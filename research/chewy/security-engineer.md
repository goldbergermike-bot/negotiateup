**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + Equity + Bonus | Pet Health & Commerce Platform | 84% Autoship Recurring Revenue | Pet Humanization Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

| Plantation FL | $135K–$178K | $32K–$52K | 10–15% | $182K–$252K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Chewy is the #1 online pet retailer with 20M+ active customers and $12B+ in annual revenue, and as a Security Engineer you protect the data, transactions, and health information of millions of pet parents across Chewy's expanding Pet Health ecosystem. The 84% Autoship penetration rate creates best-in-class recurring revenue with SaaS-like predictability, and your security engineering work directly protects the payment data, subscription credentials, and health records that underpin this recurring revenue engine. You are not a standard e-commerce security engineer — you are a Pet Health security architect protecting healthcare data, pharmacy records, and insurance information for 200M+ American pets and their families.

**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As a Security Engineer, I protect the customer data, payment systems, and health records that make the 84% Autoship retention rate possible — a single breach could destroy the trust that sustains this recurring revenue. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce — and security is the trust foundation that makes retention possible. My comp should reflect that I'm protecting the most stable revenue base in retail from existential threats. A security incident doesn't just cost money — it destroys the customer trust that drives 84% subscription retention. (2) I'm not securing a shopping cart — I'm a Pet Health security architect. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. I'm protecting PHI (Protected Health Information), pharmacy prescription data, insurance claims, and telehealth session security for 200M+ pets and their families. (3) My ask: 'I'm a Pet Health security architect protecting 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect the healthcare security complexity and the existential risk I'm mitigating, not standard e-commerce security rates.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — each new vertical brings additional security requirements (HIPAA, state pharmacy regulations, insurance data protection), and my security work enables compliant entry into these markets."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "The 84% Autoship retention rate depends on customer trust, and customer trust depends on security. I'm the engineer ensuring that 20M+ customers' payment data, subscription credentials, and health information remain protected. My RSU package should reflect that I'm safeguarding the trust foundation of SaaS-like recurring revenue — a breach would be an existential threat to this business model."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "I'm not securing a standard checkout flow — I'm protecting veterinary telehealth sessions, pharmacy prescription data, pet insurance claims, and health records. This requires HIPAA compliance engineering, healthcare data encryption, pharmacy regulation adherence, and insurance data protection. My compensation should reflect healthcare security engineer rates, which command a significant premium over standard e-commerce security."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "I'm protecting the data of 20M+ active customers across commerce, subscription, health, and financial services verticals. The attack surface, regulatory requirements, and data governance complexity at this scale match security engineering roles at top-tier tech and fintech companies. My compensation should reflect that platform-scale security ownership."
4. **Regulatory & Compliance Complexity:** "Chewy's expansion into Pet Health means I'm navigating PCI-DSS for payments, HIPAA for health data, state pharmacy board regulations, insurance data protection requirements, and CCPA/state privacy laws — simultaneously. This multi-regulatory security landscape is far more complex than standard e-commerce security, and the compliance expertise I bring justifies premium compensation above retail security benchmarks."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $170K base and $50K RSUs over 4 years for this Security Engineer position. I'm protecting Pet Health data across HIPAA, pharmacy, and insurance regulations — not just standard PCI-DSS e-commerce security. The 84% Autoship recurring revenue depends entirely on the customer trust my security work preserves. I have competing offers from CrowdStrike at $248K TC / Palo Alto Networks at $240K TC." Accept at $160K+ base and $44K+ RSUs.
