You are not a senior e-commerce developer — you are a senior Pet Health architect designing the scalable infrastructure for the future of care for 200M+ American pets.

**Level Mapping:** Chewy Senior Software Engineer = Google L5 = Amazon SDE II–III = Meta E5 = Microsoft Senior SDE 62–63 = Apple ICT4

**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As a Senior Software Engineer, I own the architecture and technical direction of systems that sustain 84% subscription retention at massive scale. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce. My comp should reflect that I'm designing senior-level systems on the most stable revenue base in retail, not gambling on growth-stage uncertainty. My architectural decisions directly protect and grow this recurring revenue engine. (2) I'm not a senior e-commerce developer — I'm a senior Pet Health architect. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. I'm designing the distributed systems, data pipelines, and service architectures that power healthcare for 200M+ pets. (3) My ask: 'I'm a senior Pet Health architect building on 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect both the healthcare complexity I'm designing for and the recurring revenue stability I'm protecting, not standard e-commerce senior engineer rates.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — my senior architectural work directly enables this multi-vertical expansion, justifying premium compensation above e-commerce benchmarks."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration means my RSUs are backed by the most predictable revenue in consumer tech. As a senior engineer, I'm designing the systems that maintain this 84% retention rate across 20M+ customers. I want my equity package to reflect that I'm protecting and growing SaaS-like recurring revenue, not speculating on uncertain growth."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "At the senior level, I'm not optimizing a checkout flow — I'm designing the distributed platform architecture for Chewy Health, veterinary telehealth integration, pharmacy fulfillment systems, and pet insurance infrastructure. This is healthcare-grade systems design. My comp should reflect healthcare platform complexity, not retail e-commerce benchmarks."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "As a senior engineer serving 20M+ active customers, I'm designing systems that handle real-time personalization, subscription orchestration, fulfillment routing, and health data management at scale. This is the same class of distributed systems challenges found at top-tier tech companies, and my compensation should reflect that platform-scale responsibility."
4. **Technical Leadership & Mentorship Multiplier:** "As a senior engineer, my impact extends beyond my own code — I'm setting technical direction, mentoring junior engineers, conducting architecture reviews, and making build-vs-buy decisions that affect Chewy's entire engineering org. This leadership multiplier means my contribution scales across the team, and my comp should reflect that organizational impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $185K base and $55K RSUs over 4 years for this Senior Software Engineer position. I bring senior-level architecture skills to Chewy's Pet Health platform — not a standard e-commerce stack. The 84% Autoship recurring revenue base and expansion into veterinary telehealth, pharmacy, and insurance create healthcare-grade systems complexity that demands premium compensation. I have competing offers from Amazon at $265K TC / Datadog at $248K TC." Accept at $175K+ base and $48K+ RSUs.
