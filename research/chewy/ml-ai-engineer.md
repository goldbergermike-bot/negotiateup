**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As an ML/AI Engineer, I build the intelligent systems that sustain 84% subscription retention through personalization, optimize health outcomes through predictive models, and drive revenue growth through recommendation engines at scale. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce — and ML/AI is the intelligence layer that continuously optimizes it. My comp should reflect that I'm building AI on the most stable revenue base in retail, not gambling on growth-stage uncertainty. My recommendation models, personalization algorithms, and churn prediction systems directly protect and grow recurring revenue. (2) I'm not building e-commerce recommendation widgets — I'm a Pet Health AI architect. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. I'm building ML models that predict pet health needs, optimize medication dosing recommendations, match pets with veterinarians, power pharmacy recommendation systems, and personalize wellness plans for 200M+ pets. (3) My ask: 'I'm a Pet Health AI architect building on 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect the healthcare ML complexity, the AI talent premium, and the recurring revenue stability — not standard e-commerce ML rates. I expect a 15–25% AI premium on top of base engineering comp.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — my ML models are the intelligence that makes personalized pet health at scale possible, justifying top-of-market AI engineering compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "My ML models directly power the 84% Autoship retention rate — personalization scoring, churn prediction, next-best-action recommendations, and subscription optimization all run on the AI systems I build. My RSU package should reflect that I'm the AI engine behind SaaS-like retention, with equity backed by the most predictable revenue in consumer tech. The AI premium in my comp is justified by the direct revenue impact of my models."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "I'm not building 'customers who bought this also bought' widgets — I'm developing pet health prediction models, veterinary telehealth matching algorithms, pharmacy recommendation systems, medication adherence prediction, and wellness scoring ML pipelines. This is healthcare AI requiring domain expertise in health outcome modeling, clinical data, and safety-critical ML systems. My compensation should reflect health-tech AI engineer rates with the appropriate AI talent premium."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "My ML models serve 20M+ active customers in real-time — personalization at login, recommendation at browse, prediction at subscription renewal, and health intelligence at every pet care touchpoint. The scale of inference, the training data volume, and the model serving infrastructure match ML engineering challenges at top-tier AI companies. My compensation should reflect that platform-scale AI impact."
4. **AI Talent Scarcity Premium:** "ML/AI engineers with production experience at scale are among the most sought-after talent in the industry. My ability to build, deploy, and maintain ML systems serving millions of users justifies a 15–25% AI premium over standard software engineering compensation. Chewy's expansion into AI-powered pet health makes this even more critical — I'm bringing rare AI expertise to a domain with massive growth potential."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $195K base and $60K RSUs over 4 years for this ML/AI Engineer position, including the AI talent premium. I'm building Pet Health AI systems, not standard e-commerce recommendations — the 84% Autoship retention engine, personalized health predictions, and pharmacy recommendation models require healthcare-grade ML engineering. I have competing offers from Google at $310K TC / OpenAI at $325K TC." Accept at $185K+ base and $52K+ RSUs.
