**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As a Product Designer, I design the user experiences that sustain 84% subscription retention and make Chewy the emotional center of pet parenthood. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce — and design is a core driver of that retention. My comp should reflect that I'm crafting experiences on the most stable revenue base in retail, not gambling on growth-stage uncertainty. Every subscription management flow, every re-order experience, every health dashboard I design protects this recurring revenue. (2) I'm not designing e-commerce product pages — I'm designing the healthcare experience for 200M+ pets. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. I'm creating the UX for telehealth consultations, medication management, insurance enrollment, and wellness tracking — healthcare design work. (3) My ask: 'I'm a Pet Health experience architect designing on 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect the healthcare UX complexity and the emotional design sophistication driving retention, not standard e-commerce designer rates.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — my design work determines how pet parents emotionally engage with these new health services, justifying premium design compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "The 84% Autoship retention rate is partially a design achievement — the subscription management UX, re-order flows, and personalization interfaces I design directly protect this revenue engine. My RSU package should reflect that design is a critical lever in maintaining SaaS-like retention, and my equity is backed by proven, predictable revenue."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "I'm not designing product listing pages — I'm creating the user experience for veterinary telehealth consultations, pharmacy medication management, pet insurance enrollment, and wellness tracking dashboards. This is healthcare UX design requiring empathy for anxious pet parents, understanding of clinical workflows, and compliance with health information display standards. My compensation should reflect health-tech design rates."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "My design decisions impact 20M+ active customers across commerce, health, and subscription experiences. Designing at this scale — with rigorous A/B testing, accessibility requirements, and multi-platform consistency — matches the complexity of design roles at top-tier consumer tech companies. My compensation should reflect that platform-scale design ownership."
4. **Emotional Design & Brand Loyalty:** "Chewy is uniquely positioned at the intersection of commerce and emotional connection — pet parents have a deeply personal relationship with their pets, and my design work channels that emotion into trust, loyalty, and lifetime value. The emotional design sophistication required to navigate pet health anxiety, celebration, and daily care is a specialized skill that goes far beyond standard e-commerce design."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $135K base and $38K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Designer position. I'm designing Pet Health experiences, not standard e-commerce layouts — the 84% Autoship retention is driven by UX, and expansion into telehealth, pharmacy, and insurance requires healthcare-grade design thinking. I have competing offers from Spotify at $185K TC / Shopify at $178K TC." Accept at $128K+ base and $33K+ RSUs.
