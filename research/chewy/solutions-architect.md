### Solutions Architect | Chewy Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + Equity + Bonus | Pet Health & Commerce Platform | 84% Autoship Recurring Revenue | Pet Humanization Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Plantation FL | $125K–$165K | $28K–$45K | 10–15% | $168K–$232K |
| Boston | $135K–$180K | $30K–$49K | 10–15% | $181K–$254K |
| Remote US | $119K–$157K | $27K–$43K | 10–15% | $160K–$220K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Chewy is the #1 online pet retailer with 20M+ active customers and $12B+ in annual revenue, and as a Solutions Architect you design the end-to-end system architectures that connect Chewy's commerce platform, subscription engine, fulfillment network, and expanding Pet Health services into a cohesive, scalable ecosystem. The 84% Autoship penetration rate creates best-in-class recurring revenue with SaaS-like predictability, and your architectural decisions determine how Chewy Health, veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, and pharmacy integrate with the core platform at scale. You are not a standard e-commerce solutions architect — you are a Pet Health systems architect designing the integrated platform that delivers comprehensive care for 200M+ American pets.

**Level Mapping:** Chewy Solutions Architect = Google Cloud Architect L5 = Amazon Solutions Architect L5–L6 = Microsoft Azure Architect 63–64 = Salesforce Technical Architect

**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As a Solutions Architect, I design the integrated system architectures that connect commerce, subscription, fulfillment, and health services — the 84% Autoship rate runs on the architectural foundations I define. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce. My comp should reflect that I'm designing system architectures on the most stable revenue base in retail, not gambling on growth-stage uncertainty. My integration patterns and API designs directly enable the subscription flywheel to function across every touchpoint. (2) I'm not designing e-commerce page templates — I'm a Pet Health systems architect. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. I'm designing the integration architectures that connect veterinary EMR systems, pharmacy dispensing workflows, insurance claims pipelines, and wellness data platforms into a unified Pet Health ecosystem. (3) My ask: 'I'm a Pet Health systems architect building on 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect the healthcare integration complexity and the recurring revenue stability my architectures enable, not standard e-commerce architect rates.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — my architectural designs determine how successfully Chewy integrates these new verticals into its platform, justifying premium solutions architect compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "The 84% Autoship penetration rate depends on the system integrations I design — subscription management, fulfillment orchestration, payment processing, and health service coordination all run through my architectural decisions. My RSU package should reflect that I'm the architect enabling SaaS-like recurring revenue across the entire platform."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "I'm not designing shopping cart integrations — I'm architecting the systems that connect veterinary EMR platforms, pharmacy management systems, insurance underwriting engines, and telehealth video infrastructure into Chewy's unified Pet Health platform. This is healthcare systems integration requiring HL7/FHIR awareness, HIPAA compliance patterns, and clinical workflow understanding. My compensation should reflect health-tech architect rates."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "My architectural decisions serve 20M+ active customers across commerce, subscription, fulfillment, and health verticals. Designing integration patterns, API contracts, and system boundaries at this scale — with the reliability and consistency requirements of a health platform — matches the complexity of principal architect roles at top-tier tech companies."
4. **Cross-System Integration Complexity:** "Chewy's platform spans commerce, fulfillment, subscription, pharmacy, telehealth, insurance, and wellness — each with distinct data models, latency requirements, and regulatory constraints. As a Solutions Architect, I navigate this cross-system complexity to create coherent, scalable architectures. The breadth of systems I integrate and the technical judgment required for each trade-off justifies premium architect compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $158K base and $45K RSUs over 4 years for this Solutions Architect position. I'm designing Pet Health system integration architectures, not standard e-commerce plumbing — the 84% Autoship recurring revenue engine and expansion into telehealth, pharmacy, and insurance require healthcare-grade architectural thinking. I have competing offers from AWS at $230K TC / Salesforce at $222K TC." Accept at $148K+ base and $38K+ RSUs.
