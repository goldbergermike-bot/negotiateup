**Level Mapping:** Chewy Product Manager = Google PM L5 = Amazon Sr. PM L6 = Meta PM IC5 = Microsoft PM 62–63 = Apple PM ICT4

**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As a Product Manager, I define the product strategy and user experience that sustain 84% subscription retention and drive Chewy's expansion into healthcare verticals. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce. My comp should reflect that I'm making product decisions on the most stable revenue base in retail, not gambling on growth-stage uncertainty. My product roadmap directly protects and grows this recurring revenue engine. (2) I'm not a standard e-commerce PM — I'm a Pet Health product strategist. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. I'm defining the product vision, user journeys, and feature strategy for healthcare services that serve 200M+ pets. (3) My ask: 'I'm a Pet Health product strategist building on 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect the healthcare product complexity and recurring revenue stability I'm stewarding, not standard e-commerce PM rates.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — my product decisions directly determine which new verticals Chewy enters and how successfully, justifying premium PM compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "My product decisions directly affect the 84% Autoship retention rate — the most valuable metric in Chewy's business. Every feature I prioritize, every UX flow I design, every experiment I run either strengthens or risks that subscription flywheel. My RSU package should reflect that I'm stewarding a SaaS-like revenue engine with my product strategy."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "I'm not prioritizing shopping cart features — I'm defining the product strategy for veterinary telehealth encounters, pharmacy medication management, pet insurance enrollment flows, and wellness recommendation systems. This is healthcare product management requiring domain expertise in health UX, regulatory compliance, and clinical workflows. My compensation should reflect health-tech PM rates."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "My product decisions impact 20M+ active customers across multiple product verticals — commerce, health, subscription, and services. The experimentation rigor, data analysis, and user research required at this scale matches the complexity of top-tier consumer tech PM roles. My compensation should reflect that platform-scale product ownership."
4. **Cross-Vertical Product Strategy:** "As a PM at Chewy, I'm not optimizing a single product — I'm navigating the intersection of commerce, healthcare, subscription, and services. This cross-vertical product strategy requires understanding multiple business models, regulatory environments, and user needs simultaneously. The breadth and complexity of this product domain justifies compensation above single-vertical PM benchmarks."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $170K base and $55K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Manager position. I'm defining Pet Health product strategy, not standard e-commerce features — the 84% Autoship recurring revenue and expansion into telehealth, pharmacy, and insurance demand healthcare-grade product thinking. I have competing offers from Amazon at $250K TC / DoorDash at $240K TC." Accept at $160K+ base and $48K+ RSUs.
