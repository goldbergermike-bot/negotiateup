**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As a Data Engineer, I build the data infrastructure and pipelines that make the 84% Autoship retention rate measurable, optimizable, and scalable — every personalization model, every retention analysis, every health insight runs on the data platform I engineer. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce — and data infrastructure is the foundation that enables continuous optimization of that retention. My comp should reflect that I'm building the data backbone of the most stable revenue base in retail, not gambling on growth-stage uncertainty. (2) I'm not building product catalog ETL jobs — I'm a Pet Health data infrastructure architect. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. I'm building the data lakes, streaming pipelines, and warehouse architectures that unify pet health records, pharmacy dispensing data, insurance claims, and wellness metrics into a comprehensive Pet Health data platform for 200M+ pets. (3) My ask: 'I'm a Pet Health data infrastructure architect building on 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect the healthcare data engineering complexity and recurring revenue stability my platforms enable, not standard e-commerce data engineering rates.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — my data engineering work creates the unified data foundation that makes multi-vertical expansion possible, justifying premium data engineering compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "Every optimization of the 84% Autoship retention rate depends on the data pipelines I build — churn analysis, personalization features, subscription timing models, and LTV calculations all run on my data infrastructure. My RSU package should reflect that I'm the foundation enabling SaaS-like retention optimization, with equity backed by the most predictable revenue in consumer tech."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "I'm not building product catalog ETL — I'm engineering the data platforms that unify veterinary health records, pharmacy prescription data, insurance claims, telehealth session logs, and wellness tracking metrics. This is healthcare data engineering requiring HIPAA-aware pipelines, health data governance, and clinical data modeling. My compensation should reflect health-tech data engineering rates."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "My data pipelines process data from 20M+ active customers across commerce, subscription, health, and fulfillment systems — billions of events daily requiring real-time streaming, batch processing, and analytical querying at massive scale. This data engineering complexity matches the challenges at top-tier tech companies, and my compensation should reflect that scale."
4. **Proprietary Pet Health Data Platform:** "Chewy's data platform combines purchase behavior, subscription patterns, pharmacy records, telehealth interactions, and pet profile data into one of the most valuable proprietary pet health datasets in existence. As a data engineer, I'm the architect making this unified data asset possible. This unique data platform advantage is a strategic moat, and building it justifies premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $150K base and $42K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Engineer position. I'm building Pet Health data infrastructure, not standard e-commerce ETL — the 84% Autoship retention engine and expansion into telehealth, pharmacy, and insurance require healthcare-grade data pipelines and governance. I have competing offers from Databricks at $218K TC / Snowflake at $210K TC." Accept at $140K+ base and $36K+ RSUs.
