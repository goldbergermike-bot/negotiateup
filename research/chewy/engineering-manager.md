**Level Mapping:** Chewy Engineering Manager = Google EM L6 = Amazon SDM L6 = Meta M1 = Microsoft EM 65–66 = Apple EM3–EM4

**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As an Engineering Manager, I build, lead, and scale the teams that sustain 84% subscription retention and deliver Chewy's expansion into healthcare verticals. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce. My comp should reflect that I'm leading engineering teams on the most stable revenue base in retail, not gambling on growth-stage uncertainty. My team's output directly protects and grows this recurring revenue flywheel. (2) I'm not managing an e-commerce engineering team — I'm leading Pet Health architects. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. I'm recruiting, retaining, and developing the engineers who build healthcare infrastructure for 200M+ pets. (3) My ask: 'I'm leading Pet Health engineering teams building on 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect the healthcare complexity my teams tackle, the leadership multiplier of my role, and the recurring revenue stability — not standard e-commerce EM rates.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — my engineering leadership directly enables this multi-vertical expansion by building the teams that execute on it."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "As an EM, my teams own the systems behind 84% Autoship retention. Chewy's SaaS-like revenue predictability makes this equity among the safest in consumer tech. I want my RSU package to reflect that I'm leading the teams protecting a proven revenue engine, with a grant that matches the stability I'm stewarding."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "I'm not managing a team building shopping features — I'm leading engineers developing veterinary telehealth systems, pharmacy fulfillment platforms, pet insurance infrastructure, and wellness recommendation engines. This is healthcare engineering management, and my comp should reflect healthcare EM rates, not retail e-commerce management benchmarks."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "My teams serve 20M+ active customers across multiple product verticals. Managing engineering teams at this scale — with the reliability, performance, and data governance requirements of a health platform — is equivalent to EM roles at top-tier tech companies. My compensation should reflect that platform-scale leadership responsibility."
4. **Talent Retention & Team Building Multiplier:** "As an EM, my impact is measured through the teams I build and retain. In a competitive market for engineering talent, my ability to recruit, develop, and retain Pet Health architects directly determines Chewy's execution velocity. My compensation should reflect this organizational leverage — every strong hire I make and retain multiplies Chewy's engineering capacity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $220K base and $68K RSUs over 4 years for this Engineering Manager position. I'm leading Pet Health engineering teams, not a standard e-commerce squad — the 84% Autoship recurring revenue base and expansion into telehealth, pharmacy, and insurance require healthcare-grade engineering leadership. I have competing offers from Amazon at $325K TC / Instacart at $310K TC." Accept at $210K+ base and $58K+ RSUs.
