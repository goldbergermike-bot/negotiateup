### Software Engineer | Chewy Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + Equity + Bonus | Pet Health & Commerce Platform | 84% Autoship Recurring Revenue | Pet Humanization Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Plantation FL | $105K–$140K | $25K–$40K | 10–15% | $142K–$198K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Chewy is the #1 online pet retailer in the United States with 20M+ active customers and $12B+ in annual revenue. As a Software Engineer at Chewy, you are not building a standard e-commerce shopping cart — you are architecting the digital backbone of a Pet Health platform that is rapidly expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy fulfillment, and wellness services through Chewy Health. The company's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates best-in-class recurring revenue that rivals SaaS business models, meaning your engineering work compounds on the most predictable revenue base in consumer retail. Frame yourself as a Pet Health architect building the future of care for 200M+ pets in America, not as a generic e-commerce developer.

**Level Mapping:** Chewy Software Engineer = Google L3–L4 = Amazon SDE I–II = Meta E3–E4 = Microsoft SDE 59–61

**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As a Software Engineer, I'm building the systems that power 84% subscription retention — the hardest engineering problem in commerce. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce. My comp should reflect that I'm building on the most stable revenue base in retail, not gambling on growth-stage uncertainty. I'm engineering systems that maintain and grow this subscription flywheel for 20M+ customers. (2) I'm not building a shopping cart — I'm building the healthcare platform for 200M+ pets. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. My code touches pet health outcomes, not just product listings. (3) My ask reflects my role as a Pet Health architect building on 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect the healthcare complexity and recurring revenue stability, not standard e-commerce rates. (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — my engineering work directly enables this TAM expansion from retail into health services, justifying compensation above standard e-commerce benchmarks."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration gives me confidence in the equity component of my compensation. Unlike speculative pre-IPO equity, CHWY stock is backed by SaaS-like recurring revenue in a $150B+ market. I'm comfortable with meaningful RSU allocation because the business model de-risks the equity — I want to ensure my RSU grant reflects this stability advantage."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "I want to clarify my understanding of this role — I'm not joining as an e-commerce developer. Chewy Health, veterinary telehealth, pharmacy fulfillment, and pet insurance require healthcare-grade engineering complexity. My compensation should reflect that I'm building health infrastructure, not a standard retail checkout flow."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "Serving 20M+ active customers with real-time personalization, subscription management, and fulfillment orchestration is platform-scale engineering. The systems I'll build handle complexity comparable to top-tier tech platforms, and my comp should reflect that engineering challenge."
4. **Post-IPO Equity Upside with Proven Model:** "CHWY is a post-IPO stock with proven unit economics and 84% recurring revenue. My RSU package isn't a lottery ticket — it's equity in a company with demonstrated retention and expanding TAM. I'd like the RSU component to reflect this lower-risk, higher-certainty equity profile."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $135K base and $40K RSUs over 4 years for this Software Engineer position. I'm joining Chewy as a Pet Health architect, not a standard e-commerce developer — the 84% Autoship recurring revenue base and expansion into veterinary telehealth and pharmacy create healthcare-grade engineering complexity. I have competing offers from Amazon at $175K TC / Shopify at $168K TC." Accept at $130K+ base and $35K+ RSUs.
