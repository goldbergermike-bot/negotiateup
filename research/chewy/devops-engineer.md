**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As a DevOps Engineer, I build and maintain the infrastructure that ensures 84% subscription fulfillment executes flawlessly — every delivery, every health service interaction, every pharmacy order depends on my systems staying up. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce — and infrastructure reliability is what delivers on that promise. My comp should reflect that I'm safeguarding the most stable revenue base in retail. Any downtime directly impacts recurring revenue, making my role mission-critical. (2) I'm not running e-commerce servers — I'm a Pet Health infrastructure architect. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. I'm building the CI/CD pipelines, observability platforms, and infrastructure-as-code that enable healthcare-grade reliability for 200M+ pets. (3) My ask: 'I'm a Pet Health infrastructure architect safeguarding 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect the healthcare reliability requirements and recurring revenue stability I'm protecting, not standard e-commerce DevOps rates.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — my infrastructure work enables the reliability guarantees these health services demand, justifying premium DevOps compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "Every Autoship order depends on my infrastructure — the 84% recurring revenue that makes Chewy's equity predictable literally runs on the systems I build and maintain. My RSU package should reflect that I'm the reliability backbone of a SaaS-like revenue engine. Infrastructure downtime directly impacts recurring revenue, making my equity grant a reflection of the risk I'm mitigating."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "I'm not managing a standard web stack — I'm building healthcare-grade infrastructure for veterinary telehealth video, pharmacy fulfillment systems, insurance claims processing, and health data pipelines. This requires HIPAA-aware infrastructure, healthcare uptime SLAs, and compliance-ready CI/CD pipelines. My compensation should reflect healthcare infrastructure engineer rates."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "My infrastructure serves 20M+ active customers with real-time subscription processing, fulfillment orchestration, and health service delivery. The scale, reliability, and performance requirements match SRE/DevOps roles at top-tier tech companies. My compensation should reflect that platform-scale infrastructure ownership."
4. **24/7 Reliability & On-Call Criticality:** "Chewy's subscription and health services run 24/7 — pet health doesn't pause for maintenance windows. My on-call responsibility, incident response leadership, and disaster recovery planning ensure that millions of pet parents can always access food, medication, and health services for their pets. This always-on criticality demands compensation that reflects the operational burden and stakes involved."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $150K base and $42K RSUs over 4 years for this DevOps Engineer position. I'm building Pet Health infrastructure, not standard e-commerce hosting — the 84% Autoship recurring revenue and expansion into telehealth, pharmacy, and insurance require healthcare-grade reliability.
