### Staff Software Engineer | Chewy Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + Equity + Bonus | Pet Health & Commerce Platform | 84% Autoship Recurring Revenue | Pet Humanization Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Plantation FL | $190K–$250K | $50K–$80K | 10–15% | $262K–$365K |
| Boston | $205K–$272K | $54K–$88K | 10–15% | $283K–$399K |
| Remote US | $181K–$238K | $48K–$76K | 10–15% | $249K–$347K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Chewy is the #1 online pet retailer with 20M+ active customers and $12B+ in annual revenue, and at the Staff Software Engineer level you are a principal technical leader shaping Chewy's multi-year platform evolution from pet commerce into a full-spectrum Pet Health ecosystem. The 84% Autoship penetration rate represents the most predictable recurring revenue model in consumer retail, and your staff-level architectural vision directly determines how Chewy Health, veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, and pharmacy scale across the organization. You are not a staff-level e-commerce engineer — you are a principal Pet Health architect defining the technical strategy for the future of care for 200M+ American pets.

**Level Mapping:** Chewy Staff Software Engineer = Google L6 = Amazon Principal SDE = Meta E6 = Microsoft Principal SDE 65–66 = Apple ICT5–ICT6

**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As a Staff Software Engineer, I define the multi-year technical strategy and cross-organizational architecture that sustains 84% subscription retention and enables Chewy's expansion into entirely new verticals. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce. My comp should reflect that I'm setting the principal-level technical direction on the most stable revenue base in retail, not gambling on growth-stage uncertainty. My architectural decisions have multi-year, multi-million-dollar impact. (2) I'm not a staff-level e-commerce engineer — I'm a principal Pet Health architect. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. I'm defining the platform architecture, API strategy, data infrastructure, and service mesh that enable healthcare delivery for 200M+ pets. (3) My ask: 'I'm a principal Pet Health architect building on 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect the executive-level technical strategy I provide, the healthcare platform complexity, and the recurring revenue stability — not standard e-commerce staff engineer rates.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — my staff-level platform architecture directly enables this multi-billion-dollar TAM expansion, justifying compensation at the top of the market."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "At the staff level, I'm the architect ensuring the systems behind 84% Autoship retention scale reliably and evolve strategically. Chewy's SaaS-like recurring revenue makes this equity among the most predictable in consumer tech. My RSU package should reflect that I'm stewarding a proven revenue engine, and I want a grant that matches my staff-level impact on that stability."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "At the staff level, I'm not optimizing a retail platform — I'm defining the entire technical strategy for Chewy's expansion into healthcare, telehealth, insurance, and pharmacy. This requires HIPAA-aware architecture, healthcare data governance, cross-vertical platform design, and regulatory-compliant systems. My compensation should reflect healthcare platform architect rates, not e-commerce senior IC rates."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "As a staff engineer, I own the cross-cutting architecture serving 20M+ active customers across commerce, health, and subscription verticals. I'm making principal-level technical decisions — build vs. buy, platform consolidation, API strategy, data mesh architecture — that affect every engineering team at Chewy. This organizational-scale impact demands staff-level compensation."
4. **Cross-Organizational Technical Strategy:** "Staff engineers at Chewy influence technical direction across multiple teams and business units. I'm defining the architectural principles, technology selection, and platform evolution strategy that shape Chewy's engineering org for years. This strategic, organization-wide influence is the hallmark of staff-level compensation, and my package should reflect the breadth and duration of my impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $240K base and $80K RSUs over 4 years for this Staff Software Engineer position. At the staff level, I'm defining Chewy's multi-year technical platform strategy across Pet Health, telehealth, pharmacy, and the 84% Autoship engine. This is principal-level healthcare platform architecture, not standard e-commerce work. I have competing offers from Google at $385K TC / Stripe at $370K TC." Accept at $225K+ base and $70K+ RSUs.
