**Negotiation DNA**

Chewy is the #1 online pet retailer with 20M+ active customers and $12B+ in annual revenue, and the Pet Health AI Engineer is Chewy's signature technical role — the engineer who sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence, veterinary health science, and the most powerful subscription commerce engine in retail. The 84% Autoship penetration rate creates best-in-class recurring revenue with SaaS-like predictability, and this role directly builds the AI systems that transform Chewy from a pet commerce platform into the intelligent health platform for 200M+ American pets. This is not a standard ML engineer role — this is the role that builds pet health ML diagnostics, Autoship personalization AI, veterinary telehealth matching algorithms, pet wellness prediction models, and pharmacy recommendation systems. Your compensation includes a 20–30% AI Premium reflecting both the extreme scarcity of AI talent and the unique domain expertise required at the intersection of machine learning and veterinary health.

**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As a Pet Health AI Engineer — Chewy's signature AI role — I build the intelligent systems at the core of Chewy's transformation: pet health ML diagnostics that detect wellness changes from purchase patterns, Autoship personalization AI that optimizes the 84% subscription engine, veterinary telehealth matching algorithms that connect pets with the right veterinarians, pet wellness prediction models that proactively identify health risks, and pharmacy recommendation systems that ensure medication adherence. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce — and I'm building the AI that makes this subscription engine even smarter. My comp should reflect that I'm building next-generation AI on the most stable revenue base in retail, not gambling on growth-stage uncertainty. My Autoship personalization AI directly increases retention, LTV, and basket size across 20M+ customers. (2) I'm the definition of a Pet Health architect — not an e-commerce developer. I build ML diagnostics that infer pet health signals from behavioral data, recommendation systems that match pets with veterinarians and medications, and prediction models that identify wellness risks before they become emergencies. This is healthcare AI requiring veterinary domain expertise, clinical safety awareness, and health outcome modeling. (3) My ask: 'I'm a Pet Health AI architect — the signature AI role at Chewy — building on 84% recurring revenue. My comp should reflect the unique intersection of AI expertise, veterinary health domain knowledge, and healthcare platform complexity. I expect a 20–30% AI premium reflecting both AI talent scarcity and veterinary health specialization. This is not standard e-commerce ML work — this is the AI that transforms pet commerce into pet healthcare.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness. My AI systems are the intelligence layer that makes this expansion possible — pet health diagnostics, pharmacy AI, telehealth matching, and wellness prediction are the products that capture this expanding TAM. My compensation should reflect that I'm building the AI products that drive Chewy's next $10B in revenue."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "My Autoship personalization AI directly optimizes the 84% subscription retention rate — I build the models that determine when to suggest subscription changes, what products to recommend for a pet's life stage, and how to predict churn before it happens. My RSU package should reflect that I'm the AI architect behind the most predictable revenue engine in consumer tech. The 20–30% AI premium in my comp is justified by the direct, measurable revenue impact of my Autoship AI models on subscription retention and LTV."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "I am the Pet Health architect role incarnate. I build pet health ML diagnostics that detect wellness changes from purchase pattern anomalies, veterinary telehealth matching algorithms that consider pet species, condition, location, and vet specialty, pharmacy recommendation systems that ensure medication adherence and flag interaction risks, and wellness prediction models that proactively alert pet parents to health risks. This requires veterinary domain knowledge, clinical safety awareness, health outcome modeling expertise, and safety-critical ML systems design. My compensation must reflect healthcare AI engineer rates — not e-commerce ML rates — with a premium for veterinary specialization."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "My AI systems serve 20M+ active customers and their pets in real-time — every Autoship personalization, every health prediction, every telehealth match, every pharmacy recommendation runs on models I build and maintain. The inference scale, the training data richness (billions of purchase + health + behavioral signals), and the safety-critical nature of health predictions create ML engineering challenges that rival the most demanding AI roles in the industry."
4. **Veterinary Health AI — Unique Domain Expertise:** "The intersection of machine learning and veterinary health is an extremely rare specialization. I bring both deep ML engineering skills and understanding of pet health science — breed-specific health profiles, age-related wellness patterns, medication interactions, nutritional requirements, and veterinary clinical workflows. This dual expertise is nearly impossible to recruit for, and Chewy should compensate accordingly. The 20–30% AI premium reflects not just AI talent scarcity but the unique value of AI + veterinary health domain knowledge."
5. **Five-Domain AI Portfolio — Signature Role Breadth:** "This signature role spans five distinct AI domains: (a) Pet health ML diagnostics — inferring wellness signals from behavioral and purchase data; (b) Autoship personalization AI — optimizing the subscription engine with ML; (c) Veterinary telehealth matching — intelligent provider-patient matching algorithms; (d) Pet wellness prediction — proactive health risk identification models; (e) Pharmacy recommendation systems — medication adherence and interaction safety AI. The breadth and depth of this AI portfolio justifies signature-level compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $68K RSUs over 4 years for this Pet Health AI Engineer position — Chewy's signature AI role — including the 20–30% AI premium for veterinary health specialization. I build the five core AI systems that define Chewy's health platform: pet health diagnostics, Autoship personalization AI, telehealth matching, wellness prediction, and pharmacy recommendation. The 84% Autoship retention engine I'm optimizing with AI is the most stable revenue base in consumer tech. I have competing offers from Google Health at $345K TC / Tempus AI at $330K TC / Amazon Pharmacy at $320K TC." Accept at $210K+ base and $58K+ RSUs.
