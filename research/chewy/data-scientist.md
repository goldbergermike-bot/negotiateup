**Negotiation DNA**

Chewy is the #1 online pet retailer with 20M+ active customers and $12B+ in annual revenue, and as a Data Scientist you unlock the insights that drive Chewy's transformation from pet commerce into a comprehensive Pet Health platform. The 84% Autoship penetration rate creates best-in-class recurring revenue with SaaS-like predictability, and your statistical models, causal inference, and experimentation frameworks directly optimize this subscription flywheel while enabling Chewy Health, veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, and pharmacy expansion. You are not a standard e-commerce data scientist — you are a Pet Health data strategist using behavioral, transactional, and health data to shape the future of care for 200M+ American pets.

**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As a Data Scientist, I build the statistical models, experimentation frameworks, and causal inference systems that sustain 84% subscription retention and unlock new health revenue streams. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce — and data science is the engine that optimizes it. My comp should reflect that I'm modeling behavior on the most stable revenue base in retail, not gambling on growth-stage uncertainty. My churn prediction, lifetime value, and personalization models directly protect recurring revenue. (2) I'm not analyzing e-commerce click-through rates — I'm a Pet Health data strategist. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. I'm building models that predict pet health needs, optimize medication adherence, match pets with veterinarians, and personalize wellness plans for 200M+ pets. (3) My ask: 'I'm a Pet Health data strategist building on 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect the healthcare data complexity and recurring revenue stability I'm optimizing, not standard e-commerce analytics rates.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — my data science work determines how effectively Chewy enters and wins in these new verticals, justifying premium data science compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "My models directly optimize the 84% Autoship retention rate — churn prediction, subscription timing, personalization scoring, and LTV forecasting. This recurring revenue engine means my RSU package is backed by the most predictable revenue in consumer tech. I want my equity grant to reflect that I'm the data scientist protecting and growing a SaaS-like revenue model."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "I'm not building click-through rate models — I'm developing pet health prediction systems, medication adherence analytics, veterinary telehealth matching algorithms, and wellness scoring frameworks. This is health data science requiring domain expertise in longitudinal health data, clinical outcomes measurement, and health behavior modeling. My compensation should reflect health-tech data science rates."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "My models serve 20M+ active customers generating billions of data points across purchase, subscription, health, and behavioral dimensions. The scale of data, the experimentation velocity, and the statistical rigor required match the complexity of data science roles at top-tier tech companies. My compensation should reflect that platform-scale analytical impact."
4. **Proprietary Pet Health Data Asset:** "Chewy's combination of purchase behavior, subscription patterns, health service usage, pharmacy data, and pet profile information creates one of the most valuable proprietary pet data assets in the world. As a data scientist, I'm the one who transforms this raw data into actionable intelligence — this unique data advantage is irreplaceable and justifies premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $160K base and $48K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Scientist position. I'm building Pet Health prediction and optimization models, not standard e-commerce analytics — the 84% Autoship retention engine and expansion into telehealth, pharmacy, and insurance demand health-grade data science. I have competing offers from Spotify at $228K TC / Wayfair at $215K TC." Accept at $150K+ base and $42K+ RSUs.
