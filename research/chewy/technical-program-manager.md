**Level Mapping:** Chewy Technical Program Manager = Google TPM L5 = Amazon TPM L5–L6 = Meta TPM IC5 = Microsoft TPM 62–63 = Apple TPM ICT4

**Pet Humanization Premium — 84% Autoship Stability**

Chewy's 84% Autoship penetration rate creates the most predictable recurring revenue in e-commerce — 84% of Chewy's sales are subscription-based, giving the company SaaS-like revenue visibility in a retail business. This stability is your negotiation lever. "As a Technical Program Manager, I drive the cross-functional execution of programs that sustain 84% subscription retention and launch Chewy's healthcare verticals on time and at quality. (1) The 84% Autoship rate proves Chewy has solved retention — the hardest problem in commerce. My comp should reflect that I'm driving program execution on the most stable revenue base in retail, not gambling on growth-stage uncertainty. My program delivery directly protects the subscription flywheel and enables new revenue streams. (2) I'm not managing e-commerce feature launches — I'm a Pet Health program leader. Chewy is expanding into veterinary telehealth, pet insurance, pharmacy, and wellness. I'm orchestrating the cross-functional delivery of healthcare programs that involve engineering, design, clinical partnerships, regulatory compliance, and fulfillment operations for 200M+ pets. (3) My ask: 'I'm a Pet Health program leader executing on 84% recurring revenue — the most stable business model in consumer tech. My comp should reflect the healthcare program complexity and the recurring revenue stability I'm protecting, not standard e-commerce TPM rates.' (4) The pet humanization mega-trend ($150B+ US pet spending) means Chewy's TAM is expanding into healthcare, insurance, and wellness — my program leadership determines how quickly and successfully Chewy enters these new verticals, justifying premium TPM compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **84% Autoship — Recurring Revenue Stability:** "My programs directly protect and extend the 84% Autoship retention rate — every platform migration, feature launch, and infrastructure upgrade I drive either strengthens or risks this subscription engine. My RSU package should reflect that I'm the program leader safeguarding SaaS-like recurring revenue, with equity backed by proven, predictable business performance."
2. **Pet Health Architect — Not E-Commerce:** "I'm not shipping e-commerce features — I'm orchestrating the launch of veterinary telehealth services, pharmacy fulfillment programs, pet insurance enrollment systems, and wellness platform initiatives. These healthcare programs require navigating clinical partnerships, regulatory timelines, and compliance milestones alongside standard engineering execution. My compensation should reflect health-tech TPM rates."
3. **20M+ Active Customers — Platform Scale:** "My programs affect 20M+ active customers across multiple product verticals. The stakeholder management, risk mitigation, and cross-functional coordination required at this scale — with healthcare regulatory requirements layered on top — matches TPM complexity at top-tier tech companies. My compensation should reflect that platform-scale program ownership."
4. **Cross-Functional Orchestration Breadth:** "As a TPM at Chewy, I orchestrate across engineering, design, product, clinical, legal, regulatory, fulfillment, and customer service teams. The breadth of stakeholders and the diversity of constraints — from technical architecture to veterinary licensing — require exceptional program leadership. This cross-functional complexity and the strategic importance of the programs I drive justify premium TPM compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $148K base and $42K RSUs over 4 years for this Technical Program Manager position. I'm driving Pet Health program delivery, not standard e-commerce feature launches — the 84% Autoship recurring revenue and expansion into telehealth, pharmacy, and insurance require healthcare-grade program management. I have competing offers from Amazon at $215K TC / Microsoft at $208K TC." Accept at $140K+ base and $36K+ RSUs.
