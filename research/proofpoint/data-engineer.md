*Total compensation includes base salary, equity (phantom equity / profit-sharing units under Thoma Bravo ownership, 4-year vest), and performance bonus (typically 10%). Data engineers typically see base in the $145K-$200K range with equity grants valued at $40K-$65K/year.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Proofpoint

Data Engineers at Proofpoint build the infrastructure that ingests, processes, and analyzes billions of email messages, URLs, and attachments daily. This data powers the threat detection engines, reporting dashboards, and machine learning models that protect over 80% of Fortune 100 companies. The sheer volume and velocity of Proofpoint's data — combined with the security-critical nature of the work — makes this a uniquely demanding data engineering role.

Proofpoint's $12.1B valuation under Thoma Bravo reflects the value of its data assets. The company's ability to detect threats is directly proportional to the quality and speed of its data infrastructure. Data Engineers who can build reliable, low-latency pipelines at this scale are solving problems comparable to those at the largest tech companies.

#### Proofpoint Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Data Engineer | 2–6 years |
| L5 | Senior Data Engineer | 6–10 years |
| L6 | Staff / Principal Data Engineer | 10–15 years |

#### Lever 1: Billion-Message-Scale Data Processing

"Proofpoint processes billions of messages daily. My experience building data pipelines at [comparable scale] maps directly to this challenge. The ability to maintain sub-second processing latency at this volume is a rare skill that commands premium compensation."

#### Lever 2: Threat Intelligence Data Modeling

"Proofpoint's threat intelligence depends on data engineering excellence — structuring raw email telemetry into actionable intelligence. My experience with streaming data pipelines and security data modeling strengthens Proofpoint's core competitive advantage."

#### Lever 3: ML Feature Pipeline Infrastructure

"Proofpoint's detection models depend on feature pipelines that I would build and maintain. My experience designing ML-serving data infrastructure ensures Proofpoint's models receive high-quality, low-latency features for real-time threat classification."

#### Lever 4: Data Platform Modernization

"Proofpoint's cloud transformation requires modernizing data infrastructure for cloud-native operation. I bring experience migrating data platforms to cloud architectures while maintaining the reliability and throughput enterprises require."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $175,000 base with equity valued at $50K-$70K/year. Accept-at floor: $230,000 total comp. Cite Proofpoint's data scale, the criticality of data infrastructure to threat detection, and Thoma Bravo's growth mandate.
