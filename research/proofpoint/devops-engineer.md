#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Proofpoint

DevOps Engineers at Proofpoint are responsible for the infrastructure reliability of a platform that processes billions of email messages daily. Any downtime directly impacts enterprise customers' ability to send and receive email safely — making this a mission-critical reliability role. Proofpoint's infrastructure spans multiple data centers and cloud environments, requiring sophisticated automation and monitoring.

Under Thoma Bravo ownership ($12.1B acquisition), Proofpoint is investing in cloud transformation and infrastructure modernization. DevOps Engineers who can drive this transition while maintaining the platform's stringent uptime SLAs are in high demand.
