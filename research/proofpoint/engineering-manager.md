### Engineering Manager — Proofpoint Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering Managers at Proofpoint lead the teams that build and scale the world's leading email security platform, balancing technical execution with people leadership to deliver threat protection for over 80% of Fortune 100 companies.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Sunnyvale (USD) | Remote US (USD) | London (GBP) |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| EM (M1) | $225,000–$305,000 | $210,000–$280,000 | £100,000–£135,000 |
| Senior EM (M2) | $295,000–$380,000 | $275,000–$355,000 | £130,000–£170,000 |
| Director (M3) | $360,000–$460,000 | $335,000–$425,000 | £160,000–£205,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary ($175K-$225K for EM), equity (phantom equity / profit-sharing units, $50K-$90K/year equivalent), and performance bonus (10-15%). EMs at Proofpoint typically manage teams of 6-12 engineers.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Proofpoint

Engineering Managers at Proofpoint own the delivery and growth of teams building mission-critical security infrastructure. Under Thoma Bravo's $12.1B ownership, EMs are expected to drive both engineering velocity and operational efficiency — balancing growth investment with the profitability focus typical of private equity ownership.

Proofpoint's Sunnyvale location places EMs in competition with Big Tech and other cybersecurity companies. The EM role at Proofpoint carries significant technical depth requirements — managers are expected to make architectural decisions, not just people management choices.

#### Proofpoint Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| M1 | Engineering Manager | 8–12 years (2+ managing) |
| M2 | Senior Engineering Manager | 12–16 years (4+ managing) |
| M3 | Director of Engineering | 15+ years (6+ managing) |

#### Lever 1: Team Scale & Delivery Impact

"I'll manage a team responsible for systems processing billions of messages daily. My track record of leading teams that deliver high-reliability systems at scale — [specific example] — demonstrates I can drive the execution velocity Proofpoint needs."

#### Lever 2: Thoma Bravo Execution Standards

"Thoma Bravo portfolio companies operate under rigorous execution standards. My experience driving engineering efficiency — reducing cycle times, improving deployment frequency, and managing cost per transaction — aligns with the operational excellence Thoma Bravo expects."

#### Lever 3: Talent Retention in Competitive Market

"Proofpoint competes for engineering talent with Big Tech and public cybersecurity companies. My ability to recruit, develop, and retain top engineers — reducing turnover costs and maintaining team velocity — has direct financial impact on Proofpoint's engineering capacity."

#### Lever 4: Technical Depth + Leadership Breadth

"I bring both deep technical judgment in distributed systems and proven people leadership. This combination is rare and critical at Proofpoint, where EMs must make sound architectural decisions while growing teams to meet the platform's expanding scope."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $200,000 base with equity valued at $70K-$95K/year. Accept-at floor: $275,000 total comp. Emphasize your track record of team delivery, talent retention, and the EM scarcity in cybersecurity.
