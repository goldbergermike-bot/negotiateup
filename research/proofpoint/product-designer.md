#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Proofpoint

Product Designers at Proofpoint solve a uniquely challenging design problem: making enterprise security tools usable for security analysts who monitor threats across billions of email messages. The complexity of the threat landscape — phishing, BEC, malware, insider threats — requires designers who can present dense, technical information in ways that accelerate decision-making.

Proofpoint ($12.1B under Thoma Bravo) is increasingly investing in UX as a product differentiator. As cybersecurity products mature, user experience becomes a competitive factor in enterprise purchasing decisions. Designers who understand both security workflows and human-computer interaction principles are rare and valuable.
