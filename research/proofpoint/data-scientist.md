*Total compensation includes base salary, equity (phantom equity / profit-sharing units under Thoma Bravo ownership, 4-year vest), and performance bonus (typically 10%). Data Scientists with threat detection modeling experience command a 5-8% premium.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Proofpoint

Data Scientists at Proofpoint work on one of the most impactful applications of data science in cybersecurity — building models that classify billions of emails as benign or malicious with near-zero false-negative tolerance. The stakes are real: a missed phishing email can lead to enterprise compromise. Proofpoint's dataset, drawn from protecting over 80% of Fortune 100 companies, is one of the richest email security datasets in existence.

Under Thoma Bravo's $12.1B ownership, Proofpoint invests heavily in data science to maintain its detection edge. Data Scientists who can build classification models, anomaly detection systems, and behavioral analytics at Proofpoint's scale have leverage because this expertise is rare and directly tied to product value.

#### Proofpoint Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Data Scientist | 2–5 years |
| L5 | Senior Data Scientist | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff / Principal Data Scientist | 8–14 years |

#### Lever 1: Threat Classification at Scale

"Proofpoint's classification models must operate at billions-of-messages scale with near-zero false negatives. My experience building high-precision classification systems at scale directly maps to this challenge — the difference between 99.9% and 99.99% accuracy at Proofpoint's volume represents millions of threat decisions."

#### Lever 2: Behavioral Analytics & BEC Detection

"Business Email Compromise is one of the costliest cyber threats. My expertise in behavioral analytics and anomaly detection supports Proofpoint's BEC detection capabilities, where identifying subtle deviations in communication patterns prevents billions in enterprise losses."

#### Lever 3: Proofpoint's Unmatched Dataset

"Proofpoint's email security dataset is one of the richest in the industry. My ability to extract signal from massive, noisy datasets amplifies the value of this unique data asset — directly improving threat detection for Fortune 100 customers."

#### Lever 4: Competitive Data Science Market

"Data scientists with security domain expertise are exceptionally scarce. I'm weighing offers from [competing cybersecurity companies / Big Tech ML teams], and I need Proofpoint's offer to reflect both the specialized nature of threat detection modeling and the illiquidity of private-company equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $175,000 base with equity valued at $50K-$75K/year. Accept-at floor: $235,000 total comp. Cite Proofpoint's unique dataset advantage and the scarcity of security-domain data science expertise.
