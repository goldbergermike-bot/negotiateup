*Total compensation includes base salary, equity (phantom equity / profit-sharing units under Thoma Bravo ownership, 4-year vest), and performance bonus (typically 10%). Threat Intelligence Platform roles command a 5-10% premium over general SWE due to specialized domain expertise in threat detection and intelligence automation.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Proofpoint

This is the signature engineering role at Proofpoint. Threat Intelligence Platform Engineers build the systems that power Proofpoint's core competitive advantage — its ability to detect and block threats before they reach end users. Proofpoint's Emerging Threats intelligence feed is one of the most widely used threat intelligence sources in the industry, and the platform processes telemetry from billions of daily messages to generate actionable intelligence.

Proofpoint, acquired by Thoma Bravo for $12.1 billion, is headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA. The company protects over 80% of Fortune 100 companies from email-borne threats. Engineers in this role work at the intersection of distributed systems, machine learning, and cybersecurity — building the data pipelines, detection engines, and intelligence correlation systems that form Proofpoint's technological moat.

The combination of rare domain expertise (threat intelligence at scale) and high-demand engineering skills (distributed systems, ML pipelines) creates strong negotiation leverage. Few companies operate threat intelligence platforms at Proofpoint's scale.

#### Proofpoint Level Mapping & Internal Titles

Email remains the number-one attack vector for enterprises. Position your domain knowledge: "Over 90% of cyberattacks start with email. Proofpoint's leadership in email security means my threat intelligence expertise has direct, measurable impact on protecting the Fortune 100. This specialized knowledge commands a premium."

#### Lever 3: Targeted Attack Protection (TAP) Pipeline

Proofpoint's TAP product uses real-time threat intelligence to detect targeted attacks. Leverage ML and detection experience: "My experience building real-time detection pipelines that combine behavioral analysis, sandboxing, and threat intelligence directly supports Proofpoint TAP's evolution — the company's highest-value product for enterprise customers."

#### Lever 4: Thoma Bravo Investment & Platform Expansion

"Thoma Bravo's $12.1B investment signals that Proofpoint's threat intelligence platform is positioned for significant expansion. I'm joining at a pivotal moment where my engineering contributions directly impact the platform's value for a potential IPO or exit."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $180,000 base with equity equivalent to $60K-$90K/year. Accept-at floor: $240,000 total comp. Cite the specialized nature of threat intelligence engineering, Proofpoint's market-leading ET Intelligence feed, and Thoma Bravo's $12.1B valuation.
