#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Proofpoint

Technical Program Managers at Proofpoint drive the execution of complex, cross-functional programs that span multiple engineering teams. Under Thoma Bravo's $12.1B ownership, the company operates with a strong execution focus, and TPMs are the connective tissue that ensures programs deliver on time and within scope. Programs may include cloud platform migration, new threat detection capabilities, compliance certification initiatives, and platform scalability improvements.

The TPM role at Proofpoint requires both technical depth (understanding distributed systems, ML pipelines, and security architectures) and program execution skills (risk management, stakeholder alignment, dependency tracking). This dual expertise is scarce and valuable.

#### Proofpoint Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Technical Program Manager | 4–7 years |
| L5 | Senior Technical Program Manager | 7–11 years |
| L6 | Principal / Staff TPM | 11–16 years |

#### Lever 1: Cross-Functional Program Execution

"Proofpoint's platform initiatives span multiple engineering teams, product groups, and business functions. My experience managing cross-functional programs with [X] teams and [Y] engineers demonstrates I can drive execution at the scale Proofpoint requires."

#### Lever 2: Cloud Transformation Program Leadership

"Proofpoint's cloud transformation is a multi-year, company-wide initiative requiring careful program management. I bring experience leading cloud migration programs with zero-downtime requirements and complex dependency chains."

#### Lever 3: Thoma Bravo Execution Discipline

"Thoma Bravo portfolio companies demand rigorous execution and accountability. My program management methodology — transparent risk tracking, clear milestone ownership, and data-driven progress reporting — aligns with the execution standards Thoma Bravo expects."

#### Lever 4: Security Product Delivery Experience

"I bring experience managing programs in security-sensitive environments, where regulatory requirements, compliance certifications, and customer trust add complexity beyond typical product delivery. This domain expertise reduces program risk at Proofpoint."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $172,000 base with equity valued at $50K-$70K/year. Accept-at floor: $225,000 total comp. Cite your track record of program delivery in security-regulated environments and cross-functional leadership.
