#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Proofpoint

Security Engineers at Proofpoint carry a unique dual mandate: securing both the company's internal infrastructure and the security products that customers depend on. A security breach at Proofpoint would be catastrophic — not just operationally, but reputationally, as customers trust Proofpoint to protect them from threats. This creates an environment where security engineering is existentially important.

Under Thoma Bravo's $12.1B ownership, Proofpoint must maintain the highest security standards to protect its enterprise customer base and justify its market-leading position. Security Engineers who can build defense-in-depth across the platform while enabling engineering velocity are critical to this mission.

#### Proofpoint Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Security Engineer | 2–6 years |
| L5 | Senior Security Engineer | 6–10 years |
| L6 | Staff Security Engineer / Security Architect | 10–15 years |

#### Lever 1: Securing the Security Company

"As a security company, Proofpoint's own security posture is both a product requirement and a brand imperative. A breach at Proofpoint would undermine customer trust in ways that no other company faces. My ability to build robust internal security controls directly protects Proofpoint's most valuable asset — customer trust."

#### Lever 2: Product Security for Enterprise Customers

"Proofpoint's products handle the most sensitive enterprise communications. I bring experience in application security, secure SDLC, and threat modeling that ensures Proofpoint's products meet the rigorous security requirements of Fortune 100 customers."

#### Lever 3: Compliance & Regulatory Expertise

"Enterprise customers require FedRAMP, SOC 2, and other compliance certifications. My experience implementing and maintaining security compliance programs reduces audit risk and accelerates Proofpoint's ability to sell into regulated industries."

#### Lever 4: Security Engineering Scarcity

"Security engineers with both offensive and defensive skills are exceptionally scarce. I'm evaluating roles at [competing security companies], and Proofpoint's offer must reflect the security engineer talent premium, which is even higher at a company where security is the product."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $178,000 base with equity valued at $55K-$80K/year. Accept-at floor: $235,000 total comp. Emphasize the existential importance of security at a security company and your specialized skill set.
