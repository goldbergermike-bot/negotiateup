#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Palo Alto Networks

Data Engineers at Palo Alto Networks build the data pipelines and storage systems that process the security telemetry flowing through the entire Platformization stack. The February 11, 2026 CyberArk acquisition introduces new identity data streams — privileged access logs, authentication events, identity governance records — that must be ingested, processed, and correlated with existing network, cloud, and endpoint telemetry. Data Engineers who can build unified data pipelines across these domains are essential to Security Consolidation.

The $85M XSIAM deal is fundamentally a data engineering achievement. XSIAM processes petabytes of security telemetry in near-real-time, requiring sophisticated data pipelines, storage optimization, and query performance engineering. Data Engineers who can build and optimize these systems at scale are directly enabling the deal sizes that define Palo Alto's growth trajectory.

The intersection of data engineering and cybersecurity is a rapidly growing specialization. Palo Alto competes with Snowflake, Databricks, and major tech companies for Data Engineers who understand both large-scale data systems and security data formats. This scarcity, combined with the Platformization strategy's total dependence on data infrastructure, creates exceptional negotiation leverage.

### 🔒 Palo Alto Networks Platformization & Security Consolidation Lever

Palo Alto's February 11, 2026 CyberArk acquisition and record $85M XSIAM deal prove the Platformization thesis is working. I negotiate as a Security Consolidation architect who accelerates this multi-billion-dollar platform shift. As a Data Engineer, this means building the data infrastructure that unifies security telemetry from network, cloud, endpoint, and identity sources into a single, queryable platform — the data foundation of Security Consolidation.

The CyberArk acquisition on February 11, 2026 adds critical identity data streams to the platform. Data Engineers must build pipelines that ingest CyberArk's privileged access logs, authentication events, and identity governance data alongside Palo Alto's existing telemetry. This data integration is the technical foundation upon which Security Consolidation is built — without unified data, there is no unified platform.

The $85M XSIAM deal demonstrates that customers will pay premium prices for a platform that can process and correlate all their security data in one place. Data Engineers who can build the pipelines, storage systems, and query engines that make this possible at petabyte scale are the most critical technical hires for the Platformization roadmap.

Your negotiation frame: "Palo Alto's February 11, 2026 CyberArk acquisition and record $85M XSIAM deal prove the Platformization thesis is working. As a Data Engineer, I build the data infrastructure that makes Security Consolidation technically possible. My pipelines unify the telemetry from every product line into the single data platform that enables $85M deals."

#### Global Lever 1: XSIAM & Cortex Platform

XSIAM's $85M deal is built on a data engineering foundation. The platform ingests security telemetry from firewalls, cloud environments, endpoints, and identity systems, then correlates these signals in near-real-time for threat detection. Data Engineers on XSIAM build the ingestion pipelines, stream processing engines, data lake storage, and query optimization layers that make this possible at petabyte scale.

**Negotiation language**: "I build the data pipelines that power XSIAM — the platform that closed an $85M deal. My data engineering at petabyte scale is the foundation that makes Security Consolidation technically deliverable across the entire Platformization stack."

#### Global Lever 2: Prisma Cloud & Code-to-Cloud Security

Prisma Cloud generates vast amounts of security scan data, vulnerability findings, and runtime telemetry. Data Engineers build the pipelines that process this cloud security data and feed it into the broader Platformization data platform. The Security Consolidation strategy requires cloud security data to correlate with network and identity telemetry in XSIAM.

**Negotiation language**: "I build the data pipelines that connect Prisma Cloud's code-to-cloud telemetry with the broader Platformization data platform. My data engineering work ensures Security Consolidation has the unified data foundation that enables cross-domain threat detection."

#### Global Lever 3: Next-Gen Firewall & Zero Trust

The NGFW generates the highest volume of security telemetry in the Palo Alto ecosystem — billions of network events per day across customer deployments. Data Engineers who can build efficient pipelines for this firewall telemetry, optimize storage, and ensure queryability are essential. The Security Consolidation strategy depends on NGFW data being available for correlation in XSIAM alongside cloud and identity telemetry.

**Negotiation language**: "I build the data pipelines that process billions of NGFW events daily and make them available for cross-platform correlation. My data engineering connects the network security data layer with the broader Platformization and Security Consolidation data platform."

#### Global Lever 4: CyberArk Identity Integration

The February 11, 2026 CyberArk acquisition introduces new data streams that must be integrated into Palo Alto's data platform. CyberArk's privileged access logs, authentication events, identity risk scores, and governance records represent a new data domain that must be ingested, normalized, and made available for correlation with existing security telemetry. Data Engineers who can build these identity data pipelines are enabling the core of Security Consolidation.

**Negotiation language**: "The CyberArk acquisition from February 11, 2026 creates a new identity data domain that must be integrated into the Platformization data platform. I can build the pipelines that ingest, normalize, and correlate CyberArk identity data with network, cloud, and endpoint telemetry — enabling the unified Security Consolidation data layer."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $215,000 base with 1,100 RSUs ($220,000 at current PANW price ~$200). Your accept-at floor should be $375,000 total comp. Cite the February 11, 2026 CyberArk acquisition, the record $85M XSIAM deal, and your ability to drive Security Consolidation across the Platformization roadmap.
