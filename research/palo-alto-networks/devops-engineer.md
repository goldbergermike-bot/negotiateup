#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Palo Alto Networks

DevOps Engineers at Palo Alto Networks are the infrastructure backbone of the Platformization strategy. The February 11, 2026 CyberArk acquisition means DevOps teams must now integrate entirely new deployment pipelines, infrastructure stacks, and CI/CD workflows into Palo Alto's platform delivery engine. The complexity of running a unified Security Consolidation platform across multiple cloud environments and on-premises deployments requires world-class DevOps engineering.

The $85M XSIAM deal represents a platform that must operate at extraordinary scale — ingesting petabytes of security telemetry with sub-second latency requirements. DevOps Engineers who can build and operate the infrastructure that makes this possible are directly enabling the record-breaking deals that drive Palo Alto's growth. When you negotiate, emphasize that platform reliability and scalability at XSIAM's scale is a DevOps achievement.

DevOps talent with security platform experience is scarce. The intersection of infrastructure engineering, cloud-native operations, and cybersecurity product delivery is a niche that few engineers occupy. Palo Alto's Platformization ambitions require DevOps Engineers who can manage multi-product deployment pipelines across a unified Security Consolidation platform — this cross-product infrastructure expertise commands a significant premium.

### 🔒 Palo Alto Networks Platformization & Security Consolidation Lever

Palo Alto's February 11, 2026 CyberArk acquisition and record $85M XSIAM deal prove the Platformization thesis is working. I negotiate as a Security Consolidation architect who accelerates this multi-billion-dollar platform shift. As a DevOps Engineer, this means building the infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and operational tooling that enables four product lines to ship as one unified platform.

The CyberArk acquisition on February 11, 2026 adds new infrastructure that must be integrated into Palo Alto's deployment ecosystem. CyberArk's systems, monitoring, and operational tooling must merge with Palo Alto's existing infrastructure — a DevOps integration challenge that directly determines how quickly the Security Consolidation platform can deliver value to customers.

The $85M XSIAM deal requires infrastructure that operates at massive scale with exceptional reliability. DevOps Engineers who can build auto-scaling, self-healing infrastructure for security telemetry processing at petabyte scale are the foundation of the Platformization promise. Without DevOps excellence, the platform cannot deliver on the Security Consolidation vision.

Your negotiation frame: "Palo Alto's February 11, 2026 CyberArk acquisition and record $85M XSIAM deal prove the Platformization thesis is working. As a DevOps Engineer, I build the infrastructure and delivery systems that make Security Consolidation operationally possible. My infrastructure decisions determine whether the platform scales to support $85M deals and beyond."

#### Global Lever 1: XSIAM & Cortex Platform

XSIAM's $85M deal demands infrastructure that processes petabytes of security data with near-real-time latency. DevOps Engineers on XSIAM build and operate Kubernetes clusters, data pipeline infrastructure, ML model serving platforms, and multi-region deployment systems. The infrastructure complexity of XSIAM is among the highest at Palo Alto, and DevOps Engineers who can operate at this scale are exceptionally valuable.

**Negotiation language**: "I build the infrastructure that enables XSIAM to process security telemetry at the scale that supports $85M deals. My DevOps expertise in auto-scaling data pipelines and ML infrastructure directly drives the Security Consolidation platform's reliability and performance."

#### Global Lever 2: Prisma Cloud & Code-to-Cloud Security

Prisma Cloud's infrastructure spans multiple cloud providers and must integrate with customer cloud environments. DevOps Engineers on Prisma Cloud build the deployment automation, monitoring, and operational tooling that ensures the code-to-cloud security platform operates reliably. The Platformization strategy requires Prisma Cloud's infrastructure to integrate with Cortex and Strata systems.

**Negotiation language**: "I build multi-cloud infrastructure for Prisma Cloud that integrates with the broader Platformization delivery system. My DevOps work ensures the Security Consolidation platform operates reliably across every cloud environment our customers use."

#### Global Lever 3: Next-Gen Firewall & Zero Trust

NGFW infrastructure spans hardware appliances, virtual firewalls, and cloud-delivered security services. DevOps Engineers managing NGFW deployments handle some of the most complex infrastructure in cybersecurity — including firmware delivery, virtual appliance orchestration, and SASE edge deployments. The Security Consolidation strategy requires NGFW infrastructure to integrate with XSIAM and CyberArk systems.

**Negotiation language**: "I manage the NGFW infrastructure that generates billions in revenue while evolving delivery toward cloud and SASE. My DevOps capability bridges hardware and cloud infrastructure across the Platformization and Security Consolidation roadmap."

#### Global Lever 4: CyberArk Identity Integration

The February 11, 2026 CyberArk acquisition introduces new infrastructure stacks, deployment systems, and operational tooling that must be unified with Palo Alto's platform. DevOps Engineers who can lead this infrastructure integration — merging monitoring, alerting, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment automation — are essential to making the CyberArk acquisition operationally successful.

**Negotiation language**: "The February 11, 2026 CyberArk acquisition requires a massive infrastructure integration. I can merge CyberArk's deployment systems with Palo Alto's platform infrastructure — this DevOps integration is the operational foundation of Security Consolidation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $190,000 base with 900 RSUs ($180,000 at current PANW price ~$200). Your accept-at floor should be $340,000 total comp. Cite the February 11, 2026 CyberArk acquisition, the record $85M XSIAM deal, and your ability to drive Security Consolidation across the Platformization roadmap.
