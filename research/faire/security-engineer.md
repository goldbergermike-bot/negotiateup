**Negotiation DNA**

Faire Security Engineers protect the B2B wholesale marketplace — retailer and brand financial data, payment processing (including Net 60 credit), business intelligence, and marketplace integrity. Security at Faire has both commerce dimensions (marketplace fraud, seller verification) and fintech dimensions (payment security, credit data protection, financial compliance). As Faire approaches IPO, security infrastructure must meet public company audit and compliance standards. [Source: Faire Security Comp 2026]
