Your analyses drive decisions that shape how wholesale commerce works: which products to recommend to which retailers, how to price Faire's services, which retailers qualify for Net 60 terms, and how to optimize the two-sided marketplace for both retailers and brands. Data science at Faire has outsized impact — at a growth-stage company, analytical insights directly shape product and business strategy. [Source: Faire Data Science Comp 2026]
