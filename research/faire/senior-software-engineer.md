### Senior Software Engineer | Faire Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Startup Comp | Private $12B Valuation | B2B Wholesale Pioneer | Pre-IPO Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco (HQ) | $165K-$222K | $100K-$255K | 10% | $228K-$360K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Faire own critical systems in the B2B wholesale marketplace. At this level, you drive technical decisions for systems serving 100K+ retailers and thousands of brands — product search and discovery, order management, payments (Net 60 terms), fulfillment coordination, and the brand portal. Faire's flat engineering culture means senior engineers have significant autonomy and direct influence on product direction. The equity component at senior level is substantial with pre-IPO upside.

**Level Mapping:** Faire Senior SWE = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Shopify Senior SWE = Amazon SDE-II/III

**Global Levers**

1. **Two-Sided Marketplace Ownership:** "I own systems that serve both retailers and brands — optimizing for two distinct user types with different needs and economics."
2. **Pre-IPO Senior Equity:** "Senior-level equity in a $12B company with IPO trajectory. The grant should be $225K+ over 4 years."
3. **Flat Culture, High Scope:** "Faire's flat engineering culture means I operate with scope that would require Staff titles at larger companies."
4. **Bay Area Senior SWE Market:** "Senior SWEs in San Francisco have offers from Google, Meta, and top startups. Faire must compete."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "At the Senior level, I'll own critical systems for Faire's two-sided B2B marketplace. I'm targeting $230K in equity over 4 years and a base of $218K. I have a Google L4 offer at $[X]. Faire's pre-IPO trajectory and high-ownership culture are compelling." Accept at $195K+ equity with base above $208K.
