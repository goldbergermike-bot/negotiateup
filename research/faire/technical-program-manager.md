**Negotiation DNA**

Faire Technical Program Managers coordinate complex programs across the B2B wholesale marketplace — marketplace feature launches, payment system upgrades, brand onboarding programs, and international expansion. TPMs at Faire manage programs that span the two-sided marketplace (retailer and brand experiences), financial systems (Net 60 credit processing), and fulfillment coordination. The pre-IPO period adds urgency to program execution — delivering features that drive growth and demonstrate market leadership before IPO. [Source: Faire TPM Comp 2026]
