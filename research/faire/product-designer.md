**Negotiation DNA**

Faire Product Designers shape the B2B wholesale experience for both retailers (discovering and ordering products) and brands (managing their wholesale business). B2B design is fundamentally different from consumer design — your users are business owners making purchasing decisions for their stores, not consumers impulse-buying. The design must be efficient (retailers browse thousands of products), trustworthy (large financial commitments), and informative (detailed product/brand information). Faire has set the design standard for B2B wholesale. [Source: Faire Product Design Comp 2026]
