### Product Designer | Faire Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Startup Comp | Private $12B Valuation | B2B Wholesale Pioneer | Pre-IPO Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco (HQ) | $130K-$182K | $52K-$155K | 10% | $157K-$255K |
| Remote US | $122K-$172K | $48K-$142K | 10% | $148K-$238K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Faire Product Designers shape the B2B wholesale experience for both retailers (discovering and ordering products) and brands (managing their wholesale business). B2B design is fundamentally different from consumer design — your users are business owners making purchasing decisions for their stores, not consumers impulse-buying. The design must be efficient (retailers browse thousands of products), trustworthy (large financial commitments), and informative (detailed product/brand information). Faire has set the design standard for B2B wholesale. [Source: Faire Product Design Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Faire Product Designer = Google UX Designer L3-L4 = Shopify Product Designer = Amazon UX Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **B2B Commerce UX:** "B2B wholesale design requires understanding business buyer behavior — different from consumer UX. My designs must be efficient for professional purchasing."
2. **Two-Sided Platform Design:** "I design for both retailers and brands — two distinct user types with different needs and workflows."
3. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Faire equity has IPO upside. The grant should be $138K+ over 4 years."
4. **Category-Defining Design:** "Faire has set the design standard for B2B wholesale. My design work defines industry patterns."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Faire's B2B design challenges require understanding business buyer behavior for a two-sided marketplace. I'm targeting $142K in equity over 4 years and a base of $178K." Accept at $120K+ equity with base above $168K.
