**Negotiation DNA**

Faire Product Managers define product strategy for the B2B wholesale marketplace — retailer discovery, brand tools, payments (Net 60 terms), fulfillment, and marketplace growth. PMs at Faire must balance two-sided marketplace dynamics: optimizing for both retailer satisfaction (great products, easy ordering, favorable terms) and brand success (distribution, demand visibility, financial reliability). Growth-stage PM work at Faire means defining new product categories, not iterating on established ones. [Source: Faire PM Comp 2026]
