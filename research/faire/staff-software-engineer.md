### Staff Software Engineer | Faire Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Startup Comp | Private $12B Valuation | B2B Wholesale Pioneer | Pre-IPO Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco (HQ) | $190K-$248K | $170K-$380K | 10% | $300K-$480K |
| Remote US | $182K-$238K | $158K-$360K | 10% | $285K-$458K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Faire define the technical strategy for major platform areas — marketplace architecture, payments/credit infrastructure, supply chain intelligence, or data platform. At Staff level, Faire's equity becomes the dominant comp component, and pre-IPO equity at a $12B company with strong growth trajectory carries significant upside potential. Your architectural decisions shape the technology platform that's digitizing B2B wholesale commerce globally. [Source: Faire Staff SWE Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Faire Staff SWE = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Shopify Staff SWE = Amazon Principal SDE

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Staff Equity:** "Staff-level equity in a $12B company with IPO trajectory. The grant should be $340K+ over 4 years to capture the upside."
2. **Platform Architecture Leadership:** "I define the technical strategy for Faire's marketplace platform — architecture that shapes how wholesale commerce works digitally."
3. **Category Creation:** "I'm architecting the technology for a category being created — B2B wholesale marketplace. My decisions define industry standards."
4. **FAANG Alternative:** "My alternative is a Google L5 at $[X] with liquid equity. Faire's pre-IPO upside must compensate for private company risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "At Staff level, I'll define Faire's technical direction during the pre-IPO period. I'm targeting $350K in equity over 4 years and a base of $242K. I have a Google L5 offer at $[X]." Accept at $295K+ equity with base above $228K.
