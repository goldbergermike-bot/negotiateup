**Negotiation DNA**

Faire DevOps Engineers build and maintain the infrastructure powering the B2B wholesale marketplace — marketplace platform, payments processing (including Net 60 credit), order management, and the brand/retailer portals. Faire's infrastructure must handle wholesale ordering patterns (cyclical, seasonal, trade-show-driven) while maintaining the reliability required for financial transactions. The engineering culture is startup-fast with increasing maturity as the company approaches IPO. Pre-IPO equity provides growth upside. [Source: Faire DevOps Comp 2026]
