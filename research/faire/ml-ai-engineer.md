### ML/AI Engineer | Faire Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Startup Comp | Private $12B Valuation | **+5-10% ML PREMIUM** | B2B Wholesale Pioneer | Pre-IPO Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco (HQ) | $155K-$215K | $85K-$228K | 10% | $205K-$338K |
| Remote US | $148K-$205K | $78K-$215K | 10% | $192K-$318K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Faire ML/AI Engineers build machine learning models for product recommendation, search ranking, credit risk assessment, demand forecasting, and marketplace optimization. ML at Faire operates on a unique B2B dataset — wholesale purchasing patterns, retailer profiles, brand performance, and credit behavior. The 5-10% ML premium reflects the scarcity of ML engineers who understand both recommendation systems and B2B credit risk modeling. Faire's ML directly drives marketplace efficiency and financial performance (Net 60 credit default rates). [Source: Faire ML Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Faire ML Engineer = Google ML Engineer L3-L4 = Shopify ML Engineer = Amazon Applied Scientist

**Global Levers**

1. **B2B Marketplace ML:** "ML for a B2B wholesale marketplace is fundamentally different from consumer recommendation — different purchase patterns, relationship dynamics, and risk considerations."
2. **Credit Risk ML Impact:** "My credit models determine Net 60 eligibility and pricing — directly impacting Faire's financial performance."
3. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Faire equity has IPO upside. The grant should be $205K+ over 4 years, reflecting the ML premium."
4. **ML Talent Competition:** "ML engineers in San Francisco have offers from Google, Meta, and top AI labs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Faire's ML challenges span B2B marketplace optimization and credit risk modeling. I'm targeting $210K in equity over 4 years and a base of $210K. I have a Google ML offer at $[X]." Accept at $178K+ equity with base above $200K.
