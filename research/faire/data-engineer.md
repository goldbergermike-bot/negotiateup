Faire Data Engineers build the data infrastructure that powers B2B wholesale analytics — retailer purchasing patterns, brand performance metrics, credit risk signals, and marketplace health indicators. Your pipelines process order data, payment data (including Net 60 credit terms), product catalog data, and retailer profile information. Data engineering at Faire must serve both marketplace optimization (search ranking, recommendations) and financial risk management (credit scoring, default prediction). Pre-IPO equity provides growth upside. [Source: Faire Data Engineering Comp 2026]
