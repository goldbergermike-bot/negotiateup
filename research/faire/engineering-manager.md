### Engineering Manager | Faire Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Startup Comp | Private $12B Valuation | B2B Wholesale Pioneer | Pre-IPO Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco (HQ) | $178K-$235K | $120K-$300K | 10% | $258K-$405K |
| Remote US | $170K-$225K | $112K-$282K | 10% | $245K-$385K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Faire Engineering Managers lead teams building the B2B wholesale marketplace during a critical growth and pre-IPO period. You build engineering teams while establishing the culture and practices that will scale through IPO and beyond. Faire EMs must balance startup velocity with increasing maturity — building teams that can move fast while maintaining the reliability required for financial transactions (Net 60 credit). Pre-IPO equity at EM level is substantial. [Source: Faire EM Comp 2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Team Building:** "I'm building the engineering org that will carry Faire through IPO. This foundational leadership is uniquely valuable."
2. **Pre-IPO EM Equity:** "EM-level equity in a $12B company with IPO trajectory. The grant should be $272K+ over 4 years."
3. **Growth + Maturity Balance:** "Leading engineering at a pre-IPO company requires balancing startup speed with the maturity needed for financial systems."
4. **FAANG EM Alternative:** "I have EM offers from [Google/Meta] at $[X] with liquid equity. Faire's pre-IPO upside must compensate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Leading engineering at Faire during the pre-IPO period is a defining opportunity. I'm targeting $278K in equity over 4 years and a base of $230K. I have a Google EM offer at $[X]." Accept at $235K+ equity with base above $218K.
