**Negotiation DNA**

Faire Engineering Managers lead teams building the B2B wholesale marketplace during a critical growth and pre-IPO period. You build engineering teams while establishing the culture and practices that will scale through IPO and beyond. Faire EMs must balance startup velocity with increasing maturity — building teams that can move fast while maintaining the reliability required for financial transactions (Net 60 credit). Pre-IPO equity at EM level is substantial. [Source: Faire EM Comp 2026]
