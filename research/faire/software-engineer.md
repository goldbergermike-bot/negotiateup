| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Faire Software Engineers build the technology powering the world's largest B2B wholesale marketplace — connecting 100K+ independent retailers with thousands of brands. Faire has disrupted the wholesale industry by bringing e-commerce marketplace dynamics to B2B commerce: product discovery, Net 60 payment terms, free returns, and data-driven recommendations. Compensation is strong for a startup — competitive base, meaningful equity in a $12B company with IPO trajectory, and a 10% target bonus. Faire's San Francisco headquarters and remote-friendly culture provide flexibility. The engineering culture emphasizes high ownership, direct customer impact, and data-driven decision making.
