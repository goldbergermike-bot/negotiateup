**Negotiation DNA**

This is Faire's signature engineering role. Marketplace AI Engineers build the machine learning systems that power Faire's B2B wholesale marketplace — connecting 100K+ independent retailers with thousands of brands. Your AI systems power product discovery (recommending products to retailers based on their store profile and customer demographics), demand forecasting (predicting which products will sell in which stores), risk assessment (Faire's Net 60 terms mean the company takes on significant credit risk), and dynamic pricing/merchandising. The 5-15% marketplace AI premium reflects the rare combination of ML expertise and B2B marketplace domain knowledge — understanding wholesale economics, retailer behavior, and brand dynamics. Faire's $12B private valuation and strong startup compensation mean equity grants carry significant upside potential if the company reaches IPO. San Francisco headquarters and remote-friendly culture give you flexibility. [Source: Faire Marketplace AI Engineering Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Faire Marketplace AI Engineer (Senior) = Google ML Engineer L4-L5 = Shopify ML Engineer = Amazon Applied Scientist II-III

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Marketplace AI Engineer builds the intelligence layer for B2B wholesale:
- **Two-Sided B2B Marketplace:** Your AI must optimize for both retailers (product discovery, inventory planning) and brands (distribution, demand visibility) simultaneously
- **Net 60 Credit Risk ML:** Faire offers retailers Net 60 payment terms, meaning your credit risk models directly impact the company's financial exposure
- **Retailer Recommendation at Scale:** Recommending wholesale products to 100K+ independent retailers based on store profile, location, customer demographics, and seasonal trends
- **Supply Chain Intelligence:** Your models predict demand patterns across the wholesale supply chain, helping brands plan production
- **Strong Startup Culture:** Faire's engineering culture is fast-moving with high ownership and direct access to impact

**Global Levers**

1. **Marketplace AI Premium (5-15%):** "I build AI systems that power both sides of Faire's B2B marketplace — retailer discovery and brand distribution. This requires ML expertise combined with B2B wholesale domain knowledge, a rare combination that commands a premium."
2. **Credit Risk ML Impact:** "Faire's Net 60 terms mean my credit risk models directly determine the company's financial exposure. A 1% improvement in default prediction saves millions in losses."
3. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Faire at $12B valuation has significant IPO upside. My equity grant should be sized to capture this growth: $230K+ over 4 years."
4. **Two-Sided Marketplace ML:** "Optimizing a two-sided B2B marketplace requires models that balance retailer satisfaction with brand economics — a multi-objective optimization challenge that exceeds typical consumer recommendation systems."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Faire's marketplace AI powers the intelligence layer for B2B wholesale — retailer discovery, credit risk, and demand forecasting. I'm bringing [specific ML/marketplace/B2B expertise] that directly improves marketplace efficiency and credit performance. I'm targeting $235K in equity over 4 years with the Marketplace AI Premium, plus a base of $220K. I have a [Google/Shopify] ML offer at $[X]. Faire's B2B marketplace position and pre-IPO trajectory are compelling, but the equity must reflect the marketplace AI premium." Accept at $200K+ equity.
