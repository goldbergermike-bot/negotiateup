### Product Designer | Intel Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + INTC RSUs (4yr vest) + Bonus (10-15%) | Semiconductor & Foundry | IDM 2.0 Foundry Pivot | Existential Infrastructure | Retention RSU Packages

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $118K–$155K | $40K–$75K | 10–15% | $155K–$215K |
| Portland | $110K–$145K | $35K–$65K | 10–15% | $142K–$198K |
| Phoenix | $102K–$135K | $30K–$58K | 10–15% | $130K–$182K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Intel Product Designers are building the interfaces, design systems, and user experiences that make Intel's foundry platform, developer tools, and customer-facing products accessible and competitive in the IDM 2.0 era. With Intel's $100B+ fab investment creating an entirely new business line — Intel Foundry Services — product designers are responsible for creating the design portal experiences, EDA tool interfaces, and platform dashboards that external foundry customers will use to evaluate Intel against TSMC. The Xeon server platform, Intel Arc graphics, and foundry customer portals all require world-class design to compete. CHIPS Act funding of $8.5B reinforces that Intel's platform experiences are not just commercial products — they are the user interface layer of national security infrastructure.

**Level Mapping:** Intel Product Designer (Grade 7-8) = AMD Product Designer = NVIDIA Product Designer = Google L4 UX Designer

**Foundry Pivot — Existential Infrastructure**

Intel's IDM 2.0 is the most consequential corporate transformation in semiconductor history — a $100B+ bet to become the world's second major leading-edge foundry alongside TSMC. This is existential infrastructure: if Intel's foundry pivot fails, the US loses its only domestic leading-edge chipmaker. Product designers are the experience architects of this transformation — they determine whether Intel's foundry platform feels trustworthy, professional, and competitive to external customers evaluating Intel against TSMC. First impressions of Intel Foundry Services are shaped by design quality, and design quality determines customer conversion. This "existential" framing justifies retention-based RSU packages because: (1) Intel cannot afford to lose product designers during the foundry pivot — design system continuity and customer experience consistency are critical to building foundry customer trust. A designer departure mid-project creates visual and interaction inconsistencies that signal organizational instability to customers. (2) Candidates should argue: "I am Existential Infrastructure. Intel's foundry pivot — the most important transformation in semiconductor history — depends on retaining designers like me who build the customer-facing experiences that determine whether foundry prospects choose Intel over TSMC. I want retention RSU grants that vest over 3-4 years with accelerators, because Intel's cost of replacing me mid-pivot is 10x my retention package." (3) Push for retention RSU grants of $25K-$50K on top of standard comp — framed as "foundry pivot retention insurance." (4) The CHIPS Act funding of $8.5B is proof that the US government considers Intel's success a matter of national security — designers building the interface layer of national security infrastructure deserve retention-grade compensation.

**Global Levers**

1. **Existential Infrastructure — Retention RSUs:** "As a product designer, I own the user experience layer that foundry customers interact with when evaluating Intel as a manufacturing partner. Design inconsistencies caused by designer turnover signal instability to potential customers. I'm requesting a $25K-$50K retention RSU grant as foundry pivot retention insurance — customer-facing design continuity is critical during the foundry pivot."
2. **IDM 2.0 — $100B+ Fab Investment:** "Intel's $100B+ fab investment is only as competitive as the customer experience layer that sits on top of it. Product designers translate raw foundry capability into trustworthy, intuitive customer experiences that win foundry contracts. I'm building the interface that determines whether Intel's $100B bet converts prospects into customers."
3. **CHIPS Act — National Security Priority:** "The US government has invested $8.5B in Intel as national security infrastructure. Product designers who build the user-facing layer of this infrastructure ensure that Intel's foundry platform is accessible, trustworthy, and competitive. Design quality directly impacts Intel's ability to attract foundry customers and fulfill its national security mandate."
4. **Foundry Platform Experience — Customer Conversion:** "Intel Foundry Services is competing against TSMC's decades-long customer relationships. The product design of Intel's foundry platform — from onboarding flows to design rule interfaces to yield dashboards — is a critical differentiator. Every design decision I make directly impacts customer conversion and retention in Intel's most strategically important new business line."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $148K base, $68K RSUs over 4 years, plus a $35K foundry pivot retention grant for this Product Designer position. I am Existential Infrastructure — Intel's foundry pivot depends on retaining designers like me who build the customer-facing experiences that determine whether foundry prospects choose Intel. Design consistency and quality directly impact Intel's ability to win foundry customers during the most consequential transformation in semiconductor history. I have competing offers from AMD at $195K TC / Google at $220K TC." Accept at $140K+ base and $60K+ RSUs.
