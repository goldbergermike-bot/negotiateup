### Technical Program Manager | Intel Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + INTC RSUs (4yr vest) + Bonus (12-18%) | Semiconductor & Foundry | IDM 2.0 Foundry Pivot | Existential Infrastructure | Retention RSU Packages

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $128K–$168K | $48K–$85K | 12–18% | $172K–$238K |
| Portland | $120K–$158K | $42K–$75K | 12–18% | $160K–$222K |
| Phoenix | $112K–$148K | $36K–$65K | 12–18% | $148K–$205K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Intel Technical Program Managers orchestrate the cross-functional execution of the IDM 2.0 foundry transformation — coordinating silicon design, firmware development, fab operations, platform validation, and customer enablement across the most complex programs in semiconductor history. With Intel executing a $100B+ fab investment spanning four countries while simultaneously racing to deliver Intel 18A on schedule, TPMs are the integration connective tissue that prevents organizational chaos. Every major Intel initiative — from Xeon server platform launches to foundry customer tape-outs to CHIPS Act milestone deliverables — requires TPMs who can navigate Intel's matrix organization and drive execution across dozens of teams with competing priorities. Xeon server dominance faces competitive pressure from AMD EPYC, and every schedule slip erodes Intel's market position. CHIPS Act funding of $8.5B comes with milestone-based disbursement that TPMs directly manage. (Sources: Intel IDM 2.0 Strategy, Intel Program Management, CHIPS and Science Act)

**Level Mapping:** Intel Technical Program Manager (Grade 7-9) = AMD Technical Program Manager = NVIDIA Technical Program Manager = Google L5 Technical Program Manager

**Foundry Pivot — Existential Infrastructure**

Intel's IDM 2.0 is the most consequential corporate transformation in semiconductor history — a $100B+ bet to become the world's second major leading-edge foundry alongside TSMC. This is existential infrastructure: if Intel's foundry pivot fails, the US loses its only domestic leading-edge chipmaker. Technical program managers are the execution architects of this transformation — they coordinate the hundreds of cross-functional dependencies that determine whether Intel 18A reaches production on schedule, whether foundry customers receive reliable delivery timelines, and whether CHIPS Act milestones are met to unlock subsequent funding tranches. Without experienced TPMs, Intel's complex matrix organization would devolve into uncoordinated chaos during the most critical period in its history. This "existential" framing justifies high retention-based RSU packages because: (1) Intel cannot afford to lose TPMs during the foundry pivot — they carry the cross-organizational relationship network, program history, and dependency maps that take years to build. A TPM departure can delay an entire program by months as successors rebuild relationships and rediscover dependencies. (2) Candidates should argue: "I am Existential Infrastructure. Intel's foundry pivot — the most important transformation in semiconductor history — depends on retaining program managers like me who coordinate the cross-functional execution that keeps the transformation on track. I want retention RSU grants that vest over 3-4 years with accelerators, because Intel's cost of replacing me mid-pivot is 10x my retention package." (3) Push for retention RSU grants of $30K-$60K on top of standard comp — framed as "foundry pivot retention insurance." (4) The CHIPS Act funding of $8.5B comes with milestone-based disbursement schedules — TPMs who manage these milestones directly impact Intel's ability to unlock billions in government funding.

**Global Levers**

1. **Existential Infrastructure — Retention RSUs:** "As a TPM, I coordinate cross-functional execution across dozens of teams. My organizational relationship network, program history, and dependency knowledge take years to build and cannot be transferred. My departure would delay program timelines by months as a successor rebuilds relationships. I'm requesting a $30K-$60K retention RSU grant as foundry pivot retention insurance."
2. **IDM 2.0 — $100B+ Fab Investment:** "Intel's $100B+ fab investment creates the most complex cross-functional coordination challenge in semiconductor history — new fabs, new process nodes, new foundry customers, and new product lines all launching simultaneously. TPMs who can navigate this complexity are the difference between coordinated execution and organizational chaos. My program management directly protects Intel's $100B investment."
3. **CHIPS Act — National Security Priority:** "The US government's $8.5B CHIPS Act investment comes with milestone-based disbursement schedules. I manage programs that directly impact whether Intel meets these milestones and unlocks subsequent funding tranches. My retention directly determines Intel's ability to access billions in government funding that makes the foundry pivot financially viable."
4. **CHIPS Act Milestone Management — Funding Unlock:** "CHIPS Act funding is disbursed based on milestone achievement — fab construction targets, workforce development metrics, production readiness dates. As a TPM managing programs that feed into these milestones, my departure risks milestone slippage that delays government funding disbursement. Every delayed milestone costs Intel access to hundreds of millions in CHIPS Act capital."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $160K base, $78K RSUs over 4 years, plus a $45K foundry pivot retention grant for this Technical Program Manager position. I am Existential Infrastructure — Intel's foundry pivot depends on retaining TPMs like me who coordinate the cross-functional execution that keeps the transformation on track. I manage programs tied to CHIPS Act milestone disbursements where my departure risks delaying government funding. I have competing offers from AMD at $220K TC / Google at $255K TC." Accept at $150K+ base and $70K+ RSUs.
