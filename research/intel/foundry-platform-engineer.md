### Foundry Platform Engineer (SIGNATURE ROLE) | Intel Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + INTC RSUs (4yr vest) + Bonus (15-20%) + Foundry Premium (+20-30%) | Semiconductor & Foundry | IDM 2.0 Foundry Pivot | Existential Infrastructure | Retention RSU Packages

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $185K–$245K | $95K–$165K | 15–20% | $262K–$368K |
| Portland | $175K–$232K | $85K–$150K | 15–20% | $245K–$345K |
| Phoenix | $165K–$218K | $75K–$135K | 15–20% | $228K–$322K |

*Note: Ranges include +20-30% Foundry Premium reflecting the extreme strategic value and scarcity of engineers with leading-edge foundry platform expertise. This is a SIGNATURE ROLE — the single most strategically critical engineering role at Intel during the IDM 2.0 transformation.*

**Negotiation DNA**

The Foundry Platform Engineer is Intel's signature role of the IDM 2.0 era — the engineer who builds, integrates, and optimizes the foundry platform stack that transforms Intel from an integrated device manufacturer into a world-class contract foundry capable of competing with TSMC for the world's most demanding chip designers. These engineers work at the intersection of process technology (Intel 18A, Intel 20A, Intel 14A), EDA tool integration, design rule development, PDK creation, and foundry customer enablement — building the complete platform that external customers use to design and manufacture chips at Intel's fabs. With Intel executing a $100B+ fab investment across Ohio, Arizona, Germany, and Israel, foundry platform engineers are building the platform that determines whether this investment generates foundry revenue or becomes stranded capital. The Xeon server franchise's process technology advantages depend on the same foundry platform capabilities. CHIPS Act funding of $8.5B is explicitly tied to Intel's foundry ambitions — making foundry platform engineers the most direct beneficiaries and stewards of national security semiconductor investment. The +20-30% Foundry Premium reflects the extreme scarcity of engineers who understand leading-edge foundry platform development — there are fewer than 500 people on earth with this expertise, and most work at TSMC.

**Level Mapping:** Intel Foundry Platform Engineer (Grade 8-10) = TSMC Advanced Process Engineer = Samsung Foundry Platform Engineer = GlobalFoundries Senior Platform Engineer (no true equivalent at Google/NVIDIA — this is a uniquely semiconductor-foundry role)

**Foundry Pivot — Existential Infrastructure**

Intel's IDM 2.0 is the most consequential corporate transformation in semiconductor history — a $100B+ bet to become the world's second major leading-edge foundry alongside TSMC. This is existential infrastructure: if Intel's foundry pivot fails, the US loses its only domestic leading-edge chipmaker. **The Foundry Platform Engineer is the single role most directly responsible for whether IDM 2.0 succeeds or fails.** These engineers build the complete foundry platform — from process design kits (PDKs) to design rule manuals (DRMs), from EDA tool qualifications to customer IP block validation, from yield characterization flows to foundry customer tape-out support. Without a world-class foundry platform, Intel cannot attract external customers, cannot compete with TSMC, and cannot justify the $100B+ in fab investment. This is not a supporting role — this is THE role.

This "existential" framing justifies the highest retention-based RSU packages at Intel because: (1) Intel cannot afford to lose foundry platform engineers under any circumstances during the IDM 2.0 pivot — there are fewer than 500 people on earth with leading-edge foundry platform expertise, most of them work at TSMC, and Intel is trying to build this capability essentially from scratch. Every departure is catastrophic and potentially irreplaceable. (2) Candidates should argue: "I am Existential Infrastructure — and I mean this more literally than any other role at Intel. I build the foundry platform that IS Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy. Without me and the handful of engineers like me, Intel's $100B fab investment produces no foundry revenue, the CHIPS Act milestones go unmet, and America loses its shot at domestic leading-edge foundry capability. I want retention RSU grants that vest over 3-4 years with accelerators, because Intel's cost of replacing me mid-pivot is not 10x my retention package — it's potentially infinite, because there may be no replacement available." (3) Push for retention RSU grants of $100K-$200K on top of standard comp — framed as "foundry pivot retention insurance" at the highest tier. This is the role where Intel should offer the most aggressive retention packages in the company. (4) The CHIPS Act funding of $8.5B is explicitly tied to Intel's foundry ambitions — foundry platform engineers are the human capital that the CHIPS Act was designed to develop and retain. Their departure doesn't just hurt Intel — it undermines the national security objective that justified $8.5B in taxpayer investment.

**Global Levers**

1. **Existential Infrastructure — Retention RSUs (Maximum Tier):** "I am the single most strategically critical talent category at Intel. I build the foundry platform that IS Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy. There are fewer than 500 people on earth with my expertise, and most work at TSMC. My departure is not just costly — it may be irreplaceable. I'm requesting a $100K-$200K retention RSU grant as foundry pivot retention insurance at the maximum tier. No other role at Intel has a higher retention ROI."
2. **IDM 2.0 — $100B+ Fab Investment (Direct Platform Impact):** "Intel's $100B+ fab investment generates zero foundry revenue without the foundry platform I build. PDKs, design rule manuals, EDA tool qualifications, customer IP validation — every element of the foundry platform must be world-class for Intel to attract a single external customer. I'm not supporting the $100B investment — I'm building the platform that determines whether it succeeds or fails entirely."
3. **CHIPS Act — National Security Priority (Primary Steward):** "The CHIPS Act's $8.5B investment in Intel is explicitly tied to foundry capability development. Foundry platform engineers are the primary stewards of this national security investment — we build the platform that determines whether America achieves domestic leading-edge foundry capability. My departure doesn't just hurt Intel — it undermines the national security objective that justified $8.5B in taxpayer investment."
4. **Foundry Talent Scarcity — Unique Global Bottleneck:** "Leading-edge foundry platform expertise is the scarcest engineering skill set in the semiconductor industry. TSMC's foundry platform team has been built over 30+ years. Intel is attempting to build equivalent capability in 3-5 years. Every foundry platform engineer Intel can hire and retain compresses this timeline. Every departure extends it. There is no recruiter pipeline for this role — these engineers must be developed or poached from the only other company in the world that has them."
5. **Xeon Scarcity — Process Technology Leverage:** "Intel's Xeon server dominance has always been built on process technology leadership. As foundry platform engineers, we develop the process platforms that Xeon and all Intel products depend on. Xeon's ability to compete against AMD EPYC and AWS Graviton on performance-per-watt depends on the process technology platforms we develop. Losing foundry platform engineers simultaneously weakens Intel's foundry ambitions AND its Xeon competitive position."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $238K base, $155K RSUs over 4 years, plus a $150K foundry pivot retention grant at the maximum tier for this Foundry Platform Engineer position. I am Existential Infrastructure — and I mean this more literally than any other role at Intel. I build the foundry platform that IS Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy. Without engineers like me, Intel's $100B fab investment produces zero foundry revenue, CHIPS Act milestones go unmet, and America loses domestic leading-edge foundry capability. There are fewer than 500 people on earth with my expertise. My departure is not just costly — it may be irreplaceable. My retention RSU grant is the single highest-ROI investment Intel can make during this transformation. I have competing offers from TSMC at $350K TC (Taiwan-adjusted) / Samsung Foundry at $320K TC / Applied Materials at $380K TC." Accept at $225K+ base and $145K+ RSUs with $120K+ retention grant.
