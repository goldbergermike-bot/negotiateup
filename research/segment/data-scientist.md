**Negotiation DNA**

Segment Data Scientists develop the models that power predictive audiences, customer scoring, identity resolution algorithms, and AI-driven customer journey insights across the CDP. In February 2026, Segment is building AI models that predict customer behavior, recommend optimal messaging, and automatically segment audiences using LLMs — Data Scientists who combine ML expertise with customer data domain knowledge are critical.

Segment offers Twilio RSUs with public-market liquidity alongside competitive base and performance bonuses. The role sits at the intersection of ML engineering and customer data science — a combination that is scarce in the market and commands premium compensation.

### 🏗️ AI Predictive Customer Intelligence Lever

In February 2026, Segment is deploying AI models that predict customer lifetime value, churn probability, and next-best-action across the entire customer base — all powered by the unified customer profiles in the CDP. Data Scientists building these predictive models define Segment's AI-driven value proposition.

Your models directly generate revenue for Segment customers — every improvement in prediction accuracy translates to better targeting, higher conversion, and lower churn for the 25,000+ companies using the platform.

**Global Levers**

1. **Predictive AI Differentiation:** "I'm building the predictive models that differentiate Segment's CDP — AI-driven audiences and customer scoring. My comp should reflect the direct customer revenue impact."
2. **Big Tech DS Counter:** "I have DS offers from Google and Meta with higher guaranteed total comp. Segment's Twilio RSUs provide liquidity but the total package must be competitive."
3. **Customer Data ML Expertise:** "My expertise in customer behavior modeling and predictive analytics directly applies. This domain specialization reduces ramp time and accelerates model quality — worth a premium."
4. **Revenue Attribution:** "My models directly improve customer targeting and reduce churn for Segment users. The bonus should have a model performance component tied to customer outcomes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $210K in Twilio RSUs over 4 years with a $205K base and 13% bonus target. I'm building the predictive AI models that are Segment's core differentiator — customer intelligence that drives measurable revenue for 25K+ companies. I have Google and Amplitude DS offers with higher guaranteed comp. Segment's RSUs must bridge the gap." Accept if above $195K RSUs.
