Segment Engineering Managers lead the teams building the world's leading Customer Data Platform — managing engineers across event ingestion, identity resolution, integrations, and AI-powered customer intelligence features. In February 2026, EMs are critical to Segment's AI transformation within Twilio, orchestrating teams that integrate LLMs and predictive models into the CDP while maintaining the reliability and scale customers depend on.

As part of Twilio, Segment EMs receive premium RSU grants with public-market liquidity alongside leadership bonuses. EMs who can lead both traditional platform engineering and AI/ML teams while navigating the dynamics of a business unit within a larger enterprise have unique value.

### 🏗️ AI CDP Team Orchestration Lever

In February 2026, Segment is building dedicated AI teams within its engineering organization — requiring EMs who can recruit ML talent, define AI-focused sprint processes, and align cross-functional stakeholders on AI feature delivery. Engineering Managers who can operate effectively within Twilio's organizational structure while maintaining startup-speed execution on AI features are rare.

Your leadership directly determines team velocity, talent retention, and the successful execution of Segment's AI roadmap. Every hire you make and every sprint you run compounds the team's ability to ship AI-powered CDP features ahead of competitors.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Team Leadership:** "I'm leading the team building Segment's AI-powered CDP features — the core strategic bet. My RSU grant and bonus should reflect the team's strategic importance to Twilio."
2. **Big Tech EM Counter:** "I have EM offers from Google and Meta at $400K+ total comp. Segment's Twilio RSUs must bridge the guaranteed comp gap with a premium grant reflecting AI leadership."

4. **Talent Magnet Premium:** "My network and reputation attract top engineering talent. At Segment's growth stage, my ability to recruit AI engineers directly accelerates the roadmap — worth a premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $290K in Twilio RSUs over 4 years with a $245K base and 18% bonus target. I'm leading the AI engineering team for Segment — the most strategic initiative within Twilio's product portfolio. I have EM offers from Google and Databricks at $410K+ guaranteed. Segment's RSU package must make this leadership role compelling." Accept if above $270K RSUs.
