**Global Levers**

1. **AI CDP Infrastructure:** "I'm building the data infrastructure that powers Segment's AI-driven CDP — real-time event processing for predictive audiences and identity resolution. My equity should reflect the AI transformation value."
2. **Snowflake/Databricks Counter:** "I have offers from Snowflake and Databricks with larger equity grants. Segment's Twilio RSUs provide liquidity but the grant size must be competitive."
3. **Scale Expertise Premium:** "Processing billions of events daily across 400+ integrations requires specialized distributed systems expertise. My experience directly accelerates Segment's AI infrastructure scaling."
4. **CDP Market Growth:** "The CDP market is projected to reach $15B+ by 2028 with AI features driving adoption. I'm joining at the AI inflection — my equity should reflect this growth trajectory."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $195K in Twilio RSUs over 4 years with a $198K base and 12% bonus target. I'm building the AI-powered CDP infrastructure — the foundation for Segment's next growth phase. I have Snowflake and Databricks offers with larger equity packages. Segment's RSU grant must be competitive for the AI infrastructure complexity." Accept if above $180K RSUs.
