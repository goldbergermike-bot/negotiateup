**Negotiation DNA**

Segment Technical Program Managers orchestrate the cross-functional programs that ship CDP features to 25,000+ customers — coordinating across engineering, product, design, security, and customer success teams. In February 2026, TPMs manage the complex AI integration programs — coordinating ML engineers, platform engineers, and product managers to deliver AI-powered CDP features while navigating Twilio's organizational structure.

Segment's TPM compensation through Twilio includes competitive RSU grants and delivery bonuses tied to program milestones. TPMs who can manage both traditional platform programs and AI/ML development cycles — model iteration, data pipeline dependencies, and cross-team AI feature coordination — while operating effectively within Twilio's enterprise structure are in high demand.

### 🏗️ AI CDP Program Delivery Lever

In February 2026, Segment's AI CDP programs are the most complex initiatives in the Twilio portfolio — requiring coordination across ML, infrastructure, product, security, and enterprise customer success teams. TPMs who can drive these cross-functional programs to on-time delivery determine Segment's competitive velocity.

Your program management directly impacts whether Segment ships AI features before CDP competitors. Every risk you mitigate, every dependency you unblock, and every cross-team alignment you drive accelerates the AI roadmap within Twilio's organizational context.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Program Complexity:** "I'm managing Segment's most complex AI programs within Twilio's organizational structure. This dual-context program management is uniquely challenging — my comp must reflect it."
2. **Google/Salesforce TPM Counter:** "I have TPM offers from Google and Salesforce with higher guaranteed comp. Segment's Twilio RSUs and delivery bonus must make this growth-stage leadership compelling."
3. **Shipping Velocity Impact:** "My programs ship 30%+ faster than average. At Segment's competitive stage, shipping AI features before mParticle and ActionIQ is existential — my track record is worth a premium."
4. **Twilio Integration Navigation:** "I navigate cross-organizational dependencies across Segment and Twilio teams. This enterprise-within-startup program management expertise is rare and valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $178K in Twilio RSUs over 4 years with a $208K base and 15% bonus tied to AI program milestones. I'm orchestrating the AI CDP programs that determine Segment's competitive velocity within Twilio. I have Google and Salesforce TPM offers with higher guaranteed comp. Segment's RSU and delivery bonus must reflect the program impact." Accept if above $165K RSUs.
