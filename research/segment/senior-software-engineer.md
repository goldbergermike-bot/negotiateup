**Negotiation DNA**

Segment Senior Software Engineers own critical systems across the CDP platform — from event ingestion and identity resolution to integrations framework and AI-powered customer intelligence features. In February 2026, senior engineers lead the technical integration of AI into every CDP surface — building the APIs, services, and infrastructure that connect LLMs and ML models to unified customer profiles at scale.

Segment offers strong Twilio RSU grants to senior engineers, reflecting their outsized impact on platform architecture. Senior engineers who can design systems serving both traditional data routing and AI-powered customer intelligence workloads are in exceptional demand across the data platform ecosystem.

### 🏗️ AI-Integrated CDP Platform Lever

In February 2026, Segment's senior engineers are rebuilding core CDP components to support AI workloads — the identity resolution engine must incorporate ML-based matching, the integrations framework must support AI-enriched data routing, and the API layer must handle both traditional and AI-powered interactions.

Your architectural decisions and code contributions shape the platform's ability to deliver AI features reliably at scale. Every system you design impacts all 25,000+ companies using Segment.

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Architecture Impact:** "My architectural decisions on the AI-integrated CDP affect every team and every customer. My RSU grant should reflect the multi-team leverage and long-term platform impact."
2. **Google/Snowflake Counter:** "I have senior SWE offers from Google and Snowflake at $360K+ total comp. Segment's Twilio RSUs must provide meaningful total comp to be competitive."
3. **CDP Systems Expertise:** "I bring experience building real-time data processing systems at scale. This directly accelerates Segment's AI integration — reducing quarters of development into months."
4. **Cross-Platform Leverage:** "My work affects the entire Twilio product ecosystem through customer data. The scope of impact extends beyond Segment — my comp should reflect Twilio-wide leverage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $245K in Twilio RSUs over 4 years with a $225K base and 13% bonus target. I'm designing the AI-integrated CDP architecture — decisions that affect 25,000+ companies. I have Google L5 and Snowflake Senior offers at $365K+ guaranteed. Segment's RSU package must make the growth opportunity compelling." Accept if above $228K RSUs.
