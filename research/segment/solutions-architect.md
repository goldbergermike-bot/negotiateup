Segment Solutions Architects design enterprise CDP implementations — architecting customer data collection strategies, configuring integrations across complex tech stacks, and ensuring successful deployments for the largest companies. In February 2026, SAs are increasingly responsible for helping enterprise customers adopt AI-powered CDP features — configuring predictive audiences, setting up AI-driven identity resolution, and designing data architectures that maximize AI insight quality.

Segment's SA compensation through Twilio leans toward higher base salaries with performance bonuses tied to customer success and expansion metrics. Solutions Architects with enterprise data architecture experience and the ability to articulate AI CDP value propositions are essential to enterprise deal velocity.
