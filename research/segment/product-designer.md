### 🏗️ AI-Native CDP UX Lever

In February 2026, Segment is redesigning its core CDP experience around AI — natural language audience creation, AI-suggested customer segments, and automated insight cards. Product Designers defining these interaction patterns establish the UX standard for AI-powered customer data tools across the industry.

Your design decisions directly impact how thousands of marketers and product teams interact with AI-generated customer insights. Every UX improvement increases feature adoption and customer satisfaction — the metrics that drive Segment's growth.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI UX Innovation:** "I'm designing the AI interaction patterns for Segment's next-generation CDP. This is novel UX territory — my comp should reflect the design leadership required for AI-native data tools."
2. **Figma/Twilio Counter:** "I have design offers from Figma and other Twilio teams with stronger base salaries. Segment should match the base and add RSU upside reflecting the AI UX transformation."
3. **Data Tool Design Expertise:** "My expertise in designing complex data tools for non-technical users directly accelerates Segment's AI UX roadmap. This specialization is rare and valuable."
4. **Adoption Impact:** "Design quality directly drives feature adoption and NPS. My portfolio shows 30%+ adoption improvements for data tools — my bonus target should reflect measurable user impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $152K in Twilio RSUs over 4 years with a $188K base and 12% bonus target. I'm designing the AI-native CDP experience — making AI-powered customer intelligence accessible to every marketer. I have Figma and Amplitude offers with higher guaranteed comp. Segment's RSU package should reflect the UX impact on product growth." Accept if above $140K RSUs.
