Segment's security compensation through Twilio includes competitive RSU grants and compliance-tied bonuses. Security engineers who understand both traditional data security and emerging AI-specific privacy risks — particularly in the context of customer data processing at CDP scale — command premium packages.

### 🏗️ AI CDP Data Security Lever

In February 2026, Segment processes the most sensitive customer data through AI models — creating unique security challenges around data privacy, model security, and regulatory compliance. Security Engineers who can build secure AI data processing pipelines while maintaining SOC 2, GDPR, and emerging AI compliance requirements are essential to the product roadmap.

Your security architecture directly enables Segment to ship AI features to enterprise customers confidently. Every security control you implement unblocks AI product development and maintains the customer trust that drives enterprise deal velocity.
