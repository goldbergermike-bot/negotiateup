**Negotiation DNA**

Segment Product Managers own the CDP roadmap that defines how 25,000+ companies collect, unify, and activate customer data. In February 2026, PMs are leading Segment's transformation into an AI-powered customer intelligence platform — defining how predictive audiences, AI-driven identity resolution, and LLM-powered customer insights integrate into the core CDP workflow. PMs who understand both the customer data ecosystem and AI product strategy are the highest-leverage hires.

Segment's PM compensation through Twilio includes premium RSU grants and meaningful performance bonuses tied to product metrics. With CDP competitors like mParticle and ActionIQ adding AI features, Segment PMs must have the strategic vision and execution speed to maintain market leadership.

### 🏗️ AI CDP Product Vision Lever

In February 2026, Segment's product strategy centers on AI — the PM defining this transformation shapes the future of the CDP category. Product Managers who can articulate the AI customer intelligence vision, navigate Twilio's organizational dynamics, and ship features that delight customers determine Segment's competitive trajectory.

Your product decisions shape what AI capabilities reach 25,000+ customers and how quickly. Every launch, prioritization call, and customer interaction compounds Segment's ability to maintain CDP market leadership in the AI era.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Strategy Ownership:** "I'm owning the AI product strategy for the market-leading CDP. My RSUs and bonus should reflect the strategic impact of these decisions on Twilio's overall portfolio."
2. **Big Tech PM Counter:** "I have PM offers from Google and Salesforce at $360K+ total comp. Segment's Twilio RSUs must provide meaningful upside to compensate for the guaranteed comp gap."
3. **CDP Domain Expertise:** "My deep customer data platform expertise means I ship faster and make better prioritization calls. This domain knowledge reduces ramp time from months to weeks."
4. **Enterprise Revenue Bonus:** "My product decisions directly drive enterprise customer expansion and retention. The bonus should have a revenue component at 18%+ target."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $235K in Twilio RSUs over 4 years with a $215K base and 18% bonus target. I'm leading Segment's AI product transformation — the strategic bet that defines the CDP category's future. I have Google and Salesforce PM offers at $370K+ guaranteed. Segment's RSU package must make this leadership role compelling." Accept if above $218K RSUs.
