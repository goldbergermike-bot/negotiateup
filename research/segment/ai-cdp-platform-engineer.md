### AI CDP Platform Engineer | Segment Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Top-Tier Twilio RSU + Signing Bonus | AI-Native Customer Data Platform Core 2026

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $192K–$235K | $155K–$290K | 10–15% | $275K–$378K |
| New York | $188K–$228K | $148K–$278K | 10–15% | $265K–$365K |

**Negotiation DNA**

The AI CDP Platform Engineer is Segment's signature hybrid role — sitting at the intersection of AI/ML engineering and customer data platform architecture. In February 2026, this role builds the AI systems that power Segment's next-generation CDP capabilities: ML-based identity resolution that unifies customer profiles across devices and channels, predictive audience models that anticipate customer behavior, and LLM-powered data enrichment that transforms raw events into actionable customer intelligence. This requires deep understanding of both AI systems engineering and customer data domain patterns.

Segment offers top-tier Twilio RSUs and signing bonuses for this role, recognizing that the combination of AI engineering skills and CDP domain expertise is exceptionally rare. Candidates with this intersection skillset have extraordinary leverage — there are fewer than a few hundred engineers globally who truly excel at both.

### 🏗️ AI-Native CDP Intelligence Core Lever

In February 2026, the AI CDP Platform Engineer role represents the most strategically important technical position at Segment. These engineers are building the AI systems that transform Segment from a data routing platform into an intelligent customer data engine — where every event is enriched by AI, every identity is resolved by ML, and every audience is predicted by sophisticated models.

Your work defines the AI intelligence layer that 25,000+ companies experience when they use Segment. Every model improvement, every identity resolution enhancement, and every predictive audience refinement directly improves customer outcomes — and directly determines whether Segment maintains CDP market leadership in the AI era.

**Global Levers**

1. **Intersection Scarcity Premium:** "The intersection of AI/ML engineering and CDP platform expertise is the rarest skillset in the data industry. I bring both — my comp must reflect this scarcity, not generic ML or platform benchmarks."
2. **CDP Market Leadership:** "The AI capabilities I build determine whether Segment maintains CDP market leadership. This isn't supplementary — it's the competitive survival strategy. My RSUs must reflect existential importance."
3. **AI Lab/Big Tech Counter:** "I have offers from AI labs at $420K+ and big tech ML teams at $400K+. Segment's Twilio RSUs provide liquidity but the total package must make the growth bet rational."
4. **Signing Bonus Expectation:** "Given the AI talent market and my transition from guaranteed big tech comp, I expect a $55K-$75K signing bonus as standard for this hybrid role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $282K in Twilio RSUs over 4 years with a $232K base, 13% bonus, and $65K signing bonus. I'm building the AI intelligence core that transforms Segment's CDP — determining market leadership for 25K+ customers. I have AI lab offers at $430K+ and Google ML at $405K+. Segment's RSU package must make this bet mathematically compelling." Accept if above $265K RSUs.
