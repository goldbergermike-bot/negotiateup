**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at FIS are building the intelligence layer that differentiates the company's Pure-Play FinTech platform from commodity payment processing. Following the $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026, FIS is investing aggressively in machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities across three critical domains: real-time fraud detection for the Total Issuing platform, intelligent transaction routing and authorization optimization, and AI-powered customer analytics for FIS's banking clients. These are not research projects — they are production ML systems that process billions of financial transactions and directly impact FIS's revenue and its clients' risk exposure.

The Pure-Play FinTech transformation fundamentally changes FIS's AI strategy. Without the Worldpay merchant acquiring business, FIS's ML models can now be exclusively optimized for banking and issuing use cases — card-not-present fraud detection, synthetic identity fraud prevention, real-time credit decisioning, and transaction anomaly detection. This focus enables the kind of deep, domain-specific ML expertise that produces genuinely differentiated products. With $500M in incremental cash flow available post-divestiture, FIS is building out dedicated ML engineering teams, investing in ML infrastructure (feature stores, model serving platforms, experiment tracking), and recruiting ML engineers who can bridge the gap between research and production.

FIS's $13.5B acquisition history brought in diverse ML capabilities — SunGard's quantitative models for capital markets, various fraud detection systems from acquired processors, and legacy rule-based systems that predate modern ML. The ML/AI Engineer who can evaluate this inherited model portfolio, identify what should be retrained, what should be rebuilt, and what should be replaced with modern approaches is creating enormous value during a period of rapid platform consolidation.

### Total Issuing — The Pure-Play FinTech Premium

**Lever 1 — AI-Powered Total Issuing Differentiation:** "The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 means FIS's competitive differentiation in the Pure-Play FinTech market depends on the intelligence of its platform — not just the plumbing. Total Issuing needs AI-powered fraud detection, dynamic authorization rules, and real-time risk scoring that outperforms competitors like Marqeta and Stripe Issuing. As the ML/AI Engineer building these capabilities, I'm creating the features that justify premium pricing for Total Issuing. I'd like my compensation to reflect this: $230,000-$235,000 base in New York with an RSU grant of $220,000-$240,000 over four years."

**Lever 2 — Pure-Play FinTech ML Talent Competition:** "Post-Worldpay, FIS competes for ML/AI talent against Stripe's ML team, Google's payments ML group, and JPMorgan's massive AI investment. As a Pure-Play FinTech company, FIS must offer ML engineer compensation that is competitive with these peers — not with legacy enterprise IT rates. I'm looking for total comp in the $450,000-$520,000 range in New York, which is where the market sits for experienced ML engineers with financial services domain expertise."

**Lever 3 — $500M AI/ML Infrastructure Investment:** "FIS has $500M in incremental cash flow to invest post-divestiture, and AI/ML capabilities are a critical component of the Total Issuing platform roadmap. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect the scale of this investment — $180,000-$240,000 over four years — and I'd also like to discuss a dedicated GPU compute budget of $25,000-$50,000 annually for model training and experimentation, which is standard at ML-focused fintech companies."

**Lever 4 — Acquisition Model Portfolio Rationalization:** "FIS's $13.5B in acquisitions brought in diverse ML models and rule-based systems — some effective, many outdated, all poorly documented. The ML/AI Engineer who can audit this model portfolio, identify what should be retrained on modern architectures, and build a unified ML platform for Total Issuing is preventing millions in fraud losses while eliminating legacy model maintenance costs. I'd like a $25,000-$35,000 signing bonus to begin this model audit immediately as part of the Pure-Play FinTech rationalization effort."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $235,000 base (New York) or $200,000 base (Jacksonville) with a $240,000 RSU grant over four years, a $35,000 signing bonus, and a dedicated GPU/compute budget. Frame ML/AI engineering as the differentiation layer for Total Issuing — without intelligent features, FIS is selling commodity infrastructure. Anchor to the Pure-Play FinTech peer set where ML engineers command premium compensation. Target 22-28% total comp increase over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $175,000 base (NYC) / $150,000 base (JAX) with at least $100,000 in RSUs. If the RSU budget is constrained, negotiate for a performance-based ML model impact bonus of $20,000-$40,000 annually tied to fraud detection improvement metrics or model deployment milestones.
