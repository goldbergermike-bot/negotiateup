**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at FIS are at the epicenter of the company's most significant organizational transformation in a decade. The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 did not just divest a business unit — it triggered a wholesale restructuring of engineering teams around FIS's new Pure-Play FinTech identity. Engineering Managers are responsible for rebuilding team charters, realigning talent to the Total Issuing platform roadmap, and retaining critical engineers through a period of profound strategic change. This is not steady-state people management; it is transformation leadership.

The Pure-Play FinTech pivot means FIS engineering teams are shifting from a conglomerate operating model — where merchant acquiring, banking, and capital markets operated as semi-independent fiefdoms — to an integrated platform organization centered on Total Issuing and core banking modernization. Engineering Managers who can navigate this transition, retain top performers through the turbulence, and hire aggressively into the $500M incremental cash flow investment envelope are worth significantly more than a typical EM at a stable enterprise. FIS's $13.5B acquisition history means EMs must also manage the cultural integration of engineers from diverse legacy organizations — SunGard, Metavante, eFunds, and others — while building a cohesive modern engineering culture.

Your negotiation leverage comes from the fact that FIS needs EMs who can simultaneously execute on three fronts: retain existing talent through the divestiture transition, recruit new talent at fintech-competitive rates, and deliver the Total Issuing platform on schedule. This triple mandate is rare, and your compensation should reflect it.

### Total Issuing — The Pure-Play FinTech Premium

**Lever 1 — Transformation Leadership Premium:** "FIS is not in a steady-state hiring mode — the $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 triggered the most significant organizational transformation in the company's history. As an Engineering Manager, I'll be rebuilding team structures, rechartering squads around the Pure-Play FinTech mission, and managing through unprecedented change. Transformation EMs command a 20-25% premium over steady-state EMs, and I'd like my offer to reflect that reality: $255,000-$260,000 base in New York."

**Lever 2 — Total Issuing Delivery Accountability:** "The Total Issuing platform is FIS's most critical product investment, and the Engineering Manager for this domain owns delivery accountability for a team of 8-15 engineers building the platform that justifies FIS's entire Pure-Play FinTech thesis. I'd like an RSU grant of $280,000-$320,000 over four years, with the understanding that my team's delivery velocity directly impacts FIS's stock price and market narrative."

**Lever 3 — Retention Through Transformation:** "With $500M in incremental cash flow post-divestiture, FIS has the budget to retain top engineers — but the Engineering Manager is the one who actually executes retention. I know from experience that the 6-12 months following a major divestiture are the highest-attrition period, and the EM who prevents a talent exodus during this window saves the company millions in replacement costs. I'm asking for a $35,000-$40,000 signing bonus to reflect the immediate retention impact I'll have from day one."

**Lever 4 — Acquisition Culture Integration:** "FIS's $13.5B in acquisitions created engineering teams with fundamentally different cultures, tools, and processes. The Engineering Manager who can unify these teams into a high-performing Pure-Play FinTech organization is solving a problem that no amount of tooling or process documentation can address. I'd like to see a 20% target bonus (up from the standard 15%) to reflect the cultural leadership dimension of this role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $260,000 base (New York) or $225,000 base (Jacksonville) with a $320,000 RSU grant over four years and a $40,000 signing bonus. Target total first-year comp of $420,000+ (Jacksonville) or $520,000+ (New York). Frame the conversation around the Pure-Play FinTech transformation mandate — this is not a maintenance EM role, it is a change leadership position. Accept-at floor: $200,000 base (NYC) / $175,000 base (JAX) with at least $160,000 in RSUs and a $20,000 signing bonus. If the initial offer is low, push for a guaranteed Year 2 RSU refresh of $80,000-$100,000 tied to Total Issuing team performance metrics.
