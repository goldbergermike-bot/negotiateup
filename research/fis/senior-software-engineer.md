**Negotiation DNA**

The Senior Software Engineer role at FIS sits at the critical inflection point of the company's Pure-Play FinTech transformation. Following the $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026, FIS shed its merchant acquiring business to concentrate entirely on banking technology, capital markets infrastructure, and the Total Issuing platform. Senior engineers are the execution backbone of this pivot — they own the technical designs, mentor junior engineers through the transition, and make the architectural decisions that determine whether FIS's new Pure-Play identity translates into product-market differentiation.

FIS's $13.5B acquisition history means the codebase is a patchwork of inherited systems spanning decades of financial technology evolution. Senior Software Engineers who can rationalize this technical debt while simultaneously building the next-generation Total Issuing platform are extraordinarily scarce. The company's $500M in incremental cash flow, liberated by the Worldpay divestiture, gives FIS the financial capacity to pay fintech-competitive rates — but recruiters will initially anchor to legacy enterprise compensation bands. Your job is to reframe the conversation around FIS's new peer set: Stripe, Adyen, Modern Treasury, and Fiserv's Clover platform.

The Total Issuing platform demands senior engineers who understand real-time payment authorization, tokenization, fraud detection pipelines, and multi-tenant SaaS architecture. If you bring experience in any of these domains, you hold significant leverage. FIS cannot afford delivery delays on Total Issuing — it is the proof point for the entire Pure-Play FinTech thesis that underpins their stock price.

### Total Issuing — The Pure-Play FinTech Premium

**Lever 1 — Pure-Play Revaluation Premium:** "FIS's $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 fundamentally changed the company's identity and peer group. As a Pure-Play FinTech company, FIS now competes for talent against Stripe, Adyen, and high-growth payment platforms — not just legacy enterprise vendors. I'd like my compensation to reflect this new peer set, which means a base salary of $210,000-$215,000 in New York and an RSU grant of $180,000-$200,000 over four years."

**Lever 2 — Total Issuing Delivery Criticality:** "The Total Issuing platform is the centerpiece of FIS's post-Worldpay product strategy, and the market is watching delivery milestones closely. As a senior engineer, I'll be making architectural decisions that either accelerate or delay this platform. I believe the delivery-critical nature of this work justifies a top-of-band offer — specifically, I'm looking for the upper quartile of your senior engineer comp range, plus a $25,000-$30,000 signing bonus to offset the opportunity cost of other fintech offers I'm evaluating."

**Lever 3 — $500M Cash Flow Headroom:** "I've studied FIS's post-divestiture financials, and the $500M in incremental cash flow gives the company clear headroom to invest in retention-grade compensation. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect this financial reality — $150,000-$200,000 over four years — rather than the pre-divestiture bands that may not have been updated to reflect FIS's improved capital position."

**Lever 4 — Acquisition Debt Navigation Premium:** "FIS has completed over $13.5B in acquisitions, and the resulting technical landscape requires senior engineers who can operate across legacy mainframe systems, mid-generation Java services, and modern cloud-native architectures simultaneously. This tri-modal technical fluency commands a premium in the market. I'd like to see a 15-20% base salary increase over your initial offer to reflect the scarcity of engineers who can bridge these eras while building Total Issuing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $215,000 base (New York) or $185,000 base (Jacksonville) with a $200,000 RSU grant over four years and a $30,000 signing bonus. Frame every ask around the Pure-Play FinTech transformation — FIS is not the same company it was 18 months ago, and compensation bands must reflect the new competitive reality. Target a 20-25% total comp increase over the initial offer. Accept-at floor: $170,000 base (NYC) / $145,000 base (JAX) with at least $100,000 in RSUs. If RSU budget is constrained, push for a one-time Total Issuing delivery bonus of $20,000-$40,000 tied to platform milestones, which aligns your incentives with FIS's most critical business objective.
