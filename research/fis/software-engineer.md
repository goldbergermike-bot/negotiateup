**Negotiation DNA**

FIS is undergoing its most consequential transformation since the $13.5B acquisition of Worldpay in 2019. Following the $24B Worldpay stake sale completed in January 2026, FIS has repositioned itself as a Pure-Play FinTech infrastructure company focused exclusively on banking and capital markets technology. This strategic pivot has unlocked $500M in incremental cash flow, creating both urgency and budget headroom for engineering talent that can accelerate the company's new product roadmap, anchored by the Total Issuing platform.

As a Software Engineer at FIS, you are entering a company that now competes directly with modern fintech platforms like Stripe, Adyen, and Fiserv — but with the institutional footprint of serving over 300,000 merchants and thousands of financial institutions globally. The Pure-Play FinTech transformation means engineering teams are being restructured around product-centric squads, and early hires into the new organizational model carry disproportionate influence on architecture decisions and career trajectory.

The Total Issuing platform — FIS's next-generation card issuing and payment processing stack — represents the company's flagship technical investment post-Worldpay. Software Engineers contributing to this platform are building the real-time transaction processing, API gateway, and microservices infrastructure that will define FIS's competitive position for the next decade. This creates a rare opportunity to negotiate above-market compensation by anchoring to the strategic criticality of Total Issuing delivery timelines.

### Total Issuing — The Pure-Play FinTech Premium

**Lever 1 — Post-Worldpay Talent Vacuum:** "The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 means FIS is rebuilding its engineering identity from the ground up. I understand the company is hiring aggressively to staff the Pure-Play FinTech roadmap, and I'd like my offer to reflect the premium that early hires into this new structure should command — both in base and RSU grant — given the outsized impact on architecture decisions that will compound over the vesting period."

**Lever 2 — Total Issuing Platform Urgency:** "Total Issuing is FIS's flagship platform bet, and the delivery timeline is directly tied to market credibility in the Pure-Play FinTech positioning. I'm excited to contribute to this platform, and I believe the urgency of shipping Total Issuing on schedule justifies a base salary at the top of band — I'm looking for $140,000 in Jacksonville or $165,000 in New York — because replacing me mid-build would cost far more in delivery delays."

**Lever 3 — $500M Cash Flow Reinvestment:** "With $500M in incremental cash flow unlocked by the Worldpay divestiture, FIS has the balance sheet to invest in top-tier engineering talent. I'd like to see that reinvestment reflected in my RSU grant — specifically, I'm asking for $80,000-$100,000 over four years — which aligns with what Pure-Play FinTech peers like Stripe and Adyen are offering for equivalent roles."

**Lever 4 — Acquisition-Legacy Modernization:** "FIS has integrated over $13.5B in acquisitions, and the technical debt from those integrations is a known challenge. Engineers who can navigate legacy systems while building modern microservices for Total Issuing are uniquely valuable. I'd like a signing bonus of $15,000-$20,000 to reflect the dual-skill premium of legacy modernization plus greenfield platform development."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $165,000 base (New York) or $140,000 base (Jacksonville) with a $100,000 RSU grant over four years. Anchor to the Pure-Play FinTech transformation narrative — FIS is no longer a legacy processor but a modern platform company, and compensation should reflect fintech-tier rates. Push for a 15-20% total comp premium over the initial offer by emphasizing Total Issuing delivery urgency. Accept-at floor: $130,000 base (NYC) / $110,000 base (JAX) with at least $60,000 in RSUs. If the base is firm, negotiate for an accelerated first-year RSU vest (e.g., 33% Year 1 instead of 25%) to front-load value during the critical Total Issuing launch window.
