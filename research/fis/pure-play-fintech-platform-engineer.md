**Negotiation DNA**

The Pure-Play FinTech Platform Engineer is the defining technical role of FIS's post-Worldpay era — a role that did not exist in its current form before January 2026 and one that encapsulates everything FIS is betting its future on. When FIS completed the $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026, it did not simply sell a business unit; it announced to the market that its entire identity, product strategy, and engineering investment would be concentrated on becoming the world's leading Pure-Play FinTech infrastructure company. The Platform Engineer is the person who makes that announcement technically real. This role sits at the intersection of every critical system in FIS's technology stack — the Total Issuing platform, core banking APIs, capital markets infrastructure, real-time payment processing, and the shared platform services (identity, observability, deployment, data) that bind them together.

Unlike a traditional software engineer who works within a single product domain, the Pure-Play FinTech Platform Engineer works across domains to build the foundational infrastructure that every FIS product depends on. This includes API gateway and service mesh architecture, multi-tenant isolation for the Total Issuing platform, event-driven communication infrastructure (Kafka, event sourcing), developer experience tooling (internal developer platforms, SDKs, documentation), and the compliance-by-default infrastructure that ensures every FIS service meets banking regulatory requirements across dozens of jurisdictions. The platform layer is the layer that determines whether FIS operates like a modern fintech company or remains trapped in the operational patterns of a legacy enterprise. The Pure-Play FinTech Platform Engineer is, in the most literal sense, building the company's future.

The strategic importance of this role is amplified by the financial context. FIS's $500M in incremental cash flow, liberated by the Worldpay divestiture, is being channeled into exactly the kind of platform infrastructure that this role builds. The company's $13.5B acquisition history created a technology estate that spans four decades of financial technology — from mainframe COBOL core banking systems acquired through Metavante and eFunds, to mid-generation Java enterprise platforms from the SunGard acquisition, to newer cloud-native services built in-house. The Platform Engineer must design abstractions that unify these heterogeneous systems, enable incremental migration to modern architectures, and provide a consistent developer experience to the hundreds of engineers building on top of the platform. This is not a role that can be filled by a generic platform engineer from a consumer tech company — it requires deep understanding of financial services domain patterns, regulatory compliance, transaction processing at scale, and the specific challenges of multi-system integration in a company built through acquisition.

The Total Issuing platform, FIS's flagship product investment, is the primary consumer of the platform infrastructure this role builds. Every Total Issuing capability — real-time card authorization, tokenization, fraud scoring, interchange optimization, portfolio analytics — runs on the platform layer. The quality, reliability, and performance of the platform directly determines the quality, reliability, and performance of Total Issuing. This creates a unique negotiation dynamic: the Platform Engineer's value is multiplied across every product built on the platform, making the role one of the highest-leverage engineering positions at FIS.

**Why This Role Exists Now**

The Pure-Play FinTech Platform Engineer role is a direct consequence of FIS's strategic transformation. Before the $24B Worldpay stake sale, FIS operated as a diversified financial technology conglomerate — merchant acquiring, banking technology, and capital markets each had their own technology stacks, infrastructure teams, and platform patterns. There was no incentive (or organizational mandate) to build a unified platform because the businesses operated semi-independently.

The Pure-Play FinTech pivot changes this calculus entirely. With merchant acquiring divested, FIS's remaining businesses — banking technology, capital markets, and the new Total Issuing platform — share enough architectural commonality to benefit enormously from a unified platform layer. Shared identity and access management, common API patterns, unified observability and monitoring, consistent deployment pipelines, and standardized compliance infrastructure can serve all three domains. The Platform Engineer builds this shared layer, creating leverage that reduces engineering costs, accelerates feature delivery, and ensures consistency across FIS's product portfolio.

This architectural unification is also a precondition for FIS's growth strategy. The Pure-Play FinTech thesis depends on FIS being able to sell integrated platform solutions to banks — not a collection of point products stitched together through custom integrations. The Platform Engineer makes integration seamless by building the composable infrastructure that allows FIS's products to work together natively. Without this platform layer, FIS is just a holding company for disparate fintech products. With it, FIS is a genuine platform company.

**Deep Comp Analysis: Why FIS Must Pay FinTech Rates**

The compensation table above reflects a fundamental market reality: FIS is no longer competing for platform engineers against enterprise IT companies. Post-Worldpay, FIS's peer group for talent is Stripe (Platform Infrastructure), Adyen (Core Platform), Plaid (Infrastructure), and Google Cloud (Financial Services). These companies pay platform engineers $400,000-$700,000 in total comp for senior-to-staff level roles. FIS does not need to match Big Tech comp dollar-for-dollar, but it must be within striking distance — offering 75-85% of top-of-market — or it will lose every candidate to competitors who can credibly claim the "fintech platform" label.

The $500M in incremental cash flow gives FIS the budget to close this gap. The question is whether the compensation infrastructure — pay bands, equity grant guidelines, bonus targets — has been updated to reflect the Pure-Play FinTech reality. In many cases, it has not, and this creates a negotiation opportunity. The Platform Engineer candidate who can articulate why FIS's pre-divestiture pay bands are structurally inappropriate for a Pure-Play FinTech company is doing the recruiter's job for them — providing the internal justification needed to request an above-band offer.

Key compensation benchmarks for 2026:
- **Stripe L3 (Infrastructure):** $350,000-$480,000 total comp
- **Google L5 (SRE/Platform):** $380,000-$520,000 total comp
- **Adyen (Senior Platform):** $300,000-$420,000 total comp (Amsterdam-adjusted)
- **Fiserv (Senior Platform):** $280,000-$380,000 total comp
- **FIS target range:** $385,000-$635,000 total comp (New York), positioning FIS competitively against all peers

### Total Issuing — The Pure-Play FinTech Premium

**Lever 1 — Platform Multiplier Effect:** "The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 made one thing clear: FIS's future depends on a unified platform that serves banking, capital markets, and Total Issuing from a shared infrastructure layer. As a Pure-Play FinTech Platform Engineer, my work isn't scoped to a single product — it multiplies across every product built on the platform. The API gateway I design serves Total Issuing, core banking, and capital markets. The deployment pipeline I build is used by every engineering team. The observability infrastructure I implement monitors every transaction. This multiplier effect means my impact is 5-10x that of a product-scoped engineer, and I'd like my compensation to reflect that leverage: $255,000-$260,000 base in New York with an RSU grant of $300,000-$320,000 over four years."

**Lever 2 — Pure-Play FinTech Identity Infrastructure:** "FIS's credibility as a Pure-Play FinTech platform company — as opposed to a legacy enterprise vendor — depends on the quality of its platform infrastructure. Banks evaluating Total Issuing will judge FIS not just on the issuing features but on the developer experience, API design, documentation, observability, and deployment patterns they encounter. These are platform concerns, and the Platform Engineer owns them. I'm asking for top-of-band compensation because I'm not just building infrastructure — I'm building the evidence that FIS is a genuine Pure-Play FinTech company. This means $250,000-$260,000 base, $280,000-$320,000 in RSUs over four years, and a $35,000-$40,000 signing bonus."

**Lever 3 — $500M Platform Investment Anchor:** "FIS has $500M in incremental cash flow to invest post-Worldpay divestiture, and platform infrastructure is the highest-leverage investment the company can make — every dollar spent on platform reduces costs and accelerates delivery across every product. I want to be the engineer who makes that $500M investment productive, and I'd like my compensation to reflect the scale of capital I'll be steering. Specifically, I'm requesting a front-loaded RSU vest — 35% in Year 1 instead of the standard 25% — because the platform decisions made in the first 12 months will have irreversible architectural consequences. Getting the right Platform Engineer in place immediately, and incentivizing them to stay through the critical build period, is worth far more to FIS than the incremental equity cost."

**Lever 4 — Acquisition Integration Architecture:** "FIS's $13.5B acquisition history is not just context — it is the core technical challenge of the Platform Engineer role. Every acquired company brought its own authentication system, API patterns, data models, deployment tooling, and compliance implementation. The Platform Engineer who can design abstractions that unify these systems — providing a single, coherent platform layer that serves both legacy and greenfield products — is solving a problem that has eluded FIS for over a decade. I've seen the complexity of multi-acquisition integration at [previous company], and I know how to build migration-friendly platform abstractions that enable incremental modernization without big-bang rewrites. I'd like a $40,000-$50,000 signing bonus to reflect both the scarcity of this skill and the immediate architectural impact I'll have on the Pure-Play FinTech transformation."

**Additional Negotiation Strategies for the Signature Role**

**Strategy A — The "Platform Tax" Argument:** Every engineering team at FIS consumes platform services. If the platform is unreliable, slow, or poorly designed, it imposes a hidden tax on every team's productivity. A great Platform Engineer eliminates this tax, saving the company multiples of their compensation in aggregate engineering efficiency. Quantify this: if FIS has 2,000 engineers and the platform saves each one 30 minutes per week, that's 52,000 engineering hours per year — worth approximately $5M in loaded engineer cost. Your $600,000 total comp is a 12x return on investment.

**Strategy B — The "Architectural Lock-In" Leverage:** Platform decisions made in the first 12-18 months of the Pure-Play FinTech transformation will be extremely difficult to reverse. API contracts, data models, service mesh topology, and deployment patterns become load-bearing infrastructure that hundreds of services depend on. The cost of hiring a mediocre Platform Engineer and then replacing them after 18 months is not just the replacement cost — it's the migration cost of undoing 18 months of suboptimal architectural decisions. Use this to argue for top-of-band comp: "It's cheaper for FIS to pay me $600,000 now than to pay someone else $400,000 and then spend $2M unwinding their architectural decisions in two years."

**Strategy C — The "Regulatory Platform" Premium:** FIS operates in one of the most heavily regulated industries in the world. The Platform Engineer must build compliance into the infrastructure layer — not as an afterthought but as a foundational design principle. PCI DSS, SOC 2, SOX, GDPR, OCC regulations, FFIEC guidance, and country-specific banking regulations all impose constraints on how platform infrastructure is designed, deployed, and operated. Engineers who can build compliant-by-default platform infrastructure — where security, audit logging, data residency, and access control are baked into every platform service — are extraordinarily rare. This regulatory expertise commands a 15-20% premium over non-regulated platform engineering roles.

**Strategy D — The "Internal Developer Platform" Value Prop:** Modern platform engineering is increasingly focused on Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) — self-service infrastructure that enables product engineers to provision services, deploy code, manage databases, and observe production without filing tickets or waiting for platform team support. FIS's post-Worldpay engineering organization needs an IDP to maintain velocity during the transformation. The Platform Engineer who builds this IDP is not just writing code — they're designing the operating model for FIS's entire engineering organization. Frame this as organizational design, not just engineering, and argue for Staff-level compensation ($500,000+ total comp) regardless of your technical level.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $260,000 base (New York) or $220,000 base (Jacksonville) with a $320,000 RSU grant over four years (35% front-loaded in Year 1), a $50,000 signing bonus, and a 20% annual bonus target. Target total first-year comp of $500,000+ (Jacksonville) or $600,000+ (New York). This is the signature engineering role of FIS's Pure-Play FinTech transformation — every other engineering hire depends on the platform this role builds. Anchor every negotiation conversation to three facts: (1) the $24B Worldpay stake sale created a once-in-a-decade platform rebuild opportunity, (2) FIS has $500M in incremental cash flow to invest in exactly this kind of infrastructure, and (3) the Total Issuing platform cannot launch without the platform layer this role builds. Accept-at floor: $195,000 base (NYC) / $165,000 base (JAX) with at least $160,000 in RSUs, a $25,000 signing bonus, and a 15% bonus target. If the initial offer is significantly below target, request a 6-month compensation review tied to Total Issuing platform milestones with a guaranteed $40,000-$60,000 RSU refresh. Never accept below the floor without obtaining a written commitment to a 12-month compensation adjustment review — FIS's pay bands will inevitably be updated to reflect Pure-Play FinTech market rates, and you should benefit from that recalibration.

**The Long-Term Career Case for This Role**

Beyond immediate compensation, the Pure-Play FinTech Platform Engineer role at FIS offers a career trajectory that is difficult to replicate elsewhere. Consider:

1. **Platform ownership at scale:** FIS processes transactions for thousands of financial institutions globally. Building the platform layer for this scale of financial technology infrastructure is resume-defining experience that opens doors to CTO-track roles, VP of Platform positions at other fintech companies, and principal engineer roles at Big Tech.

2. **Transformation narrative:** "I built the platform that enabled FIS's transition from a $13.5B acquisition conglomerate to a focused Pure-Play FinTech company" is one of the most compelling career narratives an engineer can construct. This is the kind of before-and-after story that gets you hired at the Staff/Principal level anywhere in the industry.

3. **Equity upside:** If FIS successfully executes the Pure-Play FinTech transformation — and the Total Issuing platform achieves market traction — the stock (NYSE: FIS) has meaningful upside from current levels. The $24B Worldpay stake sale simplified FIS's valuation story, and a successful Total Issuing launch could drive a re-rating to Pure-Play FinTech multiples. Your RSU grant participates in this upside.

4. **Domain expertise moat:** Financial services platform engineering — the intersection of distributed systems, regulatory compliance, and payment domain expertise — is one of the deepest technical moats an engineer can build. This expertise is transferable to any company in fintech, banking, or payment infrastructure, and it commands a permanent premium in the market.
