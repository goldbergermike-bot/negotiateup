**Negotiation DNA**

The Staff Software Engineer at FIS occupies the most architecturally consequential role in the company's post-Worldpay technical organization. Following the $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026, FIS's engineering leadership is rebuilding the company's entire platform architecture around a Pure-Play FinTech thesis — and Staff Engineers are the ones drawing the blueprints. This role owns cross-team technical strategy, defines API contracts between platform domains, and sets the architectural patterns that hundreds of downstream engineers will implement. In the context of FIS's Total Issuing platform buildout, Staff Engineers effectively determine whether the company's biggest product bet succeeds or fails.

FIS's transformation from a conglomerate payment-and-banking company into a focused Pure-Play FinTech infrastructure provider means the Staff Engineer role carries more strategic weight than at any point in the company's history. The $13.5B in accumulated acquisitions left FIS with a sprawling technology estate — mainframe COBOL systems for core banking, mid-generation Java monoliths from the SunGard acquisition, and newer cloud-native services. Staff Engineers must define the migration pathways, establish domain boundaries, and architect the target state for Total Issuing while keeping production systems running for thousands of financial institutions.

With $500M in incremental cash flow available post-divestiture, FIS has the financial capacity to pay top-of-market rates for Staff-level talent. However, the company's compensation infrastructure may still reflect pre-transformation enterprise bands. Your negotiation strategy should center on the fact that FIS's true peer group is now Stripe (Staff Engineer L4), Adyen, and high-growth fintech platforms — not traditional enterprise IT vendors. The scarcity of Staff Engineers with both payments domain expertise and modern distributed systems skills gives you exceptional leverage.

### Total Issuing — The Pure-Play FinTech Premium

**Lever 1 — Architecture Ownership Premium:** "As a Staff Engineer, I'll own the cross-cutting architectural decisions for the Total Issuing platform — the single most important product in FIS's post-Worldpay Pure-Play FinTech strategy. The $24B Worldpay stake sale was predicated on FIS's ability to deliver a world-class issuing platform, and the architect of that platform should be compensated accordingly. I'm looking for a base of $265,000-$270,000 in New York with an RSU grant of $320,000-$360,000 over four years."

**Lever 2 — Pure-Play FinTech Peer Calibration:** "Post-divestiture, FIS competes for Staff-level talent against Stripe, where L4 total comp ranges from $550,000 to $750,000, and Google L6, where total comp starts at $500,000. As a Pure-Play FinTech company with a $45B+ market cap, FIS should be calibrating Staff Engineer offers against these peers — not against enterprise IT or legacy processor bands. I'd like to see total comp in the $600,000-$688,000 range to be competitive."

**Lever 3 — $500M Reinvestment in Technical Leadership:** "FIS's $500M in incremental cash flow from the Worldpay divestiture represents a generational opportunity to invest in technical leadership. Staff Engineers drive 10x the architectural impact of individual contributors — a single misguided architectural decision at this level can cost millions in rework. I'm asking for an RSU grant that reflects this leverage: $280,000-$360,000 over four years, with 30% front-loaded in Year 1 to align with Total Issuing's critical delivery window."

**Lever 4 — Acquisition Integration Architect:** "FIS's $13.5B acquisition history created one of the most complex technology estates in financial services. The Staff Engineer who can rationalize this landscape — defining what gets modernized, what gets sunset, and how Total Issuing unifies the best of each system — is worth more than a greenfield architect at a startup. I'd like a $40,000-$50,000 signing bonus to reflect the unique domain expertise required to architect at FIS's scale and complexity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $270,000 base (New York) or $235,000 base (Jacksonville) with a $360,000 RSU grant over four years (30% Year 1 front-load) and a $50,000 signing bonus. Target total first-year comp of $450,000+ (Jacksonville) or $550,000+ (New York). Anchor every conversation to the Pure-Play FinTech peer set — Stripe L4, Google L6, Meta E6 — and refuse to benchmark against legacy enterprise compensation. Accept-at floor: $210,000 base (NYC) / $185,000 base (JAX) with at least $200,000 in RSUs and a $30,000 signing bonus. If the Total Issuing platform is on a compressed timeline, negotiate a $50,000-$75,000 platform delivery bonus tied to GA milestones.
