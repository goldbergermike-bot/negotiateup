**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at FIS occupy the critical junction between product capability and client revenue. They translate the Total Issuing platform's technical architecture into client-specific deployment designs, integration blueprints, and migration plans that determine whether FIS wins or loses multi-million-dollar deals. Following the $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026, FIS's sales motion is fundamentally changing — the company must now sell its Pure-Play FinTech platform story to banks and financial institutions that may have previously bought FIS's bundled merchant-acquiring-plus-banking package. Solutions Architects are the ones making this new story technically credible in client presentations.

The Pure-Play FinTech transformation creates a unique challenge for Solutions Architects: they must reposition FIS's technology narrative from "diversified payment conglomerate" to "focused platform company" while simultaneously designing solutions that bridge clients' legacy FIS integrations with the new Total Issuing architecture. FIS's $13.5B acquisition history means clients may be running multiple FIS products acquired through different channels — SunGard trading systems, Metavante core banking, legacy FIS card processing — and the Solutions Architect must design coherent migration paths to the unified platform.

With $500M in incremental cash flow available for investment, FIS is expanding its pre-sales and solutions engineering capability to accelerate Total Issuing adoption. Solutions Architects who combine deep fintech domain expertise with consultative selling skills and hands-on architectural design are the revenue accelerators that FIS needs to validate its Pure-Play FinTech market position.

### Total Issuing — The Pure-Play FinTech Premium

**Lever 1 — Revenue-Attached Architecture:** "Every Total Issuing deal that FIS closes starts with a Solutions Architect designing the client deployment. Following the $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026, FIS needs to rapidly build a pipeline of Pure-Play FinTech platform deals — and I'm the technical closer who makes those deals architecturally viable. I'd like my compensation to reflect the revenue attachment of this role: $225,000-$230,000 base in New York with an RSU grant of $180,000-$200,000 over four years, plus a variable component tied to deal closure."

**Lever 2 — Pure-Play FinTech Narrative Authority:** "FIS's Pure-Play FinTech positioning is only as credible as the architecture we present to clients. As a Solutions Architect, I'm the one in the room translating FIS's strategic vision into technical designs that bank CTOs trust. I'd like a 20-25% variable bonus target tied to Total Issuing pipeline influence — this aligns my incentives directly with FIS's most important commercial objective."

**Lever 3 — $500M GTM Investment:** "FIS has $500M in incremental cash flow to invest post-divestiture, and a portion of that is going toward expanding the Solutions Architecture team to drive Total Issuing adoption. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect the company's commitment to this GTM investment: $160,000-$200,000 over four years, which positions me competitively against Solutions Architect offers from Stripe, AWS Financial Services, and other platforms targeting FIS's client base."

**Lever 4 — Legacy Migration Expertise:** "FIS's $13.5B in acquisitions means many clients are running multiple legacy FIS products that need migration paths to Total Issuing. Solutions Architects who can design zero-downtime migration architectures for mission-critical banking systems — while maintaining regulatory compliance — are extraordinarily rare. I'd like a $25,000-$30,000 signing bonus to reflect the immediate revenue impact of having a migration-capable SA on the Pure-Play FinTech team."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $230,000 base (New York) or $195,000 base (Jacksonville) with a $200,000 RSU grant over four years, a $30,000 signing bonus, and a 20-25% variable bonus target. Frame the role as revenue-critical, not support-adjacent — Solutions Architects directly determine whether Total Issuing deals close. Anchor to the Pure-Play FinTech GTM transformation and FIS's need to win platform deals against Stripe, Adyen, and Fiserv. Target 20-25% total comp increase over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $175,000 base (NYC) / $150,000 base (JAX) with at least $100,000 in RSUs and a minimum 15% variable bonus target.
