**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at FIS are entering a company that is undergoing a radical transformation in how it thinks about user experience. For decades, FIS products were built for back-office banking operations where usability was an afterthought — enterprise software sold through long procurement cycles to IT departments, not end users. The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 and the subsequent Pure-Play FinTech pivot changes this equation entirely. FIS now competes with Stripe, Plaid, and modern developer-first fintech platforms where design quality is a core differentiator. The Total Issuing platform must look, feel, and function like a modern fintech product — not a legacy banking system.

This transformation creates an unusual opportunity for Product Designers. FIS has $500M in incremental cash flow post-divestiture to invest in product development, and a meaningful portion of that investment must go toward design infrastructure: design systems, component libraries, developer portals, and API documentation experiences. Designers who can bring modern fintech design standards to FIS's Total Issuing platform are building something from near-scratch, which means more creative ownership than a typical enterprise design role.

FIS's $13.5B acquisition history means the current product surface area is a patchwork of inconsistent design languages, navigation patterns, and interaction models inherited from dozens of acquired companies. The Product Designer who can unify this under a coherent Pure-Play FinTech design system is solving a problem that directly impacts customer retention, developer adoption, and platform revenue.

### Total Issuing — The Pure-Play FinTech Premium

**Lever 1 — Design System Greenfield Opportunity:** "The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 left FIS needing to rebuild its design identity for the Pure-Play FinTech era. The Total Issuing platform requires a modern, developer-friendly design system built from the ground up — this isn't iterating on an existing product, it's defining the visual and interaction language for FIS's entire future product portfolio. I'd like my compensation to reflect this foundational design leadership: $175,000-$180,000 base in New York with an RSU grant of $120,000-$140,000 over four years."

**Lever 2 — FinTech UX Scarcity Premium:** "Post-Worldpay, FIS competes directly with Stripe, Plaid, and Adyen for design talent — companies that are known for exceptional design quality. Designers who understand fintech UX patterns, developer experience design, and API documentation are scarce and command a premium. As a Pure-Play FinTech company, FIS needs to offer design compensation in the fintech range, not the enterprise banking range. I'm looking for total comp of $300,000+ in New York."

**Lever 3 — $500M Design Infrastructure Investment:** "FIS has $500M in incremental cash flow to invest post-divestiture, and a meaningful portion of that must go toward design infrastructure if Total Issuing is going to compete with modern fintech platforms. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect the scale of this design investment — $100,000-$140,000 over four years — because the designer who builds FIS's foundational design system is creating leveraged value across every product in the portfolio."

**Lever 4 — Acquisition UX Consolidation:** "FIS's $13.5B in acquisitions created a fragmented user experience across dozens of products. The Product Designer who can audit, rationalize, and unify these experiences under a coherent Pure-Play FinTech design language is solving a multi-million-dollar retention problem. I'd like a $15,000-$20,000 signing bonus to begin the UX audit immediately, plus a commitment to revisit compensation after 6 months based on Total Issuing design system adoption metrics."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $180,000 base (New York) or $155,000 base (Jacksonville) with a $140,000 RSU grant over four years and a $20,000 signing bonus. Anchor to the Pure-Play FinTech design transformation — FIS is building a new design language for a new company identity, and that greenfield opportunity commands a premium over incremental design work. Target 15-20% total comp increase over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $140,000 base (NYC) / $115,000 base (JAX) with at least $70,000 in RSUs. If design leadership resists fintech-tier compensation, propose a 6-month design system milestone review with a guaranteed $20,000-$30,000 RSU refresh tied to Total Issuing design adoption.
