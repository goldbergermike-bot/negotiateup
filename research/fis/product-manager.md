**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at FIS are defining the roadmap for a company in the midst of its most consequential strategic pivot. The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 stripped away FIS's merchant acquiring business, leaving a Pure-Play FinTech company that must now justify its market valuation through product innovation in banking technology, capital markets infrastructure, and the flagship Total Issuing platform. PMs are the ones translating this corporate strategy into product specifications, feature priorities, and go-to-market plans that determine whether FIS's Pure-Play FinTech narrative holds up to investor and customer scrutiny.

The Total Issuing platform is the centerpiece of FIS's post-Worldpay product portfolio, and the PM who owns this domain effectively owns the company's growth story. With $500M in incremental cash flow available for reinvestment, FIS has the budget to build aggressively — but Product Managers must direct that investment wisely across card issuing, real-time payments, fraud prevention, and API platform capabilities. PMs with fintech product experience, particularly in issuing, BaaS (Banking-as-a-Service), or payment orchestration, hold exceptional leverage because they bring domain expertise that FIS's $13.5B acquisition history never fully developed organically.

The transition from a diversified payment conglomerate to a focused platform company means PMs must also manage the product rationalization process — deciding which legacy products from acquired companies survive, which get sunset, and which get rebuilt on the Total Issuing stack. This is product strategy at its most consequential.

### Total Issuing — The Pure-Play FinTech Premium

**Lever 1 — Platform Strategy Ownership:** "The Total Issuing platform is FIS's most important product bet following the $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026. As the Product Manager for this domain, I'm not just managing a feature backlog — I'm defining the product strategy that justifies FIS's Pure-Play FinTech valuation. I'd like my compensation to reflect the strategic gravity of this role: $210,000-$215,000 base in New York with an RSU grant of $200,000-$220,000 over four years."

**Lever 2 — Pure-Play FinTech Product Differentiation:** "Post-Worldpay, FIS must prove that its Pure-Play FinTech products can compete with Stripe Treasury, Marqeta, and Galileo in the issuing space. The PM who builds a differentiated Total Issuing product is worth more than a PM managing incremental features on a mature platform. I'm asking for top-of-band compensation because this is a product creation role, not a product maintenance role."

**Lever 3 — $500M Investment Allocation Authority:** "FIS has $500M in incremental cash flow to reinvest post-divestiture, and the Product Manager directly influences how that capital gets allocated across the Total Issuing roadmap. A PM with poor prioritization can waste tens of millions; a great PM multiplies investment returns. I'd like my bonus target to be 20-25% of base, not the standard 15%, to reflect the investment allocation authority inherent in this role."

**Lever 4 — Acquisition Portfolio Rationalization:** "FIS's $13.5B acquisition history means the product portfolio includes dozens of overlapping offerings. The PM who can rationalize this portfolio — sunsetting legacy products, migrating customers to Total Issuing, and maintaining revenue through the transition — saves FIS millions in maintenance costs while accelerating the Pure-Play FinTech narrative. I'd like a $25,000-$30,000 signing bonus to reflect the immediate portfolio optimization impact I'll have."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $215,000 base (New York) or $185,000 base (Jacksonville) with a $220,000 RSU grant over four years and a $30,000 signing bonus. Frame the PM role as product strategy ownership, not feature management. Anchor to the Pure-Play FinTech transformation — FIS needs PMs who can build platform products from first principles, not maintain legacy feature sets. Target 20-25% total comp increase over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $165,000 base (NYC) / $140,000 base (JAX) with at least $100,000 in RSUs. If equity is constrained, negotiate for Total Issuing revenue-share or milestone bonuses of $20,000-$40,000 tied to platform adoption metrics.
