**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at FIS protect one of the most consequential technology platforms in global financial services. FIS processes transactions for thousands of banks and financial institutions, making it a tier-one target for nation-state threat actors, organized cybercrime syndicates, and sophisticated fraud rings. The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 and the subsequent Pure-Play FinTech pivot created both new security opportunities and new security risks — the organizational boundary changes, system decommissioning, and data migration associated with the divestiture represent exactly the kind of transition period that adversaries exploit.

The Pure-Play FinTech transformation means FIS's security posture must evolve from protecting a diversified payment conglomerate to securing a focused platform company. The Total Issuing platform introduces new attack surfaces — real-time card issuing APIs, tokenization services, webhook endpoints, and developer-facing SDKs — that require security engineers who understand both application security and financial services threat models. With $500M in incremental cash flow available post-divestiture, FIS is investing heavily in security capabilities, including zero-trust architecture, real-time fraud detection, and security automation.

FIS's $13.5B acquisition history created a security landscape of exceptional complexity — dozens of overlapping identity systems, inconsistent encryption standards, heterogeneous logging and monitoring infrastructure, and legacy systems that may not support modern security controls. Security Engineers who can rationalize this landscape while building security-by-default into the Total Issuing platform are among the most critical and difficult-to-recruit roles in the organization.

### Total Issuing — The Pure-Play FinTech Premium

**Lever 1 — Post-Divestiture Security Criticality:** "The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 created the exact kind of organizational transition that threat actors target — system boundary changes, data migration, access control restructuring, and personnel turnover. As a Security Engineer joining during this critical window, I'm providing immediate risk reduction value. I'd like my compensation to reflect the urgency of the Pure-Play FinTech security mandate: $210,000-$215,000 base in New York with an RSU grant of $160,000-$180,000 over four years."

**Lever 2 — Total Issuing Attack Surface Ownership:** "Total Issuing introduces entirely new attack surfaces for FIS — real-time card issuing APIs, tokenization endpoints, developer SDKs, and webhook infrastructure. The Security Engineer who builds the threat model and security architecture for Total Issuing is protecting FIS's most important product and its Pure-Play FinTech market position. I'm asking for top-of-band compensation because the consequences of a security failure on Total Issuing would be catastrophic to FIS's brand, stock price, and regulatory standing."

**Lever 3 — $500M Security Infrastructure Investment:** "FIS has $500M in incremental cash flow to invest post-divestiture, and security infrastructure is a non-negotiable component of that investment — regulators, clients, and auditors demand it. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect the criticality of security investment: $140,000-$180,000 over four years, which positions my compensation competitively against Stripe, where security engineers work on comparable payment infrastructure."

**Lever 4 — Acquisition Security Debt Resolution:** "FIS's $13.5B in acquisitions created a security landscape with dozens of overlapping identity providers, inconsistent encryption standards, and legacy systems that predate modern security frameworks. The Security Engineer who can audit, rationalize, and modernize this landscape — while building secure-by-default patterns for Total Issuing — is solving a multi-year, multi-million-dollar security debt problem. I'd like a $20,000-$25,000 signing bonus and a commitment to security tooling budget authority as part of the Pure-Play FinTech transformation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $215,000 base (New York) or $185,000 base (Jacksonville) with a $180,000 RSU grant over four years and a $25,000 signing bonus. Frame security as existential, not overhead — a single breach could cost FIS hundreds of millions in regulatory fines, client attrition, and reputational damage. Anchor to the Pure-Play FinTech transformation, which creates both new attack surfaces (Total Issuing APIs) and transition-period risk. Target 18-22% total comp increase over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $165,000 base (NYC) / $140,000 base (JAX) with at least $90,000 in RSUs. If comp is firm, negotiate for a security conference budget ($10,000/year for Black Hat, DEF CON, RSA) and guaranteed tooling procurement authority.
