**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at FIS are the connective tissue of the company's most ambitious transformation in a decade. The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 did not merely divest a business — it launched a complex, multi-year program of platform consolidation, organizational restructuring, and product development that must be orchestrated with precision. TPMs at FIS are responsible for driving the cross-functional delivery of the Total Issuing platform, coordinating dozens of engineering teams, managing dependencies across legacy and greenfield systems, and ensuring that FIS's Pure-Play FinTech transformation stays on schedule and on budget.

FIS's $13.5B acquisition history means the program management challenge is exponentially harder than at a company built organically. Every major initiative touches systems inherited from different acquisitions — SunGard's capital markets platforms, Metavante's core banking stack, legacy card processing systems — each with their own release cadences, testing requirements, and compliance constraints. TPMs who can navigate this complexity while maintaining delivery velocity are exceptionally valuable. The $500M in incremental cash flow post-Worldpay divestiture funds an ambitious delivery roadmap, but that investment is wasted without TPMs who can turn budget into shipped product.

The Total Issuing platform alone represents the kind of program that would define a TPM's career at any company — a multi-year, multi-team platform buildout with hard dependencies on infrastructure modernization, data migration, API standardization, and regulatory compliance across dozens of markets. TPMs who have delivered similar programs at scale in fintech or financial services hold commanding leverage.

### Total Issuing — The Pure-Play FinTech Premium

**Lever 1 — Transformation Program Ownership:** "The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 launched the most complex transformation program in FIS's history — and that program needs a TPM who can drive execution across engineering, product, compliance, and operations simultaneously. I'm not managing a steady-state development cadence; I'm orchestrating a corporate transformation that touches every engineering team in the Pure-Play FinTech organization. I'd like my compensation to reflect this scope: $215,000-$220,000 base in New York with an RSU grant of $180,000-$200,000 over four years."

**Lever 2 — Total Issuing Delivery Timeline:** "The Total Issuing platform has hard delivery milestones that are tied to FIS's market credibility and stock price narrative. As the TPM, I own the delivery timeline — managing dependencies, unblocking teams, and making tradeoff decisions that determine whether FIS ships on schedule. I'm asking for a 20% bonus target (up from standard 15%) tied to Total Issuing delivery milestones, because my performance is directly measurable against the company's most important commercial commitment."

**Lever 3 — $500M Program Execution:** "FIS has $500M in incremental cash flow to invest post-divestiture, and the TPM is the one who ensures that investment translates into delivered product rather than organizational friction and missed deadlines. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect the leverage of effective program management at this scale: $150,000-$200,000 over four years, with the understanding that a great TPM can save or waste tens of millions in engineering efficiency."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Acquisition Coordination Complexity:** "FIS's $13.5B in acquisitions created an engineering organization with fundamentally different processes, tools, and release cadences. The TPM who can impose a coherent delivery framework across this heterogeneous landscape — while maintaining the delivery velocity required for the Pure-Play FinTech transformation — is solving a coordination problem that doesn't exist at organically grown companies. I'd like a $20,000-$25,000 signing bonus and a guaranteed first-year RSU refresh review to reflect this exceptional complexity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $220,000 base (New York) or $190,000 base (Jacksonville) with a $200,000 RSU grant over four years, a $25,000 signing bonus, and a 20% bonus target. Frame the TPM role as transformation program leadership, not project management — the distinction matters for compensation bands. Anchor to the Pure-Play FinTech delivery mandate and the fact that FIS's Total Issuing timeline is a board-level priority. Target 20-25% total comp increase over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $170,000 base (NYC) / $145,000 base (JAX) with at least $90,000 in RSUs and a 15% bonus target. If equity is constrained, negotiate for milestone bonuses of $15,000-$30,000 tied to Total Issuing GA delivery dates.
