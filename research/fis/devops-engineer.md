**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at FIS are responsible for the infrastructure that underpins one of the world's largest financial technology operations. FIS processes mission-critical transactions for thousands of banks and financial institutions — systems where downtime is measured not in user frustration but in regulatory penalties, financial losses, and institutional trust erosion. The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 dramatically changed the scope of FIS's infrastructure challenge. The Pure-Play FinTech pivot means FIS is consolidating from a sprawling, multi-business infrastructure footprint to a focused, modern cloud-native architecture centered on the Total Issuing platform and core banking services.

This infrastructure transformation is massive. FIS's $13.5B acquisition history left behind heterogeneous infrastructure spanning on-premise data centers, multiple cloud providers, legacy CI/CD pipelines, and inconsistent monitoring and observability stacks inherited from SunGard, Metavante, and other acquisitions. DevOps Engineers who can rationalize this infrastructure, implement modern platform engineering practices, and build the deployment pipelines for Total Issuing are among the most critical hires in the post-Worldpay organization.

With $500M in incremental cash flow post-divestiture, FIS is investing aggressively in infrastructure modernization — Kubernetes adoption, infrastructure-as-code standardization, GitOps workflows, and observability platforms. DevOps Engineers who bring experience with financial services compliance requirements (SOC 2, PCI DSS, SOX) alongside modern platform engineering skills command a significant premium because the intersection of regulatory compliance and cloud-native DevOps is an exceptionally thin talent pool.

### Total Issuing — The Pure-Play FinTech Premium

**Lever 1 — Infrastructure Consolidation Mandate:** "The $24B Worldpay stake sale in January 2026 means FIS is rationalizing infrastructure that was built to support a merchant acquiring business alongside banking technology. As a DevOps Engineer, I'll be leading the infrastructure consolidation effort that makes FIS's Pure-Play FinTech focus operationally real — decommissioning Worldpay-era systems, migrating workloads, and building the deployment platform for Total Issuing. I'd like my compensation to reflect this transformation scope: $195,000-$200,000 base in New York with an RSU grant of $140,000-$160,000 over four years."

**Lever 2 — Total Issuing Platform Reliability:** "Total Issuing is FIS's flagship platform, and its reliability directly determines whether banks trust FIS with their card issuing and transaction processing. As the DevOps Engineer responsible for Total Issuing's deployment pipelines, monitoring, and incident response, I own the availability SLA for the most important product in FIS's Pure-Play FinTech portfolio. I'm asking for a $20,000-$25,000 signing bonus and a 15% on-call/reliability premium on base salary."

**Lever 3 — $500M Infrastructure Modernization:** "With $500M in incremental cash flow post-divestiture, FIS is investing heavily in infrastructure modernization — Kubernetes, IaC, observability, and CI/CD automation. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect the scale of this infrastructure investment: $120,000-$160,000 over four years, which is competitive with what Stripe and Adyen are offering DevOps engineers who can operate at financial services scale."

**Lever 4 — Compliance-Native Platform Engineering:** "FIS's $13.5B in acquisitions created infrastructure that must comply with PCI DSS, SOC 2, SOX, and banking regulations across dozens of jurisdictions. DevOps Engineers who can build compliant-by-default infrastructure — where security and compliance are baked into the deployment pipeline, not bolted on after — are exceptionally rare. I'd like a 10-15% premium over your standard DevOps offer to reflect this compliance-native skill set in service of the Pure-Play FinTech transformation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $200,000 base (New York) or $170,000 base (Jacksonville) with a $160,000 RSU grant over four years, a $25,000 signing bonus, and an on-call premium. Frame the role around infrastructure transformation, not maintenance — FIS is rebuilding its deployment platform for the Pure-Play FinTech era, and DevOps engineers leading this transformation command fintech-tier rates. Target 18-22% total comp increase over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $155,000 base (NYC) / $130,000 base (JAX) with at least $80,000 in RSUs. If base comp is constrained, negotiate for a Total Issuing reliability bonus of $15,000-$25,000 annually tied to uptime SLA achievement.
