### Security Engineer | Capital One Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $68B market cap TECH-FIRST bank + Cloud-native security on AWS at scale + McLean VA HQ + Post-2019-breach security investment is massive | Capital One cloud security is industry-leading | **CLOUD SECURITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| McLean VA (HQ) | $155K–$210K | $85K–$225K | 10–15% | $198K–$335K |
| New York City | $165K–$222K | $95K–$240K | 10–15% | $215K–$360K |
| San Francisco | $160K–$218K | $90K–$232K | 10–15% | $208K–$348K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Capital One's cybersecurity organization has been massively expanded and elevated since the 2019 data breach, making it one of the most well-funded and sophisticated security operations in financial services. Security Engineers build and maintain cloud security systems, identity platforms, threat detection, and security automation on AWS -- making Capital One one of the few major financial institutions defending an entirely cloud-native banking infrastructure. This creates unique security challenges and career-defining experience.

Compensation follows the tech model: base plus RSUs (4-year vest) plus bonus (10-15%). Security engineering compensation is at the upper end of Capital One's engineering bands, reflecting the strategic importance and scarcity of cloud security talent. Total comp is competitive with Big Tech security teams and cybersecurity vendors.

Competition comes from cloud security companies (CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks), Big Tech security teams, government agencies, and other banks. Capital One's advantage is the unique challenge of securing cloud-native banking infrastructure at scale.

**The Cloud Banking Security Premium**

Capital One's fully cloud-native infrastructure creates security challenges that are unique in financial services. Security engineers must protect banking data and transactions on public cloud (AWS), implement zero-trust architecture in a cloud environment, and build security automation that scales with cloud infrastructure. This combination of cloud security expertise and banking regulatory requirements (OCC, FFIEC, GLBA) creates a skill set that is extremely scarce and highly valued. Post-breach investments have also made Capital One's security program one of the most resourced in the industry, giving security engineers access to cutting-edge tools and techniques.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [CrowdStrike/Google/AWS] at $[X] total comp. Capital One's cloud security challenge is appealing, but I need the RSU component increased to $[target]."
2. **Security Impact:** "Securing cloud-native banking infrastructure for millions of customers is existentially important. This justifies an RSU grant of $[target]."
3. **Cloud Security Expertise:** "My experience with [AWS security/cloud-native security architecture/banking security compliance] is directly applicable and scarce. This commands $[X]."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested equity. A sign-on of $[40K-65K] would offset the forfeiture."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. I'm excited about Capital One's cloud security challenges. I have a competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Google] at $[W]K total comp. To choose Capital One, I'd need the RSU grant increased to $[Y+70K] and a sign-on of $50K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
