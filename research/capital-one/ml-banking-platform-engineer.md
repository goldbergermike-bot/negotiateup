### ML Banking Platform Engineer | Capital One Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $68B market cap TECH-FIRST bank + ML embedded in every product decision + McLean VA HQ + Comp competitive with Big Tech | Capital One is a technology company that happens to be a bank | **TECH-FIRST BANKING ML PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| McLean VA (HQ) | $165K–$220K | $100K–$250K | 10–15% | $210K–$360K |
| New York City | $175K–$230K | $110K–$260K | 10–15% | $225K–$380K |
| San Francisco | $170K–$225K | $105K–$255K | 10–15% | $218K–$370K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Capital One pioneered the use of machine learning in banking and remains the most technology-forward bank in the industry. ML Banking Platform Engineers build the ML infrastructure, feature platforms, model serving systems, and MLOps pipelines that power every major product decision -- from credit card underwriting and fraud detection to customer acquisition and pricing optimization. Capital One was the first major bank to go all-in on cloud (fully migrated to AWS), and its ML platform is among the most sophisticated in financial services.

Engineers hold Senior Engineer through Distinguished Engineer titles, with compensation structured similarly to Big Tech: competitive base salary plus meaningful RSU grants (typically vesting over 4 years) plus annual bonus (10-15%). This equity-heavy structure differentiates Capital One from traditional banks that rely on cash bonuses. Total compensation for ML platform engineers is competitive with Google, Amazon, and Meta, particularly when adjusted for McLean VA's lower cost of living compared to Bay Area or NYC.

Competition for ML platform talent comes from Big Tech (Google, Amazon, Meta), AI startups (OpenAI, Anthropic), hedge funds, and other banks. Capital One's advantage is the unique intersection of cutting-edge ML engineering with financial domain impact: few organizations offer the combination of Big Tech engineering culture, financial services scale, and the intellectual challenge of applying ML to consequential decisions about credit, risk, and financial health.

**Level Mapping:** ML Banking Platform Engineer at Capital One (Senior/Principal) = L5-L6 at Google, E5-E6 at Meta, SDE III-Principal at Amazon, VP/SVP at BofA/JPMorgan

**The Tech-First Banking ML Premium**

Capital One's identity as a technology company creates a compensation environment that is fundamentally different from traditional banks. The company benchmarks engineering compensation against Google, Amazon, and Meta -- not against JPMorgan or BofA. RSU grants are a core component of total comp, with refresh grants that can exceed initial grants for top performers. ML engineers working on the company's core ML platform have direct attribution to credit decisions that drive billions in revenue and loss prevention, giving hiring managers strong justification for above-band packages.

Capital One's investment in ML infrastructure is industry-leading for financial services. The ML platform team builds tools used by hundreds of data scientists and ML engineers across the company, including feature stores, model training pipelines, real-time inference systems, and model monitoring frameworks. Engineers who can build ML infrastructure at this scale -- combining systems engineering with ML expertise -- are among the most scarce and valuable professionals in the industry.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Tech Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Amazon/Meta] at $[X] total comp for an ML platform role. Capital One's ML-first banking approach is compelling, but I need the RSU component increased to $[target] to close the total comp gap."
2. **Revenue Impact:** "The ML platform I would build directly powers credit decisions, fraud detection, and pricing optimization -- collectively driving billions in revenue and loss prevention. This revenue attribution justifies an RSU grant of $[target] over four years."
3. **ML Infrastructure Scarcity:** "My experience building [ML platforms/feature stores/model serving infrastructure] at scale is directly applicable and commands $[X] at tech companies. I'd like the offer to reflect that market rate."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested equity at my current company. A sign-on bonus of $[40K-80K] would make the transition financially neutral."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs over four years, and the [Z]% bonus target. I'm genuinely excited about Capital One's ML-first approach to banking. I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon] at $[W]K total comp. To choose Capital One, I'd need the RSU grant increased from $[Y]K to $[Y+80K] and a sign-on bonus of $60K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target], which is my threshold. Below $[floor], the tech company offer is more compelling."
