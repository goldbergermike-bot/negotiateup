**Negotiation DNA**

Capital One was among the first banks to embed ML into every aspect of its operations. ML/AI Engineers build production systems that power credit underwriting, fraud detection (preventing billions in losses), customer personalization, pricing optimization, and conversational AI. Unlike traditional banks where ML is a support function, at Capital One ML models ARE the core business logic -- making ML engineers among the most strategically important roles in the company.

Compensation follows the tech model: base plus significant RSUs (4-year vest) plus bonus (10-15%). ML engineering compensation is 10-15% above SWE bands and competitive with Google, Amazon, and Meta ML teams. Capital One invests heavily in ML infrastructure, model governance, and responsible AI, creating a mature ML engineering environment.

Competition comes from Big Tech (Google, Meta, Apple), AI startups (OpenAI, Anthropic), and hedge funds (Two Sigma, D.E. Shaw). Capital One's advantage is the direct, measurable business impact of ML work: every model improvement translates to quantifiable revenue or loss prevention impact.

**Level Mapping:** ML/AI Engineer at Capital One (Senior/Principal) = L4-L5 at Google, E4-E5 at Meta, Applied Scientist at Amazon, VP/SVP at BofA/JPMorgan

**The ML Business Impact Premium**

ML engineers at Capital One have a level of business impact that is rare in the industry. Credit underwriting models directly determine who receives credit and at what price, fraud detection models prevent billions in losses, and marketing models optimize billions in customer acquisition spend. This direct revenue attribution gives ML engineers strong negotiation leverage: their work has clearly measurable financial impact, making it easy for hiring managers to justify above-band compensation. Capital One's responsible AI framework also provides ML engineers with experience in fairness, explainability, and model governance that is increasingly valuable across the industry.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Meta/Two Sigma] at $[X] total comp for an ML role. Capital One's ML-first approach is compelling, but I need the RSU component increased to $[target]."
2. **Revenue Impact:** "ML models I build would directly impact credit decisions driving billions in revenue. This justifies an RSU grant of $[target]."
3. **ML Engineering Expertise:** "My experience with [production ML systems/model serving/responsible AI] commands $[X] at tech companies. I'd like the offer to reflect that rate."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested equity. A sign-on of $[40K-70K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. I'm excited about Capital One's ML-first banking approach. I have a competing offer from [Google/Two Sigma] at $[W]K total comp. To choose Capital One, I'd need the RSU grant increased to $[Y+80K] and a sign-on of $55K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
