### Technical Program Manager | Capital One Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $68B market cap TECH-FIRST bank + TPMs coordinate tech-company-style programs + McLean VA HQ + Comp competitive with Big Tech TPMs | Capital One TPMs drive programs at tech-company velocity | **TECH-FIRST TPM PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| McLean VA (HQ) | $155K–$210K | $80K–$210K | 10–15% | $198K–$325K |
| New York City | $165K–$222K | $90K–$225K | 10–15% | $215K–$350K |
| San Francisco | $160K–$218K | $85K–$218K | 10–15% | $208K–$338K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Capital One coordinate complex technology programs within a company that operates with tech-company engineering practices. TPMs (Director or Senior Director titles) manage cloud migration programs, platform initiatives, regulatory technology projects, and cross-functional delivery across engineering, data science, and product teams. Capital One's agile, cloud-native environment means TPMs work at the velocity of tech companies rather than traditional banks.

Compensation follows the tech model: base plus RSUs (4-year vest) plus bonus (10-15%). TPM compensation is competitive with Google, Amazon, and Meta TPM roles, especially when adjusted for McLean VA's cost of living.

Competition comes from Big Tech (Google, Amazon, Meta), consulting firms, and other banks. Capital One's advantage is the tech-company TPM culture with financial services impact.

**Level Mapping:** TPM at Capital One (Director/Sr Director) = L5-L6 TPM at Google, E5-E6 TPM at Meta, Sr TPM-Principal TPM at Amazon, SVP/Director at BofA/JPMorgan

**The Tech-First TPM Premium**

TPMs at Capital One operate in a fundamentally different environment than their counterparts at traditional banks. Programs run on agile cadences, engineering teams practice continuous deployment, and decision-making is data-driven. This tech-company velocity means Capital One TPMs develop skills that are directly transferable to any tech company, creating strong career optionality. The financial services context adds unique complexity -- regulatory compliance, model governance, and audit requirements -- giving Capital One TPMs broader experience than pure-tech TPMs.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Amazon/Meta] at $[X] total comp for a TPM role. Capital One's tech culture is compelling, but I need the RSU component increased to $[target]."
2. **Program Scale:** "I'd manage programs impacting [X] engineering teams and [Y] in investment. This scope justifies an RSU grant of $[target]."
3. **Tech + Banking TPM Expertise:** "My experience managing programs in [tech/regulated environments] is directly applicable and scarce. This commands $[X]."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested equity. A sign-on of $[40K-65K] would offset the forfeiture."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. I'm excited about Capital One's tech-culture TPM role. I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon] at $[W]K total comp. To choose Capital One, I'd need the RSU grant increased to $[Y+60K] and a sign-on of $50K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
