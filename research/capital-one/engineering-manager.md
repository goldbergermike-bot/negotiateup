**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Capital One lead teams within a bank that operates with tech-company engineering culture. EMs (Director or Senior Director titles) build and lead teams that practice agile development, continuous deployment, and modern engineering practices on a fully cloud-native (AWS) platform. The EM role at Capital One is modeled on Big Tech management practices: EMs are expected to be technically credible, drive engineering excellence, and build high-performing teams that deliver at tech-company velocity.

Compensation follows the tech model: competitive base plus significant RSU grants (4-year vest) plus bonus (10-15%). EM compensation is competitive with Google, Amazon, and Meta, particularly when McLean VA's cost-of-living advantage is factored in. Capital One actively recruits engineering managers from Big Tech companies and benchmarks EM compensation against those firms.

Competition comes from Big Tech (Google, Amazon, Meta), fintech companies, and other banks. Capital One's advantage is the unique combination of tech-company culture and financial services impact: EMs build teams that apply cutting-edge engineering to consequential financial decisions.

**Level Mapping:** Engineering Manager at Capital One (Director/Sr Director) = L6-L7 at Google, M1-M2 at Meta, SDM-Principal SDM at Amazon, SVP/Director at BofA/JPMorgan

**The Tech-First Banking EM Premium**

Engineering management at Capital One is distinctive because the company genuinely operates as a technology company. EMs hire from the same talent pool as Google and Amazon, use the same engineering practices, and are evaluated on the same metrics (team velocity, technical debt reduction, talent development). This tech-company culture within a banking context provides EMs with a unique proposition: the engineering challenge and culture of Big Tech with the financial impact and stability of banking. Capital One's EM compensation reflects this positioning -- it benchmarks against tech companies, not other banks.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Amazon/Meta] at $[X] total comp for an EM role. Capital One's tech-first culture is compelling, but I need the RSU component increased to $[target]."
2. **Team Building Track Record:** "I've built teams at [company] with [X]% retention, [Y]x deployment improvement, and [Z]% engineering satisfaction. This leadership capability justifies Sr Director-level compensation."
3. **Tech-to-Banking Value:** "My Big Tech EM experience brings engineering practices and talent development approaches that Capital One values. This tech-culture-building capability justifies an RSU grant of $[target]."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested equity. A sign-on of $[50K-90K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. I'm excited about building tech-caliber engineering teams at Capital One. I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon] at $[W]K total comp. To choose Capital One, I'd need the RSU grant increased to $[Y+100K] and a sign-on of $70K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], the tech offer is more compelling."
