### Product Designer | Perplexity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | Answer Engine Pioneer | AEO Shift

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $168K-$210K | $155K-$275K | — | $207K-$279K |
| New York | $173K-$221K | $155K-$275K | — | $212K-$290K |
| Remote US | $151K-$189K | $155K-$275K | — | $190K-$258K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Perplexity are designing the post-search interface — the entirely new UX paradigm for how humans interact with AI-generated answers. This isn't traditional web design or even standard product design; you're inventing the interaction patterns for sourced AI answers, citation UI, follow-up question flows, and the visual language of trust in an AI-first information experience. At a $9B+ pre-IPO company, designers are shaping the product surface that millions of users see every day, and design decisions directly impact retention, Pro conversion, and user trust — the metrics that drive Perplexity's revenue and valuation growth.

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — The New Search**
Perplexity isn't a search engine — it's an Answer Engine. And I'm building the platform that makes Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) the new SEO. The shift from "10 blue links" to direct, sourced AI answers is the biggest disruption in information retrieval since Google. Every role at Perplexity — from engineering to design to product — is building the infrastructure of this paradigm shift. As a Product Designer, you are designing the interface through which the entire world will experience AI answers — the visual language of AEO. How citations look, how follow-up questions flow, how trust is communicated through design — these are all your decisions, and they define what "post-search" feels like for every user. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not joining a startup. I'm building the platform that replaces Google Search for the AI era. AEO is the new SEO, and Perplexity is defining it. My equity should reflect that I'm an architect of the most important shift in information access since 1998."

**Global Levers**
1. **Post-Search UX Pioneer Premium:** "I'm not redesigning an existing product — I'm inventing the UX paradigm for AI answers. The design patterns I create at Perplexity will define how the entire industry presents AI-generated information. That category-defining design work deserves equity at the top of the band — $250K+ over four years."
2. **Competing Design Offer:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Apple/Figma] at $195K base with liquid RSUs. Perplexity's design challenge is more exciting and impactful, but I need $205K+ base and $260K+ equity to offset the liquidity and brand premium of a public company."
3. **Retention & Conversion Impact:** "Design directly drives Perplexity's key business metrics: user retention, Pro subscription conversion, and trust. Every design decision I make on the answer UX has measurable revenue impact. I'd like my equity to reflect that my work isn't just aesthetic — it's a core driver of Perplexity's monetization."
4. **Signing Bonus for Portfolio Transition:** "I'm leaving behind [unvested equity/bonus] at my current company to join Perplexity. I'd like a $35K-$50K signing bonus to offset the financial cost of this transition and to reflect the urgency of filling this design role in Perplexity's growth phase."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm thrilled about the opportunity to design the post-search experience at Perplexity — this is the most important design challenge in information access right now. I'm currently weighing an offer from [Google/Apple] at $198K base with $240K liquid RSU/4yr. Perplexity's mission and the chance to invent entirely new UX patterns is what I want, but I need the comp to work: $208K base, $265K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. If we can hit $205K base with $255K+ equity, I'll commit immediately. My floor is $190K base — below that, the public company offer is too strong."
