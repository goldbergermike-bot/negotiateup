### Data Engineer | Perplexity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | Answer Engine Pioneer | AEO Shift

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $175K-$218K | $165K-$290K | — | $216K-$291K |
| New York | $180K-$229K | $165K-$290K | — | $221K-$301K |
| Remote US | $158K-$196K | $165K-$290K | — | $199K-$269K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Perplexity build and maintain the data infrastructure that feeds the answer engine — web crawling pipelines that ingest the entire internet, knowledge index systems that organize billions of documents for real-time retrieval, and data ingestion architectures that ensure Perplexity's answers reflect the most current information available. At a $9B+ pre-IPO company where answer freshness and source breadth are core competitive differentiators against Google, Data Engineers are the foundation of the product. Your pipelines determine how much of the web Perplexity can answer from, how fresh those answers are, and how quickly new sources can be integrated — all of which directly impact answer quality, user satisfaction, and competitive positioning.

**Level Mapping:** Perplexity Data Engineer = Google Data Engineer L4-L5 = Databricks Data Engineer = Snowflake Data Engineer = Meta Data Engineer (IC4-IC5)

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — The New Search**
Perplexity isn't a search engine — it's an Answer Engine. And I'm building the platform that makes Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) the new SEO. The shift from "10 blue links" to direct, sourced AI answers is the biggest disruption in information retrieval since Google. Every role at Perplexity — from engineering to design to product — is building the infrastructure of this paradigm shift. As a Data Engineer, you are building the data foundation that makes AEO possible — the web crawling, knowledge indexing, and real-time data ingestion systems that ensure Perplexity has access to the freshest, most comprehensive information on the internet. Without your pipelines, there are no answers. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not joining a startup. I'm building the platform that replaces Google Search for the AI era. AEO is the new SEO, and Perplexity is defining it. My equity should reflect that I'm an architect of the most important shift in information access since 1998."

**Global Levers**
1. **Knowledge Index Ownership:** "I'll be building and maintaining the knowledge index that Perplexity's answer engine retrieves from — billions of documents, real-time ingestion, and the data quality guarantees that ensure every answer is sourced from accurate, current information. That knowledge index is Perplexity's most valuable data asset, and the engineer who builds it should be compensated accordingly: $270K+ equity/4yr."
2. **Web Crawling Scale Premium:** "Perplexity's web crawling infrastructure is competing with Google's — I'll be building the pipelines that ingest and organize the web at a scale that only a handful of companies in the world operate at. That scale requires specialized expertise in distributed systems, data processing, and pipeline reliability that commands a premium."
3. **Competing Data Engineering Offer:** "I have a competing offer from [Databricks/Snowflake/Google] at $205K base with $260K liquid RSU/4yr. Perplexity's data engineering challenge — building the web-scale knowledge infrastructure for an answer engine — is more complex and impactful, but I need $215K+ base and $280K+ equity to offset the liquidity premium."
4. **Data Freshness as Competitive Moat:** "Answer freshness is one of Perplexity's top competitive differentiators against Google Search. My data pipelines determine how quickly new information is available in the knowledge index — every hour of latency I eliminate is a direct competitive advantage. I'd like a $35K-$45K signing bonus to reflect the strategic importance of this role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Perplexity's data engineering challenge — building web-scale crawling pipelines, knowledge indexes, and real-time ingestion systems that feed the answer engine — is the most exciting data infrastructure problem in tech. I'm weighing a [Databricks/Snowflake] offer at $208K base with $265K liquid RSU/4yr. Perplexity's pre-IPO upside and the chance to build the data foundation of the AEO era is compelling, but I need: $216K base, $282K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. If we can hit $212K base with $275K+ equity, I'll sign this week. My floor is $198K base — below that, the public-company liquidity wins."
