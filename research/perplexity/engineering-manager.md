### Engineering Manager | Perplexity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | Answer Engine Pioneer | AEO Shift

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $228K-$285K | $325K-$565K | — | $309K-$426K |
| New York | $235K-$299K | $325K-$565K | — | $316K-$440K |
| Remote US | $205K-$257K | $325K-$565K | — | $286K-$398K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Perplexity lead the teams that build the answer engine — you own the people, process, and technical execution for critical product areas like retrieval systems, inference infrastructure, answer generation, or the Perplexity Pro and Enterprise platforms. At a fast-scaling pre-IPO company valued at $9B+, EMs are force multipliers: you're hiring and retaining world-class engineers, setting team roadmaps that align with Perplexity's aggressive growth trajectory, and making the execution-level decisions that determine whether Perplexity can outpace Google in the AEO race. Your equity is structured to reflect this leverage — the best EMs at pre-IPO companies capture outsized returns by building the teams that define the company's technical ceiling.

**Level Mapping:** Perplexity EM = Google L5 EM = Anthropic EM = OpenAI EM = Meta M1

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — The New Search**
Perplexity isn't a search engine — it's an Answer Engine. And I'm building the platform that makes Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) the new SEO. The shift from "10 blue links" to direct, sourced AI answers is the biggest disruption in information retrieval since Google. Every role at Perplexity — from engineering to design to product — is building the infrastructure of this paradigm shift. As an Engineering Manager, you are building and leading the teams that make AEO a reality — hiring the engineers, setting the technical direction, and ensuring execution velocity on the systems that power every answer Perplexity delivers. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not joining a startup. I'm building the platform that replaces Google Search for the AI era. AEO is the new SEO, and Perplexity is defining it. My equity should reflect that I'm an architect of the most important shift in information access since 1998."

**Global Levers**
1. **Team-Building Leverage:** "As an EM at Perplexity, I'm not just managing a team — I'm building it. The engineers I hire and retain in the next 12 months will define Perplexity's technical capabilities for years. That team-building leverage deserves equity at the top of the EM band — $520K+ over four years — because the team I build is the company's competitive moat."
2. **Competing EM Offer Framing:** "I have a Google L5 EM offer at $260K base with $450K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. I also have interest from Anthropic at the EM level. To choose Perplexity's pre-IPO path, I need $278K+ base and $530K+ equity — the management challenge at Perplexity is harder and higher-stakes than at a mature company, and the comp should reflect that."
3. **Execution Velocity Premium:** "Perplexity is in a land-grab against Google, and execution speed is everything. I bring [X years] of experience scaling engineering teams at [Company] from [size] to [size] while shipping on aggressive timelines. That execution track record is exactly what Perplexity needs right now, and it's worth a premium."
4. **Headcount Commitment as Negotiation Lever:** "I'd like clarity on my team's headcount plan for the next 12 months. An EM's impact scales with team size — if I'm building a team from 4 to 12 engineers, that's a significantly different role than managing a stable team. I'd like the equity grant to reflect the expected team scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about leading an engineering team at Perplexity — building the answer engine that replaces traditional search is the most consequential product challenge in tech right now. I'm currently weighing a Google L5 EM offer at $265K base with $460K liquid RSU/4yr and a $75K signing bonus, plus Anthropic EM interest at $258K base. To commit to Perplexity, I need the pre-IPO package to decisively win: $280K base, $540K equity/4yr, and a $70K signing bonus. If we can hit $275K base with $520K+ equity, I'll sign this week. My floor is $255K base — below that, the liquidity premium of Google's offer is too strong to walk away from."
