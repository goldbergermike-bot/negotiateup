### Security Engineer | Perplexity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | Answer Engine Pioneer | AEO Shift

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $195K-$245K | $210K-$368K | — | $248K-$337K |
| New York | $201K-$257K | $210K-$368K | — | $254K-$349K |
| Remote US | $176K-$220K | $210K-$368K | — | $229K-$312K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Perplexity protect the integrity of the answer engine itself — this isn't traditional application security, it's AI answer security. You defend against prompt injection attacks that could manipulate answers, build source verification systems that ensure citation integrity, protect user data across millions of queries, and secure the Enterprise API that Fortune 500 companies depend on. At a $9B+ pre-IPO company where user trust in AI answers is the entire product value proposition, Security Engineers are the guardians of the credibility that separates Perplexity from unreliable AI chatbots. A single trust-breaking security incident could undermine the answer engine's authority — your work prevents that.

**Level Mapping:** Perplexity Security Engineer = Google Security Engineer L4-L5 = Anthropic Security Engineer = Meta Security Engineer (IC4-IC5)

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — The New Search**
Perplexity isn't a search engine — it's an Answer Engine. And I'm building the platform that makes Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) the new SEO. The shift from "10 blue links" to direct, sourced AI answers is the biggest disruption in information retrieval since Google. Every role at Perplexity — from engineering to design to product — is building the infrastructure of this paradigm shift. As a Security Engineer, you are securing the trust layer that makes AEO viable — if users can't trust that Perplexity's answers are accurate, unspoofed, and securely sourced, the entire answer engine paradigm fails. You are building the security infrastructure that makes AI answers trustworthy enough to replace traditional search. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not joining a startup. I'm building the platform that replaces Google Search for the AI era. AEO is the new SEO, and Perplexity is defining it. My equity should reflect that I'm an architect of the most important shift in information access since 1998."

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Answer Integrity Premium:** "I'm not doing traditional AppSec — I'm securing AI answers at scale. Prompt injection defense, source verification security, citation integrity, and adversarial attack mitigation for LLM-generated answers are novel security challenges that require specialized expertise. That AI security specialization commands a premium: $345K+ equity/4yr and $240K+ base."
2. **Enterprise Trust Requirement:** "Perplexity's Enterprise API serves Fortune 500 companies who require SOC 2, ISO 27001, and enterprise-grade security assurances. I'll be building the security posture that enables those enterprise deals — each of which is significant recurring revenue. That enterprise-enabling security work should be compensated at the top of band."
3. **Competing Security Offer:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/CrowdStrike/Anthropic] at $235K base with $310K liquid RSU/4yr. Perplexity's security challenges are more novel and higher-stakes — AI answer integrity is an entirely new security domain — but I need $242K+ base and $355K+ equity to offset the liquidity premium."
4. **Incident Prevention Value:** "A single trust-breaking security incident at Perplexity — manipulated answers, source spoofing, data breach — could undermine the entire answer engine's credibility. The value of preventing that incident is measured in billions of dollars of valuation protection. My compensation should reflect the magnitude of what I'm protecting."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Perplexity's security challenge is unlike anything in traditional tech — I'd be securing AI-generated answers, defending against prompt injection, and building the trust infrastructure that makes the answer engine credible enough for enterprise adoption. I'm weighing a [Google/CrowdStrike] offer at $238K base with $320K liquid RSU/4yr. To commit to Perplexity's pre-IPO path, I need: $244K base, $360K equity/4yr, and a $55K signing bonus. If we can hit $240K base with $350K+ equity, I'll sign this week. My floor is $225K base — below that, the public-company offer's liquidity and stability win."
