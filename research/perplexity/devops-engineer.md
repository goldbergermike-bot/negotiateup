### DevOps Engineer | Perplexity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | Answer Engine Pioneer | AEO Shift

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $178K-$222K | $175K-$310K | — | $222K-$300K |
| New York | $183K-$233K | $175K-$310K | — | $227K-$311K |
| Remote US | $160K-$200K | $175K-$310K | — | $204K-$278K |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Perplexity own the inference infrastructure and deployment pipelines that make low-latency AI answers possible at massive scale. Every answer Perplexity delivers requires orchestrating LLM inference, real-time web retrieval, source citation, and answer rendering in under two seconds — and you're the engineer making that possible across millions of daily queries. At a $9B+ pre-IPO company scaling faster than any product in the search/AI space, DevOps is the foundation that determines whether Perplexity's answer quality can survive 10x user growth. Your infrastructure decisions directly impact cost efficiency (inference is Perplexity's largest expense), reliability, and the user experience that drives retention and Pro conversion.

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — The New Search**
Perplexity isn't a search engine — it's an Answer Engine. And I'm building the platform that makes Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) the new SEO. The shift from "10 blue links" to direct, sourced AI answers is the biggest disruption in information retrieval since Google. Every role at Perplexity — from engineering to design to product — is building the infrastructure of this paradigm shift. As a DevOps Engineer, you are building the infrastructure backbone that makes AEO possible at scale — the inference serving, the deployment pipelines, the monitoring systems, and the cost-optimization frameworks that allow Perplexity to deliver AI answers faster and cheaper than any competitor. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not joining a startup. I'm building the platform that replaces Google Search for the AI era. AEO is the new SEO, and Perplexity is defining it. My equity should reflect that I'm an architect of the most important shift in information access since 1998."

**Global Levers**
1. **Inference Cost Optimization Leverage:** "Inference cost is Perplexity's single largest expense, and I'll be the engineer optimizing GPU utilization, model serving latency, and infrastructure cost per answer. Every percentage point I shave off inference cost directly improves Perplexity's unit economics and path to profitability. That cost-leverage role is worth $290K+ equity/4yr."
2. **Scale & Reliability Ownership:** "Perplexity is scaling from millions to hundreds of millions of queries. I'll be building the infrastructure that ensures every answer is delivered reliably, fast, and cost-effectively at 10x-100x current scale. At a pre-IPO company, the infrastructure engineer who keeps the product running through hyper-growth is irreplaceable — my equity should reflect that."
3. **Competing Infrastructure Offer:** "I have an offer from [AWS/Google Cloud/Anthropic] at $205K base with liquid RSUs and stability premium. To choose Perplexity's pre-IPO path, I need $218K+ base and $295K+ equity — the infrastructure challenges at Perplexity are harder and more impactful, and the comp should match."
4. **On-Call & Reliability Premium:** "I'll be carrying pager responsibility for the inference infrastructure that serves every Perplexity answer. On-call responsibility at a fast-scaling pre-IPO company is significantly more demanding than at a mature platform — I'd like a $35K-$50K signing bonus and top-of-band equity to reflect that additional commitment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Perplexity's infrastructure challenge — serving AI answers at sub-second latency while scaling 10x — is the most exciting DevOps problem in tech right now. I'm currently weighing offers from [AWS/Google SRE/Anthropic] at $208K base with $260K liquid RSU/4yr. Perplexity's pre-IPO upside is compelling, but I need the economics to close: $220K base, $300K equity/4yr, and a $45K signing bonus. If we can get to $215K base with $290K+ equity, I'll commit this week. My floor is $200K base — below that, the public-company stability premium wins."
