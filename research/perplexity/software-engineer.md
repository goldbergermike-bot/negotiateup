**Negotiation DNA**
Perplexity's Software Engineers are building the answer engine that is replacing traditional search — every feature you ship moves millions of users from "10 blue links" to direct, sourced AI answers. At a $9B+ valuation with $500M+ raised, Perplexity is the fastest-growing threat to Google Search, and SWEs here work on inference pipelines, answer generation, real-time retrieval, and product surfaces that define what post-search looks like. The pre-IPO equity is the core of your compensation story: Perplexity is growing faster than Google Search did at the same stage, and your shares reflect the upside of building the platform that makes Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) the new SEO.

**Level Mapping:** Perplexity SWE = Google L3-L4 = OpenAI SWE = Anthropic SWE = Meta E3-E4

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — The New Search**
Perplexity isn't a search engine — it's an Answer Engine. And I'm building the platform that makes Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) the new SEO. The shift from "10 blue links" to direct, sourced AI answers is the biggest disruption in information retrieval since Google. Every role at Perplexity — from engineering to design to product — is building the infrastructure of this paradigm shift. As a Software Engineer, you are writing the code that powers every answer Perplexity delivers — the retrieval logic, the inference serving, the product UX that makes AI answers feel effortless and trustworthy. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not joining a startup. I'm building the platform that replaces Google Search for the AI era. AEO is the new SEO, and Perplexity is defining it. My equity should reflect that I'm an architect of the most important shift in information access since 1998."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Acceleration:** "Perplexity is valued at $9B+ and growing faster than any company in the search/AI space. I'd like to increase my equity grant from $180K to $280K+ over four years — at this growth trajectory, pre-IPO shares are the most valuable part of my compensation, and I want to be meaningfully invested in the platform that's replacing Google Search."
2. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a competing offer from Google at L4 with $195K base and $250K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. Perplexity's mission is where I want to be, but I need the base at $210K+ to offset the liquidity risk of private shares and the stability premium of a public company."
3. **Answer Engine Impact Framing:** "Every line of code I write at Perplexity directly powers the answer engine that millions of users rely on. This isn't incremental feature work at a mature company — I'm building the core infrastructure of the AEO paradigm. My compensation should reflect that I'm an early architect, not a late joiner."
4. **Signing Bonus for Liquidity Bridge:** "Since Perplexity's equity is pre-IPO and illiquid, I'd like a $40K-$60K signing bonus to bridge the gap between your offer and the liquid equity I'd receive at a public company. This lets me commit fully to Perplexity without the financial friction of illiquid compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm genuinely excited about Perplexity's answer engine vision and the chance to build the platform that's making AEO the new SEO. I'm currently weighing an offer from [Google/Anthropic] at $200K base with $260K equity/4yr in liquid stock. Perplexity's pre-IPO upside is compelling, but I need the economics to work: I'm looking for $215K base, $290K equity/4yr, and a $50K signing bonus to offset the liquidity difference. If we can get to $210K base with enhanced equity, I'm ready to sign this week. My walk-away floor is $195K base — below that, the public-company offer's liquidity advantage is too significant to leave on the table."
