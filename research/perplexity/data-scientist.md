### Data Scientist | Perplexity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | Answer Engine Pioneer | AEO Shift

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K-$232K | $200K-$350K | — | $235K-$320K |
| New York | $191K-$244K | $200K-$350K | — | $241K-$330K |
| Remote US | $167K-$209K | $200K-$350K | — | $217K-$296K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Perplexity measure and optimize the core quality metrics that determine whether the answer engine is actually better than traditional search — answer accuracy, citation correctness, source reliability, user satisfaction, and the behavioral signals that reveal whether users trust Perplexity enough to abandon Google. At a $9B+ pre-IPO company where "answer quality" is the entire product moat, Data Scientists are the feedback loop that keeps the answer engine improving. Your analysis directly informs model tuning, product decisions, and the metrics that investors use to evaluate Perplexity's trajectory toward IPO.

**Level Mapping:** Perplexity Data Scientist = Google DS L4-L5 = Meta DS (IC4-IC5) = Anthropic Data Scientist

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — The New Search**
Perplexity isn't a search engine — it's an Answer Engine. And I'm building the platform that makes Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) the new SEO. The shift from "10 blue links" to direct, sourced AI answers is the biggest disruption in information retrieval since Google. Every role at Perplexity — from engineering to design to product — is building the infrastructure of this paradigm shift. As a Data Scientist, you are defining the metrics and measurement frameworks that determine whether AEO is actually working — your analysis of answer quality, citation accuracy, and user satisfaction is the quantitative foundation of the entire answer engine's improvement cycle. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not joining a startup. I'm building the platform that replaces Google Search for the AI era. AEO is the new SEO, and Perplexity is defining it. My equity should reflect that I'm an architect of the most important shift in information access since 1998."

**Global Levers**
1. **Answer Quality Measurement Ownership:** "I'll be defining and measuring the metrics that determine whether Perplexity's answers are trustworthy — citation accuracy, source quality, factual correctness, and user satisfaction. These metrics aren't just internal dashboards; they're the signals that drive investor confidence, user retention, and competitive positioning against Google. That measurement ownership is worth $320K+ equity/4yr."
2. **Competing Offer from Tech/AI Company:** "I have a Google DS offer at L4 with $210K base and $280K liquid RSU/4yr. Perplexity's data science challenge — measuring answer quality for an entirely new product category — is more impactful, but I need $228K+ base and $330K+ equity to offset the liquidity and stability premium."
3. **Experimentation Framework Impact:** "I'll be building the A/B testing and experimentation frameworks that determine which model improvements, UX changes, and ranking adjustments actually improve answer quality. At a company shipping as fast as Perplexity, the experimentation infrastructure I build will accelerate every team's iteration speed."
4. **Signing Bonus for Illiquidity Offset:** "Since Perplexity's equity is pre-IPO and illiquid, I'd like a $40K-$55K signing bonus to bridge the compensation gap in Year 1 between your offer and public-company alternatives with liquid equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Perplexity's challenge — measuring and optimizing answer quality for the platform that's replacing search — is the most interesting data science problem in tech right now. I'm weighing a Google DS offer at $215K base with $290K liquid RSU/4yr and a Meta offer at similar levels. Perplexity's pre-IPO upside is compelling, but I need the economics to work: $230K base, $340K equity/4yr, and a $45K signing bonus. If we can reach $225K base with $325K+ equity, I'll sign this week. My floor is $210K base — below that, the public-company liquidity is too valuable to leave."
