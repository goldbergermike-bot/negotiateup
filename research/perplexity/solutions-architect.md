| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

| San Francisco | $182K-$228K | $170K-$298K | — | $225K-$302K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Perplexity are the technical bridge between the answer engine platform and the enterprise customers, publishers, and API partners who are integrating AEO into their own products and workflows. You design the architectures that bring Perplexity's Enterprise API into Fortune 500 companies, build the technical relationships with publisher partners who are adapting their content strategy for the AEO era, and ensure that every enterprise deployment delivers the same answer quality and performance that consumer users expect. At a $9B+ pre-IPO company where Enterprise API and publisher partnerships are critical revenue growth drivers, Solutions Architects are directly accelerating the deals that fund Perplexity's path to IPO.

**Level Mapping:** Perplexity Solutions Architect = Google Cloud SA L5 = AWS Solutions Architect (Senior) = Anthropic Solutions Engineer

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — The New Search**
Perplexity isn't a search engine — it's an Answer Engine. And I'm building the platform that makes Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) the new SEO. The shift from "10 blue links" to direct, sourced AI answers is the biggest disruption in information retrieval since Google. Every role at Perplexity — from engineering to design to product — is building the infrastructure of this paradigm shift. As a Solutions Architect, you are the person bringing AEO to the enterprise — designing the integrations that allow businesses and publishers to build on Perplexity's answer engine platform. You are translating the AEO paradigm shift into concrete architectural patterns that enterprises can adopt. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not joining a startup. I'm building the platform that replaces Google Search for the AI era. AEO is the new SEO, and Perplexity is defining it. My equity should reflect that I'm an architect of the most important shift in information access since 1998."

**Global Levers**
1. **Enterprise Revenue Acceleration:** "As a Solutions Architect, I directly enable the enterprise deals that drive Perplexity's revenue growth. Every Enterprise API deployment I architect is recurring revenue that strengthens the company's IPO narrative. That revenue-enabling role is worth $280K+ equity/4yr — I'm not just solving technical problems, I'm closing business."
2. **Publisher Partnership Technical Ownership:** "The publisher partnership ecosystem is critical to Perplexity's content strategy and AEO platform. I'll be the technical lead designing how publishers integrate with and benefit from the answer engine, which directly impacts Perplexity's content quality and partner revenue. That strategic role deserves top-of-band compensation."
3. **Competing Cloud/AI SA Offer:** "I have a competing offer from [Google Cloud/AWS/Snowflake] at $215K base with $260K liquid RSU/4yr. To choose Perplexity's pre-IPO path, I need $225K+ base and $285K+ equity — the enterprise challenge at Perplexity is more complex and higher-impact than at a mature cloud provider."
4. **Signing Bonus for Client Relationship Transfer:** "I'm bringing [X years] of enterprise relationships and domain expertise from [current company]. Those relationships have direct value to Perplexity's enterprise pipeline. I'd like a $40K-$55K signing bonus to reflect the client knowledge and trust I'm bringing to this role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about bringing Perplexity's answer engine to the enterprise — designing the architectures that make AEO work for Fortune 500 companies and publisher partners. I'm currently weighing an offer from [Google Cloud/AWS] at $218K base with $270K liquid RSU/4yr. Perplexity's enterprise growth trajectory and the chance to define an entirely new category of enterprise AI integration is what I want, but the comp needs to match: $226K base, $290K equity/4yr, and a $48K signing bonus. If we can hit $222K base with $280K+ equity, I'll sign immediately. My floor is $205K base — below that, the public-company offer's stability wins."
