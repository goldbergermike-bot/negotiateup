### ML/AI Engineer | Perplexity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | Answer Engine Pioneer | AEO Shift | **+20-35% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $218K-$272K | $325K-$565K | — | $299K-$413K |
| New York | $225K-$286K | $325K-$565K | — | $306K-$427K |
| Remote US | $196K-$245K | $325K-$565K | — | $277K-$386K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Perplexity are the core builders of the answer generation models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and citation ML that make the answer engine work. You train and optimize the models that generate answers, build the retrieval systems that find the right sources, and develop the ML pipelines that ensure citations are accurate and trustworthy. At a $9B+ pre-IPO company founded by former Google and OpenAI researchers, ML/AI Engineers are the highest-value hires — your models are the product. The +20-35% Agentic AI Premium reflects the market reality that ML/AI engineers with RAG, agentic reasoning, and answer generation expertise are the scarcest talent in tech, and every major AI company is competing for them.

**Level Mapping:** Perplexity ML/AI Engineer = Google ML Engineer L5-L6 = OpenAI Research Engineer = Anthropic ML Engineer = Meta ML Engineer (E5-E6)

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — The New Search**
Perplexity isn't a search engine — it's an Answer Engine. And I'm building the platform that makes Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) the new SEO. The shift from "10 blue links" to direct, sourced AI answers is the biggest disruption in information retrieval since Google. Every role at Perplexity — from engineering to design to product — is building the infrastructure of this paradigm shift. As an ML/AI Engineer, you are building the intelligence that powers AEO — the answer generation models, the retrieval-augmented generation systems, and the citation ML that make Perplexity's answers accurate, sourced, and trustworthy. You are literally the builder of the AI that replaces Google Search. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not joining a startup. I'm building the platform that replaces Google Search for the AI era. AEO is the new SEO, and Perplexity is defining it. My equity should reflect that I'm an architect of the most important shift in information access since 1998."

**Global Levers**
1. **Agentic AI Premium (20-35%):** "ML/AI engineers with RAG, agentic reasoning, and answer generation expertise are the scarcest talent in the industry. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Meta FAIR are all competing for engineers with my skill set at a 20-35% premium over standard SWE compensation. My base should be $260K+ and equity $520K+ to reflect the market reality that agentic AI talent commands the highest premiums in tech."
2. **Model-as-Product Leverage:** "At Perplexity, the ML models are the product — there's no product without the models I build and optimize. My work on answer generation, RAG pipelines, and citation ML directly determines Perplexity's answer quality, which is the single metric that determines user retention, Pro conversion, and enterprise adoption. That product-defining leverage deserves top-of-band equity at $550K+/4yr."
3. **Competing AI Lab Offers:** "I have competing offers from [OpenAI/Anthropic/Google DeepMind] with base salaries of $260K+ and equity packages of $500K+. To choose Perplexity, the pre-IPO upside must decisively beat the alternatives: $270K+ base and $550K+ equity. The answer engine challenge is uniquely compelling, but the talent market for ML engineers is extremely competitive."
4. **Research Publication & IP Value:** "My prior work on [specific ML area — RAG, retrieval, answer generation, citation systems] has been published at [conferences] and directly applies to Perplexity's core technical challenges. I'm bringing not just engineering skill but domain-specific research IP that accelerates Perplexity's ML roadmap. That research premium should be reflected in my equity grant."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply excited about building the ML systems that power Perplexity's answer engine — RAG, answer generation, and citation ML are exactly at the intersection of my expertise and passion. I'm currently weighing offers from [OpenAI at $265K base / $520K equity] and [Anthropic at $258K base / $480K pre-IPO equity]. Perplexity's answer engine vision is the most compelling product challenge in AI right now, but the comp must reflect the agentic AI premium: $272K base, $555K equity/4yr, and a $80K signing bonus. If we can reach $265K base with $540K+ equity, I'll commit immediately. My floor is $248K base — below that, the competing AI lab offers are too strong to walk away from. The 20-35% agentic AI premium isn't optional; it's the market rate for ML engineers who can build the systems that make answer engines work."
