### Product Manager | Marvell Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Custom Silicon & AI Infrastructure | Celestial AI Acquisition | Standard Band

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $155K–$195K | $110K–$190K | 12–18% | $212K–$292K |
| Boise | $139K–$175K | $95K–$165K | 12–18% | $188K–$258K |
| Remote US | $147K–$185K | $100K–$178K | 12–18% | $198K–$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Marvell define the roadmap, customer requirements, and go-to-market strategy for custom silicon products serving hyperscaler, enterprise, and carrier customers. With the Celestial AI acquisition, Marvell now has an entirely new product category — photonics-based optical interconnect for AI data centers — that requires PMs who can translate deep technical capabilities into customer-facing value propositions for the world's largest cloud providers. Candidates should position themselves as the bridge between Marvell's silicon engineering teams and hyperscaler customers who are spending tens of billions on AI infrastructure.

**Celestial AI Acquisition — The 10x Bandwidth Premium**

Marvell's acquisition of Celestial AI secured photonics-based interconnect technology that delivers a 10x bandwidth jump for data center connectivity — the bottleneck technology that determines how fast AI training clusters can communicate. As a Product Manager, you own the product strategy that turns this technology into revenue. You define the product requirements for hyperscaler customers, prioritize the engineering roadmap, set pricing strategy for a product with no direct competitor, and manage the launch that determines whether Marvell's largest acquisition generates returns. This is a bet-the-company investment in AI infrastructure, and the PM is the person who decides which customer problems to solve first, how to package the technology, and when to ship. Your negotiation leverage comes from the fact that Marvell needs PMs who deeply understand both semiconductor product lifecycles and hyperscaler procurement — a rare combination. Frame your comp ask around the revenue impact: if the optical interconnect product captures even 10% of the addressable market, it represents billions in new revenue for Marvell, and you are the PM steering that outcome.

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue Ownership Framing:** "I'd be the PM owning the product strategy for Marvell's optical interconnect platform — a new product category with multi-billion-dollar TAM. My roadmap decisions directly determine revenue capture from the Celestial AI acquisition."
2. **Hyperscaler Relationship Capital:** "I bring existing relationships with procurement and infrastructure teams at [AWS/Google/Azure]. These relationships accelerate Marvell's time-to-design-win for the optical interconnect product by 6–12 months."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a PM offer from Nvidia at $270K total comp for their networking product line. Marvell's optical interconnect opportunity is more greenfield and strategically exciting, but the comp needs to reflect the scope — I'm defining an entirely new product category."
4. **Equity Upside Alignment:** "The optical interconnect product has the potential to meaningfully move Marvell's stock price. I'd like a larger RSU grant — $160K over 4 years — to align my compensation with the long-term value I'll help create."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply excited about defining the product strategy for Marvell's optical interconnect platform — it's a rare chance to build a new product category from scratch at a company with the silicon foundation to win. I have a competing offer from Nvidia at $270K total comp. My target to join Marvell is $285K total comp, structured as $180K base, $170K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus. I'd accept $265K as my floor if the RSU grant is front-loaded and includes $35K annual refreshers. This reflects the revenue-defining nature of the PM role on the Celestial AI optical interconnect product."
