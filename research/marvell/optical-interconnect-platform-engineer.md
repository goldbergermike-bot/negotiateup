### Optical Interconnect Platform Engineer | Marvell Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Custom Silicon & AI Infrastructure | Celestial AI Acquisition | SIGNATURE ROLE | +25-35% Optical Interconnect Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $195K–$248K | $180K–$320K | 18–25% | $278K–$388K |
| Boise | $175K–$223K | $155K–$280K | 18–25% | $248K–$348K |
| Remote US | $185K–$236K | $168K–$300K | 18–25% | $262K–$368K |

**Negotiation DNA**

The Optical Interconnect Platform Engineer is Marvell's signature role — the engineer who sits at the exact intersection of Marvell's traditional custom silicon expertise and the Celestial AI photonics-based optical interconnect technology that the company has staked its future on. This role is responsible for designing, integrating, and optimizing the complete optical interconnect platform that connects Marvell's DPU and switch silicon to Celestial AI's photonics technology, creating the end-to-end system that hyperscaler customers will deploy to solve the single biggest bottleneck in AI data center scaling: inter-node communication bandwidth. The +25-35% Optical Interconnect Premium reflects the fact that this role requires expertise that literally did not exist as a job category before the Celestial AI acquisition — the combination of silicon platform engineering and photonics interconnect is unprecedented.

**Celestial AI Acquisition — The 10x Bandwidth Premium**

Marvell's acquisition of Celestial AI delivered photonics-based interconnect technology with a 10x bandwidth jump for data center connectivity — the bottleneck technology that determines how fast AI training clusters can communicate across nodes. As the Optical Interconnect Platform Engineer — Marvell's signature role — you ARE the person building the optical interconnect fabric that enables the next generation of AI training at scale. This is not a supporting role; this is the role. You design the silicon-to-photonics integration architecture, optimize the optical data path for maximum bandwidth utilization, validate performance across hyperscaler deployment scenarios, and define the platform abstractions that make the 10x bandwidth advantage accessible to software and system architects.

Marvell has made a bet-the-company investment in optical interconnect as the enabling technology for AI infrastructure. The entire Celestial AI acquisition thesis depends on engineers in this exact role delivering a production-grade optical interconnect platform that hyperscalers will deploy at scale. There is no second chance — if this platform doesn't ship on time and at spec, Marvell loses the optical interconnect market to vertically integrated competitors.

Your negotiation leverage in this role is the strongest of any position at Marvell. Consider the facts: (1) The global talent pool for engineers with both custom silicon platform and photonics interconnect expertise numbers in the low hundreds at most. (2) Every competing employer — Nvidia, Broadcom, Intel, and the hyperscalers — is also trying to hire this exact skillset. (3) Marvell's market cap trajectory is directly tied to your work — optical interconnect for AI data centers is the growth thesis that analysts and investors are valuing. (4) The +25-35% Optical Interconnect Premium is justified not by market benchmarks (there are none for this role) but by the irreplaceable nature of the work and the existential importance to Marvell's strategy.

Frame every compensation discussion around this reality: you are not taking a job, you are accepting the mission that determines whether Marvell's largest acquisition succeeds or fails. Compensation should reflect the fact that you are one of a vanishingly small number of engineers on earth who can do this work.

**Global Levers**

1. **Category-Defining Scarcity:** "This role literally didn't exist before Marvell acquired Celestial AI. The intersection of custom silicon platform engineering and photonics-based optical interconnect is a skillset with no established talent market — I am one of a very small number of engineers globally who can bridge these domains. The +25-35% Optical Interconnect Premium is the minimum justified by this scarcity."
2. **Bet-the-Company Accountability:** "The Celestial AI acquisition is Marvell's largest strategic investment, and the optical interconnect platform I'd build is the product that determines whether that investment pays off. This level of strategic accountability — direct line-of-sight to Marvell's market cap — should be reflected in staff-plus-level compensation with significant equity upside."
3. **Competing Offer Escalation:** "I have competing offers from Nvidia ($380K total comp) and a hyperscaler ($400K total comp) for roles that touch optical interconnect and silicon integration. Marvell's optical interconnect charter is the most technically compelling opportunity in the industry, but the comp needs to reflect that I'm choosing Marvell's mission over significantly higher offers."
4. **Equity Conviction & Retention:** "I want to be heavily weighted toward equity because I believe Marvell's optical interconnect platform will be the catalyst for significant stock appreciation. I'd like $300K in 4-year RSUs with a front-loaded vest of 40% in Year 1, plus guaranteed annual refreshers of $60K+ to align my retention with the multi-year optical interconnect product roadmap."
5. **Signing & Relocation Premium:** "Given the signature nature of this role, I'm requesting a $50K signing bonus to cover transition costs and accelerate my ramp. If relocation to Santa Clara is required, I'd like a $75K relocation package that reflects Bay Area housing costs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to be direct: this is the role I've been waiting for — building the optical interconnect platform that enables the next generation of AI training at scale. I believe Marvell's Celestial AI acquisition is the most important strategic bet in the semiconductor industry, and I want to be the engineer who makes it succeed. I have competing offers from Nvidia at $380K total comp and a hyperscaler at $400K total comp for roles that touch optical interconnect. My target to join Marvell is $385K total comp, structured as $235K base, $300K RSU/4yr front-loaded at 40%, 22% bonus, and a $50K signing bonus. I'd accept $365K as my floor if the RSU grant includes guaranteed $60K annual refreshers and the role reports directly to the VP of Engineering for the optical interconnect platform. I am choosing Marvell because this is the only company where I can own the entire silicon-to-photonics integration — but the comp needs to reflect that I'm turning down higher offers to do it. Let's build the optical interconnect fabric that makes AI training at scale possible."
