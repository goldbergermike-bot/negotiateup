### Data Scientist | Marvell Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Custom Silicon & AI Infrastructure | Celestial AI Acquisition | +5% Analytics Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $145K–$185K | $100K–$170K | 12–18% | $192K–$265K |
| Boise | $130K–$166K | $85K–$148K | 12–18% | $168K–$235K |
| Remote US | $137K–$175K | $92K–$158K | 12–18% | $180K–$250K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Marvell work at the intersection of semiconductor design and data-driven decision making — modeling silicon performance, optimizing yield, analyzing customer telemetry from deployed DPUs and switches, and building predictive models that inform product roadmap decisions. The Celestial AI acquisition has created new demand for data scientists who can analyze optical interconnect performance data, model bandwidth utilization across AI training clusters, and provide the analytical foundation for pricing and product strategy in an entirely new product category. Candidates should frame themselves as the quantitative backbone of Marvell's AI infrastructure strategy. (Source: Marvell 2025 10-K; semiconductor industry data science hiring trends; Glassdoor)

**Celestial AI Acquisition — The 10x Bandwidth Premium**

Marvell's acquisition of Celestial AI brought photonics-based interconnect technology delivering a 10x bandwidth jump for data center connectivity — the bottleneck that limits AI training cluster communication speed. As a Data Scientist, you provide the analytical infrastructure that guides Marvell's optical interconnect strategy: modeling performance characteristics of photonics-based interconnects at scale, analyzing customer deployment telemetry to optimize product iterations, building pricing models for a product category with no historical benchmark, and forecasting demand from hyperscaler customers investing hundreds of billions in AI infrastructure. This is a bet-the-company investment, and data-driven insights are what separate a successful product launch from a missed market window. Your negotiation leverage comes from the fact that Marvell needs data scientists who understand semiconductor performance modeling and can apply it to an entirely new technology domain — optical photonics interconnect. This cross-domain analytical expertise is exceptionally rare.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Domain Analytics Scarcity:** "I'd be applying semiconductor performance modeling to an entirely new domain — optical photonics interconnect. Data scientists with this cross-domain capability are extremely rare, and the insights I generate directly inform Marvell's optical interconnect product strategy."
2. **Pricing Strategy Impact:** "There's no historical pricing benchmark for photonics-based optical interconnect products. My analytical work on pricing models and demand forecasting directly impacts the revenue realization from Marvell's Celestial AI acquisition."
3. **Competing Offer Pressure:** "I have a data science offer from a hyperscaler at $250K total comp. Marvell's semiconductor data challenges are more analytically interesting, but the comp needs to be competitive with tech industry benchmarks."
4. **Tooling & Infrastructure Investment:** "I'd like Marvell to commit to data science infrastructure investment — cloud compute budget, tooling, and a clear career ladder to Senior/Staff Data Scientist within 2–3 years based on optical interconnect product impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the unique data science challenge of modeling optical interconnect performance for Marvell's Celestial AI platform — it's a rare opportunity to build the analytical foundation for an entirely new product category. I have a competing offer from [hyperscaler] at $250K total comp. My target to join Marvell is $258K total comp, structured as $170K base, $150K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus. I'd accept $240K as my floor if the role includes a clear path to Senior Data Scientist within 18 months and a $10K annual conference/training budget. This reflects the cross-domain analytical scarcity of semiconductor-plus-photonics data science."
