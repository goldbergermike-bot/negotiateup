**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Marvell create the interfaces, dashboards, and developer experiences that make complex semiconductor products accessible to hyperscaler infrastructure teams and enterprise customers. While Marvell is a hardware-first company, the growing importance of management planes, configuration tools, and customer-facing platforms for products like DPUs, switches, and the Celestial AI optical interconnect system has elevated design as a strategic function. Candidates should position themselves as the designers who translate deep silicon capabilities into intuitive experiences for the most demanding technical users on earth — hyperscaler infrastructure engineers.

**Celestial AI Acquisition — The 10x Bandwidth Premium**

Marvell's acquisition of Celestial AI delivered photonics-based interconnect technology with a 10x bandwidth jump for data center connectivity — the bottleneck technology that determines how fast AI training clusters communicate. As a Product Designer, you are designing the management interfaces, monitoring dashboards, and configuration experiences for Marvell's optical interconnect platform. Hyperscaler customers deploy these systems at massive scale across thousands of nodes — the quality of the management and observability UX directly determines adoption speed and customer satisfaction. This is a bet-the-company investment in AI infrastructure, and the design of the user-facing layer matters enormously when the underlying technology is this complex. Your negotiation leverage comes from the fact that semiconductor companies historically underinvest in design, and Marvell's move to invest in product design for the optical interconnect platform signals a strategic shift. Frame your role as the person who makes the 10x bandwidth advantage understandable, configurable, and monitorable for the engineers who operate the world's largest AI training clusters.

**Global Levers**

1. **Design Maturity Premium:** "Marvell is investing in product design as a strategic function for the first time around the optical interconnect platform. I'd be building the design practice — not just designing screens — and that foundational work commands a premium."
2. **Hyperscaler UX Expertise:** "I have experience designing infrastructure management tools for [hyperscaler/enterprise] customers. This domain expertise accelerates Marvell's time-to-adoption for the optical interconnect management plane."
3. **Competing Offer Baseline:** "I have a design offer from a SaaS company at $205K total comp. Marvell's optical interconnect design challenge is more technically interesting, but the comp needs to be competitive — semiconductor design salaries are rising to match software industry benchmarks."
4. **Equity Growth Story:** "Marvell's AI infrastructure thesis makes the equity component particularly compelling. I'd like an RSU grant of $100K over 4 years to align my compensation with the optical interconnect product launch timeline."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about designing the management and observability experience for Marvell's optical interconnect platform — it's a unique design challenge at the intersection of hardware and enterprise software. I have a competing offer at $205K total comp from a SaaS infrastructure company. My target to join Marvell is $210K total comp, structured as $145K base, $105K RSU/4yr, and 12% bonus. I'd accept $195K as my floor if the RSU grant is front-loaded to 30% in Year 1. This reflects the rarity of designers with infrastructure UX experience and the strategic importance of design to the Celestial AI product launch."
