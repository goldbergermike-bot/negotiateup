### Security Engineer | Marvell Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Custom Silicon & AI Infrastructure | Celestial AI Acquisition | +10% Security Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $152K–$195K | $110K–$190K | 12–18% | $202K–$282K |
| Boise | $136K–$175K | $94K–$165K | 12–18% | $178K–$250K |
| Remote US | $144K–$185K | $102K–$178K | 12–18% | $190K–$266K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Marvell work at the intersection of hardware security, firmware security, and supply chain integrity — protecting custom silicon products that operate in the most security-sensitive environments on earth, from hyperscaler data centers to defense and telecommunications infrastructure. Semiconductor security is a fundamentally different discipline from application security: vulnerabilities in silicon are permanent, firmware exploits can compromise entire data center fleets, and supply chain compromises have national security implications. The Celestial AI acquisition adds optical interconnect security to the scope — a new attack surface that requires novel security architectures for photonics-based data transmission.

**Celestial AI Acquisition — The 10x Bandwidth Premium**

Marvell's acquisition of Celestial AI delivered photonics-based interconnect technology with a 10x bandwidth jump for data center connectivity — the bottleneck technology that determines how fast AI training clusters communicate. As a Security Engineer, you are responsible for securing an entirely new technology layer: photonics-based optical interconnect. This means designing security architectures for optical data transmission, ensuring the integrity of photonics firmware against supply chain and side-channel attacks, and meeting the compliance requirements of hyperscaler customers who will deploy optical interconnect in their most sensitive AI training environments. This is a bet-the-company investment in AI infrastructure, and security is a gate — no hyperscaler will deploy optical interconnect without rigorous security validation. Your negotiation leverage comes from the fact that optical interconnect security is an emerging field with virtually no experienced practitioners. You are not filling an existing role — you are defining a new security discipline at the intersection of photonics, firmware, and data center infrastructure.

**Global Levers**

1. **Novel Attack Surface Expertise:** "I'd be defining the security architecture for photonics-based optical interconnect — a completely new attack surface with no established playbook. This is a greenfield security discipline, and the person who defines it commands a premium."
2. **Compliance Gate Function:** "No hyperscaler will deploy Marvell's optical interconnect without my security validation. I am the gate between Celestial AI technology and customer revenue — my work directly enables bookings."
3. **Competing Offer Pressure:** "I have a security engineering offer from a hyperscaler at $265K total comp. Marvell's optical interconnect security challenge is more technically novel, but the comp needs to reflect the scope — I'm defining a new security discipline, not maintaining an existing one."
4. **Clearance & Compliance Premium:** "My existing security clearances and compliance expertise (SOC2, FedRAMP, FIPS) are directly relevant to Marvell's defense and government customers for optical interconnect products. This clearance portability should be reflected in a $10K–$15K premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about defining the security architecture for Marvell's optical interconnect platform — it's a unique opportunity to build a new security discipline from scratch for a technology that every hyperscaler will depend on. I have a competing offer from [hyperscaler] at $265K total comp for a senior security role. My target to join Marvell is $275K total comp, structured as $182K base, $170K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus. I'd accept $258K as my floor if the role includes a security research budget and the RSU vest is front-loaded to 35% in Year 1. This reflects the greenfield nature of optical interconnect security and the compliance-gate function I'll serve for Marvell's hyperscaler customers."
