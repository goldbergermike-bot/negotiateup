**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Marvell lead teams of 8–15 engineers building the firmware, software, and platform layers for Marvell's custom silicon products — DPUs, switches, PHYs, and now the Celestial AI optical interconnect platform. This role uniquely combines people leadership with deep technical context in semiconductor software, requiring managers who can recruit, retain, and align scarce silicon software talent with Marvell's most strategic product bets. The Celestial AI acquisition has intensified the demand for engineering managers who can stand up entirely new teams focused on optical interconnect software integration, making this a high-leverage hire for Marvell's leadership.

**Celestial AI Acquisition — The 10x Bandwidth Premium**

Marvell's acquisition of Celestial AI brought photonics-based interconnect technology with a 10x bandwidth jump for data center connectivity — the bottleneck technology that determines AI training cluster communication speed. As an Engineering Manager, you are the leader responsible for building and scaling the team that integrates Celestial AI's optical interconnect into Marvell's production silicon platform. This means recruiting engineers with an exceptionally rare skillset (silicon software + optical interconnect), setting technical direction for a product category that didn't exist two years ago, and delivering on aggressive timelines demanded by hyperscaler customers. Marvell's bet-the-company investment in AI infrastructure means your team's output directly determines whether Marvell wins or loses the optical interconnect market. Use this in negotiation by framing yourself as the leader who will build the team that turns Marvell's most important acquisition into shipped product. Engineering managers who can recruit and retain optical interconnect software talent are as scarce as the engineers themselves — demand compensation that reflects this multiplier effect.

**Global Levers**

1. **Team-Building Multiplier:** "I'll be building the team that integrates Celestial AI's optical interconnect into Marvell's production platform. My ability to recruit and retain scarce optical interconnect software engineers directly multiplies the ROI on Marvell's most important acquisition."
2. **Competing Management Offers:** "I have an EM offer from Broadcom at $340K total comp managing their networking software team. Marvell's optical interconnect charter is more compelling, but the comp needs to reflect the scope — I'm standing up a new team, not managing a steady-state org."
3. **Headcount Commitment:** "I'd like clarity on headcount growth for the optical interconnect software team — a guaranteed 5+ net-new hires in my first 12 months would signal Marvell's commitment and help me ramp the team to deliver on the Celestial AI integration timeline."
4. **Equity for Retention Alignment:** "Engineering managers in semiconductor software have a 2.5-year median tenure. I'd like a front-loaded RSU vest with 40% in Year 1 plus annual refreshers of $40K+ to align my retention incentives with the Celestial AI product delivery timeline."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited to build the engineering team that turns Marvell's Celestial AI acquisition into a shipped product. I have a competing offer from Broadcom at $340K total comp for an EM role on their networking stack. My target to join Marvell is $360K total comp, structured as $215K base, $250K RSU/4yr front-loaded, and 18% bonus. I'd accept $338K as my floor if the headcount plan includes 5+ net-new hires in Year 1 and the RSU vest is 40% front-loaded. This reflects the unique challenge of recruiting and retaining optical interconnect software talent in a market where Nvidia, Broadcom, and the hyperscalers are all competing for the same engineers."
