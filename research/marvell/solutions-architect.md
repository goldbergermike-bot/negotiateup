### Solutions Architect | Marvell Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Custom Silicon & AI Infrastructure | Celestial AI Acquisition | +5% Customer-Facing Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $145K–$185K | $100K–$170K | 12–18% | $192K–$265K |
| Boise | $130K–$166K | $85K–$148K | 12–18% | $168K–$235K |
| Remote US | $137K–$175K | $92K–$158K | 12–18% | $180K–$250K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Marvell serve as the technical bridge between Marvell's silicon products and the world's largest hyperscaler and enterprise customers — designing reference architectures, leading proof-of-concept deployments, and driving design wins for DPUs, switches, PHYs, and now optical interconnect platforms. This is a revenue-critical, customer-facing role that requires deep silicon knowledge combined with the ability to architect complete data center solutions for AWS, Google, Microsoft, and Meta. The Celestial AI acquisition has created an entirely new solutions architecture discipline around optical interconnect deployment, making this role a linchpin for Marvell's go-to-market strategy.

**Celestial AI Acquisition — The 10x Bandwidth Premium**

Marvell's acquisition of Celestial AI delivered photonics-based interconnect technology with a 10x bandwidth jump for data center connectivity — the bottleneck technology that limits AI training cluster communication speed. As a Solutions Architect, you are the person who takes this 10x bandwidth advantage and translates it into deployable architectures for hyperscaler customers. You design the reference architectures that show Google, AWS, and Microsoft how to integrate Marvell's optical interconnect into their AI training clusters, lead proof-of-concept deployments that validate performance claims, and drive the design wins that convert Marvell's technology advantage into contracted revenue. This is a bet-the-company investment in AI infrastructure, and solutions architects are the revenue tip-of-spear — every design win you drive directly validates the Celestial AI acquisition thesis. Your negotiation leverage is amplified by the fact that optical interconnect solutions architecture is a brand-new discipline: there are no experienced practitioners, so every candidate is essentially a pioneer. Demand compensation that reflects both the customer-facing pressure and the technical novelty of this role.

**Global Levers**

1. **Design Win Revenue Impact:** "Every optical interconnect design win I drive represents tens of millions in contracted revenue. My solutions architecture work directly converts Marvell's Celestial AI technology advantage into bookings."
2. **Hyperscaler Relationships:** "I bring existing technical relationships with infrastructure teams at [AWS/Google/Azure/Meta]. These relationships accelerate proof-of-concept timelines and increase design win probability for the optical interconnect platform."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a solutions architect offer from AWS at $255K total comp. Marvell's optical interconnect challenge is more technically differentiated, but the comp needs to reflect the customer-facing scope and revenue impact."
4. **Travel & Customer Engagement Budget:** "The optical interconnect SA role requires significant customer site engagement. I'd like a $15K annual travel and customer engagement budget plus flexibility for remote work between customer visits."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about being the solutions architect who translates Marvell's 10x optical interconnect bandwidth advantage into deployable architectures for hyperscaler customers. I have a competing offer from AWS at $255K total comp for a senior SA role. My target to join Marvell is $260K total comp, structured as $172K base, $155K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus. I'd accept $245K as my floor if the role includes a $15K annual travel budget and the RSU vest is front-loaded. This reflects the revenue-critical nature of driving optical interconnect design wins at the world's largest cloud providers."
