### Software Engineer | Marvell Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Custom Silicon & AI Infrastructure | Celestial AI Acquisition | Standard Band

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $130K–$165K | $80K–$140K | 10–15% | $168K–$228K |
| Boise | $115K–$148K | $65K–$120K | 10–15% | $145K–$198K |
| Remote US | $120K–$155K | $70K–$130K | 10–15% | $155K–$212K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Marvell's Software Engineers are foundational to the company's custom silicon and data infrastructure platform, writing firmware, drivers, and SDK tooling that powers the next generation of AI-optimized chips. With the Celestial AI acquisition bringing photonics-based optical interconnect in-house, even entry-level software roles now touch the most critical bottleneck technology in AI data center design. Candidates should position themselves as builders of the software layer that makes Marvell's 10x bandwidth advantage usable by hyperscaler customers.

**Celestial AI Acquisition — The 10x Bandwidth Premium**

Marvell's acquisition of Celestial AI gave the company exclusive access to photonics-based interconnect technology that delivers a 10x bandwidth jump for data center connectivity — the single biggest bottleneck preventing AI training clusters from scaling. As a Software Engineer, you are building the firmware, driver stacks, and control plane software that turns this raw optical interconnect hardware into a production-grade product for hyperscaler customers like AWS, Google, and Microsoft. This is a bet-the-company investment: Marvell is staking its future on owning the optical interconnect fabric that enables the next generation of AI training at scale. Use this in negotiation by framing your role as directly enabling Marvell's most strategic technology bet. Every software layer you build accelerates time-to-market for a product category where Marvell has zero direct competitors at this bandwidth level. Demand compensation that reflects the strategic weight of this work — you are not writing generic firmware, you are building the software that makes 10x bandwidth real.

**Global Levers**

1. **Celestial AI Scarcity:** "I'd be working on the software stack for the Celestial AI optical interconnect platform — a technology with no direct competitor at this bandwidth level. My firmware and driver work directly determines how quickly Marvell can ship this to hyperscalers."
2. **Semiconductor Talent War:** "Broadcom and Nvidia are both offering $180K+ total comp for comparable firmware roles. Marvell's custom silicon roadmap is more compelling to me, but the comp needs to be competitive."
3. **Equity Upside Framing:** "Marvell's stock has significant upside tied to the AI infrastructure buildout. I'd like a larger RSU grant to align my compensation with the long-term value I'll help create on the optical interconnect platform."
4. **Signing Bonus Bridge:** "I'm leaving unvested equity at my current role. A $20K–$30K signing bonus would bridge the gap and make the transition financially viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm very excited about Marvell's optical interconnect roadmap, especially the Celestial AI integration. I have a competing offer from Broadcom at $195K total comp with a $25K sign-on. My target to join Marvell is $215K total comp — I'd accept $200K as my floor if the RSU grant is front-loaded. I believe the equity upside on Marvell's AI infrastructure bet makes this a strong alignment for both sides. Can we structure the package to hit $215K with a 4-year RSU vest?"
