### DevOps Engineer | Marvell Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Custom Silicon & AI Infrastructure | Celestial AI Acquisition | Standard Band

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $138K–$175K | $90K–$155K | 10–15% | $182K–$248K |
| Boise | $124K–$157K | $76K–$135K | 10–15% | $160K–$220K |
| Remote US | $131K–$166K | $83K–$145K | 10–15% | $170K–$234K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Marvell build and maintain the CI/CD pipelines, build infrastructure, and deployment automation that power silicon design verification, firmware release, and cloud-native platform delivery across Marvell's product portfolio. Semiconductor DevOps is uniquely complex — spanning ASIC design tool chains, hardware emulation farms, firmware build systems, and increasingly, cloud-based deployment for software-defined silicon features. The Celestial AI acquisition has added an entirely new product line that requires dedicated DevOps infrastructure for optical interconnect firmware builds, hardware-in-the-loop testing, and hyperscaler deployment automation.

**Level Mapping:** Marvell DevOps T4–T5 = Google SRE L4–L5 = Meta Production Engineer E4–E5 = Apple SRE ICT3–ICT4 = Broadcom DevOps Engineer = AMD Build & Release Engineer

**Celestial AI Acquisition — The 10x Bandwidth Premium**

Marvell's acquisition of Celestial AI secured photonics-based interconnect technology delivering a 10x bandwidth jump for data center connectivity — the bottleneck technology that determines how fast AI training clusters can communicate. As a DevOps Engineer, you are building the infrastructure that makes it possible to develop, test, and deploy the optical interconnect platform at production quality. This includes CI/CD pipelines for photonics firmware, hardware-in-the-loop test automation that validates optical performance characteristics, and deployment systems that enable hyperscaler customers to roll out optical interconnect upgrades across thousands of nodes. Marvell's bet-the-company investment in AI infrastructure means the DevOps function is not just supporting engineering — it is a critical path dependency for shipping the Celestial AI product. Your negotiation leverage comes from the fact that semiconductor DevOps is already a scarce skill, and adding optical interconnect hardware-in-the-loop testing to the requirements makes the candidate pool vanishingly small. Frame your role as the engineer who determines the velocity of Marvell's most important product line.

**Global Levers**

1. **Semiconductor DevOps Scarcity:** "Semiconductor DevOps requires expertise in ASIC tool chains, hardware emulation, and firmware build systems — skills that are fundamentally different from standard software DevOps. Adding optical interconnect hardware-in-the-loop testing to the requirements makes this an extremely rare skillset."
2. **Velocity Multiplier:** "My DevOps work directly determines the development velocity for the entire Celestial AI optical interconnect team. Faster CI/CD cycles mean faster time-to-market for Marvell's most strategic product."
3. **Competing Offer Baseline:** "I have a DevOps offer from a cloud provider at $235K total comp. Marvell's semiconductor DevOps challenges are more unique, but the comp needs to be competitive with software industry benchmarks."
4. **Infrastructure Investment Commitment:** "I'd like Marvell to commit to a cloud infrastructure budget for the optical interconnect DevOps pipeline — $200K+ annually in compute and tooling — as a signal that this function is properly resourced."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building the DevOps infrastructure for Marvell's optical interconnect platform — semiconductor DevOps at this scale, with hardware-in-the-loop testing for photonics, is a unique engineering challenge. I have a competing offer from [cloud provider] at $235K total comp. My target to join Marvell is $242K total comp, structured as $162K base, $140K RSU/4yr, and 12% bonus. I'd accept $228K as my floor if the role includes dedicated cloud infrastructure budget and the RSU vest is front-loaded to 30% in Year 1. This reflects the scarcity of DevOps engineers with semiconductor and optical interconnect testing experience."
