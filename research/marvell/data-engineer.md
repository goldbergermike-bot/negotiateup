### Data Engineer | Marvell Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Custom Silicon & AI Infrastructure | Celestial AI Acquisition | Standard Band

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $138K–$178K | $92K–$155K | 10–15% | $182K–$252K |
| Boise | $124K–$160K | $78K–$135K | 10–15% | $160K–$224K |
| Remote US | $131K–$169K | $85K–$145K | 10–15% | $170K–$238K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Marvell build the data pipelines, warehouses, and analytical infrastructure that power silicon design decisions, manufacturing yield optimization, customer telemetry analysis, and business intelligence across Marvell's global operations. Semiconductor data engineering is uniquely demanding — dealing with massive volumes of design verification data, wafer-level test results, and real-time performance telemetry from deployed chips across hyperscaler fleets. The Celestial AI acquisition has created new data engineering challenges around optical interconnect performance telemetry, photonics test data pipelines, and real-time monitoring infrastructure for deployed optical interconnect systems.

**Celestial AI Acquisition — The 10x Bandwidth Premium**

Marvell's acquisition of Celestial AI brought photonics-based interconnect technology with a 10x bandwidth jump for data center connectivity — the bottleneck technology that limits AI training cluster communication speed. As a Data Engineer, you are building the data infrastructure that makes the optical interconnect platform observable, measurable, and optimizable. This includes real-time telemetry pipelines for photonics performance data, data warehouses for optical interconnect test and qualification results, and streaming analytics platforms that enable hyperscaler customers to monitor optical interconnect health across thousands of deployed nodes. Marvell's bet-the-company investment in AI infrastructure means the data engineering layer is not optional — it is what transforms a hardware product into a managed, intelligent platform. Your negotiation leverage comes from the fact that Marvell needs data engineers who can build pipelines for an entirely new data domain — photonics performance telemetry — where the schema, volume characteristics, and analytical requirements are still being defined. You are not building on an existing data platform; you are designing the data architecture for a new product category.

**Global Levers**

1. **New Data Domain Complexity:** "I'd be building data pipelines for photonics performance telemetry — a data domain that didn't exist before the Celestial AI acquisition. The schema design, volume modeling, and analytical requirements are greenfield work that directly impacts product quality."
2. **Platform Observability Impact:** "Hyperscaler customers require real-time observability for every component they deploy. My data engineering work on optical interconnect telemetry directly enables customer adoption and retention."
3. **Competing Offer Pressure:** "I have a data engineering offer from a tech company at $240K total comp. Marvell's semiconductor data challenges are more technically differentiated, but the comp needs to match industry benchmarks for senior data engineers."
4. **Scale & Infrastructure Investment:** "I'd like Marvell to commit to a dedicated data platform budget — $150K+ annually in cloud data infrastructure — to ensure the optical interconnect telemetry platform is properly resourced from day one."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building the data infrastructure for Marvell's optical interconnect platform — designing telemetry pipelines for an entirely new data domain is a rare engineering challenge. I have a competing offer at $240K total comp from [tech company] for a senior data engineering role. My target to join Marvell is $248K total comp, structured as $165K base, $142K RSU/4yr, and 12% bonus. I'd accept $232K as my floor if the role includes a dedicated cloud data infrastructure budget and the RSU vest is front-loaded to 30% in Year 1. This reflects the greenfield complexity of building data architecture for photonics telemetry at hyperscaler scale."
