### Technical Program Manager | Marvell Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Custom Silicon & AI Infrastructure | Celestial AI Acquisition | Standard Band

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $138K–$175K | $90K–$155K | 10–15% | $182K–$248K |
| Boise | $124K–$157K | $76K–$135K | 10–15% | $160K–$220K |
| Remote US | $131K–$166K | $83K–$145K | 10–15% | $170K–$234K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Marvell orchestrate the cross-functional execution of silicon product programs — coordinating ASIC design, firmware development, verification, customer qualification, and mass production across globally distributed teams. Semiconductor TPM is among the most complex program management disciplines, with 18–24 month development cycles, hard silicon tape-out deadlines, and zero tolerance for schedule misses. The Celestial AI acquisition has added the complexity of integrating a photonics-based optical interconnect platform into Marvell's existing silicon product delivery process, requiring TPMs who can manage the intersection of traditional semiconductor execution and cutting-edge optical technology development.

**Celestial AI Acquisition — The 10x Bandwidth Premium**

Marvell's acquisition of Celestial AI secured photonics-based interconnect technology that delivers a 10x bandwidth jump for data center connectivity — the bottleneck technology that determines how fast AI training clusters can communicate. As a Technical Program Manager, you are the person who ensures the Celestial AI optical interconnect product actually ships — coordinating silicon design, photonics integration, firmware development, hardware testing, and customer qualification across multiple sites and time zones. This is a bet-the-company investment in AI infrastructure, and the TPM is the single point of accountability for on-time delivery. A missed tape-out deadline or a failed customer qualification doesn't just delay revenue — it gives competitors like Broadcom and Nvidia time to develop alternative optical interconnect solutions. Your negotiation leverage comes from the fact that semiconductor TPMs with optical interconnect program experience simply don't exist yet — this is an emerging discipline. Frame your comp ask around the fact that you are managing the highest-stakes product program at Marvell, with direct visibility to the CEO and board.

**Global Levers**

1. **Critical Path Accountability:** "I'd be the single point of accountability for shipping the Celestial AI optical interconnect product — Marvell's highest-priority program. A TPM slip on this program has board-level visibility and direct competitive consequences."
2. **Semiconductor TPM Complexity:** "Semiconductor TPM is fundamentally more complex than software TPM — hard tape-out deadlines, multi-site coordination, and 18-month development cycles with no room for slip. Adding optical interconnect integration to the scope makes this one of the most complex TPM roles in the industry."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a TPM offer from Google at $240K total comp for a hardware program management role. Marvell's optical interconnect program is more impactful and technically challenging, but the comp needs to be competitive."
4. **Scope-Based Equity Adjustment:** "Given the board-level visibility and CEO-level accountability of the Celestial AI program, I'd like an RSU grant that reflects the strategic importance — $140K over 4 years with annual refreshers tied to program milestones."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about managing the most critical program at Marvell — the Celestial AI optical interconnect product launch. I have a competing offer from Google at $240K total comp for a hardware TPM role. My target to join Marvell is $245K total comp, structured as $165K base, $140K RSU/4yr, and 12% bonus. I'd accept $230K as my floor if the RSU vest is front-loaded to 30% in Year 1 and includes milestone-based refreshers tied to the optical interconnect tape-out and customer qualification deadlines. This reflects the extreme accountability and complexity of managing Marvell's highest-priority product program."
