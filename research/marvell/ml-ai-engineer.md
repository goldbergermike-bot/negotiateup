**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Marvell work at the unique intersection of machine learning and custom silicon — building AI models for chip design optimization, developing ML-based firmware for intelligent data plane processing on Marvell's DPUs, and creating AI-powered performance optimization for data center infrastructure. This is not a typical ML role: you are building AI that runs on custom silicon, and building custom silicon that is optimized for AI. The Celestial AI acquisition adds a new dimension — ML models for optical interconnect performance optimization, predictive maintenance, and adaptive routing across photonics-based networks. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects the extreme scarcity of ML engineers with semiconductor domain expertise.

**Celestial AI Acquisition — The 10x Bandwidth Premium**

Marvell's acquisition of Celestial AI secured photonics-based interconnect technology delivering a 10x bandwidth jump for data center connectivity — the bottleneck technology that determines how fast AI training clusters can communicate. As an ML/AI Engineer, you are building the intelligence layer for this optical interconnect platform. This includes ML models for adaptive optical routing that dynamically optimize bandwidth allocation across AI training clusters, predictive maintenance models that detect photonics degradation before failures occur, and AI-powered performance optimization that helps hyperscaler customers extract maximum throughput from the 10x bandwidth advantage. This is a bet-the-company investment in AI infrastructure, and the ML layer is what transforms raw optical interconnect hardware into an intelligent, self-optimizing platform that justifies premium pricing. Your negotiation leverage is compounded by two scarcity factors: ML engineers are already in high demand (driving the +15-25% AI Premium), and ML engineers with semiconductor or optical interconnect domain knowledge are essentially unicorns. Frame your comp ask around the fact that you bring the rarest skillset combination in the semiconductor industry — and that your ML models will directly determine the competitive differentiation and pricing power of Marvell's most important product.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Premium Justification:** "This role commands a +15-25% AI Premium because ML engineers with semiconductor domain expertise represent fewer than 1% of the ML talent pool. Adding optical interconnect to the domain requirements makes this one of the rarest skillsets in tech."
2. **Revenue Differentiation Impact:** "My ML models for adaptive optical routing and predictive maintenance directly differentiate Marvell's optical interconnect from competitors. This intelligence layer justifies premium pricing and creates switching costs for hyperscaler customers."
3. **Competing Offer Escalation:** "I have an ML engineer offer from Nvidia at $310K total comp. Marvell's optical interconnect ML challenges are more novel and impactful, but the comp needs to reflect the AI Premium — ML engineers with hardware domain expertise command top-of-market rates."
4. **Compute & Research Budget:** "ML development for optical interconnect requires significant GPU compute for training and a research publication budget. I'd like Marvell to commit to $100K+ annually in ML infrastructure and support for conference publication at NeurIPS/ICML."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply excited about building the ML intelligence layer for Marvell's optical interconnect platform — adaptive routing, predictive maintenance, and performance optimization for the technology that enables next-generation AI training. I have a competing offer from Nvidia at $310K total comp for an ML engineering role. My target to join Marvell is $315K total comp, structured as $200K base, $225K RSU/4yr, and 18% bonus. I'd accept $295K as my floor if Marvell provides a $100K annual ML compute budget and the RSU vest is front-loaded to 35% in Year 1. This reflects the +15-25% AI Premium for ML engineers with semiconductor domain expertise and the revenue-defining nature of the intelligence layer I'll build for the optical interconnect platform."
