### Software Engineer | Nuro Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy (Private) | Autonomous Delivery Vehicles | $8.6B Valuation | Mountain View CA | **AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options or RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View / Bay Area | $160K–$225K | $100K–$300K | 10% | $220K–$380K |
| Remote US | $148K–$210K | $85K–$270K | 10% | $200K–$350K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Nuro Software Engineers build the technology platform supporting autonomous delivery vehicle operations — fleet management, delivery orchestration, simulation infrastructure, mapping systems, and operations dashboards. At the IC2-IC3 level, you build and maintain the systems that enable Nuro's autonomous vehicles to operate safely and efficiently in real-world delivery scenarios. Nuro's $8.6B valuation reflects the massive opportunity in autonomous last-mile delivery, and SWEs are essential to building the operational infrastructure. [Source: Nuro SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Nuro SWE (IC2-IC3) = Waymo SWE = Aurora SWE = Zoox SWE = Google L3-L4

**Autonomous Operations — The AV Infrastructure Premium**

As a Software Engineer at Nuro, you build the operational infrastructure that enables autonomous delivery at scale — fleet management, route planning, delivery scheduling, and real-time monitoring. "As a Software Engineer, I build the operational infrastructure enabling Nuro's autonomous delivery at scale — fleet management, delivery orchestration, and monitoring systems. I want IC2-IC3 equity reflecting Nuro's $8.6B valuation and the autonomous delivery market opportunity."

**Global Levers**

1. **Autonomous Operations Infrastructure:** "I build the software infrastructure that enables autonomous delivery operations — fleet management, route optimization, and real-time monitoring for vehicles operating without human drivers."
2. **$8.6B Valuation — Pre-IPO Equity:** "Nuro's $8.6B valuation and autonomous vehicle regulatory milestones create meaningful equity upside for engineers joining at this stage."
3. **Safety-Critical Systems:** "My code supports safety-critical autonomous vehicle operations. The reliability and quality requirements exceed standard software engineering, commanding a premium."
4. **AV Talent Competition:** "Waymo, Aurora, and Zoox compete aggressively for software engineers with AV operations experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and $280K equity over 4 years with 10% bonus for this Software Engineer role. I build the operational infrastructure enabling Nuro's autonomous delivery fleet — fleet management, delivery orchestration, and monitoring systems. I have competing offers from [Waymo at $365K TC / Aurora at $350K TC / Zoox at $340K TC]. Software engineers supporting autonomous vehicle operations command premium compensation." Accept at $185K+ base and $220K+ equity.
