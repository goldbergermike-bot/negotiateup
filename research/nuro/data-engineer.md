**Negotiation DNA**

Nuro Data Engineers build the data infrastructure processing massive sensor data from autonomous delivery vehicles — lidar point clouds, camera feeds, radar signals, GPS telemetry, and delivery event logs. At the IC2-IC3 level, you own data pipelines, storage systems, and processing infrastructure that enable ML model training, safety validation, and operational analytics for the autonomous delivery fleet.

**Level Mapping:** Nuro DE (IC2-IC3) = Waymo DE = Aurora DE = Zoox DE = Google L3-L4 DE

**AV Data Infrastructure — The Sensor Data Premium**

As a Data Engineer at Nuro, you build data infrastructure processing petabytes of sensor data from autonomous vehicles. "As a Data Engineer, I build the data infrastructure processing sensor data from Nuro's autonomous delivery fleet — lidar, camera, radar, and telemetry data at petabyte scale. I want IC2-IC3 equity reflecting the foundational importance of AV data infrastructure."

**Global Levers**

1. **AV Sensor Data Scale:** "I build data pipelines processing petabytes of lidar, camera, radar, and telemetry data from autonomous vehicles. This AV data engineering requires specialized expertise in high-volume sensor data processing."
2. **$8.6B Valuation — Data Foundation:** "Nuro's autonomous driving capability depends entirely on data quality. My data infrastructure enables ML model training, safety validation, and operational analytics."
3. **Sensor Data Domain Expertise:** "Data engineers who understand AV sensor data — lidar point cloud processing, camera feed pipelines, radar signal storage — are extremely rare outside the AV industry."
4. **AV Data Engineer Competition:** "Waymo, Aurora, and Zoox compete for data engineers with AV sensor data experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $222K base and $288K equity over 4 years with 10% bonus for this Data Engineer role. I build the data infrastructure processing petabytes of sensor data from Nuro's autonomous delivery fleet — enabling ML training and safety validation. I have competing offers from [Waymo at $372K TC / Aurora at $355K TC / Zoox at $345K TC]. AV data engineers with sensor data pipeline expertise are scarce." Accept at $188K+ base and $225K+ equity.
