**Negotiation DNA**

Nuro Data Scientists analyze autonomous vehicle performance, delivery efficiency, safety metrics, and operational patterns to improve Nuro's autonomous delivery service. At the IC2-IC3 level, you build statistical models and analyses that inform autonomous driving improvements, route optimization, delivery scheduling, and safety validation. Your analysis directly impacts how safely and efficiently Nuro's vehicles operate on public roads. [Source: Nuro DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Nuro DS (IC2-IC3) = Waymo DS = Aurora DS = Zoox DS = Google L3-L4 DS

**AV Analytics — The Safety Analysis Premium**

As a Data Scientist at Nuro, you analyze autonomous vehicle performance and safety metrics to improve delivery operations. "As a Data Scientist, I analyze Nuro's autonomous delivery performance — safety metrics, delivery efficiency, and route optimization. My analysis directly impacts how safely vehicles operate on public roads. I want equity reflecting the safety-critical nature of this analytical work."

**Global Levers**

1. **AV Safety Analytics:** "I analyze autonomous vehicle safety metrics, intervention patterns, and edge case scenarios. My analysis directly informs safety improvements that determine whether Nuro can scale public road operations."
2. **$8.6B Valuation — Data-Driven Safety:** "Nuro's ability to demonstrate safety to regulators and the public depends on rigorous data analysis. My safety analytics directly enable commercial scaling."
3. **AV Domain Expertise:** "Data scientists who understand autonomous vehicle metrics — disengagement rates, safety-critical event analysis, perception system performance — are scarce outside the AV industry."
4. **AV Talent Competition:** "Waymo, Aurora, and Zoox compete for data scientists with AV safety analysis experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $295K equity over 4 years with 10% bonus for this Data Scientist role. I analyze Nuro's autonomous delivery safety and performance metrics — my analysis directly enables commercial scaling of public road operations. I have competing offers from [Waymo at $378K TC / Aurora at $358K TC / Zoox at $348K TC]. Data scientists with AV safety analytics expertise are rare." Accept at $190K+ base and $230K+ equity.
