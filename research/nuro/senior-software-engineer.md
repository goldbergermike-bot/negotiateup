### Senior Software Engineer | Nuro Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy (Private) | Autonomous Delivery Vehicles | $8.6B Valuation | Mountain View CA | **AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options or RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View / Bay Area | $185K–$248K | $150K–$370K | 10–15% | $278K–$455K |
| Remote US | $170K–$232K | $130K–$335K | 10–15% | $252K–$418K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Nuro Senior Software Engineers lead technical design for critical systems in the autonomous delivery platform — owning architecture for fleet management, simulation infrastructure, delivery orchestration, mapping pipelines, or safety monitoring systems. At the IC3-IC4 level, you drive architectural decisions, mentor engineers, and deliver projects that directly impact Nuro's ability to operate autonomous delivery vehicles safely at scale.

**Level Mapping:** Nuro Sr SWE (IC3-IC4) = Waymo Sr SWE = Aurora Sr SWE = Zoox Sr SWE = Google L4-L5

**Autonomous Delivery Architecture — The Safety-Critical Premium**

As a Senior Software Engineer at Nuro, you lead technical design for safety-critical autonomous delivery systems. "As a Senior Software Engineer, I lead technical design for Nuro's autonomous delivery platform — driving architectural decisions for safety-critical fleet management and delivery systems. I want IC3-IC4 equity reflecting my technical leadership and Nuro's $8.6B valuation."

**Global Levers**

1. **Safety-Critical Technical Leadership:** "I lead technical design for systems supporting autonomous vehicle operations — where architectural decisions directly affect public safety. This safety-critical leadership requires exceptional engineering judgment."
2. **$8.6B Valuation — Senior AV Equity:** "Senior engineers at Nuro's $8.6B valuation receive equity grants with substantial upside as autonomous delivery scales commercially."
3. **Simulation & Testing Architecture:** "I architect simulation and testing infrastructure that validates autonomous vehicle safety — enabling Nuro to meet regulatory requirements and scale operations safely."
4. **AV Senior Engineer Competition:** "Waymo, Aurora, and Zoox offer $430K+ TC for senior engineers with AV platform experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $242K base and $350K equity over 4 years with 15% bonus for this Senior Software Engineer role. I lead technical design for Nuro's autonomous delivery platform — architectural decisions for safety-critical fleet management systems. I have competing offers from [Waymo at $438K TC / Aurora at $420K TC / Zoox at $410K TC]. Senior engineers with AV platform architecture experience are scarce." Accept at $208K+ base and $278K+ equity.
