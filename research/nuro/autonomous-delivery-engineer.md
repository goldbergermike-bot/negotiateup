**Negotiation DNA**

Nuro Autonomous Delivery Engineers are the SIGNATURE ROLE at Nuro — building the autonomous driving stack for purpose-built delivery vehicles that transport groceries, prescriptions, and goods without human drivers. At Nuro's $8.6B valuation, you work on perception, planning, prediction, and control systems for vehicles designed exclusively for last-mile delivery. Nuro is the only company building autonomous vehicles purpose-built for goods delivery (not passenger transport), giving engineers a unique technical challenge: optimizing for cargo safety and delivery efficiency rather than passenger comfort. Nuro has received the first fully autonomous vehicle exemption from NHTSA, enabling on-road operations without traditional vehicle controls. [Source: Nuro Autonomous Delivery Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Autonomous Delivery — The Purpose-Built Premium**

As the Autonomous Delivery Engineer, you build the autonomous driving stack for vehicles that are fundamentally different from passenger AVs — smaller, lighter, designed exclusively for goods transport. This creates unique engineering challenges in perception, planning, and control. "As an Autonomous Delivery Engineer, I build the AV stack for purpose-built delivery vehicles — the only autonomous vehicles with NHTSA regulatory exemption. I want equity reflecting Nuro's $8.6B valuation and the unique technical challenge of goods-only autonomous delivery."

**Global Levers**

1. **Purpose-Built AV Stack:** "I build autonomous driving systems for vehicles purpose-built for goods delivery — unique perception, planning, and control challenges that don't exist in passenger AV companies. This specialization commands premium compensation."
2. **$8.6B Valuation — First NHTSA Exemption:** "Nuro is the first company to receive a fully autonomous vehicle exemption from NHTSA. This regulatory milestone validates the commercial path and increases equity value for engineers building the core AV stack."
3. **Last-Mile Delivery Revolution:** "Autonomous last-mile delivery is a massive market opportunity. My engineering work directly enables Nuro to capture share in the $100B+ last-mile delivery market."
4. **Waymo/Cruise/Aurora Competition:** "Autonomous vehicle engineers are among the most competed-for talent in tech. Waymo, Aurora, and Zoox offer $450K+ TC packages for AV engineers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $240K base and $360K equity over 4 years with 15% bonus for this Autonomous Delivery Engineer role. I build the autonomous driving stack for Nuro's purpose-built delivery vehicles — the only AVs with NHTSA regulatory exemption. I have competing offers from [Waymo at $445K TC / Aurora at $428K TC / Zoox at $418K TC]. Autonomous delivery engineers building purpose-built AV systems are exceptionally rare." Accept at $205K+ base and $285K+ equity.
