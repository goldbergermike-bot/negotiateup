### ML/AI Engineer | Nuro Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy (Private) | Autonomous Delivery Vehicles | $8.6B Valuation | Mountain View CA | **AUTONOMOUS PERCEPTION/PLANNING PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options or RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View / Bay Area | $178K–$248K | $140K–$365K | 10–15% | $268K–$455K |
| Remote US | $165K–$232K | $120K–$330K | 10–15% | $245K–$418K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Nuro ML/AI Engineers build the core autonomous driving models — perception systems that detect pedestrians, vehicles, and obstacles; prediction models that forecast road user behavior; and planning algorithms that generate safe driving trajectories. At the IC2-IC4 level, you develop and deploy the ML models that enable Nuro's vehicles to navigate public roads autonomously. This is among the most technically challenging ML work in the industry, requiring real-time inference with safety-critical accuracy requirements. [Source: Nuro ML/AI Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Nuro ML/AI (IC2-IC4) = Waymo ML/AI = Aurora ML/AI = Zoox ML/AI = Google L3-L5 ML AV

**Autonomous ML — The Safety-Critical AI Premium**

As an ML/AI Engineer at Nuro, you build the core models enabling autonomous driving — where model accuracy has direct safety implications. "As an ML/AI Engineer, I build the perception, prediction, and planning models enabling Nuro's autonomous delivery — where model accuracy directly affects public safety. I want equity reflecting the exceptional technical challenge and safety criticality of AV ML."

**Global Levers**

1. **Safety-Critical ML:** "I build ML models where accuracy has direct safety implications — perception systems detecting pedestrians, prediction models forecasting road user behavior. This safety-critical ML requires exceptional rigor and commands premium compensation."
2. **$8.6B Valuation — Core AV Capability:** "ML/AI engineers build Nuro's core autonomous driving capability. Without perception, prediction, and planning models, there is no autonomous delivery. My work IS the product."
3. **Real-Time Inference Expertise:** "I build models that must run in real-time on vehicle hardware with safety-critical latency requirements — a unique ML engineering challenge that combines model performance with embedded systems constraints."
4. **AV ML Competition:** "AV ML engineers are among the most competed-for talent in tech. Waymo, Aurora, Zoox, Apple, and Tesla offer $440K+ TC for ML engineers with autonomous driving experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $242K base and $348K equity over 4 years with 15% bonus for this ML/AI Engineer role. I build the perception, prediction, and planning models enabling Nuro's autonomous delivery — safety-critical ML with real-time inference requirements. I have competing offers from [Waymo at $442K TC / Aurora at $425K TC / Zoox at $415K TC]. ML engineers building safety-critical autonomous driving models are the most competed-for AI talent." Accept at $205K+ base and $275K+ equity.
