**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at AT&T own the strategy and roadmap for products serving 100M+ wireless connections and millions of AT&T Fiber customers at a $155B company. Whether you're driving the myAT&T consumer app strategy, defining 5G-enabled services, building AT&T Fiber broadband experiences, or developing enterprise networking solutions, you manage products at a scale that few companies can match. AT&T's product management function is evolving as the company transforms from a legacy telecom operator to a modern connectivity platform.

AT&T PMs have a unique opportunity: the company is actively reimagining its product portfolio around 5G, fiber, and enterprise services. PMs who can drive this product transformation — introducing modern product practices and building compelling new services — have outsized influence on AT&T's competitive future.

**Level Mapping:** AT&T PM (P3-P5) = Google L4-L6 PM = Meta E4-E6 PM = Amazon PM L5-L7 = Verizon PM

**AT&T Product Transformation Premium**

AT&T PMs who bring modern product management practices — data-driven decision making, rapid experimentation, customer-centric design — accelerate the company's product transformation. The opportunity to reshape how 100M+ customers experience AT&T's services creates career-defining product work with massive consumer impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **Product Transformation Leadership:** "AT&T's product portfolio is being reimagined around 5G and fiber. PMs who can drive this transformation create outsized strategic value. My product leadership at [company] directly enables this evolution. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **100M+ Customer Revenue Ownership:** "My product decisions impact subscriber growth, ARPU, and retention for 100M+ wireless connections and millions of fiber customers. This P&L ownership warrants RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Competing PM Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/T-Mobile] at $[X]K. AT&T's product transformation opportunity is compelling, but the package needs to be competitive."

4. **5G + Fiber Product Innovation:** "AT&T's dual 5G and fiber investment creates unique product opportunities. PMs who can build compelling services leveraging both technologies drive differentiated revenue growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Owning product strategy at AT&T — transforming the product experience for 100M+ customers while building new 5G and fiber services — is a compelling PM opportunity. To align with market rates: a base of $[165-178]K, RSU grant of $[92-108]K, and a signing bonus of $[18-28]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[215-248]K, this reflects the product transformation scope and competitive PM market. I'm ready to accept."
