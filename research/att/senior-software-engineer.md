| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at AT&T own the architecture and implementation of systems serving the largest telecommunications network in America. At the Senior level, you drive technical decisions for consumer platforms, network management systems, enterprise solutions, or 5G-enabled services. Senior SWEs are the primary agents of AT&T's technology modernization — bringing cloud-native architecture, modern engineering practices, and API-first design to a company transforming from legacy telecom to modern technology infrastructure.

AT&T's Senior SWE compensation has improved as the company recognizes that modernization depends on attracting senior engineering talent from modern tech backgrounds. Total comp of $170K-$278K reflects this investment, with RSU grants and signing bonuses providing meaningful upside.

**Level Mapping:** AT&T Senior SWE (L5) = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Amazon SDE III = Verizon L5 = T-Mobile L6

**AT&T Senior Modernization Premium**

Senior SWEs at AT&T have outsized influence because they are the change agents driving technology modernization. A Senior SWE at AT&T doesn't just build features — they introduce modern architecture patterns, establish cloud-native best practices, and demonstrate that AT&T's engineering organization can operate at the quality and velocity expected of a modern technology company. This modernization leadership is AT&T's most critical technical need.

**Global Levers**

1. **Modernization Change Agent:** "At the Senior level, I'll drive AT&T's technology modernization — introducing cloud-native architecture, modern CI/CD, and API-first design. My track record of leading similar transformations at [company] directly enables AT&T's most critical technology priority. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Legacy Network Scale Ownership:** "I'll own architecture decisions affecting 100M+ wireless connections and 25M+ fiber passings. This scale of technical ownership is exceptional. RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Competing Senior Offers:** "I have competing offers from [Google/Amazon/T-Mobile] at the L5/SDE III level with total comp of $[X]K. While AT&T's modernization opportunity and network scale are compelling, the gap needs to narrow."

4. **Enterprise + Consumer Architecture:** "I'll architect systems spanning consumer wireless, fiber broadband, and enterprise networking — a breadth of technical domains that exceeds most single-product companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Driving AT&T's technology modernization at the Senior SWE level — introducing modern architecture to the largest telecom network in America — is a high-impact opportunity. To align with market rates: a base of $[182-195]K, RSU grant of $[100-118]K, and a signing bonus of $[22-32]K. My competing offer is $[X]K. At $[235-262]K, this reflects the senior engineering market and AT&T's critical need for modernization talent. I'm ready to commit."
