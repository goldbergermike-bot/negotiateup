### ML/AI Engineer | AT&T Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $155B Legacy Telecom Modernizing | AI-Powered Network + Customer Intelligence | **+10-18% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Dallas / Austin | $132K–$190K | $32K–$120K | 12-15% | $158K–$258K |
| NYC / New Jersey | $140K–$200K | $38K–$130K | 12-15% | $170K–$275K |
| Atlanta / Seattle | $128K–$185K | $30K–$112K | 12-15% | $152K–$248K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at AT&T build the intelligence systems that optimize the largest telecommunications network in America and drive automation across the company's operations. From AI-powered network management (predictive maintenance, capacity planning, anomaly detection) to customer intelligence (churn prediction, personalization, virtual assistants) to enterprise AI solutions (network analytics, security automation) — ML is central to AT&T's modernization strategy. AT&T has declared AI a strategic priority, investing heavily in ML infrastructure, hiring AI talent from Big Tech, and deploying AI across its network and customer operations.

The AI Premium of 10-18% reflects the acute talent scarcity for ML engineers with telecom domain expertise, particularly in network optimization, customer analytics, and operational automation.

**Level Mapping:** AT&T ML/AI Engineer (L4-L6) = Google L4-L6 ML = Meta E4-E6 ML = Amazon Applied Scientist II-III = Verizon L4-L6

**AT&T AI Transformation Premium**

AT&T's AI strategy represents the most ambitious application of ML in legacy telecom transformation. The company's network — spanning 5G, fiber, FirstNet, and enterprise — generates more operational data than almost any organization on Earth. ML Engineers who can transform this data into automated network management, predictive operations, and intelligent customer experiences are building the intelligence layer that determines AT&T's competitive future.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Talent Scarcity Premium:** "ML engineers with telecom domain expertise are exceptionally rare. My competing offers from [Google/Amazon/T-Mobile] at $[X]K include AI premiums. AT&T's offer should reflect this talent scarcity."

2. **Network AI Transformation Impact:** "AI-driven network optimization directly reduces operational costs and improves service quality for 100M+ connections. My models translate to hundreds of millions in efficiency and quality improvements."

3. **Customer AI Revenue Impact:** "Churn prediction and personalization models for 100M+ connections directly impact subscriber retention — each 0.1% improvement saves enormous revenue. Direct P&L attribution."

4. **AI Modernization Catalyst:** "ML engineers at AT&T are catalysts for the company's broader technology modernization — building cloud-native ML platforms, establishing MLOps practices, and demonstrating the ROI of AI investment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Applying AI to AT&T's network optimization and 100M+ customer intelligence is the most impactful telecom ML opportunity. I hold a competing offer from [Google/Amazon] at $[X]K including an AI premium. To make AT&T competitive: $[178-190]K base, $[105-120]K RSUs, and a $[20-30]K signing bonus. At $[225-258]K, this reflects the AI talent premium and AT&T's multi-domain ML impact. I'm ready to build AT&T's AI future."
