**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at AT&T shape the experience for 100M+ wireless customers and millions of AT&T Fiber subscribers across consumer and enterprise touchpoints. The myAT&T app, account management tools, fiber installation experience, and enterprise service portals represent critical touchpoints that directly impact customer satisfaction and competitive positioning. AT&T's consumer experience has historically lagged behind T-Mobile's Un-carrier design innovation, and the company has invested in design transformation to close this gap.

AT&T is actively recruiting design talent from consumer tech companies to modernize its digital experience. Designers who bring modern design practices and consumer-grade UX sensibility to AT&T's products are driving a meaningful transformation in how millions of Americans interact with their telecommunications provider.

**AT&T Design Transformation Premium**

AT&T's design transformation is an opportunity for designers to have outsized impact. Unlike joining a company with an already-mature design culture, AT&T designers are establishing design standards, building design systems, and raising the UX bar for 100M+ customers. Designers who can lead this transformation create legacy-defining work and measurable business impact through improved customer satisfaction and self-service adoption.
