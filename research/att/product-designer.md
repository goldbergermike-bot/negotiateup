### Product Designer | AT&T Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $155B Legacy Telecom Modernizing | Consumer Experience Transformation | myAT&T + Fiber + 5G Design

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Dallas / Austin | $105K–$155K | $20K–$82K | 10-15% | $125K–$200K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at AT&T shape the experience for 100M+ wireless customers and millions of AT&T Fiber subscribers across consumer and enterprise touchpoints. The myAT&T app, account management tools, fiber installation experience, and enterprise service portals represent critical touchpoints that directly impact customer satisfaction and competitive positioning. AT&T's consumer experience has historically lagged behind T-Mobile's Un-carrier design innovation, and the company has invested in design transformation to close this gap.

AT&T is actively recruiting design talent from consumer tech companies to modernize its digital experience. Designers who bring modern design practices and consumer-grade UX sensibility to AT&T's products are driving a meaningful transformation in how millions of Americans interact with their telecommunications provider.

**Level Mapping:** AT&T Product Designer (D2-D4) = Google L3-L5 UX = Meta E3-E5 Designer = Verizon D2-D4 = T-Mobile D3-D5

**AT&T Design Transformation Premium**

AT&T's design transformation is an opportunity for designers to have outsized impact. Unlike joining a company with an already-mature design culture, AT&T designers are establishing design standards, building design systems, and raising the UX bar for 100M+ customers. Designers who can lead this transformation create legacy-defining work and measurable business impact through improved customer satisfaction and self-service adoption.

**Global Levers**

1. **Design Transformation Leadership:** "AT&T's consumer experience needs modernization — and designers who can lead this transformation have outsized impact. My portfolio demonstrates exactly this ability to elevate consumer experience at scale. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **100M+ Customer Impact:** "My designs will reach 100M+ customers. UX improvements in self-service, account management, and service activation directly reduce care costs and improve satisfaction. RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Competing Design Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/T-Mobile/Amazon] at $[X]K. AT&T's design transformation opportunity is compelling, but the compensation needs to attract talent from companies with mature design cultures."

4. **Competitive UX Necessity:** "T-Mobile has used design as a competitive weapon. AT&T must match or exceed this UX quality to justify its pricing. My design expertise directly addresses this competitive imperative."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Transforming AT&T's consumer experience for 100M+ customers is exactly the design challenge I want — the opportunity to define design standards at scale. To align with market rates: a base of $[X+8-10]K, RSU grant of $[Y+12-18]K, and a signing bonus of $[10-15]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[170-200]K, this reflects the design transformation value and competitive UX imperative. I'm ready to join."
