### Software Engineer | AT&T Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $155B Legacy Telecom Modernizing | 5G + Fiber + Enterprise | Legacy Telecom Modernizing Tech Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Dallas / Austin | $115K–$170K | $25K–$100K | 10-15% | $140K–$230K |
| NYC / New Jersey | $122K–$178K | $28K–$108K | 10-15% | $148K–$242K |
| Atlanta / Seattle | $112K–$165K | $22K–$92K | 10-15% | $135K–$218K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at AT&T build technology for one of the world's largest telecommunications companies. With a $155B market cap and Dallas headquarters, AT&T operates across 5G wireless (100M+ connections), fiber broadband (25M+ fiber passings), FirstNet (nationwide public safety network), and massive enterprise networking services. AT&T is undergoing a significant technology modernization — shedding legacy media assets (WarnerMedia) to refocus on connectivity and investing heavily in cloud-native architectures, 5G services, and fiber expansion.

AT&T's compensation philosophy is evolving as the company modernizes its engineering culture. While AT&T's total comp has historically been below Big Tech levels, the company has increased RSU grants, added signing bonuses, and raised base salary bands to compete for engineering talent. Base salaries of $115K-$170K, RSUs up to $100K over four years, and 10-15% bonuses bring total comp to $140K-$230K — competitive with other legacy telecom companies and approaching mid-tier tech levels for strong candidates.

**Level Mapping:** AT&T SWE (L3-L4) = Google L3-L4 = Meta E3-E4 = Amazon SDE I-II = Verizon L3-L4 = T-Mobile L4-L5

**AT&T Technology Modernization Premium**

AT&T's technology modernization is a massive multi-year initiative — migrating from legacy telecom systems to cloud-native platforms, building 5G service infrastructure, and creating modern engineering practices. SWEs who bring experience from modern tech companies accelerate this transformation and are compensated with premiums above AT&T's traditional engineering bands. The company has also invested in building modern engineering centers and recruiting from the broader tech ecosystem, particularly in Dallas, Austin, and Atlanta.

**Global Levers**

1. **Legacy-to-Modern Transformation Value:** "AT&T's technology modernization — cloud migration, API-first architecture, microservices — requires engineers who bring modern engineering practices. My experience at [company] directly accelerates this transformation. I'd like a base of $[X]K that reflects this transformation value."

2. **Consumer + Enterprise Scale:** "I'll build technology serving 100M+ wireless connections and massive enterprise customers. This dual consumer-enterprise scale creates engineering challenges that exceed most companies. RSUs of $[Y]K over four years."

3. **Competing Tech Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/T-Mobile] at $[X]K total comp. While I'm drawn to AT&T's modernization opportunity and the scale of impact, the package needs to be competitive for me to make the move."

4. **5G and Fiber Platform Engineering:** "AT&T's dual investment in 5G and fiber creates unique engineering opportunities. Building platforms that leverage both 5G wireless and fiber broadband capabilities positions me at the frontier of connectivity technology."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. AT&T's technology modernization and the scale of engineering impact — 100M+ wireless connections, 25M+ fiber passings — are genuinely compelling. To align with market rates: a base increase to $[X+10-12]K, RSU grant of $[Y+18-28]K, and a signing bonus of $[15-25]K. My competing offer from [competitor] is $[TC]K. At $[190-230]K, this reflects the competitive engineering market and the modernization premium AT&T should pay for talent from modern tech backgrounds. I'm ready to sign."
