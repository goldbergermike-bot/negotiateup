### Staff Software Engineer | AT&T Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $155B Legacy Telecom Modernizing | Technical Strategy Owner | Network + Platform Architecture Authority

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Dallas / Austin | $168K–$232K | $58K–$178K | 15-18% | $220K–$350K |
| NYC / New Jersey | $175K–$242K | $65K–$190K | 15-18% | $232K–$370K |
| Atlanta / Seattle | $162K–$225K | $52K–$165K | 15-18% | $208K–$332K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at AT&T set the technical direction for a $155B telecommunications company undergoing its most significant technology transformation in decades. At this level, you define platform architecture, drive modernization strategy, and make foundational technology decisions that affect thousands of engineers and 100M+ wireless connections. Staff SWEs at AT&T are the architects of the company's future — determining whether AT&T can successfully transform from legacy telecom to modern technology infrastructure.

AT&T's Staff-level compensation reflects the company's recognition that top technical leadership is critical to its transformation. Total comp of $220K-$370K positions the role competitively within the telecom-tech tier, with growing RSU grants demonstrating AT&T's commitment to long-term retention of Staff engineers.

**Level Mapping:** AT&T Staff SWE (L6-L7) = Google L6 = Meta E6 = Amazon Principal SDE = Verizon L6-L7 = T-Mobile L7

**AT&T Staff Transformation Premium**

Staff SWEs at AT&T have extraordinary transformative influence. The company's modernization — cloud migration, API-first architecture, DevOps culture, microservices — depends on Staff engineers who can design the target architecture, drive organizational change, and demonstrate that the transformation is technically sound. Staff engineers who have led similar transformations at modern tech companies are the most sought-after hires in AT&T's engineering organization.

**Global Levers**

1. **Transformation Architecture Authority:** "I'll set the technical direction for AT&T's modernization — designing the target architecture for cloud-native, API-first systems at the largest telecom in America. This transformative influence warrants top-of-band compensation at $[X]K base and $[Y]K RSUs."

2. **Staff Market Competition:** "Staff engineers are recruited by Google, Meta, and Amazon at $600K-$800K+ total comp. AT&T's offer should reflect that Staff-level talent choosing AT&T's transformation mission is forgoing significantly higher compensation elsewhere."

3. **Organization-Wide Technical Leadership:** "My architectural decisions will affect thousands of engineers and shape AT&T's technology strategy. This organization-wide influence drives the company's competitive future."

4. **Critical Infrastructure Modernization:** "Modernizing the technology infrastructure for America's largest telecom network is among the most consequential technology transformations in the industry. Staff engineers leading this transformation create enormous strategic value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Setting AT&T's technical direction — architecting the modernization of America's largest telecom network — is a once-in-a-career transformation opportunity. I hold a competing offer from [Google/Amazon] at the L6/Principal level at $[X]K total comp. To make AT&T work: $[222-232]K base, $[160-178]K RSUs, and a $[38-52]K signing bonus. At $[310-350]K, this reflects Staff-level impact and the strategic value of transformation leadership at a $155B company. I'm ready to lead AT&T's technical future."
