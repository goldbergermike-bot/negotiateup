**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at AT&T protect the largest telecommunications network in America — critical national infrastructure serving 100M+ wireless connections, 25M+ fiber passings, FirstNet (the nationwide public safety broadband network), and enterprise customers including government and defense agencies. AT&T's security scope is among the most demanding in any industry: wireless and fiber network security, 5G core infrastructure, consumer data protection (PII, payment data, CPNI), FirstNet security (public safety and national security implications), and government/defense-grade security requirements.

AT&T's cybersecurity organization is one of the largest in the world, and the company's security investments reflect the critical nature of its infrastructure. Security Engineers at AT&T protect systems that first responders, government agencies, and businesses depend on — making this one of the most mission-critical security roles in the industry.

**Level Mapping:** AT&T Security Engineer (L3-L5) = Google L3-L5 Security = Meta E3-E5 Security = Amazon Security Engineer II-III = Verizon L3-L5

**AT&T Critical Infrastructure + FirstNet Security Premium**

AT&T's security requirements are uniquely demanding because of FirstNet — the nationwide public safety broadband network that first responders depend on. Security compromises affecting FirstNet could impact emergency response capabilities across the country. This public safety dimension adds a layer of criticality and regulatory scrutiny that elevates the importance (and compensation) of Security Engineers at AT&T.

**Global Levers**

1. **Critical + Public Safety Infrastructure:** "I'll protect telecommunications infrastructure serving 100M+ Americans AND FirstNet — the public safety network first responders depend on. This dual critical infrastructure responsibility exceeds almost any security role in the industry. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Cybersecurity talent with telecom infrastructure and government-grade security expertise is exceptionally rare. My competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto/government] is $[X]K."

3. **Government/Defense Security Clearance:** "My [security clearance level] and experience with government-grade security requirements are directly relevant to AT&T's FirstNet and government customer obligations. This clearance and expertise command a premium."

4. **Network Modernization Security:** "AT&T's technology modernization must maintain security during transformation — migrating from legacy to cloud without introducing vulnerabilities. My experience securing similar transformations is directly valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Protecting AT&T's critical infrastructure and FirstNet public safety network is a security mission that genuinely matters. To align with market rates: a base of $[165-178]K, RSU grant of $[90-108]K, and a signing bonus of $[18-28]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[210-242]K, this reflects security talent scarcity and critical infrastructure protection responsibility. I'm ready to defend AT&T's network."
