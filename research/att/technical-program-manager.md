**Negotiation DNA:** $155B Legacy Telecom Modernizing | Cross-Organization Program Delivery | Network Modernization + Enterprise Programs

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Dallas / Austin | $125K–$178K | $28K–$108K | 12-18% | $150K–$248K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at AT&T orchestrate delivery of complex technology programs across the largest telecommunications company in America. AT&T's programs are uniquely complex: 5G network deployment across thousands of cell sites, fiber expansion to millions of new passings, consumer platform modernization for 100M+ customers, enterprise solution rollouts for major corporations and government agencies, and the ongoing technology transformation from legacy to cloud-native systems. A TPM at AT&T coordinates across network engineering, software development, product, operations, and often government stakeholders — navigating one of the most complex organizational structures in the industry.

AT&T's technology transformation has elevated the TPM function — programs that modernize core systems, migrate to the cloud, and deploy next-generation network infrastructure require sophisticated program management that bridges physical infrastructure and digital platforms.

**Level Mapping:** AT&T TPM (L4-L6) = Google L4-L6 TPM = Meta E4-E6 TPM = Amazon TPM L5-L7 = Verizon TPM

**AT&T Transformation Program Premium**

AT&T TPMs operate in an environment of exceptional organizational and technical complexity. The company's massive scale (100M+ connections), ongoing modernization, physical + digital infrastructure, and regulatory requirements (FCC, government contracts, FirstNet) create program management challenges that exceed most technology companies. TPMs who can navigate this complexity while driving AT&T's transformation forward are extremely valuable.

**Global Levers**

1. **Transformation Program Complexity:** "AT&T's technology transformation programs are among the most complex in the industry — modernizing legacy systems, deploying 5G, expanding fiber, and evolving enterprise services simultaneously. My experience managing similar transformations at [company] is directly valuable."

2. **Physical + Digital Program Scope:** "AT&T's programs span network infrastructure (cell towers, fiber) and software platforms (consumer apps, enterprise services) — a dual complexity that requires rare program management expertise."

3. **Competing TPM Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/T-Mobile] at $[X]K. AT&T's transformation complexity is compelling, but the compensation needs to be competitive."

4. **Government + Regulatory Navigation:** "AT&T's FirstNet and government programs require TPMs who can navigate regulatory requirements and government stakeholders — skills that add meaningful value and complexity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Driving AT&T's transformation programs — modernizing the largest telecom in America across 5G, fiber, and enterprise — is the complex TPM work I excel at. To align with market rates: a base of $[165-178]K, RSU grant of $[90-108]K, and a signing bonus of $[18-28]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[215-248]K, this reflects the transformation complexity and competitive TPM market. I'm ready to deliver."
