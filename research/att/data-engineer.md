**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at AT&T build the data infrastructure powering intelligence across the largest telecommunications network in America. With 100M+ wireless connections, 25M+ fiber passings (AT&T Fiber), FirstNet (public safety network), and massive enterprise networking, AT&T generates enormous data volumes — network telemetry, customer usage and billing, enterprise service analytics, and content delivery metrics. Data Engineers design the pipelines, warehouses, and streaming architectures that transform this data into network optimization intelligence, customer analytics, and business insights.

AT&T's data infrastructure is undergoing significant modernization — migrating from legacy data systems to cloud-native platforms. Data Engineers with experience in modern data architectures are critical to this transformation.

**Level Mapping:** AT&T Data Engineer (L3-L5) = Google L3-L5 DE = Meta E3-E5 DE = Amazon DE II-III = Verizon L3-L5

**AT&T Data Modernization Premium**

AT&T's data modernization is particularly impactful because the company sits on one of the richest data estates in telecommunications. The combination of wireless, fiber, FirstNet, and enterprise data — when unified on a modern platform — enables cross-domain analytics that inform billions in network investment, customer strategy, and enterprise sales. Data Engineers who build this modernized infrastructure unlock enormous latent value.

**Global Levers**
