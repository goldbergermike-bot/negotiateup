### Data Scientist | AT&T Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $155B Legacy Telecom Modernizing | Network Intelligence + Customer Analytics | Telecom AI Transformation

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Dallas / Austin | $118K–$172K | $26K–$102K | 10-15% | $142K–$235K |
| NYC / New Jersey | $125K–$180K | $30K–$110K | 10-15% | $152K–$248K |
| Atlanta / Seattle | $115K–$168K | $24K–$95K | 10-15% | $138K–$222K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at AT&T build models that optimize the largest telecommunications network in America and drive intelligence for 100M+ wireless connections and 25M+ fiber customers. From network capacity planning and congestion prediction to customer churn models, pricing optimization, and enterprise sales analytics — data science at AT&T directly impacts billions in network investment decisions and customer lifetime value. AT&T's data scientists work with uniquely massive datasets spanning wireless, fiber, FirstNet, and enterprise networking.

AT&T has invested in data science capabilities, recognizing that AI/ML-driven optimization is critical to competing against T-Mobile's network advantage and modernizing network operations.

**Level Mapping:** AT&T Data Scientist (L3-L5) = Google L3-L5 DS = Meta E3-E5 DS = Amazon DS II-III = Verizon L3-L5

**AT&T Network Intelligence Premium**

AT&T's data science is uniquely impactful because models directly influence network investment decisions worth billions. A capacity planning model that optimizes 5G deployment saves hundreds of millions in capital expenditure. A churn prediction model that improves retention by 0.1% across 100M+ connections saves enormous revenue. Data Scientists at AT&T are not building abstract analytics — they are building the intelligence that drives one of the largest infrastructure investment programs in the world.

**Global Levers**

1. **Network Investment Intelligence:** "My models will inform network investment decisions worth billions — where to deploy 5G, how to plan fiber expansion, and how to optimize capital allocation. Even marginal improvements in investment ROI translate to hundreds of millions. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Customer Scale Analytics:** "Churn prediction, pricing optimization, and marketing attribution for 100M+ wireless connections and 25M+ fiber customers. My models directly impact subscriber retention. RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Competing DS Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/T-Mobile] at $[X]K. AT&T's network intelligence opportunity is compelling, but the compensation needs to be competitive."

4. **AI Transformation Impact:** "AT&T's AI transformation depends on data scientists who can build production models that drive real business impact. My track record of deploying revenue-impacting ML at [company] directly supports this transformation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Applying data science to AT&T's network optimization and 100M+ customer intelligence is high-impact analytical work. To align with market rates: a base of $[158-172]K, RSU grant of $[85-102]K, and a signing bonus of $[15-22]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[200-235]K, this reflects the revenue impact and network intelligence scope. I'm ready to accept."
