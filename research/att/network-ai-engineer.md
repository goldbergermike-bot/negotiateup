### Network AI Engineer | AT&T Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $155B Legacy Telecom Modernizing | AI-Powered Network Intelligence | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+12-18% AI/NETWORK PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Dallas / Austin | $145K–$200K | $40K–$128K | 12-15% | $178K–$272K |
| NYC / New Jersey | $152K–$210K | $45K–$138K | 12-15% | $188K–$290K |
| Atlanta / Seattle | $142K–$195K | $38K–$122K | 12-15% | $172K–$262K |

**Negotiation DNA**

The Network AI Engineer is AT&T's signature technical role — building the AI/ML systems that optimize, automate, and transform the largest telecommunications network in America. AT&T's $155B market cap and Dallas headquarters position it as a legacy telecom giant undergoing a massive technology modernization, and Network AI is at the center of that transformation. You are building machine learning models that predict network congestion, automate capacity planning, optimize spectrum allocation, detect anomalies, and enable self-healing network capabilities across AT&T's nationwide 5G, fiber, and enterprise infrastructure.

This role commands a 12-18% AI/network premium because it requires rare dual expertise in both telecommunications network architecture and production machine learning. Engineers who understand 5G RAN optimization AND can build production ML pipelines are among the scarcest talent in the industry, with every major carrier, network equipment vendor, and cloud provider competing for the same pool.

**Level Mapping:** AT&T Network AI Engineer (Senior) = Google L5 ML Engineer = Ericsson Senior AI Engineer = T-Mobile Senior ML Engineer = Verizon Senior ML/Network Engineer

**AT&T Network AI Premium — Transforming Legacy Telecom with AI**

AT&T's Network AI strategy represents the most ambitious AI transformation in telecommunications. The company's network — spanning 5G wireless, fiber broadband (25M+ fiber passings), FirstNet (public safety network), and massive enterprise networking — generates more network telemetry data than almost any company on Earth. Network AI Engineers are building the intelligence layer that transforms this data into automated network management, predictive maintenance, and self-optimizing infrastructure. This is not incremental improvement — it's a fundamental shift from reactive to proactive, AI-driven network operations that will define AT&T's competitive position for the next decade.

**Global Levers**

1. **Signature Role — AI-Driven Network Transformation:** "I'm building the AI systems that transform AT&T's network operations from reactive to predictive — automating management of the largest telecom network in America. This isn't an incremental ML project; it's the technological foundation of AT&T's modernization strategy. This signature role warrants premium AI/network compensation."

2. **AI + Telecom Dual Expertise Scarcity:** "Engineers with both production ML expertise and telecommunications network domain knowledge are among the rarest in the market. Google, Amazon, Ericsson, and every major carrier compete for this talent. I'd like RSUs of $[X]K reflecting this scarcity premium."

3. **Network Scale Impact:** "My AI models will optimize a network serving 100M+ wireless connections and 25M+ fiber passings. Even marginal improvements in network efficiency — 1% better capacity utilization, 5% fewer outages — translate to hundreds of millions in value for a $155B company."

4. **FirstNet AI — Public Safety Impact:** "AT&T operates FirstNet, the nationwide public safety broadband network. AI-optimized network management for FirstNet isn't just a business priority — it directly impacts emergency response capabilities. This public mission adds meaningful dimension to the role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Building AT&T's Network AI — transforming the largest telecom network in America with machine learning — is the most impactful AI opportunity in telecommunications. I hold a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/T-Mobile] at $[X]K total comp including an AI premium. To make AT&T competitive: $[190K] base, $[115K] RSUs over four years, and a $[25K] signing bonus. At $[248-272]K, this reflects the AI/network dual expertise premium and the signature nature of this role. I'm ready to transform AT&T's network with AI."
