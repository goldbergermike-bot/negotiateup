**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at AT&T ensure the reliability and performance of infrastructure supporting the largest telecommunications network in America. AT&T's infrastructure is among the most complex in the industry — spanning wireless network operations (100M+ connections), fiber broadband infrastructure (25M+ passings), FirstNet (public safety), consumer platforms, and enterprise networking services. The company's DevOps transformation is a critical component of its broader technology modernization — moving from legacy operational practices to cloud-native infrastructure, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and infrastructure-as-code.

AT&T's DevOps culture is evolving rapidly. The company has invested in cloud partnerships (primarily Microsoft Azure), containerization, and modern deployment practices. DevOps Engineers who can drive this transformation while maintaining the reliability of critical telecommunications infrastructure are highly valued.

**Level Mapping:** AT&T DevOps Engineer (L3-L5) = Google L3-L5 SRE = Amazon SDE II-III (Infrastructure) = Verizon L3-L5 = T-Mobile L4-L6

**AT&T Infrastructure Transformation Premium**

AT&T's DevOps transformation is one of the largest infrastructure modernization efforts in the industry. The company is migrating tens of thousands of workloads to the cloud, containerizing applications, and establishing modern DevOps practices across a massive engineering organization. DevOps Engineers who can lead this transformation — demonstrating that cloud-native practices work at telecom scale — create enormous strategic value.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cloud Transformation Leadership:** "AT&T's cloud migration is one of the largest in the industry. My experience with [Azure/Kubernetes/IaC] can accelerate this transformation while maintaining carrier-grade reliability. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Critical Infrastructure Reliability:** "AT&T operates critical national infrastructure — including FirstNet for public safety. Maintaining reliability during modernization requires exceptional DevOps expertise. RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Competing Infrastructure Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Azure/AWS/T-Mobile] at $[X]K. AT&T's transformation challenge is compelling, but the compensation needs to be competitive."

4. **Scale of Modernization Impact:** "Modernizing infrastructure practices for 70,000+ AT&T employees and millions of customers is among the most consequential DevOps transformations in the industry."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "AT&T's infrastructure transformation — modernizing the largest telecom in America while maintaining critical reliability — is exactly the DevOps challenge I solve. To align with market rates: a base of $[X+8-10]K, RSU grant of $[Y+15-22]K, and a signing bonus of $[12-20]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[185-222]K, this reflects cloud transformation value and critical infrastructure DevOps expertise. I'm ready to commit."
