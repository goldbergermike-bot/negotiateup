DevOps Engineers at AT&T ensure the reliability and performance of infrastructure supporting the largest telecommunications network in America. AT&T's infrastructure is among the most complex in the industry — spanning wireless network operations (100M+ connections), fiber broadband infrastructure (25M+ passings), FirstNet (public safety), consumer platforms, and enterprise networking services. The company's DevOps transformation is a critical component of its broader technology modernization — moving from legacy operational practices to cloud-native infrastructure, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and infrastructure-as-code.

AT&T's DevOps culture is evolving rapidly. The company has invested in cloud partnerships (primarily Microsoft Azure), containerization, and modern deployment practices. DevOps Engineers who can drive this transformation while maintaining the reliability of critical telecommunications infrastructure are highly valued.
