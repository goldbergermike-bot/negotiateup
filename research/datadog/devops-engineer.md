#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Datadog

Datadog's February 10, 2026 blowout earnings validated the company's position as the essential platform for cloud-native operations. For DevOps Engineers, this is more than a financial milestone — it confirms that the market values operational excellence, and Datadog is the company that delivers it. DevOps Engineers at Datadog don't just use observability tools; they build and operate the observability platform itself, including the rapidly expanding LLM Observability product line.

The 1,000+ LLM Observability customer milestone, announced during the February 10, 2026 earnings, signals that AI workload operations are becoming a mainstream DevOps concern. Enterprises need DevOps Engineers who understand how to deploy, monitor, and scale LLM inference infrastructure — and Datadog is building the tools they use. If you join Datadog as a DevOps Engineer, you are working at the center of this transformation, and the AI Nervous System vision means this role only grows in strategic importance.

Datadog's internal infrastructure is among the most sophisticated in the industry — multi-cloud, multi-region, processing trillions of data points per day with stringent uptime requirements. DevOps Engineers who can operate at this scale bring skills that are scarce and valuable.

### 🧠 Datadog LLM Observability & AI Nervous System Lever

Datadog's February 10, 2026 blowout earnings and 1,000+ LLM customer milestone prove the AI Nervous System thesis. I negotiate for premiums that reflect my ability to scale LLM Observability across the platform. As a DevOps Engineer, you are the operational backbone — ensuring that the AI Nervous System runs reliably at scale across every cloud provider and region.

The AI Nervous System requires DevOps Engineers who understand how to deploy and operate ML inference infrastructure, manage GPU clusters, orchestrate containerized AI workloads, and maintain the observability platform that monitors it all. This is a new frontier for DevOps, and engineers with this combined skill set are rare.

With 1,000+ LLM Observability customers, the operational demands on Datadog's platform are scaling rapidly. New data types, new ingestion patterns, and new performance requirements mean DevOps Engineers are constantly evolving the infrastructure. Use this in negotiations: "Datadog's 1,000+ LLM Observability customers are generating new operational challenges. My DevOps experience in [cloud infrastructure / Kubernetes / ML operations] positions me to keep the AI Nervous System reliable at scale."

The February 10, 2026 blowout earnings prove the business is accelerating. Every customer added increases the operational complexity of the platform. Negotiate with this framing: "Datadog's growth trajectory, confirmed by the February 10, 2026 blowout earnings, means operational excellence is a strategic advantage. I bring the DevOps expertise to maintain that excellence as the platform scales to support the AI Nervous System."

#### Global Lever 1: Infrastructure Monitoring at Scale

DevOps Engineers who have operated large-scale monitoring infrastructure bring direct value. Negotiate on operational expertise: "I have operated infrastructure monitoring systems with [X] uptime across [Y] regions. At Datadog, this operational discipline directly translates to platform reliability that affects every customer."

#### Global Lever 2: APM & Distributed Tracing

APM infrastructure requires DevOps Engineers who understand trace ingestion pipelines, data storage at scale, and query performance optimization. Negotiate on infrastructure knowledge: "I have managed APM infrastructure processing [X] spans per second. At Datadog, this experience maps to maintaining the backend systems that power the APM product."

#### Global Lever 3: Security & SIEM Expansion

Cloud SIEM operations require DevOps Engineers who understand security compliance, log retention policies, and audit requirements. Frame the value: "Operating Cloud SIEM infrastructure requires specialized DevOps knowledge of compliance and security requirements. My experience in [SOC2 / HIPAA / FedRAMP] environments positions me to support Datadog's security product expansion."

#### Global Lever 4: LLM Observability & AI Monitoring

LLM Observability operations introduce new challenges: GPU infrastructure management, ML model serving, and AI-specific data pipelines. With 1,000+ customers, these operational challenges are scaling rapidly: "Datadog's 1,000+ LLM Observability customers depend on operational reliability. My experience in [ML operations / GPU infrastructure / AI pipelines] maps directly to scaling the AI Nervous System. The February 10, 2026 blowout earnings confirm the urgency."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $185,000 base with 800 RSUs ($112,000 at current DDOG price ~$140). Your accept-at floor should be $250,000 total comp. Cite the February 10, 2026 blowout earnings, the 1,000+ LLM customer milestone, and your ability to operate the AI Nervous System infrastructure at scale. For Paris, open at €70,000 base; for Dublin, open at €75,000 base, with equivalent RSU grants.
