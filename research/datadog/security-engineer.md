#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Datadog

Datadog's February 10, 2026 blowout earnings showcased the company's expanding security product portfolio — Cloud SIEM, Cloud Security Management, and Application Security Management — as key growth drivers. For Security Engineers, this earnings report validates that security is not an afterthought at Datadog; it is a core product pillar and a massive market opportunity. Security Engineers who can build these products and protect the platform itself are in a position of dual leverage.

The 1,000+ LLM Observability customer milestone, announced alongside the February 10, 2026 earnings, adds a new security dimension. LLM workloads introduce novel security risks — prompt injection, model poisoning, data exfiltration through AI pipelines — that require security engineers who understand both traditional cloud security and emerging AI threat models. Datadog's AI Nervous System must be secure by design, and security engineers who can ensure this command a significant premium.

Security talent is structurally scarce across the industry, and Datadog competes with both tech companies and dedicated security firms for the same candidates. This structural scarcity, combined with the strategic importance of security products to Datadog's growth, drives compensation above market for comparable roles.

#### Datadog Level Mapping & Internal Titles

### 🧠 Datadog LLM Observability & AI Nervous System Lever

Datadog's February 10, 2026 blowout earnings and 1,000+ LLM customer milestone prove the AI Nervous System thesis. I negotiate for premiums that reflect my ability to scale LLM Observability across the platform. As a Security Engineer, you ensure that the AI Nervous System is secure, compliant, and resilient — which is not optional for enterprise adoption.

The intersection of security and LLM Observability is a new frontier. AI workloads create novel attack vectors: adversarial prompts, model theft, training data poisoning, and AI-powered reconnaissance. Security Engineers who understand these threats and can build defenses into the observability platform are extraordinarily valuable. Use this in negotiations: "LLM Observability introduces security challenges that most companies haven't addressed yet. I bring [AI security / threat modeling / adversarial ML] expertise that is directly relevant to securing the AI Nervous System."

With 1,000+ LLM Observability customers, the security surface area of Datadog's platform has expanded significantly. Each new customer brings new data types, new compliance requirements, and new threat models. Security Engineers must stay ahead of this expanding attack surface while enabling the platform to scale.

The February 10, 2026 blowout earnings confirm that Datadog's security products are gaining market traction. Negotiate with dual leverage: "I contribute both to platform security and to building the Cloud SIEM products that drive revenue. The February 10, 2026 blowout earnings confirm that security is a growth vector, and my compensation should reflect this dual value."

#### Global Lever 1: Infrastructure Monitoring at Scale

Securing infrastructure monitoring at Datadog's scale — trillions of data points per day, multi-tenant, multi-cloud — is a massive security challenge. Negotiate on security-at-scale expertise: "I have secured infrastructure monitoring systems processing [X] events per day. At Datadog, this experience directly translates to platform security improvements that protect every customer."

#### Global Lever 2: APM & Distributed Tracing

APM security involves protecting trace data, ensuring data isolation across tenants, and preventing information leakage through distributed tracing. Negotiate on APM security knowledge: "I have secured APM and tracing infrastructure serving [X] customers. At Datadog, this maps to ensuring the security and privacy of the APM product."

#### Global Lever 3: Security & SIEM Expansion

This is your primary product lever. Cloud SIEM, CSM, and ASM are high-growth security products that you will help build: "I am a Security Engineer who also builds security products. At Datadog, this means I contribute to both platform security and the Cloud SIEM revenue stream. This dual role creates outsized value."

#### Global Lever 4: LLM Observability & AI Monitoring

Securing LLM Observability is the frontier of AI security. With 1,000+ customers, Datadog must ensure that LLM telemetry data — which may contain sensitive prompts and model outputs — is handled securely: "Datadog's 1,000+ LLM Observability customers entrust the platform with sensitive AI data. I bring the security expertise to protect this data and build compliance controls that enterprise customers require. The February 10, 2026 blowout earnings and the AI Nervous System vision depend on security as a foundation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $225,000 base with 1,300 RSUs ($182,000 at current DDOG price ~$140). Your accept-at floor should be $330,000 total comp. Cite the February 10, 2026 blowout earnings, the 1,000+ LLM customer milestone, and your ability to secure the AI Nervous System while building Cloud SIEM products. For Paris, open at €85,000 base; for Dublin, open at €90,000 base, with equivalent RSU grants.
