### Technical Program Manager | Qualcomm Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Mobile & Edge AI Silicon | Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine | +10% AI/Agentic Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego | $125K–$165K | $40K–$62K | 10–15% | $182K–$252K |
| Santa Clara | $138K–$180K | $45K–$68K | 10–15% | $200K–$275K |
| Remote US | $115K–$150K | $35K–$56K | 10–15% | $165K–$228K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Qualcomm orchestrate the most complex cross-functional programs in the semiconductor industry — coordinating hardware design, firmware development, software platform delivery, AI model integration, and OEM qualification across 18–36 month development cycles. Unlike TPMs at software companies who manage sprint cadences, Qualcomm TPMs manage programs where silicon tape-out deadlines are immovable, hardware-software co-design dependencies are intricate, and a single missed milestone can cascade into hundreds of millions in delayed revenue. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine's agentic AI capabilities add a new dimension — coordinating AI model optimization, agent runtime development, and OEM agentic AI enablement programs simultaneously (Source: Qualcomm FY2024 10-K, Qualcomm Careers).

**Level Mapping:**
- Qualcomm TPM (P4–P5) = Google L5 TPM = Meta TPM (IC5) = Apple TPM = Microsoft TPM 62–63 = Amazon Sr. TPM

**Agentic Edge — The On-Device Agency Premium**

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enables on-device agentic AI — autonomous AI agents running locally on phones, laptops, and edge devices without cloud dependency. As a Technical Program Manager, you are the orchestrator of Qualcomm's most strategic cross-functional initiative — bringing agentic AI from silicon design to shipping product. You coordinate the NPU hardware team's agent acceleration features, the AI runtime team's agent execution framework, the SDK team's developer tools, and the OEM enablement team's integration support into a single coherent program that ships on schedule. The program complexity is extraordinary — agentic AI touches every layer of the Snapdragon stack, and a TPM who can hold the full picture while managing dependencies across hardware and software timelines is irreplaceable. Negotiate a 20–30% Agentic Edge premium by positioning yourself as the program leader who can drive the most consequential cross-functional initiative in Qualcomm's history to on-time delivery. The scarcity of TPMs who understand both semiconductor program management and AI platform delivery is acute.

**Global Levers**

1. **Hardware-Software Program Complexity:** "My experience managing programs that span hardware design, firmware, and software delivery — with immovable tape-out deadlines — maps directly to Qualcomm's uniquely complex program management requirements. I've shipped X programs with cross-functional dependencies of this magnitude."
2. **AI Platform Program Management:** "I've managed AI/ML platform programs including model optimization pipelines, inference runtime delivery, and developer SDK launches. This directly applies to Snapdragon's agentic AI program coordination needs."
3. **Competing TPM Offers:** "I have TPM offers from Google ($268K TC) and Apple ($255K TC). Qualcomm's program complexity exceeds both — you're coordinating silicon, firmware, software, AI, and OEM enablement simultaneously — and the comp should reflect that."
4. **Revenue Protection Value:** "A TPM who keeps the Snapdragon program on schedule protects hundreds of millions in OEM revenue commitments. The cost of program delays — lost OEM design wins, missed market windows — dwarfs the comp delta between your current offer and my ask."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my competing offers from Google TPM ($268K TC) and Apple TPM ($255K TC), I'm targeting $245K total comp at Qualcomm. I'd like the base increased from $140K to $158K and the RSU grant from $48K to $62K/4yr. Qualcomm TPM programs are the most complex in tech — coordinating across silicon, firmware, AI, and OEM timelines simultaneously. The agentic AI program adds another layer of cross-functional complexity. My accept-at floor is $225K total comp. Below that, the significantly simpler program scopes at FAANG with higher pay become the rational choice."
