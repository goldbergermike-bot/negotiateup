### Data Engineer | Qualcomm Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Mobile & Edge AI Silicon | Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine | +10% AI/Agentic Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego | $128K–$168K | $40K–$65K | 10–15% | $185K–$258K |
| Santa Clara | $140K–$185K | $45K–$72K | 10–15% | $202K–$282K |
| Remote US | $115K–$152K | $36K–$58K | 10–15% | $168K–$232K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Qualcomm build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers silicon design analytics, AI model training pipelines, chip performance benchmarking, and business intelligence across the Snapdragon ecosystem. Unlike data engineering at software companies, Qualcomm's data challenges involve hardware telemetry from billions of devices, silicon simulation datasets measured in petabytes, and AI model performance data across hundreds of Snapdragon SKU configurations. With the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enabling on-device agentic AI, data engineers now build the pipelines that collect, process, and analyze agent behavior telemetry at global scale (Source: Qualcomm FY2024 10-K, Qualcomm Data Infrastructure team descriptions).

**Level Mapping:**
- Qualcomm DE (E4–E5) = Google L4 DE = Meta DE (IC4) = Apple DE = Microsoft DE 61–62 = Amazon DE III

**Agentic Edge — The On-Device Agency Premium**

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enables on-device agentic AI — autonomous AI agents running locally on phones, laptops, and edge devices without cloud dependency. As a Data Engineer, you are building the data infrastructure that makes agentic AI development, optimization, and monitoring possible at Qualcomm's scale. You architect the telemetry pipelines that collect agent behavior data from billions of edge devices while respecting on-device privacy constraints; you build the data lakes that store agent performance metrics across thousands of device configurations; you design the real-time streaming architectures that enable Qualcomm's AI teams to monitor and optimize agent behavior patterns globally. The unique challenge is building data infrastructure for a paradigm where the data is generated on-device, not in the cloud — requiring novel approaches to federated data collection, edge analytics, and privacy-preserving telemetry. Negotiate a 20–30% Agentic Edge premium by positioning yourself as the data infrastructure architect for edge-native AI analytics — a discipline that is being invented in real-time.

**Global Levers**

1. **Edge Data Infrastructure Expertise:** "My experience building data pipelines for edge computing environments — including device telemetry collection, federated analytics, and privacy-preserving data aggregation — maps directly to Qualcomm's unique data engineering challenges."
2. **AI/ML Data Pipeline Experience:** "I've built end-to-end ML data pipelines — from training data preparation to model performance monitoring — at petabyte scale. This directly accelerates my impact on Snapdragon's AI model optimization data infrastructure."
3. **Competing DE Offers:** "I have data engineering offers from Google ($272K TC) and Meta ($260K TC). Qualcomm's data engineering challenges — hardware telemetry, edge data collection, AI workload analytics — are more technically demanding than cloud-native data engineering."
4. **Scale & Complexity Premium:** "Qualcomm's data infrastructure serves a device ecosystem of 2B+ annual chip shipments. Building reliable data pipelines at this scale, with hardware-level telemetry and AI workload characterization, demands a premium over standard cloud data engineering."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my competing offers from Google DE ($272K TC) and Meta DE ($260K TC), I'm targeting $250K total comp at Qualcomm. I'd like the base increased from $140K to $160K and the RSU grant from $48K to $65K/4yr. Building data infrastructure for on-device agentic AI telemetry — privacy-preserving, edge-native, at billion-device scale — is a challenge that doesn't exist at cloud-first companies. My accept-at floor is $230K total comp. Below that, the simpler data engineering at FAANG with higher pay becomes the rational choice."
