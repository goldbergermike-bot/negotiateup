### Product Manager | Qualcomm Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Mobile & Edge AI Silicon | Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine | +10% AI/Agentic Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego | $148K–$192K | $48K–$78K | 12–18% | $215K–$298K |
| Santa Clara | $160K–$208K | $55K–$85K | 12–18% | $235K–$325K |
| Remote US | $135K–$175K | $42K–$70K | 12–18% | $195K–$270K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Qualcomm sit at the intersection of silicon capability, OEM requirements, and developer ecosystem growth — defining what Snapdragon can do, how it's positioned, and which features ship in which generation. Unlike pure-software PMs, Qualcomm PMs must navigate 18–36 month hardware development cycles while responding to fast-moving AI market dynamics. With the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine introducing on-device agentic AI, PMs are defining entirely new product categories — agent-capable devices — and building the go-to-market strategy that positions Qualcomm ahead of Apple, MediaTek, and Samsung in the agentic edge market (Source: Qualcomm FY2024 10-K, Qualcomm Snapdragon Summit 2025).

**Level Mapping:**
- Qualcomm PM (P3–P4) = Google L5 PM = Meta PM (IC5) = Apple PM = Microsoft PM 62–63 = Amazon Sr. PMT

**Agentic Edge — The On-Device Agency Premium**

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enables on-device agentic AI — autonomous AI agents running locally on phones, laptops, and edge devices without cloud dependency. As a Product Manager, you are defining the product vision for on-device agency — determining which agent capabilities ship in Snapdragon, how they're exposed to OEMs and developers, and what the competitive moat looks like against Apple Intelligence and Google's on-device AI. You own the product requirements that translate "agentic AI" from a research concept into a billion-device reality. This requires a PM who understands AI model architectures, silicon constraints, and developer ecosystem dynamics simultaneously — a rare combination. Negotiate a 20–30% Agentic Edge premium by framing yourself as the product leader who can turn Qualcomm's silicon advantage into an agentic platform advantage. The PM who gets this right defines a new computing category.

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Product Strategy:** "I've shipped platform products that required coordinating hardware capabilities, developer APIs, and OEM integration requirements simultaneously — exactly the skillset Snapdragon's agentic AI platform needs to succeed against Apple Intelligence."
2. **AI/ML Product Expertise:** "My product experience in AI/ML — from model deployment pipelines to inference optimization — gives me the technical depth to make informed tradeoff decisions on Snapdragon's AI Engine product roadmap without constant engineering translation."
3. **Competing PM Offers:** "I have PM offers from Google ($310K TC) and Meta ($295K TC). Qualcomm's agentic edge opportunity is uniquely differentiated, but the comp package needs to reflect the strategic importance of this PM role."
4. **Market-Defining Opportunity:** "This PM role isn't maintaining an existing product — it's defining a new category. Category-defining PM work commands a premium because the strategic impact is exponentially higher than incremental feature delivery."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my competing offers from Google PM ($310K TC) and Meta PM ($295K TC), I'm targeting $290K total comp at Qualcomm. I'd like the base increased from $165K to $185K and the RSU grant from $60K to $78K/4yr. The agentic edge PM role is category-defining — there's no existing playbook, and the PM who ships this right creates a multi-billion dollar platform business. My accept-at floor is $265K total comp. Below that, the comp gap with pure-software PM roles that carry lower complexity becomes irrational."
