### Software Engineer | Qualcomm Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Mobile & Edge AI Silicon | Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine | +10% AI-Adjacent Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego | $120K–$155K | $40K–$65K | 10–15% | $172K–$235K |
| Santa Clara | $130K–$168K | $45K–$72K | 10–15% | $188K–$255K |
| Remote US | $108K–$140K | $36K–$58K | 10–15% | $155K–$212K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Qualcomm's Software Engineers form the foundational layer of the Snapdragon ecosystem, writing the firmware, drivers, and platform software that powers billions of mobile, automotive, and IoT devices globally. With the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine pushing on-device agentic AI into mass production, every SWE at Qualcomm is now contributing to the most consequential shift in computing since mobile — the move from cloud-dependent AI to device-native autonomy. Qualcomm reported $38.96B in FY2024 revenue, with QCT (chip licensing) driving the majority, making engineering talent the direct revenue engine (Source: Qualcomm FY2024 10-K).

**Level Mapping:**
- Qualcomm E3–E4 = Google L3–L4 = Meta E3–E4 = Apple ICT2–ICT3 = Microsoft SDE 59–61

**Agentic Edge — The On-Device Agency Premium**

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine is the industry's first silicon platform purpose-built for on-device agentic AI — autonomous AI agents that perceive, reason, and act locally on phones, laptops, and edge devices without cloud round-trips. As a Software Engineer at Qualcomm, you are building the runtime environments, driver stacks, and optimization layers that allow these agents to execute with sub-10ms latency on-device. This is not incremental work — it is the infrastructure layer for a new computing paradigm where billions of devices become autonomous agents. Candidates should frame themselves as architects of on-device agency and negotiate a 20–30% Agentic Edge premium over standard SWE offers at peer semiconductor companies. The scarcity of engineers who understand both low-level silicon optimization and AI agent frameworks makes this premium fully defensible.

**Global Levers**

1. **Snapdragon Platform Expertise:** "My experience optimizing software for heterogeneous compute architectures — CPU, GPU, NPU — maps directly to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5's agentic AI pipeline, where efficient resource scheduling across compute blocks is critical for autonomous agent performance."
2. **Competing Silicon Offers:** "I have active offers from Apple Silicon and NVIDIA's embedded division at $X total comp. Qualcomm's unique position in on-device agentic AI is compelling, but the comp needs to reflect the specialized nature of this work."
3. **AI-Adjacent Upskilling:** "I've built proficiency in AI model optimization and on-device inference frameworks like TensorFlow Lite and ONNX Runtime, which directly accelerates my ramp-up on Snapdragon AI Engine workloads."
4. **Geographic Arbitrage:** "While San Diego's cost of living is lower than the Bay Area, Qualcomm competes for the same global talent pool as Apple, Google, and NVIDIA — the comp should reflect market rates for this caliber of engineering."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my competing offers at $210K–$230K total comp from [Apple/NVIDIA/Google], I'm targeting $225K total comp at Qualcomm. I'd like to see the RSU grant increased from $50K to $65K over four years, and the base moved from $130K to $145K. Given the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 agentic AI workload, this role carries a premium that standard SWE bands don't capture. My accept-at floor is $205K total comp — below that, the competing offers become the rational choice."
