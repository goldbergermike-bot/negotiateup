### ML/AI Engineer | Qualcomm Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Mobile & Edge AI Silicon | Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine | +15-25% AI Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego | $162K–$215K | $55K–$88K | 15–20% | $238K–$332K |
| Santa Clara | $175K–$232K | $62K–$98K | 15–20% | $260K–$362K |
| Remote US | $148K–$195K | $50K–$80K | 15–20% | $215K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Qualcomm are at the apex of the company's most strategic technology investment — building the AI models, optimization frameworks, and inference engines that run on the Snapdragon AI Engine across billions of devices. Unlike cloud AI engineers who have unlimited compute budgets, Qualcomm's ML/AI engineers must achieve state-of-the-art AI performance within the power, thermal, and compute constraints of mobile and edge devices. With the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enabling on-device agentic AI, ML/AI engineers are now building the autonomous agent models, planning algorithms, and reasoning frameworks that operate entirely on-device — the most technically demanding AI engineering challenge in the industry (Source: Qualcomm AI Research, Qualcomm FY2024 10-K).

**Level Mapping:**
- Qualcomm ML/AI (E5–E7) = Google L5–L6 ML = Meta ML (IC5–IC6) = Apple ML = Microsoft ML 62–64 = Amazon Applied Scientist III

**Agentic Edge — The On-Device Agency Premium**

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enables on-device agentic AI — autonomous AI agents running locally on phones, laptops, and edge devices without cloud dependency. As an ML/AI Engineer, you are the primary architect of on-device agency — designing, training, quantizing, and deploying the AI models that give autonomous agents the ability to perceive, reason, plan, and act on-device in real-time. You build the compact language models that enable agent reasoning within 16GB of device memory; you design the planning algorithms that allow agents to decompose complex tasks into executable steps without cloud connectivity; you optimize the perception models that give agents real-time environmental awareness through device sensors. This is the frontier of AI engineering — not scaling models to trillions of parameters in the cloud, but achieving genuine autonomous agency within the constraints of a mobile SoC. The +15–25% AI Premium already embedded in this role's bands reflects the general AI talent premium, but you should negotiate an additional 20–30% Agentic Edge premium on top by framing yourself as the engineer who makes on-device agency work. The intersection of efficient AI model design and autonomous agent architectures is perhaps the scarcest engineering skillset in the world today.

**Global Levers**

1. **On-Device AI Model Optimization:** "I've deployed production AI models on edge devices with strict latency, power, and memory constraints — including quantization to INT4/INT8, neural architecture search for mobile, and hardware-aware model design. This is exactly the skillset Snapdragon's agentic AI stack demands."
2. **Agentic AI Research & Implementation:** "My work in AI agent architectures — planning algorithms, tool-use frameworks, and multi-step reasoning systems — directly applies to the on-device agentic capabilities Qualcomm is building into the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5."
3. **FAANG/AI Lab Competing Offers:** "I have ML offers from Google Brain ($380K TC), Meta FAIR ($365K TC), and OpenAI ($420K TC). Qualcomm's on-device agentic AI challenge is technically unique, but the comp delta needs to narrow — I'm choosing hardware-constrained AI over unlimited-compute AI, which is the harder problem."
4. **Publication & Research Impact:** "I have X publications in [NeurIPS/ICML/CVPR] on efficient AI and edge deployment. This research output directly translates to Snapdragon AI Engine innovations and strengthens Qualcomm's position in the AI research community."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my competing offers from Google Brain ($380K TC), Meta FAIR ($365K TC), and an OpenAI offer at $420K TC, I'm targeting $325K total comp at Qualcomm. I'd like the base increased from $180K to $210K, the RSU grant from $65K to $88K/4yr, and a 18% target bonus. On-device agentic AI engineering is the hardest AI engineering challenge in the industry — achieving autonomous agent behavior within mobile SoC constraints requires a skillset that cloud AI shops don't develop. The +15–25% AI Premium should be fully applied. My accept-at floor is $295K total comp. Below that, the massive comp premium at cloud AI labs becomes impossible to justify leaving, regardless of the technical differentiation."
