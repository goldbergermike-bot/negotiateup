**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Qualcomm are the technical bridge between Snapdragon silicon capabilities and the OEM, enterprise, and developer customers who build on them. You design reference architectures, lead technical enablement for tier-1 OEMs like Samsung, Xiaomi, and OnePlus, and translate Snapdragon's hardware capabilities into deployable solutions across mobile, automotive, IoT, and edge compute. With the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine introducing on-device agentic AI, Solutions Architects are now designing the integration patterns that enable OEMs to deploy autonomous AI agents on their devices — a new solution category requiring deep AI and silicon expertise (Source: Qualcomm FY2024 10-K, Qualcomm Partner Ecosystem reports).

**Level Mapping:**
- Qualcomm SA (E5–E6) = Google L5 Solutions = AWS SA (Senior) = Microsoft CSA 62–63 = Apple SA

**Agentic Edge — The On-Device Agency Premium**

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enables on-device agentic AI — autonomous AI agents running locally on phones, laptops, and edge devices without cloud dependency. As a Solutions Architect, you are designing the reference architectures and integration blueprints that enable OEMs and enterprise customers to deploy agentic AI on Snapdragon-powered devices. You define how Samsung integrates autonomous agents into Galaxy devices; you architect how automotive OEMs deploy agentic AI for in-vehicle experiences; you design the edge computing solutions that enable industrial IoT agents to operate autonomously. Your work directly determines how quickly and broadly on-device agency scales across Qualcomm's ecosystem. Negotiate a 20–30% Agentic Edge premium by positioning yourself as the customer-facing architect who converts Snapdragon's agentic AI capability into OEM adoption and revenue. The intersection of solutions architecture, edge AI, and semiconductor customer enablement is a talent intersection with almost no existing supply.

**Global Levers**

1. **OEM Enablement Track Record:** "I've led technical enablement for tier-1 OEMs, designing reference architectures that accelerated their time-to-market by X months. At Qualcomm, this directly translates to faster OEM adoption of Snapdragon's agentic AI platform."
2. **AI Solutions Architecture:** "My experience designing AI deployment architectures — model optimization, inference pipeline design, and edge-cloud orchestration — maps directly to the agentic AI solutions Qualcomm's OEM partners need."
3. **Competing SA Offers:** "I have Solutions Architect offers from AWS ($290K TC) and Google Cloud ($278K TC). Qualcomm's silicon-level solutions architecture is more technically demanding, and the comp should reflect that depth premium."
4. **Revenue Influence:** "Solutions Architects at Qualcomm directly influence which Snapdragon SKUs OEMs adopt and how deeply they integrate AI capabilities. My enablement work at [previous company] influenced $X in annual platform revenue — this is a revenue-driving role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my competing offers from AWS SA ($290K TC) and Google Cloud SA ($278K TC), I'm targeting $265K total comp at Qualcomm. I'd like the base increased from $150K to $170K and the RSU grant from $50K to $68K/4yr. Qualcomm's SA role requires silicon-level technical depth that cloud SA roles don't — plus the agentic AI enablement layer adds a premium complexity dimension. My accept-at floor is $242K total comp. Below that, the higher comp and lower complexity of cloud SA roles makes this move financially unjustifiable."
