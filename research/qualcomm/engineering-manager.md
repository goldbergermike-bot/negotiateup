### Engineering Manager | Qualcomm Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Mobile & Edge AI Silicon | Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine | +12% AI/Agentic Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego | $185K–$240K | $65K–$105K | 15–20% | $275K–$382K |
| Santa Clara | $200K–$260K | $72K–$115K | 15–20% | $300K–$415K |
| Remote US | $168K–$218K | $58K–$95K | 15–20% | $248K–$345K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Qualcomm lead teams of 8–20 engineers building the software platforms, firmware, and AI capabilities that power Snapdragon across mobile, automotive, XR, and IoT. At Qualcomm, EMs carry significant technical expectations — you are expected to make architectural decisions, conduct code reviews on critical paths, and represent your team's technical direction in cross-org planning. With the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine requiring coordinated execution across NPU firmware, AI runtime, and agent framework teams, EMs are the connective tissue that turns silicon capability into shipping software. Qualcomm's engineering workforce exceeds 35,000 globally, and EMs at the intersection of AI and platform software are among the most contested hires (Source: Qualcomm FY2024 10-K, Qualcomm Careers).

**Level Mapping:**
- Qualcomm EM (M1–M2) = Google L6 EM = Meta M1 = Apple EM = Microsoft EM 64–65 = Amazon SDM

**Agentic Edge — The On-Device Agency Premium**

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enables on-device agentic AI — autonomous AI agents running locally on phones, laptops, and edge devices without cloud dependency. As an Engineering Manager, you are building and leading the teams that make on-device agency a reality at production scale. You recruit and develop the engineers who write the agent runtime code; you make the resource allocation decisions that determine whether the agentic AI roadmap ships on time; you coordinate across hardware, firmware, and software teams to ensure the full agent execution stack works end-to-end. The organizational complexity of shipping agentic AI on billions of devices — coordinating NPU hardware teams, ML framework teams, and OEM integration teams simultaneously — is an EM challenge that few managers in the industry have navigated. Negotiate a 20–30% Agentic Edge premium by positioning yourself as the leader who can orchestrate this cross-functional execution. The scarcity is not just in IC talent — it's in managers who understand both the technical depth of on-device AI and the organizational dynamics of shipping it.

**Global Levers**

1. **Team Building in Scarce Markets:** "I've built and scaled engineering teams in the AI/ML silicon space, where the talent market is the tightest in tech. My last team grew from 5 to 18 engineers with zero regrettable attrition over 24 months — that execution track record has direct P&L impact at Qualcomm."
2. **Cross-Functional Delivery:** "My experience coordinating hardware-software co-design across multiple engineering orgs maps directly to Qualcomm's need to ship the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 agentic AI stack across NPU firmware, AI runtime, and SDK teams."
3. **Competing EM Offers:** "I'm evaluating EM offers from Google ($395K TC) and Apple ($370K TC). Qualcomm's agentic edge mission is the differentiator, but the comp gap needs to narrow for me to make this move."
4. **Retention & Attrition Cost:** "Engineering Manager attrition at Qualcomm creates cascading team instability — losing an EM typically means losing 2–3 senior ICs within 6 months. The cost of that churn dwarfs the comp delta I'm requesting."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $370K total comp based on my competing Google EM offer at $395K and Apple EM offer at $370K. I'd like the base increased from $200K to $225K, the RSU grant from $80K to $105K/4yr, and a 18% target bonus. Managing agentic edge teams requires a rare combination of AI technical depth and hardware-software coordination — this is not a standard EM role. My accept-at floor is $340K total comp. Below that, the comp discount versus FAANG EM roles becomes too steep to justify, even accounting for Qualcomm's mission differentiation."
