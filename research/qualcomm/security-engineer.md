**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Qualcomm protect the hardware root of trust for billions of devices worldwide — from Snapdragon's Secure Processing Unit (SPU) and TrustZone implementation to firmware security, supply chain integrity, and cryptographic protocol design. Unlike security roles at software companies, Qualcomm's security surface extends to silicon-level attacks, side-channel vulnerabilities, and hardware Trojan detection — threats that cannot be patched with a software update. With the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enabling on-device agentic AI, security engineers must now protect autonomous agents from adversarial manipulation, model poisoning, and unauthorized action execution — an entirely new threat surface (Source: Qualcomm FY2024 10-K, Qualcomm Product Security publications).

**Level Mapping:**
- Qualcomm Security (E4–E6) = Google L4–L5 Security = Meta Security (IC4–IC5) = Apple Security = Microsoft Security 61–63

**Agentic Edge — The On-Device Agency Premium**

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enables on-device agentic AI — autonomous AI agents running locally on phones, laptops, and edge devices without cloud dependency. As a Security Engineer, you are defining the trust and safety architecture for on-device autonomous agents — the most consequential security challenge in consumer electronics today. You design the permission models that constrain what autonomous agents can do; you build the isolation boundaries that prevent one agent from compromising another; you architect the attestation frameworks that prove an agent hasn't been tampered with; you protect the AI models from adversarial extraction and manipulation. If agentic AI fails on security, it fails entirely — a rogue agent on a consumer's phone is a catastrophic trust event. Negotiate a 20–30% Agentic Edge premium by framing yourself as the gatekeeper of on-device agency trust. The intersection of hardware security engineering and AI agent safety is a talent pool that essentially doesn't exist yet — you are defining the field.

**Global Levers**

1. **Hardware Security Expertise:** "My experience in hardware root of trust design, side-channel analysis, and secure boot implementation maps directly to Snapdragon's Secure Processing Unit architecture. This isn't software security — it's silicon-level trust infrastructure."
2. **AI Security Specialization:** "I've worked on AI model security — adversarial robustness, model extraction prevention, and inference-time safety constraints — which directly applies to the agentic AI security challenges the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 introduces."
3. **Competing Security Offers:** "I have security engineering offers from Google ($305K TC) and Apple ($290K TC). Qualcomm's hardware security challenge is more technically demanding, and the agentic AI safety layer adds a dimension that doesn't exist at those companies yet."
4. **Risk & Liability Framing:** "A security failure in Snapdragon's agentic AI stack would affect billions of devices with no ability to recall hardware. The liability exposure of getting this wrong dwarfs the comp investment in getting the right security engineer."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my competing offers from Google Security ($305K TC) and Apple Security ($290K TC), I'm targeting $280K total comp at Qualcomm. I'd like the base increased from $155K to $180K and the RSU grant from $58K to $75K/4yr. Securing autonomous on-device agents is the hardest unsolved problem in consumer device security — the engineer who builds this trust architecture protects Qualcomm's brand across billions of devices. My accept-at floor is $258K total comp. Below that, the simpler security surfaces at pure-software companies with higher comp become the obvious choice."
