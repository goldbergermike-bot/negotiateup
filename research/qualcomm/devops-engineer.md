**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Qualcomm manage some of the most complex CI/CD and build infrastructure in the semiconductor industry — orchestrating compilation pipelines for firmware, drivers, and platform software that must be validated across hundreds of Snapdragon SKU configurations, OEM device variants, and AI model deployment targets. Unlike cloud-native DevOps, Qualcomm's infrastructure must handle hardware-in-the-loop testing, silicon emulation environments, and AI model validation pipelines that are orders of magnitude more complex than typical software build systems. With the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine adding agentic AI workloads, DevOps engineers now manage the CI/CD for agent runtime deployment, model optimization pipelines, and cross-device agent validation (Source: Qualcomm FY2024 10-K, Qualcomm Engineering Blog).

**Level Mapping:**
- Qualcomm DevOps (E4–E5) = Google L4 SRE = Meta Production Engineer (IC4) = Apple DevOps = Microsoft SRE 61–62

**Agentic Edge — The On-Device Agency Premium**

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enables on-device agentic AI — autonomous AI agents running locally on phones, laptops, and edge devices without cloud dependency. As a DevOps Engineer, you are building the deployment and validation infrastructure that ensures agentic AI capabilities ship reliably on billions of devices. You architect the CI/CD pipelines that validate agent runtime behavior across Snapdragon configurations; you build the automated testing frameworks that ensure autonomous agents perform correctly on every supported device; you create the model deployment infrastructure that pushes optimized agent models to OEM production lines. The complexity of validating autonomous agent behavior across thousands of device configurations — where a bug means an agent acting incorrectly on a consumer's phone — demands DevOps sophistication that pure-software CI/CD doesn't approach. Negotiate a 20–30% Agentic Edge premium by positioning yourself as the infrastructure architect for safe, reliable agentic AI deployment at scale.

**Global Levers**

1. **Hardware-Software CI/CD Expertise:** "My experience building CI/CD pipelines that integrate hardware-in-the-loop testing, silicon emulation, and cross-platform firmware validation maps directly to Qualcomm's uniquely complex build infrastructure requirements."
2. **AI/ML Pipeline Infrastructure:** "I've built ML model deployment pipelines and automated AI validation frameworks that are directly applicable to Snapdragon's agentic AI model delivery and testing infrastructure."
3. **Competing DevOps/SRE Offers:** "I have SRE offers from Google ($270K TC) and Meta ($258K TC). Qualcomm's hardware-AI DevOps challenge is more complex than cloud-native infrastructure, and the comp should reflect that complexity."
4. **Scale & Reliability Impact:** "DevOps failures at Qualcomm don't just cause downtime — they delay chip tape-outs and OEM shipments worth hundreds of millions. The reliability I bring to Snapdragon's build infrastructure has direct revenue protection value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my competing offers from Google SRE ($270K TC) and Meta Production Engineer ($258K TC), I'm targeting $248K total comp at Qualcomm. I'd like the base increased from $140K to $160K and the RSU grant from $48K to $62K/4yr. Qualcomm's DevOps complexity — hardware-in-the-loop, silicon validation, plus agentic AI model deployment — exceeds standard cloud DevOps by a significant margin. My accept-at floor is $228K total comp. Below that, the premium for less complex cloud-native DevOps roles at FAANG makes this move irrational."
