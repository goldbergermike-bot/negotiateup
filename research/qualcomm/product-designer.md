**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Qualcomm shape the developer experience, tooling interfaces, and end-user interaction patterns for the Snapdragon platform ecosystem. Unlike consumer-facing design roles at software companies, Qualcomm designers work at the platform level — creating the design systems, SDK interfaces, and visualization tools that OEMs, developers, and chipset integrators use to build on Snapdragon. With the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine introducing agentic AI capabilities, designers are now defining how humans interact with autonomous on-device agents — a UX challenge with no established patterns (Source: Qualcomm Developer Network, Qualcomm FY2024 10-K).

**Level Mapping:**
- Qualcomm D3–D4 = Google L4 UX = Meta D (IC4) = Apple Design = Microsoft Design 60–62

**Agentic Edge — The On-Device Agency Premium**

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enables on-device agentic AI — autonomous AI agents running locally on phones, laptops, and edge devices without cloud dependency. As a Product Designer, you are defining the human-agent interaction paradigm for on-device agency. How do users grant permissions to autonomous agents? How do agents communicate their actions, reasoning, and uncertainty to users in real-time? How do multi-agent interactions surface on a 6-inch screen? These are design problems that don't exist in cloud-based AI — they are unique to the on-device agentic paradigm Qualcomm is pioneering. You are designing the trust layer between humans and autonomous device-native agents, and getting this right is the difference between consumer adoption and rejection. Negotiate a 20–30% Agentic Edge premium by positioning yourself as the designer who can make agentic AI trustworthy and usable. The intersection of AI interaction design and edge computing UX is a nascent field with almost no established talent pool.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Interaction Design Expertise:** "My portfolio includes AI-powered product design — conversational interfaces, intelligent automation flows, and trust-calibration patterns. This directly maps to the agentic AI interaction challenges Qualcomm's Snapdragon platform faces."
2. **Platform/Developer Experience Design:** "I specialize in developer-facing and platform-level design — SDK documentation UX, API visualization tools, and developer onboarding flows — which is the core design challenge at Qualcomm."
3. **Competing Design Offers:** "I have design offers from Google ($240K TC) and Apple ($225K TC). Qualcomm's agentic edge design challenge is uniquely interesting, but the comp needs to reflect the specialized nature of AI interaction design."
4. **Design System Impact:** "The design systems I create at Qualcomm will be adopted by thousands of OEM and developer partners building on Snapdragon. This multiplicative impact justifies premium compensation versus single-product design roles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my competing offers from Google UX ($240K TC) and Apple Design ($225K TC), I'm targeting $215K total comp at Qualcomm. I'd like the base increased from $125K to $142K and the RSU grant from $40K to $52K/4yr. Designing the human-agent interaction layer for on-device agentic AI is a novel, high-stakes design challenge — the patterns I define will ship on billions of devices. My accept-at floor is $195K total comp. Below that, the premium I'd earn at a pure-software company for simpler design problems makes the move irrational."
