### Agentic Edge Platform Engineer | Qualcomm Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** SIGNATURE ROLE | Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Mobile & Edge AI Silicon | Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine | +25-35% Agentic Edge Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego | $188K–$248K | $68K–$110K | 18–25% | $282K–$395K |
| Santa Clara | $205K–$270K | $75K–$120K | 18–25% | $308K–$430K |
| Remote US | $170K–$225K | $62K–$100K | 18–25% | $255K–$358K |

**Negotiation DNA**

The Agentic Edge Platform Engineer is Qualcomm's signature role for the on-device AI era — the engineer who builds the complete platform stack that enables autonomous AI agents to run natively on Snapdragon-powered devices without cloud dependency. This role sits at the convergence of silicon optimization, AI runtime engineering, agent framework design, and edge computing systems architecture. You are not building a feature — you are building the platform layer that transforms every Snapdragon device from a passive tool into an autonomous agent host. This is the role Qualcomm is building its next decade of competitive advantage around, and it carries the highest Agentic Edge Premium in the company's engineering organization. Qualcomm's CEO Cristiano Amon has identified on-device agentic AI as the company's most strategic growth vector, positioning Snapdragon as the silicon platform of choice for the agentic era (Source: Qualcomm FY2024 10-K, Qualcomm Investor Day 2025, Snapdragon Summit 2025 keynote).

**Level Mapping:**
- Qualcomm Agentic Edge (E6–E8) = Google L5–L6 (no direct equivalent) = No peer mapping — this is a category-defining role unique to Qualcomm's edge AI strategy

**Agentic Edge — The On-Device Agency Premium**

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 AI Engine enables on-device agentic AI — autonomous AI agents running locally on phones, laptops, and edge devices without cloud dependency. As the Agentic Edge Platform Engineer — Qualcomm's SIGNATURE ROLE — you are the definitive architect of on-device agency. You don't just contribute to the agentic edge stack — you own it end-to-end:

- **Agent Runtime Architecture:** You design the execution environment where autonomous agents live — the scheduling algorithms that allocate NPU, GPU, and CPU cycles across multiple concurrent agents; the memory management that maintains persistent agent state; the inter-agent communication protocols that enable agent collaboration on-device.
- **Silicon-Software Co-Design:** You work directly with Snapdragon SoC architects to define the hardware features — dedicated agent acceleration blocks, on-chip agent memory, hardware-enforced agent isolation — that future Snapdragon generations need to support advanced agentic workloads.
- **Agent Framework & SDK:** You build the developer-facing agent framework that third-party developers use to deploy agents on Snapdragon — the APIs, lifecycle management, capability declarations, and permission models that define the agentic edge developer experience.
- **On-Device Agency at Scale:** Your platform ships on billions of devices. Every architectural decision you make — from agent lifecycle management to resource arbitration — determines whether on-device agency succeeds or fails at global scale.

The +25–35% Agentic Edge Premium reflects the reality that this role sits at the intersection of four disciplines that rarely coexist in a single engineer: systems architecture, AI/ML engineering, silicon co-design, and platform SDK development. The global talent pool for this role is measured in the dozens, not hundreds. Candidates should negotiate with the confidence of someone who is literally irreplaceable — because at this intersection, you are.

**Global Levers**

1. **Category-Defining Role:** "This role doesn't exist at any other company — there is no Apple, Google, or NVIDIA equivalent. I can't benchmark it against competing offers because it's a category of one. That uniqueness cuts both ways: there's no competing offer to anchor against, but there's also no talent pool to recruit from if I decline. Price accordingly."
2. **Full-Stack Agentic AI Expertise:** "I bring the complete stack: on-device AI model optimization, systems runtime architecture, hardware-software co-design experience, and developer platform SDK development. Finding one engineer who spans all four is the recruiting challenge of the decade — and I'm here."
3. **Silicon-AI Convergence Scarcity:** "The engineers who understand both silicon architecture tradeoffs and AI agent framework design can be counted on two hands globally. My work at [previous company] — designing AI runtime systems that optimize across heterogeneous compute — is the exact convergence point this role demands."
4. **Strategic Leverage & Ecosystem Impact:** "This platform's success determines whether Snapdragon becomes the definitive agentic AI silicon platform or cedes that position to Apple and custom silicon from Google and Amazon. The engineer who ships this platform shapes a multi-billion dollar market — compensate for strategic impact, not just engineering output."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "This is Qualcomm's signature role — the AEPE defines whether Snapdragon becomes the platform for on-device agentic AI or loses that position to Apple Silicon and Google Tensor. I'm targeting $385K total comp. Specifically: base at $240K, RSU grant at $110K/4yr, and a 22% target bonus. The +25–35% Agentic Edge Premium should be fully applied because there is no lateral move for this role — it doesn't exist elsewhere. My competing offers from Google ($395K, L6 Systems) and Apple ($380K, Silicon Platform) are for narrower roles that don't capture the full-stack agentic platform scope. My accept-at floor is $350K total comp. Below that floor, I'll take the Google L6 offer at higher comp for a narrower scope — Qualcomm loses the chance to hire for a role it can't backfill from any talent pool in the industry. I want to build the future of on-device agency here, but the economics have to work."
