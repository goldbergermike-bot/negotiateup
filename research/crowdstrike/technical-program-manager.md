### Technical Program Manager — CrowdStrike Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Technical Program Managers at CrowdStrike drive cross-functional execution of the Agentic Security Platform, coordinating the engineering, product, and operations teams delivering Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC at enterprise scale.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Austin (USD) | Sunnyvale (USD) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $145,000–$185,000 | $160,000–$205,000 | £73,000–£93,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $190,000–$250,000 | $210,000–$275,000 | £95,000–£128,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $245,000–$325,000 | $270,000–$355,000 | £125,000–£165,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus. CrowdStrike RSUs vest quarterly after a 1-year cliff. TPMs at senior levels should expect RSU grants of 1,000-2,200 shares ($350,000-$770,000 at CRWD ~$350+). TPM bonuses at CrowdStrike typically target 12-18% of base salary.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at CrowdStrike

Technical Program Managers at CrowdStrike coordinate the delivery of the most complex, cross-functional platform initiatives in cybersecurity. The Falcon platform spans 28+ security modules, and the January 28 Agentic Security Platform announcement added the most ambitious initiative yet — building the Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC. TPMs are the connective tissue ensuring these teams deliver cohesive, integrated capabilities on schedule.

CrowdStrike's $245M Q3 net income demonstrates the commercial urgency behind the Agentic SOC initiative — the company has the revenue to invest and the market pressure to deliver. TPMs who can drive execution across 10+ engineering teams with competing priorities are essential to meeting these timelines.

The scarcity of TPMs with both cybersecurity domain expertise and AI/ML program management experience creates significant negotiation leverage. CrowdStrike's RSU packages at this level reflect the strategic importance of program execution to the Agentic Security Platform's success.

#### CrowdStrike Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Technical Program Manager | 3–7 years |
| L5 | Senior Technical Program Manager | 7–12 years |
| L6 | Principal Technical Program Manager | 12–18 years |
| L7 | Director, Technical Program Management | 18+ years |

### 🤖 CrowdStrike Agentic Security Platform & SOC Orchestrator Lever

CrowdStrike's January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch created the most ambitious cross-functional program in the company's history. The Agentic SOC is not a single team's deliverable — it requires coordinated execution across endpoint protection, identity security, cloud security, threat intelligence, LogScale, Charlotte AI, and entirely new Orchestrator teams. TPMs own the program structure, milestones, dependencies, and risk management for this initiative.

The $245M Q3 income provides the budget and organizational urgency to execute aggressively. TPMs managing the Agentic SOC program coordinate unprecedented technical complexity — the Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC must integrate with every Falcon module's API surface, and Charlotte AI adds additional ML/AI coordination requirements.

Use this negotiation framing: "CrowdStrike's January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch and $245M Q3 income prove the company is investing massively in autonomous security. I negotiate as an Orchestrator of the Agentic SOC who manages AI agent fleets at scale."

TPMs should highlight their experience managing complex platform programs with 10+ dependent teams, navigating AI/ML delivery timelines, and driving execution for initiatives with executive-level visibility — all directly applicable to the Agentic Security Platform program.

#### Global Lever 1: Falcon Platform & Endpoint Dominance

The Falcon platform's 28+ modules create extraordinary program complexity. Negotiate by citing coordination scale: "The Falcon platform's module count creates a program management complexity that rivals the largest platform programs at hyperscaler companies. My ability to coordinate across this many teams is a scarce skill."

#### Global Lever 2: Charlotte AI & Generative Security

Charlotte AI programs involve coordinating ML engineering, data science, product, legal, and compliance teams. Negotiate accordingly: "Charlotte AI program management requires multi-dimensional coordination — ML engineering, product, legal, compliance, and AI safety. This complexity is rare and commands a premium."

#### Global Lever 3: Cloud-Native Security & CNAPP

CrowdStrike's cloud-native programs require TPMs with genuine technical understanding. Negotiate with depth: "CrowdStrike's cloud-native programs require TPMs who understand distributed systems and cloud infrastructure at a technical level, not just at a project management level."

#### Global Lever 4: Threat Intelligence & Identity Protection

Threat intelligence programs require security domain knowledge alongside program management. Negotiate with dual expertise: "Managing programs that operationalize threat intelligence requires understanding both the technical systems and the security domain. This dual expertise justifies above-market compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $210,000 base with 1,200 RSUs ($420,000 at CRWD ~$350). Accept-at floor: $340,000 total comp. Cite the January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch, $245M Q3 income, and your role as an Orchestrator of the Agentic SOC.
