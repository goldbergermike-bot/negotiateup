### ML/AI Engineer — CrowdStrike Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers at CrowdStrike build and deploy the machine learning models, AI agent architectures, and inference systems that power the Agentic Security Platform — designing the autonomous Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC that detect, investigate, and respond to threats at machine speed.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Austin (USD) | Sunnyvale (USD) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $170,000–$215,000 | $185,000–$235,000 | £85,000–£108,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $220,000–$290,000 | $240,000–$320,000 | £110,000–£148,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $285,000–$370,000 | $310,000–$405,000 | £145,000–£190,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus. CrowdStrike RSUs vest quarterly after a 1-year cliff. ML/AI engineers command the highest premiums in CrowdStrike's engineering organization — 10-15% above general SWE at equivalent levels. RSU grants of 1,500-3,000 shares ($525,000-$1,050,000 at CRWD ~$350+) are standard at L5+ for AI talent.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at CrowdStrike

ML/AI Engineers at CrowdStrike build the machine learning models and AI systems that are the Falcon platform's core differentiator. The January 28 Agentic Security Platform announcement made ML/AI engineers the most strategically important hire at the company — the Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC are, at their foundation, AI systems that must perceive, reason, decide, and act in dynamic, adversarial environments.

CrowdStrike's $245M Q3 net income validates the commercial value of AI-powered security and funds aggressive AI talent acquisition. The company competes for ML/AI talent against Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta FAIR — the most competitive talent market in technology. CrowdStrike must offer premiums to attract engineers who could work at frontier AI labs.

Your leverage is extraordinary: the intersection of "can build production AI agents" and "understands cybersecurity" is one of the narrowest talent pools in the industry. The Agentic Security Platform requires multi-agent architectures, adversarial robustness, and production inference at security-grade reliability — a combination that few engineers possess.

#### CrowdStrike Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Machine Learning Engineer | 2–6 years |
| L5 | Senior Machine Learning Engineer | 6–10 years |
| L6 | Principal Machine Learning Engineer | 10–15 years |
| L7 | Distinguished ML Engineer | 15+ years |

*ML/AI engineers with experience building autonomous agent systems or multi-agent architectures should push aggressively for L5+ leveling.*

### 🤖 CrowdStrike Agentic Security Platform & SOC Orchestrator Lever

CrowdStrike's January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch makes ML/AI Engineers the most strategically critical hire at the company. The Agentic SOC is, at its foundation, an ML/AI engineering achievement — every Orchestrator is an AI system that must perceive threats, reason about context, decide on actions, and execute responses in adversarial conditions. Building these Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC is the defining ML/AI engineering challenge at CrowdStrike.

The $245M Q3 income demonstrates that CrowdStrike can fund AI research and development at scale. Charlotte AI, the generative security assistant, requires continuous ML/AI engineering — RAG pipeline optimization, tool-use frameworks, safety alignment, and inference serving at security-grade reliability. The Agentic SOC extends this further by requiring multi-agent orchestration, inter-agent communication, and adversarial robustness.

Use this negotiation framing: "CrowdStrike's January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch and $245M Q3 income prove the company is investing massively in autonomous security. I negotiate as an Orchestrator of the Agentic SOC who manages AI agent fleets at scale."

ML/AI Engineers should emphasize their expertise in agent architectures, reinforcement learning, adversarial ML, multi-agent systems, and production inference — all directly applicable to building the Agentic Security Platform's autonomous capabilities.

#### Global Lever 1: Falcon Platform & Endpoint Dominance

Falcon's inference requirements are among the most demanding in enterprise AI. Negotiate by citing scale: "Falcon's inference scale — millions of predictions per second at sub-millisecond latency — is among the most demanding in enterprise AI. My experience building inference systems at comparable scale justifies top-of-market compensation."

#### Global Lever 2: Charlotte AI & Generative Security

Charlotte AI is CrowdStrike's most visible ML/AI investment. Negotiate with applied AI expertise: "Charlotte AI is where applied LLM engineering meets cybersecurity at production scale. I'm building AI systems where errors have real security consequences — the most demanding applied AI challenge in enterprise software."

#### Global Lever 3: Cloud-Native Security & CNAPP

CrowdStrike's cloud-native ML infrastructure enables rapid experimentation. Negotiate with impact amplification: "CrowdStrike's ML infrastructure enables rapid experimentation and deployment. This velocity amplifies my impact, and my compensation should reflect that amplification."

#### Global Lever 4: Threat Intelligence & Identity Protection

ML/AI Engineers train models on the world's richest security dataset. Negotiate with data advantage: "The Threat Graph gives me access to the world's best training data for security ML. Each model I build creates detection capabilities no competitor can match — a direct contribution to CrowdStrike's competitive moat."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $260,000 base with 2,000 RSUs ($700,000 at CRWD ~$350). Accept-at floor: $420,000 total comp. Cite the January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch, $245M Q3 income, and your role as an Orchestrator of the Agentic SOC.
