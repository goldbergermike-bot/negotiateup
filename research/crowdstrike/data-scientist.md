### Data Scientist — CrowdStrike Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Scientists at CrowdStrike build the detection models and behavioral analytics that power the Agentic Security Platform, enabling Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC to make autonomous threat decisions at enterprise scale.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Austin (USD) | Sunnyvale (USD) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $155,000–$195,000 | $170,000–$215,000 | £78,000–£98,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $205,000–$275,000 | $225,000–$305,000 | £103,000–£138,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $265,000–$355,000 | $290,000–$395,000 | £135,000–£178,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus. CrowdStrike RSUs vest quarterly after a 1-year cliff. Data scientists at senior levels should expect RSU grants of 1,200-2,200 shares ($420,000-$770,000 at CRWD ~$350+). Data scientists with ML modeling experience command 10-15% premiums over pure analytics roles.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at CrowdStrike

Data Scientists at CrowdStrike work at the intersection of cybersecurity and advanced analytics, building models on the Threat Graph — the richest proprietary security dataset in the world. The January 28 Agentic Security Platform announcement elevated the importance of data science at the company, as Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC rely on sophisticated detection models, anomaly scoring, and behavioral analytics to make autonomous decisions.

CrowdStrike's $245M Q3 net income is driven in part by the platform's superior detection rates, which are a direct output of data science work. The company's ability to process trillions of events per week and extract actionable threat intelligence creates a data advantage that compounds with every new customer — and Data Scientists are the ones who exploit this advantage.

The demand for Data Scientists with cybersecurity expertise far exceeds supply. CrowdStrike competes with tech giants for statistical modeling and ML talent, offering competitive RSU packages and the unique opportunity to work on problems where model accuracy has real-world security implications.

#### CrowdStrike Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| DS1 (L3-L4) | Data Scientist | 2–6 years |
| DS2 (L5) | Senior / Staff Data Scientist | 6–10 years |
| DS3 (L6) | Principal Data Scientist | 10–15 years |
| DS4 (L7) | Distinguished Data Scientist | 15+ years |

### 🤖 CrowdStrike Agentic Security Platform & SOC Orchestrator Lever

CrowdStrike's January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch is fundamentally a data science initiative. The Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC depend on detection models, behavioral baselines, and anomaly scoring systems that Data Scientists build, validate, and continuously improve. Without accurate models, autonomous security agents cannot make reliable decisions — making Data Scientists essential to the Agentic SOC's success.

The $245M Q3 income demonstrates that CrowdStrike's data-driven approach to security generates real revenue. Data Scientists contribute directly to this outcome by improving detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and enabling Charlotte AI to provide contextual threat analysis. Their work is the intellectual engine of the Agentic Security Platform.

Use this negotiation framing: "CrowdStrike's January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch and $245M Q3 income prove the company is investing massively in autonomous security. I negotiate as an Orchestrator of the Agentic SOC who manages AI agent fleets at scale."

Data Scientists should highlight their expertise in statistical modeling, time-series analysis, adversarial ML, and large-scale experimentation — all directly applicable to the Agentic Security Platform's detection and response capabilities.

#### Global Lever 1: Falcon Platform & Endpoint Dominance

Falcon's detection models are the product. Negotiate by citing analytical impact: "My experience building detection models at scale — including feature engineering from high-volume event streams and managing model drift — directly supports Falcon's industry-leading detection accuracy."

#### Global Lever 2: Charlotte AI & Generative Security

Charlotte AI requires data science expertise for evaluation and improvement. Leverage this: "My background in NLP evaluation, retrieval system optimization, and generative model fine-tuning positions me to improve Charlotte AI's accuracy and relevance for SOC analysts."

#### Global Lever 3: Cloud-Native Security & CNAPP

Cloud security generates unique data science challenges. Negotiate accordingly: "My expertise in cloud workload behavioral modeling and anomaly detection supports CrowdStrike's CNAPP strategy with data-driven threat detection for containerized and serverless environments."

#### Global Lever 4: Threat Intelligence & Identity Protection

Threat intelligence is inherently a data science problem. Negotiate with domain expertise: "My experience in adversary behavior modeling and identity analytics directly strengthens CrowdStrike's threat intelligence capabilities and the Agentic SOC's autonomous decision-making."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $220,000 base with 1,400 RSUs ($490,000 at CRWD ~$350). Accept-at floor: $360,000 total comp. Cite the January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch, $245M Q3 income, and your role as an Orchestrator of the Agentic SOC.
