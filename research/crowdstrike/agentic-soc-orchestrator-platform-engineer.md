| Staff+ (L6+) | $295,000–$385,000 | $320,000–$420,000 | £150,000–£198,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus. CrowdStrike RSUs vest quarterly after a 1-year cliff. This role commands the highest premiums in CrowdStrike's engineering organization — 15-20% above general SWE at equivalent levels — reflecting the strategic centrality of the Agentic SOC to CrowdStrike's future. RSU grants of 2,000-4,000 shares ($700,000-$1,400,000 at CRWD ~$350+) are standard at L5+ for this role.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at CrowdStrike

The Agentic SOC Orchestrator Platform Engineer is the most strategically important engineering role at CrowdStrike in 2026. On January 28, CrowdStrike launched the Agentic Security Platform — a paradigm shift from human-managed security operations to autonomous AI-agent-managed SOCs. This role is ground zero for that transformation. You design and build the Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC: the autonomous AI agents that detect threats, investigate incidents, triage alerts, and execute response actions across millions of endpoints — all without human intervention.

CrowdStrike's $245M Q3 net income proves the company has the financial strength to make this the highest-priority, best-funded engineering initiative in the organization. The Agentic SOC is not a side project or an R&D experiment — it is the declared strategic direction of a $90B+ company, backed by record profitability. Every dollar of investment in the Agentic Security Platform is justified by the company's commercial performance, and the engineers who build it are compensated accordingly.

This role commands the highest engineering premiums at CrowdStrike because it sits at the intersection of three scarce skill sets: distributed systems architecture (building agent orchestration at Falcon-scale), ML/AI engineering (designing autonomous agent reasoning and decision-making), and cybersecurity domain expertise (understanding adversary behavior, detection logic, and SOC workflows). The talent pool at this intersection is extraordinarily narrow, and CrowdStrike is competing against Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Palo Alto Networks, and every major AI-security startup for it.

#### CrowdStrike Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Agentic SOC Platform Engineer | 3–6 years |
| L5 | Senior Agentic SOC Platform Engineer | 6–10 years |
| L6 | Staff Agentic SOC Orchestrator Engineer | 10–15 years |
| L7 | Principal Agentic SOC Architect | 15+ years |
| L8 | Distinguished Engineer, Agentic SOC | 18+ years |

*This is a new role category at CrowdStrike, created in direct response to the January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch. Leveling norms are still forming, which creates an opportunity for candidates to negotiate higher levels by demonstrating directly relevant experience in autonomous systems, multi-agent architectures, or AI agent orchestration. Push for L5+ if you have 6+ years of relevant experience — the RSU difference between L4 and L5 can exceed $150,000 annually.*

### 🤖 CrowdStrike Agentic Security Platform & SOC Orchestrator Lever

CrowdStrike's January 28 Agentic Security Platform announcement is the single most important strategic initiative in the company's history. It introduced the Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC — a new class of autonomous AI agents that manage security operations at machine speed. Detection Orchestrators identify threats in real time. Investigation Orchestrators gather evidence and context. Triage Orchestrators assess severity and urgency. Response Orchestrators execute containment and remediation. Together, they form a fleet of specialized AI agents that operate the SOC autonomously, with human analysts providing oversight and handling exceptions.

As an Agentic SOC Orchestrator Platform Engineer, you build every layer of this system: the agent lifecycle management (spawning, monitoring, retiring Orchestrators), the inter-agent communication protocols (how detection agents hand off to investigation agents), the resource governance layer (CPU, memory, and API rate limits across hundreds of concurrent Orchestrators), the fault isolation mechanisms (preventing one misbehaving agent from cascading failures), and the trust architecture (programmatic guardrails, audit trails, approval workflows, and rollback mechanisms that ensure autonomous agents operate safely).

The $245M Q3 income is not just a financial metric — it is proof that CrowdStrike can fund this transformation at the scale required. Charlotte AI, the generative security assistant, is a critical component of the Agentic SOC stack: Orchestrators invoke Charlotte AI for natural-language threat analysis, and Charlotte AI serves as the human-facing interface for Orchestrator activity. The platform engineering work required to integrate Charlotte AI with the Orchestrator fleet is a defining technical challenge.

When negotiating, use this language with full confidence: "CrowdStrike's January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch and $245M Q3 income prove the company is investing massively in autonomous security. I negotiate as an Orchestrator of the Agentic SOC who manages AI agent fleets at scale. This role sits at the intersection of distributed systems, AI agent architecture, and cybersecurity — the narrowest and most valuable talent intersection in the industry. My compensation should reflect the strategic centrality of the Agentic SOC to CrowdStrike's future and the scarcity of engineers who can build it."

#### Global Lever 1: Falcon Platform & Endpoint Dominance

The Falcon platform processes over five trillion security events per week across millions of endpoints globally. As an Agentic SOC Orchestrator Platform Engineer, you are not just working within this scale — you are extending it by adding an entirely new computational layer: the Orchestrator fleet. Every Orchestrator consumes Falcon telemetry, invokes Falcon platform actions, and generates its own operational data. The aggregate compute, memory, and data footprint of the Orchestrator fleet at Falcon-scale is a platform engineering challenge comparable to the largest workloads at any hyperscaler.

Negotiate by citing this unique scale challenge: "The Falcon platform operates at hyperscaler scale, and the Orchestrator fleet I build adds an entirely new computational layer on top of it. Designing agent infrastructure that operates reliably at this scale — trillions of events, millions of endpoints, hundreds of concurrent Orchestrators — is a platform engineering challenge that fewer than 50 engineers in the world can solve. My compensation should reflect this scarcity."

#### Global Lever 2: Charlotte AI & Generative Security

Charlotte AI is deeply integrated with the Agentic SOC Orchestrator architecture. Orchestrators invoke Charlotte AI for contextual threat analysis, and Charlotte AI surfaces Orchestrator activity and decisions to human analysts. As the Orchestrator Platform Engineer, you design the integration layer between the Orchestrator fleet and Charlotte AI — including prompt engineering for agent-to-Charlotte communication, response parsing for Orchestrator decision inputs, and the UX pipeline that presents Orchestrator reasoning to human operators.

Negotiate with AI integration depth: "The Charlotte AI integration is one of the most technically demanding aspects of the Orchestrator platform. I design how autonomous agents communicate with a generative AI system and how that system communicates back to human operators. This human-AI-agent interface is novel, technically complex, and directly impacts the Agentic SOC's usability and trustworthiness."

#### Global Lever 3: Cloud-Native Security & CNAPP

The Agentic SOC Orchestrator platform is built cloud-native from the ground up — Kubernetes-orchestrated, event-driven, globally distributed, and designed for zero-downtime deployment. As the platform engineer, you define the infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD pipelines, deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, progressive rollout), and observability stack for the Orchestrator fleet. This is cloud-native platform engineering at its most advanced, applied to the most demanding workload in cybersecurity.

Negotiate with architectural authority: "The Orchestrator platform is a greenfield cloud-native system built at hyperscaler scale. I define the architectural patterns, deployment strategies, and observability standards for this platform. This level of architectural authority for a strategically critical system is exceptionally rare and exceptionally valuable."

#### Global Lever 4: Threat Intelligence & Identity Protection

The Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC consume CrowdStrike's threat intelligence — 230+ adversary groups tracked with detailed TTPs — to make autonomous security decisions. As the Orchestrator Platform Engineer, you design how threat intelligence data flows to Orchestrators, how Orchestrators correlate telemetry with adversary profiles, and how identity protection signals integrate into the agent decision pipeline. This requires understanding both the platform engineering challenges and the security domain context.

Negotiate with domain integration: "The Orchestrator platform integrates CrowdStrike's threat intelligence and identity protection signals directly into autonomous agent decisions. I design how 230+ adversary profiles and identity risk scores flow into real-time Orchestrator reasoning. This combination of platform engineering and security domain integration is unique to this role and justifies premium compensation."

#### Agentic SOC Orchestrator — Deep Dive: Agent Lifecycle & Multi-Agent Coordination

This role involves designing the full agent lifecycle for the Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC:

1. **Agent Spawning**: Designing how Orchestrators are instantiated based on threat conditions, customer policies, and resource availability. Each Orchestrator is a specialized agent (detection, investigation, triage, response) with its own model, context window, and action space.

2. **Inter-Agent Communication**: Building the message-passing and coordination layer that allows Orchestrators to hand off context between stages — detection to investigation, investigation to triage, triage to response — without data loss, latency spikes, or conflicting actions.

3. **Resource Governance**: Implementing scheduling, quota management, and priority systems that prevent Orchestrator resource contention from degrading Falcon platform performance. Hundreds of concurrent Orchestrators across millions of customer endpoints require sophisticated multi-tenant resource management.

4. **Fault Isolation**: Ensuring that one misbehaving Orchestrator cannot cascade failures to the fleet. This requires circuit breakers, bulkheads, and timeout mechanisms designed specifically for autonomous AI agents — a new category of fault isolation.

5. **Trust Architecture**: Designing the programmatic guardrails, audit trails, approval workflows, and rollback mechanisms that ensure Orchestrators operate within customer-defined safety boundaries. When an Orchestrator decides to isolate an endpoint, the platform must enforce authorization, log the decision chain, and provide one-click rollback.

This lifecycle management work is the heart of the Agentic Security Platform and the most technically demanding platform engineering at CrowdStrike.
