### Engineering Manager — CrowdStrike Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering Managers at CrowdStrike lead the teams building the Agentic Security Platform and drive execution for the Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC initiative across the Falcon engineering organization.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Austin (USD) | Sunnyvale (USD) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $170,000–$210,000 | $185,000–$230,000 | £85,000–£110,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $215,000–$280,000 | $235,000–$310,000 | £110,000–£145,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $280,000–$360,000 | $305,000–$400,000 | £145,000–£185,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus (15-20% target). CrowdStrike RSUs vest quarterly after a 1-year cliff. Engineering managers at L5+ should expect RSU grants of 1,500-3,500 shares ($525,000-$1,225,000 at CRWD ~$350+).*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at CrowdStrike

Engineering Managers at CrowdStrike are responsible for building and scaling the teams that deliver the Agentic Security Platform. Since the January 28 announcement, the demand for engineering leadership has intensified as the company builds out the Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC — a new category of autonomous security agents that require dedicated teams of engineers, data scientists, and security researchers.

CrowdStrike's $245M Q3 net income enables aggressive team scaling, and Engineering Managers are the force multipliers who ensure that hiring translates into delivered product. They balance technical depth with people leadership, making critical decisions about team structure, hiring priorities, and execution strategy for the Agentic SOC roadmap.

The scarcity of Engineering Managers with cybersecurity domain expertise creates significant negotiation leverage. CrowdStrike's RSU packages at the management level are designed to compete with Big Tech, and candidates should negotiate knowing that their ability to build and retain high-performing teams directly impacts the company's Agentic Security Platform delivery timeline.

#### CrowdStrike Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical Reports |
|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| M1 (L5) | Engineering Manager | 6–10 direct reports |
| M2 (L6) | Senior Engineering Manager | 10–15 reports, 2–3 teams |
| M3 (L7) | Director of Engineering | 3–5 teams, 20–40 engineers |
| M4 (L8) | VP Engineering | Multiple orgs |

*If you are managing multiple teams (10+ reports), push for M2/L6 leveling — the equity gap between M1 and M2 is substantial.*

### 🤖 CrowdStrike Agentic Security Platform & SOC Orchestrator Lever

CrowdStrike's January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch created new organizational demands. Engineering Managers are now building teams that develop Orchestrators of the Agentic SOC — AI agents that autonomously handle security operations. This requires managers who can recruit AI/ML engineers, security researchers, and distributed systems engineers, then align them around a shared product vision.

The $245M Q3 income gives Engineering Managers the budget to build world-class teams. CrowdStrike's financial strength means headcount is available — the bottleneck is leadership that can attract top talent and deliver complex cross-functional products like Charlotte AI and the Agentic SOC orchestration layer.

Use this negotiation framing: "CrowdStrike's January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch and $245M Q3 income prove the company is investing massively in autonomous security. I negotiate as an Orchestrator of the Agentic SOC who manages AI agent fleets at scale."

Engineering Managers should highlight their experience building and scaling engineering teams in high-growth environments, shipping complex distributed systems products, and navigating the intersection of AI/ML and security — all critical for the Agentic Security Platform's success.

#### Global Lever 1: Falcon Platform & Endpoint Dominance

Managing teams that build and scale the Falcon platform is a core responsibility. Negotiate by citing team-level outcomes: "I've built and scaled engineering teams from [X] to [Y] engineers while maintaining velocity on mission-critical systems. This execution capability is exactly what CrowdStrike needs for its Falcon platform expansion."

#### Global Lever 2: Charlotte AI & Generative Security

Charlotte AI requires dedicated engineering teams with specialized AI/ML expertise. Negotiate accordingly: "My experience building and leading AI platform teams positions me to recruit and retain the specialized talent needed to advance Charlotte AI within the Agentic SOC architecture."

#### Global Lever 3: Cloud-Native Security & CNAPP

CrowdStrike's CNAPP teams need strong engineering leadership. Leverage your cloud experience: "I've led cloud-native engineering teams that shipped container security and workload protection products, directly relevant to CrowdStrike's CNAPP growth strategy."

#### Global Lever 4: Threat Intelligence & Identity Protection

Cross-functional alignment across threat intelligence and identity teams is critical. Negotiate with organizational savvy: "My ability to align multiple engineering teams around shared threat intelligence goals supports CrowdStrike's platform consolidation strategy and the Agentic SOC's data integration needs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $260,000 base with 2,000 RSUs ($700,000 at CRWD ~$350). Accept-at floor: $430,000 total comp. Cite the January 28 Agentic Security Platform launch, $245M Q3 income, and your role as an Orchestrator of the Agentic SOC.
