**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Take-Two build the pipelines and infrastructure that process player telemetry from GTA Online (tens of millions of active players), NBA 2K (Virtual Currency economy analytics), Red Dead Online, and other live-service titles. GTA Online's data infrastructure is critical — it powers monetization optimization, content scheduling, anti-cheat detection, and game economy balancing for one of the longest-running and most profitable live-service games in history. NBA 2K's VC economy generates massive transactional data that requires real-time processing for fraud detection and economy balancing. Take-Two's data platform spans multiple studios (Rockstar, 2K, Private Division) with different data architectures and requirements. The NYC headquarters hosts the central data platform team.
