### Engineering Manager | Take-Two Interactive Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Premium Bonus | GTA + NBA 2K Revenue Machine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $200K–$260K | $120K–$280K | 20–25% | $290K–$440K |
| San Diego (Rockstar) | $185K–$248K | $110K–$260K | 20–25% | $275K–$420K |
| Bangalore | ₹35L–₹58L | ₹18L–₹40L | 15–20% | ₹58L–₹105L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Take-Two (Rockstar, 2K) lead teams building the most technically ambitious and commercially successful games in history. At Rockstar, EMs manage teams under intense secrecy and quality expectations — Rockstar's culture demands perfection, and EMs are responsible for maintaining both delivery velocity and the legendary quality bar. The GTA VI development cycle is the most significant engineering program in entertainment, and EMs on this project manage teams whose work will be seen by hundreds of millions of players. At 2K, EMs manage teams on NBA 2K (the dominant basketball game), Civilization, and other franchises. Take-Two's premium bonus structure (20-25%) at the EM level creates substantial variable comp upside. [Source: Take-Two EM Framework, Rockstar Culture 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Take-Two EM = Google L5-L6 Manager = Meta M1-M2 = EA EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Rockstar Quality Bar:** "Managing a team at Rockstar's quality standard is uniquely demanding. The expectation is perfection — every system must be polished to a degree unmatched in the industry. This quality pressure justifies premium EM comp."
2. **GTA VI Delivery Pressure:** "GTA VI is the most anticipated game in history. EMs on this project carry enormous delivery responsibility — the stakes are measured in billions of dollars."
3. **Retention During Crunch:** "Rockstar's development cycles are intense. As EM, I'm responsible for maintaining team health and retention during high-pressure periods. This management challenge is harder than typical tech EM roles."
4. **Premium Bonus Leverage:** "I want the bonus at 25% with visibility into the multiplier. For a franchise generating billions, the EM's bonus should reflect the revenue leverage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $400K TC — $250K base, $250K RSU/4yr, and 25% bonus. Managing at Rockstar/Take-Two during GTA VI development is a once-in-a-career opportunity with extraordinary delivery pressure and impact." Accept at $220K+ RSUs with 25% bonus.
