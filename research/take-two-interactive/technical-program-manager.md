### Technical Program Manager | Take-Two Interactive Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Premium Bonus | GTA + NBA 2K Revenue Machine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $148K–$208K | $48K–$155K | 15–20% | $188K–$295K |
| San Diego (Rockstar) | $138K–$198K | $42K–$142K | 15–20% | $175K–$280K |
| Bangalore | ₹22L–₹38L | ₹10L–₹22L | 10–15% | ₹35L–₹65L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Take-Two coordinate the delivery of the most technically ambitious and commercially valuable games in entertainment history. At Rockstar, TPMs manage programs for GTA and Red Dead — multi-year, multi-studio development efforts with budgets exceeding $500M. These are among the most complex software programs in any industry, coordinating across engineering, art, design, QA, audio, motion capture, marketing, and platform certification. GTA VI's development involves thousands of people across multiple Rockstar studios (NYC, San Diego, Edinburgh, Lincoln, India) — the program management challenge is staggering. At 2K, TPMs manage the annual NBA 2K cycle and online service operations. Take-Two's premium bonus structure provides meaningful variable comp.

**Level Mapping:** Take-Two TPM = Google L4-L5 TPM = Amazon L6 TPM = EA TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **$500M+ Program Scale:** "GTA development programs have budgets exceeding $500M. Managing programs at this scale — coordinating thousands of people across multiple studios and countries — is among the most complex program management work in any industry."
2. **Multi-Studio Global Coordination:** "Rockstar operates across NYC, San Diego, Edinburgh, Lincoln, and India. TPMs must coordinate across studios, time zones, and cultures while maintaining a unified development vision."
3. **Platform Certification Deadlines:** "Console certification (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo) creates immovable deadlines. Missing certification windows can delay launches and cost tens of millions in revenue."
4. **Premium Bonus for Delivery Impact:** "Successfully shipping GTA or Red Dead launches is a once-in-a-decade event worth billions. TPMs who deliver these programs deserve premium comp — 20% bonus target."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $275K TC — $198K base, $138K RSU/4yr, and 20% bonus. Managing programs at Rockstar's scale — $500M+ budgets, thousands of contributors, multi-studio global coordination — is among the most demanding TPM work in any industry." Accept at $105K+ RSUs with 20% bonus.
