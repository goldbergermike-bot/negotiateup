### ML/AI Engineer | Take-Two Interactive Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Premium Bonus | GTA + NBA 2K Revenue Machine | **+10–20% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $160K–$228K | $70K–$200K | 15–20% | $218K–$340K |
| San Diego (Rockstar) | $150K–$215K | $65K–$185K | 15–20% | $205K–$320K |
| Bangalore | ₹26L–₹45L | ₹14L–₹32L | 15% | ₹44L–₹84L |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Take-Two work on some of the most ambitious AI challenges in gaming: GTA's NPC behavior AI (simulating thousands of autonomous characters with realistic behaviors), procedural content generation, advanced physics simulation, anti-cheat ML, and generative AI for game development acceleration. Rockstar's RAGE engine includes proprietary NPC AI that sets the industry standard for open-world character behavior. The upcoming GTA VI is expected to feature the most advanced NPC AI ever seen in a game. At 2K, ML engineers work on NBA 2K's player simulation AI and prediction models. Take-Two has invested heavily in AI/ML since 2024, creating new roles in generative AI for game development tools, procedural world generation, and intelligent testing automation.
