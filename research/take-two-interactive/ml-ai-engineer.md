**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Take-Two work on some of the most ambitious AI challenges in gaming: GTA's NPC behavior AI (simulating thousands of autonomous characters with realistic behaviors), procedural content generation, advanced physics simulation, anti-cheat ML, and generative AI for game development acceleration. Rockstar's RAGE engine includes proprietary NPC AI that sets the industry standard for open-world character behavior. The upcoming GTA VI is expected to feature the most advanced NPC AI ever seen in a game. At 2K, ML engineers work on NBA 2K's player simulation AI and prediction models. Take-Two has invested heavily in AI/ML since 2024, creating new roles in generative AI for game development tools, procedural world generation, and intelligent testing automation.
