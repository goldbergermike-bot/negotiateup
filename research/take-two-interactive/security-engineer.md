**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Take-Two protect some of the most targeted properties in gaming. GTA Online's virtual economy and Rockstar's IP are high-value targets for hackers, cheat developers, and organized fraud rings. The GTA source code leak in 2022 demonstrated the severity of security risks at Rockstar — making security a top organizational priority. Security at Take-Two spans application security, network security (protecting game servers from DDoS), anti-cheat engineering, virtual economy fraud prevention, source code and IP protection, and incident response. Rockstar's secretive development culture makes security particularly critical — early game leaks can damage marketing plans and franchise value. The security function has been significantly strengthened since the 2022 breach. [Source: Take-Two Security, Rockstar Post-Breach Investments 2025]
