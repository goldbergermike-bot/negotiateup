**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Take-Two protect some of the most targeted properties in gaming. GTA Online's virtual economy and Rockstar's IP are high-value targets for hackers, cheat developers, and organized fraud rings. The GTA source code leak in 2022 demonstrated the severity of security risks at Rockstar — making security a top organizational priority. Security at Take-Two spans application security, network security (protecting game servers from DDoS), anti-cheat engineering, virtual economy fraud prevention, source code and IP protection, and incident response. Rockstar's secretive development culture makes security particularly critical — early game leaks can damage marketing plans and franchise value. The security function has been significantly strengthened since the 2022 breach. [Source: Take-Two Security, Rockstar Post-Breach Investments 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Take-Two Security Engineer = Google L4 Security = EA Security Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **Post-Breach Security Investment:** "The 2022 GTA leak elevated security to a top priority at Rockstar/Take-Two. Security engineers joining now are part of a strengthened security organization with significant investment and executive support."
2. **IP Protection Criticality:** "GTA VI is the most valuable unreleased IP in entertainment. Protecting this IP from leaks and unauthorized access is a matter of billions in franchise value."
3. **Virtual Economy Security:** "GTA Online's virtual economy processes hundreds of millions in microtransactions. Protecting this economy from fraud, item duplication, and currency exploitation directly preserves revenue."
4. **Premium Bonus for Security:** "Post-breach, security's value is well-understood at Take-Two. I want the bonus at 20% reflecting security's elevated organizational priority."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $280K TC — $200K base, $148K RSU/4yr, and 20% bonus. Post-breach security at Take-Two is a top organizational priority, and my expertise in [application security/incident response/game security] directly addresses the company's most critical security needs." Accept at $115K+ RSUs with 20% bonus.
