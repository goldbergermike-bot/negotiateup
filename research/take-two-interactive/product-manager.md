### Product Manager | Take-Two Interactive Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Premium Bonus | GTA + NBA 2K Revenue Machine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $150K–$215K | $60K–$180K | 15–20% | $205K–$320K |
| San Diego (Rockstar) | $140K–$200K | $55K–$165K | 15–20% | $192K–$298K |
| Bangalore | ₹25L–₹42L | ₹12L–₹28L | 15% | ₹42L–₹76L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Take-Two own product strategy for the most iconic gaming franchises — GTA Online's ongoing content and monetization strategy, NBA 2K's Virtual Currency economy, Red Dead Online's live-service operations, and new franchise development. PMs at Rockstar operate differently from typical tech PMs — Rockstar's creative-led culture means the PM function is more closely integrated with game design and creative direction. PMs on GTA Online manage one of the most profitable live-service products in gaming history, with direct responsibility for content cadence, player engagement, and monetization that generates hundreds of millions annually. PMs at 2K manage the NBA 2K franchise's VC economy and MyTeam monetization — a major revenue driver. Take-Two's premium bonus structure gives PMs meaningful variable comp.

**Level Mapping:** Take-Two PM = Google L5 PM = EA PM = Activision PM

**Global Levers**

1. **GTA Online Revenue Attribution:** If on GTA Online: "GTA Online generates hundreds of millions annually from ongoing content. As PM, my content strategy and monetization decisions directly drive this revenue — few PM roles have such clear P&L ownership."
2. **NBA 2K VC Economy:** If on NBA 2K: "NBA 2K's Virtual Currency economy is a major revenue driver for 2K. PM decisions on VC pricing, spending opportunities, and player progression directly impact franchise profitability."
3. **Premium Bonus for Revenue PMs:** "PMs with direct revenue attribution should have premium bonus targets. I'm targeting 20% with multiplier upside tied to franchise revenue performance."
4. **GTA VI Stock Catalyst:** "RSUs granted before GTA VI launch have significant appreciation potential. I want the RSU grant sized to capture this once-in-a-generation catalyst."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $295K TC — $205K base, $160K RSU/4yr, and 20% bonus. My live-service PM experience maps directly to GTA Online/NBA 2K's monetization strategy, with competing offers from [Riot/EA] at [X]." Accept at $130K+ RSUs with 20% bonus.
