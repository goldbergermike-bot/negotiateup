**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Take-Two leverage player behavior data from some of the richest game worlds ever created. GTA Online's open-world environment generates uniquely complex behavioral data — player movement, social interaction, economic transactions, criminal behavior simulation, and emergent gameplay. DS roles at Take-Two span GTA Online economy modeling (balancing the in-game economy to optimize player spending and satisfaction), NBA 2K player progression analytics, matchmaking optimization, churn prediction, and content recommendation. The DS function at Take-Two has grown as the company has increased its focus on data-driven live-service optimization. DS professionals with game economy modeling experience are particularly valued — GTA Online's virtual economy is one of the most complex in gaming.
