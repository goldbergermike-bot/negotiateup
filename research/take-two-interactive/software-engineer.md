**Negotiation DNA**

Take-Two Interactive ($30B market cap, NYC) owns some of the most valuable entertainment franchises in history — Grand Theft Auto ($8B+ lifetime GTA V revenue), NBA 2K, Red Dead Redemption, and BioShock — through its Rockstar Games, 2K Games, and Private Division labels. Take-Two's comp model includes base + RSUs + premium bonus (15-20%), with the bonus structure being notably generous compared to other gaming companies. Take-Two's stock has strong growth potential with GTA VI on the horizon — the most anticipated game in history is expected to drive significant stock appreciation. Engineers at Take-Two work across studios: Rockstar (NYC, San Diego, Edinburgh, Lincoln) for GTA and Red Dead; 2K (Novato, Baltimore) for NBA 2K and Civilization. The NYC headquarters offers access to Take-Two's corporate engineering teams. [Source: Take-Two FY2026 Investor Report]

**Level Mapping:** Take-Two SWE = Google L3 = Meta E3 = EA ICT2

**Global Levers**

1. **GTA VI Stock Catalyst:** "GTA VI is the biggest entertainment launch in history. Take-Two's stock price is expected to appreciate significantly around launch. RSUs granted now capture this upside — I want a generous RSU grant."
2. **Premium Bonus Structure:** "Take-Two's 15-20% bonus is above gaming industry average. Push for 20%: 'Given the franchise revenue my work supports, I'd like the bonus target at 20% with strong multiplier potential.'"
3. **Multi-Studio Opportunity:** "Take-Two operates through multiple studios. I want clarity on which studio and franchise I'll be working on, as comp and culture vary significantly between Rockstar and 2K."
4. **NYC Cost of Living:** If NYC-based: "NYC comp should reflect the cost of living. Take-Two's NYC office competes with FAANG NYC offices for talent — my base should be benchmarked against NYC tech market rates."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "I'm targeting $240K TC — $175K base, $110K RSU/4yr, and 20% bonus. GTA VI's impending launch creates a once-in-a-generation stock appreciation opportunity, and I want the RSU grant to capture this upside." Take-Two will counter at $70K–$90K RSUs. Push to $95K+ with 20% bonus. Accept if TC exceeds $220K.
