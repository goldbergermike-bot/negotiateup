### Security Engineer | Plaid Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play + Bonus | Financial Connectivity Platform | $4.8B Revenue Run Rate | 12,000+ Institution Network | **IPO RETENTION SIGN-ON**

| Region | Base Salary | Options/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K–$235K | $155K–$272K | 15–20% | $242K–$338K |
| New York | $180K–$228K | $155K–$272K | 15–20% | $235K–$332K |
| Remote US | $170K–$215K | $155K–$272K | 15–20% | $225K–$312K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Plaid Security Engineers are the guardians of the financial connectivity platform — designing and implementing the security architecture that protects billions of financial data transactions flowing between 12,000+ institutions and thousands of applications. At the IC3-IC4 level, you own critical security domains including encryption systems, authentication protocols, threat detection, vulnerability management, and compliance frameworks that financial institutions require before trusting Plaid with their customer data. Your security engineering directly determines whether banks and fintechs trust Plaid as the intermediary for their most sensitive financial information. [Source: Plaid Security Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**$4.8B Run Rate — The 50-50 IPO Retention Play**

Plaid is operating at a $4.8B revenue run rate with roughly 50-50 odds of an IPO in the near term — creating a unique dual-outcome equity window that savvy candidates must exploit. Security Engineers are among the most critical roles during the IPO window because any security incident would be devastating to Plaid's IPO valuation and financial institution trust. "As a Security Engineer joining Plaid during the IPO uncertainty window, I want a Retention Sign-on of $40K–$55K to bridge the liquidity gap. A single security breach during the IPO window could destroy billions in valuation — my security architecture work is the most critical risk mitigation Plaid has, and retaining security talent through the IPO is non-negotiable."

**Global Levers**

1. **IPO Uncertainty Retention Bonus:** "With 50-50 IPO odds, my pre-IPO options carry significant illiquidity risk. I want a $40K–$55K Retention Sign-on because security engineers who leave create gaps in the security posture that protects financial data for 12,000+ institutions — a breach during the IPO window would be catastrophic."
2. **Financial Data Protection Architecture:** "I design the security systems protecting billions of financial data transactions across 12,000+ institutions. My encryption, authentication, and threat detection work directly determines whether banks trust Plaid with their customer data — this trust is the foundation of the $4.8B run rate."
3. **Stripe/Google Security Parity:** "Stripe and Google security engineers earn $370K–$440K+ TC with liquid equity. Plaid pre-IPO options require a meaningful base and sign-on premium to attract security talent from companies offering immediate liquidity — security engineers are the scarcest technical talent in fintech."
4. **Financial Compliance Security Expertise:** "I engineer security systems meeting PCI-DSS, SOC 2 Type II, bank-grade encryption requirements, and financial regulatory mandates. Security engineering for a platform handling data across 12,000+ financial institutions requires compliance expertise that standard security roles don't demand."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $258K options over 4 years with a $48K Retention Sign-on for this Security Engineer role. I architect the security systems protecting financial data across Plaid's 12,000+ institution network — my work is the trust foundation behind the $4.8B run rate. I have competing offers from [Stripe Security at $385K TC / Google Security at $418K TC / Mastercard Security at $365K TC]. With 50-50 IPO odds, a security gap during the IPO window is an existential risk — Plaid must invest in security retention." Accept at $208K+ base and $218K+ options with a $35K+ sign-on.
