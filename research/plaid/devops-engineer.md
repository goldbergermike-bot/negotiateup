### DevOps Engineer | Plaid Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play + Bonus | Financial Connectivity Platform | $4.8B Revenue Run Rate | 12,000+ Institution Network | **IPO RETENTION SIGN-ON**

| Region | Base Salary | Options/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $155K–$198K | $112K–$198K | 10–15% | $192K–$268K |
| New York | $150K–$192K | $112K–$198K | 10–15% | $188K–$262K |
| Remote US | $142K–$182K | $112K–$198K | 10–15% | $178K–$248K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Plaid DevOps Engineers are the infrastructure operators ensuring the financial connectivity platform runs with bank-grade reliability — building and maintaining the CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, monitoring systems, and deployment automation that keep Plaid's APIs available across 12,000+ financial institution integrations. At the IC2-IC3 level, you own the operational infrastructure that guarantees platform uptime, deployment velocity, and incident response for a system processing billions of financial data requests. Your infrastructure decisions directly determine whether Plaid meets the SLA commitments that financial institutions and fintechs depend on. [Source: Plaid DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**$4.8B Run Rate — The 50-50 IPO Retention Play**

Plaid is operating at a $4.8B revenue run rate with roughly 50-50 odds of an IPO in the near term — creating a unique dual-outcome equity window that savvy candidates must exploit. DevOps Engineers are critical during the IPO window because platform uptime and infrastructure reliability are core metrics that investors and financial institution partners scrutinize. "As a DevOps Engineer joining Plaid during the IPO uncertainty window, I want a Retention Sign-on of $25K–$35K to bridge the liquidity gap. My infrastructure work ensures the platform reliability that financial institutions require — any downtime during the IPO window directly damages Plaid's credibility with both investors and partners."

**Global Levers**

1. **IPO Uncertainty Retention Bonus:** "With 50-50 IPO odds, my pre-IPO options carry illiquidity risk. I want a $25K–$35K Retention Sign-on because DevOps engineers who leave during the IPO window create infrastructure knowledge gaps that lead to outages — and outages during an IPO process are catastrophic for valuation."
2. **Bank-Grade Infrastructure Operations:** "I maintain the infrastructure supporting 12,000+ financial institution integrations with bank-grade uptime requirements. My CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and incident response directly determine whether Plaid meets the SLA commitments driving the $4.8B run rate."
3. **Stripe/Google Infra SWE Parity:** "Stripe infrastructure engineers and Google SREs earn $275K–$340K+ TC with liquid equity. Plaid pre-IPO options require a base and sign-on premium to compete for infrastructure talent against companies offering immediate liquidity."
4. **Financial Compliance Infrastructure:** "I build infrastructure that meets PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and bank-grade security requirements — not just standard SaaS uptime. Compliance-aware infrastructure engineering for financial data platforms is a specialized skill that commands premium comp over standard DevOps roles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $190K base and $188K options over 4 years with a $30K Retention Sign-on for this DevOps Engineer role. I operate the infrastructure ensuring bank-grade reliability across Plaid's 12,000+ institution integrations — my work directly supports the platform uptime driving the $4.8B run rate. I have competing offers from [Stripe Infra SWE at $285K TC / Google SRE at $312K TC / Square DevOps at $272K TC]. With 50-50 IPO odds, Plaid cannot afford infrastructure knowledge gaps during the IPO window." Accept at $175K+ base and $158K+ options with a $22K+ sign-on.
