### Data Scientist | Plaid Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play + Bonus | Financial Connectivity Platform | $4.8B Revenue Run Rate | 12,000+ Institution Network | **IPO RETENTION SIGN-ON**

| Region | Base Salary | Options/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $175K–$222K | $142K–$252K | 15–20% | $228K–$318K |
| New York | $170K–$215K | $142K–$252K | 15–20% | $222K–$312K |
| Remote US | $160K–$202K | $142K–$252K | 15–20% | $212K–$295K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Plaid Data Scientists are the analytical leaders extracting insights from one of the richest financial datasets in the world — modeling transaction patterns across 12,000+ financial institutions, building the fraud detection and risk scoring models that protect the platform, and generating the product intelligence that drives Plaid's strategic decisions. At the IC3-IC4 level, you own critical analytical domains where data-driven decisions directly impact platform reliability, fraud prevention, and revenue optimization. Your models and analyses shape how Plaid understands and serves the financial ecosystem powering the $4.8B run rate. [Source: Plaid DS Comp 2025-2026]

**$4.8B Run Rate — The 50-50 IPO Retention Play**

Plaid is operating at a $4.8B revenue run rate with roughly 50-50 odds of an IPO in the near term — creating a unique dual-outcome equity window that savvy candidates must exploit. Data Scientists are critical during the IPO window because the analytical infrastructure — fraud models, transaction categorization, risk scoring — represents years of institutional knowledge that cannot be quickly rebuilt. "As a Data Scientist joining Plaid during the IPO uncertainty window, I want a Retention Sign-on of $35K–$50K to bridge the liquidity gap. My models protect Plaid's platform from fraud and power the data products driving revenue — losing data science talent during the IPO window means losing the analytical foundations investors evaluate."

**Global Levers**

1. **IPO Uncertainty Retention Bonus:** "With 50-50 IPO odds, my pre-IPO options carry significant illiquidity risk. I want a $35K–$50K Retention Sign-on because data scientists who leave take model knowledge and analytical frameworks that took years to build — Plaid cannot afford to rebuild its analytical infrastructure during the IPO window."
2. **Financial Data Intelligence:** "I model transaction patterns across 12,000+ financial institutions — one of the richest financial datasets in the world. My fraud detection and risk scoring models directly protect Plaid's platform integrity and enable the data products driving revenue growth."
3. **Stripe/Google DS Parity:** "Stripe and Google data scientists earn $350K–$420K+ TC with liquid equity. Plaid pre-IPO options require a base and sign-on premium to attract data science talent from companies offering immediate liquidity and established data organizations."
4. **Fintech-Specific Analytical Expertise:** "I build models on regulated financial data with unique compliance constraints — FCRA, fair lending, privacy regulations. Financial data science requires domain expertise that standard tech DS roles don't demand, and this specialization commands premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $212K base and $238K options over 4 years with a $42K Retention Sign-on for this Data Scientist role. I build the fraud detection and risk models protecting Plaid's platform across 12,000+ institutions — my analytical work directly safeguards the $4.8B run rate. I have competing offers from [Stripe DS at $365K TC / Google DS at $398K TC / Square DS at $348K TC]. With 50-50 IPO odds, Plaid needs analytical continuity through the IPO window." Accept at $195K+ base and $198K+ options with a $30K+ sign-on.
