### ML/AI Engineer | Plaid Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play + Bonus | Financial Connectivity Platform | $4.8B Revenue Run Rate | 12,000+ Institution Network | **+15-25% AI PREMIUM** | **IPO RETENTION SIGN-ON**

| Region | Base Salary | Options/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $198K–$252K | $192K–$338K | 15–20% | $275K–$388K |
| New York | $192K–$245K | $192K–$338K | 15–20% | $268K–$378K |
| Remote US | $182K–$232K | $192K–$338K | 15–20% | $255K–$358K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Plaid ML/AI Engineers are the intelligence architects building the machine learning systems that power the financial connectivity platform's most valuable capabilities — transaction categorization, fraud detection, identity verification, income estimation, and predictive financial analytics across 12,000+ institutions. At the IC3-IC4 level with a 15-25% AI Premium, you design and deploy the models that transform raw financial data into intelligent products. Your ML systems determine the accuracy and reliability of every AI-powered financial insight Plaid delivers, directly driving product differentiation and the premium pricing that fuels the $4.8B run rate.

**$4.8B Run Rate — The 50-50 IPO Retention Play**

Plaid is operating at a $4.8B revenue run rate with roughly 50-50 odds of an IPO in the near term — creating a unique dual-outcome equity window that savvy candidates must exploit. ML/AI Engineers command a 15-25% AI Premium because they build the intelligent products that differentiate Plaid from competitors like MX, Yodlee, and Finicity — and AI talent is the scarcest resource in fintech. "As an ML/AI Engineer joining Plaid during the IPO uncertainty window, I want a Retention Sign-on of $45K–$65K to bridge the liquidity gap. My ML models power the intelligent products — transaction categorization, fraud detection, income verification — that drive premium pricing and competitive differentiation. AI talent is the scarcest hire in fintech, and Plaid must pay retention premiums to keep ML engineers through the IPO window."

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Premium + IPO Uncertainty Retention:** "With 50-50 IPO odds and a 15-25% AI Premium, my pre-IPO options carry significant illiquidity risk on top of the market premium for ML talent. I want a $45K–$65K Retention Sign-on because ML engineers who leave take model knowledge and training pipelines that take 6-12 months to rebuild."
2. **Intelligent Financial Products:** "I build the ML models powering Plaid's highest-value products — transaction categorization, fraud detection, identity verification, income estimation. These AI-driven capabilities command premium pricing and differentiate Plaid from competitors like MX and Yodlee."
3. **Stripe/Google ML Parity + AI Premium:** "Stripe and Google ML engineers earn $420K–$500K+ TC with liquid equity. Plaid pre-IPO options require a substantial base premium and the 15-25% AI Premium to compete for ML talent against companies offering immediate liquidity and world-class AI research teams."
4. **Financial ML Domain Expertise:** "I train models on one of the richest financial datasets in the world — billions of transactions across 12,000+ institutions. Financial ML requires domain expertise in FCRA compliance, fair lending regulations, and financial data bias that standard ML roles don't demand."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $242K base and $322K options over 4 years with a $55K Retention Sign-on for this ML/AI Engineer role. I build the intelligent products that differentiate Plaid — transaction categorization, fraud detection, income verification — the ML systems driving premium pricing behind the $4.8B run rate. I have competing offers from [Stripe ML at $438K TC / Google ML at $478K TC / Meta ML at $455K TC]. With 50-50 IPO odds and the AI talent war, Plaid must pay the full AI Premium plus retention to keep ML engineers through the IPO window." Accept at $218K+ base and $268K+ options with a $40K+ sign-on.
