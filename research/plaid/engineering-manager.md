### Engineering Manager | Plaid Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play + Bonus | Financial Connectivity Platform | $4.8B Revenue Run Rate | 12,000+ Institution Network | **IPO RETENTION SIGN-ON**

| Region | Base Salary | Options/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $215K–$268K | $212K–$375K | 15–20% | $298K–$418K |
| New York | $210K–$262K | $212K–$375K | 15–20% | $292K–$412K |
| Remote US | $198K–$248K | $212K–$375K | 15–20% | $278K–$392K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Plaid Engineering Managers are the organizational leaders scaling engineering teams that build and maintain the financial connectivity platform — hiring and developing the engineers who build APIs, data pipelines, and integration infrastructure across 12,000+ financial institutions. At the M1-M2 level, you own team delivery, technical roadmap execution, and engineering culture for critical platform domains. Your leadership directly determines whether Plaid can ship reliable financial infrastructure at the velocity required to sustain the $4.8B run rate while preparing the engineering organization for potential IPO-level operational maturity.

**$4.8B Run Rate — The 50-50 IPO Retention Play**

Plaid is operating at a $4.8B revenue run rate with roughly 50-50 odds of an IPO in the near term — creating a unique dual-outcome equity window that savvy candidates must exploit. Engineering Managers are critical during IPO preparation because they retain and scale the teams that determine platform readiness. "As an Engineering Manager joining Plaid during the IPO uncertainty window, I want a Retention Sign-on of $50K–$70K to bridge the liquidity gap. If my team fragments during the IPO window, Plaid loses not just managers but entire engineering teams — my retention is a multiplier on team retention, and Plaid needs managers who commit through the uncertainty."

**Global Levers**

1. **IPO Uncertainty Retention Bonus:** "With 50-50 IPO odds, my pre-IPO options carry significant illiquidity risk. I want a $50K–$70K Retention Sign-on because losing an engineering manager during the IPO window cascades — when I leave, my best engineers follow. Plaid needs management stability through this critical period."
2. **Team Scale and Platform Delivery:** "I lead teams building the connectivity infrastructure that drives Plaid's $4.8B run rate. My team's delivery velocity on API reliability, institution coverage, and data pipeline performance directly impacts revenue growth and IPO readiness."
3. **Stripe/Google EM Parity:** "Stripe and Google engineering managers earn $425K–$500K+ TC with liquid equity. Plaid pre-IPO options require a base and sign-on premium to compete for management talent against companies offering immediate liquidity."
4. **IPO-Ready Engineering Organization:** "I build the engineering processes, on-call culture, and operational maturity that IPO scrutiny demands. SOX compliance readiness, incident response, SLA adherence — this organizational engineering is exactly what Plaid needs before going public."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $255K base and $348K options over 4 years with a $60K Retention Sign-on for this Engineering Manager role. I lead the teams building Plaid's financial connectivity platform — my organizational leadership directly impacts team retention and platform delivery driving the $4.8B run rate. I have competing offers from [Stripe EM at $458K TC / Google EM at $485K TC / Square EM at $435K TC]. With 50-50 IPO odds, losing an EM cascades into losing entire teams — Plaid must invest in management retention." Accept at $235K+ base and $295K+ options with a $45K+ sign-on.
