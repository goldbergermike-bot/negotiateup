**Negotiation DNA**

Plaid Data Engineers are the pipeline architects building and maintaining the data infrastructure that processes, normalizes, and delivers financial data from 12,000+ institutions to thousands of applications in real time. At the IC2-IC3 level, you own the data pipelines that transform raw bank feeds into structured, reliable financial data — transaction categorization, account verification, balance reconciliation — the core data products that make Plaid's platform valuable. Your data engineering directly determines the quality, freshness, and reliability of every financial data point flowing through Plaid's ecosystem, powering the $4.8B run rate.

**$4.8B Run Rate — The 50-50 IPO Retention Play**

Plaid is operating at a $4.8B revenue run rate with roughly 50-50 odds of an IPO in the near term — creating a unique dual-outcome equity window that savvy candidates must exploit. Data Engineers are critical during the IPO window because the data pipeline infrastructure represents the core product — without reliable data pipelines, Plaid has no product. "As a Data Engineer joining Plaid during the IPO uncertainty window, I want a Retention Sign-on of $25K–$38K to bridge the liquidity gap. My data pipelines are the product — they transform raw bank feeds into the structured financial data that 12,000+ institutions and thousands of fintechs depend on. Losing data engineers during the IPO window risks data quality degradation that undermines the entire platform."

**Global Levers**

1. **IPO Uncertainty Retention Bonus:** "With 50-50 IPO odds, my pre-IPO options carry illiquidity risk. I want a $25K–$38K Retention Sign-on because data engineers who leave take pipeline knowledge that directly degrades data quality — and data quality is Plaid's core product differentiation that investors evaluate."
2. **Financial Data Pipeline Ownership:** "I build the data pipelines processing and normalizing financial data from 12,000+ institutions. My transaction categorization, account verification, and balance reconciliation pipelines are the core data products driving the $4.8B run rate."
3. **Stripe/Google DE Parity:** "Stripe and Google data engineers earn $275K–$340K+ TC with liquid equity. Plaid pre-IPO options require a base and sign-on premium to compete for data engineering talent against companies offering immediate liquidity."
4. **Multi-Institution Data Normalization:** "I normalize financial data across 12,000+ institutions — each with different data formats, API protocols, and update frequencies. This multi-source data engineering complexity at financial-grade reliability requirements far exceeds standard data pipeline work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $198K base and $198K options over 4 years with a $32K Retention Sign-on for this Data Engineer role. I build the data pipelines that are Plaid's core product — normalizing financial data across 12,000+ institutions into the reliable data products driving the $4.8B run rate. I have competing offers from [Stripe DE at $288K TC / Google DE at $315K TC / Square DE at $272K TC]. With 50-50 IPO odds, Plaid cannot afford data quality degradation from DE turnover during the IPO window." Accept at $178K+ base and $162K+ options with a $22K+ sign-on.
