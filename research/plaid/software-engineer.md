### Software Engineer | Plaid Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play + Bonus | Financial Connectivity Platform | $4.8B Revenue Run Rate | 12,000+ Institution Network | **IPO RETENTION SIGN-ON**

| Region | Base Salary | Options/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $162K–$205K | $118K–$208K | 10–15% | $198K–$278K |
| New York | $158K–$200K | $118K–$208K | 10–15% | $192K–$272K |
| Remote US | $148K–$188K | $118K–$208K | 10–15% | $182K–$258K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Plaid Software Engineers are the builders powering the financial connectivity layer that underpins modern fintech — designing and maintaining the APIs, data pipelines, and integration infrastructure that connect 12,000+ financial institutions to thousands of applications. You write the code that moves money data securely across the financial ecosystem, and every endpoint you build expands Plaid's network effect. At the IC2-IC3 level, you own critical integration surfaces and contribute to the platform reliability that financial institutions and fintechs depend on daily. [Source: Plaid SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**$4.8B Run Rate — The 50-50 IPO Retention Play**

Plaid is operating at a $4.8B revenue run rate with roughly 50-50 odds of an IPO in the near term — creating a unique dual-outcome equity window that savvy candidates must exploit. If Plaid IPOs, your pre-IPO options could multiply in value; if it stays private, you need cash-heavy retention to compensate for illiquidity. "As a Software Engineer joining Plaid during the IPO uncertainty window, I want a Retention Sign-on of $25K–$40K to bridge the liquidity gap. Plaid needs to retain engineering talent through this critical period — my connectivity platform work directly drives the $4.8B run rate that makes the IPO viable, and I need compensation that works in both outcomes."

**Global Levers**

1. **IPO Uncertainty Retention Bonus:** "With 50-50 IPO odds, my pre-IPO options carry significant illiquidity risk. I want a $25K–$40K Retention Sign-on that compensates for the uncertainty window — Plaid needs engineers who stay through the IPO decision, not ones who leave for liquid comp at Stripe or Square."
2. **Financial Connectivity Scale:** "I build the integration infrastructure connecting 12,000+ financial institutions. Every API endpoint I ship expands the network effect driving Plaid's $4.8B run rate. This financial infrastructure engineering commands premium comp."
3. **Stripe/Square SWE Parity:** "Stripe and Square software engineers at my level earn $275K+ TC with liquid equity. Plaid pre-IPO options require a base and sign-on premium to match the risk-adjusted value of competing public-company offers."
4. **Regulated Financial Data Expertise:** "I engineer systems handling regulated financial data across thousands of institutions — PCI, SOC 2, bank-grade security. This compliance-critical engineering expertise is scarce and commands a premium over standard SWE roles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $195K base and $198K options over 4 years with a $35K Retention Sign-on for this Software Engineer role. I build the financial connectivity infrastructure driving Plaid's $4.8B run rate — my API work directly expands the 12,000+ institution network. I have competing offers from [Stripe SWE at $278K TC / Square SWE at $268K TC / Finicity SWE at $255K TC]. With 50-50 IPO odds, Plaid needs to bridge the liquidity gap to retain engineers through this critical window." Accept at $178K+ base and $158K+ options with a $25K+ sign-on.
