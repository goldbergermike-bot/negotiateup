### Staff Software Engineer | Moderna Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** mRNA Pioneer / Post-COVID Growth / RSU + Bonus / Staff Technical Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge MA | $190K–$250K | $120K–$260K/4yr | 18–25% | $275K–$420K |
| Remote US | $180K–$240K | $110K–$240K/4yr | 18–25% | $260K–$400K |
| Other US | $175K–$230K | $100K–$225K/4yr | 18–25% | $245K–$380K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Moderna set the technical direction for the company's entire digital infrastructure — the mRNA design platform, manufacturing automation, clinical data systems, and enterprise architecture. At a company that describes itself as a "technology company," Staff engineers carry outsized strategic influence. Moderna's flat organizational structure means Staff engineers interact directly with VP and C-suite leadership on technology strategy. The role requires combining deep technical expertise with scientific fluency — understanding mRNA biology well enough to make platform architecture decisions that accelerate drug development. Moderna's comp at the Staff level is strong: Cambridge biotech premium, substantial MRNA RSU grants, and bonus targets of 18-25%. [Source: Moderna Technology Leadership 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Moderna Staff SWE = Google L5-L6 = Genentech Staff = Microsoft Principal

**Global Levers**

1. **"Technology Company" Frame:** "Moderna self-identifies as a technology company. Staff engineers should be compensated like Big Tech L5-L6, not traditional pharma. I'm comparing against Google, Microsoft, and Genentech — not health IT companies."
2. **Platform-Wide Architecture Impact:** "My architectural decisions affect every one of Moderna's 45+ drug programs. The platform-wide leverage of Staff-level architecture is enormous — a single improvement multiplies across the entire pipeline."
3. **MRNA Stock Upside:** "Push for $230K+ RSU grants. If Moderna's oncology and rare disease programs succeed, the stock appreciation on these RSUs could be substantial."
4. **Bonus Target Maximization:** "Staff bonus targets range 18-25%. Targeting 25% given platform-wide architectural scope."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $245K with RSUs at $240K/4yr and a 25% bonus target. I'm setting the technical direction for a company that calls itself a technology company — my comp should reflect Big Tech Staff-level benchmarks." Moderna will counter at $205K-$235K base with $140K-$210K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $350K. Push hard on RSU for stock upside.
