**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Moderna design end-to-end technical architectures for the mRNA platform, manufacturing systems, clinical data infrastructure, and enterprise integrations. The role requires understanding biotech-specific systems (LIMS, MES, CTMS, EDC) alongside cloud architecture (AWS), data platform design, and integration patterns. Moderna's rapid growth from a single-product COVID vaccine company to a diversified mRNA therapeutics platform has created significant architectural complexity. Solutions Architects design systems that balance research agility with manufacturing compliance, ensuring architectures satisfy both rapid iteration needs and GxP validation requirements.

**Level Mapping:** Moderna SA = Genentech SA = Google L5 Solutions = Veeva SA

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Architecture Scope:** "My architectures serve the mRNA platform that powers 45+ drug programs. Platform-level architectural decisions have pipeline-wide impact."
2. **Cambridge SA Market:** "Solutions architects in Cambridge biotech command $215K-$335K TC."
3. **Biotech Systems Expertise:** "I bring experience with LIMS, MES, CTMS, and GxP-validated architectures."
4. **Bonus + RSU Push:** "Target 20% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $210K with RSUs at $175K/4yr and a 20% bonus. My biotech solutions architecture experience directly maps to Moderna's platform needs." Moderna will counter at $175K-$200K base with $95K-$150K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $280K. Push on bonus and RSU.
