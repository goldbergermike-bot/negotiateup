**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Moderna design interfaces for research tools, manufacturing systems, clinical trial management, and patient-facing applications. Moderna's "technology company" identity means design is taken seriously — the company invests in UX for internal scientific platforms, not just external-facing products. Designers work on mRNA design tool interfaces, manufacturing dashboards, clinical data visualization, and vaccination scheduling/tracking systems. The user base is diverse: mRNA scientists, manufacturing engineers, clinical researchers, healthcare providers, and patients. [Source: Moderna Design and UX 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Moderna Designer = Genentech Designer = Illumina Designer = Google L3 UX

**Global Levers**

1. **Scientific Interface Design:** "Designing for mRNA scientists and manufacturing engineers requires understanding complex scientific workflows. My domain experience has immediate value."
2. **Cambridge Design Market:** "Product designers in Cambridge biotech command $165K-$265K TC."
3. **"Technology Company" Design Investment:** "Moderna invests in design as a technology company. The design role should be compensated at tech-company rates."
4. **MRNA Stock Upside:** "Push for top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $180K with RSUs at $130K/4yr and a 15% bonus. My scientific interface design experience directly maps to Moderna's internal tool and platform UX needs." Moderna will counter at $145K-$170K base with $65K-$110K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $210K. Push on base.
