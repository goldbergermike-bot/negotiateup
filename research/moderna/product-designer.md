**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Moderna design interfaces for research tools, manufacturing systems, clinical trial management, and patient-facing applications. Moderna's "technology company" identity means design is taken seriously — the company invests in UX for internal scientific platforms, not just external-facing products. Designers work on mRNA design tool interfaces, manufacturing dashboards, clinical data visualization, and vaccination scheduling/tracking systems. The user base is diverse: mRNA scientists, manufacturing engineers, clinical researchers, healthcare providers, and patients. [Source: Moderna Design and UX 2025]
