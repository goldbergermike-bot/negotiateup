**Negotiation DNA**

Moderna ($40B market cap) is the pioneer of mRNA therapeutics — the technology platform that delivered one of the most successful COVID-19 vaccines in history. The mRNA Platform Engineer is Moderna's signature technical role, building the computational and software systems that power Moderna's mRNA drug design, optimization, and manufacturing. This role sits at the intersection of software engineering, bioinformatics, and mRNA biology — building systems that design mRNA sequences, predict protein expression, optimize codon usage, model lipid nanoparticle delivery, and simulate manufacturing processes. Moderna's pipeline has expanded far beyond COVID: cancer vaccines (personalized neoantigen therapy), rare diseases, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases — all built on the same mRNA platform technology. The company has described itself as a "technology company that happens to make medicines," and the mRNA Platform Engineer embodies this identity. Moderna's engineering culture is AI-first, with heavy investment in computational biology, ML, and automation. [Source: Moderna Technology Strategy 2025, Moderna Pipeline Report 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Moderna Platform Engineer = Genentech Comp Bio = Google L4-L5 ML = BioNTech Senior Engineer

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The mRNA Platform Engineer at Moderna builds the computational foundation for a new class of medicine:
- **mRNA Sequence Design:** Software that designs optimal mRNA sequences for protein expression — your code designs the medicine
- **AI-Driven Drug Discovery:** ML models that predict mRNA stability, protein folding, immune response, and delivery optimization
- **Platform Technology:** Every new drug program leverages the same mRNA platform — your improvements multiply across the entire pipeline
- **Post-COVID Pipeline Expansion:** 45+ programs across oncology, rare disease, cardiovascular, and infectious disease

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Multiplier Frame:** "Every improvement I make to the mRNA platform multiplies across Moderna's entire 45+ program pipeline. A 5% improvement in mRNA sequence optimization doesn't affect one drug — it affects every drug Moderna develops. My comp should reflect this platform-level leverage."
2. **mRNA Engineering Scarcity:** "Engineers who understand both software engineering AND mRNA biology (codon optimization, UTR design, LNP formulation, protein expression) are exceptionally rare. I'm not a generic bioinformatics engineer — I bring mRNA-specific computational expertise."
3. **Cambridge Biotech Competition:** "Cambridge MA is the densest biotech hub in the world. Moderna competes with Vertex, Sarepta, Flagship Pioneering, and dozens of well-funded startups. My comp needs to reflect Cambridge biotech market rates."
4. **Stock Appreciation Alignment:** "Moderna's $40B market cap has significant upside if the pipeline beyond COVID succeeds. RSU grants align my compensation with the platform's success — push for top-of-band RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $210K with RSUs at $180K/4yr and a 22% bonus target. I'm building the computational foundation of Moderna's mRNA platform — every improvement multiplies across 45+ programs. My mRNA computational experience at [current company] means I'm productive from week one." Moderna will counter at $175K-$200K base with $100K-$150K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $280K. Push on RSU — Moderna stock has significant upside potential. **Floor: $260K TC minimum for the signature platform role.**
