**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Moderna build technology systems that support the company's mRNA drug platform — spanning research informatics, manufacturing automation, clinical trial systems, supply chain logistics, and commercial platforms. Moderna has described itself as a "technology company that happens to make medicines," and the engineering culture reflects this: modern tech stack, AI-first approach, and an emphasis on automation and platform thinking. Moderna's SWE roles encompass LIMS (Laboratory Information Management), manufacturing execution systems (MES), clinical data management, bioinformatics pipelines, and enterprise applications. The company's 15% bonus target is higher than most health IT companies, and Moderna RSUs (MRNA stock) provide equity exposure to the mRNA platform's success across 45+ drug programs. Cambridge MA is the world's densest biotech hub, and Moderna competes aggressively for engineering talent. [Source: Moderna Technology Careers 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Moderna SWE = Google L3-L4 = Genentech SWE = Illumina SWE (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Cambridge Biotech Market:** "Cambridge MA biotech SWEs command $180K-$290K TC. Moderna competes with Vertex, Sarepta, BioNTech, and health tech companies for talent."
2. **Tech-First Culture:** "Moderna positions itself as a technology company. My comp should reflect tech-company bands, not traditional pharma IT rates."
3. **MRNA Stock Upside:** "Moderna RSUs have significant upside if the pipeline beyond COVID succeeds. Push for top-of-band RSU grants to maximize equity participation."
4. **Regulated Software Expertise:** "I bring experience building GxP-compliant, FDA-regulated software systems. This regulatory expertise shortens the ramp significantly."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $190K with RSUs at $150K/4yr and a 15% bonus target. My experience building [regulated software / biotech systems / research platforms] at [current company] maps directly to Moderna's technology needs." Moderna will counter at $155K-$180K base with $75K-$125K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $230K. Push on RSU — MRNA stock upside is the key variable comp lever.
