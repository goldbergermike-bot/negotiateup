### Security Engineer | Moderna Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** mRNA Pioneer / Post-COVID Growth / RSU + Bonus / IP and Clinical Data Protection

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge MA | $150K–$210K | $70K–$185K/4yr | 15–18% | $205K–$320K |
| Remote US | $140K–$200K | $65K–$170K/4yr | 15–18% | $190K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Moderna protect mRNA technology IP, clinical trial data, manufacturing processes, and enterprise systems. Moderna's IP — mRNA sequence designs, LNP formulations, manufacturing processes — is among the most valuable and targeted in the pharmaceutical industry. State-sponsored cyber espionage targeting vaccine and mRNA technology was documented during COVID-19 and continues post-pandemic. Security engineers must manage application security, cloud security (AWS-heavy), manufacturing OT security, HIPAA compliance for clinical data, GxP system security, and IP protection across a globally distributed organization.

**Level Mapping:** Moderna Security = Genentech Security = Google L4 Security = BioNTech Security

**Global Levers**

1. **mRNA IP Protection:** "Moderna's mRNA technology IP is targeted by nation-state actors. The security mandate extends beyond standard enterprise protection to national security-level IP defense."
2. **Cambridge Security Market:** "Security engineers in Cambridge biotech command $205K-$320K TC."
3. **Pharma Regulatory Security:** "I bring GxP security, HIPAA, and 21 CFR Part 11 compliance experience."
4. **MRNA Stock + Bonus Push:** "Push for top RSU grants and 18% bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with RSUs at $165K/4yr and an 18% bonus. My pharma security experience with [IP protection / GxP / HIPAA / cloud security] addresses Moderna's most critical security needs." Moderna will counter at $170K-$195K base with $85K-$140K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $265K. Push on RSU.
