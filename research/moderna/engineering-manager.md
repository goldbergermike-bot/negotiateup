### Engineering Manager | Moderna Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** mRNA Pioneer / Post-COVID Growth / RSU + Bonus / Technology Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge MA | $175K–$235K | $100K–$230K/4yr | 18–25% | $260K–$385K |
| Remote US | $165K–$225K | $90K–$210K/4yr | 18–25% | $240K–$365K |
| Other US | $160K–$215K | $85K–$200K/4yr | 18–25% | $230K–$345K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Moderna lead technology teams supporting the mRNA platform, manufacturing, clinical, and commercial systems. Moderna's flat, fast-moving culture means EMs have broad scope with direct visibility to VP and C-suite leadership. EMs at Moderna must partner effectively with mRNA scientists, clinical researchers, and manufacturing engineers — translating complex scientific requirements into engineering deliverables. The "technology company" identity means EMs are expected to drive innovation, not just manage delivery. Comp is strong: Cambridge biotech premium, Moderna RSUs, and bonus targets of 18-25%.

**Level Mapping:** Moderna EM = Genentech EM = Google L5-L6 EM = BioNTech EM

**Global Levers**

1. **"Technology Company" EM Comp:** "Moderna positions itself as a technology company. EMs should be compensated like Big Tech management, not traditional pharma IT managers."
2. **Cambridge EM Market:** "EMs in Cambridge biotech command $260K-$385K TC."
3. **Bonus Target Maximization:** "EM bonus targets range 18-25%. Targeting 25% given the platform-level scope of the team."
4. **MRNA Stock Upside:** "Push for $200K+ RSU grants. Pipeline success drives stock appreciation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $230K with RSUs at $210K/4yr and a 25% bonus. I'm leading engineering at a company that self-identifies as a technology company — comp should reflect that positioning." Moderna will counter at $195K-$220K base with $120K-$180K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $320K. Push on bonus and RSU.
