### Senior Software Engineer | Moderna Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** mRNA Pioneer / Post-COVID Growth / RSU + Bonus / Senior IC Track

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge MA | $160K–$215K | $80K–$195K/4yr | 15–18% | $215K–$330K |
| Remote US | $150K–$205K | $70K–$180K/4yr | 15–18% | $200K–$310K |
| Other US | $145K–$195K | $65K–$170K/4yr | 15–18% | $190K–$295K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Moderna lead technical design for the platform systems that power mRNA drug discovery, manufacturing, and commercialization. At the senior level, engineers own platform architecture, mentor junior engineers, and make technical decisions that affect the efficiency and scalability of Moderna's technology infrastructure. Moderna's senior engineering culture emphasizes platform thinking — building systems that serve multiple drug programs, not one-off solutions. Senior engineers work on research automation (robotic lab integration, LIMS), manufacturing platforms (real-time process monitoring, batch record management), clinical data systems, and the mRNA design platform. The comp is competitive: Cambridge biotech premium base, Moderna RSUs, and 15-18% bonus targets. [Source: Moderna Engineering Career Framework 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Moderna Senior SWE = Google L4 = Genentech Senior = BioNTech Senior

**Global Levers**

1. **Cambridge Senior Market:** "Senior SWEs in Cambridge biotech command $215K-$330K TC. Moderna needs to compete with Vertex, Google Cambridge, and biotech startups."
2. **Platform Architecture Leadership:** "My platform decisions serve Moderna's 45+ drug programs. Good architecture multiplies across the entire pipeline — this leverage justifies senior-level premium comp."
3. **MRNA Stock Upside:** "Push for $175K+ RSU grants. Moderna's pipeline success could drive significant stock appreciation, making RSUs the highest-leverage comp lever."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "Senior targets range from 15-18%. Targeting 18% given platform-level architectural impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $210K with RSUs at $175K/4yr and an 18% bonus target. My senior engineering experience in [biotech platforms / regulated systems / research informatics] makes me effective at the senior level from day one." Moderna will counter at $175K-$200K base with $95K-$150K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $275K. Push on RSU for stock upside.
