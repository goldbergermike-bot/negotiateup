### DevOps Engineer | Moderna Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** mRNA Pioneer / Post-COVID Growth / RSU + Bonus / GxP Manufacturing Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge MA | $145K–$200K | $65K–$175K/4yr | 15% | $190K–$300K |
| Remote US | $135K–$190K | $60K–$160K/4yr | 15% | $175K–$280K |
| Other US | $130K–$185K | $55K–$150K/4yr | 15% | $165K–$265K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Moderna manage the infrastructure and deployment systems for both research computing (bioinformatics, mRNA design) and GxP-regulated manufacturing systems. The dual nature of this role is unique: research infrastructure needs rapid iteration and experimentation, while manufacturing infrastructure requires validated, change-controlled deployments that satisfy FDA requirements. DevOps engineers build CI/CD pipelines, manage cloud infrastructure (primarily AWS), implement infrastructure-as-code, and ensure the platform meets both research agility and manufacturing compliance requirements. Moderna's manufacturing expansion (new facilities globally) creates ongoing infrastructure scaling challenges. [Source: Moderna Infrastructure and DevOps 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Moderna DevOps = Genentech DevOps = Illumina DevOps = Google L3-L4 SRE

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual-Environment Expertise:** "I manage infrastructure for both fast-moving research (rapid iteration) and regulated manufacturing (GxP change control). This dual-environment expertise is rare."
2. **Cambridge DevOps Market:** "DevOps in Cambridge biotech commands $190K-$300K TC."
3. **GxP Infrastructure:** "I bring validated infrastructure experience satisfying FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements."
4. **MRNA Stock Upside:** "Push for top RSU grants. Manufacturing scale-up success drives Moderna's stock."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $195K with RSUs at $155K/4yr and a 15% bonus. My regulated infrastructure experience with [GxP / validated systems / manufacturing DevOps] maps directly to Moderna's needs." Moderna will counter at $160K-$185K base with $80K-$130K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $240K. Push on RSU.
