**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Moderna own the strategy for internal technology products that power the mRNA platform — research tools, manufacturing automation, clinical data systems, and operational platforms. Moderna's flat culture gives PMs significant autonomy and direct access to scientific leadership. The PM role requires understanding mRNA biology well enough to make product decisions that accelerate drug development — PMs partner daily with mRNA scientists, clinical researchers, and manufacturing teams. Moderna's "technology company" identity means PMs are expected to think like tech PMs (data-driven, platform-oriented, user-centric) while navigating biotech-specific constraints (GxP, FDA, scientific rigor).

**Level Mapping:** Moderna PM = Genentech PM = Google L4-L5 PM = BioNTech PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Product Strategy:** "My product decisions affect the mRNA platform serving 45+ drug programs. Platform-level product impact justifies premium comp."
2. **Cambridge PM Market:** "PMs in Cambridge biotech command $205K-$325K TC."
3. **Scientific-Technical Hybrid:** "I combine product management with scientific domain understanding — rare and immediately valuable."
4. **Bonus + RSU Push:** "Target 20% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with RSUs at $170K/4yr and a 20% bonus. My biotech product management experience with [research tools / scientific platforms / regulated products] directly maps to Moderna's product needs." Moderna will counter at $170K-$195K base with $90K-$145K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $270K. Push on bonus and RSU.
