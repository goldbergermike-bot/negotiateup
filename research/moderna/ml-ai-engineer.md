**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Moderna build the machine learning systems that power the company's AI-first drug development approach. Moderna has invested heavily in AI/ML across the entire drug lifecycle: mRNA sequence optimization (predicting protein expression from sequence), lipid nanoparticle formulation prediction, manufacturing process optimization, clinical trial design (adaptive dosing, patient selection), and real-world evidence analysis. The AI/ML premium is significant (15-25%) because Moderna positions AI as a core competitive advantage — not a support function. ML engineers here have the unique opportunity to train models on Moderna's proprietary mRNA data, which no other company possesses. Moderna competes with Google DeepMind, Recursion, Insitro, and BioNTech for AI/ML talent in drug discovery. [Source: Moderna AI Strategy 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Moderna ML Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML = Genentech ML = Recursion ML

**Global Levers**

1. **Proprietary mRNA Data:** "Moderna's proprietary mRNA data — sequence-to-efficacy relationships, LNP formulation outcomes, manufacturing correlations — is unique and irreplaceable. I'm training models on data no other company has access to."
2. **AI-First Drug Development:** "AI is a core strategic pillar at Moderna, not a side project. ML engineers are central to the company's competitive strategy — comp should reflect this."
3. **Cambridge AI Market:** "ML engineers in Cambridge biotech command $230K-$355K TC."
4. **Drug Discovery AI Premium:** "ML engineers who understand mRNA biology and drug development are exceptionally rare. The 15-25% AI premium should be at the top of band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $215K with RSUs at $185K/4yr and a 22% bonus. My drug discovery ML experience with [molecular modeling / sequence optimization / clinical prediction] directly powers Moderna's AI-first strategy." Moderna will counter at $180K-$205K base with $100K-$155K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $290K. Push on RSU for stock upside.
