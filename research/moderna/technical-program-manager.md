**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Moderna drive complex technology programs supporting mRNA drug development, manufacturing scale-up, clinical trial systems, and enterprise platform initiatives. Moderna's rapid pipeline expansion (45+ programs) creates significant program management complexity — TPMs coordinate across R&D technology, manufacturing systems, clinical operations, and commercial platforms. Programs often have GxP compliance requirements, FDA regulatory timelines, and scientific dependencies that general tech TPMs rarely encounter. Moderna's flat culture means TPMs have broad scope and direct access to senior leadership. [Source: Moderna Technology Program Management 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Moderna TPM = Genentech TPM = Google L4-L5 TPM = BioNTech TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Pipeline Expansion Programs:** "Moderna's 45+ program pipeline creates unprecedented program management complexity. TPMs who can manage cross-functional technology programs in this rapid-growth environment are rare."
2. **Cambridge TPM Market:** "TPMs in Cambridge biotech command $205K-$320K TC."
3. **Regulated Program Expertise:** "I bring experience managing GxP-compliant technology programs with FDA regulatory timelines."
4. **Bonus + RSU Push:** "Target 20% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with RSUs at $165K/4yr and a 20% bonus. My biotech program management experience with [drug development programs / manufacturing scale-up / regulated systems] directly maps to Moderna's most complex programs." Moderna will counter at $170K-$195K base with $85K-$140K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $265K. Push on bonus and RSU.
