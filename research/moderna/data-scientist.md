**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Moderna build predictive models and analytics that directly influence mRNA drug discovery, clinical trial design, manufacturing optimization, and commercial strategy. Moderna's AI-first culture means data science is deeply embedded in the drug development process: models predict mRNA sequence efficacy, optimize lipid nanoparticle formulations, forecast manufacturing yield, design adaptive clinical trials, and analyze real-world vaccine effectiveness. The company has one of the most data-driven drug development approaches in biotech — every decision is informed by quantitative analysis. Data scientists at Moderna combine statistical expertise with biological domain knowledge, working alongside mRNA scientists, clinical researchers, and manufacturing engineers.

**Level Mapping:** Moderna Data Scientist = Genentech DS = Google L4 DS = BioNTech DS

**Global Levers**

1. **mRNA Platform Analytics:** "My models power the mRNA platform — predicting sequence efficacy, optimizing formulations, forecasting manufacturing. This platform-level analytical impact multiplies across 45+ programs."
2. **Cambridge DS Market:** "Data scientists in Cambridge biotech command $200K-$315K TC."
3. **Drug Development Impact:** "A successful prediction model can save months of R&D time and millions in clinical trial costs. The ROI on data science in drug development is exceptional."
4. **MRNA Stock + Bonus Push:** "Push for top RSU grants and 18% bonus target."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with RSUs at $165K/4yr and an 18% bonus. My biotech data science experience with [mRNA / drug discovery / clinical trial analytics] directly accelerates Moderna's AI-driven drug development." Moderna will counter at $170K-$195K base with $85K-$140K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $265K. Push on RSU for stock upside.
