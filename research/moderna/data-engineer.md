### Data Engineer | Moderna Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** mRNA Pioneer / Post-COVID Growth / RSU + Bonus / Biotech Data Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge MA | $145K–$200K | $65K–$175K/4yr | 15% | $190K–$300K |
| Remote US | $135K–$190K | $60K–$160K/4yr | 15% | $175K–$280K |
| Other US | $130K–$185K | $55K–$150K/4yr | 15% | $165K–$265K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Moderna build the data infrastructure that supports mRNA drug design, manufacturing, clinical trials, and commercial operations. Moderna generates diverse data types: genomic/sequencing data, mRNA design and optimization data, manufacturing process data (batch records, real-time sensor data), clinical trial data (CDISC standards), and real-world evidence. Data engineers build pipelines, data lakes, and integration platforms that unify this diverse data into actionable research and operational intelligence. Moderna's AI-first culture means data quality and infrastructure are foundational — ML models for mRNA optimization, manufacturing prediction, and clinical analysis all depend on robust data engineering. The tech stack is modern (AWS, Databricks, Airflow) but must satisfy GxP and FDA data integrity requirements. [Source: Moderna Data Platform 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Moderna Data Engineer = Genentech DE = Illumina DE = Google L3-L4 DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Biotech Data Diversity:** "Moderna's data spans genomics, manufacturing, clinical, and commercial — each with unique standards and formats. My experience with [biotech data types] eliminates the domain ramp."
2. **Cambridge Market Rate:** "Data engineers in Cambridge biotech command $190K-$300K TC."
3. **GxP Data Compliance:** "I bring FDA data integrity (21 CFR Part 11) and GxP compliance experience. Regulated data engineering takes years to learn."
4. **MRNA Stock Upside:** "Push for top-of-band RSU grants. Moderna's pipeline success drives stock appreciation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $195K with RSUs at $155K/4yr and a 15% bonus. My biotech data engineering experience with [genomics / manufacturing / clinical data] directly maps to Moderna's data platform needs." Moderna will counter at $160K-$185K base with $80K-$130K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $240K. Push on RSU.
