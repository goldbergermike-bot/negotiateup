#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Rapid7

DevOps Engineers at Rapid7 are responsible for the cloud infrastructure and deployment automation of a platform that enterprise security teams depend on 24/7. The Insight Platform runs on AWS and requires sophisticated infrastructure management, container orchestration, and observability. Any platform downtime directly impacts customers' ability to detect and respond to security threats.

Rapid7 (~$4B market cap, Boston) has invested heavily in cloud-native infrastructure, and DevOps Engineers play a critical role in maintaining platform reliability while enabling rapid feature delivery across multiple Insight products.

#### Lever 1: Cloud-Native Platform Reliability

"The Insight Platform is cloud-native on AWS and serves thousands of enterprise customers. My experience maintaining high-availability cloud infrastructure with 99.9%+ uptime directly supports Rapid7's SLA commitments."

#### Lever 2: Multi-Product Deployment Complexity

"Rapid7's platform comprises multiple products (InsightVM, InsightIDR, InsightConnect, InsightCloudSec), each with independent release cycles. I bring experience managing multi-service deployment pipelines that maintain consistency across a complex product portfolio."

#### Lever 3: Infrastructure Cost Optimization

"Cloud infrastructure costs are a significant line item for SaaS security platforms. My expertise in AWS cost optimization, right-sizing, and efficient resource management delivers direct margin improvement aligned with Rapid7's profitability goals."

#### Lever 4: Security-Hardened Infrastructure

"As a security company, Rapid7's own infrastructure must exemplify best practices. I bring experience building secure-by-default infrastructure with automated compliance checking, immutable deployments, and zero-trust networking."
