#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Rapid7

This is the signature engineering role at Rapid7. Insight Platform Engineers build the shared services, data ingestion pipelines, authentication layers, and API frameworks that all Insight products depend on. The platform approach is Rapid7's core competitive strategy — unifying security data across VM, SIEM, SOAR, and cloud security to provide comprehensive visibility that point-solution competitors cannot match.

Rapid7 (NASDAQ: RPD, ~$4B market cap) is headquartered in Boston, MA. The Insight Platform processes security telemetry from thousands of enterprise environments, correlating data across endpoints, networks, cloud infrastructure, and applications. Platform Engineers who can build reliable, scalable shared services at this complexity are essential to Rapid7's market position.

The role requires deep expertise in platform engineering — building services that are consumed by multiple product teams, managing API contracts, ensuring backward compatibility, and scaling data ingestion across diverse enterprise environments. This specialization is rare and directly tied to Rapid7's differentiation.

#### Rapid7 Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3 | Insight Platform Engineer | 1–3 years |
| L4 | Insight Platform Engineer II | 3–5 years |
| L5 | Senior Insight Platform Engineer | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff Insight Platform Engineer | 8–12 years |
| L7 | Principal Insight Platform Engineer | 12+ years |

#### Lever 1: Unified Platform Architecture

"Rapid7's competitive advantage is platform unification — a single platform spanning VM, SIEM, SOAR, and cloud security. My experience building shared platform services that multiple product teams consume directly strengthens this differentiation. I bring expertise in API design, service mesh architecture, and multi-tenant data isolation."

#### Lever 2: InsightVM & Vulnerability Management Core

"InsightVM is Rapid7's flagship product with deep enterprise penetration. As a Platform Engineer, I'll build the infrastructure that powers vulnerability assessment at scale — agent management, scan orchestration, and vulnerability data processing for thousands of enterprise environments."

#### Lever 3: InsightIDR & Cloud SIEM Scale

"InsightIDR, Rapid7's cloud SIEM, requires real-time ingestion and correlation of security events across enterprise environments. My experience with streaming data architectures and event-driven systems directly supports InsightIDR's performance and reliability requirements."

#### Lever 4: InsightConnect & Automation Platform

"InsightConnect enables security workflow automation through integrations with hundreds of tools. My experience building integration frameworks and workflow engines supports Rapid7's SOAR strategy — an increasingly critical capability for enterprise security teams facing alert fatigue."
