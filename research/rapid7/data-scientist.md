#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Rapid7

Data Scientists at Rapid7 build the analytical models that power threat detection in InsightIDR, vulnerability risk scoring in InsightVM, and anomaly detection across the Insight Platform. The company's Threat Intelligence team provides curated threat data that data scientists use to train and validate detection models.

Rapid7 (~$4B market cap, Boston) invests in data science to improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives — key competitive differentiators in the crowded SIEM and VM markets. Data Scientists with security domain expertise are rare and highly sought after.

#### Rapid7 Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Data Scientist | 2–5 years |
| L5 | Senior Data Scientist | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff / Principal Data Scientist | 8–14 years |

#### Lever 1: Detection Model Accuracy

"InsightIDR's value depends on detection accuracy. My experience building classification models with low false-positive rates directly impacts customer satisfaction and Rapid7's competitive position in the SIEM market."

#### Lever 2: Vulnerability Risk Scoring

"InsightVM's risk scoring helps enterprises prioritize remediation. My expertise in risk modeling and statistical analysis improves the accuracy of vulnerability prioritization — a key differentiator for Rapid7 against competitors like Tenable and Qualys."

#### Lever 3: Behavioral Analytics

"Detecting insider threats and account compromise requires sophisticated behavioral analytics. I bring expertise in anomaly detection and user behavior modeling that strengthens Rapid7's ability to detect threats that rule-based systems miss."

#### Lever 4: Security Data Science Scarcity

"Data scientists who understand security data — attack patterns, vulnerability scoring, threat intelligence — are exceptionally rare. My combined statistical expertise and security domain knowledge commands a premium in the Boston market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $163,000 base with 1,200+ RPD RSUs. Accept-at floor: $215,000 total comp. Cite the scarcity of security-domain data scientists and your impact on detection accuracy.
