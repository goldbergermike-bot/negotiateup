#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Rapid7

ML/AI Engineers at Rapid7 build the detection and classification models that differentiate the Insight Platform from competitors. InsightIDR's detection engine uses behavioral analytics and ML to identify threats that rule-based approaches miss. InsightVM uses ML for vulnerability risk scoring and prioritization. These models directly impact product value and customer security outcomes.

Rapid7 (~$4B market cap, Boston) competes for ML talent with strong Boston-area employers and national remote opportunities. The combination of applied ML at scale and security domain expertise makes this a competitive and well-compensated role.

#### Rapid7 Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | ML Engineer | 2–5 years |
| L5 | Senior ML Engineer | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff ML Engineer | 8–12 years |

#### Lever 1: Detection Model Impact

"InsightIDR's detection accuracy is a key competitive differentiator. My experience building production ML models for anomaly detection and threat classification directly improves Rapid7's detection capabilities and reduces false positive rates."

#### Lever 2: Vulnerability Risk Prioritization

"InsightVM's ML-based risk scoring helps enterprises focus remediation on the most critical vulnerabilities. My expertise in risk modeling and feature engineering improves the accuracy of vulnerability prioritization."

#### Lever 3: ML Infrastructure & Deployment

"I bring experience deploying ML models in production with monitoring, A/B testing, and model lifecycle management — the operational ML expertise needed to maintain and improve Rapid7's detection models at scale."

#### Lever 4: ML Talent Premium

"ML engineers with security domain experience are rare. I'm evaluating opportunities at [competing companies], and Rapid7's offer should reflect both the ML talent premium and my specialized security expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $170,000 base with 1,400+ RPD RSUs. Accept-at floor: $230,000 total comp. Leverage ML talent scarcity and detection model impact.
