#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Rapid7

Senior Software Engineers at Rapid7 are the technical leaders who own architectural decisions for Insight Platform subsystems. At this level, you design scalable services, lead cross-team technical initiatives, and mentor engineers — all while delivering on the platform's mission of unified security operations.

Rapid7 (NASDAQ: RPD, ~$4B market cap) is headquartered in Boston and competes for senior talent against strong local employers (HubSpot, Akamai, Wayfair) and remote-first security companies. The Senior SWE role at Rapid7 carries genuine architectural ownership and a modern tech stack.

#### Rapid7 Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L5 | Senior Software Engineer | 5–8 years |
| L5+ | Senior Software Engineer (expanded scope) | 7–10 years |

#### Lever 1: Platform Ownership & Architecture

"As a Senior SWE, I'll own subsystems that thousands of enterprises depend on for security operations. My track record of designing reliable, scalable services translates directly to the Insight Platform's architecture needs."

#### Lever 2: InsightIDR & Detection Engineering

"InsightIDR is Rapid7's cloud SIEM product and a key growth driver. My experience with real-time event processing and detection logic directly strengthens Rapid7's ability to compete in the increasingly crowded SIEM market."

#### Lever 3: Boston Talent Market Competition

"Boston's tech market is highly competitive for senior engineering talent. I'm evaluating roles at [HubSpot / Akamai / Datadog / other Boston companies], and Rapid7's offer needs to be competitive with both local employers and remote-first opportunities."

#### Lever 4: RSU Growth Potential

"RPD's stock has growth potential as the Insight Platform gains market share. I'm willing to weight toward equity if the RSU grant reflects my expected impact — I want alignment between my contributions and compensation upside."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $175,000 base with 1,400+ RPD RSUs. Accept-at floor: $245,000 total comp. Emphasize architectural ownership and Boston market competition.
