#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Rapid7

Data Engineers at Rapid7 build the ingestion and processing infrastructure for security data from thousands of enterprise environments. The Insight Platform's value depends on its ability to collect, normalize, correlate, and analyze diverse security data streams — from vulnerability scan results to SIEM events to cloud configuration data. This is a complex data engineering challenge involving multiple data formats, varying ingestion rates, and strict freshness requirements.

Rapid7 (~$4B market cap, Boston) competes with Datadog, Splunk/Cisco, and Elastic for data engineering talent with experience in log processing and security data at scale.

#### Rapid7 Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Data Engineer | 2–6 years |
| L5 | Senior Data Engineer | 6–10 years |
| L6 | Staff / Principal Data Engineer | 10–15 years |

#### Lever 1: Multi-Product Data Unification

"Rapid7's platform value comes from unifying data across VM, SIEM, SOAR, and cloud security. I bring expertise in building data pipelines that normalize and correlate diverse data sources — the core data engineering challenge behind the Insight Platform's competitive advantage."

#### Lever 2: Real-Time Security Data Processing

"InsightIDR requires real-time processing of security events for threat detection. My experience with streaming data architectures ensures Rapid7 can process security telemetry with the low latency that enterprise SOC teams demand."

#### Lever 3: Data Scale & Storage Optimization

"Security data volumes grow relentlessly. My expertise in data pipeline optimization, compression, and tiered storage architectures helps Rapid7 manage data costs while maintaining the query performance customers expect."

#### Lever 4: Competitive Data Engineering Market

"Data engineers with security domain experience are scarce in the Boston market. I'm evaluating roles at [Datadog / Akamai / HubSpot], and Rapid7's offer should reflect both the specialized nature of security data engineering and the competitive local market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $165,000 base with 1,200+ RPD RSUs. Accept-at floor: $215,000 total comp. Cite your data pipeline expertise and the critical role of data infrastructure in the Insight Platform.
