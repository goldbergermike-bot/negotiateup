### Product Designer | Aurora Innovation Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Comp | AUR Equity (Pre-Maturity) | Self-Driving Trucks Pioneer | Pittsburgh Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Pittsburgh (HQ) | $128K-$178K | $50K-$150K | 10% | $150K-$240K |
| Bay Area | $138K-$190K | $60K-$165K | 10% | $162K-$258K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora Product Designers shape the user experience for autonomous trucking — from the fleet operator interface to the remote monitoring dashboard to the partner integration experience. Designing for autonomous trucking is a novel UX challenge: your users are fleet operators, logistics managers, and remote vehicle supervisors, not consumers hailing a ride. The interface must communicate vehicle status, autonomous system confidence, and safety information to operators who are responsible for fleets of autonomous trucks. Pre-maturity AUR equity provides growth upside. [Source: Aurora Product Design Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Aurora Product Designer = Google UX Designer L3-L4 = Waymo Product Designer = Meta Product Designer (IC3-IC4) = Amazon UX Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Novel B2B UX Domain:** "Designing for autonomous trucking fleet operators is a new UX domain with no established patterns. I'm inventing interaction paradigms for autonomous fleet management."
2. **Safety-Critical Dashboard Design:** "Remote monitoring interfaces for autonomous trucks must communicate safety information clearly and enable rapid response. Design errors in safety interfaces have real-world consequences."
3. **Pre-Maturity Equity Upside:** "Aurora's equity has growth potential if autonomous trucking reaches commercial deployment."
4. **Pittsburgh Cost Advantage:** "Pittsburgh compensation goes further, but design talent competes globally."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Aurora's design challenges in autonomous fleet management UX are unique. I'm targeting $135K in equity over 4 years and a base of $173K. I have a Google design offer at $[X]." Accept at $115K+ equity with base above $165K.
