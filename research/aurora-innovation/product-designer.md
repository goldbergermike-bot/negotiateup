**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora Product Designers shape the user experience for autonomous trucking — from the fleet operator interface to the remote monitoring dashboard to the partner integration experience. Designing for autonomous trucking is a novel UX challenge: your users are fleet operators, logistics managers, and remote vehicle supervisors, not consumers hailing a ride. The interface must communicate vehicle status, autonomous system confidence, and safety information to operators who are responsible for fleets of autonomous trucks. Pre-maturity AUR equity provides growth upside. [Source: Aurora Product Design Comp 2026]

3. **Pre-Maturity Equity Upside:** "Aurora's equity has growth potential if autonomous trucking reaches commercial deployment."
4. **Pittsburgh Cost Advantage:** "Pittsburgh compensation goes further, but design talent competes globally."
