### DevOps Engineer | Aurora Innovation Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Comp | AUR Equity (Pre-Maturity) | Self-Driving Trucks Pioneer | Pittsburgh Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Pittsburgh (HQ) | $138K-$190K | $60K-$180K | 10% | $170K-$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora DevOps Engineers build and maintain the infrastructure for autonomous truck development — simulation clusters, ML training pipelines, CI/CD for vehicle software, fleet management systems, and data processing infrastructure. Your infrastructure supports both development (simulation at massive scale) and deployment (vehicle software updates for test fleet). Aurora's infrastructure must handle GPU-intensive ML workloads, massive simulation runs, and safety-critical deployment pipelines. Pre-maturity AUR equity provides growth upside.

**Level Mapping:** Aurora DevOps Engineer = Google SRE L3-L4 = Waymo DevOps = Amazon Systems Engineer = Meta Production Engineer (IC3-IC4)

**Global Levers**

1. **Simulation Infrastructure Scale:** "Aurora's simulation runs billions of highway driving scenarios. I manage the GPU infrastructure that makes this possible — a specialized workload that exceeds standard cloud operations."
2. **Safety-Critical Deployment Pipelines:** "My CI/CD pipelines deploy software to autonomous trucks. Deployment reliability has physical-world safety consequences."
3. **Pittsburgh Cost Advantage:** "My comp goes further in Pittsburgh, but infrastructure talent competes in a global market."
4. **Pre-Maturity Equity Upside:** "Aurora's equity has growth potential. I want the grant sized at $160K+ over 4 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Aurora's infrastructure spans simulation, ML training, and vehicle deployment. I'm targeting $160K in equity over 4 years and a base of $185K. I have a Google SRE offer at $[X]." Accept at $135K+ equity with base above $175K, plus a sign-on bonus.
