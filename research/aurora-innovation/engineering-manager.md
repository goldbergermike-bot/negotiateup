**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora Engineering Managers lead teams building the Aurora Driver — the platform that will enable autonomous trucking on American highways. Leading engineering at a pre-commercial AV company requires building teams, establishing processes, and shipping product simultaneously. Aurora EMs must recruit autonomy talent in a fiercely competitive market (competing with Waymo, Google, Cruise, and every Bay Area employer), while maintaining the technical rigor required for safety-critical systems. The equity component at EM level is substantial, reflecting Aurora's need to attract management talent with AV domain expertise. [Source: Aurora EM Comp 2026]
