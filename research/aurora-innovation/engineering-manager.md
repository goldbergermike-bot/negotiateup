### Engineering Manager | Aurora Innovation Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Comp | AUR Equity (Pre-Maturity) | Self-Driving Trucks Pioneer | Pittsburgh Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Pittsburgh (HQ) | $175K-$230K | $120K-$300K | 10% | $245K-$380K |
| Bay Area | $185K-$242K | $135K-$320K | 10% | $262K-$405K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora Engineering Managers lead teams building the Aurora Driver — the platform that will enable autonomous trucking on American highways. Leading engineering at a pre-commercial AV company requires building teams, establishing processes, and shipping product simultaneously. Aurora EMs must recruit autonomy talent in a fiercely competitive market (competing with Waymo, Google, Cruise, and every Bay Area employer), while maintaining the technical rigor required for safety-critical systems. The equity component at EM level is substantial, reflecting Aurora's need to attract management talent with AV domain expertise. [Source: Aurora EM Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Aurora Engineering Manager = Google EM L5 = Meta M1 = Waymo EM = Cruise EM = Apple EM2

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-Commercial Team Building:** "Leading engineering at a pre-commercial AV company means building teams and processes while racing to commercial deployment. This dual mandate of team building and product delivery commands a premium."
2. **AV Talent Recruitment:** "Recruiting autonomy talent in Pittsburgh requires competing with Bay Area employers on compensation. My ability to attract and retain this talent directly determines Aurora's velocity."
3. **Safety Culture Ownership:** "I own the engineering culture and safety standards for my team. In autonomous trucking, this directly impacts public safety."
4. **FAANG EM Alternative:** "I have an EM offer from [Google/Waymo] at $[X] with stable equity. Aurora's equity must compensate for pre-maturity risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Leading AV engineering teams during Aurora's path to commercial deployment is a career-defining opportunity. I'm targeting $280K in equity over 4 years and a base of $225K. I have a Google EM offer at $[X]." Accept at $240K+ equity with base above $215K.
