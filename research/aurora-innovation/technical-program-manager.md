**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora Technical Program Managers coordinate complex programs across the autonomous trucking development pipeline — perception, prediction, planning, simulation, safety validation, and fleet deployment. TPMs at Aurora manage programs that span hardware (vehicle integration with OEM trucks), software (Aurora Driver stack), ML (perception and prediction models), and safety (validation against automotive standards). The path to commercial autonomous trucking requires coordinating engineering, safety, regulatory, and partner workstreams — TPMs are the orchestrators. Pre-maturity AUR equity provides growth upside.

**Level Mapping:** Aurora TPM = Google TPM L4-L5 = Waymo TPM = Amazon TPM = Meta TPM (IC4-IC5)

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Domain Program Complexity:** "Aurora programs span hardware, software, ML, safety validation, and partner coordination. This cross-domain complexity exceeds typical software TPM roles."
2. **Commercial Deployment Milestones:** "My program management directly impacts Aurora's timeline to commercial autonomous trucking. Program velocity determines when Aurora generates revenue."
3. **Safety Validation Coordination:** "I coordinate safety validation programs that span simulation, testing, and regulatory approval. These programs are the critical path to commercial deployment."
4. **Pre-Maturity Equity Upside:** "Aurora's equity has growth potential. I want the grant sized at $180K+ over 4 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Aurora's program complexity spans hardware, software, ML, and safety validation for autonomous trucking. I'm targeting $180K in equity over 4 years and a base of $195K. I have a Google TPM offer at $[X]." Accept at $155K+ equity with base above $185K.
