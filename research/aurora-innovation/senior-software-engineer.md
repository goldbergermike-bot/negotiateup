### Senior Software Engineer | Aurora Innovation Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Comp | AUR Equity (Pre-Maturity) | Self-Driving Trucks Pioneer | Pittsburgh Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Pittsburgh (HQ) | $165K-$220K | $100K-$260K | 10% | $225K-$355K |
| Bay Area | $175K-$232K | $110K-$280K | 10% | $240K-$378K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Aurora own critical systems in the autonomous trucking platform and drive technical decisions across teams. At this level, you architect systems that must operate safely on commercial trucks at highway speeds — from perception systems that work at 300+ meters to planning algorithms that account for heavy vehicle dynamics. Aurora's flat, research-influenced culture means senior engineers have significant technical autonomy and are expected to push the boundaries of what's possible in autonomous trucking. The equity grant becomes the dominant variable comp component at senior level. [Source: Aurora Senior SWE Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Aurora Senior Software Engineer = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Waymo Senior SWE = Tesla Senior SWE = Apple ICT3

**Global Levers**

1. **System Ownership at Pre-Commercial Stage:** "At a pre-commercial company, my systems decisions have outsized impact on whether the product reaches market. I'm not optimizing — I'm building the foundation."
2. **Autonomy Domain Expertise:** "Senior autonomy engineers are extremely scarce. My combination of [perception/planning/controls] expertise and production experience commands premium compensation."
3. **Pre-Maturity Equity Sizing:** "The equity grant at senior level needs to capture AUR's upside potential. I'm targeting $240K+ over 4 years — a grant that rewards me if autonomous trucking reaches commercial deployment."
4. **Waymo/Google L4 Alternative:** "My alternative is a Waymo Senior or Google L4 role at $[X] with GOOGL stability. Aurora needs to size equity to compete on risk-adjusted total comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "At the Senior level, my architectural decisions will shape Aurora's path to commercial autonomous trucking. I'm targeting $240K in equity over 4 years and a base of $215K. I have a Google L4 offer at $[X] with stable GOOGL equity. Aurora's trucking thesis is compelling, but equity must compensate for pre-maturity risk." Accept at $200K+ equity with base above $205K.
