### Self-Driving Truck Engineer | Aurora Innovation Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Comp | AUR Equity (Pre-Maturity) | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+10-20% AUTONOMY PREMIUM** | Self-Driving Trucks Pioneer

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Pittsburgh (HQ) | $165K-$225K | $100K-$280K | 10% | $225K-$370K |
| Bay Area | $175K-$240K | $110K-$300K | 10% | $240K-$395K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Aurora's signature engineering role. Self-Driving Truck Engineers build the perception, planning, and control systems that enable Aurora's autonomous trucks to haul freight across American highways. Aurora has made a strategic bet that autonomous trucking will reach commercial viability before robotaxis — the highway driving domain is more structured than urban driving, the economic case is compelling ($800B US trucking market), and the driver shortage creates immediate demand. The 10-20% autonomy premium reflects the scarcity of engineers who can build L4 autonomy for commercial trucking — a domain that requires expertise in heavy vehicle dynamics, long-range perception, highway-speed planning, and safety-critical systems. Aurora's $5B market cap and pre-maturity equity carry significant upside potential if autonomous trucking reaches commercial deployment. CEO Chris Urmson (former Google Self-Driving Car Project lead) brings credibility and technical leadership. [Source: Aurora Self-Driving Truck Engineering Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Aurora Self-Driving Truck Engineer (Senior) = Waymo Senior SWE = Google L4/L5 = Tesla Autopilot Senior = Cruise Senior ML Eng

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Self-Driving Truck Engineer at Aurora works at the intersection of autonomy and commercial logistics:
- **Highway L4 Autonomy:** Aurora's bet on highway autonomy means solving a more structured but commercially immediate problem than urban robotaxis
- **$800B Trucking Market:** The US trucking industry is massive, and driver shortages create immediate demand for autonomous solutions
- **Aurora Driver Platform:** You build the "Aurora Driver" — a platform designed to be deployed across multiple vehicle types and OEM partners
- **Long-Range Perception:** Trucks at highway speed require perception at 300+ meters — much longer range than urban driving
- **Safety at Scale:** A fully loaded autonomous truck at 65 mph has unique safety requirements that demand exceptional engineering rigor

**Global Levers**

1. **Autonomy Premium (10-20%):** "I'm building L4 autonomous driving systems for commercial trucks — safety-critical systems operating at highway speeds with heavy vehicles. The talent pool for autonomous trucking is even smaller than for robotaxis, and the 10-20% premium reflects this scarcity."
2. **Pre-Maturity Equity Upside:** "Aurora at $5B market cap has massive upside if autonomous trucking reaches commercial deployment. The $800B trucking market means Aurora's equity could appreciate significantly. I want the equity grant sized to capture this upside: $250K+ over 4 years."
3. **Waymo/Cruise Competing Offer:** "I have competing offers from [Waymo/Cruise/Tesla]. Waymo offers GOOGL stability. Aurora's autonomous trucking thesis is differentiated, but the equity needs to compensate for pre-maturity risk."
4. **Pittsburgh Cost-of-Living Advantage:** "Pittsburgh's cost of living is significantly lower than San Francisco or Mountain View. Frame: 'My Pittsburgh compensation goes further, but the equity grant should still reflect market rates for autonomy talent — I'm competing in a global talent market, not a Pittsburgh talent market.'"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Aurora's autonomous trucking strategy is the most commercially compelling path to L4 deployment. I'm bringing [specific perception/planning/trucking expertise] that directly accelerates the path to commercial launch. I'm targeting $260K in equity over 4 years with the Autonomy Premium, plus a base of $220K. I have a Waymo offer at $[X] with GOOGL stability and a Cruise offer at $[Y]. Aurora's focused trucking thesis is why I'm here — but the equity must compensate for pre-maturity risk relative to Alphabet-backed alternatives." Accept at $220K+ equity — this is the role where Aurora has the most compensation flexibility.
