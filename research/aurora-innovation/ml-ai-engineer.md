### ML/AI Engineer | Aurora Innovation Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Comp | AUR Equity (Pre-Maturity) | **+5-15% ML PREMIUM** | Self-Driving Trucks Pioneer | Pittsburgh Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Pittsburgh (HQ) | $155K-$215K | $85K-$230K | 10% | $200K-$325K |
| Bay Area | $165K-$228K | $95K-$250K | 10% | $215K-$348K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora ML/AI Engineers build the perception, prediction, and behavior models that enable autonomous trucks to navigate highways safely. Your models must detect vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles at 300+ meters (critical for highway-speed driving), predict the behavior of other road users, and plan safe trajectories for an 80,000-pound truck. ML at Aurora requires expertise in long-range perception (LiDAR point cloud processing at extended distances), heavy vehicle dynamics modeling, and real-time inference on vehicle compute. The 5-15% ML premium reflects the scarcity of ML engineers who can build safety-critical autonomy models for commercial trucking. [Source: Aurora ML Engineering Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Aurora ML/AI Engineer = Google ML Engineer L4-L5 = Waymo ML Engineer = Meta ML Engineer (IC4-IC5) = Tesla ML Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **Highway Perception ML:** "Long-range perception at highway speeds requires specialized ML models — LiDAR point cloud processing at 300+ meters, high-speed object tracking, and real-time inference. This is a specialized ML skill set."
2. **Safety-Critical ML Premium:** "My models must achieve near-perfect accuracy for safety-critical autonomous trucking. The stakes and the ML rigor required command a premium."
3. **Heavy Vehicle Domain Expertise:** "ML for autonomous trucking requires understanding heavy vehicle dynamics — stopping distances, turning radii, and load effects. This domain expertise on top of ML skills is rare."
4. **ML Talent Competition:** "ML engineers with AV experience have offers from Waymo, Google, Tesla, and top AI labs. Aurora needs to compete on equity sizing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Aurora's ML challenges in long-range highway perception and heavy vehicle autonomy are uniquely demanding. I'm targeting $215K in equity over 4 years and a base of $210K. I have a [Google Brain/Waymo] ML offer at $[X]." Accept at $185K+ equity with base above $200K, plus a sign-on bonus.
