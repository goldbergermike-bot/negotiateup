### Data Scientist | Aurora Innovation Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Comp | AUR Equity (Pre-Maturity) | Self-Driving Trucks Pioneer | Pittsburgh Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Pittsburgh (HQ) | $145K-$200K | $70K-$195K | 10% | $180K-$295K |
| Bay Area | $155K-$212K | $80K-$210K | 10% | $195K-$315K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora Data Scientists analyze autonomous trucking performance, safety metrics, simulation results, and operational efficiency. Your analyses quantify how well the Aurora Driver performs across highway driving scenarios, identify edge cases that require engineering attention, and measure the safety improvements that each software release delivers. Data science at Aurora directly informs the safety case for autonomous trucking — your analyses go to leadership, board members, and regulators. Pre-maturity AUR equity provides growth upside.

**Level Mapping:** Aurora Data Scientist = Google DS L3-L4 = Waymo Data Scientist = Amazon Applied Scientist = Meta Data Scientist (IC3-IC4)

**Global Levers**

1. **Safety Analytics Impact:** "My analyses directly inform Aurora's safety case for autonomous trucking. The rigor of my work determines whether regulators and partners trust the Aurora Driver."
2. **Pre-Commercial DS Impact:** "At a pre-commercial company, data science has outsized impact — my analyses directly shape product priorities and go/no-go decisions for commercial deployment."
3. **Unique AV Trucking Dataset:** "Aurora's highway driving dataset is unique in the industry. This is scientifically novel data that no other company has at this scale for commercial trucking."
4. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a [Google/Meta] DS offer at $[X] with stable equity. Aurora's pre-maturity equity needs to compensate for risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Aurora's data science is critical to the safety case for autonomous trucking. I'm targeting $175K in equity over 4 years and a base of $195K. I have a Google DS offer at $[X]." Accept at $150K+ equity with base above $185K, plus a sign-on bonus.
