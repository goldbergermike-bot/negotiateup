**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora Security Engineers protect autonomous trucking systems, fleet operations, and partner integrations from cyber threats. Security for autonomous trucks is uniquely high-stakes — a compromised truck control system could endanger lives and cargo, and a breach of fleet operations could disable autonomous trucks on highways. Aurora's security scope spans vehicle cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, partner API security, and regulatory compliance with emerging autonomous vehicle cybersecurity standards. Pre-maturity AUR equity provides growth upside. [Source: Aurora Security Engineering Comp 2026]
