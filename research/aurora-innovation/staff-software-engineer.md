**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Aurora define the technical strategy for major components of the autonomous trucking platform. At this level, you influence Aurora's competitive direction and make architectural decisions that determine whether autonomous trucking reaches commercial viability. Staff engineers at a pre-commercial autonomous driving company have extraordinary leverage — there are very few engineers globally with both the technical depth and leadership ability to guide L4 autonomy for commercial trucking to market. Aurora's equity at Staff level carries significant upside if the company succeeds. [Source: Aurora Staff SWE Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Aurora Staff Software Engineer = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Waymo Staff SWE = Apple ICT4 = Amazon Principal SDE

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-Commercial Technical Leadership:** "At Staff level in a pre-commercial AV company, my technical decisions will determine whether the product reaches market. This is the highest-leverage engineering role available."
2. **AV Staff Talent Scarcity:** "Staff-level autonomous trucking engineers are extraordinarily rare. I bring [X years] of AV experience. This scarcity commands premium equity."
3. **Equity Upside at $5B Valuation:** "Aurora at $5B market cap could be worth multiples if autonomous trucking reaches commercial deployment. I need equity sized at $350K+ to capture this upside."
4. **FAANG Alternative Cost:** "My alternative is a Google L5 at $[X] with GOOGL stability. Aurora's equity must compensate for pre-maturity risk at a retention-grade level."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "At Staff level, I'll define Aurora's technical direction during the most critical phase — the path to commercial autonomous trucking. I'm targeting $380K in equity over 4 years and a base of $240K. I have a Google L5 offer at $[X]. Aurora's unique focus on trucking and the leadership team are compelling." Accept at $320K+ equity with base above $225K.
