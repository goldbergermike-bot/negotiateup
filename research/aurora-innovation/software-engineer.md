### Software Engineer | Aurora Innovation Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Comp | AUR Equity (Pre-Maturity) | Self-Driving Trucks Pioneer | Pittsburgh Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Pittsburgh (HQ) | $145K-$200K | $70K-$200K | 10% | $185K-$300K |
| Bay Area | $155K-$212K | $80K-$215K | 10% | $198K-$318K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora Software Engineers build the systems that support autonomous trucking — from the core Aurora Driver platform to simulation, mapping, fleet management, and partner integration systems. Aurora's engineering culture is led by Chris Urmson (founding lead of Google's Self-Driving Car Project), bringing deep technical credibility. Compensation includes base salary, Aurora equity with 4-year vesting, and a 10% target bonus. The equity component carries pre-maturity risk — AUR at $5B market cap could appreciate significantly if autonomous trucking reaches commercial deployment, but there's no certainty of that timeline. Aurora's Pittsburgh headquarters offers significantly lower cost of living than the Bay Area, which means your guaranteed comp goes further. [Source: Aurora SWE Comp Structure 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Aurora Software Engineer = Google L3 = Meta E3 = Waymo SWE = Tesla SWE = Amazon SDE-I

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-Maturity Equity Upside:** "Aurora at $5B market cap has significant growth potential. I want the equity grant sized to reflect this upside: $175K+ over 4 years."
2. **Pittsburgh Cost Advantage:** "Pittsburgh compensation goes further than Bay Area, but my equity grant should reflect global market rates for autonomy talent — not Pittsburgh-adjusted rates."
3. **Urmson Credibility Factor:** "Aurora's leadership under Chris Urmson is uniquely credible in autonomous driving. I'm joining a company led by the person who invented commercial self-driving at Google."
4. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a [Google/Waymo/Cruise] offer at $[X] with more stable equity. Aurora's trucking thesis is differentiated, but the equity needs to compensate for pre-maturity risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "I'm excited about Aurora's autonomous trucking strategy and the leadership team. I'm targeting $180K in equity over 4 years and a base of $195K. I have a Google L3 offer at $[X] with GOOGL stability. Aurora's focused approach is compelling, but I need equity sized to compensate for pre-maturity risk." Accept if equity exceeds $160K/4yr with a sign-on bonus of $15K+.
