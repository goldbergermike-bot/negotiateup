### Data Engineer | Aurora Innovation Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Comp | AUR Equity (Pre-Maturity) | Self-Driving Trucks Pioneer | Pittsburgh Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Pittsburgh (HQ) | $140K-$193K | $65K-$185K | 10% | $175K-$280K |
| Bay Area | $150K-$205K | $75K-$200K | 10% | $188K-$298K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora Data Engineers build the data infrastructure that processes autonomous trucking sensor data, simulation results, fleet telemetry, and ML training datasets. Your pipelines process LiDAR, camera, and radar data from test vehicles operating on highways, transform raw sensor data into training datasets for the Aurora Driver, and serve analytics to engineering and operations teams. Data quality at Aurora has direct safety implications — corrupted training data could produce models with unsafe behaviors. Pre-maturity AUR equity provides growth upside.

**Level Mapping:** Aurora Data Engineer = Google Data Engineer L3-L4 = Waymo Data Engineer = Amazon Data Engineer II = Meta Data Engineer (IC3-IC4)

**Global Levers**

1. **Safety-Critical Data Pipelines:** "My data pipelines feed ML training for safety-critical autonomous driving models. Data quality issues propagate directly to the Aurora Driver. This responsibility exceeds standard data engineering."
2. **Highway Sensor Data Scale:** "Aurora's highway driving data includes long-range LiDAR and camera data at highway speeds. Processing this data requires specialized infrastructure for high-throughput, multimodal sensor streams."
3. **Pre-Maturity Equity Upside:** "Aurora's equity has significant upside potential. I want the grant sized at $165K+ over 4 years."
4. **Pittsburgh Cost Advantage:** "My comp goes further in Pittsburgh, but the equity grant should reflect global market rates for AV data engineering talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Aurora's data infrastructure is the foundation for ML training and safety validation. I'm targeting $165K in equity over 4 years and a base of $188K. I have a Google Data Engineer offer at $[X]." Accept at $140K+ equity with base above $178K, plus a sign-on bonus.
