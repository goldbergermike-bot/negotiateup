**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora Product Managers define the product strategy for autonomous trucking — from the Aurora Driver platform to fleet operations tools to partner integration. PMs at a pre-commercial AV company make decisions that determine the path to commercial deployment: which features ship first, which partners to prioritize, which safety milestones to target. Aurora PMs need technical fluency in autonomous driving, understanding of the trucking industry, and the product vision to build a product that fleet operators and logistics companies will adopt. Pre-maturity AUR equity provides growth upside. [Source: Aurora PM Comp 2026]
