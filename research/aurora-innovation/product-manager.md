### Product Manager | Aurora Innovation Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Comp | AUR Equity (Pre-Maturity) | Self-Driving Trucks Pioneer | Pittsburgh Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Pittsburgh (HQ) | $150K-$205K | $80K-$210K | 10% | $195K-$310K |
| Bay Area | $160K-$218K | $90K-$228K | 10% | $210K-$330K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Aurora Product Managers define the product strategy for autonomous trucking — from the Aurora Driver platform to fleet operations tools to partner integration. PMs at a pre-commercial AV company make decisions that determine the path to commercial deployment: which features ship first, which partners to prioritize, which safety milestones to target. Aurora PMs need technical fluency in autonomous driving, understanding of the trucking industry, and the product vision to build a product that fleet operators and logistics companies will adopt. Pre-maturity AUR equity provides growth upside. [Source: Aurora PM Comp 2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-Commercial Product Strategy:** "I'm defining the product strategy for a category that's being created — autonomous trucking. Every product decision shapes the path to commercial deployment."
2. **Industry + Technology Balance:** "Aurora PMs must understand both the trucking industry ($800B market) and autonomous driving technology. This dual domain expertise is rare."
3. **Partner-Facing PM Work:** "I'll work directly with trucking fleet partners to define the Aurora Driver product requirements. This partner-facing PM work drives commercial relationships."
4. **Pre-Maturity Equity Upside:** "Aurora's equity has significant upside. I want the grant sized at $190K+ to capture this potential."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Defining product strategy for autonomous trucking is a category-creating opportunity. I'm targeting $195K in equity over 4 years and a base of $200K. I have a Google PM offer at $[X]." Accept at $170K+ equity with base above $190K.
