### Edge Compute Engineer — Fastly Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Edge Compute Engineers at Fastly build the Compute@Edge platform — the WebAssembly-powered edge computing runtime that enables developers to run code at the edge of the internet with sub-millisecond startup times, defining the next generation of edge application development.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | Remote US (USD) |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $160,000–$225,000 | $145,000–$208,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $223,000–$295,000 | $205,000–$278,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $290,000–$373,000 | $273,000–$353,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, FSLY RSUs (4-year vest), and performance bonus (10%). Edge Compute roles command a 5-8% premium over general SWE due to specialized WebAssembly, runtime, and edge computing expertise.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Fastly

This is the signature engineering role at Fastly. Edge Compute Engineers build Compute@Edge — Fastly's WebAssembly-powered edge computing platform that enables developers to run custom code at the edge of the internet. Unlike traditional CDN edge computing (which uses JavaScript V8), Compute@Edge uses WebAssembly for near-native performance with sub-millisecond cold start times.

Fastly (NYSE: FSLY, ~$4B market cap) is headquartered in San Francisco. Compute@Edge enables use cases like edge authentication, API gateways, personalization, A/B testing, and full edge applications — all running within milliseconds of end users. The platform supports Rust, JavaScript, Go, and other languages compiled to Wasm.

The role requires expertise in runtime engineering, WebAssembly, systems programming, and distributed systems — a rare combination at the frontier of edge computing technology.

#### Fastly Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3 | Edge Compute Engineer | 1–3 years |
| L4 | Edge Compute Engineer II | 3–5 years |
| L5 | Senior Edge Compute Engineer | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff Edge Compute Engineer | 8–12 years |
| L7 | Principal Edge Compute Engineer | 12+ years |

#### Lever 1: WebAssembly Runtime Engineering

"Compute@Edge's Wasm runtime is cutting-edge technology. I bring experience with WebAssembly runtimes, compilation toolchains, and sandboxed execution environments that directly advance Compute@Edge's capabilities."

#### Lever 2: Sub-Millisecond Cold Starts

"Compute@Edge achieves sub-millisecond cold starts — a key competitive advantage. My expertise in runtime optimization, memory management, and startup performance directly maintains this technical edge."

#### Lever 3: Edge Computing at Global Scale

"Running developer code across Fastly's global network requires sophisticated orchestration, resource management, and isolation. I build the infrastructure that makes edge computing reliable and performant at scale."

#### Lever 4: Developer Experience for Edge

"Making edge computing accessible to developers requires excellent SDKs, tooling, and documentation. I build the developer experience layer that makes Compute@Edge adoption seamless."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $180,000 base with FSLY RSUs valued at $60K-$85K/year. Accept-at floor: $245,000 total comp. Cite WebAssembly expertise and the frontier nature of edge compute engineering.
