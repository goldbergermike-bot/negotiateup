#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Fastly

Fastly (NYSE: FSLY, ~$4B market cap) is headquartered in San Francisco and operates a programmable edge cloud platform.

Fastly's customers include major internet properties like GitHub, The New York Times, Shopify, and Stripe.

Software Engineers at Fastly work on deeply technical infrastructure — building the edge computing runtime, CDN caching layer, TLS termination, DDoS mitigation, and the global network that delivers content with sub-millisecond latency. The engineering challenges combine systems programming, networking, and distributed systems at global scale.
