  raw: HF DevOps Engineer = Google SRE L3–L4 (Paris) = Meta Production Engineer (E4) = Datadog Paris DevOps/SRE = OVHcloud Senior DevOps. Paris DevOps bands (€65K–€88K) compete with Google Paris SRE (€70K–€95K base + RSUs) and Datadog Paris DevOps (€65K–€90K base). HF DevOps engineers manage infrastructure at a scale comparable to much larger companies — the Hub serves millions of requests daily with a relatively small infra team.

### DevOps Engineer | Hugging Face Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Moderate Base | Open Source AI Hub | Ecosystem Moat

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Paris | €65K–€88K | €70K–€135K | — | €83K–€122K |
| New York | $158K–$198K | $125K–$228K | — | $189K–$255K |
| Remote Global | Varies by location (60–100% of NYC) | Same equity grant | — | Varies by geo band |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Hugging Face keep the world's largest open-source AI platform running — the Hub infrastructure that hosts 500K+ models, Inference Endpoints that serve billions of API calls, Spaces that run thousands of ML demos, and the CI/CD pipelines that power open-source library releases. This is one of the most consequential DevOps roles in the ML ecosystem: when the Hub goes down, hundreds of thousands of ML workflows break. You own model hosting infrastructure, GPU cluster management, Kubernetes orchestration at scale, and the reliability of a platform that enterprise customers pay for with SLAs. Hugging Face's $4.5B+ pre-IPO valuation makes the equity component (€70K–€135K / $125K–$228K over four years) a meaningful upside vehicle. Base salaries are moderate, reflecting HF's Paris-rooted compensation philosophy, but the scope and impact of this role far exceeds typical DevOps positions.

**Level Mapping:** HF DevOps Engineer = Google SRE L3–L4 (Paris) = Meta Production Engineer (E4) = Datadog Paris DevOps/SRE = OVHcloud Senior DevOps. Paris DevOps bands (€65K–€88K) compete with Google Paris SRE (€70K–€95K base + RSUs) and Datadog Paris DevOps (€65K–€90K base). HF DevOps engineers manage infrastructure at a scale comparable to much larger companies — the Hub serves millions of requests daily with a relatively small infra team.

**Open Source Impact — The Ecosystem Moat Script**
At Hugging Face, your open source contributions ARE your negotiation leverage. If you've contributed to Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, or other HF libraries — or if you maintain popular models/datasets on the Hub — you bring an "Ecosystem Moat" that directly drives platform value. As a DevOps Engineer, your open-source contributions may focus on infrastructure tooling, deployment automation, and the CI/CD systems that power open-source releases. Use this script:

"I've contributed [X commits/PRs] to [library], maintained [model/dataset] with [X downloads], and my community reputation brings [X followers/stars] of ecosystem gravity to Hugging Face. My open source track record isn't just a resume bullet — it's a direct driver of Hub engagement and enterprise adoption. My equity grant should reflect the ecosystem value I bring: every popular model I maintain, every library I contribute to, increases Hub traffic and enterprise conversion. I'm not just an employee — I'm an ecosystem asset. Grant me Tier 1 equity that reflects the community moat I bring from Day 1."

For DevOps Engineers specifically, translate the ecosystem moat into infrastructure language: "I've contributed to open-source infrastructure projects — [Kubernetes operators / Terraform modules / CI/CD tooling] — that are used by [X] teams. I've managed GPU clusters serving [Y] inference requests per day, and I've designed deployment pipelines for ML models at [previous company] that reduced deployment time by [Z%]. At Hugging Face, I'll bring infrastructure expertise that directly improves Hub uptime, Inference Endpoints latency, and enterprise SLA compliance. My infrastructure skills directly protect and scale the platform that 500K+ models depend on — that's an ecosystem-critical role deserving of top-tier equity."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "I'm targeting €125K+ / $210K+ in pre-IPO equity over four years. Hub infrastructure reliability directly impacts enterprise revenue — every minute of downtime affects enterprise SLAs and community trust. DevOps engineers who keep the platform running at this scale should be compensated at the upper equity band."
2. **Competing Offer Framing (Paris):** "I have a DevOps/SRE offer from Google Paris at L4 — €92K base with €55K/year RSUs. That's €312K guaranteed over four years. Hugging Face's infrastructure challenge is more compelling, but I need €130K+ pre-IPO equity to bridge the comp gap."
3. **Competing Offer Framing (NYC):** "My competing offer from [Datadog / Vercel / Cloudflare] is $205K base with $95K/year RSUs. That's $585K over four years. I'm choosing HF for the ML infrastructure scale and pre-IPO upside, but the equity must be $215K+ to justify the move."
4. **Infrastructure Criticality Premium:** "At Hugging Face, DevOps is not a support function — it's the foundation. When the Hub goes down, 500K+ model maintainers are affected, enterprise customers hit SLA violations, and community trust erodes. The infrastructure criticality of this role warrants above-median equity compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build and scale the infrastructure behind the world's most important ML platform. My ask is €85K / $192K base with €128K / $218K equity over four years. I have competing DevOps/SRE offers from [Google Paris / Datadog / Cloudflare] in the €312K / $585K guaranteed range over four years. I'm choosing HF for the infrastructure challenge and pre-IPO upside. My accept-at floor is €70K / $165K base with €100K / $175K equity — below that, the guaranteed comp gap is too large. Additional asks: (1) double-trigger acceleration, (2) equity refresh at Year 2, (3) on-call compensation or additional PTO for pager duties, and (4) a professional development budget for infrastructure certifications and conferences."
