### Product Manager | Hugging Face Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Moderate Base | Open Source AI Hub | Ecosystem Moat

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Paris | €75K–€102K | €95K–€180K | — | €99K–€147K |
| New York | $172K–$215K | $165K–$298K | — | $213K–$290K |
| Remote Global | Varies by location (60–100% of NYC) | Same equity grant | — | Varies by geo band |

**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Hugging Face own the strategy for products that hundreds of thousands of ML practitioners use daily — the Hub, Spaces, Inference Endpoints, Enterprise Hub, and the constellation of open-source tools that define the modern ML workflow. This is a uniquely challenging PM role because your users are among the most technically sophisticated in the world (ML researchers, AI engineers, data scientists), and your product decisions must balance open-source community health with enterprise monetization. Hugging Face's $4.5B+ pre-IPO valuation means the equity component (€95K–€180K / $165K–$298K over four years) is the primary comp lever. PMs at HF are expected to deeply understand the ML ecosystem, contribute to product-led growth strategy, and translate community signals into enterprise revenue. Base salaries in Paris (€75K–€102K) are competitive for the French PM market but significantly below US equivalents.

**Level Mapping:** HF Product Manager = Google L4–L5 PM (Paris) = Meta PM (IC5) = Mistral AI PM = Datadog Paris PM. Paris PM bands (€75K–€102K) compete with Google Paris PM (€85K–€120K base + RSUs) and Criteo PM (€70K–€95K base). HF PMs have significantly broader product scope than Big Tech PMs at equivalent levels — you own an entire product surface, not a feature within a product.

**Open Source Impact — The Ecosystem Moat Script**
At Hugging Face, your open source contributions ARE your negotiation leverage. If you've contributed to Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, or other HF libraries — or if you maintain popular models/datasets on the Hub — you bring an "Ecosystem Moat" that directly drives platform value. As a Product Manager, your open-source impact may look different from engineers' — but it's equally valuable. Use this script:

"I've contributed [X commits/PRs] to [library], maintained [model/dataset] with [X downloads], and my community reputation brings [X followers/stars] of ecosystem gravity to Hugging Face. My open source track record isn't just a resume bullet — it's a direct driver of Hub engagement and enterprise adoption. My equity grant should reflect the ecosystem value I bring: every popular model I maintain, every library I contribute to, increases Hub traffic and enterprise conversion. I'm not just an employee — I'm an ecosystem asset. Grant me Tier 1 equity that reflects the community moat I bring from Day 1."

For Product Managers specifically, adapt the ecosystem moat argument: "I've used the Hub extensively as a practitioner — I've published [X] Spaces, curated [Y] model collections, and written documentation/tutorials that drove [Z] views. I understand the user journey from open-source exploration to Enterprise Hub adoption because I've lived it. I've also led products that converted open-source users into paying customers at [previous company], growing revenue by [X%]. My PM lens on the Hub ecosystem — understanding which features drive community engagement AND enterprise conversion — is a direct driver of HF's revenue growth."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "I'm targeting €165K+ / $275K+ in pre-IPO equity over four years. As a PM at Hugging Face, I own the product strategy for [Hub / Enterprise Hub / Inference Endpoints] — my decisions directly drive revenue and user growth. The equity should reflect the P&L impact of this role."
2. **Competing Offer Framing (Paris):** "I have a PM offer from Google Paris at L5 — €115K base with €85K/year RSUs. That's €455K guaranteed over four years. Hugging Face's product challenge is more exciting, but I need €170K+ pre-IPO equity to justify the transition from guaranteed comp."
3. **Competing Offer Framing (NYC):** "My competing offer from [Anthropic / OpenAI / Stripe] is $235K base with $175K/year RSUs. That's $935K over four years. I'm choosing HF for the product scope and pre-IPO upside, but the equity must be $280K+ to make the math work."
4. **Revenue Impact Premium:** "At [previous company], I led products that generated $[X]M in ARR and converted [Y%] of free users to paid. At Hugging Face, I'll apply the same product-led growth playbook to Enterprise Hub and Inference Endpoints. PMs who directly drive revenue growth at pre-IPO companies should be compensated at the top of the equity band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the product challenge at Hugging Face — building the product strategy for the ML ecosystem's core platform is exactly the scope I want. My ask is €98K / $210K base with €165K / $280K equity over four years. I have competing PM offers from [Google Paris / Anthropic / Stripe] in the €455K / $935K guaranteed range over four years. I'm willing to accept lower guaranteed comp for HF's pre-IPO upside and product scope. My accept-at floor is €82K / $182K base with €135K / $230K equity — below that, the comp gap is too large to justify the illiquidity. Additional asks: (1) double-trigger acceleration, (2) equity refresh at Year 2, (3) signing bonus of €8K / $20K, and (4) explicit product charter in the offer letter (which products I own, reporting line, team resources)."
