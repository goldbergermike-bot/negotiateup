**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Hugging Face build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers the world's largest open-source AI dataset ecosystem — the Datasets library, Hub data pipelines, model metadata systems, and the backend infrastructure that makes 100K+ datasets discoverable, downloadable, and usable by millions of ML practitioners. This is a uniquely impactful data engineering role: the infrastructure you build doesn't serve one company's analytics — it serves the entire ML community's data needs. Your work on the Datasets library directly impacts how researchers and engineers access training data, and your Hub data pipelines determine how models, datasets, and Spaces are indexed, searched, and recommended. Hugging Face's $4.5B+ pre-IPO valuation makes the equity component (€65K–€125K / $115K–$205K over four years) the primary wealth-creation lever. Base salaries are moderate, reflecting HF's Paris-market roots, but the scope and community impact of the role far exceed typical data engineering positions.

**Level Mapping:** HF Data Engineer = Google Data Engineer L3–L4 (Paris) = Meta Data Engineer (E4) = Databricks Data Engineer = Datadog Paris Data Engineer. Paris DE bands (€62K–€85K) compete with Google Paris DE (€68K–€95K base + RSUs) and Criteo Data Engineer (€60K–€82K base). HF data engineers work on data infrastructure at massive community scale — 100K+ datasets, billions of downloads, and a metadata graph that connects models, datasets, and Spaces across the entire ML ecosystem.

**Open Source Impact — The Ecosystem Moat Script**
At Hugging Face, your open source contributions ARE your negotiation leverage. If you've contributed to Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, or other HF libraries — or if you maintain popular models/datasets on the Hub — you bring an "Ecosystem Moat" that directly drives platform value. As a Data Engineer, your open-source contributions to the Datasets library and data infrastructure are directly visible to the entire ML community. Use this script:

"I've contributed [X commits/PRs] to [library], maintained [model/dataset] with [X downloads], and my community reputation brings [X followers/stars] of ecosystem gravity to Hugging Face. My open source track record isn't just a resume bullet — it's a direct driver of Hub engagement and enterprise adoption. My equity grant should reflect the ecosystem value I bring: every popular model I maintain, every library I contribute to, increases Hub traffic and enterprise conversion. I'm not just an employee — I'm an ecosystem asset. Grant me Tier 1 equity that reflects the community moat I bring from Day 1."

For Data Engineers specifically, connect your open-source impact to data infrastructure: "I've contributed to the Datasets library with [X PRs], helped maintain [Y] popular datasets on the Hub with [Z total downloads], and built open-source data processing tools used by [W] teams. At [previous company], I designed data pipelines that processed [volume] of ML training data, improved data ingestion performance by [X%], and built metadata systems that made [Y] datasets discoverable. At Hugging Face, my data engineering expertise will directly improve the Datasets library performance, Hub data pipeline reliability, and the data discovery experience for millions of ML practitioners. Every dataset I make more accessible drives Hub engagement and enterprise adoption."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "I'm targeting €115K+ / $190K+ in pre-IPO equity over four years. Data infrastructure at Hugging Face underpins the entire dataset ecosystem — 100K+ datasets that researchers and enterprises depend on. My data engineering work directly impacts Hub engagement and enterprise data compliance features. The equity should reflect this infrastructure-level impact."
2. **Competing Offer Framing (Paris):** "I have a data engineer offer from Google Paris at L4 — €90K base with €55K/year RSUs. That's €310K guaranteed over four years. Hugging Face's data infrastructure challenge is more compelling, but I need €120K+ pre-IPO equity to justify the move from guaranteed comp."
3. **Competing Offer Framing (NYC):** "My competing offer from [Databricks / Snowflake / Stripe] is $200K base with $95K/year RSUs. That's $580K over four years. I'm choosing HF for the open-source data infrastructure challenge and pre-IPO upside, but the equity must be $195K+ to bridge the gap."
4. **Datasets Ecosystem Premium:** "At Hugging Face, I'll build the data infrastructure that 100K+ datasets depend on — the Datasets library, data pipelines, metadata systems, and data quality tooling. This infrastructure is a competitive moat: every dataset that's easy to access on the Hub increases the platform's value versus competitors. Data engineers building ecosystem infrastructure at pre-IPO companies should be compensated at the upper equity band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the data infrastructure backbone of the ML ecosystem — making 100K+ datasets seamlessly accessible to every ML practitioner and enterprise customer. My ask is €82K / $188K base with €118K / $195K equity over four years. I have competing DE offers from [Google Paris / Databricks / Snowflake] in the €310K / $580K guaranteed range over four years. I'm choosing HF for the open-source data infrastructure scope and pre-IPO upside. My accept-at floor is €67K / $160K base with €92K / $158K equity — below that, the guaranteed comp gap is too large. Additional asks: (1) double-trigger acceleration, (2) equity refresh at Year 2, (3) compute budget for data pipeline development and testing, and (4) scope clarity on which data systems I own (Datasets library, Hub pipelines, metadata) in the offer letter."
