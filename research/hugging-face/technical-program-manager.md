**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Hugging Face coordinate the most complex cross-functional initiatives in the open-source AI ecosystem — open-source library release cycles (Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets), Enterprise Hub product launches, Inference Endpoints scaling programs, and the community-facing processes that keep the world's largest ML platform running smoothly. This is not a traditional TPM role: you're managing programs that span open-source contributors (external), internal engineering teams (globally distributed), and enterprise customers — all with different timelines, incentives, and communication norms. Hugging Face's remote-first, globally distributed culture makes async program management a core competency. Base salaries (€62K–€85K Paris / $152K–$192K NYC) are moderate, with the equity component (€65K–€125K / $112K–$202K over four years) providing pre-IPO upside at the $4.5B+ valuation.

**Level Mapping:** HF Technical Program Manager = Google TPM L3–L4 (Paris) = Meta TPM (IC4) = Datadog Paris TPM = Amazon TPM (L5). Paris TPM bands (€62K–€85K) compete with Google Paris TPM (€70K–€95K base + RSUs) and Criteo TPM (€60K–€82K base). HF TPMs manage smaller teams but significantly more complex stakeholder landscapes — open-source community, internal eng, enterprise customers, and external partners — making the role's coordination complexity disproportionate to traditional TPM scope.

**Open Source Impact — The Ecosystem Moat Script**
At Hugging Face, your open source contributions ARE your negotiation leverage. If you've contributed to Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, or other HF libraries — or if you maintain popular models/datasets on the Hub — you bring an "Ecosystem Moat" that directly drives platform value. As a Technical Program Manager, your ecosystem impact comes through coordinating open-source release processes, community engagement programs, and cross-functional initiatives that keep the platform healthy. Use this script:

"I've contributed [X commits/PRs] to [library], maintained [model/dataset] with [X downloads], and my community reputation brings [X followers/stars] of ecosystem gravity to Hugging Face. My open source track record isn't just a resume bullet — it's a direct driver of Hub engagement and enterprise adoption. My equity grant should reflect the ecosystem value I bring: every popular model I maintain, every library I contribute to, increases Hub traffic and enterprise conversion. I'm not just an employee — I'm an ecosystem asset. Grant me Tier 1 equity that reflects the community moat I bring from Day 1."

For Technical Program Managers specifically, frame your ecosystem moat through program impact: "I've managed open-source release programs at [previous company] coordinating [X] contributors across [Y] time zones, shipping [Z] major releases on schedule. I've designed contribution workflows, community governance processes, and cross-team coordination systems that scaled from [A] to [B] contributors. At Hugging Face, my program management skills will directly accelerate open-source library releases, Enterprise Hub delivery, and the coordination between community contributions and product roadmap. I understand open-source program dynamics because I've led them — not just managed them."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "I'm targeting €115K+ / $190K+ in pre-IPO equity over four years. TPMs at Hugging Face coordinate the programs that ship open-source libraries used by millions and Enterprise Hub products that drive revenue. The equity should reflect the cross-functional leverage of this role."
2. **Competing Offer Framing (Paris):** "I have a TPM offer from Google Paris at L4 — €90K base with €55K/year RSUs. That's €310K guaranteed over four years. Hugging Face's program complexity is more compelling, but I need €120K+ pre-IPO equity to bridge the comp gap."
3. **Competing Offer Framing (NYC):** "My competing offer from [Amazon / Stripe / Databricks] is $200K base with $90K/year RSUs. That's $560K over four years. I'm choosing HF for the open-source program challenge and pre-IPO upside, but the equity must be $195K+ to justify the move."
4. **Open Source Release Coordination Premium:** "At Hugging Face, I'll coordinate releases for libraries downloaded millions of times per month — Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets. A single mismanaged release can break thousands of production ML pipelines. The criticality and community impact of open-source release coordination warrants above-median equity for TPM roles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to manage the programs that ship Hugging Face's most critical products — from Transformers releases to Enterprise Hub launches. My ask is €82K / $188K base with €118K / $195K equity over four years. I have competing TPM offers from [Google Paris / Amazon / Stripe] in the €310K / $560K guaranteed range over four years. I'm choosing HF for the open-source program complexity and pre-IPO upside. My accept-at floor is €67K / $160K base with €92K / $155K equity — below that, the guaranteed comp gap is too wide. Additional asks: (1) double-trigger acceleration, (2) equity refresh at Year 2, (3) clarity on program scope (which programs I own) in the offer letter, and (4) a conference and community event budget for representing HF at open-source events."
