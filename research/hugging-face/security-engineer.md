**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Hugging Face protect the world's most critical open-source AI infrastructure — a platform hosting 500K+ models that are downloaded and deployed by organizations ranging from startups to Fortune 100 enterprises. This is one of the most consequential security roles in AI: you're securing the ML model supply chain. A compromised model on the Hub could propagate into thousands of production systems worldwide. Your scope includes Hub platform security, model supply chain integrity (detecting malicious models, backdoors, data poisoning), enterprise compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA for Enterprise Hub customers), and the security posture of open-source libraries that millions of developers trust implicitly. Hugging Face's $4.5B+ pre-IPO valuation and growing enterprise customer base make security a revenue-enabler — enterprise customers require security certifications, compliance guarantees, and supply chain assurance before committing to Enterprise Hub contracts. Base salaries are competitive (€75K–€102K Paris / $175K–$218K NYC), and the equity component (€85K–€165K / $155K–$278K over four years) reflects the criticality of the role.

**Level Mapping:** HF Security Engineer = Google Security Engineer L4 (Paris) = Meta Security Engineer (E4–E5) = Datadog Paris Security Engineer = Snyk Senior Security Engineer. Paris security bands (€75K–€102K) compete with Google Paris Security Engineer (€80K–€110K base + RSUs) and Thales Cybersecurity Engineer (€70K–€95K base). HF security engineers have disproportionate scope — you're securing an entire ML ecosystem, not a single product or service.

**Open Source Impact — The Ecosystem Moat Script**
At Hugging Face, your open source contributions ARE your negotiation leverage. If you've contributed to Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, or other HF libraries — or if you maintain popular models/datasets on the Hub — you bring an "Ecosystem Moat" that directly drives platform value. As a Security Engineer, your open-source contributions may include security tooling, vulnerability research, model security scanning, and supply chain integrity work. Use this script:

"I've contributed [X commits/PRs] to [library], maintained [model/dataset] with [X downloads], and my community reputation brings [X followers/stars] of ecosystem gravity to Hugging Face. My open source track record isn't just a resume bullet — it's a direct driver of Hub engagement and enterprise adoption. My equity grant should reflect the ecosystem value I bring: every popular model I maintain, every library I contribute to, increases Hub traffic and enterprise conversion. I'm not just an employee — I'm an ecosystem asset. Grant me Tier 1 equity that reflects the community moat I bring from Day 1."

For Security Engineers specifically, frame the ecosystem moat through security impact: "I've contributed to open-source security tools — [specific tools: model scanning, dependency analysis, vulnerability detection] — that protect [X] projects. I've published security research on ML model supply chain risks, including [specific vulnerabilities, papers, talks]. At Hugging Face, my security expertise directly enables enterprise revenue: every SOC 2 certification, every model supply chain security feature, every compliance guarantee I build unblocks enterprise contracts worth $[X]M. I'm not just protecting the platform — I'm enabling its monetization. My equity should reflect this revenue-enabling impact."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "I'm targeting €155K+ / $260K+ in pre-IPO equity over four years. Security at Hugging Face directly enables enterprise revenue — customers won't deploy Enterprise Hub without security certifications and supply chain assurance. Every security capability I build unblocks enterprise contracts. The equity should reflect this revenue-enablement role."
2. **Competing Offer Framing (Paris):** "I have a security engineer offer from Google Paris at L4 — €105K base with €70K/year RSUs. That's €385K guaranteed over four years. Hugging Face's AI supply chain security challenge is uniquely important, but I need €160K+ pre-IPO equity to bridge the comp gap."
3. **Competing Offer Framing (NYC):** "My competing offer from [Anthropic / CrowdStrike / Palo Alto Networks] is $230K base with $130K/year RSUs. That's $750K over four years. I'm choosing HF because securing the ML model supply chain is the most important security problem of the decade, but the equity must be $265K+ to justify the move."
4. **Model Supply Chain Security Premium:** "I bring expertise in ML model security — detecting backdoors, data poisoning, adversarial attacks, and supply chain compromises. This is a niche skill set that fewer than [X] security engineers in the world possess at depth. At Hugging Face, this expertise directly protects 500K+ hosted models and the enterprise customers who depend on them. Niche security expertise at this scale warrants a premium — I'm asking for top-of-band equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to secure the world's most important ML platform — protecting 500K+ models from supply chain attacks and enabling enterprise customers to deploy Hugging Face with confidence. My ask is €98K / $212K base with €155K / $265K equity over four years. I have competing security offers from [Google Paris / Anthropic / CrowdStrike] in the €385K / $750K guaranteed range over four years. I'm choosing HF because the AI supply chain security problem is uniquely consequential. My accept-at floor is €80K / $182K base with €125K / $215K equity — below that, the gap versus my guaranteed-comp alternatives is too wide. Additional asks: (1) double-trigger acceleration, (2) equity refresh at Year 2, (3) a security tooling and bug bounty program budget, and (4) support for publishing security research and presenting at conferences (Black Hat, DEF CON, ML security venues)."
