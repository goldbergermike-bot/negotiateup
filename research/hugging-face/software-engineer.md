| Remote Global | Varies by location (60–100% of NYC) | Same equity grant | — | Varies by geo band |

**Negotiation DNA**
Hugging Face Software Engineers build the infrastructure behind the world's largest open-source AI ecosystem — a platform hosting 500K+ models, 100K+ datasets, and the Transformers library that powers virtually every ML team on the planet. At the SWE level, you're contributing directly to Hub features, Spaces, model hosting pipelines, and the open-source libraries that define the modern ML stack. Hugging Face's pre-IPO equity is the primary wealth-creation vehicle: the company's $4.5B+ valuation in 2026 positions early equity holders for significant upside at IPO. Base salaries are moderate by Big Tech standards — particularly in Paris — but the equity component compensates aggressively for candidates who bring open-source credibility and community gravity.

**Level Mapping:** HF Software Engineer = Google L3–L4 (Paris) = Meta FAIR SWE (Paris/NYC) = Mistral AI SWE = DeepMind Research Engineer (London equivalent). Paris base bands reflect the French market, which runs 40–55% below US equivalents for the same level. Remote engineers outside Paris/NYC are typically banded between 60–85% of NYC rates depending on cost-of-living tier.

**Open Source Impact — The Ecosystem Moat Script**
At Hugging Face, your open source contributions ARE your negotiation leverage. If you've contributed to Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, or other HF libraries — or if you maintain popular models/datasets on the Hub — you bring an "Ecosystem Moat" that directly drives platform value. As a Software Engineer, your contributions to core libraries like Transformers, Tokenizers, or Hub client libraries demonstrate that you already understand HF's codebase and community norms — reducing onboarding time and increasing Day 1 impact. Use this script:

"I've contributed [X commits/PRs] to [library], maintained [model/dataset] with [X downloads], and my community reputation brings [X followers/stars] of ecosystem gravity to Hugging Face. My open source track record isn't just a resume bullet — it's a direct driver of Hub engagement and enterprise adoption. My equity grant should reflect the ecosystem value I bring: every popular model I maintain, every library I contribute to, increases Hub traffic and enterprise conversion. I'm not just an employee — I'm an ecosystem asset. Grant me Tier 1 equity that reflects the community moat I bring from Day 1."

For Software Engineers specifically, quantify your contributions: number of merged PRs to Transformers or Diffusers, downloads on models you've published to the Hub, community discussions you've resolved, and any documentation or tutorials that drive developer onboarding. Even modest open-source activity — 5–10 merged PRs, a fine-tuned model with 10K+ downloads — can justify a 15–25% equity uplift over the baseline offer.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "My target is the upper band of the equity range — €90K–€105K / $195K–$215K over four years. At Hugging Face's $4.5B valuation with a realistic IPO path, the equity is the primary compensation vehicle, and I want to ensure my grant reflects my contributions to the open-source ecosystem rather than just my years of experience."
2. **Competing Offer Framing (Paris):** "I have a competitive offer from [Mistral AI / Datadog Paris / Google Paris] at €82K base with €70K RSUs. Hugging Face's mission is my first choice, but I need the equity grant to close the gap — I'm asking for €100K+ in pre-IPO equity to compensate for the base differential and illiquidity risk."
3. **Competing Offer Framing (NYC):** "My competing offer from [Meta FAIR / Google NYC / Anthropic] is $210K base with $180K RSUs/year. I understand HF's base bands are lower, but I need the equity to compensate — $200K+ over four years, with a refresh clause tied to performance reviews."
4. **Remote Work Premium:** "As a remote engineer, I'm available across time zones and bring async collaboration skills that reduce coordination overhead. I'm asking for NYC-equivalent equity ($180K+/4yr) regardless of my geographic location, since my code contributions have the same impact whether I'm in Paris, Berlin, or Buenos Aires."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building at Hugging Face — the open-source mission and the pre-IPO trajectory are exactly what I'm optimizing for. My ask is €75K / $190K base with €100K / $200K equity over four years. I have a competing offer at €82K / $210K base from [competitor], but I'm willing to accept a lower base in exchange for Tier 1 equity that reflects my open-source contributions to [specific library/model]. My accept-at floor is €65K / $170K base with €85K / $175K equity — below that, the illiquidity risk of pre-IPO equity doesn't justify the base discount versus my public-company alternative. I'd also like to discuss a 1-year cliff acceleration clause and a refresh mechanism at the 2-year mark."
