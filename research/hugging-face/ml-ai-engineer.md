### ML/AI Engineer | Hugging Face Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Moderate Base | Open Source AI Hub | Ecosystem Moat | **+20--35% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Paris | €88K–€120K | €135K–€255K | — | €122K–€184K |
| New York | $195K–$248K | $235K–$418K | — | $254K–$353K |
| Remote Global | Varies by location (65–100% of NYC) | Same equity grant | — | Varies by geo band |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Hugging Face work at the absolute center of the open-source ML revolution — building the Transformers library, optimizing model architectures, developing Hub ML infrastructure, and pushing the boundaries of model serving, fine-tuning, and inference optimization. This is the role that defines Hugging Face's technical moat: the Transformers library is the most widely used ML framework in the world, and the engineers who maintain and extend it shape how the entire industry builds with AI. At $4.5B+ valuation, HF's pre-IPO equity (€135K–€255K / $235K–$418K over four years) is the primary wealth-creation vehicle for ML/AI Engineers. The **+20–35% Agentic AI Premium** applies to candidates with demonstrable expertise in agentic AI systems, autonomous reasoning architectures, tool-using LLMs, and multi-agent frameworks — skills that are in extreme demand across the AI industry in 2026 and that Hugging Face needs to maintain its leadership position in the open-source agent ecosystem. Base salaries (€88K–€120K Paris / $195K–$248K NYC) are competitive for ML roles, though below Big Tech ML scientist bands.

**Level Mapping:** HF ML/AI Engineer = Google ML Engineer L4–L5 (Paris) = Meta FAIR Research Engineer (E5) = Mistral AI ML Engineer = DeepMind Research Engineer. Paris ML bands (€88K–€120K) compete with Google Paris ML Engineer (€95K–€135K base + RSUs) and Meta FAIR Paris (€90K–€125K base + RSUs). HF ML/AI Engineers have the unique advantage of building open-source tools that the entire industry uses — your work has 100x the reach of equivalent roles at closed-source companies. The Agentic AI Premium (20–35%) applies on top of base equity grants for candidates with agent-building experience.

**Open Source Impact — The Ecosystem Moat Script**
At Hugging Face, your open source contributions ARE your negotiation leverage. If you've contributed to Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, or other HF libraries — or if you maintain popular models/datasets on the Hub — you bring an "Ecosystem Moat" that directly drives platform value. As an ML/AI Engineer, you are the heart of Hugging Face's technical moat — your contributions to Transformers, Diffusers, and other ML libraries ARE the product. Use this script:

"I've contributed [X commits/PRs] to [library], maintained [model/dataset] with [X downloads], and my community reputation brings [X followers/stars] of ecosystem gravity to Hugging Face. My open source track record isn't just a resume bullet — it's a direct driver of Hub engagement and enterprise adoption. My equity grant should reflect the ecosystem value I bring: every popular model I maintain, every library I contribute to, increases Hub traffic and enterprise conversion. I'm not just an employee — I'm an ecosystem asset. Grant me Tier 1 equity that reflects the community moat I bring from Day 1."

For ML/AI Engineers specifically, this script is your most powerful lever — because at Hugging Face, ML/AI Engineers ARE the open-source ecosystem: "I've contributed [X] commits to Transformers, including [specific feature: new model architecture, pipeline optimization, inference backend]. My models on the Hub have [Y total downloads], and my community contributions have [Z] GitHub stars. I've published [W] papers/blog posts on model optimization, fine-tuning techniques, or inference acceleration that have been cited/viewed [V] times. At Hugging Face, I'm not learning the codebase — I'm already a contributor. My Day 1 velocity will be higher than any candidate who hasn't contributed to the ecosystem. The Agentic AI Premium applies because I've built [specific agentic system: tool-using LLM pipeline, multi-agent orchestration, autonomous reasoning framework] that demonstrates the skills HF needs for its agent infrastructure roadmap."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization + Agentic AI Premium:** "I'm targeting €240K+ / $400K+ in pre-IPO equity over four years, inclusive of the Agentic AI Premium. My contributions to Transformers and my expertise in agentic AI systems make me a Tier 1 hire. The equity should reflect both my open-source ecosystem value and the 20–35% premium for agentic AI skills that are in extreme demand industry-wide."
2. **Competing Offer Framing (Paris):** "I have an ML Engineer offer from Google Paris at L5 — €130K base with €105K/year RSUs. That's €550K guaranteed over four years. Additionally, Mistral AI is offering €125K base with €200K equity. Hugging Face's open-source ML mission is my priority, but I need €245K+ pre-IPO equity with the Agentic AI Premium to justify choosing illiquid equity over guaranteed comp."
3. **Competing Offer Framing (NYC):** "My Anthropic offer is $290K base with $225K/year equity. That's $1.19M over four years. I'm choosing HF because building open-source ML infrastructure is more important to me than maximizing guaranteed comp — but the equity must be $400K+ to bridge the gap. My agentic AI experience (building [specific system]) adds the 20–35% premium on top."
4. **Transformers Core Contributor Premium:** "I've contributed [X] PRs to Transformers, including [specific architectural contribution]. The Transformers library is Hugging Face's crown jewel — it's the most widely used ML framework in the world. Engineers who already contribute to Transformers bring Day 1 velocity that non-contributors can't match. This justifies top-of-band equity plus the Agentic AI Premium for my agent-building expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the future of open-source ML at Hugging Face — extending Transformers, optimizing inference, and building agentic AI infrastructure on the Hub. My ask is €115K / $242K base with €245K / $400K equity over four years (inclusive of the Agentic AI Premium). I have competing ML offers from [Google Paris L5 / Anthropic / Mistral AI] in the €550K / $1.19M guaranteed range over four years. I'm explicitly choosing HF's open-source mission and pre-IPO upside. My accept-at floor is €95K / $205K base with €195K / $325K equity — below that, the gap versus my public-company alternatives is too wide, especially given the illiquidity risk. Additional asks: (1) double-trigger acceleration on change-of-control, (2) guaranteed equity refresh at Year 2 of at least 50% of initial grant, (3) a signing bonus of €12K / $30K, (4) GPU compute budget for personal research and experimentation, and (5) conference speaking and publication support (NeurIPS, ICML, EMNLP)."
