### Senior Software Engineer | Hugging Face Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Moderate Base | Open Source AI Hub | Ecosystem Moat

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Paris | €78K–€105K | €100K–€195K | — | €103K–€154K |
| New York | $185K–$232K | $195K–$345K | — | $234K–$318K |
| Remote Global | Varies by location (60–100% of NYC) | Same equity grant | — | Varies by geo band |

**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Hugging Face own critical subsystems of the open-source AI ecosystem — whether that's the Transformers pipeline architecture, Hub backend services, Spaces deployment infrastructure, or the Inference Endpoints stack. At this level, you're not just writing code; you're shaping the technical direction of libraries used by hundreds of thousands of ML practitioners worldwide. Hugging Face's $4.5B+ valuation and pre-IPO trajectory mean that the equity component at Senior level — €100K–€195K / $195K–$345K over four years — is where the real wealth creation happens. The company knows that Senior engineers with open-source track records are their most valuable hires: they ship faster, mentor junior contributors, and bring community credibility that directly converts to enterprise revenue. Base salaries are competitive for Paris but run 20–35% below Big Tech NYC equivalents — by design, because the equity upside is the bet Hugging Face asks you to make.

**Level Mapping:** HF Senior Software Engineer = Google L4 (Paris) = Meta FAIR Senior SWE (Paris/NYC) = Mistral AI Senior Engineer = Staff Engineer at early-stage startups. In the Paris market, HF Senior bands (€78K–€105K base) compete directly with Google Paris L4 (€85K–€115K base + RSUs) and Datadog Paris Senior (€80K–€110K base). The equity differential is the key differentiator: HF pre-IPO equity has significantly higher upside potential than public-company RSUs, but carries illiquidity risk.

**Open Source Impact — The Ecosystem Moat Script**
At Hugging Face, your open source contributions ARE your negotiation leverage. If you've contributed to Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, or other HF libraries — or if you maintain popular models/datasets on the Hub — you bring an "Ecosystem Moat" that directly drives platform value. As a Senior Software Engineer, you're expected to be a technical leader in the open-source community — your PRs, code reviews, and architectural decisions shape libraries downloaded millions of times per month. Use this script:

"I've contributed [X commits/PRs] to [library], maintained [model/dataset] with [X downloads], and my community reputation brings [X followers/stars] of ecosystem gravity to Hugging Face. My open source track record isn't just a resume bullet — it's a direct driver of Hub engagement and enterprise adoption. My equity grant should reflect the ecosystem value I bring: every popular model I maintain, every library I contribute to, increases Hub traffic and enterprise conversion. I'm not just an employee — I'm an ecosystem asset. Grant me Tier 1 equity that reflects the community moat I bring from Day 1."

For Senior engineers specifically, emphasize your architectural impact: have you designed a major feature in Transformers? Refactored a pipeline that improved inference speed? Reviewed and merged community PRs that brought new model architectures to the Hub? Senior-level open-source contributions — architecture decisions, not just bug fixes — justify the upper equity band (€170K–€195K / $300K–$345K over 4yr). If you've been a core maintainer of any popular ML library (even outside HF), that's a 20–30% equity premium argument.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "At the Senior level, I'm targeting €175K+ / $310K+ in pre-IPO equity over four years. My open-source contributions to [library] and my track record of shipping production ML systems mean I'll be a force multiplier from Day 1. The equity grant should reflect that I'm bringing not just engineering skill, but community credibility that directly drives Hub adoption."
2. **Competing Offer Framing (Paris):** "I have an offer from Google Paris at L4 — €105K base with €90K/year RSUs. That's €465K guaranteed over four years. Hugging Face's mission is my priority, but I need the equity to bridge the gap: €180K+ pre-IPO equity, with a refresh at Year 2 tied to performance, brings me close enough to accept the illiquidity risk."
3. **Competing Offer Framing (NYC):** "My Anthropic offer is $265K base with $200K/year RSUs. That's $1.065M guaranteed over four years. I'm willing to accept HF's lower base because I believe in the pre-IPO upside, but I need $320K+ in equity with cliff acceleration on change-of-control to make the math work."
4. **Technical Leadership Premium:** "I've led the design and implementation of [specific system/feature] used in production by [X users/companies]. At Hugging Face, I'll own [specific subsystem] end-to-end. Senior engineers who own critical subsystems at pre-IPO companies should be compensated at the top of the equity band — I'm asking for €190K / $340K over four years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build at Hugging Face — the open-source AI ecosystem is the most important platform in ML, and I want to help scale it. My ask is €100K / $225K base with €180K / $320K equity over four years. I have a competing offer from [Google Paris / Anthropic / Meta FAIR] at €105K / $265K base with significantly higher guaranteed comp, but I'm optimizing for pre-IPO upside and mission alignment. My accept-at floor is €85K / $195K base with €150K / $270K equity — below that, the gap versus my public-company alternative is too wide to justify the illiquidity risk. I'd also like to discuss: (1) a 1-year cliff acceleration clause on change-of-control, (2) a guaranteed equity refresh at Year 2 based on performance, and (3) a signing bonus of €10K / $25K to offset the base differential during the first year."
