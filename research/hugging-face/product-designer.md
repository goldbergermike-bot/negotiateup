### Product Designer | Hugging Face Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Moderate Base | Open Source AI Hub | Ecosystem Moat

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Paris | €55K–€75K | €50K–€98K | — | €68K–€100K |
| New York | $138K–$175K | $90K–$172K | — | $161K–$218K |
| Remote Global | Varies by location (55–100% of NYC) | Same equity grant | — | Varies by geo band |

**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Hugging Face shape the user experience of the world's most important ML platform — the Hub interface that 500K+ models live on, the model card design system, Spaces UX, Inference Endpoints dashboards, and the Enterprise Hub enterprise portal. This is a design role with extraordinary reach: your design decisions are seen by millions of ML practitioners, researchers, and enterprises every month. The challenge is designing for an intensely technical audience that values information density, performance, and developer ergonomics over polish. Hugging Face's remote-first, Paris-founded culture values design as a strategic function, not a service department — designers sit with engineering teams and have significant product influence. Base salaries (€55K–€75K Paris / $138K–$175K NYC) are moderate, but the pre-IPO equity (€50K–€98K / $90K–$172K over four years) provides meaningful upside at the $4.5B+ valuation.

**Level Mapping:** HF Product Designer = Google UX Designer L3–L4 (Paris) = Meta Product Designer (IC4) = Figma Designer = Datadog Paris Product Designer. Paris design bands (€55K–€75K) compete with Google Paris UX (€60K–€85K base + RSUs) and Criteo Product Designer (€50K–€70K base). HF designers have significantly broader scope — you may be the sole designer on a product surface used by millions, versus one of many at Big Tech.

**Open Source Impact — The Ecosystem Moat Script**
At Hugging Face, your open source contributions ARE your negotiation leverage. If you've contributed to Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, or other HF libraries — or if you maintain popular models/datasets on the Hub — you bring an "Ecosystem Moat" that directly drives platform value. As a Product Designer, your ecosystem contributions take a unique form — open-source design systems, community UX research, and public design work that shapes how the ML community interacts with tools. Use this script:

"I've contributed [X commits/PRs] to [library], maintained [model/dataset] with [X downloads], and my community reputation brings [X followers/stars] of ecosystem gravity to Hugging Face. My open source track record isn't just a resume bullet — it's a direct driver of Hub engagement and enterprise adoption. My equity grant should reflect the ecosystem value I bring: every popular model I maintain, every library I contribute to, increases Hub traffic and enterprise conversion. I'm not just an employee — I'm an ecosystem asset. Grant me Tier 1 equity that reflects the community moat I bring from Day 1."

For Product Designers specifically, reframe the ecosystem moat: "I've designed interfaces for developer tools used by [X] users, contributed to open-source design systems used by [Y] projects, and I deeply understand the UX patterns that ML practitioners need — model cards, dataset viewers, inference playgrounds, and collaboration workflows. My design portfolio includes [specific developer tool / technical product] that achieved [metric: user engagement, task completion rate, NPS]. I understand Hugging Face's design challenge because I've used the Hub as a practitioner — I can point to specific UX improvements that would drive engagement and enterprise conversion."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "As a designer shaping the UX of a platform used by millions of ML practitioners, my design decisions directly impact user engagement, enterprise conversion, and community growth. I'm targeting €90K+ / $160K+ in pre-IPO equity over four years — reflecting the outsized reach of design at a platform company."
2. **Competing Offer Framing (Paris):** "I have a design offer from Google Paris at L4 — €80K base with €55K/year RSUs. That's €300K guaranteed over four years. Hugging Face's design challenge is more compelling, but I need €90K+ pre-IPO equity to close the comp gap."
3. **Competing Offer Framing (NYC):** "My competing offer from [Figma / Vercel / Stripe] is $185K base with $100K/year RSUs. I'm willing to accept HF's lower base for the pre-IPO upside and design scope, but the equity needs to be $165K+ to make the transition viable."
4. **Design Scope Premium:** "At Hugging Face, I'll be one of a small number of designers responsible for a platform used by 500K+ model maintainers and millions of users. The scope-to-headcount ratio is extraordinary — I'm not designing a feature, I'm defining the UX of the entire ML ecosystem hub. That scope warrants top-of-band equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to design at Hugging Face — the opportunity to shape the UX of the ML ecosystem's central platform is unique. My ask is €72K / $170K base with €92K / $165K equity over four years. I have competing design offers from [Google Paris / Figma / Vercel] in the €300K / $585K guaranteed range over four years. I'm choosing HF for the design scope and pre-IPO upside. My accept-at floor is €60K / $148K base with €72K / $130K equity — below that, the comp gap relative to public-company alternatives is too wide. Additional asks: (1) double-trigger acceleration, (2) equity refresh at Year 2, (3) a design tools budget (Figma, usability testing tools), and (4) clarity on design team structure and reporting line in the offer letter."
