**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Hugging Face lead the teams building the open-source AI infrastructure that powers the ML community — Transformers, Hub backend, Inference Endpoints, Spaces, and the Enterprise Hub product. This is not a typical EM role: you're managing engineers who are open-source community leaders, and your ability to attract, retain, and develop top open-source contributors directly drives Hugging Face's platform moat. The company's remote-first culture (Paris-founded, globally distributed) means you're managing across time zones and cultures, requiring strong async leadership skills. At $4.5B+ valuation, HF's pre-IPO equity (€140K–€262K / $255K–$448K over four years) is the primary wealth-creation lever for EMs. Base salaries are competitive for Paris-market management roles but run below Big Tech NYC EM bands — the equity compensates for this by design.

**Level Mapping:** HF Engineering Manager = Google L5 Engineering Manager (Paris) = Meta FAIR EM (M1) = Mistral AI Engineering Lead = Datadog Paris EM. In Paris, HF EM base bands (€92K–€125K) compete with Google Paris EM (€110K–€145K base + RSUs) and Datadog Paris EM (€95K–€130K base). The equity structure — pre-IPO options versus public RSUs — is the key differentiator. HF EMs manage smaller, higher-impact teams (typically 5–10 engineers) compared to Big Tech EMs who manage 8–15+.

**Open Source Impact — The Ecosystem Moat Script**
At Hugging Face, your open source contributions ARE your negotiation leverage. If you've contributed to Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, or other HF libraries — or if you maintain popular models/datasets on the Hub — you bring an "Ecosystem Moat" that directly drives platform value. As an Engineering Manager, your open-source impact is amplified through the teams you lead — but your personal contributions and community reputation also matter. Use this script:

"I've contributed [X commits/PRs] to [library], maintained [model/dataset] with [X downloads], and my community reputation brings [X followers/stars] of ecosystem gravity to Hugging Face. My open source track record isn't just a resume bullet — it's a direct driver of Hub engagement and enterprise adoption. My equity grant should reflect the ecosystem value I bring: every popular model I maintain, every library I contribute to, increases Hub traffic and enterprise conversion. I'm not just an employee — I'm an ecosystem asset. Grant me Tier 1 equity that reflects the community moat I bring from Day 1."

For Engineering Managers specifically, extend this to your team-building leverage: "I've built and led teams of [X] engineers who have collectively contributed [Y] PRs to open-source projects, published [Z] models on the Hub, and grown community engagement by [metric]. My ability to attract top open-source talent — engineers who follow me because of my community reputation — is a multiplier on HF's ecosystem moat. My equity should reflect not just my individual contributions, but my capacity to recruit and retain the open-source engineers who make Hugging Face the center of the ML universe."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "As an EM, my leverage is my ability to attract and retain the best open-source engineers in ML. That's a direct driver of Hugging Face's platform value. I'm targeting €240K+ / $420K+ in pre-IPO equity over four years — reflecting the multiplier effect of building high-performing teams that ship open-source infrastructure used by millions."
2. **Competing Offer Framing (Paris):** "I have an EM offer from Google Paris at L5 — €130K base with €100K/year RSUs. That's €530K guaranteed over four years. Hugging Face's mission is my priority, but I need €250K+ pre-IPO equity with double-trigger acceleration to justify the move from guaranteed public-company comp."
3. **Competing Offer Framing (NYC):** "My competing EM offer from [Anthropic / Meta FAIR] is $275K base with $200K/year RSUs. That's $1.075M over four years. I'm willing to take lower guaranteed comp for pre-IPO upside, but the equity grant must be $400K+ to bridge the gap — and I need a refresh clause at Year 2."
4. **Team-Building Premium:** "I've built engineering teams from [X] to [Y] engineers, with [Z]% retention rate. At Hugging Face's stage, the ability to recruit top open-source talent is existentially important. My network and reputation in the ML community will reduce time-to-hire and increase offer acceptance rates — that's a direct cost savings and ecosystem growth driver worth a premium equity grant."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply aligned with Hugging Face's mission to democratize ML through open source, and I want to lead a team that makes the Hub the indispensable platform for every ML practitioner. My ask is €120K / $248K base with €245K / $420K equity over four years. I have competing EM offers from [Google Paris / Anthropic / Meta FAIR] in the €530K / $1.075M guaranteed range over four years. I'm explicitly choosing HF's pre-IPO trajectory, but the equity needs to reflect my team-building and open-source leverage. My accept-at floor is €100K / $215K base with €200K / $350K equity — below that, the gap is too wide. Additional asks: (1) double-trigger acceleration on change-of-control, (2) guaranteed equity refresh at Year 2, (3) a signing bonus of €12K / $30K, and (4) explicit scope commitment in the offer letter (team size, charter, reporting line)."
