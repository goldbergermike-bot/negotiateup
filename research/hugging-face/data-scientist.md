### Data Scientist | Hugging Face Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Moderate Base | Open Source AI Hub | Ecosystem Moat

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Paris | €68K–€92K | €75K–€148K | — | €87K–€129K |
| New York | $162K–$205K | $135K–$248K | — | $196K–$267K |
| Remote Global | Varies by location (60–100% of NYC) | Same equity grant | — | Varies by geo band |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Hugging Face sit at the intersection of platform analytics, community intelligence, and product strategy. You analyze how 500K+ models are used, which datasets drive the most engagement, how community contributions convert into enterprise revenue, and what Hub metrics signal product-market fit. This is not a traditional business analytics DS role — you're working with ML-native data (model download patterns, inference usage, community contribution graphs, enterprise adoption funnels) and your insights directly shape product roadmap and monetization strategy. Hugging Face's $4.5B+ pre-IPO valuation gives the equity component (€75K–€148K / $135K–$248K over four years) meaningful upside potential. Base salaries are moderate by Big Tech DS standards, particularly in Paris, but the role's scope — you're the analytics brain for the world's most important ML platform — is unmatched.

**Level Mapping:** HF Data Scientist = Google L3–L4 Data Scientist (Paris) = Meta Data Scientist (IC4–IC5) = Datadog Paris Data Scientist = Mistral AI Data Analyst. Paris DS bands (€68K–€92K) compete with Google Paris DS (€70K–€100K base + RSUs) and Criteo Data Scientist (€65K–€90K base). HF data scientists have broader scope — you're not analyzing one product vertical, you're analyzing the entire ML ecosystem's usage patterns.

**Open Source Impact — The Ecosystem Moat Script**
At Hugging Face, your open source contributions ARE your negotiation leverage. If you've contributed to Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, or other HF libraries — or if you maintain popular models/datasets on the Hub — you bring an "Ecosystem Moat" that directly drives platform value. As a Data Scientist, your open-source contributions may include published datasets, analysis notebooks, or community-facing analytics dashboards. Use this script:

"I've contributed [X commits/PRs] to [library], maintained [model/dataset] with [X downloads], and my community reputation brings [X followers/stars] of ecosystem gravity to Hugging Face. My open source track record isn't just a resume bullet — it's a direct driver of Hub engagement and enterprise adoption. My equity grant should reflect the ecosystem value I bring: every popular model I maintain, every library I contribute to, increases Hub traffic and enterprise conversion. I'm not just an employee — I'm an ecosystem asset. Grant me Tier 1 equity that reflects the community moat I bring from Day 1."

For Data Scientists specifically, emphasize your analytical contributions to the open-source ecosystem: "I've published [X] datasets on the Hub with [Y total downloads], created analysis notebooks that have [Z] views, and contributed to the Datasets library with [W PRs]. I've also analyzed open-source community dynamics at [previous company], identifying engagement patterns that drove [metric] growth. At Hugging Face, my ability to turn Hub usage data into product and monetization insights is directly tied to revenue growth — I understand the data because I'm part of the community that generates it."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "I'm targeting €135K+ / $230K+ in pre-IPO equity over four years. My analytics work will directly inform Hub monetization strategy, Enterprise Hub pricing, and Inference Endpoints product-market fit. Data scientists who drive revenue-impacting insights at pre-IPO companies should be compensated at Tier 1 equity levels."
2. **Competing Offer Framing (Paris):** "I have a DS offer from Google Paris at L4 — €95K base with €65K/year RSUs. That's €355K guaranteed over four years. Hugging Face's data challenge is more compelling, but I need €140K+ pre-IPO equity to bridge the guaranteed comp gap."
3. **Competing Offer Framing (NYC):** "My competing offer from [Anthropic / Spotify / Stripe] is $215K base with $130K/year RSUs. That's $735K over four years. I'm choosing HF for the platform-scale data challenge and pre-IPO upside, but the equity needs to be $235K+ to make the transition viable."
4. **Platform Analytics Premium:** "At Hugging Face, I'm not analyzing a single product — I'm analyzing the engagement, adoption, and monetization patterns of the entire ML ecosystem's platform. Hub analytics inform product roadmap, pricing strategy, and enterprise sales. This scope warrants DS compensation at the top of the equity band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to be the analytics engine behind Hugging Face's platform growth — understanding how 500K+ models are used, which community patterns drive enterprise conversion, and where the next revenue opportunity lives. My ask is €88K / $200K base with €138K / $235K equity over four years. I have competing DS offers from [Google Paris / Anthropic / Stripe] in the €355K / $735K guaranteed range over four years. I'm choosing HF for the data challenge and pre-IPO upside. My accept-at floor is €73K / $172K base with €110K / $190K equity — below that, the gap is too wide. Additional asks: (1) double-trigger acceleration, (2) equity refresh at Year 2, (3) a data infrastructure budget (compute, tooling), and (4) scope clarity on which Hub data surfaces I own."
