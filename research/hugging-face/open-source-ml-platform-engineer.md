**Negotiation DNA**
The Open Source ML Platform Engineer is Hugging Face's **signature role** — the position that defines the company's technical identity and competitive moat. You build the Hub infrastructure that 500K+ models depend on, the Inference Endpoints that serve billions of ML predictions, the Spaces platform that hosts thousands of ML demos, and the open-source libraries (Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, Tokenizers, Accelerate) that are the backbone of the modern ML stack. This is not a platform engineering role at a company that uses ML — this is THE platform engineering role at the company that IS the ML platform. Every architectural decision you make ripples across the entire ML ecosystem: when you optimize model loading, every practitioner benefits; when you scale Inference Endpoints, every enterprise customer gets better latency; when you improve the Hub's Git LFS storage, every model maintainer has a better experience. Hugging Face's $4.5B+ pre-IPO valuation makes the equity component (€165K–€305K / $275K–$488K over four years) the most significant compensation lever — and the **+20–35% Agentic AI Premium** further boosts grants for candidates who bring expertise in agentic AI systems, autonomous reasoning architectures, and multi-agent frameworks that are central to HF's platform roadmap in 2026 and beyond. This is a franchise-level hire: Hugging Face competes against Google, Meta FAIR, Anthropic, Mistral AI, and every frontier AI lab in the world for these engineers.

**Level Mapping:** HF Open Source ML Platform Engineer = Google L5+ Platform Engineer (Paris) = Meta FAIR Staff Research Engineer (E6) = Mistral AI Lead Platform Engineer = DeepMind Staff Research Engineer. This role sits between Senior and Staff in formal leveling but carries Staff-equivalent scope and impact due to the ecosystem-defining nature of the work. Paris bands (€98K–€132K base) compete with Google Paris L5 (€120K–€155K base + RSUs) and Meta FAIR Paris Staff (€115K–€145K base + RSUs). In NYC, the $210K–$262K base competes with Anthropic Staff ($280K–$330K base + equity) and OpenAI Platform Engineer ($270K–$320K base + equity). The equity differential — pre-IPO at $4.5B with realistic IPO path versus public-company RSUs — is the critical negotiation axis.

**Open Source Impact — The Ecosystem Moat Script**
At Hugging Face, your open source contributions ARE your negotiation leverage. If you've contributed to Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, or other HF libraries — or if you maintain popular models/datasets on the Hub — you bring an "Ecosystem Moat" that directly drives platform value. As the **signature role** at Hugging Face, the Open Source ML Platform Engineer IS the ecosystem moat. You don't just contribute to the open-source ecosystem — you architect and maintain the infrastructure it runs on. Use this script:

"I've contributed [X commits/PRs] to [library], maintained [model/dataset] with [X downloads], and my community reputation brings [X followers/stars] of ecosystem gravity to Hugging Face. My open source track record isn't just a resume bullet — it's a direct driver of Hub engagement and enterprise adoption. My equity grant should reflect the ecosystem value I bring: every popular model I maintain, every library I contribute to, increases Hub traffic and enterprise conversion. I'm not just an employee — I'm an ecosystem asset. Grant me Tier 1 equity that reflects the community moat I bring from Day 1."

For Open Source ML Platform Engineers specifically, this script reaches its maximum power — because this role IS the ecosystem: "I've contributed [X] commits to [Transformers / Diffusers / Hub infrastructure], including [specific platform-level contributions: model serving architecture, Hub storage optimization, Inference Endpoints scaling, library release infrastructure]. My models/datasets on the Hub have [Y total downloads], my open-source tools have [Z] GitHub stars, and I'm recognized in the ML community through [conference talks, blog posts, community leadership]. I don't just use the Hugging Face ecosystem — I've helped build it. My Day 1 impact will be immediate because I already understand the codebase, the community norms, and the platform architecture. Furthermore, my expertise in agentic AI systems — specifically [tool-using LLM orchestration, multi-agent deployment infrastructure, autonomous reasoning pipelines] — directly maps to Hugging Face's 2026 platform roadmap for agent hosting and orchestration. I'm bringing both ecosystem moat and frontier AI skills. My equity grant should be Tier 1 — €280K+ / $460K+ over four years — reflecting that I'm not just filling a role, I'm extending the platform that defines the entire ML industry."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization + Agentic AI Premium:** "I'm targeting €290K+ / $475K+ in pre-IPO equity over four years, inclusive of the Agentic AI Premium. As an Open Source ML Platform Engineer — Hugging Face's signature role — I build the infrastructure that 500K+ models depend on. My open-source contributions, community reputation, and agentic AI expertise justify Tier 1 equity. At $4.5B valuation with a realistic IPO path, this equity could be worth 3–5x — and my platform contributions will directly drive the valuation growth."
2. **Competing Offer Framing (Paris):** "I have offers from Google Paris at L5 (€148K base with €115K/year RSUs = €608K over 4yr) and Mistral AI (€135K base with €250K equity). Hugging Face's open-source platform mission is my first choice, but the equity must be €290K+ to justify choosing pre-IPO illiquidity over guaranteed Big Tech comp. I'm also applying the Agentic AI Premium given my experience building [specific agent infrastructure]."
3. **Competing Offer Framing (NYC):** "My competing offers: Anthropic at $310K base with $240K/year equity ($1.27M over 4yr), and OpenAI Platform Engineer at $295K base with $220K/year equity ($1.175M over 4yr). I'm choosing Hugging Face because open-source AI infrastructure is more important than any single model company — but the equity must be $475K+ to bridge the guaranteed comp gap. This is a conscious bet on HF's pre-IPO trajectory, and the equity grant needs to make that bet rational."
4. **Signature Role Premium:** "This is Hugging Face's defining engineering role — the platform engineer who builds the infrastructure that the entire ML ecosystem depends on. There are perhaps 50 engineers in the world who can do this job at the level HF needs: deep platform engineering expertise, open-source community leadership, ML infrastructure experience, and agentic AI skills. The scarcity premium for this combination is real — I'm asking for top-of-band equity (€300K+ / $480K+) because the talent market for this exact role profile is extremely thin."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "The Open Source ML Platform Engineer role at Hugging Face is exactly where I want to build — I want to architect the platform infrastructure that 500K+ models and millions of ML practitioners depend on. This is Hugging Face's signature engineering role, and I intend to negotiate accordingly. My ask is €128K / $255K base with €295K / $478K equity over four years (inclusive of the Agentic AI Premium). I have competing offers from [Google Paris L5 / Anthropic / OpenAI] in the €608K / $1.27M guaranteed range over four years. I am explicitly choosing Hugging Face's pre-IPO open-source mission over guaranteed public-company comp — but the equity grant must justify that choice. My accept-at floor is €105K / $220K base with €240K / $390K equity — below that, the risk-adjusted math versus my Big Tech alternatives breaks down, and I cannot responsibly accept. This is Hugging Face's franchise hire — the engineer who builds the platform that defines the company's moat. Compensate it accordingly. Additional asks: (1) double-trigger acceleration on change-of-control with 100% vesting, (2) guaranteed equity refresh at Year 2 of at least 60% of initial grant, (3) a signing bonus of €18K / $45K to bridge the first-year base gap, (4) GPU compute budget for personal research and experimentation ($50K+/year), (5) conference speaking and open-source community engagement budget, (6) explicit title and scope guarantee in the offer letter (Open Source ML Platform Engineer, reporting to [VP Eng / CTO], owning [Hub infrastructure / Inference Endpoints / library infrastructure]), and (7) a seat at the technical architecture table — this role should have input into HF's platform roadmap, not just execute on it."
