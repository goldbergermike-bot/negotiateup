Security Engineers at HubSpot protect a platform that processes sensitive customer data for hundreds of thousands of businesses across CRM, marketing, sales, and service functions. The role spans application security, infrastructure security, identity and access management, compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA), and incident response. With Breeze AI introducing LLM-powered features, AI security (prompt injection, data leakage, model security) is an emerging specialty with premium demand.

#### Double-Trigger Acceleration Check

HubSpot M&A Protection — Double-Trigger Acceleration Check: HubSpot has been the subject of acquisition interest (Google was reportedly in talks). Before accepting, verify your RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration: if HubSpot is acquired AND you are terminated or role-changed within 12-24 months post-acquisition, 50-100% of your unvested RSUs accelerate immediately. Use this script: "Given the M&A environment for companies like HubSpot, I'd like to confirm my RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration provisions. Specifically, if HubSpot is acquired and my role is materially changed or eliminated within [12/18/24] months, I want [50/75/100]% of unvested RSUs to vest immediately." If HubSpot's standard agreement doesn't include this, negotiate it as a side letter — especially for senior roles.

#### Global Negotiation Levers

1. **Base Salary Lever — Data Trust & Compliance Premium:** HubSpot processes sensitive CRM data under SOC 2, GDPR, and industry-specific compliance requirements. Security engineers protecting this data carry outsized responsibility: "HubSpot holds sensitive data for 200K+ customers across multiple regulatory regimes (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA). My experience in [compliance domain / application security / cloud security] directly protects HubSpot's trust and revenue. I'm targeting $[target] base."

2. **Equity Lever — AI Security Specialization:** Breeze AI introduces new attack surfaces (prompt injection, data exfiltration via LLM, model manipulation). If you bring AI/ML security expertise, demand premium RSU: "AI copilot features like Breeze create novel security challenges — prompt injection, data leakage through model outputs, adversarial attacks. My experience in [AI security / LLM security / adversarial ML] is rare and strategic. The RSU component should reflect this at $[target] over 4 years."

3. **Signing Bonus Lever — Security Clearance & Certification Value:** If you hold relevant certifications (CISSP, OSCP, CISM) or security clearances, negotiate a signing bonus reflecting this investment: "My [CISSP/OSCP/other] certifications represent $[X]K in personal investment and validate specialized expertise that HubSpot benefits from immediately. A signing bonus of $[amount] reflects this value alongside my forfeited equity of $[amount]."

4. **Operational Lever — Incident Response & On-Call Structure:** Security engineers carry critical on-call responsibilities. Negotiate explicit incident response compensation and rotation limits: "I'd like to formalize the security on-call structure, including compensation for off-hours incident response, maximum rotation frequency, and clear escalation policies. Specifically, I'm looking for [incident response pay / rotation caps / escalation SLAs]."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Security Engineers have exceptional leverage because the cost of a breach far exceeds comp costs. Frame every negotiation ask in terms of risk mitigation: "The cost of a single breach at HubSpot's scale is $[X]M+ in direct costs and incalculable in customer trust. My security expertise is a direct investment in risk reduction." The AI security angle is especially powerful — few security engineers have LLM/AI security experience, and Breeze AI makes this a critical need. Use competing offers from CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, or FAANG security teams to anchor market rate.
