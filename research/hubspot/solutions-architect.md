Solutions Architects at HubSpot bridge sales and engineering, designing technical solutions for enterprise customers across all six Hubs. They are responsible for technical discovery, architecture design, integration planning, and proof-of-concept delivery. SAs with experience in CRM migrations (from Salesforce, Dynamics, etc.), complex integrations, and Breeze AI implementation are at the top of the band. HubSpot's SA role carries both pre-sales and post-sales technical ownership.

#### Double-Trigger Acceleration Check

HubSpot M&A Protection — Double-Trigger Acceleration Check: HubSpot has been the subject of acquisition interest (Google was reportedly in talks). Before accepting, verify your RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration: if HubSpot is acquired AND you are terminated or role-changed within 12-24 months post-acquisition, 50-100% of your unvested RSUs accelerate immediately. Use this script: "Given the M&A environment for companies like HubSpot, I'd like to confirm my RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration provisions. Specifically, if HubSpot is acquired and my role is materially changed or eliminated within [12/18/24] months, I want [50/75/100]% of unvested RSUs to vest immediately." If HubSpot's standard agreement doesn't include this, negotiate it as a side letter — especially for senior roles.

#### Global Negotiation Levers

1. **Base Salary Lever — Enterprise Deal Influence Premium:** HubSpot is moving upmarket aggressively. SAs who can engage with enterprise-scale customers and architect multi-hub solutions carry direct revenue influence: "My experience architecting enterprise CRM solutions at [company] — supporting deals of $[X]M+ ACV — directly maps to HubSpot's upmarket motion. I'm targeting $[target] base to reflect the revenue-influencing nature of this role."

2. **Equity Lever — Customer Retention & Expansion Revenue:** SAs drive expansion revenue through technical trust and solution design. Frame RSU negotiation around NRR (Net Revenue Retention) impact: "Solutions Architects directly influence expansion revenue and net retention. My track record of [X]% NRR in my enterprise accounts and [Y] successful expansions justifies an RSU grant at $[target] over 4 years."

3. **Signing Bonus Lever — CRM Ecosystem Expertise Value:** If you bring deep Salesforce, Dynamics, or other CRM expertise that enables competitive displacement wins, negotiate a signing bonus reflecting this strategic value: "My [Salesforce/Dynamics/other CRM] expertise enables HubSpot to win competitive displacement deals from day one. A signing bonus of $[amount] reflects this immediate strategic value and bridges my forfeited equity of $[amount]."

4. **Variable Comp Lever — SA Bonus or Commission Structure:** Some SA roles at HubSpot carry deal-influence bonuses. Negotiate explicit variable comp tied to deal outcomes: "I'd like to discuss whether this SA role includes deal-influence bonuses or commission accelerators. Specifically, I'm looking for [X]% bonus tied to deals I technically qualify, with accelerators above [quota]."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Solutions Architects have unique leverage because they sit at the intersection of revenue and technology. Quantify your deal influence: total ACV of deals you have technically qualified, win rates, competitive displacement metrics. HubSpot's upmarket push means enterprise SA talent is scarce and valuable. If you bring Salesforce-to-HubSpot migration expertise, this is a premium skill worth 10-15% above band. Competing offers from Salesforce, ServiceNow, or Atlassian SA teams provide strong anchoring.
