Data Engineers at HubSpot build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers analytics, reporting, and AI features across all six Hubs. HubSpot's $2.6B+ ARR platform generates petabytes of CRM, marketing, sales, and service data. Data Engineers own data pipelines, data warehousing (likely Snowflake/Redshift), streaming infrastructure (Kafka), data quality, and the feature stores that feed Breeze AI's models. This role is foundational to HubSpot's AI strategy.

#### Double-Trigger Acceleration Check

HubSpot M&A Protection — Double-Trigger Acceleration Check: HubSpot has been the subject of acquisition interest (Google was reportedly in talks). Before accepting, verify your RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration: if HubSpot is acquired AND you are terminated or role-changed within 12-24 months post-acquisition, 50-100% of your unvested RSUs accelerate immediately. Use this script: "Given the M&A environment for companies like HubSpot, I'd like to confirm my RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration provisions. Specifically, if HubSpot is acquired and my role is materially changed or eliminated within [12/18/24] months, I want [50/75/100]% of unvested RSUs to vest immediately." If HubSpot's standard agreement doesn't include this, negotiate it as a side letter — especially for senior roles.

#### Global Negotiation Levers

1. **Base Salary Lever — Data Platform Scale Premium:** HubSpot's data infrastructure processes petabytes of multi-hub CRM data. Data Engineers who have operated at comparable scale command premium comp: "My experience building data pipelines at [company] — processing [X TB/PB daily, Y events/sec, Z tables] — maps directly to HubSpot's multi-hub data platform. I'm targeting $[target] base to reflect the scale and complexity of this data infrastructure role."

2. **Equity Lever — AI Feature Store & ML Pipeline Value:** Data Engineers who build the feature stores and ML pipelines powering Breeze AI create strategic infrastructure value. Push for premium RSU: "The data infrastructure I'll build — feature stores, ML training pipelines, real-time data feeds — directly powers Breeze AI's intelligence across all six Hubs. This AI-enabling infrastructure role justifies an RSU grant at $[target] over 4 years."

3. **Signing Bonus Lever — Tooling Expertise Premium:** If you bring deep expertise in HubSpot's likely data stack (Spark, Kafka, Airflow, Snowflake/Redshift, dbt), negotiate a signing bonus reflecting immediate productivity: "My expertise in [Spark/Kafka/Airflow/Snowflake/dbt] means I'll be productive in HubSpot's data stack from week one, without the typical 3-6 month ramp. A signing bonus of $[amount] reflects this immediate value and bridges my forfeited equity of $[amount]."

4. **Growth Lever — Data Platform Ownership Path:** Negotiate for ownership of strategic data platform areas and explicit career growth toward Staff/Principal: "I'd like to discuss ownership of [specific data platform area — real-time streaming, feature store, data quality framework]. This scope aligns with my trajectory toward Staff Data Engineer and should be reflected in the initial comp band positioning."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Data Engineers should emphasize their role as the foundation for HubSpot's AI strategy — without clean, reliable, well-structured data, Breeze AI cannot function. Frame every ask as an investment in AI infrastructure. Quantify your impact: pipeline throughput, data quality metrics, cost savings from optimization, time-to-insight improvements. Use competing offers from Databricks, Snowflake, Confluent, or FAANG data engineering teams. The strongest play is demonstrating experience building ML feature stores and real-time data systems that power AI products.
