#### Level Mapping

| HubSpot Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Technical Program Manager | TPM | 4-7 years |
| Senior TPM | Senior TPM | 7-10 years |
| Principal TPM | Principal TPM / Director | 10-15 years |

Technical Program Managers at HubSpot coordinate complex cross-team and cross-hub initiatives, including platform migrations, Breeze AI rollouts, infrastructure modernization, and major product launches. TPMs are expected to operate across engineering, product, design, and data teams with strong technical fluency. HubSpot's multi-hub architecture means TPMs regularly manage programs spanning 5-15 teams across multiple time zones (Cambridge, Dublin, London, remote).

#### Double-Trigger Acceleration Check

HubSpot M&A Protection — Double-Trigger Acceleration Check: HubSpot has been the subject of acquisition interest (Google was reportedly in talks). Before accepting, verify your RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration: if HubSpot is acquired AND you are terminated or role-changed within 12-24 months post-acquisition, 50-100% of your unvested RSUs accelerate immediately. Use this script: "Given the M&A environment for companies like HubSpot, I'd like to confirm my RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration provisions. Specifically, if HubSpot is acquired and my role is materially changed or eliminated within [12/18/24] months, I want [50/75/100]% of unvested RSUs to vest immediately." If HubSpot's standard agreement doesn't include this, negotiate it as a side letter — especially for senior roles.

#### Global Negotiation Levers

1. **Base Salary Lever — Cross-Hub Program Complexity Premium:** HubSpot's six-hub architecture creates inherently complex programs. TPMs managing cross-hub initiatives or Breeze AI rollouts should negotiate for top-of-band: "I'll be coordinating programs spanning [X] teams across [Y] hubs and [Z] time zones. My experience managing programs of comparable complexity at [company] — [specific program examples] — warrants $[target] base."

2. **Equity Lever — Strategic Program Delivery Impact:** TPMs who deliver critical programs on time directly impact HubSpot's revenue and market position. Frame RSU negotiation around program delivery value: "The programs I'll be managing — [Breeze AI rollout / platform migration / Hub integration] — have direct revenue and strategic impact. My track record of delivering [X] programs on time and within scope justifies an RSU grant at $[target] over 4 years."

3. **Signing Bonus Lever — Institutional Knowledge Investment:** TPMs require significant ramp time to build organizational relationships and understand cross-team dependencies. Negotiate a signing bonus that accounts for this: "TPM roles require 3-6 months to build the cross-organizational relationships needed for effectiveness. A signing bonus of $[amount] reflects this investment period and bridges my forfeited equity of $[amount]."

4. **Scope Lever — Breeze AI Program Portfolio:** Negotiate to own the highest-visibility programs from day one, particularly Breeze AI-related initiatives: "Given my background in [AI/ML program delivery / platform programs / cross-team orchestration], I'd like to discuss owning the Breeze AI [specific initiative] program portfolio. This scope alignment also supports positioning at the Senior TPM band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** TPMs should emphasize their ability to de-risk complex programs — quantify this with delivery track records, risk mitigation examples, and stakeholder management across distributed teams. HubSpot's global, remote-first model makes TPMs especially critical for coordination. The strongest play is demonstrating experience with AI/ML program delivery, as Breeze AI is HubSpot's highest-priority cross-cutting initiative. Use competing offers from Salesforce, Atlassian, Datadog, or FAANG TPM roles. TPMs are particularly vulnerable in M&A scenarios (coordination roles are often eliminated post-acquisition), making double-trigger acceleration especially important.
