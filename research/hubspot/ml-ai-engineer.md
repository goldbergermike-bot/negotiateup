### ML/AI Engineer | HubSpot Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Comp (Base + RSU + 10-15% Bonus) | +15-25% Agentic AI Premium | "Grow Better" Remote-First Culture | Breeze AI Copilot Integration | M&A Optionality

#### Compensation Benchmarks by Region

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| **Cambridge, MA (HQ)** | $172,000 - $215,000 | $192,000 - $322,000 | 10-15% | $232,000 - $308,000 |
| **Dublin, Ireland** | €103,000 - €140,000 | €106,000 - €193,000 | 10-15% | €139,000 - €200,000 |
| **London, UK** | £112,000 - £151,000 | £115,000 - £209,000 | 10-15% | £151,000 - £216,000 |

*Dublin: ~60-65% of US base, ~55-60% of US RSU. London: ~65-70% of US base, ~60-65% of US RSU.*

**Agentic AI Premium (+15-25%):** ML/AI Engineers with experience in agentic AI systems, autonomous agents, LLM-powered copilots, or multi-step reasoning frameworks command a 15-25% premium above standard bands. This premium reflects the extreme scarcity of engineers who can build production agentic AI systems — the core technology powering Breeze AI.

#### Level Mapping

| HubSpot Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| ML/AI Engineer | ML Engineer | 3-6 years |
| Senior ML/AI Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | 5-9 years |
| Staff ML/AI Engineer | Staff ML Engineer / ML Architect | 8-14 years |

ML/AI Engineers at HubSpot build the machine learning models and AI systems that power Breeze AI across all six Hubs. This includes recommendation engines, predictive lead scoring, natural language processing for customer interactions, content generation, workflow automation, and agentic AI capabilities. HubSpot's AI strategy is central to its competitive positioning against Salesforce Einstein and other CRM AI platforms. ML/AI Engineers work across the full ML lifecycle: research, prototyping, training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.

#### Double-Trigger Acceleration Check

HubSpot M&A Protection — Double-Trigger Acceleration Check: HubSpot has been the subject of acquisition interest (Google was reportedly in talks). Before accepting, verify your RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration: if HubSpot is acquired AND you are terminated or role-changed within 12-24 months post-acquisition, 50-100% of your unvested RSUs accelerate immediately. Use this script: "Given the M&A environment for companies like HubSpot, I'd like to confirm my RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration provisions. Specifically, if HubSpot is acquired and my role is materially changed or eliminated within [12/18/24] months, I want [50/75/100]% of unvested RSUs to vest immediately." If HubSpot's standard agreement doesn't include this, negotiate it as a side letter — especially for senior roles.

#### Global Negotiation Levers

1. **Base Salary Lever — Agentic AI Scarcity Premium:** Engineers who can build production agentic AI systems are among the scarcest talent in tech. If you have shipped agentic, multi-step reasoning, or LLM-powered copilot systems, demand the 15-25% premium: "I've shipped production agentic AI systems at [company] — specifically [agentic copilot / multi-step reasoning / autonomous workflow agent]. This is the exact technology powering Breeze AI. My base should reflect the agentic AI premium at $[target], which represents a [15-25]% premium over standard ML/AI Engineer bands."

2. **Equity Lever — Strategic AI IP Creation:** ML/AI Engineers at HubSpot create the core AI intellectual property that differentiates the platform. This strategic value justifies top-of-band RSU: "The AI models and systems I'll build at HubSpot represent strategic IP that directly impacts competitive positioning against Salesforce Einstein. My RSU grant should reflect this strategic value at $[target] over 4 years, with double-trigger acceleration given HubSpot's M&A profile."

3. **Signing Bonus Lever — AI Talent War Premium:** The market for ML/AI engineers with production agentic AI experience is intensely competitive. Use competing offers aggressively: "I have competing offers from [FAANG / AI labs / competing SaaS companies] ranging from $[X]-$[Y] in total comp. A signing bonus of $[amount] demonstrates HubSpot's commitment to winning AI talent and bridges my forfeited equity of $[amount]."

4. **Research & Compute Lever — GPU Budget & Publication Rights:** Negotiate dedicated GPU compute budget, conference attendance, and publication rights: "I'd like to discuss a dedicated annual compute budget of $[25K-75K] for model experimentation, guaranteed attendance at [NeurIPS/ICML/ACL/EMNLP], and the right to publish non-proprietary research findings. These investments directly improve Breeze AI's capabilities and HubSpot's AI brand."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** ML/AI Engineers are in the most competitive hiring market in tech. Your leverage is maximum — use it. Lead with the agentic AI premium: if you have built production agentic systems, copilots, or LLM-powered automation, you command 15-25% above standard ML bands. HubSpot needs this talent to compete with Salesforce Einstein, and Breeze AI is the company's most strategic initiative. Stack multiple competing offers from AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind), FAANG ML teams, and competing SaaS platforms (Salesforce, Datadog, Snowflake). Make double-trigger acceleration non-negotiable — if Google or another acquirer moves on HubSpot, your AI expertise is exactly what they're acquiring, but your role may be consolidated.
