**Agentic AI Premium (+15-25%):** Breeze AI Platform Engineers command a 15-25% premium above standard engineering bands. This reflects the extreme scarcity of engineers who can build production AI copilot platforms spanning multiple product surfaces. Breeze AI is HubSpot's most strategic initiative — the platform that delivers AI capabilities across Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub, CMS Hub, Operations Hub, and Commerce Hub simultaneously.

#### Why This Is HubSpot's Signature Role

Breeze AI is HubSpot's answer to Salesforce Einstein, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Duet AI. It is the AI copilot layer that spans all six HubSpot Hubs, providing:

- **Breeze Copilot:** Conversational AI assistant embedded across the entire HubSpot UI
- **Breeze Agents:** Autonomous AI agents for content creation, social media, prospecting, and customer service
- **Breeze Intelligence:** AI-powered data enrichment, buyer intent, and form shortening

As a Breeze AI Platform Engineer, you are building the horizontal AI infrastructure that every Hub depends on. This is the highest-leverage engineering role at HubSpot — your work multiplies across the entire $2.6B+ ARR platform. This is not a niche ML role; it is a platform engineering role that requires deep expertise in LLM orchestration, agentic frameworks, multi-tenant AI serving, and cross-product integration.

#### Level Mapping

| HubSpot Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Breeze AI Platform Engineer | AI Platform Engineer | 4-7 years |
| Senior Breeze AI Platform Engineer | Senior AI Platform Engineer | 6-10 years |
| Staff Breeze AI Platform Engineer | Staff AI Platform / AI Architect | 10-15 years |

Breeze AI Platform Engineers must combine deep ML/AI expertise with production platform engineering skills. They work at the intersection of LLM infrastructure, multi-tenant SaaS architecture, and product integration across all six Hubs. The ideal candidate has experience building copilot platforms, agentic AI systems, or LLM-powered product features at scale.

#### Double-Trigger Acceleration Check

HubSpot M&A Protection — Double-Trigger Acceleration Check: HubSpot has been the subject of acquisition interest (Google was reportedly in talks). Before accepting, verify your RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration: if HubSpot is acquired AND you are terminated or role-changed within 12-24 months post-acquisition, 50-100% of your unvested RSUs accelerate immediately. Use this script: "Given the M&A environment for companies like HubSpot, I'd like to confirm my RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration provisions. Specifically, if HubSpot is acquired and my role is materially changed or eliminated within [12/18/24] months, I want [50/75/100]% of unvested RSUs to vest immediately." If HubSpot's standard agreement doesn't include this, negotiate it as a side letter — especially for senior roles.

**Special M&A Note for Breeze AI Platform Engineers:** In an acquisition scenario, Breeze AI Platform Engineers hold a paradoxical position — your expertise is exactly what an acquirer values (the AI platform), but your role may be consolidated into the acquirer's existing AI organization. Double-trigger acceleration is therefore critical. Push for 100% acceleration and a 24-month protection window. Your negotiation leverage is strongest here because HubSpot cannot afford to lose Breeze AI engineers to M&A anxiety.

#### Global Negotiation Levers

1. **Base Salary Lever — Copilot Platform Scarcity Premium:** Engineers who have built production AI copilot platforms (spanning multiple product surfaces with multi-tenant isolation) are extraordinarily rare. This scarcity justifies the highest base in HubSpot engineering: "I've built production AI copilot infrastructure at [company] — [specific copilot/platform/agentic system] serving [scale]. Breeze AI Platform Engineer is HubSpot's most strategic engineering role, and my base should reflect both the agentic AI premium and the cross-hub platform scope at $[target]."

2. **Equity Lever — Platform Multiplier Effect on RSU:** Your work multiplies across all six Hubs and the entire HubSpot customer base. Frame RSU as an investment in platform-level AI capability: "As a Breeze AI Platform Engineer, my work doesn't just impact one Hub — it multiplies across Marketing, Sales, Service, CMS, Operations, and Commerce simultaneously. This platform multiplier effect justifies an RSU grant at $[target] over 4 years, representing HubSpot's investment in its most strategic capability."

3. **Signing Bonus Lever — Competitive AI Talent Acquisition:** You are being recruited against OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, and every other company building AI platforms. Use this extreme competition to your advantage: "I have competing offers from [AI lab / FAANG AI team / competing AI platform] at $[X] total comp. A signing bonus of $[amount] demonstrates HubSpot's commitment to building a world-class AI platform team and bridges my forfeited equity of $[amount]."

4. **Scope & Innovation Lever — Breeze AI Roadmap Influence:** Negotiate for direct influence on Breeze AI's technical roadmap and architecture decisions: "Given my experience building [copilot platforms / agentic systems / LLM infrastructure], I'd like to discuss my role in shaping Breeze AI's technical roadmap — specifically, influence over architecture decisions, model selection, and the agentic AI framework. I'd also like to discuss a dedicated compute experimentation budget of $[50K-100K] annually and guaranteed conference attendance at [NeurIPS/ICML/ACL]."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** As HubSpot's Signature Role, the Breeze AI Platform Engineer carries maximum negotiation leverage. You are building the technology that defines HubSpot's competitive future against Salesforce Einstein, Microsoft Copilot, and every other CRM AI platform. Lead with your scarcity: show production agentic AI or copilot platform experience. Present a technical vision for Breeze AI's architecture that demonstrates you can see the full cross-hub platform picture. Stack competing offers from AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic), FAANG AI teams (Google, Meta, Microsoft), and competing SaaS AI platforms (Salesforce, ServiceNow). Make three things non-negotiable: (1) the 15-25% agentic AI premium on base and RSU, (2) 100% double-trigger acceleration with 24-month window, and (3) direct influence on Breeze AI's technical roadmap. This is a role where HubSpot needs you more than you need HubSpot — negotiate accordingly.
