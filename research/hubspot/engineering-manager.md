#### Level Mapping

| HubSpot Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | 8-12 years (3+ managing) |
| Senior Engineering Manager | Senior EM / Director | 10-15 years (5+ managing) |
| Director of Engineering | Director | 12-18 years (7+ managing) |

Engineering Managers at HubSpot own a team of 6-12 engineers within a Hub, driving both people development and technical delivery. HubSpot's "Grow Better" culture means EMs are measured on team health metrics (employee NPS, retention) alongside shipping velocity. Cross-hub EMs managing Breeze AI integration teams sit at the top of the band.

#### Double-Trigger Acceleration Check

HubSpot M&A Protection — Double-Trigger Acceleration Check: HubSpot has been the subject of acquisition interest (Google was reportedly in talks). Before accepting, verify your RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration: if HubSpot is acquired AND you are terminated or role-changed within 12-24 months post-acquisition, 50-100% of your unvested RSUs accelerate immediately. Use this script: "Given the M&A environment for companies like HubSpot, I'd like to confirm my RSU agreement includes double-trigger acceleration provisions. Specifically, if HubSpot is acquired and my role is materially changed or eliminated within [12/18/24] months, I want [50/75/100]% of unvested RSUs to vest immediately." If HubSpot's standard agreement doesn't include this, negotiate it as a side letter — especially for senior roles.

#### Global Negotiation Levers

1. **Base Salary Lever — Team Scale & Hub Complexity Premium:** EM comp scales with team size and hub complexity. If you are managing teams across multiple hubs or managing Breeze AI integration squads, push for top-of-band: "I'll be managing [X] engineers across [hub/hubs] with direct ownership of [feature/platform area]. This cross-hub scope warrants $[target] base, aligned with HubSpot's Senior EM band rather than the EM midpoint."

2. **Equity Lever — Retention & Leadership RSU Grant:** EM roles carry significant retention risk — HubSpot needs strong people leaders. Use this to negotiate above-midpoint RSU: "Engineering Managers with my profile — [team-building track record, retention metrics, shipping velocity] — are in high demand. I'd like the RSU grant at $[target] to reflect both the role's retention-critical nature and my leadership track record."

3. **Signing Bonus Lever — Management Transition Premium:** Transitioning into EM at a new company carries unique risk (new team, new culture, new systems). Negotiate a signing bonus that de-risks the move: "Joining as an EM requires a longer ramp to full effectiveness than an IC role. A signing bonus of $[amount] reflects the transition complexity and my forfeited equity of $[amount] at my current employer."

4. **Scope Lever — Director Path & Headcount Commitment:** Negotiate explicit growth commitments: headcount additions, budget ownership, and promotion timeline to Senior EM or Director: "I'd like to discuss the growth trajectory for this role — specifically, what the headcount plan looks like over 12-18 months, whether I'll have budget ownership, and what the Senior EM or Director promotion criteria and timeline are."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Engineering Managers have unique leverage at HubSpot because the company's "Grow Better" culture places extraordinary emphasis on people leadership. Come armed with your team health metrics: retention rates, employee NPS scores, promotion rates of direct reports, and diversity hiring outcomes. Frame your value in terms HubSpot cares about most. For M&A protection, EMs are among the most vulnerable in an acquisition — management layers are typically the first to be restructured. Make double-trigger acceleration non-negotiable.
