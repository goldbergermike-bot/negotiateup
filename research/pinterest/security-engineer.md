### Security Engineer | Pinterest Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + Equity + Bonus | Visual Discovery & Social Commerce | Shopping Assistant AI (Sept 2026) | Commerce Security & Data Privacy Premium | Standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $175K–$218K | $150K–$275K | 10–15% | $218K–$298K |
| New York | $168K–$210K | $142K–$260K | 10–15% | $208K–$285K |
| Remote US | $155K–$195K | $125K–$235K | 10–15% | $192K–$262K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Pinterest protect a platform handling the personal data, visual content, and increasingly the financial transactions of 500M+ monthly active users. Pinterest's security surface is uniquely complex — it spans user data privacy across global jurisdictions, image content moderation at scale, advertiser data protection, and now, with the commerce transformation, payment processing security, merchant data isolation, and PCI-DSS compliance for checkout transactions. The September 2026 AI Shopping Assistant launch exponentially expands Pinterest's security requirements: conversational AI introduces new attack vectors (prompt injection, data exfiltration through AI responses), commerce transactions require end-to-end payment security, and the AI system itself must be secured against adversarial manipulation of product recommendations.

**Shopping Assistant — Critical Project Sign-On**

Pinterest is racing to launch its AI Shopping Assistant by September 2026 — a visual AI that lets users shop directly from Pins using conversational AI, image recognition, and personalized product recommendations. "As a Security Engineer, you will define and implement the security architecture for the Shopping Assistant — securing the conversational AI against prompt injection and data leakage, building the payment security layer for in-platform checkout, ensuring PCI-DSS compliance for commerce transactions, and protecting the recommendation system against adversarial manipulation. Security cannot be bolted on after launch — it must be designed in from the first line of code. A Critical Project sign-on bonus of $25K–$45K reflects the urgency of embedding security into the Shopping Assistant's architecture before it's too expensive to retrofit." Push for $25K–$45K Critical Project sign-ons.

**Global Levers**

1. **Shopping Assistant Deadline — Sept 2026:** "Security debt is the most expensive kind of technical debt. If the Shopping Assistant's security architecture isn't designed before features start shipping, Pinterest will either launch with security gaps — risking user data and regulatory penalties — or delay the launch to retrofit security. My early start ensures security is built in, not bolted on."
2. **Visual Discovery Monetization:** "Pinterest's monetization through commerce requires user trust — users will only enter payment information, share shopping preferences, and complete purchases if they trust the platform. A security breach in the Shopping Assistant wouldn't just cost money — it would destroy the trust that Pinterest's entire commerce strategy depends on."
3. **500M+ MAU Social Commerce:** "Securing commerce transactions for 500M+ users across global jurisdictions — GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS, SOX — requires deep expertise in both platform security and regulatory compliance. The Shopping Assistant introduces payment data, merchant integrations, and AI-processed personal preferences, all of which require security engineering at the highest level."
4. **Security Engineers with AI + Commerce Expertise are Exceptionally Rare:** "The intersection of AI security (prompt injection, adversarial ML, data exfiltration via AI), commerce security (PCI-DSS, payment processing), and platform security (500M+ user data protection) is one of the most specialized talent pools in tech. Companies from Google to OpenAI to Stripe are competing for this exact profile. Pinterest's offer must reflect this scarcity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $210K base and $255K RSUs over 4 years, plus a Critical Project sign-on of $40K, for this Security Engineer position. The Shopping Assistant launch in September 2026 introduces AI security risks, payment processing requirements, and expanded data privacy obligations — I've secured AI-powered commerce platforms at [company] and I bring direct experience in the exact threat landscape Pinterest is entering. I have competing offers from Stripe at $295K TC and Google at $290K TC." Accept at $195K+ base and $220K+ RSUs.
