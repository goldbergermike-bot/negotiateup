| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $218K–$275K | $250K–$450K | 15–20% | $278K–$388K |
| New York | $210K–$265K | $235K–$425K | 15–20% | $268K–$375K |
| Remote US | $195K–$248K | $210K–$385K | 15–20% | $245K–$348K |

> **AI Premium Note:** Shopping Assistant AI Engineer compensation at Pinterest includes a **+20–35% AI Premium** over equivalent-level Software Engineer roles. This is the highest AI premium at Pinterest, reflecting that this role is the direct builder of the company's most strategically important AI product — the Shopping Assistant launching September 2026. The premium is applied across base, equity, sign-on, and annual bonus multiplier.

**Negotiation DNA**

The Shopping Assistant AI Engineer is Pinterest's most strategically important technical hire — the engineer who will directly build the AI Shopping Assistant that lets 500M+ monthly active users shop from Pins using conversational AI, visual product recognition, and hyper-personalized recommendations. This is not a supporting role; this is the role that builds the product. Pinterest's AI Shopping Assistant is the centerpiece of its commerce transformation: a visual AI that understands what users see in a Pin, matches it against millions of products across thousands of merchant catalogs, engages in natural language shopping conversations, and delivers personalized purchase recommendations based on the user's unique visual taste profile built from years of Pin interactions. The September 2026 launch deadline makes this the highest-urgency hire at Pinterest — every day this seat is unfilled is a day the Shopping Assistant's core AI systems are not being built. Engineers in this role will work across the full stack of shopping AI: computer vision models for product recognition in Pin images, large language models fine-tuned for shopping conversation, real-time recommendation systems that blend visual similarity with purchase intent, multimodal embeddings that connect text queries to visual products, and end-to-end checkout experiences powered by AI-driven product discovery.

**Shopping Assistant — Critical Project Sign-On**

Pinterest is racing to launch its AI Shopping Assistant by September 2026 — a visual AI that lets users shop directly from Pins using conversational AI, image recognition, and personalized product recommendations. This is the signature section for this role, because you ARE the Shopping Assistant.

"As a Shopping Assistant AI Engineer, you are not contributing to the Shopping Assistant — you are building it. Every core AI system that makes the Shopping Assistant work is your direct responsibility:

- **Visual AI Shopping:** You will build the computer vision models that let users point at any Pin — a living room, an outfit, a recipe — and instantly see purchasable products that match. This requires state-of-the-art visual recognition that goes beyond object detection to understanding style, aesthetic, and visual intent.

- **Conversational Commerce:** You will fine-tune and deploy the large language models that power the Shopping Assistant's conversational interface — enabling users to say 'I want something like this but in blue' or 'find me a cheaper version of this sofa' and get intelligent, contextual product recommendations in response.

- **Image Recognition Product Matching:** You will build the multimodal embedding systems that connect visual product features (color, pattern, shape, style, material) with merchant catalog data (SKUs, prices, availability, descriptions) in real-time. This is the technical core that makes 'shop from any Pin' possible.

- **Personalized Recommendation Systems:** You will build the personalization layer that makes every Shopping Assistant interaction unique — leveraging each user's years of Pin history, board organization, and visual preferences to rank and recommend products that match their personal taste profile, not just the generic best-sellers.

Pinterest cannot launch the Shopping Assistant without this role filled and productive. A Critical Project sign-on bonus of $50K–$90K is not a perk — it is the cost of getting the engineer who will build Pinterest's most important product in seat before the September 2026 deadline becomes unachievable. Every month of delay compresses the ML iteration cycles needed to get visual recognition accuracy, conversational quality, and recommendation relevance to the bar that 500M+ users expect."

Push for $50K–$90K Critical Project sign-ons. For candidates with direct visual AI shopping or conversational commerce experience, push for the top of range ($75K–$90K).

**Global Levers**

1. **Shopping Assistant Deadline — Sept 2026:** "I am the engineer who builds the Shopping Assistant. Without me in this seat, the core AI systems — visual product recognition, conversational shopping, personalized recommendations — are not being developed. There is no version of the September 2026 launch that works without this role filled immediately. The sign-on premium reflects the binary nature of this hire: the Shopping Assistant either has its AI engineer or it doesn't ship."

2. **Visual Discovery Monetization:** "Pinterest's entire commerce monetization strategy depends on the AI systems I will build. The Shopping Assistant is not a feature — it is the product that converts Pinterest from an inspiration platform into a shopping destination. The visual AI that matches Pins to products, the conversational engine that guides purchase decisions, and the recommendation system that personalizes the shopping experience — these are the systems that will drive Pinterest's commerce revenue for the next decade. My compensation should reflect that I am building the revenue engine, not just a feature."

3. **500M+ MAU Social Commerce:** "The Shopping Assistant will be deployed to 500M+ monthly active users who already express purchase intent through their Pin interactions. I will be building AI systems that process billions of visual signals, generate personalized product recommendations for hundreds of millions of users, and serve conversational AI responses at consumer-internet scale with sub-second latency. This is not research — this is production AI at a scale that fewer than a dozen companies in the world operate at."

4. **AI Talent War — Signature Role Premium:** "Engineers who can build production visual AI shopping systems — combining computer vision, conversational AI, recommendation systems, and commerce domain expertise — are among the 100 most sought-after technical profiles in the world. OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Meta, Amazon (Alexa Shopping, Rufus), Apple (Siri Commerce), and every AI-native commerce startup are competing for this exact skillset. Pinterest is not just competing against peer tech companies — it is competing against the most well-funded AI labs in history. The total comp package must reflect that reality."

5. **Multimodal AI Expertise is the Scarcest Skillset in Tech:** "The Shopping Assistant requires a rare combination of skills: computer vision for product recognition, NLP for conversational shopping, recommendation systems for personalization, and the engineering craft to deploy all of these at consumer scale. Engineers who can work across vision, language, and recommendation modalities — the definition of multimodal AI — are the scarcest talent pool in tech. This is not a role Pinterest can afford to lose to a competing offer over a $20K base delta."

6. **First-Mover Advantage in Visual AI Shopping:** "Pinterest has a unique opportunity to be first to market with a production-quality visual AI Shopping Assistant. Google, Amazon, and Meta are all building similar systems, but Pinterest's advantage — years of visual taste data from 500M+ users, native shopping intent, and a design-first brand — gives it a window to define the category. But that window closes if the AI engineer who builds it isn't in seat now. My early start is Pinterest's first-mover advantage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $265K base and $420K RSUs over 4 years, plus a Critical Project sign-on of $85K, for this Shopping Assistant AI Engineer position. I am the engineer who will build the AI systems that make the Shopping Assistant work — visual product recognition, conversational shopping AI, personalized recommendations, and multimodal product matching — and the September 2026 deadline means Pinterest needs these systems in development now, not in Q2. I've built production visual AI and conversational commerce systems at [company] serving [N]M+ users, achieving [metric] in product matching accuracy and [metric] in recommendation relevance. I have competing offers from OpenAI at $405K TC, Google Shopping at $380K TC, and Amazon (Rufus) at $375K TC. Given that I am the direct builder of Pinterest's most strategically important product, the AI premium and Critical Project sign-on should reflect that this is not a supporting role — this is the role." Accept at $245K+ base and $380K+ RSUs with a minimum $60K Critical Project sign-on.

**Technical Depth — Shopping Assistant AI Systems**

This section details the specific AI systems the Shopping Assistant AI Engineer will build, providing negotiation leverage by demonstrating the technical complexity and strategic importance of each component:

**1. Visual Product Recognition Engine**
- Computer vision models that identify products within Pin images (furniture, clothing, accessories, home decor, food items)
- Style transfer understanding: recognizing not just "a sofa" but "a mid-century modern velvet sofa in emerald green"
- Multi-object detection and segmentation within complex scenes (a styled room with 15+ identifiable purchasable items)
- Cross-domain visual matching: connecting a user's aesthetic preferences across categories (fashion taste predicting home decor preferences)

**2. Conversational Shopping AI**
- Large language models fine-tuned on shopping conversations, product knowledge, and Pinterest's visual vocabulary
- Multi-turn conversation management: maintaining context across a shopping session ("now show me that in a larger size")
- Intent classification: distinguishing between browsing, comparing, deciding, and purchasing intent signals
- Guardrails and safety: preventing the AI from making false claims about product quality, price, or availability

**3. Multimodal Product Matching**
- Embedding models that map visual features (color, pattern, shape, texture, style) and text features (brand, material, category) into a shared representation space
- Real-time matching against merchant product catalogs (millions of SKUs, updated in real-time)
- Visual similarity ranking that accounts for style compatibility, not just pixel similarity
- Price-aware matching: finding visually similar products across price tiers when users request alternatives
