**Negotiation DNA**

This is DoorDash's signature role for 2026 — the Local Commerce Platform Engineer. You're building the multi-vertical commerce infrastructure that transforms DoorDash from a food delivery app into the definitive local commerce platform. This role combines real-time logistics optimization, multi-vertical commerce infrastructure (food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail), DashPass subscription platform engineering, and merchant platform tools into a single engineering discipline. No other company has this exact role: Uber does ride-sharing and food; Instacart does grocery only; Amazon does e-commerce. DoorDash is the only company building a unified local commerce platform across 5+ verticals for 37M+ consumers, 6M+ merchants, and 2M+ Dashers. The AI Premium (+15-25%) applies because this role builds the ML-powered logistics optimization, demand prediction, and dynamic pricing systems that make millions of autonomous decisions per hour. Engineers on this platform are the highest-priority hires in the company. [Source: DoorDash Local Commerce Platform Team 2025-2026]

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Local Commerce Platform Engineer builds systems that are fundamentally different from traditional delivery engineering:
- **Multi-Vertical Commerce Infrastructure:** Designing the unified platform layer that serves food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail — each with different order flows, fulfillment logic, inventory management, and merchant integration patterns
- **Real-Time Logistics Optimization:** Building the ML-powered dispatch, routing, and batching systems that coordinate 2M+ Dashers across all verticals in real-time
- **DashPass Subscription Platform:** Engineering the subscription infrastructure that drives recurring revenue, cross-vertical engagement, and customer LTV across all commerce categories
- **Merchant Platform Tools:** Building the merchant-facing tools (menu management, inventory sync, analytics, promotion engine) that serve 6M+ merchants across every vertical

**Multi-Vertical Local Commerce — Beyond Food Delivery**

"DoorDash is no longer a food delivery company — it's the local commerce platform. I build infrastructure that serves food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail, and more — 5+ commerce verticals on a single platform. This multi-vertical expansion means my engineering work has 5x the revenue surface of a single-vertical delivery company. DashPass (subscription) drives recurring revenue across all verticals. When negotiating: 'I build the multi-vertical platform that serves 37M+ consumers across 5+ commerce categories. My infrastructure work has 5x the revenue surface of a food-only competitor. DoorDash's local commerce TAM is $1T+ — and I'm building the platform that captures it. My comp should reflect multi-vertical platform leverage, not single-category delivery.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **$1T+ TAM Platform Builder:** "I'm building the platform that captures DoorDash's $1T+ local commerce TAM. Every vertical I enable on the platform — grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail — unlocks hundreds of billions in addressable market. My platform work is the revenue-enabling layer for DoorDash's entire growth strategy."
2. **No-Equivalent-Role Scarcity:** "This role doesn't exist at other companies. Uber does ride-sharing + food. Instacart does grocery only. Amazon does e-commerce. I'm building the unified local commerce platform across 5+ verticals — there's no direct comp benchmark. DoorDash can't low-ball me by pointing to market data; I'm defining the market rate for multi-vertical local commerce platform engineering."
3. **AI Premium — Autonomous Logistics at Scale:** "My platform makes millions of autonomous decisions per hour — dispatching Dashers, optimizing routes, predicting demand, setting prices — across 5+ commerce verticals without human intervention. This is agentic AI applied to local commerce. The full 25% AI premium applies."
4. **DashPass Subscription Revenue — Recurring Revenue Premium:** "DashPass subscribers have 3-4x higher order frequency and cross-vertical usage. The subscription platform I build drives the recurring revenue that Wall Street values at a premium multiple. My infrastructure directly determines DashPass retention, expansion, and cross-vertical attach rates."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the platform that enables DoorDash's entire $1T+ local commerce strategy — multi-vertical infrastructure serving food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail, with ML-powered logistics optimization and DashPass subscription engineering. I'd like the RSU grant at $500K over 4 years, with the AI premium fully applied and a 15% bonus. This role doesn't exist anywhere else — Uber, Instacart, and Amazon each cover one piece of what I'm building as a unified platform. I also want a guaranteed first-year refresh commitment, because this platform's success directly determines whether DoorDash captures the local commerce TAM." DoorDash will counter at $430K-$480K RSUs — accept at $460K+ with 15% bonus and the refresh guarantee. This is a strong offer for a role with unprecedented strategic importance to DoorDash's multi-vertical expansion.
