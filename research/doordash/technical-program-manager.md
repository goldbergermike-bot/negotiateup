### Technical Program Manager | DoorDash Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base + Bonus | Local Commerce Leader | Multi-Vertical Expansion

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $175K–$218K | $148K–$258K | 10% | $213K–$288K |
| New York City | $175K–$218K | $148K–$258K | 10% | $213K–$288K |
| Sydney | A$144K–A$180K | A$97K–A$168K | 10% | A$174K–A$234K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at DoorDash coordinate the most complex cross-functional programs in local commerce — multi-vertical expansion (launching grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail on the same platform), Wolt integration (merging European operations), DashPass subscription programs, and marketplace infrastructure upgrades that touch all three sides of the platform (consumer, merchant, Dasher). In 2026, TPM scope at DoorDash is uniquely broad: every program spans 5+ commerce verticals, requires coordination with the Wolt engineering org across 20+ European countries, and must maintain real-time system reliability during launches. DoorDash TPMs are the connective tissue between product, engineering, data science, and operations — owning the delivery timeline for programs that directly impact $60B+ in gross order value. The comp model includes 10% bonus, equity-heavy RSUs on a 4-year/1-year cliff vest, and competitive base. [Source: DoorDash TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Multi-Vertical Local Commerce — Beyond Food Delivery**

"DoorDash is no longer a food delivery company — it's the local commerce platform. I build infrastructure that serves food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail, and more — 5+ commerce verticals on a single platform. This multi-vertical expansion means my engineering work has 5x the revenue surface of a single-vertical delivery company. DashPass (subscription) drives recurring revenue across all verticals. When negotiating: 'I build the multi-vertical platform that serves 37M+ consumers across 5+ commerce categories. My infrastructure work has 5x the revenue surface of a food-only competitor. DoorDash's local commerce TAM is $1T+ — and I'm building the platform that captures it. My comp should reflect multi-vertical platform leverage, not single-category delivery.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Vertical Program Coordination:** "I coordinate programs that span food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail — 5+ verticals with different launch requirements, merchant types, regulatory needs, and fulfillment workflows. Each program I deliver unlocks a new vertical for 37M+ consumers."
2. **Wolt Integration Program:** "I'm driving the Wolt integration — merging DoorDash's US platform with Wolt's European operations across 20+ countries. This is a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar integration program with cross-timezone, cross-org coordination."
3. **DashPass Subscription Programs:** "I manage programs that expand DashPass across all verticals — a subscription product that drives recurring revenue and 3-4x higher order frequency. My program delivery directly impacts DashPass subscriber growth and retention."
4. **Competing TPM Offers — Uber/Amazon/FAANG:** Bring competing offers: "Amazon L5 TPM is offering $250K RSUs. DoorDash's multi-vertical, international program scope (Wolt integration alone) exceeds the complexity of most FAANG TPM roles, and the equity should reflect that."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a TPM role coordinating multi-vertical expansion across 5+ commerce categories, driving the Wolt European integration, and managing DashPass subscription programs — I'm targeting $245K in RSUs over 4 years with a 10% bonus. I have an Amazon L5 TPM offer at $248K RSUs and an Uber TPM offer. DoorDash's program scope — multi-vertical, international, three-sided marketplace — is the most complex TPM mandate in local commerce, and the equity should reflect that." DoorDash will counter at $210K-$240K RSUs — accept at $225K+ with 10% bonus confirmed.
