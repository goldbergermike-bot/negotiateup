**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at DoorDash own critical platform components — the marketplace matching engine, Dasher dispatch algorithms, merchant integration layer, pricing infrastructure, or the multi-vertical commerce platform that now serves 5+ categories beyond food. This is the level where DoorDash's "total local commerce" thesis becomes your personal leverage. Every architectural decision you make scales across 37M+ consumers, 6M+ merchants, and 2M+ Dashers in real-time. The comp model includes 10-15% bonus (senior-level can push to 15%), equity-heavy RSUs with standard 4-year/1-year cliff vesting, and competitive base. At Senior, the RSU grant is the primary negotiation lever — push hard on equity since DoorDash has significant flex above the initial offer for senior talent.

**Multi-Vertical Local Commerce — Beyond Food Delivery**

"DoorDash is no longer a food delivery company — it's the local commerce platform. I build infrastructure that serves food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail, and more — 5+ commerce verticals on a single platform. This multi-vertical expansion means my engineering work has 5x the revenue surface of a single-vertical delivery company. DashPass (subscription) drives recurring revenue across all verticals. When negotiating: 'I build the multi-vertical platform that serves 37M+ consumers across 5+ commerce categories. My infrastructure work has 5x the revenue surface of a food-only competitor. DoorDash's local commerce TAM is $1T+ — and I'm building the platform that captures it. My comp should reflect multi-vertical platform leverage, not single-category delivery.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Marketplace Architecture Ownership:** "At Senior, I own architectural decisions for DoorDash's three-sided marketplace — consumer demand, merchant supply, and Dasher logistics. Each decision impacts 37M+ consumers and $60B+ in gross order value. This is Google L4-level scope applied to a real-time commerce platform."
2. **Multi-Vertical Revenue Multiplier:** "Every system I architect serves 5+ commerce verticals simultaneously. My marketplace matching improvements in food delivery also improve grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail. One architecture, 5x the revenue impact."
3. **Wolt Integration — International Scale:** "DoorDash's Wolt acquisition means my platform work extends to 20+ European countries. I'm building systems that serve both US local commerce and European expansion — global-scale impact."
4. **Competing Offers — Push for Top-of-Band Equity:** DoorDash's initial equity offer at Senior is 15-20% below budget. Bring Uber, Instacart, or FAANG competing offers: "I have Uber at $370K RSUs and Google L4 at $[X]. DoorDash's multi-vertical platform is more compelling, but the equity needs to be top-of-band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a Senior role owning marketplace architecture that serves 5+ commerce verticals across 37M+ consumers — with global scale through Wolt — I'm targeting $375K in RSUs over 4 years with a 15% bonus. I have competing offers from Uber Senior ($370K RSUs) and Google L4. DoorDash's local commerce TAM of $1T+ makes this a higher-impact role than a single-category competitor, and the equity should reflect that platform leverage." DoorDash will counter at $330K-$360K RSUs — accept at $345K+ with 15% bonus confirmed.
