### Security Engineer | DoorDash Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base + Bonus | Local Commerce Leader | Multi-Vertical Expansion

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $198K–$248K | $198K–$345K | 10% | $247K–$335K |
| New York City | $198K–$248K | $198K–$345K | 10% | $247K–$335K |
| Sydney | A$163K–A$204K | A$129K–A$225K | 10% | A$202K–A$272K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at DoorDash protect a platform that processes billions of dollars in payments, manages identity verification for 2M+ Dashers, handles PII for 37M+ consumers and 6M+ merchants, and must comply with regulations across the US and 20+ European countries (via Wolt). In 2026, the multi-vertical expansion into grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail adds vertical-specific security requirements — alcohol requires age verification, pharmacy (future) requires HIPAA-adjacent compliance, and retail requires different fraud patterns than food delivery. DoorDash's three-sided marketplace creates a unique attack surface: consumer payment fraud, merchant account takeover, and Dasher identity fraud are three distinct threat vectors, each requiring dedicated security architecture. The comp model includes 10% bonus, equity-heavy RSUs on a 4-year/1-year cliff vest, and competitive base. Security talent is scarce — DoorDash will stretch significantly for strong candidates.

**Multi-Vertical Local Commerce — Beyond Food Delivery**

"DoorDash is no longer a food delivery company — it's the local commerce platform. I build infrastructure that serves food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail, and more — 5+ commerce verticals on a single platform. This multi-vertical expansion means my engineering work has 5x the revenue surface of a single-vertical delivery company. DashPass (subscription) drives recurring revenue across all verticals. When negotiating: 'I build the multi-vertical platform that serves 37M+ consumers across 5+ commerce categories. My infrastructure work has 5x the revenue surface of a food-only competitor. DoorDash's local commerce TAM is $1T+ — and I'm building the platform that captures it. My comp should reflect multi-vertical platform leverage, not single-category delivery.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Three-Sided Attack Surface:** "I protect a three-sided marketplace — consumer payment fraud, merchant account takeover, and Dasher identity fraud are three distinct threat vectors. Most security roles protect one user type. I protect three, each with different attack patterns and risk profiles."
2. **Multi-Vertical Compliance Complexity:** "Each commerce vertical adds security requirements — alcohol needs age verification, grocery needs cold-chain data protection, retail needs different fraud models, and Wolt's European operations need GDPR compliance. I manage security across 5+ regulatory frameworks."
3. **Payment Security at Scale:** "DoorDash processes billions in payments annually across 37M+ consumers. Payment fraud prevention directly protects revenue — every dollar of fraud I prevent is a dollar of margin. My security work is directly revenue-protective."
4. **Competing Security Offers — Stripe/FAANG:** Security talent is scarce. Bring competing offers: "Stripe is offering $330K RSUs for a payment security role. DoorDash's three-sided marketplace creates a broader attack surface than Stripe's merchant-only model, and the equity should reflect that expanded security mandate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a Security Engineer role protecting a three-sided marketplace — consumer payments, merchant accounts, Dasher identity — across 5+ commerce verticals with GDPR/international compliance through Wolt — I'm targeting $330K in RSUs over 4 years with a 10% bonus. I have a Stripe security offer at $325K RSUs. DoorDash's three-sided attack surface and multi-vertical compliance requirements are broader than a payment-only security role, and the equity should reflect that." DoorDash will counter at $280K-$320K RSUs — accept at $300K+ with 10% bonus confirmed.
