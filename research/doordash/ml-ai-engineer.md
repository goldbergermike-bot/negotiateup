### ML/AI Engineer | DoorDash Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base + Bonus | Local Commerce Leader | Multi-Vertical Expansion | **+15–25% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $215K–$268K | $262K–$458K | 15% | $281K–$385K |
| New York City | $215K–$268K | $262K–$458K | 15% | $281K–$385K |
| Sydney | A$177K–A$221K | A$171K–A$298K | 15% | A$230K–A$315K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at DoorDash build the intelligence layer that powers the most complex local commerce marketplace in the US — delivery route optimization, demand prediction, dynamic pricing, ETA estimation, Dasher-order matching, and fraud detection across 37M+ consumers, 6M+ merchants, and 2M+ Dashers. In 2026, DoorDash's multi-vertical expansion means every ML model must serve 5+ commerce categories (food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail) — each with different demand patterns, delivery constraints, and pricing dynamics. The +15-25% AI Premium applies because DoorDash's ML systems make millions of autonomous real-time decisions per hour — dispatching Dashers, setting prices, predicting demand — without human intervention. DoorDash's proprietary dataset (billions of real-time orders, GPS traces, demand signals across 5+ verticals) is an ML training moat that no competitor can replicate. The comp model includes 15% bonus at ML level, equity-heavy RSUs, and competitive base. [Source: DoorDash ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Multi-Vertical Local Commerce — Beyond Food Delivery**

"DoorDash is no longer a food delivery company — it's the local commerce platform. I build infrastructure that serves food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail, and more — 5+ commerce verticals on a single platform. This multi-vertical expansion means my engineering work has 5x the revenue surface of a single-vertical delivery company. DashPass (subscription) drives recurring revenue across all verticals. When negotiating: 'I build the multi-vertical platform that serves 37M+ consumers across 5+ commerce categories. My infrastructure work has 5x the revenue surface of a food-only competitor. DoorDash's local commerce TAM is $1T+ — and I'm building the platform that captures it. My comp should reflect multi-vertical platform leverage, not single-category delivery.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Autonomous Real-Time Decision Systems:** "My ML models make millions of autonomous decisions per hour — dispatching Dashers, setting dynamic prices, predicting demand, estimating ETAs — all without human intervention. This is agentic AI applied to real-time commerce. The AI premium should be 20-25% for autonomous decision systems at this scale."
2. **Proprietary Multi-Vertical ML Data Moat:** "DoorDash's dataset is unique — billions of real-time orders across food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail, with three-sided marketplace dynamics. No competitor has this multi-vertical local commerce training data. My models compound in value with every order across every vertical."
3. **Route Optimization — Direct Margin Impact:** "My delivery route optimization models directly reduce cost-per-delivery — the single most important unit economics metric for DoorDash. A 5% improvement in route efficiency at DoorDash's scale saves hundreds of millions annually. My ML work is directly margin-accretive."
4. **Competing ML Offers — Push Hard on AI Premium:** ML talent is the scarcest at DoorDash. Bring competing offers from Uber ML, Waymo, or hyperscaler AI teams: "Uber's ML team is offering $440K RSUs with 15% bonus. DoorDash's multi-vertical ML surface is broader and the proprietary dataset is richer. The equity needs to reflect the AI premium — my models make autonomous, revenue-impacting decisions at massive scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an ML/AI role building autonomous decision systems — route optimization, demand prediction, dynamic pricing, Dasher dispatch — across 5+ commerce verticals on DoorDash's proprietary dataset of billions of real-time orders, I'm targeting $440K in RSUs over 4 years with a 15% bonus and the full AI premium applied. I have competing ML offers from Uber ($435K RSUs) and [hyperscaler AI team]. DoorDash's multi-vertical ML data moat is unmatched in local commerce, and the equity should reflect that my models make millions of autonomous, revenue-impacting decisions per hour." DoorDash will counter at $380K-$430K RSUs — accept at $400K+ with 15% bonus confirmed.
