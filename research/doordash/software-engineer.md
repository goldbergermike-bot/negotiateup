**Negotiation DNA**

DoorDash is the #1 local commerce platform in the US — 37M+ monthly active consumers, 6M+ merchants, 2M+ Dashers across food delivery, grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail, and more. In 2026, DoorDash is no longer a food delivery company — it's building the total local commerce platform with 5+ verticals on a single infrastructure stack. The Wolt acquisition expanded DoorDash into 20+ European countries. DashPass (the subscription tier) drives recurring revenue across all verticals. The comp model includes equity-heavy RSUs on a standard 4-year/1-year cliff vesting schedule, competitive base, and a 10% annual bonus — giving you three negotiation levers. Equity is the primary variable lever. DoorDash competes for talent against Uber, Instacart, and the hyperscalers, so bring competing offers to maximize your package.

**Multi-Vertical Local Commerce — Beyond Food Delivery**

"DoorDash is no longer a food delivery company — it's the local commerce platform. I build infrastructure that serves food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail, and more — 5+ commerce verticals on a single platform. This multi-vertical expansion means my engineering work has 5x the revenue surface of a single-vertical delivery company. DashPass (subscription) drives recurring revenue across all verticals. When negotiating: 'I build the multi-vertical platform that serves 37M+ consumers across 5+ commerce categories. My infrastructure work has 5x the revenue surface of a food-only competitor. DoorDash's local commerce TAM is $1T+ — and I'm building the platform that captures it. My comp should reflect multi-vertical platform leverage, not single-category delivery.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Vertical Platform Multiplier:** "I'm not building for food delivery alone — every service I build runs across food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail. One engineering contribution, 5+ revenue verticals. My comp should reflect this 5x revenue surface, not a single-vertical delivery role."
2. **DashPass Subscription Revenue:** "DashPass drives recurring revenue across all verticals — subscribers order more frequently and spend more per order. My platform work directly powers the subscription engine that increases customer LTV. Recurring revenue engineers command a premium."
3. **Real-Time Systems Complexity:** "DoorDash's marketplace is a real-time, three-sided platform — consumers, Dashers, and merchants — all requiring sub-second matching, routing, and pricing decisions. This level of distributed systems complexity rivals any FAANG infrastructure team."
4. **Competing Offers — Uber/Instacart/Hyperscalers:** Bring offers from Uber, Instacart, or cloud providers. DoorDash responds aggressively to competing offers, especially from Uber. Frame: "Uber is offering $[X] RSUs. I prefer DoorDash's multi-vertical thesis, but the equity needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building infrastructure that serves 5+ commerce verticals on DoorDash's local commerce platform — not a single-category delivery app. I'd like the RSU grant increased to $235K over 4 years, with the 10% bonus confirmed. I have competing offers from Uber at $[X] and [hyperscaler] at $[Y]. DoorDash's multi-vertical expansion makes this a more impactful role, and the equity should reflect that." DoorDash will counter at $200K-$230K RSUs — accept at $215K+ with 10% bonus confirmed.
