**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at DoorDash shape the experience across three distinct user surfaces — the consumer app (37M+ MAUs), the merchant dashboard (6M+ merchants), and the Dasher experience (2M+ Dashers). In 2026, this is no longer food delivery UX — it's the design system for a multi-vertical local commerce platform spanning food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail. Each vertical has distinct user flows, merchant types, and fulfillment patterns, requiring a design system flexible enough to serve 5+ commerce categories. DashPass subscription design directly drives recurring revenue and cross-vertical engagement. The comp model includes 10% bonus, equity-heavy RSUs on a 4-year/1-year cliff vest, and competitive base. Push equity as the primary lever — DoorDash has flex on initial design equity offers. [Source: DoorDash Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Multi-Vertical Local Commerce — Beyond Food Delivery**

"DoorDash is no longer a food delivery company — it's the local commerce platform. I build infrastructure that serves food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail, and more — 5+ commerce verticals on a single platform. This multi-vertical expansion means my engineering work has 5x the revenue surface of a single-vertical delivery company. DashPass (subscription) drives recurring revenue across all verticals. When negotiating: 'I build the multi-vertical platform that serves 37M+ consumers across 5+ commerce categories. My infrastructure work has 5x the revenue surface of a food-only competitor. DoorDash's local commerce TAM is $1T+ — and I'm building the platform that captures it. My comp should reflect multi-vertical platform leverage, not single-category delivery.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Three-Surface Design Scope:** "I design across three distinct user surfaces — consumer (37M+ MAUs), merchant (6M+), and Dasher (2M+). Each has unique UX needs and real-time interaction patterns. That's three apps, three user personas, three design systems — broader scope than most single-product design roles."
2. **Multi-Vertical Design System:** "My design system must flex across food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail — each with different browse patterns, cart logic, and fulfillment flows. I'm not designing a food delivery app; I'm designing the UX for a multi-vertical commerce platform."
3. **DashPass Conversion & Retention UX:** "DashPass drives recurring revenue across all verticals. My subscription UX design directly impacts conversion rates, retention, and cross-vertical usage — the highest-value user behavior for DoorDash's business model."
4. **Competing Design Offers — Uber/Airbnb/FAANG:** Bring competing design offers: "Airbnb is offering $210K RSUs for a consumer design role. DoorDash's three-surface, multi-vertical design scope is broader, and the equity should reflect that expanded design mandate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a design role spanning three user surfaces (consumer, merchant, Dasher) across 5+ commerce verticals — including DashPass subscription UX that directly drives recurring revenue — I'm targeting $205K in RSUs over 4 years with a 10% bonus. I have competing offers from Uber Design and Airbnb. DoorDash's multi-vertical design scope is the broadest in local commerce, and the equity should reflect that." DoorDash will counter at $175K-$200K RSUs — accept at $185K+ with 10% bonus confirmed.
