**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at DoorDash design and own the technical integration layer between DoorDash's platform and 6M+ merchants — from individual restaurants to enterprise chains with thousands of locations, grocery partners, convenience stores, and retail brands. In 2026, the multi-vertical expansion means SA scope now includes food, grocery (via partnerships with major grocery chains), convenience, alcohol, and retail integrations — each with different POS systems, inventory management, menu structures, and fulfillment workflows. Enterprise restaurant partnerships (McDonald's, Chipotle, Wingstop) and new grocery/retail partnerships require deep technical architecture for real-time inventory sync, order routing, and analytics. The comp model includes 10% bonus, equity-heavy RSUs on a 4-year/1-year cliff vest, and competitive base. [Source: DoorDash SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Multi-Vertical Local Commerce — Beyond Food Delivery**

"DoorDash is no longer a food delivery company — it's the local commerce platform. I build infrastructure that serves food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail, and more — 5+ commerce verticals on a single platform. This multi-vertical expansion means my engineering work has 5x the revenue surface of a single-vertical delivery company. DashPass (subscription) drives recurring revenue across all verticals. When negotiating: 'I build the multi-vertical platform that serves 37M+ consumers across 5+ commerce categories. My infrastructure work has 5x the revenue surface of a food-only competitor. DoorDash's local commerce TAM is $1T+ — and I'm building the platform that captures it. My comp should reflect multi-vertical platform leverage, not single-category delivery.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Merchant Integration Scale:** "I architect integrations for 6M+ merchants — from single restaurants to enterprise chains with 10,000+ locations. Each integration I design for McDonald's or Chipotle scales across their entire footprint. One architecture decision, thousands of merchant locations onboarded."
2. **Multi-Vertical Integration Complexity:** "I design integrations across food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail — each with fundamentally different POS systems, inventory management, compliance requirements (alcohol age verification), and fulfillment workflows. 5 vertical types, 5 different integration architectures."
3. **Merchant Revenue Attribution:** "Every merchant integration I architect generates ongoing marketplace revenue. An enterprise grocery partnership I onboard could represent $100M+ in annual GMV. My architecture decisions directly determine merchant activation rates and order volume."
4. **Competing SA Offers — Shopify/Uber/Enterprise:** Bring competing offers from merchant-facing platforms: "Shopify is offering $260K RSUs for an enterprise SA role. DoorDash's multi-vertical merchant integration scope is broader — food, grocery, convenience, retail — and the equity should reflect that cross-vertical complexity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a Solutions Architect role designing integrations for 6M+ merchants across 5+ commerce verticals — including enterprise partnerships that represent $100M+ in annual GMV — I'm targeting $260K in RSUs over 4 years with a 10% bonus. I have a Shopify enterprise SA offer at $255K RSUs. DoorDash's multi-vertical merchant integration scope is the broadest in local commerce, and the equity should reflect that." DoorDash will counter at $225K-$255K RSUs — accept at $240K+ with 10% bonus confirmed.
