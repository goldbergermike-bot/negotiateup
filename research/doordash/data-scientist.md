**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at DoorDash work with one of the richest real-time commerce datasets in tech — billions of orders, real-time demand signals across 5+ commerce verticals, Dasher location and behavior data, merchant performance metrics, and pricing/promotion effectiveness signals for 37M+ consumers. DoorDash DS roles focus on demand forecasting, pricing optimization, marketplace dynamics (balancing the three-sided marketplace), and DashPass subscription analytics. The multi-vertical expansion from food into grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail multiplies the DS surface area — every model you build applies across 5+ categories. The comp model includes 10% bonus, equity-heavy RSUs on a 4-year/1-year cliff vest, and competitive base. Push equity as the primary lever — DoorDash DS equity offers have significant upside at the initial counter. [Source: DoorDash DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Multi-Vertical Local Commerce — Beyond Food Delivery**

"DoorDash is no longer a food delivery company — it's the local commerce platform. I build infrastructure that serves food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, retail, and more — 5+ commerce verticals on a single platform. This multi-vertical expansion means my engineering work has 5x the revenue surface of a single-vertical delivery company. DashPass (subscription) drives recurring revenue across all verticals. When negotiating: 'I build the multi-vertical platform that serves 37M+ consumers across 5+ commerce categories. My infrastructure work has 5x the revenue surface of a food-only competitor. DoorDash's local commerce TAM is $1T+ — and I'm building the platform that captures it. My comp should reflect multi-vertical platform leverage, not single-category delivery.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Real-Time Marketplace Data Moat:** "DoorDash's dataset is unique — billions of real-time orders across food, grocery, convenience, alcohol, and retail, with three-sided marketplace dynamics (consumer, merchant, Dasher). No competitor has this multi-vertical local commerce dataset. My models improve with every order across every vertical."
2. **Demand Forecasting — Multi-Vertical Scale:** "My demand forecasting models serve 5+ commerce verticals simultaneously. A single model improvement in demand prediction improves order batching, Dasher utilization, and delivery times across food, grocery, convenience, and retail — 5x the business impact of a single-category model."
3. **Pricing Optimization — Direct Revenue Impact:** "My pricing and promotion models directly determine DoorDash's take rate, delivery fees, and DashPass economics. A 1% improvement in pricing optimization at DoorDash's scale translates to hundreds of millions in revenue impact."
4. **Competing DS Offers — Uber/Instacart/FAANG:** Bring competing offers from marketplace DS teams: "Uber's marketplace DS offer is $290K RSUs. DoorDash's multi-vertical dataset is richer and more complex, and the equity should reflect the 5x category breadth of data I'll be modeling."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a DS role building demand forecasting and pricing models across 5+ commerce verticals — with DoorDash's unique three-sided marketplace dataset of billions of real-time orders — I'm targeting $290K in RSUs over 4 years with a 10% bonus. I have competing offers from Uber Marketplace DS ($285K RSUs) and Instacart. DoorDash's multi-vertical data surface is uniquely compelling for DS work, and the equity should reflect that." DoorDash will counter at $250K-$280K RSUs — accept at $265K+ with 10% bonus confirmed.
