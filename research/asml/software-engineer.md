### Software Engineer | ASML Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Bonus + RSU | EUV Lithography Monopoly | €38B+ Backlog | +0% Base Role

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Veldhoven (NL) | €68K–€78K | €15K–€30K | 8–12% | €68K–€92K |
| Wilton (CT) | $120K–$155K | $30K–$55K | 10–15% | $165K–$228K |
| San Jose | $130K–$165K | $35K–$60K | 10–15% | $175K–$228K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at ASML write the code that controls the most complex machines ever built — EUV lithography systems that print transistors at scales smaller than a wavelength of light. Because ASML holds a global monopoly on EUV technology with a €38B+ order backlog stretching years into the future, every software engineer contributes to a guaranteed revenue pipeline that no competitor can threaten. This is not a startup gamble; this is the foundation of the entire global semiconductor supply chain. (Sources: ASML 2024 Annual Report; Glassdoor ASML Software Engineer Compensation Data; Levels.fyi ASML entries.)

**Level Mapping:** ASML Software Engineer maps to Google L3–L4, Meta E3–E4, Apple ICT2–ICT3, Microsoft SDE 59–61, and TSMC Engineer I–II.

**€38B+ Backlog Monopoly — The Absolute Stability Premium**

ASML cannot be disrupted, cannot be replaced, and has years of guaranteed revenue baked into its backlog — currently exceeding €38 billion. For a Software Engineer, this means your role has unparalleled job security: the machines you help build are literally the only ones that can produce advanced chips for Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Samsung, and TSMC. No other company on Earth can do what ASML does. This absolute monopoly stability justifies demanding top-of-market base salary, especially in expensive hubs. In Veldhoven, where ASML's HQ campus dominates the local economy, cost of living has risen sharply due to the influx of ASML employees — housing costs have climbed 30%+ in recent years, and expat living costs in the Eindhoven region are substantial. Use this to push base salary toward the €78K ceiling. In Wilton, CT and San Jose, where cost of living is among the highest in the US, frame your ask around: "ASML's monopoly means zero risk of layoffs or revenue disruption — this stability justifies a base salary at the top of band, not the middle."

**Global Levers**

1. **Monopoly Stability Lever:** "ASML is the only company in the world that makes EUV lithography machines. With a €38B+ backlog, my role has more job security than any FAANG position. I'm asking for base compensation that reflects this zero-disruption-risk environment."
2. **Semiconductor Criticality Lever:** "Every advanced chip on the planet depends on ASML technology. My software work directly enables the machines that power the global economy — this isn't optional infrastructure, it's mandatory."
3. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have competing offers from [TSMC/Intel/Applied Materials] at $145K base. Given ASML's monopoly position and guaranteed revenue, I'd expect ASML to match or exceed this for talent retention."
4. **Veldhoven Cost-of-Living Lever:** "Veldhoven's housing costs have increased dramatically due to ASML's growth. My base salary needs to reflect the real cost of living in the Eindhoven metro, not outdated benchmarks — I'm targeting €76K–€78K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about ASML's unmatched position in semiconductor lithography. Based on my research and competing offers, I'm targeting a base salary of €76K in Veldhoven or $150K in Wilton/San Jose. Given that ASML has a €38B+ backlog and zero competitive threat to its EUV monopoly, this role offers stability that justifies top-of-band base pay. I have a competing offer at $142K base from Applied Materials, and I'd love to move forward with ASML if we can close the gap. My accept-at floor is €72K / $140K base — below that, I'd need to seriously weigh the Applied Materials offer."
