**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at ASML lead teams that build the software and systems controlling the most sophisticated manufacturing equipment ever created. You are responsible for the velocity, quality, and technical direction of teams whose output directly impacts whether TSMC, Samsung, and Intel can manufacture next-generation chips on schedule. ASML's monopoly on EUV lithography means there is no competitor poaching your best engineers with a rival product — but FAANG companies absolutely will try to poach them with higher comp. Your ability to retain and grow world-class engineering talent is worth billions in backlog execution.

**Level Mapping:** ASML Engineering Manager maps to Google L6 Manager, Meta M1, Apple Engineering Manager, Microsoft SDE Manager 65–66, and TSMC Section Manager.

**€38B+ Backlog Monopoly — The Absolute Stability Premium**

ASML can't be disrupted, can't be replaced, and has years of guaranteed revenue — this stability justifies top-of-market base salary. As an Engineering Manager, you are the linchpin between ASML's enormous backlog and actual product delivery. The €38B+ in committed orders creates a unique management challenge: you're not managing a team that might be reorged or have its product canceled — you're managing a team with years of guaranteed, mission-critical work. This stability means ASML can and should invest in management talent at the top of market. In Veldhoven, the challenge of attracting and retaining engineering managers is acute — the city is small, competition from Eindhoven-based tech companies and Amsterdam's tech scene is real, and ASML's HQ campus requires managers who can navigate a deeply technical, international culture. Push for €115K–€118K base. In Wilton and San Jose, engineering managers with semiconductor expertise are scarce; use competing offers from Intel, Qualcomm, or NVIDIA to drive base toward $240K–$245K.

**Global Levers**

1. **Backlog Execution Lever:** "ASML has €38B+ in committed orders that my team needs to help deliver. You're not hiring a manager for a speculative product — you're hiring someone to execute on guaranteed revenue. That execution responsibility justifies top-of-band management compensation."
2. **Talent Retention Lever:** "My primary job is retaining world-class engineers who are constantly being recruited by FAANG companies offering 30–50% more total comp. If my own compensation isn't competitive, I can't credibly make the case for my reports to stay. I need to be at $240K+ base to lead effectively."
3. **Semiconductor Management Scarcity Lever:** "Engineering managers with deep semiconductor software expertise are exceptionally rare. Most managers in tech come from web/cloud backgrounds. My domain expertise in [lithography software / embedded systems / computational optics] makes me a scarce asset — my comp should reflect that scarcity."
4. **International Complexity Lever (Veldhoven):** "Managing engineering teams at ASML Veldhoven requires navigating a highly international, multi-cultural environment with team members from 90+ nationalities. This complexity premium — on top of the technical domain expertise required — justifies €115K–€118K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about leading engineering teams at the company that literally makes the machines that make modern technology possible. I'm targeting €115K base in Veldhoven or $242K in Wilton/San Jose. I have a management offer from Intel at $230K base and one from a FAANG at $250K base with stronger RSU. ASML's monopoly and €38B+ backlog mean I'd be managing against guaranteed demand — a uniquely stable management position. But stability alone doesn't pay Wilton mortgages or Veldhoven rents. My accept-at floor is €108K / $230K base — below that, the Intel offer with its broader RSU upside becomes the rational choice."
