### Technical Program Manager | ASML Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Bonus + RSU | EUV Lithography Monopoly | €38B+ Backlog | +0% TPM Band

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Veldhoven (NL) | €72K–€85K | €18K–€32K | 10–15% | €72K–€98K |
| Wilton (CT) | $125K–$170K | $35K–$60K | 12–18% | $178K–$248K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at ASML orchestrate the most complex engineering programs in the technology industry — coordinating thousands of engineers across optics, mechatronics, software, and systems integration to deliver EUV lithography platforms that push the boundaries of physics. These are not typical software sprints; a single EUV machine contains over 100,000 components sourced from 5,000+ suppliers, and the delivery timeline directly impacts whether the world's largest chipmakers can meet their technology roadmaps. The €38B+ backlog means your programs have committed customers — the urgency is not market risk but execution excellence.

**Level Mapping:** ASML Technical Program Manager maps to Google L5 TPM, Meta TPM IC5, Apple TPM, Microsoft TPM 63–64, and semiconductor industry Senior Program Manager.

**€38B+ Backlog Monopoly — The Absolute Stability Premium**

ASML can't be disrupted, can't be replaced, and has years of guaranteed revenue — this stability justifies top-of-market base salary. As a TPM, you are the connective tissue that turns ASML's €38B+ backlog into delivered machines. Every program you manage has a guaranteed customer waiting — and often a customer whose own multi-billion-dollar fab construction timeline depends on your delivery schedule. This is not speculative program management; this is execution against committed orders where delays cost customers billions. In Veldhoven, TPMs navigate a complex, matrix-style organization with teams spread across the Netherlands, the US, Taiwan, and Korea. The international coordination demands, combined with Veldhoven's rising living costs, justify €82K–€85K base. In the US, TPMs with hardware program management experience — especially in semiconductor equipment — are rare. Most TPM talent comes from software-only environments. Target $168K–$170K base.

**Global Levers**

1. **Backlog Execution Lever:** "The €38B+ backlog isn't aspirational — it's committed orders. As a TPM, I'm directly responsible for converting backlog into delivered machines on schedule. Delays don't just disappoint — they disrupt global chip production timelines. This execution criticality justifies top-of-market TPM compensation."
2. **Cross-Functional Complexity Lever:** "ASML programs span optics, mechatronics, software, and supply chain across 5,000+ suppliers and 60+ nationalities. This is the most complex technical program management in any industry. A Google TPM manages software releases; I'd manage the delivery of machines that cost $200M+ each."
3. **Hardware TPM Scarcity Lever:** "Technical Program Managers with hardware delivery experience — especially in semiconductor capital equipment — are exceptionally scarce. Most TPMs in the market have managed software releases or cloud migrations. My experience managing [hardware integration / cross-functional delivery / supply chain coordination] commands a $168K+ base premium."
4. **Customer Delivery Impact Lever (Veldhoven):** "When my programs slip, TSMC or Samsung delays a fab ramp worth billions. The customer impact of my delivery performance is orders of magnitude larger than typical TPM roles. I'm targeting €82K–€85K in Veldhoven, reflecting this extraordinary accountability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Managing programs at ASML means orchestrating the delivery of the most complex machines ever built — with billions of dollars of customer revenue depending on my execution. I'm targeting €83K base in Veldhoven or $168K in Wilton/San Jose. I have a competing offer from Google at $172K base for a TPM role with significantly less complexity and impact. ASML's €38B+ backlog gives my programs guaranteed customers — but the execution stakes are far higher than any software company. My accept-at floor is €78K / $158K base — below that, the Google offer's lower stress and better RSU liquidity make it the rational choice, despite ASML's more compelling mission."
