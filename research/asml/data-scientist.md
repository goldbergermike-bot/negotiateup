**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at ASML analyze the most valuable manufacturing data in the world — wafer-level metrology, machine performance telemetry, and yield optimization data from every advanced fab on the planet. Because ASML holds a monopoly on EUV lithography, the data flowing through ASML's systems represents the entire universe of advanced chipmaking. There is no other dataset like it anywhere. The €38B+ backlog ensures a constantly expanding data footprint as new machines are deployed, creating an ever-richer analytical environment.

**Level Mapping:** ASML Data Scientist maps to Google L4 Data Scientist, Meta Data Scientist IC4, Apple Data Scientist, Microsoft Data Scientist 61–63, and TSMC Data Analytics Engineer.

**€38B+ Backlog Monopoly — The Absolute Stability Premium**

ASML can't be disrupted, can't be replaced, and has years of guaranteed revenue — this stability justifies top-of-market base salary. As a Data Scientist, you work with proprietary data that literally cannot exist anywhere else — machine performance data from every EUV system in the world. The €38B+ backlog means the data universe is guaranteed to grow as new machines ship, creating increasingly powerful analytical opportunities. Your insights directly drive machine uptime improvements, predictive maintenance, and yield optimization that are worth billions to ASML's customers. In Veldhoven, data science talent competes with the broader Dutch tech ecosystem — Eindhoven's growing tech hub (Philips, NXP, TomTom) and Amsterdam's data science scene both draw from the same talent pool. Push for €82K–€85K base, citing ASML's unique data monopoly. In the US, data scientists with semiconductor or industrial data experience are scarce; most talent skews toward ad-tech, fintech, or SaaS. Use this specialization to push toward $170K–$175K base.

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Monopoly Lever:** "ASML's data is as monopolistic as its machines. I'd be working with the only complete dataset of EUV lithography performance in the world — data that cannot be replicated by any competitor. This unique data access justifies top-of-market data science compensation."
2. **Predictive Maintenance Revenue Lever:** "My analytical work directly impacts machine uptime — each hour of downtime costs ASML's customers millions in lost production. Improving predictive maintenance accuracy by even 1% across the installed base translates to enormous customer value. My comp should reflect this high-leverage impact."
3. **Industrial Data Science Scarcity Lever:** "Data scientists with semiconductor manufacturing domain knowledge are rare. Most DS talent is trained on web-scale consumer data. My ability to apply statistical methods to lithography metrology and machine telemetry data is a specialized skill commanding $170K+ base."
4. **Eindhoven Tech Hub Competition Lever (Veldhoven):** "Philips, NXP, and TomTom are all hiring data scientists in the Eindhoven area at €75K–€85K base. ASML's data is more unique and more impactful than any of these companies — the compensation should reflect the monopoly-grade data I'd be working with. I'm targeting €82K–€85K."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "The opportunity to work with ASML's unique lithography dataset — the only one of its kind in the world — is what draws me here. I'm targeting €83K base in Veldhoven or $172K in Wilton/San Jose. I have a competing offer from NXP at €78K base in Eindhoven and one from a FAANG at $180K base in the Bay Area. ASML's data monopoly parallels its machine monopoly — both are irreplaceable. My analytical insights would directly improve machine uptime and yield across a €38B+ backlog of committed orders. My accept-at floor is €78K / $160K base — below that, the FAANG offer's RSU upside makes it the stronger financial choice."
