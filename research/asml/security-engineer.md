**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at ASML protect the crown jewels of the global semiconductor industry. ASML's EUV lithography technology is arguably the most strategically important intellectual property in the world — governments consider it critical infrastructure, export controls restrict its sale, and nation-states have demonstrated active interest in acquiring ASML's technology through espionage. A security breach at ASML wouldn't just cost the company money — it could shift the global balance of semiconductor manufacturing capability. The €38B+ backlog makes ASML an even higher-value target.

**Level Mapping:** ASML Security Engineer maps to Google L4–L5 Security Engineer, Meta Security Engineer IC4–IC5, Apple Information Security Engineer, Microsoft Security SDE 61–64, and semiconductor industry Senior Cybersecurity Engineer.

**€38B+ Backlog Monopoly — The Absolute Stability Premium**

ASML can't be disrupted, can't be replaced, and has years of guaranteed revenue — this stability justifies top-of-market base salary. As a Security Engineer, the monopoly argument is uniquely powerful: ASML's technology is so strategically important that it is subject to government export controls (the Dutch government, under US pressure, restricts EUV sales to China). The €38B+ backlog makes ASML the highest-value target in the semiconductor industry for cyber espionage, IP theft, and nation-state attacks. Your security work doesn't just protect corporate revenue — it protects technology that governments classify as critical to national security. This extraordinary scope of responsibility justifies security compensation at the very top of the market. In Veldhoven, security engineers with the required clearance levels and semiconductor IP protection experience are exceptionally scarce. Push for €90K–€92K base. In the US, where ASML handles sensitive customer data from Intel and defense-adjacent semiconductor work, security engineers with relevant experience command $185K–$188K base.

**Global Levers**

1. **National Security Lever:** "ASML's EUV technology is subject to government export controls and is considered critical to national security by multiple governments. As a Security Engineer, I'm not protecting a social media platform — I'm protecting technology that shapes global geopolitical power. This strategic importance demands top-of-market security compensation."
2. **Nation-State Threat Lever:** "ASML has publicly disclosed cyber incidents and faces persistent nation-state-level threats. Defending against APT groups targeting the world's most valuable semiconductor IP requires elite security talent. My compensation should reflect the threat level I'm defending against — $185K+ base minimum."
3. **IP Protection Value Lever:** "A single successful breach could compromise technology worth billions in R&D investment and decades of development. My security work protects an IP portfolio that literally cannot be replicated by any other company on Earth. The value I protect justifies compensation well above typical enterprise security roles."
4. **Export Control Complexity Lever (Veldhoven):** "ASML security must navigate a complex web of Dutch, EU, and US export control regulations while defending against sophisticated threat actors. This regulatory-technical dual mandate — combined with the need for security clearance — makes qualified candidates rare. I'm targeting €90K–€92K base for this specialized role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Protecting ASML's technology means defending the most strategically important IP in the semiconductor industry — technology that governments classify as national security infrastructure. I'm targeting €90K base in Veldhoven or $185K in Wilton/San Jose. I have a competing offer from a FAANG at $192K base for a security role with far less geopolitical significance. ASML's €38B+ backlog and monopoly status make it the highest-value target in the semiconductor industry — the security engineering bar must be world-class, and the compensation should match. My accept-at floor is €85K / $175K base — below that, I'd take the FAANG offer where the threat model is commercially motivated hackers, not nation-states."
