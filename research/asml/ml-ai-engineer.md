**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at ASML apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to the most consequential manufacturing challenge on Earth — optimizing the production of advanced semiconductors. From computational lithography optimization to predictive maintenance models, from wafer defect detection to machine learning-driven overlay correction, your AI models directly improve the yield of every advanced chip produced globally. ASML's EUV monopoly means you are training models on the only complete dataset of advanced lithography performance in existence — a dataset no competitor can replicate. The €38B+ backlog guarantees a continuously growing training data corpus. The **+15-25% AI Premium** reflects the extraordinary market demand for ML/AI talent combined with ASML's unique data advantage.

**Level Mapping:** ASML ML/AI Engineer maps to Google L4–L5 ML Engineer, Meta ML Engineer IC4–IC5, Apple ML Engineer, Microsoft ML Engineer 62–65, and semiconductor industry Senior AI/ML Scientist.

**€38B+ Backlog Monopoly — The Absolute Stability Premium**

ASML can't be disrupted, can't be replaced, and has years of guaranteed revenue — this stability justifies top-of-market base salary. As an ML/AI Engineer, you benefit from a double monopoly: ASML's monopoly on EUV machines AND a monopoly on the data these machines generate. No other company on Earth has access to the complete global dataset of EUV lithography performance. Your ML models train on irreplaceable data and deploy to an irreplaceable platform — this is the most defensible AI position in the entire technology industry. The €38B+ backlog means your models will be deployed to a growing fleet of machines, with each new deployment adding to the training data that makes your models better. In Veldhoven, ML/AI engineers are being aggressively recruited by both the local semiconductor cluster (NXP, Philips, Signify) and remote positions at FAANG companies. Housing costs near the ASML campus have surged, and the overall cost of living in the Eindhoven area now approaches Amsterdam levels for desirable neighborhoods. The AI premium should push base to €105K–€108K. In the US, ML/AI engineers in any domain command significant premiums; combine that with semiconductor specialization, and you should target $210K–$215K base.

**Global Levers**

1. **Double Monopoly Lever:** "ASML has a monopoly on EUV machines AND a monopoly on EUV data. As an ML/AI Engineer, I'm training models on a dataset that literally cannot exist anywhere else. This irreplaceable data advantage — combined with the current AI talent market — justifies the +15-25% AI premium on top of already-competitive base compensation."
2. **AI Talent War Lever:** "Every major tech company is competing for ML/AI talent. Google, Meta, and OpenAI are offering $200K–$300K+ base for senior ML engineers. ASML needs to compete for this talent with compensation that reflects both the AI market premium and ASML's unique data advantage. I'm targeting $210K+ base."
3. **Yield Impact Lever:** "A 0.1% improvement in wafer yield across ASML's installed base translates to billions of dollars in customer value. My ML models directly drive these yield improvements. The economic impact of my work dwarfs my compensation — a $210K base is a trivial investment relative to the yield gains I can deliver."
4. **Computational Lithography AI Lever:** "Computational lithography — using AI to optimize mask patterns and exposure recipes — is the frontier of ASML's technology roadmap. This work requires deep ML expertise combined with physics understanding. Engineers at this intersection command €105K+ in Europe and $210K+ in the US."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "ASML's double monopoly — on machines and on data — makes this the most defensible ML/AI position in the entire tech industry. I'm targeting €105K base in Veldhoven or $212K in Wilton/San Jose, reflecting the +15-25% AI premium. I have competing offers from Google at $220K base (ML infrastructure) and from NVIDIA at $208K base (chip design ML). ASML's €38B+ backlog guarantees a continuously growing training dataset from an expanding machine fleet — no other AI role offers this level of data moat. My accept-at floor is €98K / $195K base — below that, the Google offer's RSU package and AI research resources become very compelling, despite ASML's superior data advantage."
