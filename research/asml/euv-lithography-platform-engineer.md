### EUV Lithography Platform Engineer | ASML Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** SIGNATURE ROLE | Base-Heavy + Bonus + RSU | EUV Lithography Monopoly | €38B+ Backlog | +25-35% EUV Monopoly Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Veldhoven (NL) | €118K–€142K | €40K–€80K | 15–22% | €118K–€168K |
| Wilton (CT) | $185K–$260K | $70K–$105K | 18–25% | $275K–$385K |
| San Jose | $195K–$270K | $75K–$110K | 18–25% | $285K–$385K |

**Negotiation DNA**

The EUV Lithography Platform Engineer is ASML's **SIGNATURE** role — the engineer who works directly on the core EUV lithography platform, the single most complex and valuable piece of technology ever created by human engineering. This role encompasses the systems engineering, integration, and optimization of EUV scanners that use 13.5nm wavelength light generated by laser-produced plasma to print transistor features at scales that seemed physically impossible a decade ago. Each EUV machine contains 100,000+ precision components, uses mirrors polished to sub-nanometer accuracy, and operates in conditions that push the boundaries of known physics. There are fewer than 200 EUV machines in the world, each worth $200M–$400M+, and every single one was built by ASML. The €38B+ backlog represents years of committed demand for the platform you engineer. The **+25-35% EUV Monopoly Premium** reflects the absolute rarity of this expertise — there is no other company where you can gain this experience, no alternative career path that offers this specialization, and no competitor bidding for this exact skill set. You are, by definition, irreplaceable.

**Level Mapping:** ASML EUV Lithography Platform Engineer maps to Google L5–L6 Systems Engineer, Meta E5–E6 Infrastructure, Apple ICT4–ICT5, Microsoft Principal SDE 64–66, TSMC Senior/Principal Process Integration Engineer. Note: this mapping is approximate — no other company has a truly equivalent role, as no other company builds EUV lithography systems.

**€38B+ Backlog Monopoly — The Absolute Stability Premium**

ASML can't be disrupted, can't be replaced, and has years of guaranteed revenue — this stability justifies top-of-market base salary. As an EUV Lithography Platform Engineer, you embody this monopoly more than any other role at ASML. You are the human embodiment of ASML's competitive moat — your expertise exists only because ASML exists, and ASML's dominance is only possible because of engineers like you. The €38B+ backlog is not an abstract financial metric; it is a direct count of the platforms you will help engineer, integrate, test, and deliver. Each machine in that backlog represents months of your expertise applied to a system that no other company on Earth can produce.

In Veldhoven, where the ASML campus is the center of the global EUV universe, the cost of living has been reshaped by ASML's growth. Housing within commuting distance of the campus has become fiercely competitive — prices in Veldhoven, Eindhoven, and surrounding communities have risen 35-45% in recent years, driven largely by ASML's expanding workforce. International engineers face additional costs: Dutch language education, international schooling for children, and the adjustment to a smaller city after careers in major tech hubs. The EUV Monopoly Premium must account for these costs. Push base salary to €138K–€142K — this is not a standard engineering role, and the compensation cannot be benchmarked against standard Dutch engineering pay scales.

In Wilton, CT, where ASML's US EUV operations are headquartered, Fairfield County living costs are among the highest in the US. Combined with Connecticut's state income tax, an EUV Platform Engineer needs $255K–$260K base to achieve meaningful savings. In San Jose, where ASML's Silicon Valley presence supports customer-facing EUV work, the calculus is similar: $260K–$270K base is required to compete with senior roles at NVIDIA, Intel, and Applied Materials, none of which offer the monopoly stability that ASML provides.

The negotiation floor for this role should be aggressive: no candidate with genuine EUV platform expertise should accept below €125K base in Veldhoven or $240K in the US. This expertise took years to develop, cannot be acquired elsewhere, and is literally irreplaceable.

**Global Levers**

1. **Absolute Irreplaceability Lever:** "I am one of a very small number of engineers in the world with hands-on EUV lithography platform expertise. This knowledge can only be gained at ASML — no university teaches it, no competitor offers it, and no amount of hiring can quickly replicate it. My compensation must reflect that I am, in the most literal sense, irreplaceable. I'm targeting €140K / $260K base with the +25-35% EUV Monopoly Premium."
2. **Platform Revenue Multiplication Lever:** "Each EUV platform I help engineer generates $200M–$400M+ in revenue. Across the €38B+ backlog, my platform work touches billions in committed revenue. My salary is a rounding error compared to the revenue my expertise enables — and yet I need to be compensated at a level that prevents me from leaving this monopoly for a well-funded competitor's R&D lab."
3. **High-NA EUV Strategic Lever:** "ASML is transitioning to High-NA EUV — the next generation of lithography that will extend Moore's Law. Platform engineers with current EUV experience are the only people qualified to work on High-NA systems. This technology transition creates acute demand for my exact skill set. I'm leveraging this to push for the top of the +25-35% premium band."
4. **Global Talent Monopoly Lever:** "There are perhaps a few hundred engineers in the world with deep EUV platform expertise, and the vast majority already work at ASML. You cannot hire this role from a competitor, because there is no competitor. The only way to fill this role is to train someone for years or pay top-of-market to retain existing talent. Retention comp for me should be €140K+ / $260K+ base — the cost of losing and replacing me is orders of magnitude higher."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "This is the most unique engineering role in the global technology industry. I work on the only machines that can produce advanced semiconductors — machines worth $200M–$400M each, with a €38B+ backlog of committed orders. My EUV platform expertise cannot be hired from any competitor because there is no competitor. I'm targeting €140K base in Veldhoven or $258K in Wilton/San Jose, reflecting the full +25-35% EUV Monopoly Premium. I have interest from Intel's advanced packaging team at $245K base and from TSMC's process integration group, but neither can offer me the chance to work on the source technology itself — only ASML can. That said, my expertise has genuine market value, and I need compensation that reflects my irreplaceability. My accept-at floor is €128K / $242K base. Below that, I would explore Intel's offer seriously, because while they don't build the machines, they are offering competitive compensation for adjacent expertise. ASML's monopoly means the company can absolutely afford to pay top-of-market — and for this role, the market is defined by ASML itself."
