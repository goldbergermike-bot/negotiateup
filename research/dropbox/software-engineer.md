Dropbox Software Engineers build features across the cloud platform and Dash AI product for 700M+ registered users — working on file sync, sharing, collaboration, and universal search capabilities. In February 2026, SWEs work across an expanding product surface as Dash AI adds new feature areas alongside the core file platform. The Virtual First culture enables remote-first work with competitive compensation.

As an $8B+ NASDAQ company, Dropbox offers liquid RSU packages even at the SWE level, providing immediate value compared to private company equity. The company's engineering culture emphasizes craftsmanship and technical quality, with engineers owning features end-to-end.
