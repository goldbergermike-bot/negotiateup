### 🏗️ Dropbox Dash AI Partnership & Integration Program Lever

Dropbox's 2026 Dash strategy requires TPMs to manage complex multi-party programs — coordinating engineering delivery with partnership integrations (Google, Microsoft, Slack, Salesforce), managing API dependency timelines, and ensuring integration quality across 30+ enterprise application connectors. The program management challenge involves external dependency management at a scale unique to Dash's universal search approach.

TPMs must coordinate between internal engineering teams and external partner APIs, manage the rollout of new enterprise source integrations, and track cross-functional dependencies between AI, platform, security, and partnership teams.

**Global Levers**

2. **Strategic Pivot Program Management:** "I manage Dropbox's most critical strategic programs — coordinating the Dash AI transformation across engineering, partnerships, enterprise sales, and marketing. Program management during a company pivot requires exceptional stakeholder management."
3. **Enterprise Rollout Coordination:** "I coordinate the enterprise rollout of Dash AI — managing deployment timelines, partner integration readiness, and customer migration programs for Fortune 500 accounts."
4. **Box/Elastic/Google Competition:** "Box, Elastic, and Google are hiring TPMs for enterprise platform programs. Dropbox must offer competitive comp to retain TPMs who can manage multi-partner AI integration programs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $222K base and $260K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Technical Program Manager role. I manage the cross-functional Dash AI integration program — coordinating engineering with Google, Microsoft, and Slack partnership teams for 700M+ users. TPMs with multi-partner AI platform integration expertise are rare. I have competing offers from [Google TPM at $330K TC / Box TPM at $312K TC / Elastic TPM at $305K TC]. Technical program managers who can manage universal search partnership programs are in exceptional demand." Accept at $195K+ base and $215K+ RSUs.
