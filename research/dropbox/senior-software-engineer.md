Dropbox Senior Software Engineers are the technical backbone of the cloud platform — building and scaling file sync, sharing, collaboration, and the Dash AI universal search product for 700M+ registered users. In February 2026, senior engineers lead the technical execution of Dropbox's AI transformation, architecting how Dash connects to enterprise applications, how AI search results are ranked, and how the platform scales to support universal search workloads alongside core file operations.

As an $8B+ NASDAQ company, Dropbox offers competitive RSU packages with strong liquidity. The Virtual First remote culture provides location flexibility with competitive compensation. Senior engineers have significant technical influence in a company undergoing its most important strategic pivot.
