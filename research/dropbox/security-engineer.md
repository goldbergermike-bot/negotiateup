### Security Engineer | Dropbox Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Heavy (NASDAQ: DBX) + Bonus | Dash AI & Cloud Security | $8B+ Market Cap | 700M+ Users | **DASH AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K–$232K | $158K–$278K | 10–15% | $245K–$345K |
| Seattle | $180K–$228K | $152K–$270K | 10–15% | $238K–$335K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Dropbox Security Engineers protect the cloud storage and collaboration platform serving 700M+ registered users — securing file sync, sharing, and the emerging Dash AI universal search product that connects to dozens of third-party enterprise applications. In February 2026, the Dash AI expansion dramatically increases the security surface: Dash connects to Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, and 30+ other enterprise tools, each connection creating new attack vectors and data privacy challenges that require specialized security expertise.

As an $8B+ market cap company on NASDAQ, Dropbox offers liquid RSU packages. The Virtual First culture enables remote work with Bay Area-competitive compensation. Security Engineers are central to enterprise trust — Dropbox stores some of the most sensitive business files in the world, and enterprise adoption depends on demonstrable security posture.

### 🏗️ Dropbox Dash AI Multi-Source Security Lever

Dropbox's 2026 Dash AI strategy requires Security Engineers to solve novel multi-source security challenges — securing the OAuth connections to 30+ enterprise applications, preventing data leakage across tenant boundaries in the unified search index, and building access controls that respect the permission models of every connected source simultaneously. The security challenge is unprecedented: Dash's universal search means a single vulnerability could expose data from multiple enterprise applications.

Security Engineers must develop threat models for AI-powered universal search, implement prompt injection protections for Dash AI, and ensure cross-source access controls maintain zero-trust principles across a heterogeneous permission landscape.

**Global Levers**

1. **Dash AI Multi-Source Security:** "I build the security architecture for Dash's universal search — protecting OAuth connections to 30+ enterprise apps, preventing cross-source data leakage, and implementing access controls across heterogeneous permission models for 700M+ users."
2. **Cloud File Security at Scale:** "Dropbox stores billions of the world's most sensitive business files. I build the encryption, access control, and threat detection systems protecting this data — a responsibility that impacts enterprise trust globally."
3. **AI Prompt Injection Defense:** "I develop defenses against prompt injection and AI-specific attacks in Dash — preventing adversarial inputs from manipulating universal search results or exposing data across tenant boundaries."
4. **1Password/Box/Cloudflare Competition:** "1Password, Box, and Cloudflare are hiring security engineers with AI and multi-source security expertise. Dropbox must offer competitive comp to retain security talent who can protect universal search infrastructure."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $270K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Security Engineer role. I build the security architecture for Dash AI's universal search — protecting 30+ enterprise app connections for 700M+ users. Security engineers with multi-source AI security expertise are in extreme shortage. I have competing offers from [Google SecEng at $338K TC / 1Password at $322K TC / Cloudflare at $328K TC]. Security engineers who can protect AI-powered universal search are the scarcest security talent in 2026." Accept at $198K+ base and $225K+ RSUs.
