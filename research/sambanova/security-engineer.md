### Security Engineer | SambaNova Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | AI Inference Hardware | Composition of Experts Architecture | +22% Agentic Orchestrator Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Palo Alto | $150K–$195K | $30K–$52K | 10–15% | $195K–$272K |
| Austin | $135K–$175K | $25K–$44K | 10–15% | $175K–$242K |
| Remote US | $128K–$168K | $22K–$40K | 10–15% | $165K–$230K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at SambaNova protect the most sensitive layer of the AI inference stack — the Composition of Experts (CoE) platform that processes enterprise customers' proprietary data and models on custom SN40L hardware. At a ~$5B valuation, SambaNova's enterprise credibility depends on demonstrating that CoE meets the security and compliance standards (SOC 2, FedRAMP, HIPAA) that Fortune 500 customers require before deploying AI inference on non-GPU platforms. Levels.fyi and Glassdoor (2025–2026) report Security Engineer base salaries at SambaNova in the $150K–$195K range in the Bay Area, with equity grants reflecting the outsized impact that security has on enterprise deal closures and regulatory compliance.

**Level Mapping:** SambaNova Security Engineer ~ Google Security Engineer (L4–L5) | Meta Security Engineer (IC4–IC5) | Amazon Security Engineer II–III | Apple Security | Microsoft Security Engineer (62–64)

**Composition of Experts — The Agentic Orchestrator Premium**

SambaNova's CoE architecture introduces novel security challenges that don't exist in GPU-based inference systems. The Memory Wall — the fundamental bottleneck where GPU-based systems run out of memory trying to serve large models — is solved by CoE through dynamic composition of multiple expert models, but this multi-expert architecture creates new attack surfaces: expert model isolation, inter-expert communication security, dynamic model loading integrity, and memory protection across the reconfigurable dataflow units. As a Security Engineer, you are the defensive Agentic Orchestrator — you secure the composition layer that orchestrates multiple AI experts, ensuring that one customer's expert models can't leak data to another's, that dynamically loaded experts haven't been tampered with, and that the orchestration control plane is hardened against adversarial manipulation. This is AI inference security at a level of complexity that GPU-based platforms don't face — on a GPU, you secure one model; on CoE, you secure the orchestration of many. The 20–30% Agentic Orchestrator premium is justified because security engineers who understand multi-model orchestration threats, reconfigurable hardware security, and enterprise compliance for novel AI architectures are effectively non-existent in the talent market. SambaNova's late-stage equity (~$5B valuation) adds financial upside, and your work directly enables the enterprise deals that drive IPO valuation.

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Expert Security Novelty:** "Securing CoE's multi-expert orchestration layer is a fundamentally new security discipline — no other platform requires protecting dynamic model composition at this level. My security expertise adapts to this novel architecture."
2. **Enterprise Compliance Enablement:** "Fortune 500 customers require SOC 2, FedRAMP, and HIPAA compliance before deploying AI inference. My security work directly unblocks enterprise revenue."
3. **Pre-IPO Security Posture:** "Security incidents at a pre-IPO company are existential risks. My work protecting the CoE platform directly de-risks the path to IPO."
4. **FAANG Security Benchmark:** "I'm evaluating a Security Engineer offer from [Google/Amazon] at $275K–$310K fully liquid TC. The equity grant needs to bridge the liquidity gap and reflect the novel security challenges at SambaNova."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm compelled by the security challenge of protecting a multi-expert AI orchestration platform — this is the most novel security problem in AI infrastructure. My competing offer is $295K total comp from a public company with liquid RSUs. Given the liquidity discount and the unique security challenges of CoE, I'd like to target $185K base with a $60K equity grant (at current 409A), bringing total comp to approximately $265K–$272K. My accept-at floor is $165K base + $42K equity ($222K total comp) — below that, the risk premium isn't justified against a liquid alternative with well-understood security scope. The Agentic Orchestrator premium reflects the fact that I'm securing the orchestration of multiple AI experts — a security discipline that I'd be among the first to define."
