**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at SambaNova make the Composition of Experts (CoE) platform usable — they design the interfaces, dashboards, and developer experiences that allow enterprise customers to deploy, monitor, and orchestrate AI inference workloads on SambaNova hardware. At a ~$5B valuation, the company is transitioning from a hardware-first R&D organization to an enterprise platform company, and design quality is a critical differentiator. Levels.fyi and Glassdoor (2025–2026) report Product Designer base salaries at SambaNova in the $118K–$152K range in the Bay Area, with pre-IPO equity that rewards designers who help define the product experience during the pre-IPO growth phase.

**Level Mapping:** SambaNova Product Designer ~ Google UX Designer (L4–L5) | Meta Product Designer (IC4–IC5) | Amazon UX Designer (SDE II equiv.) | Apple Designer | Microsoft Designer (61–63)

**Composition of Experts — The Agentic Orchestrator Premium**

SambaNova's CoE architecture is technically groundbreaking, but its enterprise adoption depends on designers who can make multi-expert AI orchestration intuitive and accessible. The Memory Wall is the fundamental bottleneck where GPU-based systems run out of memory trying to serve large models; CoE solves this by dynamically composing smaller expert models — but enterprise customers need to understand, configure, and monitor this composition through well-designed interfaces. As a Product Designer, you are the experience-layer Agentic Orchestrator — you design the control planes, visualization systems, and configuration workflows that allow non-specialists to orchestrate AI experts. You're solving the "usability wall" that sits directly on top of the Memory Wall: if customers can't intuitively compose and manage expert models, the technology doesn't matter. This requires a rare intersection of AI infrastructure literacy and design craft that virtually no designer in the market possesses. The 20–30% Agentic Orchestrator premium reflects this scarcity — SambaNova needs designers who can think in terms of expert routing, inference latency, and memory allocation while creating elegant user experiences. Combined with late-stage equity upside (~$5B valuation), this role provides both creative fulfillment and significant financial optionality.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Platform UX Scarcity:** "Designers who understand AI inference architecture well enough to design orchestration interfaces are nearly non-existent. I bring both the design craft and the technical depth SambaNova needs."
2. **Pre-IPO Design Impact:** "Enterprise product adoption is directly correlated with design quality. My work during the pre-IPO window will determine whether CoE becomes the default enterprise inference platform."
3. **Developer Experience Expertise:** "I specialize in developer-facing product design — building the dashboards, APIs, and configuration surfaces that AI/ML teams actually want to use."
4. **FAANG Designer Benchmark:** "I'm evaluating a design offer from [Google/Apple] at $210K–$240K fully liquid TC. The equity grant should bridge the gap given the illiquidity risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the design challenge of making CoE orchestration intuitive for enterprise users — this is the most technically interesting design problem in AI infrastructure. My competing offer is $225K total comp from a public company. Given the liquidity discount and the rarity of designers who understand AI inference, I'd like to target $145K base with a $45K equity grant (at current 409A), bringing total comp to approximately $205K–$212K. My accept-at floor is $128K base + $32K equity ($172K total comp) — below that, the risk doesn't justify leaving a liquid offer. The Agentic Orchestrator premium reflects my ability to design the experience layer that makes multi-expert AI composition accessible to enterprise customers."
