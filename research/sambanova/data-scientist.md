**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at SambaNova analyze and optimize the performance of the Composition of Experts (CoE) inference platform — they develop the benchmarks, performance models, and data-driven insights that guide hardware and software engineering decisions. At a ~$5B valuation, SambaNova needs data scientists who can quantify the Memory Wall problem and demonstrate CoE's superiority over GPU-based alternatives with rigorous empirical evidence. Levels.fyi and Glassdoor (2025–2026) report Data Scientist base salaries at SambaNova in the $142K–$185K range in the Bay Area, with equity grants that provide meaningful exposure to the company's pre-IPO trajectory.

**Composition of Experts — The Agentic Orchestrator Premium**

SambaNova's CoE architecture generates a wealth of data that determines how expert models are composed, selected, and orchestrated — and Data Scientists are the ones who mine this data for insights that improve inference quality and efficiency. The Memory Wall is the fundamental bottleneck where GPU-based systems exhaust their memory budget trying to run large models; CoE solves this by dynamically composing smaller experts, but optimizing which experts to compose, when, and in what configuration is a deeply data-driven problem. As a Data Scientist, you are the analytical Agentic Orchestrator — you analyze inference patterns, model expert selection heuristics, and build the quantitative frameworks that determine how multiple AI experts work together. You provide the empirical evidence that CoE outperforms GPU-based inference at scale, and your analyses directly shape product roadmap and engineering priorities. This requires a rare blend of statistical rigor, ML systems understanding, and hardware-aware performance modeling. The 20–30% Agentic Orchestrator premium is justified because data scientists who can reason about memory bandwidth, expert composition patterns, and inference optimization simultaneously are virtually non-existent. SambaNova's late-stage equity (~$5B valuation) adds asymmetric upside to an already compelling analytical challenge.

**Global Levers**

1. **Inference Analytics Expertise:** "I specialize in analyzing large-scale inference systems — understanding latency distributions, memory utilization patterns, and model performance trade-offs. This is exactly the analytical muscle CoE needs."
2. **Pre-IPO Data-Driven Decisions:** "My analyses will directly inform whether CoE configurations meet enterprise SLAs. Data-driven decisions during the pre-IPO window determine product quality and customer retention."
3. **Memory Wall Quantification:** "I can build the benchmarking frameworks that empirically demonstrate CoE's superiority over GPU-based inference — the quantitative evidence SambaNova needs for enterprise sales and investor presentations."
4. **FAANG DS Benchmark:** "I'm evaluating a Data Scientist offer from [Google/Meta] at $265K–$295K fully liquid TC. The equity needs to compensate for both illiquidity risk and the Agentic Orchestrator premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the analytical challenges of optimizing CoE composition — this is the most interesting inference optimization problem in the industry. My competing offer is $280K total comp from a public company. Given the liquidity discount and my ability to build the performance analytics that prove CoE's value, I'd like to target $175K base with a $58K equity grant (at current 409A), bringing total comp to approximately $250K–$258K. My accept-at floor is $155K base + $40K equity ($210K total comp) — below that threshold, the risk-adjusted return doesn't justify leaving a liquid alternative. The Agentic Orchestrator premium reflects my ability to analytically optimize how AI experts are composed and orchestrated at scale."
