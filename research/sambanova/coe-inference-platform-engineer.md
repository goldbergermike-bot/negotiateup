**Negotiation DNA**

The CoE Inference Platform Engineer is SambaNova's **SIGNATURE ROLE** — the engineer who directly builds, optimizes, and scales the Composition of Experts inference platform that is the company's entire reason for existing. This is not a supporting function; this is the core technical position that determines whether SambaNova's ~$5B valuation is justified. CoE Inference Platform Engineers design the runtime orchestration layer that dynamically composes expert models, manage memory allocation across SN40L reconfigurable dataflow units, and optimize inference latency and throughput at scales that GPU-based architectures cannot achieve. Levels.fyi and Glassdoor (2025–2026) report that this highly specialized role commands base salaries of $198K–$262K in the Bay Area, with equity grants that are among the largest individual contributor grants at the company — reflecting the existential importance of this role to SambaNova's technical and commercial success.

**Composition of Experts — The Agentic Orchestrator Premium**

This is the role where the Agentic Orchestrator Premium is not just justified — it is the defining characteristic of the position. The CoE Inference Platform Engineer is the Agentic Orchestrator in its purest, most literal form. You build the system that orchestrates multiple AI experts working together to solve the Memory Wall — the fundamental bottleneck where GPU-based architectures run out of memory trying to run large-scale AI models.

Here is what you do, and why it commands the highest premium at SambaNova:

**You solve the Memory Wall.** GPU-based inference systems hit a hard physical limit: the model doesn't fit in memory. The industry's response has been to buy more GPUs and shard the model — expensive, power-hungry, and architecturally inelegant. SambaNova's response is CoE: dynamically compose smaller, specialized expert models into larger inference systems that run on purpose-built SN40L hardware with reconfigurable dataflow architecture. You build this composition system.

**You orchestrate AI experts.** You design and implement the runtime that selects which expert models to invoke for each inference request, loads them into SN40L memory, manages their execution across reconfigurable dataflow units, aggregates their outputs, and optimizes the entire pipeline for sub-100ms latency at enterprise scale. This is the hardest systems engineering problem in AI infrastructure.

**You define a new engineering discipline.** The CoE Inference Platform Engineer role doesn't exist at any other company. NVIDIA doesn't have it (they don't do multi-expert composition). Google doesn't have it (they run monolithic models on TPUs). OpenAI doesn't have it (they're a model company, not a platform company). You are inventing the engineering practices, abstractions, and performance benchmarks for a category of work that has never existed before.

The +25-35% CoE Premium and +30% Agentic Orchestrator Premium stack and are non-negotiable from SambaNova's perspective. There are perhaps 50–100 engineers in the world who could do this job — engineers who understand reconfigurable dataflow hardware, multi-model composition theory, memory-aware scheduling, and production inference optimization simultaneously. SambaNova must pay at the absolute top of their band to attract this talent.

Combined with late-stage startup equity (~$5B valuation with credible IPO path), this role has the potential to be the highest-ROI engineering position in AI infrastructure over the next 4 years. If SambaNova's IPO materializes at $8B–$15B (a reasonable 1.6x–3x from current valuation), the equity component of this package could multiply 2–4x, creating total 4-year compensation that rivals or exceeds Staff+ FAANG packages.

**Global Levers**

1. **Category-Defining Scarcity:** "This role doesn't exist at any other company. I'm not comparing to GPU inference engineers — I'm the person who builds multi-expert orchestration at the hardware-software boundary. The talent pool for this is measured in dozens, not thousands."
2. **Stacked Premium — CoE + Agentic Orchestrator:** "I command both the +25-35% CoE Premium for deep platform expertise and the +30% Agentic Orchestrator Premium for building the core orchestration layer. These premiums stack because the role requires both — separately scarce, together almost non-existent."
3. **Existential Role Impact:** "SambaNova's valuation is built on CoE working at production scale. I'm the engineer who makes that happen. My compensation should reflect the fact that if I don't join, SambaNova needs to find one of the other ~50 people in the world who can do this."
4. **Pre-IPO Equity Multiplier:** "At ~$5B valuation with a credible $8B–$15B IPO trajectory, my equity grant has 2–4x upside. But I need the grant size to reflect the SIGNATURE nature of this role — top 1% of IC grants at the company."
5. **FAANG/NVIDIA Counter-Offer:** "I'm evaluating a Staff-level offer from [NVIDIA/Google] at $450K–$520K fully liquid TC. I'm willing to take the liquidity risk because I believe in CoE, but the equity grant must be sized to make the 4-year math work — I need to see a credible path to $1.5M–$2M+ in total 4-year compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "This is the role I've been waiting for — building the CoE inference platform is the most consequential systems engineering challenge in AI. I want to be direct: I'm holding a Staff-level offer at $490K total comp from a public company with fully liquid RSUs. I understand the startup trade-off and I'm choosing SambaNova because CoE is the right technical bet. But the compensation needs to reflect three realities: (1) this is SambaNova's SIGNATURE engineering role, (2) there are fewer than 100 engineers globally who can do this, and (3) I'm absorbing significant liquidity risk. I'm targeting $250K base with a $95K equity grant (at current 409A valuation), bringing total comp to approximately $370K–$378K. I'd also like to discuss a signing bonus of $30K–$50K to offset the liquidity gap in year one. My accept-at floor is $220K base + $70K equity ($310K total comp) — below that, the risk-adjusted math doesn't work against my liquid alternative. I want the equity to be in the top 1% of IC grants at SambaNova, with a 4-year refresh commitment in writing. The stacked CoE + Agentic Orchestrator premiums are justified because I am literally building the system that justifies SambaNova's valuation."
