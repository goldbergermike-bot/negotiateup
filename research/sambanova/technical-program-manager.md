### Technical Program Manager | SambaNova Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | AI Inference Hardware | Composition of Experts Architecture | +20% Agentic Orchestrator Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Palo Alto | $135K–$172K | $25K–$48K | 10–15% | $175K–$242K |
| Austin | $120K–$155K | $20K–$40K | 10–15% | $155K–$215K |
| Remote US | $115K–$148K | $18K–$36K | 10–15% | $148K–$205K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at SambaNova coordinate the cross-functional execution of the Composition of Experts (CoE) platform — spanning hardware, compiler, runtime, and application layers to deliver integrated AI inference solutions to enterprise customers. At a ~$5B valuation, SambaNova's ability to ship on schedule and at quality is a TPM-driven outcome, making this role essential to the pre-IPO execution narrative. Levels.fyi and Glassdoor (2025–2026) report TPM base salaries at SambaNova in the $135K–$172K range in the Bay Area, with equity grants reflecting the program-level impact that TPMs have on the company's shipping cadence.

**Level Mapping:** SambaNova TPM ~ Google TPM (L5) | Meta TPM (IC5) | Amazon TPM III | Apple TPM | Microsoft TPM (63–65)

**Composition of Experts — The Agentic Orchestrator Premium**

SambaNova's CoE architecture spans the full stack — from custom silicon (SN40L) to compiler optimizations to runtime orchestration to customer-facing APIs — and shipping a coherent product requires a TPM who understands all these layers and can coordinate across them. The Memory Wall is the fundamental bottleneck where GPU-based systems run out of memory trying to serve large models; CoE solves this by dynamically composing smaller expert models, but the engineering program to build this touches hardware design, firmware, compiler backends, runtime systems, and enterprise deployment. As a Technical Program Manager, you are the programmatic Agentic Orchestrator — you don't just track Jira tickets, you orchestrate the execution of teams that are building the orchestration layer for AI experts. You manage the dependencies between silicon tape-outs, compiler releases, runtime feature drops, and customer deployments, ensuring that CoE ships as an integrated system rather than disconnected components. This full-stack program management in AI hardware is a discipline that barely exists outside of NVIDIA, Intel, and SambaNova — and the CoE dimension adds a layer of complexity that is unique to SambaNova. The 20–30% Agentic Orchestrator premium reflects this scarcity. Late-stage equity upside (~$5B valuation) compounds the case, especially since TPM execution quality directly impacts the company's ability to hit IPO milestones.

**Global Levers**

1. **Full-Stack Program Scope:** "I manage programs that span hardware, compiler, runtime, and customer deployment — this is the broadest program scope in AI infrastructure, and it requires both technical depth and cross-functional leadership."
2. **Pre-IPO Execution Leverage:** "SambaNova's IPO timeline depends on shipping milestones being hit. My program management directly determines whether the company meets the execution bar investors expect."
3. **Hardware-Software Coordination:** "I have direct experience coordinating programs that bridge hardware and software — silicon tape-out schedules, compiler release trains, and customer deployment timelines. This cross-layer expertise is rare."
4. **FAANG TPM Benchmark:** "I'm evaluating a TPM offer from [Google/Amazon] at $242K–$270K fully liquid TC. The equity grant needs to compensate for illiquidity and the unique full-stack program complexity at SambaNova."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm drawn to the program management challenge of shipping CoE as an integrated hardware-software product — this is the most complex TPM scope in AI. My competing offer is $258K total comp from a public company with liquid RSUs. Given the liquidity discount and the full-stack program complexity I'd be managing, I'd like to target $165K base with a $52K equity grant (at current 409A), bringing total comp to approximately $235K–$242K. My accept-at floor is $148K base + $38K equity ($198K total comp) — below that, the risk premium doesn't justify the liquidity trade-off. The Agentic Orchestrator premium is justified because I'm orchestrating the human programs that build the AI orchestration platform — meta-orchestration at its most consequential."
