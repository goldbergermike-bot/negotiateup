**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at SambaNova are the technical backbone of the inference platform — they own the design and implementation of critical subsystems within the CoE stack, from expert model routing to memory-efficient scheduling on the SN40L architecture. At a ~$5B valuation, SambaNova competes directly with FAANG Senior SWE offers ($280K–$380K TC at Google/Meta), but compensates with substantial pre-IPO equity that could appreciate significantly through an IPO or strategic exit. According to Levels.fyi and Glassdoor (2025–2026), Senior SWE base salaries at SambaNova range $170K–$220K in the Bay Area, with equity grants designed to close the gap to FAANG total comp once liquidity events are factored.

**Composition of Experts — The Agentic Orchestrator Premium**

SambaNova's Composition of Experts architecture fundamentally redefines inference — instead of cramming one massive model onto memory-limited GPUs, CoE dynamically composes smaller, specialized expert models into orchestrated systems that run on SambaNova's purpose-built hardware. As a Senior Software Engineer, you are the Agentic Orchestrator who designs how these expert models are selected, loaded, composed, and executed in real-time. You solve the Memory Wall — the bottleneck where GPU architectures run out of memory trying to serve large-scale models — by building software that intelligently routes inference requests across a constellation of experts. This is the hardest systems problem in AI infrastructure today, and engineers who can solve it are extraordinarily scarce. The 20–30% Agentic Orchestrator premium is justified because no other company offers this architectural paradigm; your skills are being forged in a domain that doesn't exist elsewhere. Couple this with SambaNova's late-stage equity upside (~$5B valuation, credible IPO trajectory), and the compensation package has meaningful asymmetric return potential.

**Global Levers**

1. **Memory Wall Expertise:** "I've designed systems that operate under extreme memory constraints — precisely the problem CoE solves at the hardware-software boundary. This experience is directly transferable and highly scarce."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "SambaNova's ~$5B valuation suggests significant room for equity appreciation. I'd like my option grant to reflect both the upside potential and the liquidity risk I'm absorbing versus a public-company offer."
3. **Agentic Orchestrator Scarcity:** "Multi-model orchestration at the inference layer is a discipline that barely exists outside SambaNova. I can contribute from day one, but this expertise commands a premium — the market can't easily replace me."
4. **FAANG Counter-Offer Leverage:** "I have a standing offer from [Google/Meta/NVIDIA] at $310K–$340K fully liquid TC. I'm willing to accept a lower liquid component if the equity grant reflects a meaningful premium for illiquidity and the Agentic Orchestrator role I'd play."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply aligned with SambaNova's mission to break through the Memory Wall with CoE. I'm currently evaluating a $320K total comp offer from a public company with fully liquid RSUs. Given the liquidity discount on pre-IPO equity, I'd like to target $205K base with an $80K equity grant (at current 409A valuation), bringing total comp to approximately $295K–$305K. My accept-at floor is $185K base + $55K equity ($255K total comp) — below that threshold, the risk-adjusted return doesn't justify leaving a liquid alternative. The 25% Agentic Orchestrator premium reflects the scarcity of engineers who can design CoE orchestration systems, and I believe SambaNova recognizes this market reality."
