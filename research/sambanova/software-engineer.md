### Software Engineer | SambaNova Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | AI Inference Hardware | Composition of Experts Architecture | +20% Agentic Orchestrator Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Palo Alto | $130K–$165K | $25K–$45K | 10–15% | $162K–$225K |
| Austin | $115K–$148K | $20K–$38K | 10–15% | $142K–$198K |
| Remote US | $110K–$140K | $18K–$35K | 10–15% | $135K–$188K |

**Negotiation DNA**

SambaNova Systems is building the defining AI inference hardware platform, and Software Engineers are foundational to the entire stack — from the SN40L reconfigurable dataflow architecture to the software layers that enable Composition of Experts (CoE) model orchestration. At a ~$5B valuation late-stage startup, Software Engineers who understand how to break through the Memory Wall have asymmetric upside: pre-IPO equity grants today could multiply 3–5x at a successful public offering. Levels.fyi and Glassdoor (2025–2026) report SambaNova base salaries for SWEs ranging $130K–$165K in the Bay Area, with total compensation packages competitive with mid-level FAANG offers once equity appreciation is factored in.

**Composition of Experts — The Agentic Orchestrator Premium**

SambaNova's CoE architecture is the company's core differentiator — it solves the Memory Wall problem by dynamically composing smaller expert models into larger inference systems, enabling workloads that GPU-based architectures simply cannot serve. As a Software Engineer, you are building the orchestration layer that routes queries to the right expert models, manages memory allocation across the SN40L's reconfigurable dataflow units, and ensures sub-millisecond latency at scale. Frame yourself as an "Agentic Orchestrator" — you don't just write code, you build the systems that allow multiple AI experts to work together seamlessly, solving the most fundamental bottleneck in enterprise AI inference. This CoE expertise is virtually non-transferable from GPU-centric companies, which means SambaNova must pay a 20–30% Agentic Orchestrator premium to attract and retain engineers who can build these multi-expert orchestration pipelines. Combined with SambaNova's late-stage startup equity upside (~$5B valuation with credible IPO path), this premium is your strongest negotiation lever.

**Global Levers**

1. **Memory Wall Scarcity:** "I bring direct experience architecting systems that bypass memory bandwidth constraints — the exact bottleneck CoE is designed to solve. This expertise doesn't exist at GPU-first companies."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Timing:** "At SambaNova's current ~$5B valuation, my equity grant has significant upside to a public offering. I'd like the option pool to reflect the risk I'm taking by joining pre-IPO versus a liquid FAANG offer."
3. **CoE Orchestration Depth:** "I understand multi-model orchestration patterns — routing, memory management, and expert composition — that are unique to SambaNova's architecture. This warrants an Agentic Orchestrator premium."
4. **Competing Offer Benchmark:** "I'm currently evaluating offers from [NVIDIA/Google/Amazon] at $185K–$210K total comp with fully liquid equity. To offset SambaNova's liquidity discount, I'd need the equity grant to be meaningfully higher."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm very excited about SambaNova's CoE platform and the Memory Wall problem space. I'm currently holding a competing offer at $195K total comp from a public company with liquid RSUs. Given the liquidity discount on SambaNova equity and my directly relevant orchestration experience, I'd like to target $180K base with a $50K equity grant (valued at current 409A), bringing total comp to approximately $215K–$225K. My accept-at floor is $165K base + $35K equity ($200K total comp) — below that, the liquidity risk doesn't pencil out against my alternative. I believe the Agentic Orchestrator premium is justified given how rare CoE-relevant skills are in the market."
