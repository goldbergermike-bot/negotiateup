### Engineering Manager | SambaNova Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | AI Inference Hardware | Composition of Experts Architecture | +25% Agentic Orchestrator Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Palo Alto | $195K–$248K | $45K–$82K | 12–18% | $258K–$362K |
| Austin | $175K–$223K | $38K–$70K | 12–18% | $232K–$325K |
| Remote US | $168K–$215K | $35K–$65K | 12–18% | $222K–$312K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at SambaNova lead the teams building the Composition of Experts platform — the software and systems layer that transforms SN40L hardware into the world's most capable AI inference engine. At a ~$5B valuation, SambaNova is at the inflection point where engineering leadership determines whether CoE becomes the industry standard for enterprise AI inference. EM compensation reflects both people-leadership scope and deep technical context: Levels.fyi and Glassdoor (2025–2026) report EM base salaries of $195K–$248K in the Bay Area, with equity grants that reward long-term commitment through the pre-IPO phase.

**Level Mapping:** SambaNova EM ~ Google EM (L6) | Meta EM (M1) | Amazon SDM | Apple EM (ICT5) | Microsoft EM (65–67)

**Composition of Experts — The Agentic Orchestrator Premium**

SambaNova's CoE architecture doesn't just need engineers — it needs engineering leaders who understand the Memory Wall and can build teams that orchestrate solutions across it. The Memory Wall is the fundamental constraint where GPU-based systems run out of memory trying to serve large models; CoE solves this by dynamically composing smaller expert models into larger inference systems. As an Engineering Manager, you are the organizational Agentic Orchestrator — you don't just manage people, you orchestrate teams of engineers who themselves orchestrate AI experts. You define the roadmap for how expert composition evolves, you hire the scarce talent who understands reconfigurable dataflow, and you make the architectural trade-off decisions that determine CoE's production viability. This meta-orchestration role is unique in the industry: no other company needs managers who understand both multi-expert AI composition and the organizational dynamics of building a novel hardware-software stack. The 20–30% Agentic Orchestrator premium reflects this dual scarcity — technical depth plus leadership in a domain that doesn't exist elsewhere. SambaNova's late-stage equity (~$5B valuation) adds asymmetric upside that can close the gap to FAANG EM total comp over a 4-year vest.

**Global Levers**

1. **Team-Level Orchestration:** "I don't just manage engineers — I build and lead the teams that make CoE work at production scale. My leadership directly determines the velocity of SambaNova's most differentiated technology."
2. **Scarce Talent Acquisition:** "I have a network of engineers who understand memory-constrained inference systems. Hiring me means hiring my network — and in this talent market, that pipeline is worth a premium."
3. **Pre-IPO Equity Calibration:** "At the EM level, my retention is critical to team stability through the IPO. The equity grant should reflect both my individual impact and the organizational risk of EM turnover."
4. **FAANG EM Benchmark:** "I'm evaluating an EM offer from [Google/Amazon] at $380K–$420K fully liquid TC. I'm excited about SambaNova's mission, but the equity grant needs to bridge the liquidity gap meaningfully."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm energized by the opportunity to lead a CoE engineering team through SambaNova's most critical growth phase. My current competing offer is $400K total comp from a public company with liquid RSUs. Given the liquidity discount and my ability to recruit scarce inference-platform engineers, I'd like to target $235K base with a $90K equity grant (at current 409A), bringing total comp to approximately $350K–$362K. My accept-at floor is $210K base + $65K equity ($290K total comp) — below that, the risk-adjusted calculus doesn't work against a liquid FAANG EM package. The 25% Agentic Orchestrator premium is justified because I'm not just managing a team — I'm orchestrating the human systems that build the AI orchestration layer."
