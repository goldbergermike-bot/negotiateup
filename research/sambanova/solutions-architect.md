### Solutions Architect | SambaNova Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | AI Inference Hardware | Composition of Experts Architecture | +20% Agentic Orchestrator Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Palo Alto | $142K–$185K | $28K–$50K | 10–15% | $185K–$258K |
| Austin | $128K–$165K | $23K–$42K | 10–15% | $165K–$228K |
| Remote US | $122K–$158K | $20K–$38K | 10–15% | $155K–$215K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at SambaNova are the technical bridge between the Composition of Experts (CoE) platform and enterprise customers — they design bespoke inference architectures, run proof-of-concept deployments, and ensure customers extract maximum value from SambaNova's hardware and software stack. At a ~$5B valuation, SambaNova's enterprise revenue growth depends directly on Solutions Architects who can credibly demonstrate CoE's superiority over GPU-based alternatives. Levels.fyi and Glassdoor (2025–2026) report Solutions Architect base salaries at SambaNova in the $142K–$185K range in the Bay Area, with pre-IPO equity reflecting the revenue-generating impact of the role.

**Composition of Experts — The Agentic Orchestrator Premium**

SambaNova's CoE architecture is the centerpiece of every customer engagement — and Solutions Architects are the ones who demonstrate, configure, and optimize it for each enterprise use case. The Memory Wall is the fundamental bottleneck where GPU-based systems run out of memory trying to run large models; CoE solves this by dynamically composing smaller expert models into larger inference systems that run on SambaNova's purpose-built SN40L hardware. As a Solutions Architect, you are the customer-facing Agentic Orchestrator — you design how multiple AI experts are composed for each customer's specific workload, demonstrate that CoE delivers superior latency and throughput versus GPU alternatives, and architect production deployments that solve the Memory Wall for real enterprise use cases. This requires deep technical knowledge of both CoE and the competitive GPU landscape (NVIDIA A100/H100/B200, cloud inference APIs), combined with enterprise consulting skills. The 20–30% Agentic Orchestrator premium is justified because Solutions Architects who can architect multi-expert inference deployments and credibly counter GPU-based objections are extraordinarily rare — you're part salesperson, part systems architect, part AI expert. SambaNova's late-stage equity (~$5B valuation) adds meaningful upside, especially since SAs directly drive the enterprise revenue that determines IPO valuation.

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue-Attached Impact:** "My work directly generates enterprise revenue — every proof-of-concept I close translates to a multi-year platform contract. My compensation should reflect this revenue attachment."
2. **Competitive Intelligence:** "I bring deep knowledge of the GPU inference landscape — NVIDIA's roadmap, cloud inference pricing, alternative architectures — which I use to position CoE as the superior solution."
3. **Pre-IPO Customer Wins:** "Enterprise customer logos won during the pre-IPO phase directly drive IPO valuation. My equity should reflect the fact that each customer I land increases the value of everyone's shares."
4. **FAANG/NVIDIA SA Benchmark:** "I'm evaluating a Solutions Architect offer from [NVIDIA/Amazon] at $260K–$290K fully liquid TC. The equity grant needs to bridge the liquidity gap and reflect the Agentic Orchestrator premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about positioning CoE against GPU-based alternatives in enterprise accounts — I know this competitive landscape intimately. My competing offer is $275K total comp from a public company with liquid RSUs. Given the liquidity discount and my direct revenue impact, I'd like to target $175K base with a $55K equity grant (at current 409A), bringing total comp to approximately $248K–$258K. My accept-at floor is $155K base + $40K equity ($210K total comp) — below that, the risk premium isn't justified against a liquid alternative. The Agentic Orchestrator premium reflects my ability to architect multi-expert inference solutions for enterprise customers and close deals that directly drive SambaNova's IPO narrative."
