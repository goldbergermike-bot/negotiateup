### Data Engineer | SambaNova Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | AI Inference Hardware | Composition of Experts Architecture | +20% Agentic Orchestrator Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Palo Alto | $135K–$175K | $25K–$48K | 10–15% | $175K–$245K |
| Austin | $120K–$158K | $20K–$40K | 10–15% | $155K–$218K |
| Remote US | $115K–$150K | $18K–$36K | 10–15% | $148K–$208K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at SambaNova build the data pipelines, storage systems, and processing infrastructure that power the Composition of Experts (CoE) platform — from training data ingestion to inference telemetry to customer analytics. At a ~$5B valuation, SambaNova is scaling its data infrastructure to support enterprise deployments that generate massive volumes of inference data, model performance metrics, and expert composition telemetry. Levels.fyi and Glassdoor (2025–2026) report Data Engineer base salaries at SambaNova in the $135K–$175K range in the Bay Area, with pre-IPO equity that rewards engineers who build the data backbone of the inference platform.

**Composition of Experts — The Agentic Orchestrator Premium**

SambaNova's CoE architecture generates data at a scale and complexity that GPU-based inference systems simply don't produce. The Memory Wall — the fundamental bottleneck where GPU-based systems run out of memory trying to serve large models — is solved by CoE through dynamic composition of smaller expert models, but this composition creates entirely new data challenges: tracking which experts were composed for each inference request, measuring latency and throughput across expert combinations, managing the lifecycle data of hundreds of expert models, and building the feedback loops that optimize expert selection over time. As a Data Engineer, you are the data-layer Agentic Orchestrator — you build the pipelines that capture, process, and serve the telemetry data that makes expert composition intelligent and adaptive. Without your data infrastructure, CoE would be flying blind — composing experts without knowing which compositions work best. This CoE-specific data engineering is a discipline that doesn't exist at GPU-centric companies, and the 20–30% Agentic Orchestrator premium reflects the fact that SambaNova needs data engineers who can think in terms of expert composition graphs, not just standard ETL. Late-stage equity upside (~$5B valuation) provides meaningful financial optionality on top of this premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **CoE Telemetry Infrastructure:** "I build the data pipelines that make expert composition intelligent — capturing inference telemetry, measuring expert performance, and feeding optimization loops. Without this, CoE can't improve."
2. **Pre-IPO Data Platform Scale:** "Enterprise deployments generate massive inference data volumes. The data platform I build today determines whether SambaNova can scale to the customer count IPO investors expect."
3. **Expert Composition Analytics:** "I design data systems that track multi-expert composition patterns — which experts are composed, how they perform, and how to optimize selection. This is a data engineering discipline unique to SambaNova."
4. **FAANG Data Engineer Benchmark:** "I'm evaluating a Data Engineer offer from [Google/Meta] at $245K–$275K fully liquid TC. The equity needs to bridge the liquidity gap and reflect CoE-specific data engineering complexity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building the data infrastructure that makes CoE composition intelligent — this is the most architecturally novel data engineering challenge in AI. My competing offer is $260K total comp from a public company with liquid RSUs. Given the liquidity discount and the CoE-specific data challenges I'd be solving, I'd like to target $168K base with a $52K equity grant (at current 409A), bringing total comp to approximately $238K–$245K. My accept-at floor is $148K base + $38K equity ($198K total comp) — below that, the risk premium doesn't justify leaving a liquid alternative. The Agentic Orchestrator premium is justified because I'm building the data pipelines that orchestrate how inference telemetry flows through the expert composition system — enabling the intelligence behind the orchestration."
