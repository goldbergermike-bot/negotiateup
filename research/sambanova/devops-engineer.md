**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at SambaNova build and maintain the infrastructure that deploys, scales, and monitors the Composition of Experts (CoE) inference platform across enterprise environments. At a ~$5B valuation, SambaNova is scaling from R&D deployments to production enterprise workloads, making DevOps a critical function that directly impacts customer reliability and revenue. Levels.fyi and Glassdoor (2025–2026) report DevOps Engineer base salaries at SambaNova in the $135K–$172K range in the Bay Area, with pre-IPO equity that rewards infrastructure engineers who ensure the platform operates at enterprise-grade reliability.

**Composition of Experts — The Agentic Orchestrator Premium**

SambaNova's CoE architecture requires a fundamentally different DevOps paradigm. Unlike GPU clusters where you deploy a single large model, CoE dynamically composes multiple smaller expert models into orchestrated inference systems — and the infrastructure that supports this must handle dynamic model loading, expert routing, memory allocation across SN40L nodes, and real-time recomposition as workload patterns shift. The Memory Wall — where GPU-based systems run out of memory trying to serve large models — is solved by CoE at the architecture level, but it creates new infrastructure challenges at the deployment level. As a DevOps Engineer, you are the infrastructure Agentic Orchestrator — you build the CI/CD pipelines, monitoring systems, and deployment automation that keep multiple AI experts running in concert across distributed SambaNova hardware. This is not standard Kubernetes-on-GPUs DevOps; it requires understanding reconfigurable dataflow deployment patterns, expert model lifecycle management, and memory-aware scheduling. The 20–30% Agentic Orchestrator premium is justified because DevOps engineers who understand CoE deployment are a category that barely exists — SambaNova is creating this discipline from scratch. Late-stage equity upside (~$5B valuation) compounds the financial case for joining at this stage.

**Global Levers**

1. **CoE Infrastructure Expertise:** "Deploying and managing multi-expert inference systems requires fundamentally different infrastructure patterns than GPU-based ML ops. I bring the systems thinking to build this from the ground up."
2. **Pre-IPO Reliability Impact:** "Enterprise customers evaluate SambaNova based on uptime and reliability. My work directly determines whether enterprise contracts close and renew — that's IPO-grade impact."
3. **Inference Platform Operations:** "I understand the operational requirements of AI inference at scale — latency budgets, memory monitoring, model lifecycle management — not just generic cloud infrastructure."
4. **FAANG SRE Benchmark:** "I'm evaluating an SRE offer from [Google/Amazon] at $240K–$270K fully liquid TC. The equity needs to compensate for illiquidity and the specialized CoE deployment skills I bring."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm drawn to the infrastructure challenge of operationalizing CoE at enterprise scale — this is the most novel DevOps problem in AI today. My competing offer is $255K total comp from a public company with liquid RSUs. Given the liquidity discount and my ability to build the deployment infrastructure for multi-expert orchestration, I'd like to target $165K base with a $52K equity grant (at current 409A), bringing total comp to approximately $235K–$242K. My accept-at floor is $148K base + $38K equity ($198K total comp) — below that, the risk premium isn't sufficient. The Agentic Orchestrator premium is justified because I'm not doing standard DevOps — I'm building the infrastructure that orchestrates AI expert deployment at a scale GPU-based platforms can't reach."
