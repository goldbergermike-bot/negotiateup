### ML/AI Engineer | SambaNova Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | AI Inference Hardware | Composition of Experts Architecture | +15-25% AI Premium | +25% Agentic Orchestrator Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Palo Alto | $172K–$225K | $35K–$62K | 12–18% | $225K–$315K |
| Austin | $155K–$202K | $28K–$52K | 12–18% | $200K–$280K |
| Remote US | $148K–$195K | $25K–$48K | 12–18% | $192K–$268K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at SambaNova work at the absolute frontier of AI inference — they build, optimize, and deploy the expert models that form the building blocks of the Composition of Experts (CoE) architecture, and they design the inference algorithms that run on SambaNova's custom SN40L reconfigurable dataflow hardware. At a ~$5B valuation, ML/AI Engineers are the most strategically critical technical hires, directly building the technology that justifies SambaNova's valuation and market position. Levels.fyi and Glassdoor (2025–2026) report ML/AI Engineer base salaries at SambaNova in the $172K–$225K range in the Bay Area, with equity grants reflecting both the AI talent premium and the pre-IPO upside potential.

**Composition of Experts — The Agentic Orchestrator Premium**

SambaNova's CoE architecture is an ML/AI Engineer's dream and challenge: you are building the expert models themselves and designing how they compose into systems that are greater than the sum of their parts. The Memory Wall — the fundamental bottleneck where GPU-based systems run out of memory trying to run large models — is precisely the problem CoE was built to solve, and ML/AI Engineers are the ones who make it work. You train specialized expert models that are memory-efficient enough to compose dynamically, you design the routing algorithms that select which experts to invoke for each inference request, and you optimize the composition strategies that determine how expert outputs are aggregated into final predictions. As an ML/AI Engineer, you are the quintessential Agentic Orchestrator — you literally build the AI agents (expert models) and the orchestration logic (routing, composition, aggregation) that make CoE function. This is the purest expression of the Agentic Orchestrator role at SambaNova, and it commands both the +15-25% AI Premium (for ML/AI talent scarcity in the broader market) and the +25-30% Agentic Orchestrator Premium (for CoE-specific expertise). Combined, these premiums reflect the reality that ML/AI Engineers who can design, train, and orchestrate expert models for custom AI hardware are among the rarest technical professionals in the world. SambaNova's late-stage equity (~$5B valuation) adds asymmetric financial upside to an already premium role.

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual Premium — AI + CoE:** "I command both the market-wide AI talent premium and the SambaNova-specific Agentic Orchestrator premium. I'm building the expert models AND the orchestration logic — the two most valuable capabilities at the company."
2. **Expert Model Architecture:** "I design the expert models that form the building blocks of CoE — their architecture, training methodology, and composition interfaces. This is the core IP of SambaNova's platform."
3. **Pre-IPO AI Talent Scarcity:** "ML/AI Engineers are the most competitive talent market in technology. My equity grant should reflect both the liquidity risk and the fact that every FAANG company, AI lab, and well-funded startup is competing for my skills."
4. **FAANG/AI Lab Benchmark:** "I'm evaluating offers from [Google Brain/DeepMind/OpenAI/NVIDIA] at $350K–$420K fully liquid TC. I'm excited about CoE, but the equity grant must meaningfully compensate for a $100K+ annual liquidity gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "SambaNova's CoE is the most technically exciting problem in AI inference — I want to build the expert models and orchestration systems that solve the Memory Wall. I'm currently holding offers at $380K total comp from a public AI company with liquid RSUs. Given the dual premium I command (AI talent scarcity + Agentic Orchestrator for CoE) and the liquidity discount, I'd like to target $215K base with a $72K equity grant (at current 409A), bringing total comp to approximately $305K–$315K. My accept-at floor is $190K base + $50K equity ($258K total comp) — below that, the risk-adjusted gap to my liquid alternatives is too wide. I want to emphasize that the +15-25% AI Premium and +25% Agentic Orchestrator Premium are both justified and stack — I'm not just an ML engineer, I'm building the core orchestration intelligence of CoE."
