**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Alteryx build the predictive analytics, machine learning, and AI capabilities within the Alteryx platform. The Intelligence Suite adds ML and NLP capabilities to Alteryx's visual workflow paradigm, allowing business analysts to build ML models without code. AiDIN is Alteryx's AI-powered analytics assistant. Data scientists at Alteryx have a unique mandate: making ML accessible to non-technical users through visual, no-code interfaces. This "democratization of ML" challenge is harder than building ML for ML engineers. [Source: Alteryx DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Alteryx Senior DS = Dataiku Senior DS = Tableau Senior DS = Google L4 DS

**Global Levers**

1. **ML Democratization Mandate:** "Making ML accessible to business analysts through visual workflows is harder than building ML for ML engineers. I'm solving the usability problem, not just the technical problem."
2. **AiDIN AI Features:** If working on Alteryx's AI assistant, push for AI premium: "I'm building the AI features that compete with Microsoft Copilot and Google Duet AI in the analytics space."
3. **Intelligence Suite Expansion:** If expanding ML capabilities within Alteryx, frame as: "Each ML capability I add to the Intelligence Suite makes Alteryx competitive in a new market segment."
4. **Databricks/Google DS Counter:** Both offer higher comp with liquid equity for DS roles.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $155K over 4 years. I'm solving the hardest challenge in ML — making it accessible to non-technical users — and I have competing offers with liquid equity." Counter at $125K-$145K equity is competitive.
