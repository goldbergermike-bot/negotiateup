**Negotiation DNA**

TPMs at Alteryx coordinate cross-functional programs during the company's most complex transformation — migrating from desktop-first to cloud-native under PE ownership. Key programs include the Analytics Cloud platform migration, Intelligence Suite ML expansion, enterprise security compliance, and infrastructure cost optimization. Under Clearlake's PE ownership, programs are measured against financial metrics (EBITDA, ARR growth), not just technical milestones. TPMs who can drive programs that impact PE valuation metrics are highly valued. [Source: Alteryx TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Alteryx Senior TPM = Dataiku Senior TPM = Google L5 TPM = Salesforce Senior TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **PE-Driven Program Metrics:** "Under PE ownership, my programs are measured against financial metrics — ARR growth, cloud migration rates, and EBITDA improvement. I'm managing programs that directly drive exit valuation."
2. **Cloud Migration Program:** If managing the Analytics Cloud migration, push for premium: "I'm managing the most complex cross-functional program at Alteryx — the cloud platform migration."
3. **Dual-Track Program Management:** "Managing innovation programs (Analytics Cloud, AI) alongside efficiency programs (cost optimization, tech debt) simultaneously requires exceptional program management skills."
4. **Google/Salesforce TPM Counter:** Both offer liquid equity and higher base for TPM roles.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $145K over 4 years with acceleration. My programs directly impact the PE valuation metrics, and I have TPM offers from Google and Salesforce with liquid RSUs." Counter at $115K-$135K equity with acceleration is competitive.
