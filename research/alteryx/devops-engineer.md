**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Alteryx manage the infrastructure for both the legacy desktop platform (Alteryx Server) and the new cloud-native platform (Alteryx Analytics Cloud). This dual-mode infrastructure challenge is significant — supporting on-premise enterprise deployments while building cloud-native infrastructure simultaneously. Clearlake's PE ownership creates operational efficiency pressure, making DevOps cost optimization directly tied to value creation. [Source: Alteryx DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Alteryx Senior DevOps = Dataiku DevOps = Tableau DevOps = Google L4 SRE

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual-Mode Infrastructure:** "Supporting both on-premise Server deployments and cloud-native Analytics Cloud simultaneously is significantly more complex than pure-SaaS infrastructure."
2. **PE Cost Optimization:** "Clearlake's value creation plan depends on infrastructure efficiency. My cost optimization work directly improves EBITDA margins, which drives exit valuation."
3. **Cloud Migration Infrastructure:** If building the Analytics Cloud infrastructure from scratch, push for premium: "I'm building the cloud infrastructure for the company's most important strategic initiative."
4. **Datadog/HashiCorp Counter:** Both offer higher base and more liquid equity for DevOps roles.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $140K over 4 years with acceleration. I'm managing dual-mode infrastructure and my cost optimization directly impacts PE valuation metrics." Counter at $110K-$130K equity with acceleration is acceptable.
