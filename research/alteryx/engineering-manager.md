### Engineering Manager | Alteryx Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private (Clearlake Capital $4.4B) | Analytics Automation Pioneer | Liquidity Risk Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine HQ | $190K–$245K | $110K–$260K | 10-15% | $260K–$390K |
| Remote US | $175K–$230K | $95K–$235K | 10-15% | $240K–$360K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Alteryx lead teams building the analytics automation platform during a critical transformation period. Under Clearlake's PE ownership, EMs face dual mandates: innovating on the Analytics Cloud platform while maintaining operational efficiency on the legacy desktop product. This requires managing teams through a complex technical transition while meeting PE-driven financial metrics. EMs at PE-backed companies should negotiate for management equity participation in addition to standard equity grants. [Source: Alteryx EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Alteryx EM = Dataiku EM = Google L5 Manager = Tableau EM

**Global Levers**

1. **PE Transformation Leadership:** "I'm leading engineering teams through Alteryx's cloud transformation under PE ownership. This dual mandate — innovation + efficiency — is the most complex EM challenge in the analytics space."
2. **Management Equity Pool:** Push for management equity participation: "At PE-backed companies, EMs are part of the leadership team driving exit value. I want management equity pool participation."
3. **IC Parity:** Staff ICs at Alteryx can earn $250K+ in equity. EMs must match: "My equity needs to exceed my Staff ICs for the management role to make sense financially."
4. **Salesforce/Google EM Counter:** Both offer liquid equity and proven EM career paths. Push Alteryx equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $245K over 4 years with acceleration, plus management equity pool participation. I'm leading the cloud transformation under PE ownership, and I have EM offers from Salesforce and Google with liquid equity." Counter at $200K-$230K equity with management equity access is competitive.
