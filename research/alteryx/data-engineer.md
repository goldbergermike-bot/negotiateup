### Data Engineer | Alteryx Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private (Clearlake Capital $4.4B) | Analytics Automation Pioneer | Liquidity Risk Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine HQ | $145K–$200K | $55K–$160K | 10% | $175K–$285K |
| Remote US | $130K–$185K | $45K–$140K | 10% | $160K–$260K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Alteryx build the data connectivity, preparation, and pipeline infrastructure that powers the analytics automation platform. Alteryx connects to hundreds of data sources — databases, cloud warehouses, APIs, files — and the data engineering team ensures these connections are reliable, performant, and scalable. The meta-quality applies: you're a data engineer building a platform used by thousands of other data professionals. Alteryx's cloud migration (Analytics Cloud) requires rebuilding data pipelines for cloud-native architecture. [Source: Alteryx DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Alteryx Senior DE = Dataiku Senior DE = Tableau Senior DE = Google L4 DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Meta-Platform Frame:** "I'm a data engineer building the data platform that other data engineers use. The data engineering standard at Alteryx is inherently higher."
2. **Cloud Migration Data Pipelines:** If working on the Analytics Cloud migration, push for premium: "I'm rebuilding Alteryx's data infrastructure for cloud-native — the company's most important technical initiative."
3. **Connector Ecosystem:** Alteryx's value depends on connecting to hundreds of data sources. Push for premium if working on connectors: "Each connector I build unlocks a new customer segment."
4. **Snowflake/Databricks DE Counter:** Both pay higher with more liquid equity for DE roles.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $150K over 4 years with acceleration. I'm building the data infrastructure for the analytics automation category leader, and I have competing offers from Snowflake and Databricks." Counter at $120K-$140K equity with acceleration is competitive.
