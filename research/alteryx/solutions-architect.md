**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Alteryx design and deploy analytics automation solutions for enterprise customers. SAs help customers design Alteryx workflows, configure Server environments, migrate to Analytics Cloud, and integrate with their data ecosystem (Snowflake, Databricks, cloud warehouses). Alteryx SAs are highly technical — many are former data analysts or data engineers who became platform experts. The community-driven Alteryx ecosystem (Alteryx Community, ACE program) means SAs also contribute to the broader platform knowledge base. [Source: Alteryx SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Alteryx Senior SA = Dataiku SA = Tableau SA = Snowflake SA

**Global Levers**

1. **Cloud Migration Consulting:** "I'm helping enterprise customers migrate from Alteryx Server to Analytics Cloud. This migration consulting drives cloud revenue adoption — the key metric for PE exit valuation."
2. **Data Ecosystem Integration:** "I architect Alteryx deployments that integrate with Snowflake, Databricks, and cloud warehouses. My multi-platform expertise drives customer success and retention."
3. **Community Leadership:** If contributing to the Alteryx Community or ACE program, frame as: "My community leadership drives platform adoption and customer retention at scale."
4. **Snowflake/Databricks SA Counter:** Both pay SAs well with more liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $140K over 4 years with acceleration. My enterprise deployment expertise drives customer adoption and cloud migration revenue, and I have SA offers from Snowflake with liquid RSUs." Counter at $110K-$130K equity with acceleration is acceptable.
