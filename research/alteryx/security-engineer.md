**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Alteryx protect an analytics platform that processes sensitive enterprise data — financial records, customer data, HR information, and strategic business metrics. Alteryx's dual-deployment model (on-premise Server + cloud-native Analytics Cloud) creates a large security surface. The cloud migration introduces new cloud security challenges while the on-premise deployments require continued security support. Under PE ownership, security compliance (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA) is essential for enterprise sales. [Source: Alteryx Security Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Alteryx Senior Security Eng = Dataiku Security Eng = Tableau Security Eng = Salesforce Security Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual-Deployment Security Surface:** "Securing both on-premise and cloud deployments simultaneously is significantly more complex than securing a pure-SaaS platform."
2. **Enterprise Compliance Revenue Enablement:** "SOC2, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance certifications are revenue enablers — without them, Alteryx can't sell to regulated industries. My security work directly unlocks customer segments."
3. **Cloud Migration Security:** If securing the Analytics Cloud migration, push for premium: "I'm defining the security architecture for Alteryx's cloud platform from the ground up."
4. **CrowdStrike/Palo Alto Counter:** Cybersecurity companies offer premium comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $150K over 4 years with acceleration. I'm securing a dual-deployment platform during a cloud migration, and I have offers from cybersecurity companies with liquid equity." Counter at $120K-$140K equity with acceleration is competitive.
