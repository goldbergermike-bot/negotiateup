### Software Engineer | Alteryx Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private (Clearlake Capital $4.4B) | Analytics Automation Pioneer | Liquidity Risk Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine HQ | $135K–$190K | $50K–$150K | 10% | $165K–$270K |
| Remote US | $120K–$175K | $40K–$130K | 10% | $150K–$245K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Alteryx is a private analytics automation company headquartered in Irvine, CA, taken private by Clearlake Capital for $4.4B. SWEs build the Alteryx Designer, Server, and Analytics Cloud platforms that enable no-code/low-code data analytics for enterprise customers. As a PE-backed private company, equity is illiquid — negotiate for a larger grant with acceleration on change of control. Clearlake's typical PE playbook targets exit in 3-5 years (IPO or strategic sale), which provides a rough timeline for liquidity. The 10% cash bonus provides some downside protection.

**Level Mapping:** Alteryx SWE = Dataiku SWE = Tableau SWE = Google L3

**Global Levers**

1. **PE Liquidity Timeline:** "Clearlake's PE playbook targets 3-5 year exits. I need equity terms that protect me across this timeline — acceleration on change of control and extended exercise windows."
2. **Analytics Automation Category:** "Alteryx pioneered analytics process automation. I'm building a category-defining product, not a commodity feature."
3. **Irvine Cost Advantage:** If based in Irvine, note the lower cost of living compared to SF/NYC: "Irvine offers a strong quality of life, but my comp should still reflect the market rate for this role, not a cost-of-living adjustment."
4. **Dataiku/Databricks Counter:** Both offer pre-IPO equity with higher liquidity confidence.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $140K over 4 years with double-trigger acceleration. Clearlake's PE exit timeline gives me confidence in eventual liquidity, but I need protection terms." Counter at $110K-$130K equity with acceleration is acceptable.
