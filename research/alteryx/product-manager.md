### Product Manager | Alteryx Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private (Clearlake Capital $4.4B) | Analytics Automation Pioneer | Liquidity Risk Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine HQ | $150K–$210K | $60K–$170K | 10-15% | $185K–$305K |
| Remote US | $135K–$195K | $50K–$150K | 10-15% | $170K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at Alteryx own the product roadmap for the analytics automation platform during a critical transformation. Under Clearlake's PE ownership, PMs balance innovation (Analytics Cloud, AI features) with operational efficiency (monetization, packaging, retention). Each PM owns a significant product domain: Designer workflow engine, Analytics Cloud, Intelligence Suite, or enterprise administration. The PE context means PM decisions directly impact exit valuation — growth metrics and retention rates drive the multiple Clearlake will achieve on exit. [Source: Alteryx PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Alteryx PM = Dataiku PM = Tableau PM = Google L5 PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Exit Valuation Product Metrics:** "My product decisions directly impact the metrics that drive Alteryx's exit valuation — net revenue retention, expansion revenue, and cloud migration adoption rates."
2. **Cloud Migration Product Strategy:** If owning Analytics Cloud, push for premium: "I'm defining the product strategy for the company's most important strategic transition."
3. **AI/ML Product Roadmap:** If owning Intelligence Suite or AiDIN, push for AI premium: "I'm defining the AI product strategy that competes with Microsoft, Google, and Databricks."
4. **Salesforce/Databricks PM Counter:** Both offer liquid equity and higher base for PM roles.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $160K over 4 years with acceleration. My product decisions directly drive the metrics that determine Clearlake's exit valuation, and I have PM offers with liquid equity." Counter at $130K-$150K equity with acceleration is competitive.
