### Analytics Automation Engineer | Alteryx Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private (Clearlake Capital $4.4B) | Analytics Automation Pioneer | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | Liquidity Risk Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine HQ | $150K–$210K | $65K–$170K | 10% | $185K–$300K |
| Remote US | $135K–$195K | $55K–$150K | 10% | $170K–$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Alteryx's signature engineering role. Analytics Automation Engineers build the core Alteryx Designer and Alteryx Server platform — the no-code/low-code analytics automation tools used by data analysts and business users at Fortune 500 companies. Alteryx was taken private by Clearlake Capital in a $4.4B deal, meaning equity is now private stock with liquidity dependent on a future exit (IPO or sale). Alteryx pioneered the "analytics process automation" category, competing with Dataiku, KNIME, and increasingly Databricks. The platform enables data preparation, blending, spatial analytics, and predictive modeling without writing code. [Source: Alteryx Analytics Automation Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Alteryx Analytics Automation Eng (Senior) = Dataiku Senior SWE = Tableau Senior SWE = Google L4

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Analytics Automation Engineer works across Alteryx's core platform:
- **Alteryx Designer:** Building the visual workflow engine for data preparation and analytics
- **Alteryx Server:** Enterprise-scale workflow execution and scheduling
- **Alteryx Intelligence Suite:** ML and NLP capabilities within the visual workflow paradigm
- **Alteryx Analytics Cloud:** Cloud-native analytics automation platform
- **AiDIN (AI):** Alteryx's AI-powered analytics assistant

**Global Levers**

1. **Category Creator Premium:** "Alteryx created the analytics process automation category. I'm building the platform that defined a market segment — this is category-creator work, not follower work."
2. **PE Equity Upside:** "Clearlake took Alteryx private at $4.4B. Private equity sponsors typically target 2-3x returns in 3-5 years. If Clearlake exits at $8-12B, my equity has significant upside."
3. **Liquidity Risk Premium:** "Private equity means illiquid stock. I need a 25-40% equity premium over what I'd accept from a public company to compensate."
4. **Dataiku/Databricks Counter:** Both compete for the same analytics automation talent. Frame: "Dataiku offers pre-IPO equity with strong venture backing, and Databricks offers near-certain IPO upside."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $290K total comp with equity at $160K over 4 years and acceleration on change of control. This is Alteryx's defining engineering role, and Clearlake's PE playbook suggests an exit within 3-5 years. I have competing offers from Dataiku and Databricks." Counter at $130K-$155K equity with acceleration is competitive.
