### ML / AI Engineer | Alteryx Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private (Clearlake Capital $4.4B) | Analytics Automation Pioneer | **+10–20% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine HQ | $150K–$210K | $60K–$175K | 10% | $185K–$305K |
| Remote US | $135K–$195K | $50K–$155K | 10% | $170K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Alteryx build the Intelligence Suite ML capabilities, AiDIN AI assistant, and the AI-powered features that keep Alteryx competitive against Databricks, Dataiku, and Microsoft. The unique challenge at Alteryx is building ML that works within a visual, no-code workflow paradigm — making sophisticated ML accessible to business analysts. This "ML democratization" engineering is harder than building ML for ML engineers. [Source: Alteryx ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Alteryx ML/AI Eng = Dataiku ML Eng = Google L4 ML = Databricks ML Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **ML Democratization Engineering:** "Building ML that works within a visual no-code workflow is harder than building ML for ML engineers. I'm solving the accessibility problem alongside the technical problem."
2. **AiDIN AI Features:** If working on Alteryx's AI assistant, push for AI premium: "I'm building the AI features that directly compete with Microsoft Copilot and Google's AI analytics tools."
3. **Intelligence Suite Expansion:** "Each ML capability I add to Alteryx unlocks a new customer segment and increases platform stickiness."
4. **Databricks/Google ML Counter:** Both offer higher comp with liquid equity. Push Alteryx equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $165K over 4 years. I'm building ML features that democratize analytics for non-technical users — the hardest ML engineering challenge — and I have competing offers with liquid equity." Counter at $135K-$155K equity is competitive.
