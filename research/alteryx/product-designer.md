Product Designers at Alteryx design the visual workflow experience that defines the analytics automation category. Alteryx's core UX challenge is making complex data operations (blending, spatial analytics, predictive modeling) accessible through drag-and-drop visual workflows. The Analytics Cloud migration requires redesigning the desktop experience for web-native interaction patterns. The design team is small, giving each designer significant product ownership.
