**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Coupa work with one of the most unique and valuable datasets in enterprise software: over $6 trillion in cumulative spend data from 3,000+ global enterprises. Since Thoma Bravo acquired Coupa for $8 billion in 2023, the company has doubled down on AI-powered community intelligence as its primary competitive differentiator. As a Data Scientist, you are the engine behind the insights that transform raw procurement data into autonomous sourcing recommendations, spend benchmarks, and predictive risk analytics that enterprises use to make billion-dollar decisions.

The Autonomous Sourcing initiative depends entirely on the quality of data science work at Coupa. You are building the models that predict supplier performance, detect spend anomalies, recommend optimal vendor diversification strategies, and quantify geopolitical risk across global supply chains. This is not generic data science — the Supply-Chain Resilience domain requires specialized knowledge of procurement economics, tariff structures, and multi-tier supplier networks. The models you build directly inform the autonomous decision engines that are Coupa's strategic future.

From Coupa's San Mateo hub, Data Scientists have access to proprietary spend data that no other company possesses — the aggregated, anonymized transaction data from thousands of the world's largest enterprises. Under Thoma Bravo's PE ownership, the commercialization of this data asset through AI-powered products is a key driver of revenue expansion and exit valuation. Your option grants are tied to this trajectory, and data scientists who build the models that drive community intelligence monetization will be among the highest-value contributors to the exit outcome.

### Sovereign Sourcing — The Supply-Chain Resilience Premium

**Lever 1 — Autonomous Sourcing Model Development:** "Coupa's Autonomous Sourcing platform depends on the predictive models I'll build — supplier scoring, spend optimization, demand forecasting across $6T+ in managed spend. The quality of these models directly determines whether autonomous procurement decisions are trustworthy enough for DHL, Uber, and Salesforce to rely on. This model ownership justifies a base of $200,000, which is competitive for data scientists working on high-stakes autonomous systems."

**Lever 2 — Thoma Bravo Data Monetization Alignment:** "Thoma Bravo's thesis on Coupa centers on monetizing the community intelligence data asset — the proprietary spend data from 3,000+ enterprises. As a Data Scientist building the models that power this monetization, I'm directly driving exit value. I'd like an option grant of 12,000 shares with clear visibility into the current 409A valuation, reflecting my role as a key contributor to the data monetization strategy."

**Lever 3 — Supply-Chain Resilience Risk Modeling:** "The Supply-Chain Resilience models I'll develop — geopolitical risk quantification, tariff impact simulation, sovereign sourcing optimization — are capabilities that enterprises will pay premium pricing for. This specialized domain knowledge in procurement risk analytics, combined with the ability to work with Coupa's proprietary dataset at the San Mateo hub, warrants total compensation in the $340,000 range."

**Lever 4 — Community Intelligence IP Creation:** "Every model I build at Coupa contributes to the AI-powered community intelligence platform — a proprietary IP layer that no competitor can replicate because they lack the underlying spend data. I'm creating durable competitive advantage with each model deployment. I'd like a $20,000 signing bonus and a commitment to conference participation and research publication support, which will also strengthen Coupa's employer brand in the data science community."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $205,000 base with 12,000 options (4yr vest), a 15% target bonus, and a $20,000 signing bonus. Anchor on the unique $6T+ spend dataset, the Autonomous Sourcing model ownership, and the community intelligence monetization thesis. If they counter at $175,000 base with 8,000 options, push for 10,000 options and a $18,000 signing bonus with a guaranteed Year 2 refresh of 3,000 options. Accept-at floor: $170,000 base + 8,000 options + $15,000 signing bonus = ~$255,000 total first-year comp. Below this, competing offers from Snowflake, Databricks, or other data-intensive platforms will be more attractive.
