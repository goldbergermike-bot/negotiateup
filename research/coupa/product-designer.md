**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Coupa are reshaping how procurement professionals interact with the world's most comprehensive Business Spend Management platform. Since Thoma Bravo acquired Coupa for $8 billion in 2023, the company has invested heavily in redesigning the user experience to support Autonomous Sourcing — a paradigm shift where AI-powered systems make procurement decisions that previously required manual human workflows. As a Product Designer, you are translating complex supply chain operations into intuitive interfaces that serve 3,000+ enterprise customers managing over $6 trillion in cumulative spend.

The design challenge at Coupa is uniquely demanding. Unlike consumer-facing products, you are designing for CPOs, procurement directors, and supply chain analysts who need to make high-stakes decisions quickly — evaluating suppliers, routing spend across geographies, and managing sovereign sourcing compliance. Coupa's AI-powered community intelligence layer adds another dimension: you must surface machine-generated insights and autonomous recommendations in ways that build user trust and drive adoption. The Supply-Chain Resilience imperative means your designs must handle complex geopolitical data — tariff impacts, vendor risk scores, multi-source optimization — without overwhelming the user.

Working from Coupa's San Mateo hub, Product Designers collaborate closely with engineering and product management to define the experience layer of the platform. Under Thoma Bravo's ownership, there is a strong emphasis on design efficiency — reducing user friction to drive feature adoption, which directly impacts expansion revenue and retention metrics that matter for the PE exit thesis. Your options are tied to this exit trajectory, and a well-designed product is a key driver of the company's multiple expansion.

### Sovereign Sourcing — The Supply-Chain Resilience Premium

**Lever 1 — Autonomous Sourcing UX Transformation:** "Coupa's Autonomous Sourcing initiative requires a fundamental UX transformation — moving from manual procurement workflows to AI-assisted decision interfaces. Designing trust-calibrated autonomous systems for enterprise users managing $6T+ in spend is design work at the highest level of complexity. I'm targeting a base salary of $175,000, reflecting the specialized nature of this autonomous UX work."

**Lever 2 — Thoma Bravo Adoption Impact:** "In a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, user adoption directly drives expansion revenue and retention — both critical to exit multiples. My design work will directly impact these metrics across 3,000+ enterprise customers. I'd like an option grant of 8,000 shares to align my incentives with the adoption outcomes that drive equity value."

**Lever 3 — Supply-Chain Resilience Information Design:** "The Supply-Chain Resilience capabilities require sophisticated information design — visualizing geopolitical risk, tariff exposure, vendor concentration, and sovereign sourcing compliance in actionable dashboards. This is specialized design work that goes beyond typical SaaS product design. At the San Mateo hub, I'd expect total compensation of $270,000 to reflect this domain complexity."

**Lever 4 — Community Intelligence Visualization:** "Coupa's AI-powered community intelligence is only as valuable as its presentation layer. I'll be designing how anonymized spend benchmarks, predictive analytics, and autonomous recommendations are surfaced to users. I'd like a $15,000 signing bonus and access to Coupa's design conference and tooling budget to ensure I can deliver world-class design for this differentiated capability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $180,000 base with 8,000 options (4yr vest), a $15,000 signing bonus, and a $5,000 annual learning/conference stipend. Anchor on the Autonomous Sourcing UX transformation and the specialized information design required for Supply-Chain Resilience. If they counter at $155,000 base with 5,000 options, negotiate for 7,000 options and a $12,000 signing bonus. Accept-at floor: $150,000 base + 5,000 options + $10,000 signing bonus = ~$210,000 total first-year comp. Below this, senior design roles at Figma, Salesforce, or ServiceNow offer stronger total packages.
