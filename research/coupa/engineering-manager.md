**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Coupa are entrusted with building and leading the teams that execute the company's most critical technical bets. Since Thoma Bravo took Coupa private for $8 billion in 2023, the company has undergone a significant organizational transformation — leaner teams, sharper priorities, and an intensified focus on platform efficiency. As an Engineering Manager, you are simultaneously a people leader, a delivery owner, and a strategic partner to product leadership. Your ability to recruit, retain, and develop engineers directly determines whether Coupa can execute its Autonomous Sourcing roadmap.

Coupa's platform manages over $6 trillion in cumulative spend for 3,000+ enterprise customers, and the Engineering Manager role sits at the intersection of technical execution and business impact. The Supply-Chain Resilience initiative requires teams that can ship quickly, iterate on AI-powered community intelligence features, and maintain the reliability that DHL, Uber, Salesforce, and other global enterprises demand. From the San Mateo hub, you are building teams that operate at the scale of global procurement infrastructure — not a typical SaaS management role.

Under PE ownership, Engineering Managers also carry an implicit responsibility for operational efficiency. Thoma Bravo's playbook emphasizes margin expansion and capital efficiency, which means your management decisions around team size, vendor spend, and build-vs-buy directly impact the company's path to a future exit. Your option grants are priced against the PE valuation, and successful execution on the Autonomous Sourcing reset could drive significant equity appreciation. Negotiate for both a competitive option grant and a clear path to refresh grants tied to team and business outcomes.

### Sovereign Sourcing — The Supply-Chain Resilience Premium

**Lever 1 — Autonomous Sourcing Team Leadership:** "I'll be building and leading the engineering team responsible for Coupa's Autonomous Sourcing platform — the system that automates procurement decisions across $6T+ in managed spend. Recruiting and retaining the caliber of engineers needed for this initiative in the San Mateo market requires a manager who commands credibility. A base salary of $240,000 reflects the dual challenge of technical leadership and talent competition."

**Lever 2 — Thoma Bravo Execution Premium:** "Thoma Bravo expects PE-grade execution velocity. As an Engineering Manager, my team's delivery pace directly impacts the company's path from an $8B acquisition to a successful exit. I'd like an option grant of 20,000 shares to ensure I'm meaningfully aligned with the exit outcome, plus clarity on how refresh grants are structured for managers who exceed delivery targets."

**Lever 3 — Supply-Chain Resilience Delivery Ownership:** "The Supply-Chain Resilience features my team will ship — geopolitical risk engines, sovereign sourcing optimization, multi-vendor orchestration — are Coupa's primary market differentiator. Owning delivery of these capabilities for 3,000+ enterprise customers requires a compensation package that reflects the strategic weight. I'm looking at total comp in the $440,000 range, inclusive of base, options, and bonus."

**Lever 4 — Community Intelligence Org Building:** "Scaling the AI-powered community intelligence platform requires me to recruit specialized ML and data engineers in one of the world's most competitive talent markets. I'd like a $30,000 signing bonus and a commitment to a management-level retention bonus at the 18-month mark, ensuring continuity through the critical Autonomous Sourcing build phase."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $245,000 base with 20,000 options (4yr vest), a $30,000 signing bonus, and an 18-month retention bonus of $25,000. Anchor on the Autonomous Sourcing team leadership premium and the PE execution intensity. Counter their likely offer of $210,000 base with 12,000 options by pushing for 16,000 options minimum and a $25,000 signing bonus. Accept-at floor: $205,000 base + 14,000 options + $20,000 signing bonus = ~$320,000 total first-year comp. Below this floor, the role is undervalued relative to EM positions at comparable enterprise platforms in the San Mateo corridor.
