## Compensation Benchmarks by Region

| Component | Cambridge UK (GBP) | London (GBP) | San Francisco (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base Salary | £55,000 – £80,000 | £65,000 – £95,000 | $140,000 – $195,000 |
| Annual Bonus | £5,500 – £12,000 | £6,500 – £14,250 | $14,000 – $29,250 |
| RSU Grant (4-yr vest) | £15,000 – £35,000 | £20,000 – £50,000 | $40,000 – $100,000 |
| Signing Bonus | £3,000 – £8,000 | £5,000 – £10,000 | $10,000 – $25,000 |
| Total Year-1 Comp | £70,250 – £107,750 | £84,000 – £132,000 | $179,000 – $274,250 |

**Equity:** Darktrace RSUs (LSE: DARK) — 4-year vesting schedule. Product Designers receive RSU grants that are competitive within cybersecurity but may trail pure FAANG-level design roles. Negotiate RSUs by emphasizing the strategic importance of UX in security products.

## Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at Darktrace face a unique challenge: making complex AI-driven cybersecurity insights accessible and actionable for security operations teams. Darktrace's Threat Visualizer and response dashboards are core product differentiators, and the designer who shapes these experiences directly impacts customer adoption and retention. The company is publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: DARK) and competes for design talent against both cybersecurity companies and consumer tech firms. Your leverage comes from the intersection of security domain knowledge and design craft — most designers lack cybersecurity context, and most security engineers lack design sensibility. The launch of SECURE AI creates new design surfaces that will define how enterprises interact with AI-security-for-AI tools.

**Level Mapping:** Product Designer at Darktrace maps to L4–L5 UX at Google, IC4–IC5 Design at Meta, UX Designer II–III at Amazon, and 61–63 Designer at Microsoft.

### Darktrace SECURE AI & Agentic Identity Defender Lever

On **Feb 3, 2026**, Darktrace published the **State of AI** report, documenting the rise of autonomous AI agents and the identity-based attack vectors they introduce into enterprise environments. Alongside the report, Darktrace launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI** — a new product line for securing AI systems from adversarial manipulation.

As a Product Designer candidate, position yourself as the designer who will make **Agentic Identity** defense comprehensible. The State of AI report reveals a complex new threat category — AI agents impersonating other AI agents, autonomous systems being manipulated through identity attacks — and someone needs to design the interfaces that let human security teams understand and respond to these threats. Darktrace (LSE: DARK) needs designers who can translate agentic AI complexity into intuitive visual experiences.

**How to use this in negotiation:** Explain that SECURE AI's success depends on its usability — if security analysts cannot quickly understand an agentic identity threat, the product fails regardless of its detection accuracy. Position your design expertise as the bridge between Darktrace's AI capabilities and customer value realization.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**Lever 1 — Competing Offers & Design-Security Scarcity:**
> "I have a competing offer from a Series C cybersecurity startup at $175,000 base / £78,000 base. I'm more excited about Darktrace's self-learning AI platform, but designers with cybersecurity product experience are rare, and I need the offer to reflect that scarcity."

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside & Product Impact:**
> "I'd like to increase the RSU grant to £40,000 / $85,000 over four years. The design of the SECURE AI interface will directly drive adoption and NPS, which translates to ARR growth for LSE: DARK shareholders."

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus:**
> "I'm forfeiting unvested equity worth approximately £8,000 / $18,000 at my current employer. A signing bonus to cover this gap would remove the last barrier to accepting."

**Lever 4 — Tools & Growth Budget:**
> "I'd like a £3,000 / $5,000 annual budget for design tools, conferences, and professional development, plus a commitment to a 6-month compensation review tied to SECURE AI design milestones."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For Cambridge, target £74,000 base with £30,000 in RSUs (4-yr) and a £6,000 signing bonus. For London, push for £88,000 base with £42,000 in RSUs and £8,000 signing bonus. For San Francisco, anchor at $180,000 base with $85,000 in RSUs and $20,000 signing bonus. Use competing offers from cybersecurity or enterprise SaaS companies to push base 8–12% above initial offer. Accept-at floor: Cambridge £60,000 base / London £72,000 base / San Francisco $150,000 base — below these numbers, the offer undervalues design talent with security domain expertise.
