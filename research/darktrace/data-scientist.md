## Compensation Benchmarks by Region

| Component | Cambridge UK (GBP) | London (GBP) | San Francisco (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base Salary | £65,000 – £95,000 | £75,000 – £110,000 | $155,000 – $210,000 |
| Annual Bonus | £6,500 – £14,250 | £7,500 – £16,500 | $15,500 – $31,500 |
| RSU Grant (4-yr vest) | £25,000 – £55,000 | £30,000 – £70,000 | $60,000 – $140,000 |
| Signing Bonus | £4,000 – £10,000 | £6,000 – £12,000 | $12,000 – $30,000 |
| Total Year-1 Comp | £87,750 – £132,500 | £101,000 – £156,000 | $212,500 – $326,500 |

**Equity:** Darktrace RSUs (LSE: DARK) — 4-year vesting schedule. Data Scientists working on core detection models may receive higher RSU grants due to the direct revenue impact of model accuracy on customer retention and expansion.

## Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at Darktrace are not building dashboards — they are developing the unsupervised machine learning models that detect novel cyber threats in real time across thousands of enterprise deployments. Darktrace's entire competitive moat rests on the quality of its self-learning AI, and Data Scientists are the people who improve, validate, and extend these models. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: DARK) and has a globally recognized brand in AI cybersecurity. Your negotiation leverage comes from the fact that Darktrace needs Data Scientists who understand both statistical modeling and the adversarial dynamics of cybersecurity — a combination that is difficult to hire for. Cambridge UK is the primary hub for Darktrace's AI research team, making it the highest-impact location for this role.

**Level Mapping:** Data Scientist at Darktrace maps to L4–L5 DS at Google, IC4–IC5 DS at Meta, Data Scientist II–III at Amazon, and 61–63 DS at Microsoft.

### Darktrace SECURE AI & Agentic Identity Defender Lever

On **February 3, 2026**, Darktrace published the **State of AI** report, a comprehensive analysis of how autonomous AI agents are transforming the cyber threat landscape. The report found that AI agents operating across enterprise environments create novel identity-based vulnerabilities that traditional security models cannot address. In response, Darktrace launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI** — a product line that applies self-learning AI to detect threats targeting AI systems themselves.

As a Data Scientist candidate, position yourself as the researcher who will build the detection models for **Agentic Identity** threats. The State of AI report reveals that adversaries are already exploiting the identity confusion between legitimate and malicious AI agents — and Darktrace (LSE: DARK) needs Data Scientists who can develop unsupervised models that distinguish between authentic and spoofed agentic behaviors.

**How to use this in negotiation:** Tell the hiring team that your research background in [anomaly detection / adversarial ML / behavioral modeling] directly maps to the SECURE AI detection challenge. Frame yourself as someone who will define the mathematical foundations of the Agentic Identity defense category.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**Lever 1 — Competing Offers & Research Scarcity:**
> "I'm evaluating an offer from DeepMind / a well-funded AI startup at $195,000 base / £90,000 base. I find Darktrace's applied AI approach compelling, particularly the SECURE AI challenge, but I need the compensation to reflect the market for Data Scientists with adversarial ML experience."

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside & Model Impact:**
> "The detection models I build will directly impact customer retention and ARR growth. I'd like the RSU grant increased to £60,000 / $120,000 over four years — my models will protect LSE: DARK shareholder value."

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus:**
> "I'm forfeiting approximately £10,000 / $25,000 in unvested equity at my current employer. A signing bonus to bridge this gap would allow me to accept immediately."

**Lever 4 — Research Freedom & Publication:**
> "I'd like a commitment that I can publish non-proprietary research findings and attend at least 2 top-tier conferences per year (NeurIPS, ICML, IEEE S&P). This is essential for my career growth and also benefits Darktrace's employer brand."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For Cambridge, target £88,000 base with £48,000 in RSUs (4-yr) and an £8,000 signing bonus. For London, push for £102,000 base with £60,000 in RSUs and £10,000 signing bonus. For San Francisco, anchor at $195,000 base with $120,000 in RSUs and $25,000 signing bonus. Use competing offers from AI research labs or cybersecurity companies to push base 10–14% above initial offer. Accept-at floor: Cambridge £72,000 base / London £82,000 base / San Francisco $165,000 base — below these levels, negotiate for conference budget, publication rights, and 25% more RSUs.
