## Negotiation DNA

Darktrace is a world leader in self-learning AI cybersecurity, applying unsupervised machine learning to detect and respond to novel cyber threats in real time. As a Software Engineer at Darktrace, you are building the core detection and response engines that protect thousands of enterprises globally. The company's listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: DARK) and its expansion into AI-security-for-AI positions it at the intersection of two massive growth vectors. Your negotiation leverage comes from the scarcity of engineers who can build production-grade AI security systems and the company's aggressive hiring to support its new SECURE AI product line. Emphasize your ability to contribute to Darktrace's self-learning architecture and your understanding of the autonomous threat landscape.

**Level Mapping:** Software Engineer at Darktrace maps to L3–L4 at Google, E3–E4 at Meta, SDE I–II at Amazon, and 59–61 at Microsoft.

### Darktrace SECURE AI & Agentic Identity Defender Lever

On **Feb 3, 2026**, Darktrace published its landmark **State of AI** report and simultaneously launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI** — an entirely new product line purpose-built for securing AI systems themselves. This is not incremental; it represents a new revenue stream and a fundamental expansion of Darktrace's total addressable market.

As a Software Engineer candidate, position yourself as an **Agentic Identity** defender — someone who understands how autonomous AI agents create new identity-based attack surfaces and can build the detection systems to protect them. Darktrace (LSE: DARK) is investing heavily in engineers who can bridge traditional cybersecurity with the emerging challenge of securing agentic AI workloads.

**How to use this in negotiation:** Tell the hiring manager that you recognize the State of AI report's findings about the explosion of autonomous AI identities in enterprise environments, and that you're prepared to build the core platform components of SECURE AI from day one. This frames you not as a generic hire, but as a strategic investment in Darktrace's highest-priority growth initiative.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**Lever 1 — Competing Offers & Market Scarcity:**
> "I'm currently evaluating offers from [CrowdStrike / Palo Alto Networks / SentinelOne], and their total compensation packages are competitive. I'm genuinely excited about Darktrace's self-learning AI approach — can we align the base to be within range of what I'm seeing elsewhere?"

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside & LSE: DARK Growth:**
> "I believe strongly in Darktrace's trajectory on the London Stock Exchange, especially with the SECURE AI launch. I'd be comfortable accepting a slightly lower base if the RSU grant were increased to reflect the long-term upside I see in LSE: DARK shares."

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus for Transition Costs:**
> "I'll be forfeiting unvested equity at my current employer. A signing bonus of £7,000 / $20,000 would bridge that gap and make the move straightforward."

**Lever 4 — Scope & Impact Acceleration:**
> "Given the urgency of the SECURE AI product roadmap, I'd like to discuss accelerated review timelines — a 6-month compensation review rather than the standard 12-month cycle, tied to measurable contributions to the platform."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For Cambridge, target £70,000 base with £25,000 in RSUs and a £5,000 signing bonus. For London, push for £80,000 base with £35,000 in RSUs and £8,000 signing bonus. For San Francisco, anchor at $155,000 base with $70,000 in RSUs and $20,000 signing bonus. If you hold a competing offer from CrowdStrike or Palo Alto Networks, use it to push base 8–12% above initial offer. Accept-at floor: Cambridge £62,000 base / London £68,000 base / San Francisco $140,000 base — below these numbers, the offer undervalues market rate for AI cybersecurity engineers in 2026.
