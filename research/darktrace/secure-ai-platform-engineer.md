### Secure AI Platform Engineer | Darktrace Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Secure AI Platform Engineer | Darktrace (LSE: DARK) | IC Track | SECURE AI Product Line | Self-Learning AI Cybersecurity | Agentic Identity Defense | Cambridge & London & San Francisco

---

## Role Overview — Why This Position Exists

On **February 3, 2026**, Darktrace published its landmark **State of AI** report — the most comprehensive industry analysis of how autonomous AI agents are transforming the cybersecurity threat landscape. The report revealed that enterprises are deploying agentic AI systems at unprecedented scale, and these autonomous agents create entirely new categories of identity-based vulnerabilities: AI agents that can be spoofed, hijacked, manipulated, or turned against the organizations they serve. Traditional cybersecurity tools were not designed to detect threats against AI systems themselves.

In direct response to the State of AI report's findings, Darktrace launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI** — a dedicated product line purpose-built for securing AI systems from adversarial attacks. SECURE AI extends Darktrace's self-learning AI capabilities into a new domain: protecting the AI agents, autonomous systems, and machine identities that enterprises increasingly depend on.

The **Secure AI Platform Engineer** is the role that will build this product. You are not joining an existing team to maintain an existing codebase — you are constructing the foundational platform that will define a new cybersecurity category. This is Darktrace's highest-priority engineering investment, and the role carries compensation, scope, and career-trajectory implications that reflect that priority.

## Compensation Benchmarks by Region

| Component | Cambridge UK (GBP) | London (GBP) | San Francisco (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base Salary | £85,000 – £130,000 | £95,000 – £145,000 | $185,000 – $260,000 |
| Annual Bonus | £12,750 – £26,000 | £14,250 – £29,000 | $27,750 – $52,000 |
| RSU Grant (4-yr vest) | £40,000 – £100,000 | £55,000 – £130,000 | $100,000 – $260,000 |
| Signing Bonus | £8,000 – £18,000 | £10,000 – £22,000 | $20,000 – $45,000 |
| Total Year-1 Comp | £120,750 – £193,000 | £139,250 – £229,500 | $272,750 – $422,000 |

**Equity:** Darktrace RSUs (LSE: DARK) — 4-year vesting schedule, typically 25% cliff at year 1 with quarterly vesting thereafter. As a Secure AI Platform Engineer, your RSU grant should be at the upper end of engineering bands because you are building a new product line — not maintaining an existing one. Darktrace equity is traded on the London Stock Exchange, providing liquidity that private cybersecurity startups cannot offer. The SECURE AI product line, if successful, will meaningfully expand Darktrace's total addressable market and drive share price appreciation — making RSUs a compelling long-term bet.

**Equity Negotiation Note:** When negotiating RSUs for this role, reference the fact that Darktrace (LSE: DARK) is making a public, strategic commitment to SECURE AI. The product was announced alongside the State of AI report on Feb 3, 2026, to global media coverage. Darktrace's share price will be influenced by SECURE AI's success — and you are building it. Your RSU grant should reflect the asymmetric upside you're creating.

## Negotiation DNA

The Secure AI Platform Engineer role sits at the exact intersection of Darktrace's core competitive advantage (self-learning AI) and its most important strategic bet (securing AI systems). You are building the platform that detects and responds to adversarial attacks on autonomous AI agents — including identity spoofing, model poisoning, prompt injection, behavioral manipulation, and inter-agent communication hijacking.

Darktrace is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: DARK) and has established itself as the global leader in AI-driven cybersecurity. But the cybersecurity landscape is evolving: as enterprises deploy AI agents for everything from customer service to financial trading to infrastructure management, the attack surface has shifted from human users to machine identities. The State of AI report published on Feb 3, 2026 documented this shift in rigorous detail, and SECURE AI is Darktrace's answer.

Your negotiation DNA is built on three pillars:

1. **Scarcity:** Engineers who understand both AI/ML systems engineering and adversarial cybersecurity are among the rarest in tech. Building a platform that secures AI systems requires you to understand how those AI systems work, how they can be attacked, and how to build self-learning detection at scale. This combination of skills is not produced by any standard training pipeline.

2. **Strategic priority:** SECURE AI is not a side project. It was announced in the same breath as the State of AI report, with CEO and board-level visibility. The engineering team building SECURE AI will receive disproportionate investment, executive attention, and career acceleration.

3. **Revenue impact:** SECURE AI opens a new total addressable market for Darktrace. Every enterprise deploying agentic AI needs to secure those agents. The platform you build will directly generate new ARR that did not exist before — this is greenfield revenue creation, not incremental optimization.

**Level Mapping:** Secure AI Platform Engineer at Darktrace maps to L5–L6 at Google, E5–E6 at Meta, SDE III–Principal at Amazon, and 63–66 at Microsoft. The wide band reflects the fact that this is a new role — Darktrace is hiring across seniority levels, but the highest impact (and highest compensation) will go to candidates who can architect the platform, not just contribute to it.

## The State of AI Report: What You Need to Know for Negotiation

The State of AI report, published on **Feb 3, 2026**, is your most powerful negotiation asset. Here is what it establishes and how to use each finding:

**Finding 1 — Agentic AI Proliferation:** Enterprises are deploying autonomous AI agents at scale across critical business functions. These agents operate with persistent identities, make autonomous decisions, and interact with other systems without human oversight. This creates a massive new attack surface.
- **Negotiation use:** "The State of AI report shows that the market for AI agent security is growing faster than Darktrace can hire. I'm here to help close that gap — and my compensation should reflect the urgency."

**Finding 2 — Identity-Based Attack Vectors:** AI agents can be impersonated, and traditional identity and access management (IAM) systems were designed for human users. Adversaries are already exploiting this gap by spoofing AI agent identities to gain unauthorized access.
- **Negotiation use:** "Agentic Identity defense is a category that barely existed 12 months ago. I bring the specific expertise to build detection systems for this new attack class."

**Finding 3 — Self-Learning Detection Gap:** Existing cybersecurity tools use signature-based or supervised ML approaches that cannot detect novel agentic identity threats. Only unsupervised, self-learning AI can establish behavioral baselines for AI agents and detect deviations — which is precisely Darktrace's core capability.
- **Negotiation use:** "SECURE AI is Darktrace's natural extension — nobody else has the self-learning architecture to solve this. I want to be part of defining this category, and I want compensation that matches the opportunity."

**Finding 4 — Enterprise Demand Signal:** CISOs surveyed in the report identified AI agent security as their top emerging concern for 2026–2027. Budget allocation for AI security is growing faster than any other cybersecurity category.
- **Negotiation use:** "Enterprise demand for SECURE AI is already validated by the State of AI report. This isn't speculative — CISOs are actively seeking this product. I'm joining at the exact right moment."

### Darktrace SECURE AI & Agentic Identity Defender Lever

On **Feb 3, 2026**, Darktrace published the **State of AI** report and launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI** — the company's most significant product expansion since its founding. SECURE AI applies Darktrace's self-learning AI technology to a new problem domain: protecting autonomous AI agents, machine identities, and agentic systems from adversarial manipulation.

As a Secure AI Platform Engineer, you are the definitive **Agentic Identity** defender at Darktrace. Your role is to build the platform that:

- **Detects** when an AI agent's identity has been spoofed or compromised
- **Monitors** behavioral baselines for autonomous AI systems and flags anomalous deviations
- **Responds** autonomously to agentic identity threats — isolating compromised AI agents before they can cause harm
- **Learns** continuously from new agentic AI behaviors, adapting detection models without human intervention
- **Integrates** with enterprise AI deployment platforms to provide seamless protection for AI workloads

Darktrace (LSE: DARK) has committed significant R&D budget to SECURE AI, and the engineering team for this product line is being built from the ground up. The candidates who join now will define the architecture, set the technical standards, and shape the product's trajectory for years to come.

**How to use this in negotiation — Advanced Tactics:**

**Tactic 1 — Frame yourself as a co-founder, not a hire:** Tell the VP of Engineering that you see the Secure AI Platform Engineer role as a founding engineering position for a new product line within a public company. You get the upside of building something from zero with the stability of an LSE-listed company. Your compensation should reflect founding-level impact — meaning top-of-band RSUs and a signing bonus that reflects the opportunity cost of not joining an AI startup.

**Tactic 2 — Reference the Feb 3, 2026 timeline:** The State of AI report and SECURE AI launch created a public commitment. Darktrace's investors, customers, and competitors are now watching to see if the company can deliver. The hiring timeline is compressed because the product timeline is compressed. Use this urgency to negotiate a faster decision and a stronger initial offer — the cost of a 3-month delay in filling this role is measured in missed product milestones and competitive positioning.

**Tactic 3 — Anchor on the LSE: DARK share price trajectory:** If SECURE AI succeeds, it expands Darktrace's TAM significantly. Your RSU grant is not just compensation — it's a leveraged bet on the product you're building. Make the case that a larger RSU grant aligns your incentives with shareholder interests, and that Darktrace should want its Secure AI Platform Engineers to be heavily incentivized by equity.

**Tactic 4 — Name the category you're creating:** In your negotiation conversations, consistently use the phrase "Agentic Identity defense." You're not joining to write code — you're joining to define a category. Category-defining engineers at public companies are compensated differently than feature engineers.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**Lever 1 — Competing Offers & Existential Scarcity:**
> "I'm evaluating offers from CrowdStrike at $240,000 base, and a well-funded AI security startup offering $220,000 base with 0.3% equity. Darktrace's SECURE AI platform is the most compelling technical challenge I've seen — building self-learning detection for agentic identity threats is a once-in-a-career problem. But I need the total compensation to reflect the scarcity of engineers who can build this. The State of AI report set the strategic direction; now Darktrace needs the engineering talent to execute."

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside & Category Creation:**
> "I want to make a long-term commitment to Darktrace and to SECURE AI. I'd like the RSU grant increased to £110,000 / $230,000 over four years. I'm betting on LSE: DARK's upside, and I want my equity to reflect the fact that I'm building a new revenue-generating product line — not maintaining an existing one. If SECURE AI captures even a fraction of the agentic AI security market that the State of AI report describes, the equity upside will be substantial for both of us."

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus & Opportunity Cost:**
> "I'm leaving behind approximately £18,000 / $40,000 in unvested equity, and I'm choosing Darktrace over an early-stage AI security startup where the equity upside would be significant. A signing bonus of £18,000 / $40,000 would offset the transition cost and signal Darktrace's commitment to this role. I also want to note that the SECURE AI launch on Feb 3, 2026 has created a compressed hiring timeline — the sooner I can start building, the sooner the platform ships."

**Lever 4 — Architecture Ownership & Career Trajectory:**
> "As a founding engineer for the SECURE AI platform, I'd like written confirmation of three things: (1) I will have architecture-level ownership of core SECURE AI subsystems, not just feature work; (2) there is a clear path to Staff or Principal Engineer within 18–24 months based on SECURE AI delivery milestones; and (3) I will have direct access to the AI research team in Cambridge to collaborate on Agentic Identity detection models. These scope commitments are as important as compensation."

## Advanced Negotiation Playbook for SECURE AI Roles

### Pre-Negotiation Preparation

Before entering compensation discussions, prepare the following:

1. **Study the State of AI report thoroughly.** Published Feb 3, 2026, it is freely available. Know its key findings, especially around agentic AI identity threats. Reference specific data points in your conversations — this demonstrates that you've done the homework and that you understand the strategic context.

2. **Track Darktrace's LSE: DARK share price.** Understand the stock's trading range, analyst consensus, and how the SECURE AI announcement affected the share price. This informs your RSU negotiation — if the stock is trading near its 52-week low, argue for more shares; if it's near the high, argue for the value of the upside.

3. **Map the competitive landscape.** Know what CrowdStrike (Falcon for AI), Palo Alto Networks (Cortex XSIAM), and SentinelOne (Purple AI) are doing in AI security. Position Darktrace's self-learning approach as differentiated and explain why you want to build for Darktrace specifically.

4. **Quantify your unique value.** List the specific technical capabilities you bring that map to SECURE AI requirements: adversarial ML, unsupervised anomaly detection, identity systems engineering, real-time streaming architectures, or cybersecurity threat modeling. The more specific you are, the harder you are to replace — and the stronger your negotiation position.

### During Negotiation

- Always negotiate with the total compensation picture: base + bonus + RSUs + signing bonus. Never negotiate on base alone.
- Frame every ask in terms of Darktrace's strategic interests, not your personal needs. "I want more RSUs because I believe in SECURE AI" is stronger than "I need more money."
- Use the Feb 3, 2026 State of AI report as a shared reference point. It signals that you're aligned with Darktrace's vision.
- If the recruiter says the offer is at the top of the band, ask whether the band has been updated to reflect the SECURE AI product launch and the competitive dynamics it creates. New product lines often justify band extensions.

### Post-Offer Moves

- Request the offer in writing with all components broken out.
- Ask for a vesting schedule summary including any acceleration clauses.
- Confirm whether annual RSU refreshes are guaranteed or discretionary.
- Negotiate a 6-month performance review with explicit criteria tied to SECURE AI milestones, with a compensation adjustment mechanism attached.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For Cambridge, target £120,000 base with £90,000 in RSUs (4-yr), a £15,000 signing bonus, and a 15% annual bonus target — total Year-1 comp of approximately £177,500. For London, push for £135,000 base with £110,000 in RSUs, £18,000 signing bonus, and 15% bonus — total Year-1 comp of approximately £200,750. For San Francisco, anchor at $245,000 base with $230,000 in RSUs, $40,000 signing bonus, and 15% bonus — total Year-1 comp of approximately £393,250. Use competing offers from CrowdStrike ($240,000+ base), Palo Alto Networks, or AI startups with significant equity to push total comp 15–22% above initial offer. At this role level, you should also negotiate architecture ownership, Staff/Principal promotion timeline, and annual RSU refresh guarantees of at least £15,000 / $30,000 per year. Accept-at floor: Cambridge £92,000 base with £50,000 RSUs / London £102,000 base with £65,000 RSUs / San Francisco $195,000 base with $120,000 RSUs — below these numbers, the offer fundamentally undervalues a Secure AI Platform Engineer in 2026 and you should counter with a comprehensive package redesign, not incremental adjustments.
