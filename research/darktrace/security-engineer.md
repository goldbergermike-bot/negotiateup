## Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at Darktrace hold a uniquely critical position: they secure the security company. Your role spans product security (ensuring the platform itself is hardened), internal security (protecting Darktrace's own infrastructure), and the intersection of both — ensuring that Darktrace's self-learning AI cannot be adversarially manipulated. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: DARK) and any security incident at a cybersecurity vendor is existentially reputational. Your negotiation leverage is exceptional because the consequences of underinvesting in this role are catastrophic for Darktrace's brand and stock price. Security engineers who understand adversarial ML, secure SDLC, and platform hardening at scale are among the rarest hires in tech.

**Level Mapping:** Security Engineer at Darktrace maps to L4–L5 Security Engineer at Google, IC4–IC5 Security at Meta, Security Engineer II–III at Amazon, and 61–63 Security at Microsoft.

### Darktrace SECURE AI & Agentic Identity Defender Lever

On **Feb 3, 2026**, Darktrace published the **State of AI** report, analyzing how autonomous AI agents are introducing new identity-based vulnerabilities into enterprise environments. In tandem, Darktrace launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI**, a product line dedicated to detecting and neutralizing adversarial attacks on AI systems — including identity spoofing, model manipulation, and autonomous agent hijacking.

As a Security Engineer candidate, you are the most natural **Agentic Identity** defender in the entire organization. You understand threat modeling, attack surfaces, and adversarial thinking — and the State of AI report describes a new class of threats that requires exactly your expertise. Darktrace (LSE: DARK) needs Security Engineers who can both protect the SECURE AI platform from attack and contribute to the threat intelligence that makes the product effective.

**How to use this in negotiation:** Frame yourself as dual-purpose: you protect Darktrace's own systems AND you contribute domain expertise to the SECURE AI product. This dual impact justifies premium compensation because your threat modeling knowledge informs both internal security posture and product capability.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**Lever 1 — Competing Offers & Security Talent Crisis:**
> "I'm evaluating a Security Engineer offer from CrowdStrike at $210,000 base / £100,000 base. Security engineering talent is in extreme shortage, and I need Darktrace's offer to reflect the market reality. A security incident at a cybersecurity vendor would be devastating — this role protects the company's core asset."

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside & Risk Mitigation:**
> "I'd like the RSU grant increased to £60,000 / $130,000 over four years. My work directly protects LSE: DARK shareholder value by ensuring the platform cannot be compromised. A breach would cost Darktrace orders of magnitude more than my equity."

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus & Clearance Premium:**
> "I hold [SC / DV clearance / relevant security certifications] that took years to obtain. A signing bonus of £12,000 / $30,000 reflects the value of these credentials and the unvested equity I'm leaving behind."

**Lever 4 — Training & Conference Budget:**
> "I'd like a £4,000 / $8,000 annual budget for security conferences (Black Hat, DEF CON, SANS) and certification renewals (OSCP, CISSP). Staying current on the threat landscape is a direct investment in Darktrace's security posture."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For Cambridge, target £96,000 base with £52,000 in RSUs (4-yr) and a £10,000 signing bonus. For London, push for £112,000 base with £65,000 in RSUs and £13,000 signing bonus. For San Francisco, anchor at $210,000 base with $130,000 in RSUs and $30,000 signing bonus. Use competing offers from CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, or Google to push total comp 12–16% above initial offer. Accept-at floor: Cambridge £76,000 base / London £88,000 base / San Francisco $175,000 base — below these levels, the offer is below market for security engineers at a publicly listed cybersecurity company and you should counter aggressively.
