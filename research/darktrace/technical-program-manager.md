## Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at Darktrace orchestrate the delivery of complex, cross-functional programs that span AI research, platform engineering, security operations, and go-to-market teams. Darktrace is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: DARK) and operates at a pace where execution speed is a competitive advantage — the company that ships AI cybersecurity capabilities first wins enterprise contracts. Your negotiation leverage as a TPM comes from your ability to accelerate delivery timelines and reduce coordination overhead across globally distributed teams. The launch of SECURE AI has created new program management complexity, and Darktrace needs TPMs who can manage the interdependencies between the new product line, the existing platform, and the enterprise sales cycle.

**Level Mapping:** Technical Program Manager at Darktrace maps to L5–L6 TPM at Google, IC5–IC6 TPM at Meta, Sr. TPM at Amazon, and 63–65 TPM at Microsoft.

### Darktrace SECURE AI & Agentic Identity Defender Lever

On **Feb 3, 2026**, Darktrace released the **State of AI** report, outlining how autonomous AI agents are creating new categories of identity-based threats in enterprise environments. Concurrent with the report, Darktrace launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI**, a dedicated product line for securing AI systems from adversarial manipulation.

As a Technical Program Manager candidate, position yourself as the execution leader who will ship **Agentic Identity** defense capabilities on time and at quality. Darktrace (LSE: DARK) has made a major public commitment with SECURE AI — the State of AI report has set market expectations, and now the company must deliver. A TPM who can coordinate AI research, engineering, and go-to-market teams to hit SECURE AI milestones is directly protecting Darktrace's credibility and stock price.

**How to use this in negotiation:** Explain that the SECURE AI launch represents the most complex cross-functional program Darktrace has undertaken — spanning AI research, security engineering, infrastructure, design, and enterprise sales. Your program management expertise directly de-risks this initiative.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**Lever 1 — Competing Offers & Execution Scarcity:**
> "I have a competing TPM offer from AWS / Google Cloud at $210,000 base / £98,000 base. I'm drawn to Darktrace because SECURE AI is a greenfield program with enormous scope, but I need the compensation to reflect the TPM market for AI cybersecurity programs."

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside & Program Impact:**
> "I'd like the RSU grant increased to £55,000 / $115,000 over four years. The programs I'll manage — particularly SECURE AI delivery — directly impact Darktrace's ability to hit ARR targets and maintain LSE: DARK share price."

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus:**
> "I'm forfeiting approximately £10,000 / $22,000 in unvested RSUs at my current employer. A signing bonus of £10,000 / $25,000 would offset this loss and demonstrate mutual commitment."

**Lever 4 — Scope Definition & Authority:**
> "I'd like written clarity on which programs I'll own — specifically, whether SECURE AI delivery is in my scope — and confirmation that I'll have direct access to the VP of Engineering and the product leadership team for decision escalation."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For Cambridge, target £92,000 base with £42,000 in RSUs (4-yr) and an £8,000 signing bonus. For London, push for £108,000 base with £55,000 in RSUs and £10,000 signing bonus. For San Francisco, anchor at $210,000 base with $115,000 in RSUs and $25,000 signing bonus. Use competing TPM offers from Google, AWS, or Microsoft to push total comp 10–14% above initial offer. Accept-at floor: Cambridge £76,000 base / London £86,000 base / San Francisco $175,000 base — below these numbers, counter with a 20% RSU uplift and written scope commitment including SECURE AI program ownership.
