## Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at Darktrace lead teams of 6–12 engineers building the core AI cybersecurity platform — spanning real-time detection, autonomous response, and the new SECURE AI product line. Darktrace (LSE: DARK) is publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange and operates a hybrid R&D model with deep technical work concentrated in Cambridge and London, with growing US operations in San Francisco. Your negotiation position as an EM is unique: you are both a people leader and a technical decision-maker, responsible for shipping product and retaining engineering talent in a competitive cybersecurity market. The EM role at Darktrace is especially critical right now because the company is scaling multiple teams simultaneously to support SECURE AI, meaning your ability to recruit and ship is immediately high-impact.

**Level Mapping:** Engineering Manager at Darktrace maps to L6 Manager at Google, M1 at Meta, SDM at Amazon, and 65 Manager at Microsoft.

### Darktrace SECURE AI & Agentic Identity Defender Lever

On **Feb 3, 2026**, Darktrace released the **State of AI** report, which documented the rapid proliferation of autonomous AI agents in enterprise environments and the novel identity-based attack vectors they create. Concurrent with the report, Darktrace launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI** — a new product line dedicated to securing AI systems from adversarial manipulation, including identity spoofing of AI agents.

As an Engineering Manager candidate, position yourself as the leader who will build and scale the **Agentic Identity** defense team. Darktrace (LSE: DARK) needs managers who can recruit specialized AI security engineers, establish technical standards for the SECURE AI platform, and deliver product milestones on an aggressive timeline. Your value is not just technical — it's organizational. You are the person who will turn the State of AI report's insights into a shipping product.

**How to use this in negotiation:** Tell the VP of Engineering that you understand the organizational challenge of standing up a new product line like SECURE AI, and that you've done it before — scaling a team from inception to production delivery. Frame your compensation ask as an investment in execution speed.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**Lever 1 — Competing Offers & Leadership Scarcity:**
> "I have a competing EM offer from CrowdStrike at $240,000 base / £115,000 base with a strong equity package. I'm drawn to Darktrace because of the technical depth and the SECURE AI opportunity, but I need the total compensation to reflect the EM market for AI cybersecurity."

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside & Team-Building Impact:**
> "I'd like to increase the RSU grant to £110,000 / $230,000 over four years. The team I'm building for SECURE AI will directly drive ARR growth, and I want my equity compensation aligned with that revenue impact on LSE: DARK."

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus for Transition:**
> "I'm forfeiting approximately £20,000 / $40,000 in unvested equity and a management bonus at my current employer. A signing bonus of £18,000 / $40,000 would make the transition straightforward."

**Lever 4 — Team Budget & Headcount Commitment:**
> "Beyond personal compensation, I'd like a written commitment to hire at least 4 engineers into my team within the first 6 months. My effectiveness as an EM — and my ability to deliver on SECURE AI milestones — depends on having the right team in place."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For Cambridge, target £115,000 base with £85,000 in RSUs (4-yr) and a £14,000 signing bonus. For London, push for £130,000 base with £110,000 in RSUs and £18,000 signing bonus. For San Francisco, anchor at $245,000 base with $230,000 in RSUs and $40,000 signing bonus. Use competing EM offers from CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, or Wiz to push total comp 12–18% above initial offer. Accept-at floor: Cambridge £95,000 base / London £108,000 base / San Francisco $210,000 base — below these numbers, insist on increased RSUs (minimum 25% uplift) and a guaranteed headcount commitment.
