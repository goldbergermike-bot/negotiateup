### DevOps Engineer | Darktrace Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** DevOps Engineer | Darktrace (LSE: DARK) | IC Track | Self-Learning AI Cybersecurity | Cambridge & London & San Francisco

---

## Compensation Benchmarks by Region

| Component | Cambridge UK (GBP) | London (GBP) | San Francisco (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base Salary | £60,000 – £85,000 | £70,000 – £100,000 | $150,000 – $200,000 |
| Annual Bonus | £6,000 – £12,750 | £7,000 – £15,000 | $15,000 – $30,000 |
| RSU Grant (4-yr vest) | £15,000 – £40,000 | £20,000 – £50,000 | $40,000 – $100,000 |
| Signing Bonus | £3,000 – £8,000 | £5,000 – £10,000 | $10,000 – $25,000 |
| Total Year-1 Comp | £72,750 – £113,750 | £87,000 – £137,500 | $190,000 – $280,000 |

**Equity:** Darktrace RSUs (LSE: DARK) — 4-year vesting schedule. DevOps Engineers at Darktrace receive RSU grants commensurate with the infrastructure criticality of their role — platform uptime directly impacts customer trust and ARR retention.

## Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at Darktrace own the infrastructure that keeps a global AI cybersecurity platform running at scale — deployment pipelines, cloud infrastructure, monitoring systems, and the operational reliability of real-time threat detection across thousands of enterprise customers. Darktrace is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: DARK) and operates a cloud-first architecture that must maintain extreme reliability standards because downtime in a security product creates customer risk. Your negotiation leverage comes from the operational criticality of the role: Darktrace cannot ship SECURE AI or maintain existing customer commitments without rock-solid infrastructure. DevOps engineers with cybersecurity platform experience are scarce, and those who understand the compliance requirements of security-grade infrastructure are even rarer.

**Level Mapping:** DevOps Engineer at Darktrace maps to L4–L5 SRE at Google, E4–E5 Production Engineer at Meta, SysDE II–III at Amazon, and 61–63 DevOps at Microsoft.

### Darktrace SECURE AI & Agentic Identity Defender Lever

On **Feb 3, 2026**, Darktrace released the **State of AI** report, detailing how autonomous AI agents are proliferating across enterprise environments and creating new identity-based attack surfaces. Concurrently, Darktrace launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI**, a new product line for securing AI systems from adversarial manipulation.

As a DevOps Engineer candidate, position yourself as the infrastructure specialist who will ensure SECURE AI scales reliably from launch to global deployment. The **Agentic Identity** defense platform requires infrastructure that can process, classify, and respond to AI agent identity signals at massive scale — and that infrastructure must itself be hardened against the very threats it detects. Darktrace (LSE: DARK) needs DevOps engineers who understand that the SECURE AI platform's infrastructure is a security surface in its own right.

**How to use this in negotiation:** Explain that launching a new product line like SECURE AI requires parallel infrastructure buildout — new deployment pipelines, new monitoring, new compliance controls — and that your experience standing up security-grade infrastructure will accelerate the product's time-to-market.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**Lever 1 — Competing Offers & Infrastructure Scarcity:**
> "I have a competing offer from a cloud security company at $185,000 base / £82,000 base. Darktrace's self-learning AI platform is more technically interesting, but I need the compensation to reflect the market for DevOps engineers with security platform experience."

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside & Platform Reliability:**
> "Platform uptime directly protects LSE: DARK shareholder value — every minute of downtime erodes customer trust. I'd like the RSU grant increased to £42,000 / $85,000 over four years to reflect the revenue-protection impact of my role."

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus:**
> "I'm leaving behind approximately £8,000 / $18,000 in unvested equity. A signing bonus of £8,000 / $20,000 would bridge the gap and let me commit immediately."

**Lever 4 — On-Call Compensation & Certifications:**
> "I'd like clarity on on-call compensation structure and a £2,500 / $5,000 annual budget for cloud certifications (AWS, GCP, Azure) that directly benefit Darktrace's infrastructure capabilities."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For Cambridge, target £78,000 base with £35,000 in RSUs (4-yr) and a £6,000 signing bonus. For London, push for £92,000 base with £45,000 in RSUs and £8,000 signing bonus. For San Francisco, anchor at $185,000 base with $85,000 in RSUs and $20,000 signing bonus. Use competing offers from cloud security companies or hyperscalers to push base 8–12% above initial offer. Accept-at floor: Cambridge £65,000 base / London £75,000 base / San Francisco $155,000 base — below these levels, insist on on-call premium, certification budget, and 20% RSU uplift.
