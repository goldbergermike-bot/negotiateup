## Negotiation DNA

Product Managers at Darktrace sit at the intersection of AI research, cybersecurity operations, and enterprise customer needs. You own the product roadmap for one or more platform modules — detection, response, visualization, or the newly launched SECURE AI line. Darktrace is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: DARK) and competes for PM talent against both cybersecurity incumbents and well-funded startups. Your negotiation leverage comes from domain expertise: a PM who understands both cybersecurity buyer psychology and AI/ML product development is exceptionally rare. Darktrace's Cambridge headquarters means that UK-based PMs have direct access to the R&D team, making these roles strategically important. The SECURE AI launch has created new PM headcount and urgency.

**Level Mapping:** Product Manager at Darktrace maps to L5 PM at Google, IC5 PM at Meta, Sr. PM at Amazon, and 63 PM at Microsoft.

### Darktrace SECURE AI & Agentic Identity Defender Lever

On **Feb 3, 2026**, Darktrace published the **State of AI** report, revealing how autonomous AI agents are creating unprecedented identity-based security challenges for enterprises. Alongside the report, Darktrace launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI**, a dedicated product line for protecting AI systems from adversarial threats — including identity manipulation of agentic AI workloads.

As a Product Manager candidate, position yourself as the PM who will define the **Agentic Identity** defense product category. Darktrace (LSE: DARK) needs PMs who can translate the State of AI report's technical findings into product requirements, customer-facing narratives, and go-to-market strategies. The SECURE AI product line is greenfield — the PM who owns it will shape a category.

**How to use this in negotiation:** Tell the hiring team that you see SECURE AI as a category-defining opportunity, and that your experience in [AI products / cybersecurity products / enterprise platform products] makes you the right PM to define the roadmap. Frame your compensation ask around the strategic value of the SECURE AI PM role, not just headcount.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**Lever 1 — Competing Offers & Domain Expertise:**
> "I'm evaluating a PM offer from CrowdStrike at $200,000 base / £95,000 base. I'm excited about Darktrace because SECURE AI is a greenfield product opportunity, but I need the compensation to reflect the domain expertise I bring in AI-native cybersecurity products."

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside & Product Ownership:**
> "As the PM who will own the SECURE AI roadmap, I'd like the RSU grant increased to £65,000 / $140,000 over four years. The product I build will directly drive new ARR for LSE: DARK, and I want my equity aligned with that outcome."

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus:**
> "I'll be leaving behind unvested equity worth approximately £12,000 / $25,000. A signing bonus to offset this would make my decision straightforward."

**Lever 4 — Scope & Title Guarantee:**
> "I want written confirmation that I'll own the SECURE AI product line as my primary scope, with direct access to the AI research team in Cambridge. This scope clarity is as important to me as compensation."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For Cambridge, target £92,000 base with £50,000 in RSUs (4-yr) and a £10,000 signing bonus. For London, push for £108,000 base with £70,000 in RSUs and £13,000 signing bonus. For San Francisco, anchor at $205,000 base with $140,000 in RSUs and $30,000 signing bonus. Use competing PM offers from CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, or Wiz to push total comp 10–15% above initial offer. Accept-at floor: Cambridge £78,000 base / London £88,000 base / San Francisco $170,000 base — below these numbers, counter with a request for 30% more RSUs and a guaranteed 6-month comp review.
