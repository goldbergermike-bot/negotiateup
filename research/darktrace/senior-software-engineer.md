## Compensation Benchmarks by Region

| Component | Cambridge UK (GBP) | London (GBP) | San Francisco (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base Salary | £75,000 – £100,000 | £85,000 – £115,000 | $170,000 – $220,000 |
| Annual Bonus | £7,500 – £15,000 | £8,500 – £17,250 | $17,000 – $33,000 |
| RSU Grant (4-yr vest) | £30,000 – £60,000 | £40,000 – £80,000 | $80,000 – $160,000 |
| Signing Bonus | £5,000 – £12,000 | £7,000 – £15,000 | $15,000 – $35,000 |
| Total Year-1 Comp | £95,000 – £142,000 | £107,250 – £157,250 | $222,000 – $328,000 |

**Equity:** Darktrace RSUs (LSE: DARK) — 4-year vesting schedule, typically 25% cliff at year 1 with quarterly vesting thereafter. As a Senior Engineer, your RSU grant is a significant component of total comp and should be negotiated aggressively.

## Negotiation DNA

Darktrace's self-learning AI cybersecurity platform protects over 8,000 organizations globally, and as a Senior Software Engineer you are expected to own critical subsystems — detection algorithms, response orchestration, or platform infrastructure. The company is publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: DARK) and has entered a new growth phase with the launch of SECURE AI. Senior engineers at Darktrace carry disproportionate influence because the codebase requires deep understanding of unsupervised machine learning applied to network telemetry at scale. Your leverage is highest when you can demonstrate experience shipping production ML systems and leading technical initiatives without managerial authority. Darktrace's Cambridge headquarters means that UK-based senior engineers are particularly valued for proximity to the core R&D team.

**Level Mapping:** Senior Software Engineer at Darktrace maps to L5 at Google, E5 at Meta, SDE III at Amazon, and 63 at Microsoft.

### Darktrace SECURE AI & Agentic Identity Defender Lever

On **February 3, 2026**, Darktrace released its **State of AI** report — the most comprehensive industry analysis of how autonomous AI agents are reshaping the cybersecurity threat landscape. Alongside the report, Darktrace launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI**, a dedicated product line for detecting and neutralizing threats that target AI systems themselves, including identity spoofing of autonomous agents.

As a Senior Software Engineer candidate, frame yourself as an **Agentic Identity** defender who can architect the detection layers that distinguish legitimate AI agent behavior from adversarial impersonation. Darktrace (LSE: DARK) needs senior engineers who understand both the ML pipeline and the security domain — this dual expertise is rare and commands premium compensation.

**How to use this in negotiation:** Reference the State of AI report's finding that enterprises are deploying AI agents faster than they can secure them. Position your experience as directly enabling SECURE AI's core value proposition. A senior engineer who can accelerate this product line by even one quarter is worth a significant premium over a generalist hire.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**Lever 1 — Competing Offers & Market Scarcity:**
> "I have a competing offer from CrowdStrike at $200,000 base / £95,000 base with a strong RSU package. Darktrace is my first choice because of the self-learning AI approach, but I need the total compensation to be competitive. Can we close the gap on base salary?"

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside & LSE: DARK Growth:**
> "The SECURE AI launch signals a major growth inflection for Darktrace. I'd like to increase the RSU component to £70,000 / $140,000 over four years — I'm betting on LSE: DARK's upside and I want my compensation to reflect that conviction."

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus for Equity Bridge:**
> "I'm leaving behind approximately £15,000 / $30,000 in unvested RSUs at my current employer. A signing bonus to offset this would remove the last friction from my decision."

**Lever 4 — Accelerated Vesting & Review:**
> "Given the urgency of the SECURE AI roadmap, I'd propose a front-loaded vesting schedule — 33% in year one instead of 25% — to align my compensation with the immediate impact I'll deliver on the platform."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For Cambridge, target £95,000 base with £50,000 in RSUs (4-yr) and a £10,000 signing bonus. For London, push for £108,000 base with £70,000 in RSUs and £12,000 signing bonus. For San Francisco, anchor at $205,000 base with $140,000 in RSUs and $30,000 signing bonus. Leverage competing offers from CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, or SentinelOne to push base 10–15% above initial offer. Accept-at floor: Cambridge £82,000 base / London £92,000 base / San Francisco $180,000 base — below these numbers, counter with a request to increase RSUs by 20% to compensate.
