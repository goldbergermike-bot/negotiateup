## Negotiation DNA

Solutions Architects at Darktrace are the technical face of the company in enterprise sales cycles. You conduct proof-of-value deployments, architect customer-specific integrations, and serve as the trusted technical advisor who convinces CISOs and security teams that Darktrace's self-learning AI is the right choice. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: DARK) and its ARR growth depends heavily on the quality of its technical pre-sales function. Your negotiation leverage comes from the direct revenue impact of your role — every large deal that closes has a Solutions Architect behind it. The launch of SECURE AI creates an entirely new selling motion that requires SAs who can articulate agentic AI security to enterprise buyers.

**Level Mapping:** Solutions Architect at Darktrace maps to Customer Engineer L5 at Google Cloud, Solutions Architect at AWS, and Technical Solutions Engineer at Palo Alto Networks.

### Darktrace SECURE AI & Agentic Identity Defender Lever

On **Feb 3, 2026**, Darktrace published the **State of AI** report, documenting the emergence of autonomous AI agents as a new attack surface in enterprise environments. Simultaneously, Darktrace launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI**, a product line purpose-built for securing AI systems from identity-based adversarial attacks.

As a Solutions Architect candidate, position yourself as the field expert who will sell the **Agentic Identity** defense narrative to enterprise CISOs. The State of AI report is a powerful sales tool — it positions Darktrace (LSE: DARK) as the thought leader in AI security. SAs who can walk a CISO through the agentic identity threat landscape and demonstrate how SECURE AI detects and responds to these threats will close larger deals faster.

**How to use this in negotiation:** Explain that the SECURE AI selling motion requires a new breed of Solutions Architect — one who can bridge AI/ML concepts, cybersecurity operations, and enterprise buying psychology. Your ability to translate the State of AI report's findings into customer-facing proof-of-value engagements makes you a revenue accelerator.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**Lever 1 — Competing Offers & Revenue Impact:**
> "I have a competing SA offer from Palo Alto Networks at $215,000 base / £100,000 base with strong variable comp. Darktrace's AI-first approach is differentiated, but I need the total OTE to reflect the revenue I'll generate for the SECURE AI product line."

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside & Deal Attribution:**
> "I'd like the RSU grant increased to £55,000 / $120,000 over four years. The deals I close directly drive ARR growth for LSE: DARK shareholders, and I want my equity aligned with that contribution."

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus & Ramp Period:**
> "I'd like a signing bonus of £10,000 / $25,000 and a guaranteed ramp period of 3 months where my variable compensation is at 100% of target, regardless of deal closure."

**Lever 4 — Territory & Account Assignment:**
> "I want clarity on my territory and account assignment before accepting. Top-tier enterprise accounts with SECURE AI potential are critical to my success and my variable compensation. I'd like written confirmation of my account list."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For Cambridge, target £100,000 base with £48,000 in RSUs (4-yr) and a £10,000 signing bonus. For London, push for £115,000 base with £60,000 in RSUs and £12,000 signing bonus. For San Francisco, anchor at $215,000 base with $120,000 in RSUs and $25,000 signing bonus. Use competing SA offers from Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, or Zscaler to push total OTE 12–15% above initial offer. Accept-at floor: Cambridge £82,000 base / London £92,000 base / San Francisco $180,000 base — below these numbers, negotiate for guaranteed ramp compensation, premium territory assignment, and 25% more RSUs.
