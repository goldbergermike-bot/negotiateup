## Compensation Benchmarks by Region

| Component | Cambridge UK (GBP) | London (GBP) | San Francisco (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base Salary | £60,000 – £90,000 | £70,000 – £105,000 | $150,000 – $205,000 |
| Annual Bonus | £6,000 – £13,500 | £7,000 – £15,750 | $15,000 – $30,750 |
| RSU Grant (4-yr vest) | £20,000 – £45,000 | £25,000 – £60,000 | $50,000 – $120,000 |
| Signing Bonus | £3,000 – £8,000 | £5,000 – £12,000 | $10,000 – $25,000 |
| Total Year-1 Comp | £79,000 – £121,250 | £94,250 – £147,750 | $200,000 – $305,750 |

**Equity:** Darktrace RSUs (LSE: DARK) — 4-year vesting schedule. Data Engineers at Darktrace directly enable the self-learning AI pipeline by ensuring high-quality, real-time data flows. Negotiate RSUs by emphasizing the data platform's critical role in detection accuracy.

## Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at Darktrace build and maintain the data infrastructure that feeds Darktrace's self-learning AI models — ingesting, transforming, and delivering network telemetry, endpoint data, and identity signals at massive scale and in real time. Darktrace is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: DARK) and processes billions of data points daily across thousands of enterprise deployments. The quality of Darktrace's AI detection is only as good as the data pipeline that feeds it, making this role foundational to the company's value proposition. Your negotiation leverage comes from the direct link between data quality and model performance — and from the fact that the SECURE AI product line introduces entirely new data types (agentic AI telemetry) that require new pipeline architectures.

**Level Mapping:** Data Engineer at Darktrace maps to L4–L5 Data Engineer at Google, IC4–IC5 Data Engineer at Meta, Data Engineer II–III at Amazon, and 61–63 DE at Microsoft.

### Darktrace SECURE AI & Agentic Identity Defender Lever

On **February 3, 2026**, Darktrace published the **State of AI** report, revealing that autonomous AI agents generate entirely new categories of identity and behavioral data that existing security data pipelines are not designed to process. In parallel, Darktrace launched **Darktrace / SECURE AI**, a product line that requires ingesting and analyzing AI agent telemetry to detect identity-based attacks on autonomous systems.

As a Data Engineer candidate, position yourself as the pipeline architect for **Agentic Identity** defense. The SECURE AI platform needs someone who can design data pipelines that ingest AI agent identity signals, behavioral traces, and inter-agent communication patterns — data types that did not exist at scale until recently. Darktrace (LSE: DARK) needs Data Engineers who can extend the existing data platform to support this new category of telemetry.

**How to use this in negotiation:** Explain that SECURE AI's detection accuracy depends entirely on the data pipeline's ability to capture, normalize, and deliver agentic AI telemetry in real time. Your data engineering expertise is the enabling layer for the entire product line — without the right data, the models cannot learn.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**Lever 1 — Competing Offers & Pipeline Expertise:**
> "I have a competing offer from a data infrastructure company at $190,000 base / £85,000 base. Darktrace's real-time data challenge is more technically compelling, but I need the compensation to reflect the market for Data Engineers with streaming pipeline and cybersecurity experience."

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside & Data-Model Link:**
> "I'd like the RSU grant increased to £48,000 / $105,000 over four years. The data pipelines I build directly determine the accuracy of Darktrace's AI models, which drives customer retention and ARR growth for LSE: DARK."

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus:**
> "I'm leaving behind approximately £8,000 / $18,000 in unvested equity. A signing bonus to offset this gap would let me commit immediately."

**Lever 4 — Technology Stack & Growth:**
> "I'd like clarity on the data engineering technology stack (Kafka, Spark, Flink, etc.) and a commitment to a £3,000 / $5,000 annual professional development budget for data engineering certifications and conferences."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For Cambridge, target £82,000 base with £40,000 in RSUs (4-yr) and a £6,000 signing bonus. For London, push for £96,000 base with £52,000 in RSUs and £10,000 signing bonus. For San Francisco, anchor at $190,000 base with $105,000 in RSUs and $20,000 signing bonus. Use competing offers from data infrastructure companies or cybersecurity firms to push base 10–13% above initial offer. Accept-at floor: Cambridge £66,000 base / London £76,000 base / San Francisco $158,000 base — below these levels, negotiate for 20% more RSUs, professional development budget, and a 6-month compensation review.
