#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at HashiCorp (IBM)

Technical Program Managers at HashiCorp (IBM) are the connective tissue that turns IBM's strategic vision for Security by Default into delivered products. The February 5, 2026 integration report highlighted the critical importance of "cross-organizational program execution" in delivering the HashiCorp-IBM integration — and TPMs are the ones who make it happen. Whether you're driving the Vault roadmap, coordinating Terraform releases, or managing the Red Hat integration timeline, your work directly impacts IBM Software's ability to hit milestones.

IBM's $15.7B FCF target depends on consistent, predictable product delivery. TPMs ensure that engineering teams ship on time, with quality, and in alignment with business objectives. In a post-acquisition environment with multiple stakeholder groups (HashiCorp, IBM, Red Hat), this coordination role is essential.

Red Hat synergy programs are particularly complex, requiring TPMs to coordinate across three distinct engineering organizations with different cultures, processes, and tools. This level of cross-organizational program management commands significant premiums.

| TPM1 | Band 8 | Technical Program Manager |
| TPM2 | Band 9 | Senior Technical Program Manager |

#### Global Lever 3: Red Hat OpenShift Integration

TPMs manage the cross-organizational integration programs between HashiCorp and Red Hat. Negotiation language: "I manage the integration program between HashiCorp and Red Hat — coordinating engineering efforts across three distinct organizations. This cross-organizational program management requires expertise that few TPMs possess."

#### Global Lever 4: IBM Enterprise Distribution

TPMs coordinate enterprise feature delivery and release management for IBM's distribution channels. Negotiation language: "I coordinate the enterprise release program that enables IBM's sales force to distribute HashiCorp products.
