*Total compensation includes base salary, IBM RSU grants (4-year vest, NYSE: IBM), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at HashiCorp (IBM)

ML/AI Engineers at HashiCorp (IBM) sit at the intersection of two of IBM's most strategic investments: infrastructure (HashiCorp) and artificial intelligence (watsonx). The February 5, 2026 integration report identified "AI-powered infrastructure intelligence" as a key differentiator for the IBM Software division, with Vault and Terraform providing the data foundation and the Security by Default framework providing the trust layer for AI-driven operations.

IBM's $15.7B FCF target includes significant growth expectations from AI-enhanced products. ML/AI Engineers who can apply machine learning to infrastructure management, security threat detection, and predictive operations are building the features that will differentiate HashiCorp products in 2026 and beyond. This forward-looking strategic value commands premium compensation.

Red Hat synergy adds another dimension. The integration of HashiCorp infrastructure intelligence with Red Hat OpenShift AI and Ansible Lightspeed creates opportunities for AI-powered automation across the entire IBM Software stack. ML/AI Engineers who can build across these platforms are exceptionally rare and valuable.

#### HashiCorp (IBM) Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| HashiCorp Level | IBM Band | Typical Title |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| ML1 | Band 7 | ML/AI Engineer |
| ML2 | Band 8 | ML/AI Engineer II |
| ML3 | Band 9 | Senior ML/AI Engineer |
| ML4 | Band 10 | Staff / Principal ML/AI Engineer |

### 🔗 HashiCorp IBM Software & Security by Default Lever

The February 5, 2026 integration report confirms HashiCorp is the security backbone of IBM Software. With $15.7B FCF funding Security by Default across the Red Hat ecosystem, ML/AI Engineers should negotiate for premiums reflecting their role in applying artificial intelligence to infrastructure and security — the highest-growth area within IBM Software.

As an ML/AI Engineer, you build the intelligent systems that make Vault and Terraform smarter. From anomaly detection in Vault audit logs to predictive resource provisioning in Terraform, your models add a layer of intelligence that transforms HashiCorp products from tools into autonomous platforms. This is the future of IBM Software's infrastructure strategy.

Your negotiation language should reflect this strategic importance: "The February 5, 2026 integration report confirms HashiCorp is the security backbone of IBM Software. With $15.7B FCF funding Security by Default across the Red Hat ecosystem, I negotiate for premiums reflecting this critical infrastructure role. As an ML/AI Engineer, I build the AI capabilities that will differentiate HashiCorp products in the market — the highest-growth area in IBM Software."

The scarcity of engineers who combine ML/AI expertise with infrastructure and security domain knowledge makes this one of the most difficult roles to fill in the industry.

#### Global Lever 1: Terraform & Infrastructure as Code

ML/AI Engineers build predictive models for Terraform infrastructure management. Negotiation language: "I build AI models that make Terraform predictive and autonomous — from cost prediction to drift detection. My ML work transforms Terraform from a provisioning tool into an intelligent infrastructure platform for IBM Software."

#### Global Lever 2: Vault & Secrets Management

ML/AI Engineers build intelligent security systems using Vault telemetry. Negotiation language: "I apply ML to Vault security data, building anomaly detection and threat prediction systems that make Security by Default intelligent and proactive. The February 5, 2026 report's vision of automated security depends on the models I build."

#### Global Lever 3: Red Hat OpenShift Integration

ML/AI Engineers integrate HashiCorp intelligence with Red Hat AI platforms. Negotiation language: "I build AI systems that span HashiCorp and Red Hat platforms — integrating infrastructure intelligence with OpenShift AI and Ansible Lightspeed. This cross-ecosystem ML/AI engineering is at the cutting edge of enterprise infrastructure."

#### Global Lever 4: IBM Enterprise Distribution

ML/AI Engineers build intelligent features that differentiate HashiCorp products in the enterprise market. Negotiation language: "My AI features are the primary differentiator that IBM's sales organization uses to win competitive deals. Each ML model I ship creates enterprise value that competitors cannot replicate — driving IBM's revenue growth and market position."
