#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at HashiCorp (IBM)

Data Engineers at HashiCorp (IBM) build the data infrastructure that underpins product analytics, customer telemetry, and business intelligence for the entire IBM Software HashiCorp portfolio. The February 5, 2026 integration report emphasized the importance of "data-driven decision making" in accelerating Security by Default adoption, and Data Engineers are the ones who make that possible by building the pipelines that capture and process Vault and Terraform telemetry.

IBM's $15.7B FCF target depends on data-driven insights about customer usage, product performance, and market trends. Data Engineers build the infrastructure that generates these insights — from real-time telemetry pipelines to data warehouses that support business intelligence. Without reliable data infrastructure, IBM cannot optimize its go-to-market strategy for HashiCorp products.

Red Hat synergy creates additional data engineering complexity. Integrating telemetry across HashiCorp products, IBM Cloud, and Red Hat OpenShift requires building data pipelines that span multiple systems and data formats. Data Engineers who can build this unified analytics layer are in high demand.

| DE1 | Band 7 | Data Engineer |
| DE2 | Band 8 | Data Engineer II |
| DE3 | Band 9 | Senior Data Engineer |

### 🔗 HashiCorp IBM Software & Security by Default Lever

The February 5, 2026 integration report confirms HashiCorp is the security backbone of IBM Software. With $15.7B FCF funding Security by Default across the Red Hat ecosystem, Data Engineers should negotiate for premiums reflecting their role in building the data infrastructure that powers product and business decisions.

As a Data Engineer, you build the pipelines that capture every significant event in the Vault and Terraform ecosystems. This telemetry powers product decisions, customer success, sales intelligence, and executive dashboards. Without your infrastructure, IBM Software cannot measure or improve Security by Default adoption.

Your negotiation language should reflect this foundational role: "The February 5, 2026 integration report confirms HashiCorp is the security backbone of IBM Software. With $15.7B FCF funding Security by Default across the Red Hat ecosystem, I negotiate for premiums reflecting this critical infrastructure role. As a Data Engineer, I build the data infrastructure that powers every data-driven decision at HashiCorp and IBM Software."

The combination of data engineering expertise, infrastructure domain knowledge, and security awareness makes this role uniquely difficult to fill.

#### Global Lever 1: Terraform & Infrastructure as Code

Data Engineers build telemetry pipelines that capture Terraform usage patterns across millions of deployments. Negotiation language: "I build the data pipelines that capture Terraform usage telemetry at scale. My infrastructure enables product teams to understand how millions of developers use Terraform and what features IBM Software should prioritize."

#### Global Lever 2: Vault & Secrets Management

Data Engineers build analytics infrastructure for Vault security telemetry and audit logs. Negotiation language: "I build the data infrastructure that processes Vault security telemetry and audit logs. The February 5, 2026 report's Security by Default metrics depend on the pipelines I build and maintain."

#### Global Lever 3: Red Hat OpenShift Integration

Data Engineers build unified analytics across HashiCorp and Red Hat product telemetry. Negotiation language: "I build unified data pipelines spanning HashiCorp, IBM Cloud, and Red Hat telemetry — creating a single source of truth for cross-product analytics. This cross-ecosystem data engineering is extremely complex and rare."

#### Global Lever 4: IBM Enterprise Distribution

Data Engineers build customer analytics and business intelligence infrastructure for IBM's enterprise sales organization. Negotiation language: "I build the data infrastructure that powers IBM's enterprise sales intelligence for HashiCorp products. My pipelines enable sales teams to identify expansion opportunities and accelerate deal cycles."
