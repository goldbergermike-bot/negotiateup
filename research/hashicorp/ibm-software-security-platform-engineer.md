#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at HashiCorp (IBM)

The IBM Software Security Platform Engineer is the role that the February 5, 2026 integration report was written for. This role didn't exist before the IBM acquisition — it was created to address the unique challenge of building a unified security and infrastructure platform that spans HashiCorp products (Vault, Terraform, Consul, Boundary), IBM Cloud, and Red Hat (OpenShift, Ansible, RHEL). It is the most strategically important engineering role in the IBM Software division, and it commands compensation to match.

IBM's $15.7B FCF target for FY2026 places the Security by Default initiative at the center of IBM's growth strategy. The IBM Software Security Platform Engineer is the person who makes Security by Default real — not as a marketing slogan, but as a technical reality. You design the security primitives, define the integration patterns, and build the platform capabilities that every IBM Software product depends on. When IBM's CEO talks about "Security by Default" on earnings calls, they are talking about the platform you build.

Red Hat synergy is not a secondary consideration for this role — it is a primary responsibility. You are the engineer who defines how Vault's secrets management integrates with Red Hat OpenShift's security model, how Terraform's provisioning layer interacts with Ansible Automation Platform, and how Consul's service mesh connects with Red Hat Service Interconnect. You are the architect of the most comprehensive enterprise infrastructure and security platform in the world.

The scarcity of engineers who can operate at this level — combining deep cryptographic expertise, distributed systems knowledge, multi-cloud architecture skills, and cross-organizational influence — is extreme. There are perhaps 50-100 engineers globally who could fill this role effectively. This supply-demand imbalance gives you extraordinary negotiation leverage.

#### HashiCorp (IBM) Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| HashiCorp Level | IBM Band | Typical Title |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| L4 | Band 8 | Security Platform Engineer II |
| L5 | Band 9 | Senior Security Platform Engineer |
| L6 | Band 10 | Staff Security Platform Engineer |
| L7 | Band 10+ | Principal Security Platform Engineer |
| L8 | Band 11 | Distinguished Security Platform Engineer |

#### Why This Role Is Unique

The IBM Software Security Platform Engineer combines responsibilities that are typically spread across three or four separate roles at other companies:

1. **Security Architecture**: You design the security model for the entire IBM Software infrastructure stack, including cryptographic implementations, zero-trust networking, and identity management through Vault.

2. **Platform Engineering**: You build the platform layer that connects Vault, Terraform, Consul, and Boundary into a cohesive Security by Default system that IBM Software products consume as a service.

3. **Integration Architecture**: You define the integration patterns between HashiCorp products, IBM Cloud services, and Red Hat platforms — ensuring security and infrastructure coherence across the entire ecosystem.

4. **Standards & Compliance**: You define the security standards and compliance frameworks that all IBM Software products must adhere to, and you build the tooling that enforces them through Vault and Terraform policies.

This breadth of responsibility, combined with the depth of technical expertise required, makes this the most demanding — and most valuable — engineering role at HashiCorp (IBM).

### 🔗 HashiCorp IBM Software & Security by Default Lever

The February 5, 2026 integration report confirms HashiCorp is the security backbone of IBM Software. With $15.7B FCF funding Security by Default across the Red Hat ecosystem, the IBM Software Security Platform Engineer should negotiate for the highest premiums available — this is the single role most directly responsible for delivering IBM's Security by Default vision.

As the Security Platform Engineer, you don't just contribute to Security by Default — you define it. Your architectural decisions determine what Security by Default means in practice: which security primitives are available, how they integrate with existing IBM Software and Red Hat products, and what the developer experience looks like for enterprise teams adopting the platform.

The February 5, 2026 integration report specifically calls out the need for "platform engineers who can bridge HashiCorp's security infrastructure with IBM's enterprise requirements and Red Hat's container platform." This is a direct description of your role. The report further notes that the success of IBM's $15.7B FCF target "depends on the rapid, reliable delivery of Security by Default capabilities" — capabilities that you architect and build.

Your negotiation language should convey the full weight of this responsibility: "The February 5, 2026 integration report confirms HashiCorp is the security backbone of IBM Software. With $15.7B FCF funding Security by Default across the Red Hat ecosystem, I negotiate for premiums reflecting this critical infrastructure role. As the IBM Software Security Platform Engineer, I am the architect of the Security by Default platform that IBM's entire enterprise strategy depends on. This role is unique — it didn't exist before the acquisition, and it is the most strategically important engineering position in IBM Software. I expect compensation that reflects this singular importance."

The combination of your role's strategic importance, the extreme scarcity of qualified engineers, and the direct line between your work and IBM's financial targets gives you leverage that few individual contributors possess.

#### Global Lever 1: Terraform & Infrastructure as Code

As the Security Platform Engineer, you define how Terraform integrates with the Security by Default platform — ensuring that every infrastructure provisioning action is secure by default. Negotiation language: "I define the Terraform security model for the entire IBM Software ecosystem. Every Terraform operation across IBM's 170,000+ enterprise customers passes through the security primitives I design. My architecture decisions determine whether IBM Software's infrastructure-as-code standard is truly secure by default."

#### Global Lever 2: Vault & Secrets Management

You own Vault's role as the security control plane for the entire IBM Software division. Negotiation language: "I architect Vault as the security control plane for all of IBM Software. The February 5, 2026 report identifies Vault as the most critical security component in the IBM portfolio — and I define its platform capabilities, integration patterns, and security architecture. Every secret, every certificate, every identity token in the IBM Software ecosystem flows through the platform I build."

#### Global Lever 3: Red Hat OpenShift Integration

You define the security integration architecture between HashiCorp and Red Hat at the deepest platform level. Negotiation language: "I architect the security integration between HashiCorp and Red Hat — defining how Vault integrates with OpenShift's security model, how Terraform interacts with Ansible, and how Consul connects with Red Hat Service Interconnect. This integration creates the most comprehensive enterprise infrastructure and security platform in the world, and I am its architect."

#### Global Lever 4: IBM Enterprise Distribution

You build the platform capabilities that enable IBM to distribute Security by Default to its entire enterprise customer base. Negotiation language: "My platform work enables IBM to offer Security by Default as a standard capability to every enterprise customer. The compliance frameworks I build, the security certifications I achieve, and the platform APIs I design determine whether IBM can sell HashiCorp products to its most regulated and demanding customers — government, financial services, healthcare, and defense."

#### Global Lever 5: Cross-Ecosystem Security Standards

This role uniquely defines security standards that span three major platforms. Negotiation language: "I define the security standards that govern the HashiCorp, IBM Cloud, and Red Hat ecosystems simultaneously. This cross-ecosystem standards work requires a level of breadth and depth that no other role in the industry demands. My security standards are adopted by thousands of enterprise customers worldwide."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $298,000 base with 2,200 IBM RSUs ($572,000 at IBM ~$260). Accept-at floor: $650,000 total comp. Cite the February 5, 2026 integration report, IBM's $15.7B FCF, and Security by Default within the IBM Software division. Emphasize: "This is the single most strategically important engineering role in IBM Software — the Security by Default platform architect. Compensation should reflect the uniqueness and criticality of this position."
