### Freddy AI Engineer — Freshworks Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: The Freddy AI Engineer is Freshworks' most strategically critical hire — the specialist who builds and evolves the AI platform that powers intelligent features across every product in the $5B integrated SaaS suite, differentiating Freshworks against Zendesk, ServiceNow, and Salesforce.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Mateo / Bay Area (USD) | India (INR/USD equiv) | Europe (EUR/GBP) |
|-------|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $145,000–$200,000 | $40,000–$65,000 | €52,000–€78,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $200,000–$265,000 | $65,000–$100,000 | €78,000–€112,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $265,000–$350,000 | $100,000–$150,000 | €112,000–€155,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and 10% performance bonus. This role commands the highest compensation bands within Freshworks' engineering organization due to the combination of AI/ML expertise and cross-product platform knowledge. Freshworks (NASDAQ: FRSH) RSUs.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Freshworks

The Freddy AI Engineer role exists because Freshworks recognized that building a unified AI platform across multiple products — customer support, ITSM, CRM, and marketing — requires a dedicated engineering function that combines ML expertise with deep understanding of each product domain. This is not a standard ML engineering role — it is the synthesis of AI capabilities and business software that defines Freshworks' competitive strategy.

Freshworks' $5B market cap and 67,000+ customers provide the data foundation for Freddy AI. The platform processes millions of customer interactions, IT tickets, sales conversations, and marketing engagements — creating a cross-product dataset that enables AI models impossible to build with single-product data. Freddy AI Engineers leverage this unique data advantage to build intelligent features that no competitor can replicate.

The competitive pressure from Zendesk (AI-powered customer service), ServiceNow (Now Assist), and Salesforce (Einstein) makes Freddy AI an existential priority for Freshworks. The company must deliver AI capabilities that are as good or better than these larger competitors to maintain market position.

#### Freshworks Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Freshworks Internal Level | Typical YoE | Focus Area |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Freddy AI Engineer | FAE (IC4) | 3–5 years | Feature-level AI contributions |
| Senior Freddy AI Engineer | Sr FAE (IC5) | 5–8 years | Product-area AI ownership |
| Staff Freddy AI Engineer | Staff FAE (IC6) | 8–12 years | Cross-product AI architecture |
| Principal Freddy AI Architect | Principal (IC7) | 12+ years | Platform-wide AI strategy |

*Note: This role maps to premium compensation bands due to the combination of AI expertise and cross-product domain knowledge.*

### Freshworks Freddy AI & Integrated SaaS Suite Premium

As the Freddy AI Engineer, the AI platform is your entire negotiation thesis. You build the intelligence layer that differentiates every Freshworks product from competitors. Freddy AI is not a feature — it is a platform that spans customer support (intelligent routing, auto-resolution), ITSM (predictive incident management, automated workflows), CRM (lead scoring, conversation intelligence), and marketing (personalization, predictive campaigns).

The cross-product data advantage is your negotiation anchor. Freddy AI can learn from customer support interactions to improve CRM predictions, from ITSM patterns to enhance customer experience, and from marketing engagement to optimize sales outreach. This cross-product learning loop is unique to Freshworks' integrated suite approach.

Use this in every negotiation: "Freddy AI is Freshworks' primary competitive differentiator against Zendesk, ServiceNow, and Salesforce. I build the AI platform that powers intelligent features across every product. My compensation should reflect the strategic importance of Freddy AI and the unique cross-product data advantage that makes this work possible."

#### Global Lever 1: Freddy AI Platform

Core AI platform engineering: "I will architect and build the Freddy AI platform — the ML infrastructure that serves intelligent features across all products. From model training pipelines to inference services to cross-product learning, I build the AI foundation."

#### Global Lever 2: Freshdesk & Customer Support

AI-powered customer support: "I will build Freddy AI capabilities for Freshdesk — intelligent ticket routing, auto-resolution, sentiment analysis, and customer self-service. These AI features directly compete with Zendesk AI."

#### Global Lever 3: Freshservice & IT Service Management

AI for ITSM: "I will build Freddy AI capabilities for Freshservice — predictive incident management, automated categorization, knowledge article suggestion, and virtual agent capabilities. These features compete with ServiceNow's Now Assist."

#### Global Lever 4: Unified Platform & Cross-Product Integration

Cross-product AI: "I will build the cross-product AI capabilities that are unique to Freshworks' integrated suite — using patterns from support interactions to improve sales predictions, leveraging ITSM data to enhance customer experience, and connecting marketing signals to service quality."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $195,000 base with $145,000 in RSUs over 4 years. Your accept-at floor should be $250,000 total comp. Cite Freddy AI's strategic importance against Zendesk, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, the unique cross-product data advantage, and competing offers from AI labs or enterprise SaaS companies. For India roles, compensation follows competitive AI talent market in Bangalore/Chennai; for European roles, open at EUR 78,000 base. Push for larger RSU grants — Freddy AI's success will significantly impact Freshworks' stock price.
