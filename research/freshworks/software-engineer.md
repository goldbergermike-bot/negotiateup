### Freshworks Freddy AI & Integrated SaaS Suite Premium

Freddy AI is Freshworks' strategic bet — an AI platform that spans customer support, ITSM, CRM, and marketing. Unlike competitors that bolt AI onto individual products, Freshworks is building an integrated AI layer that learns across the entire suite. Software Engineers who can build and integrate AI features across products are creating the differentiation that justifies Freshworks' competitive position against Zendesk, ServiceNow, and Salesforce.

The integrated suite approach creates engineering challenges that are unique to Freshworks: shared data models, cross-product workflows, and consistent AI capabilities across products. Engineers who can work across this breadth while maintaining depth in specific areas are especially valuable.

Use this framing: "Freshworks' integrated suite approach — with Freddy AI connecting customer support, ITSM, CRM, and marketing — creates engineering challenges that are unique in the industry. My ability to build [cross-product features / AI integrations / shared infrastructure] directly supports the suite strategy that differentiates Freshworks from point-solution competitors."

#### Global Lever 1: Freddy AI Platform

Freddy AI is Freshworks' competitive moat: "I will build Freddy AI capabilities that span the entire product suite. My experience with [ML systems / NLP / conversational AI] enables me to create intelligent features that differentiate Freshworks from Zendesk and ServiceNow."

#### Global Lever 2: Freshdesk & Customer Support

Freshdesk is Freshworks' flagship product: "I will build and enhance Freshdesk — the customer support platform that competes directly with Zendesk. My experience in [ticketing systems / real-time communication / workflow automation] directly improves the core product."

#### Global Lever 3: Freshservice & IT Service Management

Freshservice competes with ServiceNow in ITSM: "I will build Freshservice capabilities that help enterprises manage their IT operations. My experience with [ITSM workflows / asset management / enterprise SaaS] accelerates this growth vector."

#### Global Lever 4: Unified Platform & Cross-Product Integration

The integrated suite is the strategy: "I will build the shared infrastructure and cross-product integrations that make Freshworks' suite work as a unified platform. My experience with [platform engineering / API design / data integration] enables the suite strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $170,000 base with $110,000 in RSUs over 4 years. Your accept-at floor should be $215,000 total comp. Cite the Freddy AI strategic importance, the integrated suite engineering complexity, and competing offers from Zendesk or ServiceNow. For India roles, compensation follows local market (competitive for Bangalore/Chennai); for European roles, open at EUR 68,000 base.
