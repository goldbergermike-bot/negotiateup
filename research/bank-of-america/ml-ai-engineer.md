### ML/AI Engineer | Bank of America Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $340B market cap bank + AI investment across Erica, fraud, risk + Charlotte HQ cost advantage + Banks pay premium for ML talent | BofA AI strategy is board-level priority | **AI TRANSFORMATION PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Charlotte (HQ) | $145K–$200K | $45K–$110K/yr | 18–28% | $200K–$320K |
| New York City | $155K–$215K | $50K–$125K/yr | 18–28% | $215K–$350K |
| San Francisco | $150K–$210K | $48K–$120K/yr | 18–28% | $210K–$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Bank of America has made AI and machine learning a strategic priority, deploying ML models across fraud detection (saving billions annually), credit risk assessment, customer personalization through Erica, and trading analytics. ML/AI Engineers at BofA design and deploy production machine learning systems that operate under the strict constraints of financial regulation, including model explainability requirements, fair lending compliance, and real-time performance standards. The bank's AI footprint continues to expand as CEO Brian Moynihan has made digital transformation a cornerstone of BofA's competitive strategy.

ML/AI Engineers hold VP or SVP Technology titles, with compensation structured as base plus discretionary bonus (18-28% at VP, 25-40% at SVP) plus deferred compensation. BofA's AI teams work across Consumer & Wealth Management Technology (Erica, personalization), Global Risk Analytics (credit, market, operational risk models), and Global Markets Technology (trading signals, market microstructure). Compensation for ML roles tends to run 10-15% above general software engineering bands within BofA, reflecting the scarcity of ML engineering talent in financial services.

Competition comes from hedge funds (Two Sigma, Citadel), Big Tech (Google, Meta, Apple), and other banks (JPMorgan AI Research, Capital One ML). BofA's recruiter teams can offer above-band packages for candidates with production ML deployment experience, particularly in NLP, computer vision for document processing, or reinforcement learning for trading systems.

**The Financial AI Premium**

ML engineering in financial services operates under constraints that make the work uniquely challenging and valuable. Models must be explainable to regulators, resistant to adversarial attacks that could enable fraud, and compliant with fair lending laws that prohibit discriminatory outcomes. BofA's ML engineers must also navigate model risk management (MRM) governance, where every production model undergoes independent validation before deployment. Engineers who can build models that satisfy both performance and regulatory requirements are rare and command premium compensation.

BofA's fraud detection ML systems alone prevent billions in losses annually, providing clear ROI attribution for ML engineering teams. The bank has been expanding its use of generative AI for document processing, customer service automation, and code generation, creating new roles and additional demand for ML engineers. Candidates with experience in production ML systems, model monitoring and drift detection, or responsible AI/fairness frameworks have particularly strong negotiating positions.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Two Sigma/Capital One] at $[X] total comp for an ML engineering role. I'm drawn to BofA's financial AI challenges, but the compensation gap is material. Can we increase the base to $[target] and structure a guaranteed bonus of [X]%?"
2. **Revenue Impact:** "ML models in fraud detection, credit risk, and personalization directly impact BofA's bottom line by billions annually. The revenue attribution of this role justifies an above-band package with base of $[target]."
3. **Regulatory ML Expertise:** "My experience building [explainable ML/fair lending compliant models/production ML with MRM governance] is directly applicable to BofA's requirements and extremely scarce. This expertise commands $[X] at competitors."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation at my current company. A sign-on bonus of $[40K-70K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about applying ML to BofA's financial challenges at scale. I have a competing offer from [Capital One/Google] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose BofA, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $55K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider the alternative."
