**Negotiation DNA**

Bank of America employs over 95,000 technology professionals, making it one of the largest technology employers in the world. Engineering Managers at BofA lead teams of 8-25+ engineers across consumer banking technology, wealth management platforms, global markets systems, and enterprise infrastructure. The EM role at BofA typically carries an SVP or Director title and is responsible for people management, technical direction, delivery execution, and budget management. EMs in banking are expected to navigate both technology complexity and the highly regulated financial services environment.

Compensation for Engineering Managers is heavily weighted toward the bonus component, which is characteristic of banking culture. Base salaries are competitive but the annual discretionary bonus (20-35% at SVP, 30-50%+ at Director) and deferred compensation create significant total comp upside. BofA EMs also receive management-tier benefits including supplemental retirement contributions, enhanced healthcare, and executive development programs. The bonus pool is influenced by bank-wide financial performance, divisional results, and individual ratings.

Competition for engineering management talent comes from JPMorgan Chase, Capital One, Big Tech companies, and fintech firms. BofA has been investing in strengthening its technology leadership bench, and recruiters have flexibility to offer competitive packages for candidates who bring both technical credibility and people management experience. Candidates with experience managing teams through cloud migrations or building AI/ML platforms are particularly valued.

**Level Mapping:** Engineering Manager at BofA (SVP/Director) = L6-L7 at Google, M1-M2 at Meta, SDM-Principal SDM at Amazon, Director at Capital One, SVP/MD at JPMorgan

**The Banking Leadership Premium**

Engineering Managers in financial services carry broader accountability than their tech company counterparts. In addition to standard people management and technical leadership, BofA EMs must ensure regulatory compliance across their teams' output, manage vendor relationships and outsourcing decisions, navigate complex stakeholder environments spanning business, risk, and compliance functions, and maintain audit-ready documentation. This expanded scope justifies premium compensation relative to the individual contributor track.

BofA's technology transformation under CIO Aditya Bhasin has emphasized building a strong internal engineering culture and reducing dependence on contractors. EMs who can attract and retain top engineering talent, reduce contractor ratios, and drive modern engineering practices are strategic assets. The bank's management hierarchy also creates career progression opportunities: SVP to Director to Managing Director, each with meaningful compensation step-ups. Candidates should emphasize their ability to build and retain high-performing teams, which is BofA's top priority for technology leadership.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Capital One/Google/JPMorgan] at $[X] total comp for an engineering management role. I'm drawn to BofA's transformation program, but the total comp gap is significant. Can we increase the base to $[target] and guarantee the first-year bonus at [X]%?"
2. **Team Building Track Record:** "In my current role, I've built and retained a team of [X] engineers with [Y]% retention, reduced contractor dependency by [Z]%, and delivered [key programs]. This leadership capability is what BofA needs for its technology transformation -- it justifies an above-band package."
3. **Scope and Scale:** "Managing [X]+ engineers across [banking domains] with regulatory compliance responsibility is significantly broader than a typical EM role. The scope of this position warrants Director-level compensation at minimum, with a base of $[target] and bonus target of [X]%."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested equity/deferred comp at my current company. A sign-on bonus of $[50K-90K] would make the transition financially viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target and $[Z]K in deferred comp. I'm excited about leading technology teams at BofA's scale. I want to be transparent -- I have a competing offer from [Capital One/JPMorgan] at $[W]K total comp. To choose BofA, I'd need the base at $[X+20K], a guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $70K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
