**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Bank of America (SVP or Director titles) coordinate complex, multi-team technology programs that span cloud migration, regulatory technology implementation, digital banking initiatives, and infrastructure modernization. BofA's technology organization of 95,000+ people requires sophisticated program management to deliver cross-functional initiatives on time, on budget, and in compliance with regulatory requirements. TPMs at BofA serve as the connective tissue between engineering, product, risk, compliance, and business stakeholders.

Compensation follows the standard BofA structure: base plus discretionary bonus (18-28% at SVP, 25-40% at Director) plus deferred compensation. TPM compensation at BofA is generally aligned with senior SWE and product manager bands, reflecting the technical depth and organizational influence required. BofA TPMs often manage programs with budgets of $10M-$100M+ and must coordinate delivery across multiple engineering teams, vendor partners, and business lines.

Competition for TPM talent comes from Big Tech (Google, Amazon, Meta all have large TPM organizations), consulting firms, and other banks. BofA's scale advantage -- managing programs at one of the world's largest financial institutions -- provides experience that is valued across industries. Candidates with experience in regulated environment program management, cloud migration programs, or enterprise-scale technology delivery have the strongest negotiating positions.

**Level Mapping:** TPM at BofA (SVP/Director) = L5-L6 TPM at Google, E5-E6 TPM at Meta, Sr TPM-Principal TPM at Amazon, Director TPM at Capital One, SVP/ED at JPMorgan

**The Banking Program Management Premium**

Technical program management in banking carries complexity that exceeds most technology companies. BofA TPMs must navigate regulatory gate reviews, change advisory board approvals, audit documentation requirements, and cross-divisional governance structures that add significant coordination overhead. A cloud migration program at BofA, for example, involves not just engineering execution but also OCC approval processes, data privacy assessments, third-party risk evaluations, and business continuity certification -- all of which the TPM must orchestrate.

BofA's ongoing technology transformation has created sustained demand for experienced TPMs. The bank is simultaneously executing cloud migration, data platform modernization, AI/ML deployment, cybersecurity enhancement, and regulatory technology programs -- each requiring dedicated TPM leadership. This demand, combined with the scarcity of TPMs who understand both modern technology and banking regulatory frameworks, gives candidates significant negotiation leverage.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Amazon/JPMorgan] at $[X] total comp for a TPM role. I'm interested in BofA's transformation programs, but the total comp gap needs to be addressed. Can we increase the base to $[target]?"
2. **Program Scale Impact:** "I would be managing programs with $[X]M+ budgets impacting [Y] engineering teams. The scope and budget authority of this role justifies Director-level compensation with a base of $[target]."
3. **Regulated Delivery Expertise:** "My experience delivering technology programs in [regulated environments/banking/financial services] -- including navigating [regulatory approvals/audit requirements/change governance] -- is essential and scarce. This expertise commands $[X] at competing firms."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[40K-65K] would bridge the transition."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about driving BofA's technology transformation programs. I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose BofA, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $50K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
