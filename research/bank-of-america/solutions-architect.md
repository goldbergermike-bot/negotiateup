### Solutions Architect | Bank of America Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $340B market cap bank + Enterprise architecture across all business lines + Charlotte HQ cost advantage + Architecture critical to cloud migration | BofA SAs drive transformation strategy | **ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Charlotte (HQ) | $150K–$200K | $45K–$110K/yr | 18–28% | $200K–$320K |
| New York City | $160K–$215K | $50K–$120K/yr | 18–28% | $218K–$345K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Bank of America (SVP Technology or Director level) design the technical architecture for systems that span consumer banking, wealth management, global markets, and enterprise infrastructure. The SA role at BofA is particularly critical during the bank's multi-year cloud migration and platform modernization program, where architects must design solutions that bridge legacy mainframe systems with modern cloud-native architectures while maintaining regulatory compliance and operational resilience.

Compensation follows the standard BofA structure: base plus discretionary bonus (18-28% at SVP, 25-40% at Director) plus deferred compensation. Solutions Architects tend to be compensated at or above senior SWE levels, reflecting the breadth of technical knowledge, business domain expertise, and stakeholder management required. BofA's architecture organization works closely with the CTO office and has significant influence on technology investment decisions that can run into hundreds of millions of dollars.

Competition for architecture talent comes from cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), consulting firms (Deloitte, Accenture), and other large banks. BofA's scale advantage -- designing architecture for one of the world's largest financial institutions -- provides unique experience that is highly valued across the industry.

**The Banking Architecture Premium**

Architecture in financial services carries unique complexity. BofA Solutions Architects must design systems that satisfy regulatory requirements for data residency, disaster recovery (with near-zero RPO/RTO), audit trails, and cross-border data transfer restrictions. They must also navigate a complex technology estate that includes decades-old mainframe systems alongside modern cloud services, requiring expertise across a broader technology spectrum than most tech company architecture roles. This complexity justifies premium compensation.

BofA's cloud migration and API-first strategy creates urgent demand for architects who can design scalable, secure, and compliant solutions. Architects who can articulate a clear migration path from legacy to cloud while maintaining business continuity are among the most valuable technology professionals in banking. The bank's Enterprise Architecture organization has been empowered with budget and headcount to drive this transformation, giving hiring managers flexibility to offer competitive packages.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [AWS/Google Cloud/JPMorgan] at $[X] total comp for an architecture role. I'm drawn to BofA's transformation at scale, but the comp needs to reflect the market. Can we increase the base to $[target]?"
2. **Migration Expertise:** "My experience architecting [cloud migration/hybrid architectures/API platforms] for [regulated/enterprise] environments is directly applicable to BofA's transformation and difficult to source. This justifies a base of $[target]."
3. **Enterprise Scale Impact:** "As Solutions Architect, my decisions will influence technology investments worth $[X]M+ and impact systems serving 67M+ clients. This scope warrants Director-level compensation."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[45K-75K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about architecting BofA's next-generation platforms. I have a competing offer from [AWS/JPMorgan] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose BofA, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $60K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
