### Security Engineer | Bank of America Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $340B market cap bank + $1B+ annual cybersecurity spend + Charlotte HQ cost advantage + Banks are #1 cyber target = premium security comp | BofA security is existential priority | **CRITICAL SECURITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Charlotte (HQ) | $140K–$195K | $40K–$100K/yr | 18–28% | $190K–$305K |
| New York City | $150K–$210K | $48K–$115K/yr | 18–28% | $210K–$335K |
| San Francisco | $145K–$205K | $45K–$108K/yr | 18–28% | $200K–$320K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Bank of America spends over $1 billion annually on cybersecurity, making it one of the largest cybersecurity operations in the world. Security Engineers at BofA protect assets that include $3.2 trillion in client assets, 67 million consumer and small business clients, and critical financial infrastructure that is a constant target for nation-state actors and organized cybercrime. The Global Information Security (GIS) organization at BofA operates a 24/7 security operations center, manages threat intelligence, implements zero-trust architecture, and ensures compliance with an extensive regulatory framework.

Security Engineers hold VP or SVP titles, with compensation structured as base plus discretionary bonus (18-28% at VP) plus deferred compensation. Cybersecurity compensation at BofA has increased significantly over the past several years as the bank competes with defense contractors, cybersecurity vendors (CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks), Big Tech security teams, and other financial institutions for scarce security talent. The bank's CISO organization has direct board-level visibility, and security engineering is treated as a mission-critical function.

Competition for security talent is intense across all industries, but financial services security engineers command particular premium due to the regulatory requirements (OCC heightened standards, FFIEC, NY DFS 500) and the sophisticated threat landscape targeting banks. BofA recruiters have significant flexibility on compensation for candidates with expertise in application security, cloud security, threat hunting, or incident response.

**The Financial Security Premium**

Banks are the number one target for cyberattacks globally, and BofA's security team operates in a threat environment that is more sophisticated and persistent than virtually any other industry. Security engineers must defend against nation-state APT groups, sophisticated financial fraud operations, insider threats, and supply chain attacks -- all while maintaining compliance with banking-specific regulations that mandate specific security controls, incident reporting timelines, and third-party risk management practices.

BofA's $1B+ cybersecurity budget reflects the existential nature of security to banking operations. A single major breach could result in billions in losses, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage. This creates compensation pressure: BofA must pay at or above market to retain security talent, because the cost of losing experienced defenders far exceeds the premium compensation. Candidates with CISSP, OSCP, or cloud security certifications, combined with financial services experience, are in extremely short supply and can negotiate from significant strength.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [CrowdStrike/Google/JPMorgan] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to BofA's security operation scale, but the compensation needs to be competitive. Can we increase the base to $[target] and guarantee the first-year bonus?"
2. **Threat Landscape Expertise:** "My experience in [banking threat intelligence/nation-state defense/financial fraud detection] is directly applicable to BofA's threat landscape. This expertise is commanding $[X] at cybersecurity vendors and competing banks."
3. **Regulatory Security Knowledge:** "My background in [OCC compliance/NY DFS 500/FFIEC implementation] is essential for BofA's security program and extremely scarce. Candidates with combined technical security + banking regulatory expertise justify a base of $[target]."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on bonus of $[40K-65K] would make the transition financially viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about the scale and criticality of BofA's security operation. I have a competing offer from [CrowdStrike/JPMorgan] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose BofA, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $50K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
