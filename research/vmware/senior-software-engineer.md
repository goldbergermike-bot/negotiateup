#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at VMware/Broadcom

Senior SWEs (SMTS level) at VMware own architectural decisions for subsystems that enterprises depend on for their most critical workloads. Under Broadcom ownership (~$69B acquisition), VMware focuses on core enterprise products, giving senior engineers concentrated scope on high-impact work. AVGO RSUs provide strong equity upside.

#### Lever 1: Core Infrastructure Ownership

"I'll own subsystems within VMware's core infrastructure stack — hypervisor, networking, or storage. My systems engineering depth translates directly to architectural leadership on enterprise-critical technology."

#### Lever 2: AVGO Equity Negotiation

"Broadcom's AVGO has demonstrated exceptional growth. I want an RSU grant that reflects my senior-level impact, with upside potential from AVGO's continued performance."

#### Lever 3: VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF)

"VCF is VMware's flagship offering under Broadcom. My experience with integrated infrastructure platforms directly supports VCF's technical evolution."

#### Lever 4: Palo Alto Market Competition

"I'm evaluating offers from Palo Alto-area companies. VMware/Broadcom's offer must be competitive with senior roles at comparable infrastructure companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $195,000 base with AVGO RSUs valued at $80K-$110K/year. Accept-at floor: $280,000 total comp. Leverage AVGO equity attractiveness and infrastructure expertise.
