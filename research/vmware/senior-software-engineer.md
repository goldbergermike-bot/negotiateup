### Senior Software Engineer — VMware (Broadcom) Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Senior Software Engineers at VMware own critical subsystems within the virtualization, networking, and cloud infrastructure stack that runs the world's enterprise data centers, now with Broadcom's AVGO equity as part of the compensation package.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Palo Alto (USD) | Remote US (USD) | Bangalore (INR) |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Senior (SMTS/L5) | $230,000–$310,000 | $210,000–$290,000 | ₹42,00,000–₹68,00,000 |
| Senior+ (L5+) | $270,000–$345,000 | $250,000–$325,000 | ₹58,00,000–₹85,00,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary ($165K-$210K), AVGO RSUs (4-year vest), and performance bonus (10-15%).*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at VMware/Broadcom

Senior SWEs (SMTS level) at VMware own architectural decisions for subsystems that enterprises depend on for their most critical workloads. Under Broadcom ownership (~$69B acquisition), VMware focuses on core enterprise products, giving senior engineers concentrated scope on high-impact work. AVGO RSUs provide strong equity upside.

#### Lever 1: Core Infrastructure Ownership

"I'll own subsystems within VMware's core infrastructure stack — hypervisor, networking, or storage. My systems engineering depth translates directly to architectural leadership on enterprise-critical technology."

#### Lever 2: AVGO Equity Negotiation

"Broadcom's AVGO has demonstrated exceptional growth. I want an RSU grant that reflects my senior-level impact, with upside potential from AVGO's continued performance."

#### Lever 3: VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF)

"VCF is VMware's flagship offering under Broadcom. My experience with integrated infrastructure platforms directly supports VCF's technical evolution."

#### Lever 4: Palo Alto Market Competition

"I'm evaluating offers from Palo Alto-area companies. VMware/Broadcom's offer must be competitive with senior roles at comparable infrastructure companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $195,000 base with AVGO RSUs valued at $80K-$110K/year. Accept-at floor: $280,000 total comp. Leverage AVGO equity attractiveness and infrastructure expertise.
