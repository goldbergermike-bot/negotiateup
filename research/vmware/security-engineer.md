### Security Engineer — VMware (Broadcom) Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers at VMware protect the virtualization and cloud infrastructure stack that runs the majority of enterprise data centers — a uniquely high-value target where hypervisor vulnerabilities can compromise entire data center environments.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Palo Alto (USD) | Remote US (USD) | Bangalore (INR) |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $163,000–$225,000 | $148,000–$210,000 | ₹22,00,000–₹40,00,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $223,000–$303,000 | $208,000–$283,000 | ₹40,00,000–₹65,00,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, AVGO RSUs, and performance bonus (10-15%).*

#### Lever 1: Hypervisor Security Criticality

"VMware's hypervisor sits below the OS — a vulnerability here compromises every VM in the data center. My hypervisor and systems security expertise protects the most security-critical layer in enterprise infrastructure."

#### Lever 2: NSX Network Security

"NSX micro-segmentation is VMware's network security product. My network security engineering supports both NSX product security and VMware's internal network protection."

#### Lever 3: Enterprise Trust Protection

"Enterprises trust VMware with their most critical workloads. My security engineering directly protects this trust — any VMware security incident would affect millions of enterprise workloads."

#### Lever 4: AVGO Equity and Security Premium

"Security engineers with hypervisor-level systems security expertise are exceptionally rare. I expect AVGO RSUs reflecting both the security talent premium and infrastructure security specialization."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $183,000 base with AVGO RSUs valued at $70K-$95K/year. Accept-at floor: $255,000 total comp. Cite hypervisor security criticality and enterprise trust.
