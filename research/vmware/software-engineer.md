#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at VMware/Broadcom

VMware was acquired by Broadcom for approximately $69 billion in 2023, one of the largest technology acquisitions in history. Headquartered in Palo Alto, CA, VMware's vSphere, NSX, vSAN, and Tanzu product lines form the backbone of enterprise IT infrastructure worldwide. VMware's virtualization technology runs the majority of enterprise data centers.

Under Broadcom, VMware operates with a focus on its core enterprise customers and highest-value products. Software Engineers build the hypervisor, networking, storage, and multi-cloud management technologies that enterprises depend on. Post-acquisition, Broadcom's AVGO stock (one of the strongest performers in semiconductors) provides attractive equity compensation.

VMware competes for Palo Alto-area talent against the full spectrum of Big Tech and enterprise infrastructure companies. The combination of mission-critical enterprise technology, Broadcom equity, and deep systems engineering work creates strong negotiation leverage.

#### VMware/Broadcom Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| MTS (L3) | Member of Technical Staff | 1–3 years |
| MTS II (L4) | Member of Technical Staff II | 3–5 years |

#### Lever 1: Enterprise Infrastructure Dominance

"VMware's virtualization technology runs the majority of enterprise data centers worldwide. I bring experience building infrastructure-level software that must maintain the reliability and performance enterprises demand."

#### Lever 2: Broadcom AVGO Equity

"Broadcom's AVGO stock has been one of the strongest performers in tech. I want to ensure my RSU grant reflects my expected impact — AVGO's growth trajectory makes equity a particularly attractive component."

#### Lever 3: Multi-Cloud Strategy (Tanzu, VCF)

"VMware Cloud Foundation and Tanzu are critical to VMware's multi-cloud strategy. My experience with Kubernetes, cloud-native infrastructure, and hybrid cloud architectures directly supports these growth products."

#### Lever 4: Core Platform Engineering

"VMware's hypervisor, NSX networking, and vSAN storage products require deep systems engineering. My expertise in low-level systems programming, networking, or storage directly supports VMware's core technology."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $185,000 base with significant AVGO RSUs ($70K-$100K/year). Accept-at floor: $250,000 total comp. Cite enterprise infrastructure expertise and AVGO equity attractiveness.
