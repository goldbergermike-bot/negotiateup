#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at VMware/Broadcom

Data Engineers process telemetry from VMware's massive global deployment base. Under Broadcom (~$69B acquisition), data-driven decision-making drives product strategy and operational efficiency. The scale of VMware's infrastructure deployments generates enormous data volumes requiring specialized pipeline engineering.

#### Lever 1: Enterprise Telemetry at Scale

"VMware's global deployment base generates massive telemetry data. I build pipelines that process this data to drive product decisions and customer success at enterprise scale."

#### Lever 2: Product Analytics for Broadcom

"Broadcom values data-driven product decisions. My analytics pipeline expertise delivers the insights that drive VMware's product roadmap under Broadcom's focused strategy."

#### Lever 3: AVGO Equity Upside

"Broadcom's AVGO equity provides strong compensation upside. I expect an RSU grant that reflects my data infrastructure impact on VMware's product analytics capabilities."

#### Lever 4: Infrastructure Data Complexity

"Infrastructure telemetry is uniquely complex — spanning hypervisor performance, network flows, storage I/O, and cloud resource utilization. My expertise in infrastructure data modeling accelerates analytics delivery."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $180,000 base with AVGO RSUs valued at $65K-$95K/year. Accept-at floor: $250,000 total comp. Cite enterprise telemetry scale and AVGO equity.
