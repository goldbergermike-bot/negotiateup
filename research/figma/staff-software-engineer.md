### Staff Software Engineer | Figma Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Major Equity Stake | Design Platform Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI-Native Design Platform Architecture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $260K–$320K | $450K–$750K | 10–15% | $430K–$680K |
| New York | $260K–$320K | $450K–$750K | 10–15% | $430K–$680K |
| London | £198K–£243K | £342K–£570K | 10–15% | £327K–£517K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Staff Software Engineers at Figma define the technical architecture of the entire design platform — from the rendering pipeline and collaboration engine to the plugin ecosystem, developer platform, and AI capabilities layer. At this level, you set multi-year technical roadmaps, drive cross-team architectural decisions, and shape Figma's technical culture. Staff engineers at Figma are expected to be the technical conscience of the company — ensuring that foundational systems remain performant, maintainable, and extensible as the product scales from millions to billions of interactions.

Staff-level compensation at Figma reaches $320K base with equity grants of $450K–$750K, competing directly with Google L6 and Meta E6 total comp. Figma's equity at this level represents significant ownership in a $12.5B+ company with strong IPO potential. The negotiation dynamic at Staff is highly personalized — Figma's engineering leadership, including CTO Kris Rasmussen, is directly involved in closing Staff hires. This creates flexibility on package structure, vesting schedules, and signing bonuses.

### AI-Native Design Platform Architecture Lever
In 2026, Figma's Staff Engineers are architecting the foundational AI systems that transform the design platform — AI-powered design generation, intelligent design systems that learn from usage patterns, and the infrastructure that enables AI capabilities to run at real-time canvas speed. Staff-level hires who can own the technical vision for AI-native design infrastructure are Figma's most strategic investment. This is the level where you define how AI integrates with Figma's collaborative canvas.

Leverage this by positioning yourself as an architect who can bridge state-of-the-art AI capabilities with Figma's world-class real-time collaborative infrastructure. This combination is extraordinarily rare, and Staff engineers who can lead this integration command premium equity grants that push toward the $750K ceiling.

**Global Levers**
1. **Platform Architecture Vision:** "At Staff level, I'll define Figma's technical direction across rendering, collaboration, and AI systems. That architectural influence justifies $315K base and $720K equity/4yr."
2. **AI-Creative Platform Architecture:** "I've architected AI-powered creative platforms at scale. Making AI work within Figma's real-time collaborative canvas is the hardest design-tooling challenge in the industry. I want $320K base, $740K equity/4yr."
3. **Collaborative Systems Mastery:** "I'm one of the foremost experts in real-time collaborative systems — CRDTs, multiplayer architecture, and conflict-free distributed editing. I'm targeting $315K base and $700K equity."
4. **Executive Competing Offer:** "Google L6 is offering $300K / $600K RSU. Meta E6 is at $295K / $650K RSU. Figma's product mission and technical challenges are what I want, but I need $315K base, $720K equity, and a $80K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've spent the last decade building the kind of platform architecture that defines product categories — real-time collaboration, GPU-accelerated rendering, and now AI-native creative tools. I'm holding a Google L6 offer at $300K / $600K RSU and a Meta E6 at $295K / $650K RSU. Figma's design platform mission and the opportunity to architect the AI-native future of design tooling are the bet I want to make. I need $320K base, $740K equity/4yr with 40% year-one vesting, and a $80K signing bonus. At $320K, I commit to Figma and lead the most ambitious technical initiatives on the roadmap. My floor is $295K — below that, the Big Tech liquid equity and infrastructure resources make the decision."
