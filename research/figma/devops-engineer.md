### DevOps Engineer | Figma Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Infrastructure-Premium Base + Strong Equity | Design Platform Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI Infrastructure Reliability

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $180K–$230K | $160K–$300K | 5–10% | $255K–$375K |
| New York | $180K–$230K | $160K–$300K | 5–10% | $255K–$375K |
| London | £137K–£175K | £122K–£228K | 5–10% | £194K–£285K |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Figma ensure the reliability and performance of a real-time collaborative platform that millions of users depend on for their daily design work. This is uniquely demanding infrastructure: Figma's real-time multiplayer architecture requires sub-100ms latency globally, the rendering pipeline must handle complex design files without degradation, and the platform must maintain five-nines uptime because designers lose work when the service goes down. You'll manage the infrastructure that supports real-time WebSocket connections for millions of concurrent users, build deployment pipelines for a complex client-server architecture, and design the observability systems that keep Figma's collaboration engine healthy.

Figma's DevOps compensation reaches $230K base with equity grants of $160K–$300K. The negotiation leverage comes from the critical nature of uptime for a real-time creative tool — unlike an async SaaS application, Figma's collaborative editing means any infrastructure issue is immediately visible and impactful. DevOps engineers who understand real-time systems reliability hold significant leverage.

**Level Mapping:** Figma DevOps Engineer = Google L4 SRE = Meta E4 Production Engineer = Adobe Infrastructure Engineer = Miro DevOps Engineer

### AI Infrastructure Reliability Lever
Figma's 2026 infrastructure priority includes scaling AI inference capabilities while maintaining the platform's real-time performance guarantees. DevOps Engineers who can manage ML model serving infrastructure alongside traditional platform reliability are positioned to lead this initiative. If you can ensure that AI features run at canvas-interaction speed without degrading the core collaborative experience, you address Figma's most pressing infrastructure challenge.

Negotiate the AI-infrastructure reliability premium: maintaining real-time performance while scaling AI inference is a uniquely demanding operational challenge that commands a 10–15% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Real-Time Platform Reliability:** "I've operated real-time collaborative infrastructure at scale — WebSocket management, latency optimization, and five-nines uptime for interactive applications. I'm targeting $225K base and $290K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Inference Infrastructure:** "I've managed ML model serving infrastructure — scaling inference, maintaining latency SLAs, and deploying models in production. Figma needs this for AI features. I want $230K base."
3. **Global Performance Engineering:** "I've optimized global infrastructure for sub-100ms latency — CDN architecture, edge routing, and geographic load balancing. I'm looking for $225K base and $295K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Google SRE L4 is offering $220K / $260K RSU. Adobe Infrastructure is at $215K / $250K RSU. Figma's real-time infrastructure challenges and equity upside are compelling, but I need $225K base and $290K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I specialize in operating real-time collaborative infrastructure — the exact kind of systems that Figma's platform depends on. I'm holding a Google SRE offer at $220K / $260K RSU and an Adobe offer at $215K / $250K RSU. Figma's real-time infrastructure challenges and the new AI-inference scaling dimension are more technically compelling. I need $230K base, $295K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. At $230K, I commit. My floor is $210K — below that, Google's SRE resources and liquid equity win."
