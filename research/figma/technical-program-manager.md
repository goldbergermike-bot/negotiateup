**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Figma orchestrate the most complex cross-functional initiatives — from major platform releases and AI feature launches to enterprise capability rollouts and infrastructure migrations. This is a high-visibility TPM role in a company where product quality is non-negotiable: every release must meet Figma's legendary craft standard, which means program management must balance speed with the quality bar that millions of professional designers expect. You'll coordinate across rendering, collaboration, AI, platform, and enterprise teams to ship features that define the design industry.

Figma TPM compensation reaches $230K base with equity grants of $160K–$300K. The negotiation leverage for TPMs comes from demonstrating experience managing complex programs in craft-oriented product cultures — where quality gates are real constraints, not formalities, and where the release must delight professional designers who evaluate every interaction.

### AI Feature Launch Orchestration Lever
Figma's 2026 program management challenge is orchestrating the rapid launch of AI-powered design features — coordinating ML engineers, product designers, product managers, and enterprise teams through the unique development cycle of AI creative features. AI design feature launches are different from traditional software launches: they require model evaluation with design quality metrics, user trust testing, creative quality gates, and careful community communication about how AI integrates with the design process.

Negotiate the AI launch management premium: TPMs who can coordinate AI feature development in a quality-obsessed creative product culture are rare and command a 10–15% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Craft-Quality Program Management:** "I've managed programs in quality-obsessed product cultures — ensuring that speed never compromises the craft standard. I'm targeting $225K base and $290K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Product Launch Expertise:** "I've orchestrated AI product launches — coordinating model evaluation, quality gates, and stakeholder communication for AI features. I want $230K base."
3. **Creative Platform Release Management:** "I've managed releases for creative tools used by professional designers — understanding the unique quality and communication requirements. I'm looking for $225K base and $285K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Google TPM L5 is offering $220K / $275K RSU. Adobe TPM is at $215K / $260K RSU. Figma's product quality standard and AI launch complexity are more compelling, but I need $225K base and $290K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've managed complex programs in product cultures where craft quality is non-negotiable — the exact standard Figma sets. I'm holding a Google L5 TPM offer at $220K / $275K RSU and an Adobe TPM at $215K / $260K RSU. Figma's AI feature launch complexity and design-quality program management are more interesting. I need $230K base, $295K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. At $230K, I'm committed. My floor is $210K — below that, Google's TPM structure and liquid equity win."
