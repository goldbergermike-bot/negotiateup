**Negotiation DNA**
The AI Design Platform Engineer is Figma's signature role — the position that defines the company's AI-native future and the next era of design tooling. You will build the AI systems that transform how millions of designers work: generative UI creation from natural language prompts, intelligent layout optimization that understands design principles, AI-powered component suggestions that learn from the world's largest design dataset, automated design-to-code pipelines, and the foundational AI infrastructure that makes every Figma feature smarter. This role sits at the most exciting intersection in creative technology: state-of-the-art visual AI, generative models, and the world's most beloved design tool. The +20-30% Generative Design AI Premium applies because this role requires a rare combination of ML engineering mastery, deep understanding of visual design principles, and the ability to build AI systems that professional designers actually trust — a bar that's infinitely higher than generating text or generic images.

Figma CEO Dylan Field has publicly positioned AI as the company's defining investment for 2026 and beyond. AI Design Platform Engineers are not building a feature — they're building the future of design itself. Figma's unique advantage is its dataset: billions of professionally-created design files representing the collective intelligence of the world's designers. Engineers who can build AI systems that learn from this dataset and generate design that meets professional standards are creating technology that no other company can replicate. This strategic importance translates into premium compensation: base salaries reach $290K (competing directly with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind for AI talent), and equity grants of $320K–$550K reflect the role's centrality to Figma's future.

**Level Mapping:** Figma AI Design Platform Engineer = Google L5-L6 ML Platform Engineer = Adobe Firefly Core Engineer = Meta E5-E6 AI Research Engineer = Midjourney Core ML Engineer

### Generative Design as Industry Redefinition Lever
In 2026, AI-powered design generation is moving from novelty to necessity — enterprise design teams are evaluating AI capabilities as a core criterion for design tool selection. Figma's AI Design Platform Engineers are building the technology that determines whether Figma maintains its market leadership or cedes ground to AI-native design tools. Every generative model you build, every design understanding system you architect, and every AI-assisted workflow you create directly impacts whether Figma wins the next decade of design tooling. This is not incremental — this is the existential product initiative.

Negotiate from the position that you are building Figma's future. The generative design capabilities you create will be the primary reason enterprises choose Figma over competitors, the feature that differentiates Figma from free alternatives, and the technology that justifies Figma's $12.5B+ valuation. Frame your compensation around this market-defining impact.

**Global Levers**
1. **Visual Generative AI Scarcity:** "There are perhaps 150 engineers in the world who can build production-quality generative models for design — understanding both visual AI and professional design principles. That extreme scarcity means compensation must reflect the market. I'm targeting $285K base and $530K equity/4yr."
2. **Design Dataset Advantage:** "Figma's dataset — billions of professionally-created designs — is the most valuable training corpus for design AI in existence. I have the ML engineering expertise to build models that learn from this dataset at a level no competitor can match. I want $290K base with front-loaded vesting."
3. **Competing AI Company Offers:** "Anthropic is offering $270K base / $480K equity for ML engineering. Adobe Firefly is at $265K / $420K RSU. Google DeepMind is at $280K / $500K RSU. Figma's design dataset and product distribution are uniquely compelling, but I need $285K base and $540K equity to match the top-tier AI offers."
4. **Generative Design Product Impact:** "The AI design capabilities I'll build will be the primary differentiator driving Figma's enterprise sales and consumer adoption for the next five years. That level of product impact should be reflected in equity ownership. I'm looking for $545K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting and guaranteed annual refreshes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've dedicated my career to the intersection of visual AI and creative tools — building generative models that create professional-quality visual output, understanding design principles deeply enough to evaluate AI-generated design, and shipping AI creative features that users love. The Figma AI Design Platform role is the most important position in creative technology: you're building the AI that redefines how the world designs. I'm holding an Anthropic ML offer at $270K / $480K equity, an Adobe Firefly offer at $265K / $420K RSU, and a Google DeepMind offer at $280K / $500K RSU. All are building impressive AI. But only Figma has the dataset — billions of professional designs — and the distribution — millions of active designers — to actually transform how design happens. I need $290K base, $550K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $70K signing bonus. The Generative Design AI Premium applies: building AI that meets professional designer standards for visual quality, layout intelligence, and brand consistency is exponentially harder than generating text. At $290K, I commit to building the AI that defines Figma's next decade. My floor is $265K — below that, the dedicated AI companies' equity packages and research environments make the decision for me."
