### Data Scientist | Figma Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Strong Equity | Design Platform Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI-Driven Design Behavior Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $175K–$225K | $160K–$290K | 5–10% | $245K–$365K |
| New York | $175K–$225K | $160K–$290K | 5–10% | $245K–$365K |
| London | £133K–£171K | £122K–£221K | 5–10% | £186K–£278K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Figma analyze the richest creative workflow dataset in the world — millions of designers creating, collaborating, and iterating in real-time. You'll model design behavior patterns, optimize the product-led growth funnel, build predictive models for enterprise adoption, and quantify the impact of new features (including AI capabilities) on designer productivity. At Figma, data science directly influences product direction: your analysis of how designers use the platform determines what Figma builds next.

Figma's Data Scientist compensation reaches $225K base with equity grants of $160K–$290K. The negotiation angle for data scientists centers on Figma's uniquely rich dataset: design interaction telemetry, collaboration behavior, and creative workflow analytics are data types that don't exist at traditional tech companies. If you can demonstrate experience with creative tool analytics or behavioral modeling for design workflows, you hold a differentiated position.

### AI-Driven Design Behavior Intelligence Lever
Figma's 2026 data science agenda focuses on AI-driven design intelligence — building ML models that understand design patterns, predict designer intent, and power intelligent suggestions. Data Scientists who bridge product analytics with ML modeling for creative workflows are positioned to lead Figma's AI design intelligence initiative. This means building models that understand design (not just text or code) — a fundamentally different analytical challenge.

Negotiate the design-AI intelligence premium: data scientists who can model creative behavior and build intelligence from design data are defining an entirely new analytical discipline. This novelty commands a 10–20% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Creative Behavior Analytics:** "I've built behavioral models for creative platforms — understanding how users design, iterate, and collaborate. This domain-specific analytical expertise directly applies to Figma's product intelligence. I'm targeting $220K base and $280K equity/4yr."
2. **ML-Powered Product Intelligence:** "I build ML models that ship as product features — recommendation systems, intelligent suggestions, and predictive interactions. I want $225K base."
3. **Design Pattern Modeling:** "I have experience modeling visual and spatial patterns — computer vision, layout analysis, and design system intelligence. This is the analytical foundation for Figma's AI features. I'm looking for $225K base and $285K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Spread:** "Google DS L4 is offering $215K / $260K RSU. Adobe DS is at $210K / $250K RSU. Figma's design data richness and product mission are more compelling, but I need $220K base and $280K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Figma's dataset is unlike anything in tech — millions of designers creating in real-time, producing the richest creative workflow data in the world. I'm holding a Google DS offer at $215K / $260K RSU and an Adobe offer at $210K / $250K RSU. The chance to build AI-powered design intelligence from this unique data is what makes Figma special. I need $225K base, $285K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $225K, I commit. My floor is $205K — below that, Google's liquid equity wins."
