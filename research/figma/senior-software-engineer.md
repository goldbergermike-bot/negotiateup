### Senior Software Engineer | Figma Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Top-Tier Base + Significant Equity | Design Platform Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI-Native Design Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $210K–$270K | $280K–$500K | 5–10% | $350K–$530K |
| New York | $210K–$270K | $280K–$500K | 5–10% | $350K–$530K |
| London | £160K–£205K | £213K–£380K | 5–10% | £266K–£403K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Figma own critical subsystems of the design platform — the rendering engine, real-time collaboration infrastructure, plugin runtime, developer platform APIs, or the emerging AI capabilities layer. At this level, Figma expects you to set technical direction, mentor across teams, and make architectural decisions that impact the performance and reliability of a product used by millions. Senior engineers at Figma also serve as technical ambassadors — contributing to the engineering blog, speaking at conferences, and representing Figma's technical excellence to the industry.

Senior SWE compensation at Figma is benchmarked against Google L5 and Meta E5, with base salaries reaching $270K and equity grants of $280K–$500K reflecting meaningful ownership in one of the most valuable private companies. The negotiation dynamic at Senior level: Figma's product quality and engineering culture are strong retention tools, but the company knows that senior engineers have the most Big Tech optionality. Demonstrate depth in Figma-relevant technical areas (collaborative systems, GPU rendering, AI creative tools) to push toward the top of band.

**Level Mapping:** Figma Senior SWE = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Adobe Senior SWE = Canva Senior Engineer

### AI-Native Design Intelligence Lever
Figma's 2026 senior engineering agenda centers on architecting AI-native design capabilities — from AI-powered design generation and intelligent component suggestions to automated design-to-code pipelines and AI-assisted prototyping. Senior Engineers who can architect AI systems that integrate seamlessly with Figma's real-time collaborative canvas are the company's most strategic technical hires. If you can design ML inference systems that run at canvas interaction speed, you hold unique leverage.

Frame your negotiation around the AI-design platform premium: building AI that generates and manipulates design in real-time is an unsolved engineering challenge. Senior engineers who can bridge ML systems with high-performance creative tools command a 15–25% premium on equity grants.

**Global Levers**
1. **Collaborative Systems Architecture:** "I've architected real-time collaborative systems at scale — CRDTs, multiplayer infrastructure, and conflict resolution. This is Figma's core differentiator. I'm targeting $265K base and $480K equity/4yr."
2. **Performance Engineering Depth:** "I've optimized WebGL rendering, GPU compute, and browser performance at the limits of what's possible — the exact engineering that makes Figma's canvas world-class. I want $270K base."
3. **AI Creative Platform Premium:** "I've architected AI-powered creative tools — generative design systems, intelligent layout engines, and ML-powered UI generation. Figma's AI design vision needs this expertise at the senior level. I'm looking for $270K base and $490K equity/4yr."
4. **Big Tech Competing Offer:** "Google L5 is offering $255K base / $420K RSU. Meta E5 is at $250K / $450K RSU. Figma's engineering challenges and product mission are more compelling, but I need $265K base, $480K equity, and a $50K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've spent my career building the kind of systems that make Figma possible — real-time collaboration, GPU-accelerated rendering, and now AI-powered creative tools. I'm holding a Google L5 offer at $255K / $420K RSU and a Meta E5 at $250K / $450K RSU. Figma's product quality and the chance to architect AI-native design capabilities are what I want to invest in. I need $270K base, $490K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $50K signing bonus. At $270K, I commit to Figma and bring my systems architecture expertise to the platform's most critical challenges. My floor is $245K — below that, the Big Tech liquid equity packages are too strong."
