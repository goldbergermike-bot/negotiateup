**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Figma protect the design platform where the world's most valuable design intellectual property lives — from enterprise brand guidelines and unreleased product designs to sensitive client work and proprietary design systems. This is an extraordinarily high-trust security role: Figma's customers include virtually every Fortune 500 design team, and the platform contains design assets that are among the most confidential intellectual property in their organizations. You'll build security controls for real-time collaboration (ensuring that only authorized users can access designs), protect the plugin ecosystem from supply chain attacks, and ensure that AI features don't leak sensitive design data.

Figma's Security Engineer compensation reaches $245K base with equity grants of $180K–$320K. The negotiation leverage comes from the sensitivity of the data Figma manages and the enterprise trust that depends on security: enterprise design teams won't use Figma unless they trust it with their most confidential design work. Security engineers who understand application security for collaborative creative tools hold unique leverage.

**Level Mapping:** Figma Security Engineer = Google L4-L5 Security Engineer = Meta E4-E5 Security Engineer = Adobe Security Engineer = Canva Security Engineer

### AI Feature Security & Enterprise Trust Lever
Figma's 2026 security priority is ensuring that AI features don't compromise design confidentiality — that generative AI models don't memorize or leak proprietary designs, that AI training data is properly authorized, and that enterprise customers can trust AI-powered features with their most sensitive work. Security Engineers who bring AI security expertise are the highest-priority security hires as Figma expands its AI capabilities.

Negotiate the AI-design-security premium: the intersection of AI security, intellectual property protection, and creative platform security is an extremely narrow expertise that commands a 15–20% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Creative IP Security Specialization:** "I've built security architectures for platforms managing sensitive intellectual property — access controls, data loss prevention, and confidentiality guarantees for creative assets. I'm targeting $240K base and $310K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Security Premium:** "I have experience securing AI features — preventing model memorization, protecting training data, and ensuring AI outputs don't leak confidential content. This is critical for Figma's AI rollout. I want $245K base."
3. **Enterprise Compliance Expertise:** "I've led SOC 2, ISO 27001, and enterprise security programs for SaaS platforms with Fortune 500 customers. Figma's enterprise sales depend on these. I'm looking for $240K base and $315K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Spread:** "Google Security L5 is offering $235K / $300K RSU. Adobe Security is at $230K / $280K RSU. Figma's unique security challenges and equity upside are compelling, but I need $240K base and $310K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I specialize in securing platforms that manage sensitive creative intellectual property — the exact security challenge that defines Figma's enterprise trust. I'm holding a Google Security offer at $235K / $300K RSU and an Adobe offer at $230K / $280K RSU. Figma's unique AI-security challenges and enterprise trust mandate are more interesting. I need $245K base, $315K equity/4yr, and a $45K signing bonus. At $245K, I commit to building Figma's security foundation. My floor is $225K — below that, Google's security resources and liquid equity win."
