### Engineering Manager | Figma Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Leadership-Premium Base + Significant Equity | Design Platform Pioneer | 2026 Focus: Scaling AI-Native Design Engineering Teams

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $230K–$290K | $350K–$600K | 10–15% | $400K–$590K |
| New York | $230K–$290K | $350K–$600K | 10–15% | $400K–$590K |
| London | £175K–£221K | £266K–£456K | 10–15% | £304K–£449K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Figma lead the teams building the world's most popular collaborative design platform — from the rendering engine and collaboration infrastructure teams to the AI capabilities, developer platform, and enterprise features teams. This is a high-context EM role: you'll manage engineers solving uniquely challenging technical problems (real-time collaboration, GPU rendering, AI-powered design), navigate the balance between craft-driven engineering culture and scaling velocity, and build an engineering organization that maintains Figma's legendary product quality as the company grows. Figma EMs must be technically deep enough to evaluate architectural decisions while also creating the team culture that attracts and retains world-class engineers.

EM compensation at Figma reaches $290K base with equity grants of $350K–$600K. Figma competes for engineering managers against Google, Meta, and Apple — companies with established management structures and large liquid equity packages. The negotiation leverage for EMs comes from demonstrating the ability to build and scale high-performance engineering teams in craft-oriented, product-driven cultures.

### Scaling AI-Native Design Engineering Teams Lever
Figma's 2026 organizational priority is building engineering teams that can ship AI-native design capabilities at Figma's quality bar — teams that blend creative tool engineering expertise with AI/ML skills. EMs who have built and led teams at the intersection of creative tooling and AI are the company's most critical leadership hires. If you've scaled teams building AI-powered creative products, you hold unique leverage.

Position yourself as a leader who can recruit AI talent while maintaining Figma's design-quality engineering culture. This combination is rare and commands a 15–20% equity premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Craft-Culture Team Building:** "I've built engineering teams that maintain exceptional product quality while scaling velocity — exactly Figma's organizational challenge. I'm targeting $285K base and $580K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Team Leadership Premium:** "I've recruited and led engineering teams shipping AI-powered creative tools. Figma's AI design strategy needs this leadership. I want $290K base."
3. **Creative Platform Experience:** "I've managed engineering teams building creative tools used by millions — understanding designer workflows, creative tool performance requirements, and design-quality standards. I'm looking for $285K base and $570K equity/4yr."
4. **Big Tech Management Competing Offer:** "Google M1 is offering $270K / $500K RSU. Meta M1 is at $265K / $520K RSU. Figma's product mission and engineering culture are more compelling, but I need $285K base, $575K equity, and a $65K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've built engineering teams at the intersection of creative tooling and technical excellence — maintaining product quality while scaling organizations. I'm holding a Google M1 at $270K / $500K RSU and a Meta M1 at $265K / $520K RSU. Figma's product mission and the chance to build the AI-native design engineering organization are what I want to invest in. I need $290K base, $590K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $65K signing bonus. At $290K, I start building. My floor is $265K — below that, Big Tech management packages win."
