**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Figma build the pipelines and infrastructure that power platform analytics, usage intelligence, and the data foundation for AI/ML features. At Figma's scale — millions of active users creating billions of design interactions daily — the data engineering challenge is massive: processing real-time collaboration telemetry, building usage analytics that inform product decisions, and creating the data infrastructure that supports both business intelligence and ML model training. Your pipelines directly power Figma's product-led growth engine and the training data for AI design features.

Figma's Data Engineer compensation is benchmarked against top-tier tech companies, with base salaries reaching $220K and equity grants of $150K–$280K. The negotiation leverage for data engineers comes from the unique richness of Figma's data — design interaction telemetry, collaboration patterns, and creative workflow analytics represent a dataset that's unlike anything at traditional tech companies. If you bring experience with creative tool analytics, real-time event processing, or ML data infrastructure, you hold significant leverage.

### AI-Powered Design Analytics Lever
Figma's 2026 data engineering priority is building the infrastructure that powers AI design features — training data pipelines for design generation models, feature stores for intelligent design suggestions, and analytics systems that measure the impact of AI capabilities on the design workflow. Data Engineers who bring ML pipeline experience alongside traditional data engineering skills are positioned to own this critical initiative.

Negotiate the AI-data infrastructure premium: building pipelines that serve both analytics and AI model training for design-specific data is a rare specialization. This commands a 10–15% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Creative Platform Data Expertise:** "I've built data infrastructure for creative platforms — processing design interactions, collaboration analytics, and creative workflow telemetry at scale. I'm targeting $215K base and $270K equity/4yr."
2. **Real-Time Event Processing:** "I've designed real-time data pipelines processing billions of events daily — exactly the scale of Figma's collaboration telemetry. I want $220K base."
3. **AI Training Data Infrastructure:** "I build data pipelines that serve both analytics and ML model training. Figma's AI design features depend on this infrastructure. I'm looking for $220K base and $275K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Google Data Engineering L4 is offering $210K / $250K RSU. Adobe is at $205K / $240K RSU. Figma's unique data challenges and equity upside are compelling, but I need $215K base and $270K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Figma's data challenges are uniquely compelling — billions of design interactions, real-time collaboration telemetry, and the chance to build the data infrastructure for AI-powered design. I'm holding a Google L4 Data Engineering offer at $210K / $250K RSU and an Adobe offer at $205K / $240K RSU. Figma's data richness and product mission are what pull me here. I need $220K base, $275K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $220K, I'm committed. My floor is $200K — below that, Google's liquid equity and data infrastructure scale win."
