**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Figma design the tool that designers worldwide use to design — a meta-design challenge that demands the highest possible craft standard. Every interface decision you make is scrutinized by millions of professional designers who are expert users of design tools. You'll work on Figma's core editing experience, collaboration features, prototyping workflows, developer handoff, or the emerging AI-powered design capabilities. The bar for design quality at Figma is industry-defining: your work must be intuitive enough for beginners, powerful enough for enterprise design systems teams, and elegant enough to represent the gold standard of product design.

Figma's Product Designer compensation is among the highest in the design industry, with base salaries reaching $220K and equity grants of $150K–$280K. The negotiation leverage for designers at Figma is unique: you're designing the tool that defines the design profession, and your work quality directly impacts Figma's brand, competitive positioning, and product-led growth. Designers with a portfolio of complex creative tool design or who have experience designing for AI-powered workflows hold the strongest hand.

### AI-Augmented Design Workflows Lever
Figma's 2026 design vision centers on AI-augmented design workflows — interfaces where AI assists designers rather than replacing them, generating suggestions, automating repetitive tasks, and enabling new creative possibilities. Product Designers who understand how to design AI-augmented creative experiences (maintaining designer agency, handling AI uncertainty gracefully, and creating trust in AI suggestions) are the scarcest design talent Figma needs.

Position yourself as a designer who designs for AI collaboration: understanding how to make AI feel like a helpful partner, not a replacement, in the creative process. This human-AI interaction design expertise is the frontier of the design profession.

**Global Levers**
1. **Design Tool Design Expertise:** "I design design tools — I understand the meta-challenge of creating interfaces for professional designers. My craft standard matches Figma's. I'm targeting $215K base and $270K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Interaction Design Premium:** "I've designed AI-augmented creative workflows — interfaces that balance AI suggestions with human agency. Figma's AI design strategy needs this specific expertise. I want $220K base."
3. **Design Systems Leadership:** "I've designed and maintained enterprise design systems — component architecture, design tokens, and scalable design patterns. I'm looking for $215K base and $275K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Adobe is offering $210K / $250K RSU. Google UX L4 is at $205K / $240K RSU. Figma's design culture and the unique challenge of designing the designer's tool are compelling, but I need $215K base and $270K equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a designer who designs for designers — I understand the craft standard Figma demands and the unique challenge of creating tools that professional designers trust and love. I'm holding an Adobe offer at $210K / $250K RSU and a Google UX offer at $205K / $240K RSU. Figma's design culture and the chance to shape AI-augmented design workflows are what make this the role I want. I need $220K base, $275K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $220K, I'm in. My floor is $200K — below that, Adobe's creative-tool mission and liquid equity win."
