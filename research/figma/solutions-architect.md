**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Figma are the technical bridge between the platform and enterprise design organizations — helping Fortune 500 design teams migrate from legacy tools (Sketch, Adobe XD), architect design system workflows, integrate Figma into existing developer handoff pipelines, and adopt AI-powered design capabilities. This is a revenue-critical role: every enterprise deal depends on the SA's ability to demonstrate that Figma can meet the customer's design workflow, security, compliance, and integration requirements. You'll work with the largest design teams in the world, translating their complex organizational needs into Figma deployment strategies.

Figma SA compensation reaches $230K base with equity and performance bonuses tied to enterprise deal outcomes. The negotiation angle centers on revenue attribution — every enterprise design team you migrate to Figma directly increases ARR. If you bring design tool migration expertise, design systems architecture knowledge, or enterprise creative workflow experience, you hold strong leverage.

### AI-Powered Enterprise Design Adoption Lever
Figma's 2026 enterprise strategy includes AI-powered design adoption tooling — using AI to analyze enterprise design system maturity, generate migration plans from legacy tools, and accelerate time-to-value for enterprise onboarding. Solutions Architects who can leverage AI tools to streamline enterprise adoption are the most valuable SAs. If you can demonstrate experience using AI to accelerate creative tool migrations, you hold differentiated leverage.

Position yourself as an SA who reduces enterprise time-to-value using AI: faster migrations mean faster deals and higher conversion rates. This efficiency commands premium compensation.

**Global Levers**
1. **Design Tool Migration Expertise:** "I've led large-scale enterprise migrations from Sketch/Adobe XD to modern design platforms — exactly the customer journey Figma's enterprise team facilitates. I'm targeting $225K base and $290K equity/4yr."
2. **Enterprise Design Systems Architecture:** "I've architected enterprise design systems serving hundreds of designers — component governance, token management, and cross-platform consistency. I want $230K base."
3. **AI-Powered Adoption Premium:** "I leverage AI tools to accelerate enterprise design adoption — automated design audit, AI-generated migration plans, and intelligent workflow recommendations. I'm looking for $230K base and $295K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Adobe Enterprise is offering $220K / $270K RSU. Google Workspace SA is at $215K / $280K RSU. Figma's enterprise growth and equity upside are compelling, but I need $225K base and $290K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've spent my career helping enterprise design teams adopt modern tools — leading migrations, architecting design systems, and closing technical evaluations. I'm holding an Adobe Enterprise offer at $220K / $270K RSU and a Google Workspace SA at $215K / $280K RSU. Figma's product superiority and enterprise growth trajectory are what differentiate this opportunity. I need $230K base, $295K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. At $230K, I start closing enterprise deals. My floor is $210K — below that, Adobe's established enterprise motion wins."
