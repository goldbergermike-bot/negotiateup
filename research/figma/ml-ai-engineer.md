### ML/AI Engineer | Figma Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** AI-Premium Base + Significant Equity | Design Platform Pioneer | 2026 Focus: Generative Design & Visual AI

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $200K–$265K | $250K–$450K | 5–10% | $315K–$490K |
| New York | $200K–$265K | $250K–$450K | 5–10% | $315K–$490K |
| London | £152K–£202K | £190K–£342K | 5–10% | £240K–£373K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Figma build the intelligence layer that's transforming design — from generative design capabilities and intelligent layout suggestions to automated design-to-code workflows, visual search within design files, and AI-powered collaboration features. This is one of the most exciting ML roles in the industry: your models work with visual data (design files, UI components, layout structures) rather than text, meaning you're pushing the frontier of visual AI and multimodal machine learning. Every model you build ships directly to millions of designers, and your work defines what "AI-powered design" means.

Figma's ML/AI Engineer compensation reflects the extreme market premium for AI talent with base salaries reaching $265K and equity grants of $250K–$450K. The negotiation dynamic is highly favorable: Figma is building its AI capabilities from a position of massive product strength (millions of active users, the richest design dataset in the world), and ML engineers who can leverage this unique data and product position are in extraordinary demand. Figma competes for this talent against Google (Workspace AI), Adobe (Firefly/Sensei), and dedicated AI companies.

**Level Mapping:** Figma ML/AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta E4-E5 ML Engineer = Adobe ML Engineer (Firefly) = Midjourney ML Engineer

### Generative Design & Visual AI Lever
Figma's 2026 AI strategy centers on generative design — using AI models to generate UI components, suggest layouts, create design variations, and enable natural language-to-design workflows. This is fundamentally different from text generation: it requires understanding visual composition, design principles, spatial relationships, and brand consistency. ML/AI Engineers working on generative design at Figma are building models in a domain where few researchers and engineers have deep expertise, making this a high-scarcity, high-value specialization.

Frame your negotiation around the visual-AI premium: engineers who can build generative models for design (not just text or images) are defining an entirely new AI discipline. Figma's unique design dataset and product distribution make this the best place in the world to do this work, and that context justifies premium compensation.

**Global Levers**
1. **Visual AI Expertise:** "I've built ML models that understand and generate visual content — layout generation, component detection, and visual similarity search. This domain-specific AI expertise is exactly what Figma needs. I'm targeting $260K base and $430K equity/4yr."
2. **Generative Design Models:** "I have direct experience with generative models for design — UI generation, style transfer, and layout optimization. Figma's generative design vision needs this. I want $265K base."
3. **Multimodal ML Experience:** "I've built multimodal models that bridge text, images, and structured data — the exact capability Figma needs for natural language-to-design workflows. I'm looking for $265K base and $445K equity/4yr."
4. **AI Company Competing Offers:** "Adobe Firefly is offering $250K / $380K RSU. Google Workspace AI is at $255K / $420K RSU. Figma's design dataset and product distribution are uniquely compelling, but I need $260K base and $440K equity to match."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've built my career at the intersection of visual AI and creative tools — generative models for design, visual understanding systems, and multimodal ML. Figma's opportunity is unmatched: the richest design dataset in the world, millions of active designers to ship to, and the chance to define what AI-powered design means. I'm holding an Adobe Firefly offer at $250K / $380K RSU and a Google Workspace AI offer at $255K / $420K RSU. Figma's design data advantage and product mission are where I want to build. I need $265K base, $445K equity/4yr, and a $50K signing bonus. At $265K, I commit to building Figma's generative design capabilities. My floor is $245K — below that, the Big Tech liquid equity and research resources become the rational choice."
