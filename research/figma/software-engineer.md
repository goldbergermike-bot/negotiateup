### Software Engineer | Figma Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Top-Tier Base + Strong RSU/Equity | Design Platform Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI-Native Design Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $175K–$225K | $180K–$320K | 5–10% | $270K–$400K |
| New York | $175K–$225K | $180K–$320K | 5–10% | $270K–$400K |
| London | £133K–£171K | £137K–£243K | 5–10% | £205K–£304K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Figma build the collaborative design platform that millions of designers and developers use daily — from the WebGL-powered canvas rendering engine and real-time multiplayer collaboration to the plugin ecosystem, developer APIs, and the platform's emerging AI capabilities. Figma's engineering culture values deep technical craftsmanship: the product's performance, reliability, and interaction fluidity are competitive differentiators that depend on world-class systems engineering. SWEs at Figma work on uniquely challenging problems — real-time conflict resolution, GPU-accelerated rendering in the browser, and sub-millisecond collaboration latency across global users.

Figma's compensation is top-tier for a growth-stage company, reflecting its position as one of the most valuable private companies in tech (valued at $12.5B+ post-Adobe deal termination). Base salaries reach $225K, with RSU/equity grants of $180K–$320K over four years. The negotiation dynamic: Figma competes for talent against Google (Workspace/Docs), Apple (design tools), and Adobe — companies with massive compensation budgets. Figma wins on mission, product quality, and the unique technical challenges of building a collaborative design platform, but the compensation must be competitive to close top candidates.

**Level Mapping:** Figma SWE = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Adobe SWE III = Canva Software Engineer

### AI-Native Design Intelligence Lever
Figma's 2026 strategic priority is embedding AI into every layer of the design platform — AI-powered design generation, intelligent layout suggestions, automated design-to-code workflows, and AI-assisted collaboration features. Software Engineers who bring AI/ML experience alongside frontend or systems engineering skills are Figma's most sought-after technical hires. If you can build AI-powered creative tools, optimize ML model inference in the browser, or design real-time AI-assisted workflows, you hold differentiated leverage.

Position yourself at the intersection of creative tooling and AI: engineers who can make LLMs generate design, not just text, are defining an entirely new product category. This scarcity drives a 10–20% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Real-Time Collaboration Systems:** "I've built real-time collaborative systems — CRDTs, operational transforms, and conflict resolution at scale. This is Figma's core technical differentiator. I'm targeting $220K base and $310K equity/4yr."
2. **WebGL/GPU Rendering Expertise:** "I have deep experience with WebGL, GPU-accelerated rendering, and browser performance optimization — the foundational technology behind Figma's canvas. I want $225K base."
3. **AI Creative Tooling Premium:** "I've built AI-powered creative tools — generative design, intelligent layout, and AI-assisted workflows. This is Figma's highest-growth product area. I'm looking for $225K base and $315K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Google is offering L4 at $210K base / $280K RSU. Adobe is at $205K / $260K RSU. Figma's product mission and the technical challenges of the design platform are more compelling, but I need $220K base and $310K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about Figma because the technical challenges here are genuinely unique — real-time collaboration at scale, GPU rendering in the browser, and now AI-powered design intelligence. I'm holding a Google L4 offer at $210K / $280K RSU and an Adobe offer at $205K / $260K RSU. Figma's product quality and engineering culture are where I want to be. I need $225K base, $315K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $225K, I sign this week. My floor is $205K — below that, Google's liquid equity and infrastructure resources become the rational choice."
