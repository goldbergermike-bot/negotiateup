### Data Scientist | KPMG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | Lighthouse Analytics Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $120K-$170K | $0-$28K (senior only) | $12K-$34K (10-20%) | $132K-$232K |
| Chicago | $115K-$160K | $0-$25K (senior only) | $12K-$32K (10-20%) | $127K-$217K |
| London | £78K-£115K | £0-£18K (senior only) | £8K-£23K (10-20%) | £86K-£156K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at KPMG work within the Lighthouse center of excellence — building predictive models, statistical analyses, and AI-powered solutions for audit analytics, tax optimization, and advisory clients. KPMG Lighthouse has positioned itself as a leading analytics practice among the Big 4, and data scientists are at the core of this positioning. Data scientists at KPMG benefit from unique regulated industry exposure — building ML models for financial audit, tax compliance, and risk assessment. KPMG's comp is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. The Lighthouse brand commands a modest premium. The firm actively recruits PhDs and pays slightly above standard Big 4 tech rates for quantitative expertise. [Source: KPMG Lighthouse Data Science 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** KPMG Senior Associate / Manager (DS) = Google L4 DS = Deloitte Manager (DS) = PwC Manager (DS)

**Global Levers**

1. **Lighthouse Analytics Brand:** "KPMG Lighthouse is a recognized analytics brand. My data science work directly maintains the firm's competitive positioning in analytics consulting."
2. **Audit Analytics Innovation:** "ML models for audit — anomaly detection, risk scoring, financial statement analysis — directly improve KPMG's most regulated revenue stream."
3. **MBB Comp Gap:** "Data scientists at MBB earn $220K-$360K TC. KPMG's $132K-$232K is significantly lower. The gap should be narrowed through Lighthouse premium comp."
4. **PhD/Quantitative Premium:** "If holding a PhD: 'My doctoral expertise directly applies to Lighthouse analytics. The premium for this background should be 10-15% above standard band.'"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm joining KPMG Lighthouse as a data scientist — the firm's analytics center of excellence. I need $165K base with an 18% guaranteed bonus and a $15K signing bonus. MBB pays $250K-$350K for comparable DS roles." KPMG will counter at $145K-$155K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $195K.
