### Security Engineer | KPMG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | Cyber Security Practice

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $110K-$160K | $0-$22K (senior only) | $11K-$32K (10-20%) | $121K-$214K |
| Chicago | $105K-$150K | $0-$20K (senior only) | $11K-$30K (10-20%) | $116K-$200K |
| London | £75K-£115K | £0-£15K (senior only) | £8K-£23K (10-20%) | £83K-£153K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at KPMG work within the firm's Cyber Security practice — one of the Big 4's security consulting operations. KPMG's security practice serves financial institutions, government agencies, and Fortune 500 companies with security assessments, incident response, and managed security services. Security engineers also protect KPMG's internal infrastructure, which handles sensitive audit and financial data for thousands of public companies. KPMG handles material non-public financial information, making security critically important. Comp is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. The security talent scarcity gives you negotiation leverage despite KPMG's generally lower comp structure. [Source: KPMG Cyber Security Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** KPMG Senior Associate / Manager (Cyber) = Google L4 Security = CrowdStrike Senior = PwC Senior Associate (Cyber)

**Global Levers**

1. **Financial Data Protection:** "KPMG handles non-public financial data for thousands of public companies. A security breach could trigger SEC investigations and destroy the firm's audit practice."
2. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers are the most supply-constrained talent in tech. This scarcity gives me leverage even within KPMG's lower comp structure."
3. **Dual Practitioner/Consultant Value:** "I both protect KPMG's systems and advise clients on security. This dual skill set is valuable."
4. **Big 4 Security Peer Comp:** "Deloitte security engineers earn $138K-$240K TC; PwC $127K-$223K. KPMG should be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm protecting KPMG's financial data and advising clients on cybersecurity. I need $155K base with an 18% guaranteed bonus and a $15K signing bonus. Security talent is the scarcest in the market, and other Big 4 firms offer higher TC." KPMG will counter at $135K-$145K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $180K.
