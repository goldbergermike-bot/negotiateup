**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at KPMG lead technology delivery teams at the Director level — managing engineers for Lighthouse analytics, client consulting engagements, and internal platform development. At this level, KPMG's comp includes higher bonus (15-25%) and emerging equity grants. EMs are accountable for team delivery, utilization, and talent development. KPMG's smaller scale compared to Deloitte and PwC means each EM has more direct impact on firm-wide technology capabilities. The Director level is 2-4 years from Partner, making this a critical retention and investment point. KPMG has been hiring experienced EMs to build its technology management layer.

**Level Mapping:** KPMG Director = Google L5-L6 EM = Deloitte Manager/SM = PwC Director

**Global Levers**

1. **Partner Track Proximity:** "I'm 2-4 years from Partner ($400K-$1M+ comp). My current package should reflect this trajectory."
2. **Lighthouse Team Leadership:** "If managing Lighthouse engineers: 'I lead the team that builds KPMG's competitive differentiator. Lighthouse's success depends on my team's output.'"
3. **Equity Escalation:** "At the Director level, equity should be $45K+ over 4 years to signal commitment to my partner track."
4. **Big 4 EM Peer Comp:** "Deloitte EMs earn $198K-$310K TC; PwC $179K-$288K. KPMG should be competitive within this range."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm leading engineering teams and progressing toward Partner. I need $180K base, 20% guaranteed bonus, equity of $40K over 4 years, and a $20K signing bonus. Deloitte and PwC offer higher TC for comparable EM roles." KPMG will counter at $160K-$170K base with $22K-$30K equity. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $230K.
