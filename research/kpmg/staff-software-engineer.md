**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at KPMG map to the Director / Managing Director level — where comp includes equity grants and higher bonus (15-25%). At this level, you set technical direction for practice areas, lead multiple delivery teams, and represent KPMG's technology capabilities to clients and in competitive pitches. This is the pre-Partner level, with Partner promotion 2-4 years away. KPMG's equity grants at this level are modest but represent a commitment to retention. KPMG has been developing its technology leadership to compete with larger Big 4 firms and tech companies for senior technical talent. [Source: KPMG Technology Senior Leadership 2025-2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-Partner Investment:** "I'm 2-4 years from Partner, where comp reaches $400K-$1M+. My current package should reflect this investment trajectory."
2. **Practice Area Authority:** "I set technical direction for a practice area at a $36B firm. My decisions affect hundreds of engineers and significant engagement revenue."
3. **Equity Push:** "At this level, equity should be $55K+ over 4 years to signal the firm's commitment to my partner progression."
4. **Big 4 Peer Comp:** "Deloitte Directors earn $222K-$343K TC; PwC $198K-$315K. KPMG should be competitive within the Big 4 peer set."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm setting technical direction at the pre-Partner level. I need $190K base, 20% guaranteed bonus, equity of $50K over 4 years, and a $22K signing bonus. Deloitte and PwC offer higher TC for comparable roles." KPMG will counter at $170K-$180K base with $30K-$40K equity. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $250K.
