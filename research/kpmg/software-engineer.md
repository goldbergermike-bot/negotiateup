### Software Engineer | KPMG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | Big 4 Technology Practice

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $105K-$150K | $0-$20K (senior only) | $11K-$30K (10-20%) | $116K-$200K |
| Chicago | $100K-$140K | $0-$18K (senior only) | $10K-$28K (10-20%) | $110K-$186K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at KPMG build technology solutions for the firm's advisory, audit, and tax practices. KPMG ($36B revenue) is the smallest Big 4 firm but has invested significantly in technology — particularly through KPMG Lighthouse (data analytics) and KPMG Ignite (AI platform). Software engineers may work on client-facing engagements, internal platforms, or the firm's proprietary technology products. KPMG's comp structure is typical Big 4: lower base than MBB or tech companies, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. The partner track is the long-term wealth-creation mechanism. KPMG offers strong work-life balance relative to MBB and some Big 4 competitors. [Source: KPMG Technology Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** KPMG Associate / Senior Associate = Google L3 = Deloitte Analyst/Consultant = PwC Associate

**Global Levers**

1. **Career Progression Value:** "KPMG's structured promotion ladder offers clear progression from Associate to Partner. I'm investing in this long-term trajectory."
2. **Client Billing Revenue:** "KPMG bills my time at $150-$275/hour. At 1,500 billable hours, I generate $225K-$413K in revenue for the firm."
3. **Competitive Positioning:** "Accenture offers RSUs; Deloitte and PwC offer slightly higher base. KPMG needs to be competitive in the Big 4 market."
4. **Lighthouse/Ignite Opportunity:** "If my role connects to Lighthouse or Ignite, these premium practice areas command higher comp within KPMG."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building technology for KPMG's advisory and audit practices. I need $145K base with a 15% guaranteed bonus and a $10K signing bonus. Other Big 4 firms offer higher base or RSUs." KPMG will counter at $125K-$135K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $155K+.
