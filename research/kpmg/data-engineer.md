### Data Engineer | KPMG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | Lighthouse Data Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $110K-$155K | $0-$22K (senior only) | $11K-$31K (10-20%) | $121K-$208K |
| Chicago | $105K-$145K | $0-$18K (senior only) | $11K-$29K (10-20%) | $116K-$192K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at KPMG build data pipelines and infrastructure for the firm's Lighthouse analytics practice, audit data processing, and client consulting engagements. KPMG Lighthouse is the firm's competitive differentiator — a center of excellence for data analytics that serves audit, tax, and advisory clients. Data engineers at KPMG work across regulated industries (financial services, healthcare, government) where data infrastructure must meet stringent compliance requirements. KPMG's comp is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. The Lighthouse brand within KPMG commands a modest premium over standard technology roles.

**Level Mapping:** KPMG Associate / Senior Associate (Data) = Google L3 Data Engineer = Databricks Associate DE = PwC Associate (Data)

**Global Levers**

1. **Lighthouse Premium:** "I'm building data infrastructure for KPMG Lighthouse — the firm's flagship analytics practice. Lighthouse roles should command a premium over standard KPMG tech roles."
2. **Audit Data Compliance:** "Data infrastructure for audit must meet SOX, PCAOB, and other regulatory standards. This compliance complexity warrants a premium."
3. **Big 4 Peer Comp:** "Deloitte data engineers earn $121K-$228K TC; PwC $121K-$211K. KPMG should be competitive within the Big 4."
4. **GenAI Data Foundation:** "KPMG Ignite (AI platform) requires robust data foundations. Data engineers building GenAI infrastructure are in high demand."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building data infrastructure for KPMG Lighthouse. I need $150K base with a 15% guaranteed bonus and a $10K signing bonus. Deloitte and PwC offer comparable or higher TC." KPMG will counter at $130K-$140K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $160K+.
