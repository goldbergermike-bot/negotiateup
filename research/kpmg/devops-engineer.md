### DevOps Engineer | KPMG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | Cloud & Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $105K-$150K | $0-$20K (senior only) | $11K-$30K (10-20%) | $116K-$200K |
| Chicago | $100K-$140K | $0-$18K (senior only) | $10K-$28K (10-20%) | $110K-$186K |
| Bangalore | ₹10L-₹20L | None | ₹1L-₹4L (10-20%) | ₹11L-₹24L |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at KPMG manage cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and platform reliability for the firm's technology practice, Lighthouse analytics infrastructure, and client engagements. KPMG's cloud practice is growing as the firm builds digital transformation capabilities. DevOps engineers support both internal infrastructure (used across the firm) and client-facing cloud consulting projects. KPMG runs across AWS and Azure with strategic partnerships. Comp is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. KPMG offers strong work-life balance relative to some competitors, which is a non-financial benefit to consider.

**Level Mapping:** KPMG Associate / Senior Associate (Cloud) = Google L3 SRE = Amazon SDE I (Infra) = PwC Associate (Cloud)

**Global Levers**

1. **Lighthouse Infrastructure:** "I maintain the infrastructure that KPMG Lighthouse — the firm's flagship analytics practice — runs on. Lighthouse availability directly impacts client deliverables."
2. **Cloud Partnership Value:** "KPMG's cloud partnerships include certification programs and training that accelerate my career."
3. **Big 4 Peer Comp:** "Deloitte DevOps engineers earn $127K-$217K TC; PwC $121K-$200K. KPMG should be competitive within the peer set."
4. **Regulated Infrastructure Premium:** "Infrastructure supporting audit and tax systems must meet SOX and PCAOB standards. This regulatory complexity warrants a premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm maintaining infrastructure for KPMG Lighthouse and regulatory-compliant systems. I need $145K base with a 15% guaranteed bonus and a $10K signing bonus. Other Big 4 firms offer comparable or higher TC." KPMG will counter at $125K-$135K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $155K+.
