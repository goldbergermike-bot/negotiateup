**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at KPMG coordinate complex technology programs — Lighthouse platform upgrades, Ignite AI deployments, security overhauls, and client engagement delivery programs. KPMG's TPM role involves managing programs that span engineering, analytics, and advisory teams. The firm's smaller scale means each TPM owns a larger share of the critical program portfolio. Comp is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. TPMs who deliver high-visibility programs (Lighthouse launches, Ignite deployments) earn bonuses at the top of the range and are strong partner track candidates.

**Level Mapping:** KPMG Manager (TPM) = Google L4-L5 TPM = Amazon Senior TPM = PwC Manager TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Lighthouse/Ignite Program Delivery:** "I manage delivery of KPMG's most strategic technology programs. Lighthouse and Ignite launches depend on my program management."
2. **Broad Program Ownership:** "KPMG's smaller TPM team means I own more programs end-to-end. More scope should mean more comp."
3. **Regulated Compliance Programs:** "Technology programs at KPMG must meet audit and financial regulatory requirements — adding significant program complexity."
4. **Big 4 TPM Peer Comp:** "Deloitte TPMs earn $143K-$246K TC; PwC $132K-$223K. KPMG should be competitive within the peer set."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm managing KPMG's most critical technology programs. I need $155K base with an 18% guaranteed bonus and a $12K signing bonus. Deloitte and PwC offer comparable or higher TC for TPM roles." KPMG will counter at $135K-$145K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $185K.
