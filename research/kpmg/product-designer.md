### Product Designer | KPMG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | Digital & Innovation Design

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $100K-$140K | $0-$18K (senior only) | $10K-$28K (10-20%) | $110K-$186K |
| Chicago | $95K-$130K | $0-$15K (senior only) | $10K-$26K (10-20%) | $105K-$171K |
| London | £68K-£100K | £0-£12K (senior only) | £7K-£20K (10-20%) | £75K-£132K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at KPMG create the user experience for the firm's internal analytics platforms (Lighthouse), AI tools (Ignite), and client-facing digital products. KPMG's design practice is smaller than Deloitte Digital or Accenture Song, but growing as the firm invests in digital product delivery. Designers at KPMG face unique challenges: creating intuitive UX for complex analytical tools used by auditors, tax professionals, and consultants. The regulated environment adds design constraints (data sensitivity, compliance requirements) that require specialized UX thinking. Comp is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. [Source: KPMG Digital & Innovation Design 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** KPMG Senior Associate (Design) = Google L3 UX = Meta IC3 Designer = PwC Senior Associate (Design)

**Global Levers**

1. **Analytical UX Expertise:** "Designing complex analytical tools for auditors and tax professionals requires specialized UX skills. Few designers have this regulated-industry, data-heavy design background."
2. **Lighthouse/Ignite Design:** "If designing for Lighthouse or Ignite: 'I'm shaping the UX of KPMG's flagship technology products. These products define the firm's digital brand.'"
3. **Tech Company Design Gap:** "Product designers at Google, Figma, and Airbnb earn $200K-$320K TC. KPMG's gap is significant but partially offset by work-life balance."
4. **Small Team Impact:** "KPMG's design team is lean, giving me more ownership and direct product impact than larger consulting design teams."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm designing KPMG's flagship analytics and AI products. I need $135K base with a 15% guaranteed bonus and a $10K signing bonus. Other Big 4 design roles pay $116K-$211K TC." KPMG will counter at $118K-$128K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $150K+.
