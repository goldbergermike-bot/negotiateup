### Solutions Architect | KPMG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (15-25%) + Equity at Senior Levels | Technology Advisory Architecture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $130K-$180K | $0-$40K (senior only) | $20K-$45K (15-25%) | $150K-$265K |
| Chicago | $125K-$165K | $0-$35K (senior only) | $19K-$41K (15-25%) | $144K-$241K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at KPMG design technology architectures for client consulting engagements — enterprise transformations, cloud migrations, and digital modernization projects. SAs at KPMG operate at the Director level, with enhanced bonus (15-25%) and emerging equity grants. They serve as the technical authority for engagements and contribute to pre-sales. KPMG's SA role is particularly strong in data analytics architecture (leveraging the Lighthouse brand) and in financial services and government sectors. KPMG's smaller scale means each SA has more direct influence on the firm's technology advisory positioning. [Source: KPMG Technology Advisory Architecture Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** KPMG Director (SA) = AWS Senior SA = Google Cloud Customer Engineer (L5) = PwC Director (SA)

**Global Levers**

1. **Lighthouse Architecture Brand:** "I design the technical architectures for KPMG Lighthouse deployments — the firm's flagship analytics capability. My architecture defines how Lighthouse delivers for clients."
2. **Engagement Revenue Enablement:** "My architecture work enables engagements worth $3M-$25M. My technical credibility helps KPMG win competitive pitches."
3. **Pre-Sales Contribution:** "My architecture presentations help KPMG win against Deloitte, Accenture, and cloud providers. I'm selling, not just delivering."
4. **Cloud Provider SA Benchmark:** "SAs at AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure earn $270K-$390K TC. KPMG needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm designing architectures for KPMG's client engagements and Lighthouse deployments. I need $175K base, 20% guaranteed bonus, equity of $35K over 4 years, and a $18K signing bonus. Cloud provider SA roles offer $290K-$370K TC." KPMG will counter at $155K-$165K base with $18K-$25K equity. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $225K.
