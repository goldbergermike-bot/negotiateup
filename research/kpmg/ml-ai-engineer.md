**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at KPMG build production AI systems for the Lighthouse analytics practice and the Ignite AI platform. KPMG Ignite is the firm's enterprise AI orchestration platform — designed to deploy GenAI solutions for audit, tax, and advisory clients. ML/AI engineers at KPMG work on high-stakes AI applications: financial anomaly detection for audit, tax compliance automation, and risk assessment models. KPMG's comp is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. The firm has been increasing AI investment significantly, creating demand for ML engineers who can build production AI systems in regulated environments.

**Level Mapping:** KPMG Senior Associate / Manager (AI) = Google L4 ML = Deloitte Manager (AI) = PwC Manager (AI)

**Global Levers**

1. **Ignite AI Platform:** "I'm building the AI platform (Ignite) that KPMG is positioning as its GenAI capability. My engineering work directly enables the firm's AI consulting practice."
2. **Regulated AI Expertise:** "Building AI for audit and tax — with SOX, PCAOB, and financial regulatory compliance — requires unique ML expertise. This regulated AI skill set commands a premium."
3. **AI Company Comp Gap:** "ML engineers at AI companies earn $350K-$550K TC. Even Big 4 peers like Deloitte offer $132K-$234K. KPMG should be at least competitive within the Big 4."
4. **Lighthouse Brand Premium:** "Lighthouse and Ignite are KPMG's premium technology brands. ML engineers on these teams should earn above standard KPMG tech comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building AI systems for KPMG Lighthouse and the Ignite platform. I need $165K base with an 18% guaranteed bonus and a $15K signing bonus. Deloitte's AI roles pay $143K-$251K TC." KPMG will counter at $145K-$155K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $195K.
