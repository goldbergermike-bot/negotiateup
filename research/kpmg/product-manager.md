**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at KPMG drive product strategy for the firm's Lighthouse analytics platform, Ignite AI platform, and internal technology products used across KPMG's audit, tax, and advisory practices. PMs at KPMG have significant influence because the firm's technology product organization is smaller — each PM owns a larger product surface area. KPMG's PM role is growing in importance as the firm invests in proprietary technology products to differentiate from other Big 4 firms. Comp is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. PMs who drive Lighthouse and Ignite product strategy earn at the top of the range.

**Level Mapping:** KPMG Manager (PM) = Google L4-L5 PM = Deloitte Manager PM = PwC Manager PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Lighthouse/Ignite Product Ownership:** "I own product strategy for KPMG's flagship technology platforms. These products define the firm's competitive positioning in analytics and AI consulting."
2. **Broad Product Scope:** "At KPMG, each PM owns a larger product area than at bigger Big 4 firms. I'm driving strategy for entire platform capabilities, not just features."
3. **Audit/Tax Product Revenue:** "Products that improve audit and tax delivery impact KPMG's two largest revenue streams. My product decisions have massive revenue implications."
4. **Tech PM Comp Gap:** "PMs at Google, Meta, and Stripe earn $300K-$450K TC. Big 4 peers offer $132K-$257K. KPMG should be competitive within the Big 4."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm driving product strategy for KPMG Lighthouse and Ignite. I need $160K base with an 18% guaranteed bonus and a $15K signing bonus. Deloitte PM roles pay $149K-$257K TC." KPMG will counter at $140K-$150K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $190K.
