### Senior Software Engineer | KPMG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | Manager Level

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $120K-$160K | $0-$25K (senior only) | $12K-$32K (10-20%) | $132K-$217K |
| Chicago | $115K-$150K | $0-$22K (senior only) | $12K-$30K (10-20%) | $127K-$202K |
| London | £80K-£115K | £0-£15K (senior only) | £8K-£23K (10-20%) | £88K-£153K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at KPMG lead technical delivery for client engagements and internal platform development at the Manager level. KPMG's technology practice is growing, with particular investment in data analytics (Lighthouse) and AI (Ignite). Senior engineers at KPMG are expected to own technical design, lead delivery teams, and work with advisory partners on technology strategy. KPMG's comp at this level is competitive within the Big 4 but trails tech companies significantly. Bonus ranges 10-20%, with strong performers at 15-20%. The partner track value becomes increasingly important at this level — frame negotiations around both immediate comp and long-term career economics. [Source: KPMG Technology Career Track 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** KPMG Manager = Google L4-L5 = Deloitte Manager = PwC Manager

**Global Levers**

1. **Client Delivery Value:** "I lead technical delivery for engagements worth $1M-$6M. My decisions directly affect client satisfaction and engagement profitability."
2. **Lighthouse/Ignite Connection:** "If connected to Lighthouse or Ignite: 'I'm part of KPMG's premium analytics/AI practice, which commands higher comp within the firm.'"
3. **Retention Critical Level:** "Senior/Manager level is KPMG's biggest retention risk. Tech companies recruit aggressively at this level. The firm should invest in retention comp."
4. **Big 4 Comp Comparison:** "Deloitte Managers earn $138K-$228K TC; PwC $132K-$211K. KPMG should be at least competitive within the Big 4 peer set."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm leading technical delivery and investing in KPMG's partner track. I need $155K base with an 18% guaranteed bonus and a $15K signing bonus. Deloitte offers higher TC for comparable roles." KPMG will counter at $135K-$145K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $185K.
