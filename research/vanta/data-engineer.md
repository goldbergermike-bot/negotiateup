### Data Engineer — Vanta Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Data engineers at Vanta build the pipelines that power Continuous Trust — with the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026, your data infrastructure decisions enable real-time regulatory compliance monitoring at enterprise scale.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | New York (USD) | Dublin (EUR €) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $155,000–$195,000 | $155,000–$195,000 | €55,000–€75,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $200,000–$260,000 | $200,000–$260,000 | €80,000–€105,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $250,000–$340,000 | $250,000–$340,000 | €105,000–€140,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, stock options (4-year vest with 1-year cliff), and performance bonus. Vanta is a private company (~$2.5B valuation), so equity is granted as Options, not RSUs.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Vanta

Data engineers at Vanta build the data infrastructure that makes Continuous Trust possible. Compliance monitoring at scale requires ingesting, processing, and analyzing massive volumes of security telemetry data from thousands of customer environments. With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026, Vanta must expand its data infrastructure to handle new AI governance data streams — model performance metrics, bias indicators, risk classifications, and regulatory evidence. Data engineers who can design these pipelines are critical to Vanta's product execution.

Vanta's Self-Certification model depends on reliable, accurate data. Every trust score, compliance assessment, and audit report is generated from data flowing through pipelines that data engineers design and maintain. If data is lost, delayed, or corrupted, customers' compliance posture may be inaccurately reported — potentially exposing them to regulatory risk. This data quality imperative elevates the data engineering role at Vanta beyond standard ETL work into mission-critical compliance infrastructure.

The compliance data that flows through Vanta's platform is highly sensitive. Data engineers must design pipelines that handle this data securely, comply with data residency requirements (especially for European customers under GDPR and the EU AI Act), and maintain complete audit trails. This compliance-aware data engineering requires specialized knowledge that few data engineers possess, creating strong negotiation leverage for candidates with this profile.

#### Vanta Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| DE3 | Data Engineer | 2–5 years |
| DE4 | Senior Data Engineer | 5–8 years |
| DE5 | Staff Data Engineer | 8–12 years |
| DE6 | Principal Data Engineer | 12+ years |

### ⚖️ Vanta EU AI Act & Continuous Trust Lever

The EU AI Act enforcement beginning in August 2026 creates new data engineering challenges for Vanta. AI governance requires new data streams — model training data lineage, performance monitoring metrics, bias detection signals, and regulatory documentation. Data engineers must build pipelines that ingest and process these new data types while maintaining the quality and reliability standards that Vanta's Self-Certification model demands.

Vanta's Self-Certification model requires data pipelines that are auditable and reproducible. Every compliance assessment generated by the platform must be traceable to source data, and every data transformation must be documented. Data engineers must implement data governance practices that satisfy both internal quality standards and the regulatory requirements of frameworks like the EU AI Act. This is compliance-grade data engineering — a specialization that commands premium compensation.

The Continuous Trust architecture requires real-time data processing. Unlike batch analytics, Continuous Trust monitoring must detect compliance drift within minutes, update trust scores continuously, and trigger alerts immediately when security controls degrade. Data engineers must design streaming data architectures that handle this real-time requirement at the scale of thousands of customer environments — a significant technical challenge.

With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026 and Vanta's Self-Certification model becoming the standard, I negotiate for Continuous Trust premiums as a regulatory risk mitigation specialist. As a data engineer, emphasize that your data infrastructure is the foundation upon which every compliance feature, trust score, and audit report is built.

#### Global Lever 1: SOC 2 & Compliance Automation

Data engineers who build SOC 2 evidence collection pipelines directly power Vanta's core product. Your pipeline reliability determines audit accuracy and customer satisfaction. Negotiate: "My data pipelines process compliance evidence for every SOC 2 audit on the platform. Pipeline reliability directly impacts audit accuracy and customer trust — I expect my compensation to reflect this core product responsibility."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Governance & EU AI Act

The EU AI Act requires new data infrastructure for AI model monitoring, training data lineage, and regulatory evidence collection. The August 2026 deadline creates urgency. State: "I build the data infrastructure for Vanta's AI governance features — new pipelines for model monitoring, bias detection, and EU AI Act evidence collection. With the August 2026 deadline, this infrastructure must be production-ready fast, and I expect my Options grant to reflect this urgency."

#### Global Lever 3: Trust Management Platform

The Continuous Trust platform's data layer determines the accuracy and timeliness of every trust score on the platform. Data engineers who design this layer create foundational platform value. Leverage: "I build the data infrastructure that powers Continuous Trust — every trust score, compliance assessment, and audit report depends on my pipelines. This foundational role justifies above-market data engineering compensation."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise GRC Expansion

Enterprise GRC customers require data isolation, custom data retention policies, and compliance with data residency regulations across multiple jurisdictions. Data engineers enabling these requirements unlock enterprise deals. Negotiate: "Enterprise GRC customers demand data isolation, multi-region data residency, and custom retention policies. My ability to architect enterprise-grade data infrastructure with these compliance requirements directly enables Vanta's highest-value contracts."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $230,000 base with 75,000 options. Accept-at floor: $200,000 total comp (base + options value + bonus). Cite the August 2026 EU AI Act enforcement deadline, Vanta's Self-Certification model, and your Continuous Trust data infrastructure expertise. For Dublin roles, open at €98,000 base.
