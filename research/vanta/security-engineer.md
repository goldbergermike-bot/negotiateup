### Security Engineer — Vanta Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Security engineers at Vanta are the domain experts who make Continuous Trust technically credible — with the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026, your security architecture expertise directly enables regulatory compliance automation for every customer.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | New York (USD) | Dublin (EUR €) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $165,000–$205,000 | $165,000–$205,000 | €60,000–€80,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $215,000–$280,000 | $215,000–$280,000 | €85,000–€112,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $270,000–$360,000 | $270,000–$360,000 | €112,000–€148,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, stock options (4-year vest with 1-year cliff), and performance bonus. Vanta is a private company (~$2.5B valuation), so equity is granted as Options, not RSUs.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Vanta

Security engineers at Vanta occupy a uniquely privileged position: you are building the security tools that define industry best practices. Unlike security engineers at most companies who are consumers of compliance frameworks, Vanta security engineers define how those frameworks are automated, monitored, and enforced. With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026, security engineers who understand both application security and regulatory compliance are in extraordinary demand.

Vanta's Self-Certification model depends on security engineers who can translate framework requirements into automated security controls. You must understand SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, and the EU AI Act at a deep technical level — not just as checkbox exercises, but as security architectures that must be implemented correctly to protect customer data and enable regulatory compliance. The Continuous Trust platform's credibility rests on the quality of security engineering behind it.

The intersection of security engineering and compliance automation is an emerging specialization with very few experienced practitioners. Security engineers who can design automated control testing, build vulnerability assessment pipelines, and implement continuous compliance monitoring are rare. This scarcity, combined with the urgency created by the August 2026 EU AI Act deadline, gives security engineers at Vanta significant negotiation leverage. Your expertise is literally the product.

#### Vanta Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| SE3 | Security Engineer | 3–5 years |
| SE4 | Senior Security Engineer | 5–8 years |
| SE5 | Staff Security Engineer | 8–12 years |
| SE6 | Principal Security Engineer | 12+ years |

### ⚖️ Vanta EU AI Act & Continuous Trust Lever

The EU AI Act enforcement beginning in August 2026 introduces security requirements for AI systems that are fundamentally different from traditional application security. Security engineers at Vanta must design monitoring systems for AI model behavior, implement bias detection controls, build adversarial robustness testing frameworks, and create security architectures that satisfy the EU AI Act's requirements for high-risk AI systems. This is a new frontier of security engineering, and Vanta is at the leading edge.

Vanta's Self-Certification model for the EU AI Act requires security engineers to define what "secure" means for AI systems — and then build the automated controls that verify it continuously. This includes designing test suites for AI model integrity, building monitoring pipelines for data poisoning detection, and implementing access controls for AI training data. The Self-Certification model's credibility depends on the rigor of these security controls.

The Continuous Trust paradigm means security monitoring never stops. Security engineers must design systems that detect compliance drift in real time — identifying when a security control has degraded, a configuration has changed, or a new vulnerability has been introduced. This always-on security monitoring at scale is technically challenging and operationally critical, justifying premium compensation.

With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026 and Vanta's Self-Certification model becoming the standard, I negotiate for Continuous Trust premiums as a regulatory risk mitigation specialist. As a security engineer, your expertise is literally Vanta's product — you are not supporting the business, you are the business. Price accordingly.

#### Global Lever 1: SOC 2 & Compliance Automation

Security engineers who define SOC 2 control automation are building the core product. Your security expertise translates directly into product capabilities. Negotiate: "I define the security controls that Vanta automates for SOC 2 — my domain expertise is Vanta's product. I expect compensation that reflects the fact that my security engineering is directly revenue-generating, not a cost center."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Governance & EU AI Act

AI security is an emerging specialization that the EU AI Act has made urgently important. Security engineers who can build AI governance security controls are exceptionally rare. State: "I bring AI security expertise that enables Vanta's EU AI Act compliance product. With the August 2026 enforcement deadline, AI security engineering is the scarcest and most valuable skill in the compliance automation market. My Options grant should reflect this strategic value."

#### Global Lever 3: Trust Management Platform

The Continuous Trust platform's security architecture must be bulletproof. Security engineers who design the platform's security posture protect both Vanta and every customer on the platform. Leverage: "I design the security architecture for the Continuous Trust platform — a system that processes sensitive compliance data for thousands of customers. Any security failure would be catastrophic for Vanta's reputation and business. This responsibility demands top-of-market security engineering compensation."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise GRC Expansion

Enterprise GRC customers have the most demanding security requirements — penetration testing, security questionnaires, and custom compliance controls. Security engineers enabling these requirements unlock premium enterprise deals. Negotiate: "Enterprise GRC customers require the highest level of security assurance. My ability to design and implement enterprise-grade security controls directly enables Vanta's most valuable contracts and justifies premium compensation in both base and Options."
