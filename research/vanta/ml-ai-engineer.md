### ML/AI Engineer — Vanta Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI engineers at Vanta build the intelligence layer of Continuous Trust — with the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026, your models automate regulatory risk classification, compliance scoring, and Self-Certification at a scale no manual process can match.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | New York (USD) | Dublin (EUR €) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $170,000–$210,000 | $170,000–$210,000 | €62,000–€82,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $220,000–$290,000 | $220,000–$290,000 | €88,000–€115,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $280,000–$370,000 | $280,000–$370,000 | €115,000–€150,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, stock options (4-year vest with 1-year cliff), and performance bonus. Vanta is a private company (~$2.5B valuation), so equity is granted as Options, not RSUs.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Vanta

ML/AI engineers at Vanta are building the systems that automate compliance at a scale that would be impossible with manual processes. Your models classify security controls, predict compliance risks, detect anomalies in customer environments, and power the intelligent automation that differentiates Vanta from competitors. With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026, ML/AI engineers who understand both machine learning and regulatory compliance are among the most sought-after technical professionals in the industry.

Vanta's Self-Certification model is increasingly powered by AI. Rather than relying solely on rule-based compliance checks, Vanta is building ML models that can assess compliance posture more accurately, identify risks proactively, and generate regulatory documentation automatically. ML/AI engineers who can build these models — ensuring they are accurate, explainable, and auditable — are central to Vanta's product differentiation and long-term competitive strategy.

The Continuous Trust paradigm requires AI systems that learn and adapt. As regulatory frameworks evolve and customer environments change, Vanta's ML models must continuously improve their accuracy without requiring manual retraining. ML/AI engineers who can design these adaptive, continuously learning systems create enormous long-term value for the platform. This architectural thinking — combined with the urgency of the August 2026 EU AI Act deadline — justifies top-of-market compensation.

#### Vanta Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| ML3 | ML/AI Engineer | 2–5 years |
| ML4 | Senior ML/AI Engineer | 5–8 years |
| ML5 | Staff ML/AI Engineer | 8–12 years |
| ML6 | Principal ML/AI Engineer | 12+ years |

### ⚖️ Vanta EU AI Act & Continuous Trust Lever

The EU AI Act enforcement beginning in August 2026 is the most significant regulatory event for ML/AI engineers in history. The Act requires AI systems to meet specific technical standards for transparency, fairness, robustness, and accountability — and Vanta must build tools that help its customers meet these requirements. ML/AI engineers at Vanta are building the very AI governance systems that the EU AI Act demands, creating a uniquely compelling professional narrative for negotiation.

Vanta's Self-Certification model for the EU AI Act requires ML models that can automatically assess AI system risk levels, monitor for bias and performance drift, and generate the technical documentation required by regulators. These models must be both highly accurate and fully explainable — a significant ML engineering challenge. ML/AI engineers who can build Self-Certification models that satisfy regulatory scrutiny are exceptionally rare and valuable.

The Continuous Trust architecture requires ML/AI systems that operate in real time. Trust scores must update as new compliance evidence is collected, anomaly detection must trigger immediately when security controls degrade, and risk classifications must adapt as customer AI deployments evolve. Building ML systems that operate at this speed and reliability level — while maintaining the accuracy and explainability that regulatory compliance demands — is a top-tier ML engineering challenge.

With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026 and Vanta's Self-Certification model becoming the standard, I negotiate for Continuous Trust premiums as a regulatory risk mitigation specialist. As an ML/AI engineer, you are building the intelligence layer that makes Vanta's compliance automation possible — your models are the product, and your compensation should reflect this.

#### Global Lever 1: SOC 2 & Compliance Automation

ML/AI engineers who build intelligent compliance automation for SOC 2 — anomaly detection, risk scoring, control classification — directly improve product quality and customer outcomes. Negotiate: "My ML models power the intelligent automation in Vanta's SOC 2 product — improving accuracy, reducing false positives, and enabling proactive risk identification. This ML-driven product differentiation directly impacts competitive positioning and customer retention."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Governance & EU AI Act

ML/AI engineers building EU AI Act compliance tools are in the extraordinary position of building AI that governs AI. This meta-level challenge is technically fascinating and commercially critical. State: "I build the AI systems that help Vanta's customers comply with the EU AI Act — AI that governs AI. With the August 2026 enforcement deadline, this capability is urgently needed and uniquely differentiating. My Options grant should reflect the strategic value of building Vanta's AI governance intelligence layer."

#### Global Lever 3: Trust Management Platform

The Continuous Trust platform's intelligence layer determines the accuracy and value of every trust score, risk assessment, and compliance recommendation. ML/AI engineers designing this layer create core platform value. Leverage: "I design the ML models that power Continuous Trust — the intelligence layer that differentiates Vanta from rule-based competitors. My models determine the accuracy of every trust score on the platform, and my compensation should reflect this foundational impact."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise GRC Expansion

Enterprise GRC customers demand advanced analytics — predictive compliance modeling, custom risk scoring, and AI-powered remediation recommendations. ML/AI engineers enabling these features unlock premium enterprise deals. Negotiate: "Enterprise GRC customers need ML-powered compliance intelligence — predictive risk models, custom scoring, and AI-driven recommendations. My ability to build these advanced capabilities directly enables Vanta's highest-value enterprise contracts."
