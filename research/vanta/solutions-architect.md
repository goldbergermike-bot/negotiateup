#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Vanta

Solutions architects at Vanta are the technical experts who design compliance architectures for enterprise customers. You must understand every regulatory framework Vanta supports — SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, and the EU AI Act — and design implementation plans that map customer infrastructure to compliance requirements. With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026, enterprise customers are urgently seeking solutions architects who can design comprehensive compliance programs that include AI governance.

The Self-Certification model that Vanta promotes requires solutions architects who can demonstrate how automated compliance evidence collection replaces manual audit processes. You must build customer confidence in Self-Certification by designing reference architectures, conducting proof-of-concept deployments, and addressing technical objections. The Continuous Trust paradigm depends on SAs who can translate the platform's capabilities into customer-specific compliance solutions.

Solutions architects at Vanta operate at the intersection of sales and engineering. Your technical credibility directly impacts deal closure rates and contract sizes. Enterprise customers making six- and seven-figure platform commitments need an SA who can architect their entire compliance program. This revenue-generating role — combining deep regulatory knowledge with technical design expertise — commands premium compensation, especially as the August 2026 EU AI Act deadline creates urgency.

#### Vanta Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| SA1 | Solutions Architect | 5–8 years |
| SA2 | Senior Solutions Architect | 8–12 years |
| SA3 | Principal Solutions Architect | 12+ years |
| SA4 | Distinguished Solutions Architect | 15+ years |

### ⚖️ Vanta EU AI Act & Continuous Trust Lever

The EU AI Act enforcement beginning in August 2026 creates a massive opportunity for solutions architects. Enterprise customers deploying AI systems need guidance on risk classification, compliance architecture, and monitoring design. Solutions architects who can design end-to-end EU AI Act compliance programs using Vanta's platform become indispensable to both the sales process and the customer relationship.

Vanta's Self-Certification model requires SAs to design compliance architectures that generate audit-ready evidence automatically. For the EU AI Act, this means mapping AI system inventories to risk categories, designing continuous monitoring configurations, and creating Self-Certification workflows that satisfy regulatory requirements. SAs who can design these architectures for complex enterprise environments command significant premiums.

The Continuous Trust paradigm means SAs must design for ongoing compliance, not one-time implementations. Your architecture must account for evolving regulatory requirements, changing customer infrastructure, and expanding AI deployments. This requires a fundamentally different approach to solutions architecture — one that emphasizes adaptability, automation, and continuous value delivery.

With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026 and Vanta's Self-Certification model becoming the standard, I negotiate for Continuous Trust premiums as a regulatory risk mitigation specialist. As a solutions architect, emphasize that your technical leadership directly converts into closed enterprise deals and expanded customer relationships.

#### Global Lever 1: SOC 2 & Compliance Automation

SAs who design SOC 2 compliance architectures for enterprise customers directly enable deal closure and platform adoption. Negotiate: "My SOC 2 compliance architecture designs are directly tied to enterprise deal closure. Every proof-of-concept I deliver converts into a six-figure contract. I expect my compensation — including Options — to reflect this direct revenue impact."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Governance & EU AI Act

The EU AI Act creates a new category of SA engagement. Enterprise customers need architects who can design comprehensive AI governance programs before the August 2026 deadline. State: "I design EU AI Act compliance architectures for enterprise customers — a capability that does not exist at most competitors. With the August 2026 enforcement deadline creating urgency, my AI governance architecture expertise directly accelerates Vanta's enterprise pipeline."

#### Global Lever 3: Trust Management Platform

SAs design how enterprise customers implement and use the Continuous Trust platform. Your architecture decisions determine platform stickiness and expansion potential. Leverage: "My Continuous Trust architecture designs determine how deeply Vanta integrates into enterprise customer infrastructure. Deeper integrations mean higher retention and expansion — I design for platform stickiness at enterprise scale."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise GRC Expansion

Enterprise GRC is the fastest-growing segment of Vanta's business, and SAs are on the front lines of this expansion. Your technical credibility enables large, multi-year platform commitments. Negotiate: "Enterprise GRC expansion depends on solutions architects who can design comprehensive compliance programs spanning multiple frameworks. My multi-framework architecture expertise directly enables Vanta's largest and most strategic deals."
