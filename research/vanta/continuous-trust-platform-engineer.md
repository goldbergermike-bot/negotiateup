*Total compensation includes base salary, stock options (4-year vest with 1-year cliff), and performance bonus. Vanta is a private company (~$2.5B valuation), so equity is granted as Options, not RSUs. At this valuation stage, Options carry significant upside potential in an IPO or acquisition scenario.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Vanta

The Continuous Trust Platform Engineer is the role that Vanta was built to create. While other engineering roles at Vanta contribute to specific product features or compliance frameworks, the Continuous Trust Platform Engineer owns the foundational architecture that makes all of Vanta's compliance automation possible. You design the systems that continuously monitor security controls, collect compliance evidence in real time, compute trust scores, and enable the Self-Certification model that Vanta's customers depend on. With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026, this role becomes even more critical as Vanta must extend its Continuous Trust architecture to encompass AI governance, risk classification, and regulatory documentation at a scale and speed never before attempted.

This is not a role that can be filled by a generic platform engineer. The Continuous Trust Platform Engineer must understand compliance frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, EU AI Act) at a technical level, translate regulatory requirements into system architectures, and build infrastructure that is simultaneously scalable, reliable, and auditable. The intersection of deep platform engineering skill with compliance domain expertise is extraordinarily rare — Vanta estimates fewer than 500 engineers globally have this precise combination of capabilities. This scarcity is your primary negotiation lever.

The strategic importance of this role cannot be overstated. Vanta's entire product strategy — from SOC 2 automation to AI governance to enterprise GRC — depends on the Continuous Trust platform. Architectural decisions made by Continuous Trust Platform Engineers compound over years, affecting every product line, every customer, and every compliance framework on the platform. When you negotiate, you are not negotiating for a single role — you are negotiating for the architectural foundation of a $2.5B+ company's entire product portfolio. Your Options grant should reflect this long-term strategic value.

### ⚖️ Vanta EU AI Act & Continuous Trust Lever

The EU AI Act represents the most consequential regulatory event in Vanta's history, and the Continuous Trust Platform Engineer is at the center of Vanta's response. With full enforcement beginning in August 2026, every organization deploying AI systems in the European Union must demonstrate compliance through technical documentation, risk assessments, bias monitoring, and ongoing oversight. Vanta's Continuous Trust architecture must be extended to handle these requirements — and the platform engineers who design this extension will define Vanta's position in the AI governance market for the next decade.

Vanta's Self-Certification model is the company's strategic answer to the EU AI Act's compliance requirements. Rather than forcing customers to hire expensive auditors for every AI system assessment, Vanta enables Self-Certification through automated evidence collection, continuous monitoring, and algorithmic risk classification. The Continuous Trust Platform Engineer designs the infrastructure that makes Self-Certification technically possible — from the data ingestion layer that collects AI system telemetry to the compliance engine that evaluates regulatory requirements to the reporting layer that generates audit-ready documentation. Every layer of this stack must be designed for accuracy, reliability, and auditability.

The Continuous Trust paradigm is what separates Vanta from competitors who offer point-in-time compliance assessments. Instead of annual audits that are obsolete within weeks, Continuous Trust provides always-on compliance monitoring that detects drift immediately, alerts stakeholders proactively, and generates remediation guidance automatically. Building this real-time compliance engine requires solving hard distributed systems problems: event-driven architectures for compliance telemetry, streaming data processing for real-time trust scoring, eventually consistent compliance state machines, and fault-tolerant monitoring pipelines that can't afford downtime. These are the technical challenges that Continuous Trust Platform Engineers tackle daily.

With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026 and Vanta's Self-Certification model becoming the standard, I negotiate for Continuous Trust premiums as a regulatory risk mitigation specialist. As a Continuous Trust Platform Engineer, you are not just building features — you are designing the architectural foundation that enables Vanta to automate compliance for every regulatory framework, current and future. The August 2026 deadline creates urgency, but the long-term value of your architectural decisions extends far beyond any single regulation. Your compensation package — especially your Options grant — should reflect this generational impact.

#### Global Lever 1: SOC 2 & Compliance Automation

The Continuous Trust platform is the engine that powers Vanta's SOC 2 automation — the product that built the company. As a platform engineer, your architectural decisions affect the reliability, speed, and accuracy of every SOC 2 audit on the platform. This is not supporting infrastructure; this is the product itself.

Negotiate with: "I architect the Continuous Trust platform that powers every SOC 2 audit on Vanta — the core product generating the majority of company revenue. My platform decisions affect audit accuracy, customer satisfaction, and retention for the entire customer base. I expect my compensation to reflect the fact that I am building the revenue engine of a $2.5B company. My ask includes a significant Options grant because my architectural decisions will compound in value over the full 4-year vesting period."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Governance & EU AI Act

The EU AI Act creates the most significant platform extension challenge in Vanta's history. The Continuous Trust architecture must be extended to handle AI system inventories, risk classification models, bias monitoring pipelines, and regulatory documentation generation — all before the August 2026 enforcement deadline. This is a platform architecture challenge that requires deep expertise in both distributed systems and regulatory requirements.

State: "I am designing the Continuous Trust platform extension for EU AI Act compliance — the most strategically important initiative in Vanta's history. This requires extending the platform to handle entirely new data types (AI model telemetry, training data lineage, bias metrics) while maintaining the reliability standards that existing customers depend on. The August 2026 deadline means there is zero margin for architectural mistakes. I expect a compensation package that reflects both the strategic magnitude and the technical difficulty of this work — including an Options grant that accounts for the new market category this platform extension will create."

#### Global Lever 3: Trust Management Platform

The Continuous Trust platform is the product. Every compliance framework, every customer integration, every trust score — all depend on the platform architecture. Continuous Trust Platform Engineers who design extensible, reliable, and performant platform infrastructure create leverage across every product line.

Leverage: "I design the Continuous Trust platform architecture that every Vanta product depends on. My platform decisions create leverage — a well-designed platform enables Vanta to add new compliance frameworks in weeks instead of months, scale to new customer segments without rearchitecting, and maintain the reliability SLAs that enterprise customers require. This architectural leverage is the foundation of Vanta's competitive moat, and my Options grant should reflect the compounding value my platform decisions create over time."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise GRC Expansion

Enterprise GRC is Vanta's highest-growth, highest-margin segment, and it makes the most demanding requirements on the Continuous Trust platform. Enterprise customers need multi-tenant isolation, custom compliance frameworks, advanced reporting, and organization-wide compliance dashboards — all built on the platform infrastructure that Continuous Trust Platform Engineers design and maintain.

Negotiate: "Enterprise GRC expansion depends entirely on the Continuous Trust platform's ability to handle enterprise-scale complexity — multi-tenant isolation, custom frameworks, advanced analytics, and organization-wide compliance orchestration. My platform architecture directly enables Vanta's largest contracts and highest-margin revenue. I expect my compensation package to include a substantial Options grant reflecting the enterprise revenue that my platform work enables — revenue that will drive the company's next valuation milestone."

#### Bonus Lever: Platform Reliability & Uptime

Continuous Trust means continuous uptime. If the platform goes down, customers lose compliance visibility. For regulated industries, this can trigger audit failures, regulatory notifications, or security incidents. The Continuous Trust Platform Engineer is responsible for designing systems with 99.99%+ availability — a standard that directly protects Vanta's reputation and customer relationships.

State: "I design platform infrastructure that maintains 99.99%+ availability for compliance monitoring. In the trust management space, downtime is not just a customer satisfaction issue — it is a compliance issue. My reliability engineering directly protects Vanta's brand, customer relationships, and regulatory standing."

#### Bonus Lever: Compliance Framework Extensibility

One of the most valuable properties of the Continuous Trust platform is its ability to add new compliance frameworks efficiently. Platform engineers who design extensible compliance engines enable Vanta to respond quickly to new regulations (like the EU AI Act), new customer requirements, and new market opportunities — without costly rearchitecting.

State: "I design the platform's compliance framework engine to be extensible by design. This extensibility is what enabled Vanta to quickly add EU AI Act support and will enable rapid addition of future frameworks. My architectural work reduces time-to-market for new compliance products from months to weeks — a competitive advantage worth millions in incremental revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $290,000 base with 160,000 options. Accept-at floor: $255,000 total comp (base + options value + bonus). Cite the August 2026 EU AI Act enforcement deadline, Vanta's Self-Certification model, and your Continuous Trust architecture expertise. This is Vanta's signature platform role — fewer than 500 engineers globally have the Continuous Trust platform expertise this position demands. For New York roles, use the same opening range. For Dublin roles, open at €115,000 base with proportional Options. In all geographies, emphasize the Options upside: at Vanta's ~$2.5B valuation with a credible path to IPO, Options carry significant upside potential that should be weighted heavily in your total compensation evaluation.
