#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Vanta

Product designers at Vanta solve one of the hardest design challenges in enterprise software: making complex regulatory compliance intuitive. The EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026 means Vanta must ship AI governance features that non-technical compliance teams can use effectively. Designers who can simplify regulatory complexity — turning EU AI Act risk classification into clear user workflows — are critical to product adoption and directly impact revenue.

Vanta's Self-Certification model depends on great design. If customers cannot navigate Self-Certification workflows easily, they will abandon the platform for manual audit processes or competitors. Product designers must create experiences that guide users through compliance assessments, present real-time trust scores clearly, and surface remediation steps intuitively. The Continuous Trust paradigm requires designing for ongoing engagement, not one-time interactions.

Compliance software has historically suffered from poor UX — dense tables, confusing jargon, and opaque processes. Vanta's competitive advantage is making compliance beautiful and understandable. Designers who can maintain this UX quality while adding complex new features for the EU AI Act and other regulatory frameworks are rare and valuable. Your portfolio demonstrating the ability to simplify compliance experiences is a powerful negotiation asset.

#### Vanta Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| D3 | Product Designer | 2–5 years |
| D4 | Senior Product Designer | 5–8 years |
| D5 | Staff Product Designer | 8–12 years |

### ⚖️ Vanta EU AI Act & Continuous Trust Lever

The EU AI Act enforcement beginning in August 2026 creates massive design challenges for Vanta. AI risk classification, continuous monitoring dashboards, and Self-Certification workflows must be designed in a way that is both regulatory-compliant and user-friendly. Product designers who can bridge this gap between regulatory rigor and intuitive UX are at the core of Vanta's product strategy.

Designing for Self-Certification requires understanding both the regulatory framework and the user's mental model. Customers going through EU AI Act Self-Certification need to understand what data is being collected, why it matters, and what actions they need to take. Designers must create information architectures that make regulatory concepts accessible without oversimplifying them — a delicate balance that requires deep domain expertise.

The Continuous Trust model requires designing for real-time data. Compliance dashboards must show current trust scores, alert on compliance drift, and provide actionable remediation guidance. Unlike static reporting, Continuous Trust design requires understanding real-time data visualization, notification systems, and progressive disclosure — all while maintaining Vanta's clean, accessible design language.

With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026 and Vanta's Self-Certification model becoming the standard, I negotiate for Continuous Trust premiums as a regulatory risk mitigation specialist. As a designer, emphasize that your design decisions directly impact product adoption and customer retention — the metrics that drive Vanta's revenue growth.

#### Global Lever 1: SOC 2 & Compliance Automation

Designers who own SOC 2 compliance experiences shape the core product that drives Vanta's revenue. Your design decisions affect time-to-compliance, user satisfaction, and retention. Negotiate: "My design of SOC 2 compliance workflows directly impacts time-to-audit and customer satisfaction. Vanta's design quality is a key differentiator, and I expect compensation that reflects the revenue impact of great compliance UX."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Governance & EU AI Act

Designing AI governance features for the EU AI Act is a greenfield opportunity. You are creating a new product experience category with the hard August 2026 deadline. State: "I am designing Vanta's AI governance experience from scratch — making EU AI Act risk classification and compliance intuitive for non-technical users. This design work directly enables product adoption in a new market category."

#### Global Lever 3: Trust Management Platform

The Continuous Trust dashboard is the primary interface through which customers interact with Vanta. Designers who improve this experience increase engagement and retention. Leverage: "I design the Continuous Trust experience that every Vanta customer uses daily. Dashboard engagement directly correlates with retention, and my design expertise drives this core business metric."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise GRC Expansion

Enterprise GRC customers have complex needs that require sophisticated design solutions — custom dashboards, advanced reporting, and multi-stakeholder workflows. State: "Enterprise GRC design requires solving for organizational complexity — multiple compliance frameworks, role-based access, and executive reporting. My enterprise design expertise enables Vanta's highest-value customer segment."
