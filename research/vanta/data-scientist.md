### Data Scientist — Vanta Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Data scientists at Vanta power Continuous Trust analytics — with the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026, your models drive risk classification, compliance scoring, and Self-Certification intelligence at regulatory scale.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | New York (USD) | Dublin (EUR €) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $160,000–$200,000 | $160,000–$200,000 | €58,000–€78,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $210,000–$270,000 | $210,000–$270,000 | €82,000–€108,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $260,000–$350,000 | $260,000–$350,000 | €108,000–€142,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, stock options (4-year vest with 1-year cliff), and performance bonus. Vanta is a private company (~$2.5B valuation), so equity is granted as Options, not RSUs.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Vanta

Data scientists at Vanta build the analytical foundation of the Continuous Trust platform. Your models determine trust scores, predict compliance drift, classify AI system risk levels, and generate insights that help customers maintain regulatory compliance. With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026, the demand for data scientists who can build regulatory-grade analytical systems has surged, creating significant negotiation leverage.

Vanta's Self-Certification model relies on data-driven compliance assessment. Rather than subjective auditor judgment, Vanta uses algorithmic approaches to evaluate security controls, measure compliance posture, and generate evidence. Data scientists who can design these assessment systems — ensuring they are accurate, fair, and auditable — are central to Vanta's value proposition. This requires expertise in both machine learning and regulatory compliance, a rare and valuable combination.

The Continuous Trust paradigm generates massive amounts of compliance telemetry data. Data scientists must build systems that process this data in real time, identify anomalies, and surface actionable insights. The scale and sensitivity of this data — touching every customer's security infrastructure — demands rigorous statistical methods and careful model governance. Your expertise in handling compliance-sensitive data at scale directly justifies premium compensation.

#### Vanta Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| DS3 | Data Scientist | 2–5 years |
| DS4 | Senior Data Scientist | 5–8 years |
| DS5 | Staff Data Scientist | 8–12 years |
| DS6 | Principal Data Scientist | 12+ years |

### ⚖️ Vanta EU AI Act & Continuous Trust Lever

The EU AI Act enforcement beginning in August 2026 creates specific requirements for AI system risk classification and monitoring that are deeply technical and data-intensive. Data scientists at Vanta must build the classification models that determine which AI systems fall under which risk category, design monitoring systems that detect compliance drift, and create the analytical foundation for Self-Certification workflows. This is not standard data science — it is regulatory data science at enterprise scale.

Vanta's Self-Certification model depends on rigorous, auditable analytics. Unlike consumer-facing recommendation systems, compliance scoring models must be explainable, reproducible, and defensible under regulatory scrutiny. Data scientists must design models that satisfy both the technical requirements of accurate risk assessment and the regulatory requirements of the EU AI Act. This dual constraint makes the role uniquely challenging and valuable.

The Continuous Trust model requires real-time analytics infrastructure. Trust scores must update continuously as new compliance evidence is collected, security controls change, and regulatory requirements evolve. Data scientists must build streaming analytics pipelines that handle this complexity while maintaining accuracy. The technical challenge of real-time compliance analytics at Vanta's scale is significant and justifies above-market compensation.

With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026 and Vanta's Self-Certification model becoming the standard, I negotiate for Continuous Trust premiums as a regulatory risk mitigation specialist. As a data scientist, emphasize that your analytical models are the intelligence layer that makes Vanta's compliance automation possible — and price your expertise accordingly.

#### Global Lever 1: SOC 2 & Compliance Automation

Data scientists who build compliance scoring and anomaly detection models for SOC 2 automation improve audit accuracy and reduce false positives. Negotiate: "My compliance scoring models directly improve Vanta's SOC 2 automation accuracy, reducing false positives by X% and improving customer satisfaction. I expect compensation that reflects the revenue impact of more accurate compliance analytics."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Governance & EU AI Act

The EU AI Act requires AI risk classification models — a core data science challenge. Data scientists building these systems are creating Vanta's AI governance intelligence layer. State: "I build the AI risk classification and monitoring models that enable Vanta's EU AI Act compliance features. With the August 2026 enforcement deadline, these models are critical to Vanta's product strategy, and my compensation should reflect this strategic importance."

#### Global Lever 3: Trust Management Platform

Trust scores are the core metric of Vanta's Continuous Trust platform. Data scientists who design trust scoring algorithms directly impact the platform's value proposition. Leverage: "I design the trust scoring algorithms that power Vanta's Continuous Trust platform. These scores are the primary metric customers use to assess their compliance posture — my analytical work directly defines the platform's core value."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise GRC Expansion

Enterprise GRC customers need advanced analytics — custom compliance dashboards, risk heat maps, and predictive compliance modeling. Data scientists enabling these capabilities unlock Vanta's highest-value customer segment. Negotiate: "Enterprise GRC customers demand advanced compliance analytics that go beyond standard dashboards. My expertise in building custom analytical models enables Vanta's enterprise expansion and justifies a premium in both base and Options."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $240,000 base with 85,000 options. Accept-at floor: $215,000 total comp (base + options value + bonus). Cite the August 2026 EU AI Act enforcement deadline, Vanta's Self-Certification model, and your Continuous Trust analytics expertise. For Dublin roles, open at €100,000 base.
