#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Vanta

Technical program managers at Vanta manage the most complex cross-functional programs in the compliance automation space. You coordinate between engineering, product, security, compliance, and customer success teams to deliver platform features that must meet both technical quality standards and regulatory requirements. The EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026 is a hard constraint that makes program management at Vanta higher-stakes than at typical SaaS companies.

Vanta's Continuous Trust platform spans multiple compliance frameworks, each with its own requirements, timelines, and stakeholders. TPMs must manage the interdependencies between these frameworks while maintaining program velocity. The Self-Certification model adds complexity — TPMs must ensure that every feature shipped through the Self-Certification pipeline meets regulatory standards, not just product requirements. This regulatory accountability elevates the TPM role beyond standard program management.

The August 2026 EU AI Act enforcement deadline creates a program management challenge of exceptional complexity. TPMs must coordinate AI governance feature development across multiple engineering teams while managing dependencies on external regulatory guidance, customer feedback, and security review processes. Your ability to navigate this complexity — keeping programs on track despite regulatory uncertainty — is a critical enabler of Vanta's strategic execution.

#### Vanta Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| TPM1 | Technical Program Manager | 4–7 years |
| TPM2 | Senior Technical Program Manager | 7–10 years |
| TPM3 | Staff Technical Program Manager | 10–14 years |
| TPM4 | Director of Program Management | 14+ years |

### ⚖️ Vanta EU AI Act & Continuous Trust Lever

The EU AI Act enforcement beginning in August 2026 is the defining program management challenge at Vanta. TPMs must create and execute program plans that deliver AI governance features on time while coordinating across engineering, compliance, legal, and product teams. The stakes are existential — Vanta's customers are counting on the platform to enable their own EU AI Act compliance before enforcement begins.

Vanta's Self-Certification model requires TPMs to manage programs that have both technical and regulatory milestones. A feature is not "shipped" when it passes engineering review — it must also pass compliance review to ensure it meets the Self-Certification standards that Vanta promises customers. TPMs must design program processes that incorporate regulatory checkpoints without slowing delivery velocity.

The Continuous Trust paradigm means programs are never truly "done." TPMs must plan for ongoing monitoring, iterative improvement, and regulatory updates. This requires a program management philosophy that embraces continuous delivery over big-bang releases — especially important as regulatory requirements evolve and new compliance frameworks are added to the platform.

With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026 and Vanta's Self-Certification model becoming the standard, I negotiate for Continuous Trust premiums as a regulatory risk mitigation specialist. As a TPM, emphasize that your program leadership is the glue that holds Vanta's most critical initiatives together — and that the August 2026 deadline makes your execution capability even more valuable.

#### Global Lever 1: SOC 2 & Compliance Automation

TPMs managing SOC 2 automation programs coordinate the delivery of Vanta's core revenue-generating product. Negotiate: "I manage the program delivery of SOC 2 automation features — Vanta's core product. My program leadership ensures on-time delivery of features that directly drive customer acquisition and retention. I expect compensation that reflects this P&L adjacency."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Governance & EU AI Act

The EU AI Act program is Vanta's highest-priority initiative with a hard August 2026 deadline. TPMs leading this program have exceptional leverage. State: "I lead the EU AI Act program — Vanta's most strategically important initiative with a hard August 2026 regulatory deadline. This program spans multiple engineering teams, requires coordination with legal and compliance, and has zero room for slippage. My compensation should reflect this program's strategic magnitude."

#### Global Lever 3: Trust Management Platform

TPMs managing Continuous Trust platform programs coordinate foundational infrastructure work that affects every product line. Leverage: "My Continuous Trust platform program management ensures foundational infrastructure is delivered on time and meets both engineering and regulatory standards. Platform programs create leverage across every Vanta product, and I expect my compensation to reflect this scope."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise GRC Expansion

Enterprise GRC programs require managing complex customer requirements, custom feature development, and cross-functional coordination with sales and customer success. Negotiate: "Enterprise GRC programs are Vanta's most complex programs — requiring coordination across engineering, sales, compliance, and customer success. My program leadership directly enables the company's highest-value customer segment."
