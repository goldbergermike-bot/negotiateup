### Engineering Manager — Vanta Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering managers at Vanta lead teams building Continuous Trust infrastructure — with the EU AI Act enforcement in August 2026, you are responsible for shipping regulatory compliance automation on a hard deadline.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | New York (USD) | Dublin (EUR €) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $175,000–$215,000 | $175,000–$215,000 | €70,000–€90,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $220,000–$280,000 | $220,000–$280,000 | €90,000–€115,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $270,000–$360,000 | $270,000–$360,000 | €115,000–€150,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, stock options (4-year vest with 1-year cliff), and performance bonus. Vanta is a private company (~$2.5B valuation), so equity is granted as Options, not RSUs.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Vanta

Engineering managers at Vanta carry dual responsibility: they must build and retain high-performing teams while ensuring those teams deliver compliance automation products that meet hard regulatory deadlines. The EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026 is not a soft target — it is a legal requirement that Vanta's customers depend on the platform to meet. EMs who can navigate this pressure while maintaining team health and code quality are exceptionally valuable.

Vanta's Continuous Trust platform requires engineering teams that deeply understand compliance frameworks. As an EM, you are not just managing engineers — you are building teams with the rare combination of security expertise, systems engineering skill, and regulatory knowledge needed to ship Self-Certification products. Recruiting and retaining this talent in a competitive market is a strategic challenge that justifies premium EM compensation.

The compliance automation space is growing rapidly, and Vanta needs EMs who can scale teams while maintaining the velocity needed to capture market share ahead of the August 2026 EU AI Act deadline. Your ability to hire, develop, and retain top compliance engineering talent directly impacts Vanta's ability to execute. Negotiate on this basis — your management leverage creates compounding organizational value.

#### Vanta Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| M1 | Engineering Manager | 6–10 years |
| M2 | Senior Engineering Manager | 10–14 years |
| M3 | Director of Engineering | 14+ years |
| M4 | VP of Engineering | 16+ years |

### ⚖️ Vanta EU AI Act & Continuous Trust Lever

The EU AI Act enforcement beginning in August 2026 creates a hard deadline that reverberates through Vanta's entire product organization. As an engineering manager, you are responsible for ensuring your team ships AI governance and compliance features on time. The stakes are high — Vanta's customers are counting on the platform to help them achieve regulatory compliance before enforcement begins. This deadline pressure, combined with the complexity of the Self-Certification model, makes EM roles at Vanta more demanding than typical SaaS EM positions.

Managing Continuous Trust systems requires understanding both the technical architecture and the regulatory landscape. You must make prioritization decisions that balance product velocity with compliance accuracy. A wrong architectural call or a missed regulatory requirement could expose Vanta's customers to enforcement risk after August 2026. This regulatory accountability should be reflected in your compensation package.

Engineering managers at Vanta also play a critical role in building the Self-Certification model. You must hire engineers who understand compliance, establish code review processes that catch regulatory gaps, and create team cultures that prioritize both speed and accuracy. This management complexity — part technical leader, part regulatory program manager — is unique to the compliance automation space and justifies above-market compensation.

With the EU AI Act enforcement deadline in August 2026 and Vanta's Self-Certification model becoming the standard, I negotiate for Continuous Trust premiums as a regulatory risk mitigation specialist. As an EM, emphasize that you are building and leading the teams that will determine whether Vanta meets the most important regulatory deadline in its history.

#### Global Lever 1: SOC 2 & Compliance Automation

Engineering managers leading SOC 2 automation teams directly impact Vanta's core revenue. Your team's output determines audit times, customer satisfaction, and retention. Negotiate: "I lead the team responsible for SOC 2 automation — the core product driving Vanta's revenue. My ability to recruit, retain, and develop compliance engineers directly impacts the platform's reliability and customer retention metrics."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Governance & EU AI Act

EMs building AI governance teams are creating a new product line under extreme time pressure. The August 2026 EU AI Act deadline means there is no room for mishire or velocity loss. State: "Building an AI governance engineering team from scratch with a hard August 2026 deadline requires exceptional management skill. I need to hire, onboard, and ramp engineers fast while maintaining quality — and I expect my compensation to reflect this high-pressure mandate."

#### Global Lever 3: Trust Management Platform

The Continuous Trust platform requires cross-functional coordination between engineering, security, compliance, and product teams. EMs who can facilitate this coordination while maintaining team velocity create outsized organizational value. Leverage: "Leading a Continuous Trust platform team requires managing complexity across engineering, compliance, and security domains. My cross-functional leadership directly enables Vanta's platform strategy."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise GRC Expansion

Enterprise GRC customers require dedicated engineering support, custom features, and rapid iteration. EMs managing enterprise-focused teams directly impact Vanta's highest-value deals. Negotiate: "Enterprise GRC expansion requires engineering teams that can build custom compliance features fast. My leadership of enterprise engineering teams directly enables Vanta's largest contracts and highest-margin revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $265,000 base with 100,000 options. Accept-at floor: $235,000 total comp (base + options value + bonus). Cite the August 2026 EU AI Act enforcement deadline, Vanta's Self-Certification model, and your Continuous Trust team-building expertise. For Dublin roles, open at €110,000 base.
