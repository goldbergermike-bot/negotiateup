#### Negotiation DNA

The DevOps Engineer at Fidelity Digital Assets owns the infrastructure, deployment, and reliability of institutional-grade digital asset systems, including the FIDD stablecoin platform, digital asset custody infrastructure, and institutional trading systems. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent), expects DevOps Engineers to build and maintain the CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, monitoring systems, and incident response frameworks that keep mission-critical financial systems running with zero downtime. This role operates at the intersection of traditional enterprise infrastructure standards (SOC 2, PCI-DSS, regulatory audit trails) and blockchain-native infrastructure patterns (node management, validator operations, multi-chain deployments). Candidates are expected to bring 4-8 years of DevOps/SRE experience, ideally in financial services, payments, or blockchain infrastructure where uptime is measured in financial impact. Compensation includes Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs vesting over four years, tied to the parent company's enterprise value. DevOps Engineers are the reliability architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, building the infrastructure foundation that ensures FIDD operates with the availability and auditability that institutional clients demand.

#### Level Mapping

| Fidelity Digital Assets | Coinbase | Galaxy Digital | BitGo | Circle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DevOps Engineer (DA-DO1) | Infrastructure Engineer (L4) | DevOps Engineer | DevOps Engineer | Site Reliability Engineer |
| Senior DevOps Engineer (DA-DO2) | Senior Infrastructure Engineer (L5) | Senior DevOps | Senior DevOps Engineer | Senior SRE |

Fidelity DA-DO1 maps to Coinbase Infrastructure Engineer L4 and Circle SRE. DA-DO2 aligns with Coinbase Senior Infrastructure Engineer L5 and is the primary level for candidates owning the infrastructure for a full product vertical (e.g., FIDD platform infrastructure, custody node operations, or the observability stack).

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD is Fidelity's flagship digital asset product, designed for institutional settlement, cross-border treasury operations, and on-chain capital markets infrastructure.

As a DevOps Engineer on the FIDD platform, you own the infrastructure reliability layer:

- **Blockchain Node Infrastructure:** Managing and scaling the blockchain node infrastructure that powers FIDD across multiple chains (Ethereum, Solana, Fidelity's proprietary settlement layer). Node uptime directly impacts FIDD's ability to process mints, burns, and transfers.
- **CI/CD for Financial Infrastructure:** Building deployment pipelines that meet institutional compliance requirements — immutable audit trails, multi-party approval gates, automated compliance checks, and zero-downtime deployment strategies for financial-critical systems.
- **Observability & Incident Response:** Designing the monitoring, alerting, and incident response frameworks for the FIDD platform. In stablecoin operations, an infrastructure incident is a financial incident — response time is measured in dollars, not just SLA minutes.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Defining and maintaining the entire FIDD infrastructure as code (Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm) with strict version control and change management processes required by financial regulators.
- **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity:** Architecting multi-region disaster recovery and business continuity plans for the FIDD platform, ensuring that institutional clients experience zero interruption even during infrastructure failures.

Key negotiation framing:

- **"I'm building the infrastructure that keeps billions of dollars in stablecoin transactions running with institutional-grade reliability."** This positions the DevOps role as a direct guardian of financial integrity, not just a technical operations function.
- **Regulatory infrastructure expertise:** DevOps engineers who understand SOC 2, PCI-DSS, and financial regulatory audit requirements while also managing blockchain node infrastructure are exceptionally rare. This dual competency justifies premium compensation.
- **Uptime equals trust:** In the stablecoin space, infrastructure reliability is directly correlated with institutional trust. A single outage can cost millions and undermine institutional confidence in FIDD.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The Financial Infrastructure Premium:**
   > "The FIDD DevOps role requires managing infrastructure where downtime is measured in financial impact, not just SLA minutes. My background in [financial services infrastructure / high-availability systems / blockchain node operations] at [Previous Company] directly maps to the FIDD platform's core reliability requirements. Coinbase Senior Infrastructure Engineer compensation ranges from $260K-$350K TC. Given the financial-critical nature of FIDD infrastructure, I'd expect compensation in the $260K-$310K range."

2. **Lever 2 — The Compliance Infrastructure Argument:**
   > "Building infrastructure for a regulated stablecoin issuer requires a specialized skill set — SOC 2 compliance, immutable audit trails, regulatory change management, and multi-party deployment approvals layered on top of blockchain node management. My experience building compliant infrastructure at [Previous Financial Institution] is directly transferable to FIDD. I'd like the comp to reflect this regulatory infrastructure expertise."

3. **Lever 3 — The RSU Growth Thesis:**
   > "Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs are compelling because the infrastructure reliability I maintain directly enables FIDD's institutional adoption — clients won't use a stablecoin platform they can't trust to be always-on. I'd like to explore a larger initial RSU grant — in the $250K-$272K range over 4 years — to align my compensation with the platform reliability I'll be delivering."

4. **Lever 4 — The Competing Offer Anchor:**
   > "I have a competing offer from [Coinbase / AWS / Cloudflare] at $[X] total comp for a comparable infrastructure/DevOps role. I'm prioritizing Fidelity because of the FIDD mission and the opportunity to build institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure, but I need the total package to be within 10-15% of my best offer. A signing bonus of $35K-$55K would close the Year 1 gap."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $212K base and $252K RSUs ($63K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $168K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for infrastructure and DevOps engineers at crypto and financial services firms in Boston, my competing offer from Coinbase ($305K TC) for a Senior Infrastructure Engineer role, and the mission-critical nature of maintaining FIDD's institutional-grade infrastructure, I'd like to target $208K base, $245K RSUs, a 22% bonus target, and a $45K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $315K. I'm prepared to accept at $192K+ base and $215K+ RSUs as a floor."
