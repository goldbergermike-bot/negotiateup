#### Negotiation DNA

The Engineering Manager at Fidelity Digital Assets leads teams of 6-12 engineers building the infrastructure for institutional-grade digital asset products, including the FIDD stablecoin platform, custody systems, and trading infrastructure. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent), expects Engineering Managers to combine deep technical credibility with strong people leadership — hiring top blockchain talent, setting technical direction, and delivering complex projects on aggressive timelines. The EM role at Fidelity DA is unique because it requires fluency in both traditional financial services engineering culture (regulatory compliance, audit trails, change management) and crypto-native engineering culture (rapid iteration, open-source collaboration, protocol-level thinking). Compensation reflects this dual competency requirement, with Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs providing meaningful long-term upside tied to the parent company's enterprise value. Engineering Managers are the organizational architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, building and leading the teams that turn FIDD from a product vision into production infrastructure.

#### Level Mapping

| Fidelity Digital Assets | Coinbase | Galaxy Digital | BitGo | Circle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engineering Manager (DA-M1) | M1 (EM) | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager |
| Senior Engineering Manager (DA-M2) | M2 (Senior EM) | Senior EM | Director of Engineering | Senior Engineering Manager |

Fidelity DA-M1 maps to Coinbase M1 and Circle Engineering Manager. The DA-M2 level is reserved for managers who own multiple teams or a full product vertical (e.g., the entire FIDD platform engineering organization).

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD is Fidelity's most ambitious digital asset initiative, designed for institutional settlement, cross-border treasury operations, and on-chain capital markets.

As an Engineering Manager on the FIDD platform, you are responsible for:

- **Team Building:** Recruiting and retaining a world-class engineering team for the FIDD platform. This includes sourcing from both traditional financial services and crypto-native talent pools — a uniquely challenging hiring mandate.
- **Technical Direction:** Setting the technical roadmap for your team's area of the FIDD platform, whether that's the core issuance engine, the reserve attestation system, cross-chain settlement, or institutional API integrations.
- **Delivery Excellence:** Ensuring your team ships high-quality, auditable code on schedule. In the stablecoin space, bugs are not just engineering problems — they are financial and regulatory risks.
- **Cross-Functional Partnership:** Working closely with Product, Compliance, Legal, and Risk teams to ensure FIDD meets institutional standards. You are the bridge between engineering velocity and regulatory rigor.
- **Culture Building:** Creating an engineering culture that blends Fidelity's institutional discipline with the innovation velocity of crypto-native organizations.

Key negotiation framing:

- **"I'm building the engineering organization that will make FIDD the dominant institutional stablecoin."** This positions the EM role as foundational to Fidelity's digital asset strategy.
- **Talent war context:** The competition for blockchain engineering managers is fierce, with Coinbase, Circle, Anchorage, and well-funded startups all competing for the same small pool of candidates. This scarcity justifies premium compensation.
- **Dual-competency premium:** EMs who can operate at the intersection of TradFi and crypto command a premium because they can translate between two distinct engineering cultures, hiring practices, and technical paradigms.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The Leadership Premium:**
   > "As an Engineering Manager, I'm responsible for hiring and retaining the team that builds FIDD. In today's market, blockchain engineering talent commands a 20-30% premium over standard backend roles. My comp should reflect not just my individual contribution, but the organizational leverage I create by building and leading a high-performing team."

2. **Lever 2 — The Dual-Culture Expertise:**
   > "My background spans both traditional financial services ([X years] at [bank/fintech]) and crypto-native engineering ([Y years] at [crypto company]). This combination is exactly what Fidelity DA needs — someone who can build an engineering organization that meets institutional compliance standards while shipping at crypto speed. Coinbase M1 comp ranges from $340K-$460K TC — I'd expect Fidelity DA to be in that range."

3. **Lever 3 — The Hiring Impact Multiplier:**
   > "I've consistently built engineering teams that outperform — my teams at [Previous Company] delivered [specific outcomes]. At Fidelity DA, my hiring and retention capabilities will directly impact the velocity of FIDD development. I'd like the RSU component to reflect this organizational leverage — a grant in the $320K-$360K range over 4 years."

4. **Lever 4 — The Management Signing Premium:**
   > "Transitioning to a management role at a new company involves significant ramp-up time — learning the organization, building relationships, understanding the technical landscape. A signing bonus of $60K-$90K would offset the productivity dip in my first 90 days and demonstrate Fidelity's commitment to investing in my success."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $250K base and $340K RSUs ($85K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $205K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for blockchain engineering managers in Boston, my competing offer from Coinbase ($420K TC) for an M1 role, and the strategic importance of building the FIDD engineering organization, I'd like to target $245K base, $320K RSUs, a 28% bonus target, and a $75K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $415K. I'm prepared to accept at $225K+ base and $280K+ RSUs as a floor."
