#### Negotiation DNA

The Security Engineer at Fidelity Digital Assets is the guardian of billions of dollars in digital assets, protecting the FIDD stablecoin platform, institutional custody systems, and trading infrastructure from threats ranging from nation-state actors to smart contract exploits to insider attacks. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent), positions Security Engineers as mission-critical defenders whose work directly protects institutional client assets and Fidelity's regulatory standing. Candidates are expected to bring 5-10 years of security engineering experience with demonstrated expertise in application security, infrastructure security, and ideally blockchain-specific security domains (smart contract auditing, cryptographic protocol analysis, custody key management). The role demands fluency in both traditional enterprise security frameworks (SOC 2, PCI-DSS, NIST) and blockchain-native security paradigms (smart contract vulnerabilities, oracle manipulation, bridge exploits, MEV attacks). This dual competency is among the rarest in the industry and commands significant premium compensation. Compensation includes Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs vesting over four years, tied to the parent company's enterprise value. Security Engineers are the trust architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, ensuring that FIDD operates with the security guarantees that institutional clients require before entrusting billions to an on-chain platform.

#### Level Mapping

| Fidelity Digital Assets | Coinbase | Galaxy Digital | BitGo | Circle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Security Engineer (DA-SE1) | Security Engineer (L4/L5) | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer |
| Senior Security Engineer (DA-SE2) | Senior Security Engineer (L5/L6) | Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Engineer |

Fidelity DA-SE1 maps to Coinbase Security Engineer L4/L5 and Circle Security Engineer. DA-SE2 aligns with Coinbase Senior Security Engineer L5/L6 and is the primary level for engineers owning a full security domain (e.g., smart contract security, custody key management, or platform threat detection).

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD is Fidelity's flagship digital asset product, designed for institutional settlement, cross-border treasury operations, and on-chain capital markets infrastructure.

As a Security Engineer on the FIDD platform, you defend the entire stablecoin security surface:

- **Smart Contract Security:** Auditing and hardening the smart contracts that govern FIDD's mint/burn mechanics, reserve attestation, and access controls. A single smart contract vulnerability could result in catastrophic loss of funds — your security reviews are the last line of defense.
- **Custody Key Management Security:** Designing and securing the cryptographic key management infrastructure that protects FIDD's minting authority and reserve attestation keys. This includes HSM architecture, multi-party computation (MPC) protocols, and key ceremony procedures.
- **Threat Detection & Response:** Building real-time threat detection systems that monitor the FIDD platform for suspicious activity — anomalous mint requests, unusual transaction patterns, potential oracle manipulation, and cross-chain bridge exploit attempts.
- **Regulatory Security Compliance:** Ensuring the FIDD platform meets SOC 2 Type II, PCI-DSS, and financial regulatory security requirements. You own the security controls framework and work directly with internal audit and external regulators.
- **Penetration Testing & Red Team:** Conducting regular penetration testing and red team exercises against the FIDD platform, simulating attack scenarios ranging from smart contract exploits to social engineering of key ceremony participants.

Key negotiation framing:

- **"I'm the security engineer protecting billions of dollars in institutional stablecoin assets — one missed vulnerability could result in a catastrophic event."** This positions the security role as directly proportional to the value of assets under protection.
- **Blockchain security scarcity:** Security engineers who combine traditional enterprise security expertise (SOC 2, NIST, pen testing) with blockchain-specific security knowledge (smart contract auditing, MPC protocols, bridge security) represent fewer than 500 qualified professionals globally. This extreme scarcity justifies top-tier compensation.
- **Regulatory imperative:** For a regulated stablecoin issuer like Fidelity, security failures are not just financial events — they are regulatory events that could threaten FIDD's operating license. The security engineer is directly protecting Fidelity's ability to operate in the stablecoin space.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The Asset Protection Premium:**
   > "The FIDD Security Engineer role directly protects billions of dollars in institutional stablecoin assets. My background in [smart contract auditing / cryptographic protocol security / financial infrastructure security] at [Previous Company] enabled me to [prevent / detect / mitigate] threats of [X magnitude]. Coinbase Senior Security Engineer compensation ranges from $320K-$420K TC. Given the asset-protection responsibility and the regulatory stakes of FIDD security, I'd expect compensation in the $310K-$380K range."

2. **Lever 2 — The Blockchain Security Scarcity Argument:**
   > "Security engineers who combine deep enterprise security expertise with blockchain-specific skills — smart contract auditing, MPC protocol security, custody key management — represent an extremely small talent pool. I've spent [X years] building exactly this dual skill set. My work at [Previous Company] directly prevented [specific security outcomes]. I'd like the comp to reflect this rare combination, which commands a 20-30% premium over standard application security roles."

3. **Lever 3 — The RSU Growth Thesis:**
   > "Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs are particularly compelling for a Security Engineer because my work directly protects the FIDD platform's integrity — and by extension, Fidelity's institutional reputation and regulatory standing. A security failure would destroy billions in enterprise value; my success preserves and grows it. I'd like to explore a larger initial RSU grant — in the $310K-$338K range over 4 years — to align my compensation with the asset-protection value I provide."

4. **Lever 4 — The Competing Offer Anchor:**
   > "I have a competing offer from [Coinbase / Trail of Bits / Chainalysis] at $[X] total comp for a comparable blockchain security role. I'm prioritizing Fidelity because of the FIDD mission and the opportunity to secure institutional stablecoin infrastructure at the world's largest asset manager, but I need the total package to be within 10% of my best offer. A signing bonus of $50K-$75K would close the Year 1 gap and offset my unvested equity at [Current Employer]."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $248K base and $315K RSUs ($79K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $198K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for security engineers at crypto and financial services firms in Boston, my competing offer from Coinbase ($385K TC) for a Senior Security Engineer role, and the fact that I'm directly protecting billions in institutional stablecoin assets at the world's largest asset manager, I'd like to target $245K base, $305K RSUs, a 28% bonus target, and a $65K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $385K. I'm prepared to accept at $228K+ base and $270K+ RSUs as a floor."
