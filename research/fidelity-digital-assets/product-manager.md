#### Negotiation DNA

The Product Manager at Fidelity Digital Assets defines the product vision and roadmap for institutional-grade digital asset products, including the FIDD stablecoin platform, digital asset custody, and institutional trading infrastructure. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent), positions Product Managers as the strategic bridge between engineering, design, compliance, and business stakeholders. PMs at this level are expected to bring 5-8 years of product experience, ideally spanning financial services, payments, or blockchain products. The role demands fluency in regulatory requirements (SEC, OCC, FinCEN), institutional client needs, and blockchain technology — a rare triple competency that commands premium compensation. Compensation includes Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs vesting over four years, tied to the parent company's enterprise value. Product Managers are the strategic architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, translating the FIDD vision into a product roadmap that serves the world's largest institutional client base.

#### Level Mapping

| Fidelity Digital Assets | Coinbase | Galaxy Digital | BitGo | Circle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Product Manager (DA-PM1) | PM (L5) | Product Manager | Product Manager | Product Manager |
| Senior Product Manager (DA-PM2) | Senior PM (L6) | Senior PM | Senior Product Manager | Senior Product Manager |

Fidelity DA-PM1 maps to Coinbase PM L5 and Circle Product Manager. DA-PM2 aligns with Coinbase Senior PM L6 and is the primary level for candidates leading a full product vertical (e.g., FIDD stablecoin, custody platform, or institutional trading).

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD is Fidelity's flagship digital asset product, designed for institutional settlement, cross-border treasury operations, and on-chain capital markets infrastructure.

As a Product Manager on the FIDD platform, you own the product strategy end-to-end:

- **Product Vision & Roadmap:** Defining the multi-quarter product roadmap for FIDD, balancing institutional client demands (settlement speed, compliance, reporting) with technical feasibility and regulatory constraints.
- **Institutional Client Discovery:** Conducting deep discovery with Fidelity's institutional client base (hedge funds, asset managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds) to understand their stablecoin adoption requirements and pain points.
- **Regulatory Product Design:** Collaborating with Fidelity's legal and compliance teams to design FIDD features that meet regulatory requirements across jurisdictions — embedding compliance into the product, not bolting it on afterward.
- **Competitive Positioning:** Defining FIDD's competitive positioning against USDC (Circle), PYUSD (PayPal), and emerging institutional stablecoins. Your product decisions determine whether FIDD captures the institutional stablecoin market.
- **Go-to-Market Strategy:** Partnering with institutional sales and marketing teams to drive FIDD adoption among Fidelity's 40M+ client base.

Key negotiation framing:

- **"I'm not just managing a product — I'm defining the product strategy for what could become Fidelity's largest digital asset revenue line."** This positions the PM role as a strategic business function with direct P&L implications.
- **Regulatory product expertise:** PMs who can navigate both product-market fit and regulatory compliance simultaneously are exceptionally rare. This dual competency justifies a premium over standard tech PM compensation.
- **Distribution leverage:** Fidelity's existing institutional relationships give the FIDD PM unmatched distribution potential. Your product decisions directly influence adoption across the world's largest asset management network.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The Product Strategy Premium:**
   > "The FIDD Product Manager role is fundamentally a business strategy position — I'm defining the product roadmap for Fidelity's stablecoin platform, a potential multi-billion dollar revenue line. Coinbase Senior PM compensation ranges from $280K-$380K TC. Given the strategic importance of FIDD and the regulatory complexity of the product, I'd expect compensation in the $280K-$330K range."

2. **Lever 2 — The Regulatory Product Expertise:**
   > "My background combines deep product management experience with [X years] in regulated financial products. Understanding how to build products that satisfy both institutional clients and regulatory bodies is a rare skill set. I'd like the comp to reflect this dual competency — comparable to what firms like Coinbase, Circle, and Stripe pay for PMs with financial services regulatory expertise."

3. **Lever 3 — The RSU Growth Thesis:**
   > "Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs are compelling because the FIDD platform has the potential to be a significant growth catalyst for the parent company's enterprise value. I'd like to explore a larger initial RSU grant — in the $280K-$300K range over 4 years — to align my compensation with the long-term value I'll be creating through product strategy and market adoption."

4. **Lever 4 — The Competing Offer Anchor:**
   > "I have a competing offer from [Coinbase / Circle / Stripe] at $[X] total comp for a comparable product leadership role. I'm prioritizing Fidelity because of the FIDD mission and the institutional distribution advantage, but I need the total package to be within 10-15% of my best offer. A signing bonus of $40K-$60K would close the Year 1 gap."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $210K base and $280K RSUs ($70K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $168K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for product managers at crypto-native firms in Boston, my competing offer from Coinbase ($310K TC) for a Senior PM role, and the strategic importance of leading FIDD's product roadmap, I'd like to target $205K base, $265K RSUs, a 25% bonus target, and a $50K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $325K. I'm prepared to accept at $192K+ base and $230K+ RSUs as a floor."
