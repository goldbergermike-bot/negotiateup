#### Negotiation DNA

The Solutions Architect at Fidelity Digital Assets is the technical bridge between Fidelity's institutional client base and its digital asset platform capabilities, designing bespoke integration architectures that connect the FIDD stablecoin platform, digital asset custody, and trading infrastructure to the complex technical ecosystems of the world's largest financial institutions. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent), positions Solutions Architects as client-facing technical leaders who translate institutional requirements into scalable, compliant platform architectures. Candidates are expected to bring 8-12 years of experience with demonstrated expertise in enterprise systems architecture, API design, financial services integration patterns, and ideally blockchain/digital asset infrastructure. The role demands equal fluency in technical architecture and client-facing communication — the ability to design a multi-chain settlement integration in the morning and present it to a hedge fund CTO in the afternoon. Compensation includes Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs vesting over four years, tied to the parent company's enterprise value. Solutions Architects are the integration architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, designing the technical pathways that connect FIDD to the global financial ecosystem.

Fidelity DA-SA1 maps to Coinbase Solutions Architect L5 and Circle Solutions Architect. DA-SA2 aligns with Coinbase Principal Solutions Architect L6 and is reserved for architects who own the technical integration strategy for an entire client segment (e.g., hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, or prime brokers).

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD is Fidelity's flagship digital asset product, designed for institutional settlement, cross-border treasury operations, and on-chain capital markets infrastructure.

As a Solutions Architect for the FIDD platform, you design the integration layer that connects FIDD to institutional clients:

- **Client Integration Architecture:** Designing bespoke integration architectures for Fidelity's institutional clients — hedge funds, asset managers, pension funds, prime brokers — that connect their existing treasury management systems, OMS/EMS platforms, and settlement workflows to the FIDD stablecoin platform via APIs, SDKs, and custom middleware.
- **Multi-Chain Settlement Design:** Architecting cross-chain settlement solutions that enable institutional clients to use FIDD across Ethereum, Solana, and Fidelity's proprietary settlement layer based on their specific operational requirements and risk tolerances.
- **Compliance-by-Design:** Embedding regulatory compliance into every integration architecture — ensuring KYC/AML screening, sanctions checks, and audit trail generation are native to the integration, not bolted on after the fact.
- **Reference Architecture Development:** Creating reusable reference architectures, integration patterns, and technical documentation that accelerate FIDD adoption across Fidelity's institutional client base.
- **Technical Pre-Sales:** Partnering with institutional sales teams during pre-sales engagements, providing technical credibility and custom architecture proposals that convert prospects into FIDD adopters.

Key negotiation framing:

- **"I'm the technical architect who translates Fidelity's institutional client relationships into live FIDD integrations — every integration I design directly drives stablecoin AUM growth."** This positions the Solutions Architect as a direct revenue enabler.
- **Enterprise integration expertise:** Architects who understand institutional financial workflows (OMS/EMS, treasury management, prime brokerage) and can integrate them with blockchain-native stablecoin infrastructure are among the rarest talent profiles in digital assets.
- **Client-facing technical leadership:** The ability to design complex architectures and present them convincingly to institutional CTOs and CIOs is a dual competency that commands premium compensation.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The Revenue Enablement Premium:**
   > "Every FIDD integration I design directly drives institutional adoption and stablecoin AUM growth. My background architecting enterprise integrations at [Previous Company] resulted in $[X]M in new revenue through technical design and client engagement. Coinbase Principal Solutions Architect compensation ranges from $300K-$400K TC. Given the direct revenue impact of FIDD integrations, I'd expect compensation in the $290K-$350K range."

2. **Lever 2 — The Institutional Integration Expertise:**
   > "Integrating FIDD with institutional treasury systems, OMS/EMS platforms, and prime brokerage workflows requires deep domain expertise in both enterprise financial architecture and blockchain infrastructure. My [X years] designing integrations at [banks / asset managers / fintech firms] is directly transferable to the FIDD platform. I'd like the comp to reflect this specialized intersection of institutional finance and blockchain architecture."

3. **Lever 3 — The RSU Growth Thesis:**
   > "Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs are particularly compelling for a Solutions Architect because every successful FIDD integration I design directly increases the platform's AUM and transaction volume — key drivers of Fidelity's enterprise value. I'd like to explore a larger initial RSU grant — in the $295K-$320K range over 4 years — to align my compensation with the institutional adoption impact of my work."

4. **Lever 4 — The Competing Offer Anchor:**
   > "I have a competing offer from [AWS / Coinbase / a consulting firm] at $[X] total comp for a comparable solutions architecture role. I'm prioritizing Fidelity because of the FIDD mission and the opportunity to architect institutional stablecoin integrations at scale, but I need the total package to be within 10-15% of my best offer. A signing bonus of $45K-$70K would close the Year 1 gap."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $242K base and $300K RSUs ($75K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $192K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for solutions architects at crypto and enterprise financial services firms in Boston, my competing offer from Coinbase ($365K TC) for a Principal Solutions Architect role, and the direct revenue impact of designing institutional FIDD integrations, I'd like to target $238K base, $290K RSUs, a 25% bonus target, and a $58K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $360K. I'm prepared to accept at $218K+ base and $255K+ RSUs as a floor."
