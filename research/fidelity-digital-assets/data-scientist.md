#### Negotiation DNA

The Data Scientist at Fidelity Digital Assets applies quantitative rigor to the intersection of blockchain analytics, institutional finance, and stablecoin operations. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent), positions Data Scientists as the analytical architects who transform on-chain data, market microstructure signals, and institutional client behavior into actionable intelligence that powers the FIDD stablecoin platform, digital asset custody, and institutional trading products. Candidates are expected to bring 4-8 years of data science experience with demonstrated expertise in statistical modeling, machine learning, and ideally blockchain/cryptocurrency analytics. The role demands fluency in both traditional quantitative finance methodologies and emerging on-chain data paradigms — a dual competency that is exceptionally rare and commands premium compensation. Compensation includes Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs vesting over four years, tied to the parent company's enterprise value. Data Scientists are the analytical architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, building the intelligence layer that informs FIDD's reserve management, risk modeling, and market strategy.

#### Level Mapping

| Fidelity Digital Assets | Coinbase | Galaxy Digital | BitGo | Circle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Data Scientist (DA-DS1) | Data Scientist (L4) | Quantitative Analyst | Data Scientist | Data Scientist |
| Senior Data Scientist (DA-DS2) | Senior Data Scientist (L5) | Senior Quant | Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist |

Fidelity DA-DS1 maps to Coinbase Data Scientist L4 and Circle Data Scientist. DA-DS2 aligns with Coinbase Senior Data Scientist L5 and is the primary level for candidates leading analytics for a full product vertical (e.g., FIDD reserve analytics, on-chain risk modeling, or institutional client intelligence).

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD is Fidelity's flagship digital asset product, designed for institutional settlement, cross-border treasury operations, and on-chain capital markets infrastructure.

As a Data Scientist on the FIDD platform, you build the analytical intelligence layer:

- **Reserve Optimization Modeling:** Building quantitative models that optimize FIDD's US Treasury reserve composition — balancing yield, liquidity, and duration to maximize reserve efficiency while maintaining the 1:1 backing guarantee.
- **On-Chain Flow Analytics:** Developing real-time analytics pipelines that monitor FIDD mint/burn patterns, cross-chain flows, and institutional adoption metrics. These insights directly inform product and business strategy.
- **Risk Modeling & Anomaly Detection:** Creating statistical models that detect anomalous transaction patterns, potential market manipulation, and systemic risk indicators across the FIDD ecosystem — critical for regulatory compliance and institutional trust.
- **Institutional Client Intelligence:** Analyzing client behavior data to identify adoption patterns, churn risk, and cross-sell opportunities across Fidelity's institutional client base. Your models directly influence FIDD's go-to-market strategy.
- **Market Microstructure Analysis:** Studying FIDD's on-chain market dynamics — liquidity depth, arbitrage patterns, and peg stability — to inform protocol design and market-making strategy.

Key negotiation framing:

- **"I'm building the intelligence layer that makes FIDD a data-driven stablecoin platform — not just a financial product, but an analytically optimized one."** This positions the data science role as a strategic differentiator for FIDD's competitive positioning.
- **On-chain analytics expertise:** Data scientists who combine traditional quantitative finance skills with blockchain-native analytics capabilities are among the rarest talent profiles in the industry. This scarcity justifies premium compensation.
- **Revenue impact:** Reserve optimization models alone can generate tens of millions in additional yield for FIDD's Treasury-backed reserves. The data scientist directly influences FIDD's profitability.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The Quantitative Premium:**
   > "The FIDD Data Scientist role requires a unique combination of traditional quantitative finance modeling and on-chain blockchain analytics. My background in [statistical modeling / machine learning / quantitative research] at [Previous Company] combined with my blockchain analytics experience directly maps to the FIDD platform's core analytical needs. Coinbase Senior Data Scientist compensation ranges from $280K-$380K TC. Given the specialized quantitative requirements of FIDD reserve modeling and on-chain analytics, I'd expect compensation in the $280K-$340K range."

2. **Lever 2 — The Revenue Impact Argument:**
   > "The reserve optimization models I'll build for FIDD directly impact the bottom line — even a 5-10 basis point improvement in Treasury reserve yield on a multi-billion dollar reserve generates tens of millions in annual revenue. I'd like the comp to reflect this direct P&L impact, with a base salary and bonus structure that rewards quantifiable financial outcomes."

3. **Lever 3 — The RSU Growth Thesis:**
   > "Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs are particularly compelling for a data science role because the analytical intelligence I'll build directly influences FIDD adoption and profitability — both key drivers of Fidelity's enterprise value. I'd like to explore a larger initial RSU grant — in the $275K-$300K range over 4 years — to align my compensation with the long-term value impact of the analytical infrastructure I'll create."

4. **Lever 4 — The Competing Offer Anchor:**
   > "I have a competing offer from [Two Sigma / Citadel Securities / Coinbase] at $[X] total comp for a comparable quantitative/data science role. I'm prioritizing Fidelity because of the FIDD mission and the opportunity to build analytics at the intersection of institutional finance and blockchain, but I need the total package to be within 10-15% of my best offer. A signing bonus of $40K-$65K would close the Year 1 gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $225K base and $280K RSUs ($70K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $178K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for data scientists at crypto and quantitative finance firms in Boston, my competing offer from Coinbase ($340K TC) for a Senior Data Scientist role, and the specialized nature of building reserve optimization and on-chain analytics models for FIDD, I'd like to target $222K base, $268K RSUs, a 25% bonus target, and a $55K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $345K. I'm prepared to accept at $205K+ base and $235K+ RSUs as a floor."
