#### Negotiation DNA

The Senior Software Engineer at Fidelity Digital Assets is the critical workhorse of the engineering organization — owning complex subsystems end-to-end, mentoring junior engineers, and driving technical decisions that shape the FIDD stablecoin platform and broader digital asset infrastructure. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent), positions Senior Engineers as the technical backbone of institutional-grade crypto products. At the Senior level, Fidelity expects candidates to bring 5-10 years of experience with demonstrated ownership of production systems, ideally in financial services, payments, or blockchain infrastructure. Compensation at this level is a significant step up from L4, with Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs becoming a meaningful component of total comp. Senior Engineers are architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, designing the systems that process billions in digital asset transactions while meeting the regulatory and compliance standards of the world's largest asset management ecosystem.

#### Level Mapping

| Fidelity Digital Assets | Coinbase | Galaxy Digital | BitGo | Circle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Senior Software Engineer (DA-L5) | L5 (IC5) | Staff SWE | Staff Engineer | Senior Software Engineer II |
| Senior Software Engineer (DA-L5+) | L5+ (IC5 Senior) | Staff SWE+ | Principal Engineer | Staff Software Engineer |

Fidelity DA-L5 aligns with Coinbase IC5 — this is where compensation negotiations become most competitive. Many candidates at this level receive offers from multiple crypto-native firms (Coinbase, Circle, Anchorage, Fireblocks), and Fidelity's value proposition centers on brand stability, regulatory backing, and the FIDD stablecoin mission.

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD represents Fidelity's boldest move into on-chain financial infrastructure, designed for institutional settlement, cross-border treasury operations, and digital capital markets.

As a Senior Software Engineer, you are a primary architect of the FIDD platform:

- **Mint/Burn Engine:** Designing the core issuance and redemption mechanics that process institutional-scale FIDD transactions with sub-second latency and full audit trails.
- **Reserve Attestation Pipeline:** Building the automated proof-of-reserve systems that continuously verify FIDD's 1:1 backing by US Treasury securities — a critical trust layer for institutional adoption.
- **Cross-Chain Settlement:** Engineering the bridge infrastructure that enables FIDD to operate across Ethereum, Solana, and Fidelity's proprietary settlement layer.
- **Compliance Integration:** Embedding KYC/AML/sanctions screening directly into the FIDD transaction lifecycle, ensuring every mint and transfer meets regulatory requirements.

Key negotiation framing:

- **"I'm not just a software engineer — I'm building the settlement layer for the largest asset manager in the world."** This framing elevates the role beyond typical crypto engineering and into institutional finance territory.
- **Regulatory moat:** FIDD operates under Fidelity's existing regulatory umbrella, giving it a compliance advantage that pure-play crypto firms cannot match. This stability is a selling point for candidates and a justification for premium compensation.
- **Distribution advantage:** With 40M+ existing clients and $14T+ AUM, Fidelity's distribution network for FIDD is unmatched in the stablecoin space. Senior Engineers building this infrastructure are directly enabling the next generation of institutional digital payments.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The Senior IC Premium:**
   > "At the Senior Engineer level, I'm expected to own critical subsystems end-to-end. Given that the FIDD platform is Fidelity's flagship digital asset product, I'd like comp that reflects the ownership and impact of this role. Coinbase IC5 compensation in Boston ranges from $290K-$410K TC — I'd expect Fidelity DA to be competitive with that range given the mission-critical nature of FIDD."

2. **Lever 2 — The Crypto-to-TradFi Bridge Premium:**
   > "My background uniquely combines [X years] of blockchain infrastructure experience with [Y years] in traditional financial systems. This dual expertise is exactly what FIDD needs — someone who understands both smart contract security and institutional-grade SLAs. I'd like the comp to reflect this specialized intersection, which commands a 15-20% premium over standard backend engineering roles."

3. **Lever 3 — The RSU Valuation Conversation:**
   > "I understand Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs are tied to the parent company's enterprise value. Given Fidelity's consistent growth trajectory and the catalytic potential of FIDD, I'm bullish on the equity component. However, I'd like to discuss either (a) a larger initial RSU grant to reflect my confidence in Fidelity's digital asset strategy, or (b) a front-loaded vesting schedule (40/30/20/10) to accelerate my alignment with the company's near-term milestones."

4. **Lever 4 — The Unvested Equity Make-Whole:**
   > "I'm leaving approximately $[X] in unvested equity at [Current Employer]. A signing bonus of $55K-$85K or a supplemental RSU grant would bridge this gap and allow me to make a clean transition without a compensation dip in Year 1."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $225K base and $280K RSUs ($70K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $185K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for senior blockchain infrastructure engineers in Boston, competing offers from Coinbase ($370K TC) and Circle ($340K TC), and the specialized nature of FIDD stablecoin architecture, I'd like to target $220K base, $270K RSUs, a 25% bonus target, and a $65K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $375K. I'm prepared to accept at $205K+ base and $240K+ RSUs as a floor."
