#### Negotiation DNA

The Staff Software Engineer at Fidelity Digital Assets is a technical leader who shapes the architecture of entire product verticals — from the FIDD stablecoin platform to digital asset custody and institutional trading infrastructure. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent), reserves the Staff title for engineers with 10+ years of experience who can drive technical strategy across multiple teams and influence the broader engineering organization. At this level, you are expected to define technical roadmaps, represent Fidelity DA in industry working groups (e.g., stablecoin standards bodies, blockchain protocol governance), and make architectural decisions with multi-year implications. Compensation includes a significant +15-25% Digital Assets Premium over standard Fidelity Investments Staff Engineer bands, reflecting the scarcity of talent at the intersection of institutional finance and blockchain infrastructure. Staff Engineers are the principal architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, setting the technical vision for FIDD and the broader digital asset platform.

#### Level Mapping

| Fidelity Digital Assets | Coinbase | Galaxy Digital | BitGo | Circle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Staff Software Engineer (DA-L6) | L6 (Staff) | Principal SWE | Distinguished Engineer | Staff Software Engineer |
| Staff Software Engineer (DA-L6+) | L6+ (Staff Senior) | Distinguished SWE | Fellow | Principal Software Engineer |

The Staff level at Fidelity DA is highly competitive with Coinbase L6 and Circle Staff roles. At this level, candidates typically hold competing offers from multiple firms, and Fidelity's negotiation leverage centers on the unique combination of institutional stability, regulatory backing, and the FIDD stablecoin mission.

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD is the centerpiece of Fidelity's digital asset strategy, designed to become the settlement layer for institutional crypto transactions.

As a Staff Software Engineer, you are the **principal architect** of the FIDD ecosystem:

- **System Architecture:** Defining the end-to-end technical architecture of the FIDD platform — from the issuance layer through settlement, compliance, and cross-chain interoperability. Your architecture decisions will govern how billions of dollars flow through Fidelity's on-chain infrastructure.
- **Protocol Design:** Leading the design of FIDD's smart contract protocols, including mint/burn mechanics, reserve attestation, and institutional access controls. You work directly with Fidelity's legal and compliance teams to ensure the protocol meets regulatory requirements across jurisdictions.
- **Cross-Team Technical Leadership:** Serving as the technical point of contact between the FIDD platform team, the custody engineering team, the trading infrastructure team, and external partners (exchanges, prime brokers, DeFi protocols).
- **Industry Representation:** Representing Fidelity DA in stablecoin standards working groups, blockchain protocol governance discussions, and industry conferences. Your voice shapes how the industry thinks about institutional stablecoins.
- **Technical Due Diligence:** Leading technical evaluation of potential acquisitions, partnerships, and protocol integrations for the FIDD ecosystem.

Key negotiation framing:

- **"At the Staff level, I'm not just building systems — I'm defining the technical strategy for Fidelity's entire stablecoin platform."** This positions the role as a strategic leadership function, not just an IC contribution.
- **Scarcity premium:** There are fewer than 200 engineers globally who combine deep blockchain infrastructure expertise with institutional finance systems knowledge at the Staff level. This scarcity justifies the +15-25% Digital Assets Premium.
- **Revenue impact:** FIDD has the potential to become a multi-billion dollar revenue line for Fidelity. Staff Engineers directly influence the technical decisions that determine FIDD's scalability, reliability, and market adoption.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The Staff-Level Architecture Premium:**
   > "At the Staff level, I'm expected to define the technical architecture for the entire FIDD stablecoin platform — decisions with multi-year, multi-billion dollar implications. Coinbase L6 compensation ranges from $420K-$580K TC in Boston. Given the strategic importance of FIDD and the +15-25% Digital Assets Premium, I'd expect a package in the $400K-$540K range."

2. **Lever 2 — The Scarcity Argument:**
   > "The intersection of institutional-grade financial systems and blockchain infrastructure architecture is an extremely narrow talent pool. I've spent [X years] building exactly this combination of skills. My background in [specific systems / protocols / architectures] is directly relevant to the FIDD platform's core technical challenges. This scarcity should be reflected in both the base salary and the RSU grant."

3. **Lever 3 — The Equity Growth Thesis:**
   > "Fidelity's Profit-Based RSUs are particularly compelling at the Staff level because FIDD has the potential to be a transformative revenue driver for the parent company. I'd like to discuss a larger-than-standard initial RSU grant — in the $450K-$520K range over 4 years — to align my compensation with the long-term value I'll be creating for FIDD and the broader Fidelity digital asset strategy."

4. **Lever 4 — The Total Comp Benchmark:**
   > "My competing offers from [Coinbase / Anchorage Digital / a16z Crypto] range from $480K-$560K TC. I'm prioritizing Fidelity because of the FIDD mission and the institutional backing, but I need the total package — including base, RSUs, bonus, and signing — to be within 10% of my best offer. A signing bonus of $80K-$120K would bridge the Year 1 gap while my RSUs begin vesting."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $295K base and $480K RSUs ($120K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $248K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for Staff-level blockchain infrastructure engineers, my competing offers from Coinbase ($520K TC) and Anchorage Digital ($490K TC), and the +15-25% Digital Assets Premium that the market commands for institutional stablecoin expertise, I'd like to target $290K base, $460K RSUs, a 30% bonus target, and a $95K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $530K. I'm prepared to accept at $270K+ base and $400K+ RSUs as a floor."
