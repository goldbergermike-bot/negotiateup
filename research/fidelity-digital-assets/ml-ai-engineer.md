#### Negotiation DNA

The ML/AI Engineer at Fidelity Digital Assets builds the machine learning and artificial intelligence systems that power fraud detection, risk modeling, reserve optimization, and intelligent automation across the FIDD stablecoin platform and broader digital asset infrastructure. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent), positions ML/AI Engineers as the intelligence layer architects who transform raw blockchain data, market signals, and institutional client behavior into predictive models and automated systems that give FIDD a decisive competitive advantage. Candidates are expected to bring 5-10 years of ML/AI engineering experience with demonstrated expertise in production machine learning systems, deep learning, and ideally applications in financial services, fraud detection, or blockchain analytics. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects the extraordinary market demand for ML/AI engineers combined with the scarcity of professionals who understand both cutting-edge AI and the specific challenges of institutional digital asset infrastructure. Compensation includes Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs vesting over four years, tied to the parent company's enterprise value. ML/AI Engineers are the intelligence architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, building the predictive and autonomous systems that make FIDD smarter, safer, and more efficient than any competing stablecoin platform.

#### Level Mapping

| Fidelity Digital Assets | Coinbase | Galaxy Digital | BitGo | Circle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ML/AI Engineer (DA-ML1) | ML Engineer (L5) | ML Engineer | ML Engineer | ML Engineer |
| Senior ML/AI Engineer (DA-ML2) | Senior ML Engineer (L6) | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer |

Fidelity DA-ML1 maps to Coinbase ML Engineer L5 and Circle ML Engineer. DA-ML2 aligns with Coinbase Senior ML Engineer L6 and is the primary level for engineers owning a full ML domain (e.g., fraud detection models, reserve optimization, or intelligent compliance automation). The +15-25% AI Premium applies at both levels.

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD is Fidelity's flagship digital asset product, designed for institutional settlement, cross-border treasury operations, and on-chain capital markets infrastructure.

As an ML/AI Engineer on the FIDD platform, you build the intelligence systems that differentiate FIDD from every other stablecoin:

- **Fraud Detection & AML Models:** Building machine learning models that detect fraudulent transactions, money laundering patterns, and sanctions evasion across the FIDD ecosystem in real-time. These models must achieve extremely high precision (institutional clients cannot tolerate false positives) while catching sophisticated adversarial attacks.
- **Reserve Optimization AI:** Developing AI-driven optimization models that manage FIDD's US Treasury reserve portfolio — dynamically adjusting duration, yield, and liquidity parameters to maximize reserve efficiency while maintaining the 1:1 backing guarantee and meeting regulatory requirements.
- **Anomaly Detection Systems:** Building deep learning models that detect anomalous on-chain activity, market microstructure anomalies, and potential oracle manipulation attempts across the FIDD ecosystem. These systems serve as an early warning layer for both security and compliance teams.
- **Intelligent Compliance Automation:** Engineering ML-powered automation for KYC/AML processes, sanctions screening, and regulatory reporting — reducing manual compliance burden while increasing detection accuracy and audit trail completeness.
- **Predictive Analytics Platform:** Building the ML platform infrastructure (feature stores, model serving, experiment tracking, A/B testing) that enables rapid iteration on predictive models across the FIDD ecosystem.

Key negotiation framing:

- **"I'm building the AI that makes FIDD the most intelligent stablecoin platform in the market — fraud detection, reserve optimization, and compliance automation that no competitor can match."** This positions the ML/AI role as a strategic differentiator, not just a technical function.
- **AI Premium justification:** The +15-25% AI Premium reflects three scarcity factors: (1) the extraordinary market demand for ML/AI talent globally, (2) the rarity of ML engineers with financial services domain expertise, and (3) the near-nonexistence of ML engineers who additionally understand blockchain and stablecoin infrastructure.
- **Revenue and risk impact:** ML/AI models directly generate revenue (reserve optimization), prevent losses (fraud detection), and reduce costs (compliance automation). The ROI of a strong ML/AI engineer is quantifiable and substantial.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The AI Premium Argument:**
   > "The ML/AI Engineer role at Fidelity DA sits at the intersection of three scarce skill sets: production machine learning engineering, institutional financial services expertise, and blockchain infrastructure knowledge. This triple intersection commands a +15-25% premium over standard ML roles. Coinbase Senior ML Engineer compensation ranges from $380K-$500K TC. Given the AI Premium and the strategic importance of ML to FIDD's competitive positioning, I'd expect compensation in the $380K-$460K range."

2. **Lever 2 — The Quantifiable Impact Argument:**
   > "The ML systems I build will have directly quantifiable financial impact: fraud detection models prevent losses, reserve optimization generates yield, and compliance automation reduces headcount costs. At [Previous Company], my ML systems [prevented $X in fraud / generated $Y in optimization gains / automated $Z in manual processes]. I'd like the comp to reflect this measurable ROI, with performance bonuses tied to model outcomes."

3. **Lever 3 — The RSU Growth Thesis:**
   > "Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs are exceptionally compelling for an ML/AI role because the intelligence systems I build directly amplify FIDD's competitive advantage — smarter fraud detection, optimized reserves, and automated compliance all drive platform adoption and profitability. I'd like to explore a larger initial RSU grant — in the $430K-$460K range over 4 years — to align my compensation with the compounding value of the ML infrastructure I'll create."

4. **Lever 4 — The Competing Offer Anchor:**
   > "I have competing offers from [Google DeepMind / OpenAI / Two Sigma] at $[X] total comp for ML/AI roles. I'm prioritizing Fidelity because of the FIDD mission and the opportunity to apply ML at the intersection of institutional finance and blockchain — a uniquely impactful domain. However, I need the total package, including the AI Premium, to be within 10% of my best offer. A signing bonus of $65K-$100K would bridge the Year 1 gap and offset my unvested equity at [Current Employer]."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $285K base and $430K RSUs ($108K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $225K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for ML/AI engineers at top-tier tech and crypto firms in Boston, my competing offers from Google ($450K TC) and Coinbase ($470K TC), and the +15-25% AI Premium that the market commands for ML engineers with institutional finance and blockchain expertise, I'd like to target $278K base, $420K RSUs, a 30% bonus target, and a $85K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $470K. I'm prepared to accept at $258K+ base and $375K+ RSUs as a floor."
