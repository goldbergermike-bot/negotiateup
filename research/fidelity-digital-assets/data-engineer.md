#### Negotiation DNA

The Data Engineer at Fidelity Digital Assets builds and maintains the data infrastructure that powers the FIDD stablecoin platform, digital asset custody analytics, institutional trading reporting, and regulatory compliance data pipelines. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent), positions Data Engineers as the plumbing architects who ensure that every transaction, reserve attestation, compliance event, and client interaction flows through reliable, auditable, and scalable data systems. Candidates are expected to bring 4-8 years of data engineering experience with demonstrated expertise in building production data pipelines, data warehouse architectures, and real-time streaming systems, ideally in financial services, payments, or blockchain data infrastructure. The role uniquely requires fluency in both traditional data engineering paradigms (batch ETL, data warehousing, SQL) and blockchain-native data patterns (on-chain indexing, event log processing, multi-chain data normalization). Compensation includes Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs vesting over four years, tied to the parent company's enterprise value. Data Engineers are the data infrastructure architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, building the pipelines that make FIDD's operations transparent, auditable, and analytically accessible.

#### Level Mapping

| Fidelity Digital Assets | Coinbase | Galaxy Digital | BitGo | Circle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Data Engineer (DA-DE1) | Data Engineer (L4) | Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data Engineer |
| Senior Data Engineer (DA-DE2) | Senior Data Engineer (L5) | Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer |

Fidelity DA-DE1 maps to Coinbase Data Engineer L4 and Circle Data Engineer. DA-DE2 aligns with Coinbase Senior Data Engineer L5 and is the primary level for engineers owning a full data domain (e.g., FIDD on-chain data pipeline, regulatory reporting data warehouse, or institutional client analytics infrastructure).

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD is Fidelity's flagship digital asset product, designed for institutional settlement, cross-border treasury operations, and on-chain capital markets infrastructure.

As a Data Engineer on the FIDD platform, you build the data foundation that powers every aspect of the stablecoin ecosystem:

- **On-Chain Data Indexing:** Building real-time data pipelines that index FIDD transactions across multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, Fidelity's proprietary settlement layer), normalizing on-chain event data into a unified analytical layer that supports product analytics, compliance reporting, and institutional client dashboards.
- **Reserve Attestation Data Pipeline:** Engineering the data infrastructure that continuously verifies and publishes FIDD's US Treasury reserve backing — processing data from custodial accounts, Treasury securities databases, and on-chain token supply to maintain real-time proof-of-reserve transparency.
- **Regulatory Reporting Infrastructure:** Building the data warehouse and reporting pipelines that generate regulatory filings, audit reports, and compliance documentation required by financial regulators. Every FIDD transaction must be traceable, attributable, and reportable — your data infrastructure makes this possible.
- **Real-Time Streaming Architecture:** Designing streaming data systems (Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming) that process FIDD transactions in real-time, enabling sub-second analytics, instant compliance screening, and live institutional client dashboards.
- **Data Quality & Governance:** Implementing data quality frameworks, lineage tracking, and governance controls that ensure FIDD's data infrastructure meets the audit and compliance standards of the world's largest asset manager.

Key negotiation framing:

- **"I'm building the data infrastructure that makes FIDD's operations transparent, auditable, and compliant — every regulatory filing and reserve attestation depends on my pipelines."** This positions the data engineering role as foundational to FIDD's regulatory standing and institutional trust.
- **Blockchain data expertise:** Data engineers who understand both traditional data warehousing and blockchain-native data patterns (on-chain indexing, event log processing, multi-chain normalization) are a rare talent profile that commands premium compensation.
- **Compliance data is mission-critical:** In regulated stablecoin operations, the data infrastructure is not a supporting function — it is a regulatory requirement. Data pipeline failures can trigger compliance violations and regulatory action.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The Regulated Data Infrastructure Premium:**
   > "The FIDD Data Engineer role builds the data infrastructure that powers regulatory compliance, reserve attestation, and institutional client reporting for a regulated stablecoin issuer. My background in [financial data engineering / regulatory reporting systems / real-time streaming architecture] at [Previous Company] directly maps to the FIDD platform's core data infrastructure needs. Coinbase Senior Data Engineer compensation ranges from $270K-$360K TC. Given the regulatory data requirements of FIDD, I'd expect compensation in the $268K-$330K range."

2. **Lever 2 — The Blockchain Data Expertise Argument:**
   > "Building data infrastructure for FIDD requires a specialized skill set — on-chain transaction indexing, multi-chain data normalization, reserve attestation pipelines — layered on top of traditional data engineering competencies. My experience building [blockchain data pipelines / on-chain analytics infrastructure] at [Previous Company] is directly transferable to FIDD. I'd like the comp to reflect this dual data engineering expertise, which commands a 15-20% premium over standard data engineering roles."

3. **Lever 3 — The RSU Growth Thesis:**
   > "Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs are compelling because the data infrastructure I build directly enables FIDD's regulatory compliance and institutional transparency — both essential for platform growth and client trust. I'd like to explore a larger initial RSU grant — in the $262K-$285K range over 4 years — to align my compensation with the foundational nature of the data infrastructure I'll create."

4. **Lever 4 — The Competing Offer Anchor:**
   > "I have a competing offer from [Coinbase / Databricks / Snowflake] at $[X] total comp for a comparable data engineering role. I'm prioritizing Fidelity because of the FIDD mission and the opportunity to build data infrastructure for institutional stablecoin operations, but I need the total package to be within 10-15% of my best offer. A signing bonus of $38K-$58K would close the Year 1 gap."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $218K base and $262K RSUs ($65K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $175K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for data engineers at crypto and financial services firms in Boston, my competing offer from Coinbase ($335K TC) for a Senior Data Engineer role, and the mission-critical nature of building FIDD's regulatory data infrastructure and on-chain data pipelines, I'd like to target $215K base, $255K RSUs, a 24% bonus target, and a $48K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $330K. I'm prepared to accept at $198K+ base and $225K+ RSUs as a floor."
