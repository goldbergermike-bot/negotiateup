#### Negotiation DNA

The Software Engineer role at Fidelity Digital Assets sits at the intersection of traditional financial infrastructure and cutting-edge blockchain technology. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent company), is building the rails for institutional-grade digital asset custody, trading, and now stablecoin issuance with the Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD). Engineers in this role are architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, building the foundational systems that bridge traditional finance and decentralized protocols. Compensation reflects Fidelity's private-company equity model using Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs, which vest over four years and track the growth of Fidelity's overall enterprise value — a unique and historically strong performer.

#### Level Mapping

| Fidelity Digital Assets | Coinbase | Galaxy Digital | BitGo | Circle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Software Engineer (DA-L3) | L3 (IC3) | SWE II | Engineer II | Software Engineer |
| Software Engineer (DA-L4) | L4 (IC4) | Senior SWE | Senior Engineer | Senior Software Engineer |

Fidelity DA's leveling borrows from Fidelity Investments' internal bands but adds a "Digital Assets Premium" modifier. DA-L3 maps roughly to a Coinbase IC3 or Circle Software Engineer. DA-L4 aligns with Coinbase IC4 and is the most common entry point for candidates with 2-5 years of experience.

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD is not a retail play; it is designed for institutional settlement, cross-border treasury operations, and on-chain capital markets infrastructure. As a Software Engineer on the FIDD platform, you are building the mint/burn mechanics, reserve attestation pipelines, and API integrations that connect FIDD to the $14T+ Fidelity ecosystem.

Key differentiators for negotiation:

- **Regulatory moat:** FIDD operates under Fidelity's existing regulatory framework, giving it a compliance advantage over competitors like USDC (Circle) and PYUSD (PayPal). Frame your work as "building inside the most trusted brand in institutional finance."
- **Treasury-backed stability:** Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, FIDD is backed 1:1 by US Treasury securities — the gold standard of reserve assets. This is a selling point for candidates who want to avoid the reputational risk of crypto volatility.
- **Institutional distribution:** Fidelity's existing relationships with 40M+ retail and institutional clients give FIDD an unmatched distribution advantage. Engineers building FIDD infrastructure are directly enabling the next generation of institutional digital payments.

Use this context to frame yourself as an "Institutional Stablecoin Architect" — not just a software engineer, but a builder of regulated financial infrastructure at unprecedented scale.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The Institutional Premium:**
   > "I'm specifically interested in Fidelity Digital Assets because of the FIDD launch. Building institutional-grade stablecoin infrastructure backed by US Treasuries is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. My experience in [distributed systems / smart contracts / payment infrastructure] directly maps to the FIDD platform's core needs. I'd like the comp to reflect the specialized nature of this work — comparable to what Coinbase and Circle offer for similar blockchain infrastructure roles."

2. **Lever 2 — The Competing Offer Anchor:**
   > "I have a competing offer from [Coinbase / Circle / Anchorage Digital] at $[X] total comp. I'm leaning toward Fidelity because of the FIDD mission and the stability of Fidelity's $14T parent, but I need the package to be within 10-15% of my best offer to make the move."

3. **Lever 3 — The RSU Acceleration Ask:**
   > "Given that Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs are tied to the parent company's enterprise value, I'd like to explore either a front-loaded vesting schedule (40/30/20/10) or a supplemental cash bonus in Year 1 to bridge the gap before my RSUs begin vesting meaningfully."

4. **Lever 4 — The Signing Bonus Bridge:**
   > "I'm leaving unvested equity at my current employer valued at approximately $[X]. A one-time signing bonus of $35K-$55K would offset the forfeiture and remove the last barrier to my accepting this offer."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $170K base and $180K RSUs ($45K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $145K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for blockchain infrastructure engineers in Boston and my competing offer from [Coinbase/Circle] at $260K TC, I'd like to target $168K base, $175K RSUs, and a $40K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $275K. I'm prepared to accept at $160K+ base and $150K+ RSUs as a floor."
