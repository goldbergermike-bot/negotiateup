#### Negotiation DNA

The Product Designer at Fidelity Digital Assets shapes the user experience for institutional-grade digital asset products, including the FIDD stablecoin platform, digital asset custody dashboards, and institutional trading interfaces. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent), expects Product Designers to translate complex blockchain infrastructure and regulatory workflows into intuitive, trust-building experiences for institutional clients — hedge funds, asset managers, pension funds, and corporate treasuries. Designers at this level are expected to bring 4-8 years of product design experience, ideally spanning financial services, fintech, or enterprise SaaS products where trust, compliance, and data density are first-order design challenges. Compensation includes Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs vesting over four years, tied to the parent company's enterprise value. Product Designers are the experience architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, crafting the interfaces and workflows that make FIDD accessible, trustworthy, and indispensable to the world's largest financial institutions.

#### Level Mapping

| Fidelity Digital Assets | Coinbase | Galaxy Digital | BitGo | Circle |

| Product Designer (DA-D1) | Product Designer (L4) | Product Designer | UX Designer | Product Designer |
| Senior Product Designer (DA-D2) | Senior Product Designer (L5) | Senior Designer | Senior UX Designer | Senior Product Designer |

Fidelity DA-D1 maps to Coinbase Product Designer L4 and Circle Product Designer. DA-D2 aligns with Coinbase Senior Product Designer L5 and is the primary level for candidates owning a full product surface (e.g., the FIDD institutional dashboard or custody experience).

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD is Fidelity's flagship digital asset product, designed for institutional settlement, cross-border treasury operations, and on-chain capital markets infrastructure.

As a Product Designer on the FIDD platform, you own the experience layer end-to-end:

- **Institutional Dashboard Design:** Designing the FIDD management dashboard that institutional clients use to mint, redeem, and monitor their stablecoin positions. This interface must convey trust, transparency, and real-time reserve attestation data — design decisions that directly influence institutional adoption.
- **Reserve Attestation UX:** Crafting the user experience for FIDD's proof-of-reserve transparency layer, making complex Treasury-backed reserve data accessible and confidence-building for institutional stakeholders and regulators alike.
- **Compliance Workflow Design:** Designing KYC/AML onboarding flows and transaction monitoring interfaces that embed regulatory compliance seamlessly into the user journey — reducing friction while maintaining institutional-grade audit trails.
- **Cross-Platform Experience:** Ensuring FIDD's institutional experience is coherent across Fidelity's web platform, mobile applications, and API documentation portals.
- **Design System Leadership:** Contributing to and extending Fidelity Digital Assets' design system to support the unique UI patterns required by stablecoin infrastructure — real-time transaction feeds, reserve health indicators, and multi-chain asset views.

Key negotiation framing:

- **"I'm designing the trust layer for institutional stablecoins — the interface that makes billion-dollar clients confident in FIDD."** This positions the design role as a direct driver of institutional adoption and revenue.
- **Institutional design expertise:** Designers who understand institutional finance workflows (portfolio management, compliance reporting, audit trails) and can translate them into digital asset experiences are exceptionally rare. This specialization justifies premium compensation.
- **Trust as a design problem:** In stablecoins, trust is the product. The designer who makes reserve attestation, regulatory compliance, and transaction transparency feel intuitive is directly increasing FIDD's market share.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The Institutional Design Premium:**
   > "Designing for institutional clients at Fidelity DA requires a fundamentally different skill set than consumer crypto design. I need to translate complex financial workflows — reserve attestation, compliance monitoring, multi-chain settlement — into experiences that build trust with the world's most sophisticated financial institutions. Coinbase Senior Product Designer compensation ranges from $220K-$300K TC. Given the institutional complexity and regulatory design requirements of FIDD, I'd expect compensation in the $230K-$270K range."

2. **Lever 2 — The Trust Architecture Argument:**
   > "In the stablecoin space, trust is the product, and the user experience is how trust is communicated. My background designing [institutional dashboards / compliance workflows / financial data visualizations] at [Previous Company] directly maps to the FIDD platform's core design challenges. I'd like the comp to reflect the specialized nature of this work — designing the trust layer for the world's largest asset manager's stablecoin."

3. **Lever 3 — The RSU Growth Thesis:**
   > "Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs are compelling because the FIDD platform's success depends heavily on institutional adoption, which is directly influenced by the product experience I'll be designing. I'd like to explore a larger initial RSU grant — in the $200K-$220K range over 4 years — to align my compensation with the long-term adoption impact of my design work."

4. **Lever 4 — The Competing Offer Anchor:**
   > "I have a competing offer from [Coinbase / Square / Stripe] at $[X] total comp for a comparable product design role in fintech. I'm prioritizing Fidelity because of the FIDD mission and the opportunity to design institutional-grade stablecoin experiences, but I need the total package to be within 10-15% of my best offer. A signing bonus of $30K-$45K would close the Year 1 gap."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $188K base and $200K RSUs ($50K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $148K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for product designers at crypto and fintech firms in Boston, my competing offer from Coinbase ($255K TC) for a Senior Product Designer role, and the specialized nature of designing institutional stablecoin experiences for FIDD, I'd like to target $185K base, $195K RSUs, a 22% bonus target, and a $38K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $272K. I'm prepared to accept at $172K+ base and $170K+ RSUs as a floor."
