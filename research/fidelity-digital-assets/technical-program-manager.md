#### Negotiation DNA

The Technical Program Manager at Fidelity Digital Assets drives the execution of complex, cross-functional programs that span the FIDD stablecoin platform, digital asset custody, institutional trading infrastructure, and regulatory compliance workstreams. Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of Fidelity Investments ($14T+ AUM parent), positions TPMs as the execution backbone of the organization — orchestrating engineering, product, compliance, legal, and operations teams to deliver mission-critical digital asset initiatives on time and within regulatory constraints. Candidates are expected to bring 6-10 years of technical program management experience, ideally in financial services, payments, or blockchain infrastructure where programs operate under regulatory scrutiny and zero tolerance for missed deadlines. The role demands equal fluency in technical architecture (understanding what engineers are building) and organizational orchestration (managing dependencies across 5-10 teams simultaneously). Compensation includes Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs vesting over four years, tied to the parent company's enterprise value. Technical Program Managers are the execution architects of institutional-grade stablecoins, ensuring that FIDD's ambitious product roadmap translates into shipped, compliant, production-quality infrastructure.

#### Level Mapping

| Fidelity Digital Assets | Coinbase | Galaxy Digital | BitGo | Circle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Technical Program Manager (DA-TPM1) | TPM (L5) | Program Manager | Technical Program Manager | Technical Program Manager |
| Senior Technical Program Manager (DA-TPM2) | Senior TPM (L6) | Senior PM | Senior TPM | Senior Technical Program Manager |

Fidelity DA-TPM1 maps to Coinbase TPM L5 and Circle Technical Program Manager. DA-TPM2 aligns with Coinbase Senior TPM L6 and is the primary level for TPMs owning an entire program area (e.g., FIDD platform launch, custody platform migration, or regulatory compliance program).

#### Fidelity Digital Dollar — The Institutional Stablecoin Architect

In February 2026, Fidelity launched the **Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)** — a regulated, institutional-grade stablecoin fully backed by US Treasury securities. FIDD is Fidelity's flagship digital asset product, designed for institutional settlement, cross-border treasury operations, and on-chain capital markets infrastructure.

As a Technical Program Manager on the FIDD platform, you drive execution across the entire stablecoin ecosystem:

- **Cross-Functional Program Execution:** Orchestrating the delivery of FIDD platform features across 5-10 engineering teams, product management, compliance, legal, operations, and institutional sales. You own the master program plan that transforms FIDD's product vision into production reality.
- **Regulatory Milestone Management:** Managing the intersection of engineering delivery timelines and regulatory approval milestones. In stablecoin operations, a missed regulatory deadline can delay an entire product launch — you ensure engineering and compliance workstreams remain synchronized.
- **Launch Coordination:** Leading the end-to-end launch coordination for new FIDD capabilities — multi-chain support, new institutional integrations, reserve attestation features — managing technical readiness, compliance sign-off, communications, and client enablement.
- **Dependency & Risk Management:** Identifying and mitigating cross-team dependencies and program risks that could delay FIDD delivery. This includes managing dependencies with Fidelity's core technology platform, external blockchain partners, and regulatory bodies.
- **Post-Launch Operations:** Driving the transition from development to steady-state operations for new FIDD features, including runbook creation, SLA definition, and operational readiness reviews.

Key negotiation framing:

- **"I'm the execution leader who ensures Fidelity's stablecoin vision becomes production reality — on time, within regulatory constraints, across a dozen cross-functional teams."** This positions the TPM role as the critical path to FIDD's success.
- **Regulatory program expertise:** TPMs who can manage the dual complexity of engineering delivery and regulatory compliance timelines are exceptionally rare. This skill set commands a premium over standard tech TPM compensation.
- **Scale of coordination:** Managing a program like FIDD involves coordinating across engineering, product, compliance, legal, risk, operations, and institutional sales — a breadth of stakeholder management that few TPM roles require.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — The Program Complexity Premium:**
   > "The FIDD TPM role manages one of the most complex programs in institutional digital assets — coordinating engineering delivery across multiple teams while synchronizing with regulatory approval milestones, institutional client onboarding timelines, and multi-chain deployment schedules. Coinbase Senior TPM compensation ranges from $280K-$370K TC. Given the program complexity and regulatory dimensions of FIDD, I'd expect compensation in the $270K-$330K range."

2. **Lever 2 — The Regulatory Execution Expertise:**
   > "My background managing programs at the intersection of engineering and regulatory compliance at [Previous Financial Institution] directly transfers to FIDD. I've successfully delivered [X programs] that required synchronized engineering delivery and regulatory approval — a skill set that's critical for FIDD's continued regulatory compliance. I'd like the comp to reflect this specialized execution capability."

3. **Lever 3 — The RSU Growth Thesis:**
   > "Fidelity Profit-Based RSUs are compelling for a TPM because my execution capability directly determines the velocity of FIDD feature delivery and institutional client onboarding — both key drivers of platform growth and Fidelity's enterprise value. I'd like to explore a larger initial RSU grant — in the $265K-$288K range over 4 years — to align my compensation with the delivery impact I'll drive."

4. **Lever 4 — The Competing Offer Anchor:**
   > "I have a competing offer from [Google / Coinbase / Stripe] at $[X] total comp for a comparable TPM role. I'm prioritizing Fidelity because of the FIDD mission and the unique challenge of managing institutional stablecoin program execution, but I need the total package to be within 10-15% of my best offer. A signing bonus of $40K-$60K would close the Year 1 gap."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $222K base and $268K RSUs ($67K/yr vest). If the initial offer comes in at $178K base, counter with: "Based on Levels.fyi data for technical program managers at crypto and financial services firms in Boston, my competing offer from Coinbase ($340K TC) for a Senior TPM role, and the exceptional program complexity of driving FIDD platform delivery across engineering, compliance, and institutional client workstreams, I'd like to target $218K base, $258K RSUs, a 25% bonus target, and a $50K signing bonus for a total first-year comp of approximately $335K. I'm prepared to accept at $200K+ base and $228K+ RSUs as a floor."
