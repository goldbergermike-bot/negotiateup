### ML/AI Engineer — Sophos Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers at Sophos build the deep learning and machine learning systems that power Intercept X's threat detection, making Sophos a pioneer in applying AI to endpoint security at scale across 100 million protected users.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | US Remote (USD) | Abingdon UK (GBP) | Vancouver (CAD) |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $150,000–$208,000 | £55,000–£80,000 | C$118,000–C$165,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $205,000–$268,000 | £78,000–£108,000 | C$163,000–C$218,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $263,000–$340,000 | £103,000–£143,000 | C$213,000–C$280,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, equity (phantom equity under Thoma Bravo), and performance bonus (10%). ML/AI roles command a 5-10% premium over general SWE.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Sophos

Sophos was one of the first cybersecurity companies to deploy deep learning models for endpoint threat detection, and ML/AI Engineers are central to maintaining this technological edge. Intercept X uses deep learning for malware detection, behavioral analysis for post-execution threat identification, and ML for URL filtering. Under Thoma Bravo ($3.9B), Sophos continues investing in AI to maintain detection leadership.

#### Sophos Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | ML Engineer | 2–5 years |
| L5 | Senior ML Engineer | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff ML Engineer | 8–12 years |

#### Lever 1: Deep Learning Pioneer in Security

"Sophos pioneered deep learning in endpoint security. I bring expertise in training and deploying deep learning models for classification tasks — the core ML challenge behind Intercept X's detection engine."

#### Lever 2: Edge ML Deployment

"Endpoint-deployed ML models must be efficient. My expertise in model optimization, quantization, and edge deployment ensures models achieve high accuracy within endpoint resource constraints."

#### Lever 3: Adversarial Robustness

"Threat actors attempt to evade ML detection. My experience in adversarial ML, model hardening, and evasion-resistant architectures strengthens Sophos's detection resilience."

#### Lever 4: ML Talent Scarcity

"ML engineers with security domain experience are exceptionally rare. I'm evaluating opportunities at multiple companies, and Sophos's offer must reflect the ML talent premium plus security specialization."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $173,000 base (US) with equity valued at $50K-$70K/year. Accept-at floor: $228,000 total comp. Leverage deep learning expertise and Sophos's pioneering ML reputation.
