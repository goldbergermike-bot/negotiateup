#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Sophos

Under Thoma Bravo ($3.9B), maintaining impeccable security posture is non-negotiable.

#### Lever 1: Securing the Security Company

#### Lever 2: Product Security

"I ensure Sophos's products meet the rigorous security standards customers expect from a security vendor. My application security expertise prevents vulnerabilities that could be exploited in customer environments."
