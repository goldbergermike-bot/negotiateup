#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Sophos

Staff Software Engineers at Sophos operate at the highest IC levels, defining architecture and technical strategy across the product portfolio. The Synchronized Security approach — real-time threat intelligence sharing between endpoint and network products — requires Staff-level architects who can design cross-product systems at scale.

Under Thoma Bravo's $3.9B ownership, Staff engineers are expected to drive platform efficiency and technical innovation that increases Sophos's competitive position and supports a potential exit.

#### Sophos Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L6 | Staff Software Engineer | 8–12 years |
| L7 | Principal Software Engineer | 12+ years |

#### Lever 1: Cross-Product Architecture

"Sophos's Synchronized Security requires architects who understand both endpoint and network security at a deep level. I bring cross-domain expertise that enables me to design systems spanning Intercept X, Sophos Firewall, and Sophos Central."

#### Lever 2: Platform Scalability Strategy

"As Staff engineer, I'll define the scalability strategy for Sophos Central as it grows beyond 500,000 managed organizations. My experience scaling multi-tenant platforms provides immediate impact."

#### Lever 3: Exit-Ready Technical Foundation

"Staff engineers under Thoma Bravo ownership build the technical foundation that drives valuation. My architectural decisions directly impact platform efficiency, scalability, and the technical due diligence of any future exit."

#### Lever 4: Staff-Level Market Competition

"I'm evaluating Staff-level offers at public cybersecurity companies. Sophos's private equity structure means I need compensation that accounts for the illiquidity of equity through either higher base or larger equity grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $200,000 base (US) with equity valued at $70K-$95K/year. Accept-at floor: $280,000 total comp. Leverage competing public-company offers and cross-product architectural scope.
