#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Sophos

SAs at Sophos work at the intersection of technical depth and customer engagement. Sophos's Synchronized Security architecture — where endpoints and firewalls share threat intelligence — requires SAs who understand both product domains and can design integrated deployments. The channel-driven sales model means SAs also enable MSP partners.

#### Lever 1: Synchronized Security Deployment

#### Lever 2: Channel and MSP Enablement

"Sophos's channel-driven model means SAs enable MSP partners. My ability to train and support partners amplifies Sophos's market reach without proportional headcount growth."

#### Lever 3: Multi-Product Architecture

"I design integrated security architectures spanning Intercept X, Sophos Firewall, Sophos MDR, and Sophos Central — driving multi-product adoption and increasing account value."

#### Lever 4: Enterprise Deal Support

"My technical credibility in enterprise sales cycles directly enables larger deals. I ensure successful deployments that drive renewal and expansion."
