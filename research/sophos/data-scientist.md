#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Sophos

Sophos pioneered the use of deep learning in endpoint security with Intercept X. Data Scientists build and refine the deep learning models that classify malware, detect exploits, and identify anomalous behavior across one of the largest endpoint security datasets in the industry. Under Thoma Bravo ($3.9B), Sophos invests in ML to maintain detection accuracy leadership.

#### Sophos Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Data Scientist | 2–5 years |
| L5 | Senior Data Scientist | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff / Principal Data Scientist | 8–14 years |

#### Lever 1: Deep Learning for Threat Detection

"Sophos was a pioneer in applying deep learning to endpoint security. I bring expertise in training and deploying deep learning models that must operate with extremely high accuracy and minimal false positives at endpoint scale."

#### Lever 2: Malware Classification Expertise

"My experience in malware classification — feature engineering from PE files, behavioral sequences, and network indicators — directly supports Intercept X's detection engine evolution."

#### Lever 3: Model Efficiency for Endpoint Deployment

"Endpoint-deployed models must be efficient in memory and compute. I specialize in model compression and optimization techniques that maintain accuracy while meeting the resource constraints of endpoint deployment."

#### Lever 4: Adversarial ML Robustness

"Threat actors actively attempt to evade ML detection. My experience in adversarial machine learning and model robustness ensures Sophos's detection models remain effective against evasion techniques."
