### Endpoint Defense Engineer — Sophos Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Endpoint Defense Engineers at Sophos build the detection, prevention, and response capabilities of Intercept X — Sophos's flagship endpoint security product that protects over 100 million users with deep learning threat detection, anti-ransomware, and exploit prevention.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | US Remote (USD) | Abingdon UK (GBP) | Vancouver (CAD) |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $145,000–$200,000 | £53,000–£75,000 | C$115,000–C$160,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $198,000–$260,000 | £73,000–£103,000 | C$155,000–C$210,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $255,000–$330,000 | £100,000–£138,000 | C$208,000–C$275,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, equity (phantom equity / profit-sharing units under Thoma Bravo ownership, 4-year vest), and performance bonus (typically 10%). Endpoint Defense roles command a 5-8% premium over general SWE due to specialized threat detection and low-level systems expertise.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Sophos

This is the signature engineering role at Sophos. Endpoint Defense Engineers build the detection engines, behavioral analysis systems, and response capabilities that make Intercept X a market-leading endpoint security product. The role requires deep expertise in Windows and Linux internals, malware analysis, detection engineering, and low-level systems programming — skills that are rare and highly specialized.

Sophos (private, Thoma Bravo, $3.9B acquisition) is headquartered in Abingdon, UK. Intercept X uses deep learning models for threat detection, CryptoGuard for anti-ransomware protection, and exploit prevention technology. The product consistently achieves top scores in independent testing by SE Labs, AV-TEST, and AV-Comparatives.

Engineers in this role work at the intersection of systems programming, security research, and machine learning — building detection capabilities that must stop advanced threats while running efficiently on diverse endpoints. This combination of skills is exceptionally rare.

#### Sophos Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3 | Endpoint Defense Engineer | 1–3 years |
| L4 | Endpoint Defense Engineer II | 3–5 years |
| L5 | Senior Endpoint Defense Engineer | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff Endpoint Defense Engineer | 8–12 years |
| L7 | Principal Endpoint Defense Engineer | 12+ years |

#### Lever 1: Intercept X Deep Learning Detection

"Intercept X's deep learning detection engine is a core competitive differentiator. I bring expertise in building efficient ML inference engines for endpoint deployment, where models must detect threats with minimal resource consumption and zero impact on system performance."

#### Lever 2: Anti-Ransomware & CryptoGuard

"Ransomware is the most costly cyber threat facing organizations. My experience in behavioral detection and file system monitoring directly supports CryptoGuard's ability to detect and roll back ransomware encryption in real time — protecting organizations from the most financially devastating attacks."

#### Lever 3: Exploit Prevention & OS Internals

"Endpoint defense requires deep knowledge of OS internals, exploit techniques, and mitigation strategies. I bring expertise in Windows and Linux kernel internals, memory protection, and exploit detection that strengthens Intercept X's ability to prevent zero-day exploits."

#### Lever 4: Synchronized Security Integration

"Sophos's Synchronized Security enables endpoints to communicate threat intelligence to firewalls in real time. I bring experience building cross-system communication protocols that support this unique competitive capability, enabling automated response across endpoint and network layers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $170,000 base (US) with equity valued at $45K-$65K/year. Accept-at floor: $220,000 total comp. Cite the extreme specialization of endpoint defense engineering and Intercept X's market-leading test scores.
