#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Sophos

Sophos is a global cybersecurity leader headquartered in Abingdon, UK, acquired by Thoma Bravo in a $3.9 billion take-private deal in 2020. The company protects over 500,000 organizations with its portfolio of endpoint security (Intercept X), next-gen firewalls (Sophos Firewall/XGS), and managed detection and response (Sophos MDR). Sophos is notable for its Synchronized Security approach, where endpoint and network products share threat intelligence in real time.

Software Engineers at Sophos work on products deployed across a massive and diverse customer base, from small businesses to large enterprises. The engineering challenge includes building detection engines, firewall rule processing systems, cloud management consoles, and the Sophos Central unified management platform.

Sophos competes for talent against both UK-based tech companies and US cybersecurity firms offering remote positions. For US-based roles, compensation is competitive with mid-tier cybersecurity companies. UK-based roles should be benchmarked against UK cybersecurity leaders and London tech companies.

#### Lever 1: Endpoint Security Market Position

"Sophos Intercept X is consistently top-rated in independent endpoint security tests. I bring experience building detection and response systems that maintain this standard of excellence across millions of endpoints."

#### Lever 2: Synchronized Security Architecture

"Sophos's Synchronized Security approach — where endpoints and firewalls share threat intelligence in real time — is a unique competitive advantage. My experience building distributed security systems that communicate across product boundaries directly supports this architecture."

#### Lever 3: Sophos Central Cloud Platform

"Sophos Central is the cloud management platform that unifies all Sophos products. My experience building multi-tenant SaaS platforms supports the continued modernization and scaling of Sophos Central for over 500,000 customer organizations."

#### Lever 4: Thoma Bravo Growth Investment

"Thoma Bravo's $3.9B acquisition of Sophos signals significant growth investment. I'm joining at a pivotal moment where engineering velocity directly impacts the company's trajectory toward a potential exit or IPO."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $165,000 base (US) with equity valued at $40K-$60K/year. Accept-at floor: $205,000 total comp. Cite Thoma Bravo's investment and Sophos's market-leading endpoint and firewall products.
