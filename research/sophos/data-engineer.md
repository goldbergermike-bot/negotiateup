#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Sophos

Data Engineers at Sophos process telemetry from one of the largest endpoint security deployments in the world. This data powers everything from deep learning model training to the Sophos Central analytics dashboard to the threat intelligence feeds that Sophos MDR analysts use to detect threats across customer environments.

Under Thoma Bravo's $3.9B ownership, Sophos invests in data infrastructure to improve detection accuracy and enable new data-driven products. Data Engineers who can build reliable pipelines at this scale have strong leverage.

#### Sophos Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Data Engineer | 2–6 years |
| L5 | Senior Data Engineer | 6–10 years |
| L6 | Staff / Principal Data Engineer | 10–15 years |

#### Lever 1: Endpoint Telemetry at Scale

"Sophos processes telemetry from over 100 million endpoints. My experience building data pipelines at comparable scale maps directly to this challenge."

#### Lever 2: ML Training Pipeline Infrastructure

"Sophos's deep learning detection models require high-quality training data. I build the data pipelines that prepare, clean, and deliver training data at scale — directly impacting detection model accuracy."

#### Lever 3: Sophos MDR Data Infrastructure

"Sophos MDR requires real-time data infrastructure for threat hunters and analysts. My experience building low-latency analytical systems supports the MDR team's ability to detect and respond to threats quickly."

#### Lever 4: Cross-Product Data Unification

"Sophos's Synchronized Security generates data across endpoints and networks. I bring expertise in unifying diverse data sources into coherent analytical views that power cross-product intelligence."
