#### Negotiation DNA

BlackRock Software Engineers operate at the intersection of financial technology and global asset management. With $11.5 trillion in assets under management, every line of code you write directly impacts the world's largest investment platform. As a publicly traded company (NYSE: BLK), BlackRock offers a compensation structure that blends traditional finance bonuses with competitive tech RSU packages. Candidates should position themselves as builders of critical infrastructure that powers Aladdin — the operating system for investment managers worldwide. The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme is driving unprecedented demand for engineers who can modernize BlackRock's technology stack, making this a prime window to negotiate for "Active Alpha" premiums that reflect your direct contribution to platform revenue.

#### Aladdin AI — The Active Alpha Premium

BlackRock is deploying Aladdin AI across its entire $11.5T+ AUM ecosystem, creating the most consequential AI transformation in financial services. As a Software Engineer, your work touches Aladdin's foundational infrastructure — the platform that 200+ external institutions pay to access, generating over $1.5B in annual technology revenue.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**
- Aladdin AI is being embedded into portfolio construction, risk analytics, and trading workflows — your code directly enables these capabilities
- The $5-8 trillion global AI capex theme means BlackRock is competing with FAANG, quant funds, and AI startups for engineering talent
- Engineers who can articulate how their skills accelerate Aladdin AI adoption command a **10-15% premium** over standard offers
- Frame your value as: "I'm not just building software — I'm building the AI-powered operating system for global capital markets"

**Leverage language:** "Given that Aladdin AI is BlackRock's strategic priority and my experience in [distributed systems / ML infrastructure / cloud-native development] directly accelerates that roadmap, I'd expect compensation reflecting the Active Alpha premium that Aladdin-aligned engineers command."

#### Global Levers

1. **The Aladdin Infrastructure Lever:** "My experience building [scalable distributed systems / cloud-native platforms] maps directly to Aladdin's evolution toward AI-native architecture. I understand the $5-8 trillion AI capex theme is driving BlackRock's infrastructure investment, and I want my compensation to reflect my ability to accelerate that transformation."

2. **The Competing Offer Lever:** "I have a competing offer from [Goldman Sachs Engineering / Citadel / Two Sigma / Google Cloud] at $X total comp. I prefer BlackRock's mission and Aladdin's platform scale, but the delta needs to be bridgeable. Can we close the gap with a signing bonus or accelerated RSU vesting?"

3. **The Revenue Impact Lever:** "Aladdin Technology generates over $1.5 billion in annual revenue for BlackRock. As an engineer contributing to this platform, my work has direct revenue attribution — I'd like my compensation to reflect that impact rather than generic market rates."

4. **The Retention Lever:** "I'm evaluating long-term career trajectory. If BlackRock can structure a competitive Year 1 package with meaningful equity upside and a clear path to the VP band within 18-24 months, I'll commit to declining other active processes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target the top of the range at $175K base with $50K/yr in RSUs. If your initial offer comes in at $140K-$150K base, counter at $170K and cite competing offers from Goldman Sachs Engineering ($165K base) or Two Sigma ($180K base). Push for a $25K-$40K signing bonus to bridge the Year 1 gap. On RSUs, request a front-loaded vesting schedule (40/30/20/10 vs. standard 25/25/25/25). Accept at $160K+ base and $35K+ annual RSUs as your floor — anything below signals BlackRock isn't pricing you at the Aladdin-competitive rate.
