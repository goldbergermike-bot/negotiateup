#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at BlackRock are the operational backbone of the world's most critical financial technology platform. With $11.5 trillion in AUM and Aladdin processing risk analytics for $21T+ in total assets, every deployment pipeline, infrastructure automation, and reliability improvement you deliver has direct consequences for global financial stability. BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) operates Aladdin as both an internal platform and an external product serving 200+ institutional clients — meaning your DevOps work must meet the availability, security, and compliance standards of regulated financial infrastructure at planetary scale. The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme is driving massive infrastructure transformation at BlackRock, including cloud migration, Kubernetes orchestration, and ML pipeline automation — all of which sit squarely in the DevOps domain. Candidates should negotiate for "Active Alpha" premiums by positioning themselves as the engineers who ensure Aladdin AI's capabilities are delivered reliably, securely, and at scale. DevOps engineers with experience in financial services compliance, multi-cloud architecture, and ML infrastructure automation are in exceptional demand.

#### Aladdin AI — The Active Alpha Premium

BlackRock is deploying Aladdin AI across its entire $11.5T+ AUM ecosystem, and DevOps Engineers are the infrastructure layer that determines whether AI capabilities reach production reliably and at scale. Without robust CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and observability infrastructure, Aladdin AI's most sophisticated models remain research experiments rather than production capabilities.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**
- DevOps engineers who build and maintain Aladdin AI's production infrastructure command a **10-15% premium** over standard VP-band offers — you are the reliability guarantee for BlackRock's highest-priority initiative
- Aladdin's uptime directly impacts $21T+ in managed assets; a single production incident can have regulatory, financial, and reputational consequences measured in billions
- The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme is driving BlackRock's migration to cloud-native, Kubernetes-orchestrated ML infrastructure — your skills are the enabler
- BlackRock competes with Google SRE, Amazon infrastructure, and quant fund platform teams for DevOps talent — your alternative offers carry real weight

**Leverage language:** "As a DevOps Engineer building Aladdin AI's production infrastructure, I'm the reliability layer that determines whether BlackRock's most strategic AI investment actually reaches production at scale. My experience in [Kubernetes orchestration / ML pipeline automation / cloud-native infrastructure / financial services compliance] directly enables Aladdin AI's deployment velocity. I expect an Active Alpha premium that reflects the operational criticality of this role."

#### Global Levers

1. **The Operational Criticality Lever:** "Aladdin processes risk analytics for $21T+ in assets with uptime requirements that exceed most tech companies. A single hour of downtime has consequences measured in millions. My DevOps expertise ensures this platform operates at the reliability standard BlackRock's clients demand. I'm targeting $210K+ base with $75K+/yr in RSUs."

2. **The Cloud Transformation Lever:** "BlackRock's cloud migration and AI infrastructure modernization is a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar initiative. I bring deep experience in [AWS/Azure/GCP infrastructure / Kubernetes at scale / infrastructure-as-code] that directly accelerates this transformation. I have a competing offer from [Google SRE / Amazon Infrastructure / Citadel Platform] at $X total comp — I need BlackRock to be competitive."

3. **The ML Infrastructure Lever:** "AI models are only as good as the infrastructure that serves them. My experience building ML serving infrastructure, feature stores, and model monitoring pipelines is exactly what Aladdin AI needs to move from prototype to production. This ML-DevOps intersection is exceptionally scarce, and I'd like my compensation to reflect that."

4. **The Compliance & Security Lever:** "Financial services DevOps requires a level of compliance rigor — SOC 2, SOX, regulatory auditing — that pure tech companies don't face. My experience navigating this regulatory landscape while maintaining deployment velocity is a premium capability. If BlackRock can structure a package with Director-track progression and a $30K-$45K signing bonus, I'll commit exclusively."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $210K-$215K base with $75K-$85K/yr in RSUs. If the initial offer comes in at $165K-$180K base, counter at $205K and cite competing offers from Google SRE L5 ($195K base, $85K/yr RSU) or Amazon Infrastructure ($190K base, $75K/yr RSU). Push for a $25K-$40K signing bonus to bridge the Year 1 gap. On equity, request $310K-$340K in 4-year RSUs with annual refresh potential. Accept at $195K+ base and $60K+ annual RSUs as your floor — below this, BlackRock is underpricing the DevOps role given Aladdin's operational criticality and the infrastructure demands of Aladdin AI deployment.
