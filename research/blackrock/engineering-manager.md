#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at BlackRock own the delivery, retention, and technical growth of engineering teams building the most critical financial technology platform in the world. With $11.5 trillion in AUM, your team's output directly drives Aladdin's capabilities across portfolio management, risk analytics, and trading infrastructure. BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) structures EM compensation at the Director band, blending traditional finance bonus culture with technology-competitive RSU packages. The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme has created an unprecedented need for engineering leaders who can recruit, retain, and direct top-tier AI and platform talent — making this one of the hardest roles for BlackRock to fill. As an EM, you are negotiating for an "Active Alpha" premium that reflects not only your individual contribution but your multiplier effect across an entire team building Aladdin AI capabilities. Candidates should emphasize their ability to scale engineering organizations, reduce attrition in competitive talent markets, and accelerate Aladdin delivery timelines.

#### Aladdin AI — The Active Alpha Premium

BlackRock is deploying Aladdin AI across its entire $11.5T+ AUM ecosystem, and Engineering Managers are the force multipliers who translate AI strategy into shipped product. Your team builds, maintains, and scales the AI infrastructure that 200+ institutional clients depend on — representing $1.5B+ in annual Aladdin technology revenue.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**
- Engineering Managers who lead Aladdin AI teams command a **12-20% premium** over standard Director-band offers — BlackRock cannot afford leadership gaps on its highest-priority platform initiative
- Your ability to recruit and retain AI/ML engineers in a hyper-competitive market is worth more than any individual contributor's output — quantify this as your multiplier effect
- The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme means every quarter of delayed Aladdin AI delivery costs BlackRock competitive positioning against Bloomberg, MSCI, and emerging fintech platforms
- BlackRock's engineering attrition at the manager level directly correlates to team velocity — your retention track record is a negotiation asset

**Leverage language:** "As an Engineering Manager leading Aladdin AI teams, I'm not just managing engineers — I'm the multiplier that determines whether BlackRock's most strategic technology investment delivers on time and at scale. My track record of [building high-performing teams / reducing attrition / shipping complex platform features] directly impacts Aladdin AI's competitive timeline. I expect an Active Alpha premium that reflects this leadership multiplier."

#### Global Levers

1. **The Team Multiplier Lever:** "An Engineering Manager's value is measured by team output, not individual commits. I've consistently built teams that ship 2-3x faster than industry benchmarks. At BlackRock's scale, that multiplier effect on Aladdin AI delivery is worth tens of millions in accelerated revenue capture. I'm targeting $265K+ base with $110K+/yr in RSUs."

2. **The Talent War Lever:** "BlackRock is competing with Google, Meta, Citadel, and Two Sigma for the same AI engineering talent. My ability to recruit and retain top engineers in this market is the single highest-leverage capability for Aladdin AI delivery. I have a competing offer from [Google EM / Meta EM / Citadel Engineering Lead] at $X total comp — I need BlackRock to be within striking distance."

3. **The Aladdin Delivery Risk Lever:** "Every month of engineering leadership vacancy on an Aladdin AI team costs BlackRock in delayed product launches, client dissatisfaction, and competitive positioning. The cost of an extended EM search at this level exceeds $500K in recruiting fees and lost velocity. My compensation should reflect the risk mitigation I provide by filling this critical role."

4. **The MD-Track Commitment Lever:** "I'm evaluating this as a 5+ year leadership platform. If BlackRock can structure a package with Managing Director trajectory, a $60K-$80K signing bonus, meaningful Year 1 RSUs, and a guaranteed compensation review at 18 months tied to Aladdin AI milestones, I'll commit fully and withdraw from all competing processes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $270K-$275K base with $110K-$120K/yr in RSUs. If the initial offer comes in at $215K-$235K base, counter at $260K and cite competing offers from Google Engineering Manager ($255K base, $130K/yr RSU) or Goldman Sachs ED ($250K base, 50%+ bonus). Push for a $50K-$75K signing bonus — EM-level hires routinely receive signing bonuses to offset Year 1 equity cliff. On equity, request $440K-$480K in 4-year RSUs with guaranteed annual refresh grants of $60K-$100K. Accept at $250K+ base and $90K+ annual RSUs as your floor — below this, BlackRock is not pricing the EM role competitively against FAANG and top-tier quant fund leadership positions.
