#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at BlackRock orchestrate the most complex technology programs in financial services — coordinating cross-functional engineering teams, managing multi-year platform initiatives, and ensuring that Aladdin's evolution stays on track across $11.5 trillion in AUM. Unlike TPMs at consumer tech companies who manage feature releases, BlackRock TPMs manage programs where delays and failures have consequences for global financial infrastructure. BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) positions senior TPMs at the Director band, reflecting the strategic importance of program execution for Aladdin's competitive positioning. The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme has created an entirely new category of TPM programs — Aladdin AI deployment, cloud migration, ML platform integration — that require leaders who understand both the technical complexity and the regulatory constraints of financial technology. Candidates should negotiate for "Active Alpha" premiums by framing their program leadership as the execution guarantee for BlackRock's most strategic and revenue-critical technology investments. TPMs who can manage AI program complexity while navigating financial services compliance are in extreme demand.

#### Aladdin AI — The Active Alpha Premium

BlackRock is deploying Aladdin AI across its entire $11.5T+ AUM ecosystem, and Technical Program Managers are the execution layer that determines whether AI strategy becomes delivered product. Your program leadership orchestrates the coordination between data scientists, ML engineers, platform engineers, product managers, and compliance teams — without this orchestration, Aladdin AI's most ambitious initiatives stall in cross-functional complexity.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**
- TPMs who lead Aladdin AI programs command a **12-18% premium** over standard Director-band offers — you are the execution guarantee for BlackRock's highest-priority investment
- Every quarter of delayed Aladdin AI delivery costs BlackRock competitive positioning, client satisfaction, and incremental technology revenue measured in tens of millions
- The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme means Aladdin AI programs span cloud infrastructure, ML platforms, data pipelines, and regulatory compliance — the coordination complexity demands premium TPM talent
- BlackRock competes with Google TPM, Amazon TPM, and top financial services firms for program leaders who understand AI technology delivery in regulated environments

**Leverage language:** "As a Technical Program Manager leading Aladdin AI programs, I'm the execution guarantee for BlackRock's most strategic technology investment. My track record of [delivering complex platform programs / managing AI/ML program lifecycles / coordinating cross-functional engineering teams at scale] directly determines whether Aladdin AI ships on time and at quality. I expect an Active Alpha premium that reflects this execution-critical leadership."

#### Global Levers

1. **The Execution Guarantee Lever:** "Aladdin AI is BlackRock's most strategic technology investment, and the cost of delayed execution is measured in lost revenue and competitive positioning. My program leadership track record — [delivered $XM platform initiative / managed N-team coordination / shipped AI features on schedule] — provides the execution guarantee BlackRock needs. I'm targeting $228K+ base with $80K+/yr in RSUs."

2. **The FAANG TPM Lever:** "I have a competing offer from [Google TPM / Amazon TPM / Meta TPM] at $X total comp. BlackRock's Aladdin AI programs are the most consequential technology programs in financial services, but the compensation needs to reflect that stakes and complexity. Can we bridge with enhanced RSUs or a $35K-$50K signing bonus?"

3. **The Regulatory Complexity Lever:** "Managing AI programs in financial services requires navigating regulatory constraints — model risk governance, SOX compliance, data privacy regulations — that pure tech TPMs never face. My experience delivering complex programs within these constraints is a premium capability that reduces BlackRock's execution risk. I believe a 15% premium over the initial offer is justified."

4. **The MD-Track Lever:** "I'm evaluating this opportunity as a multi-year leadership platform. If BlackRock can structure a package with Managing Director trajectory, a $35K-$50K signing bonus, scope that grows with Aladdin AI's program portfolio, and a guaranteed compensation review at 18 months, I'll commit to declining all competing processes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $228K-$232K base with $80K-$87K/yr in RSUs. If the initial offer lands at $178K-$195K base, counter at $225K and cite competing offers from Google TPM L6 ($220K base, $90K/yr RSU) or Amazon Principal TPM ($215K base, $85K/yr RSU). Push for a $35K-$50K signing bonus to close the Year 1 gap. On equity, request $320K-$348K in 4-year RSUs with annual refresh potential. Accept at $210K+ base and $65K+ annual RSUs as your floor — below this, BlackRock is not pricing TPM leadership competitively against FAANG programs and the execution stakes of Aladdin AI delivery.
