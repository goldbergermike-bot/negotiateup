#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at BlackRock build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers the most consequential investment decisions in global finance. With $11.5 trillion in AUM and Aladdin processing analytics for $21T+ in total assets, your data pipelines, warehouses, and transformation layers are the foundation upon which every portfolio decision, risk model, and AI capability is built. BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) manages one of the most complex data ecosystems in any industry — ingesting market data feeds from hundreds of sources, processing millions of positions across every asset class, and delivering real-time analytics to portfolio managers and institutional clients worldwide. The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme has elevated data engineering from infrastructure work to strategic capability — Aladdin AI's models are only as powerful as the data infrastructure that feeds them. Candidates should negotiate for "Active Alpha" premiums by framing their data engineering work as the enablement layer for BlackRock's entire AI strategy. Data engineers who combine experience in financial data modeling, real-time streaming architectures, and ML feature engineering are exceptionally scarce and command premium compensation.

#### Aladdin AI — The Active Alpha Premium

BlackRock is deploying Aladdin AI across its entire $11.5T+ AUM ecosystem, and Data Engineers are the foundation builders who make this AI transformation possible. Every ML model, every predictive risk algorithm, every natural language portfolio query depends on the data infrastructure you build — clean, timely, and reliable data pipelines that transform raw market signals into AI-ready feature sets.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**
- Data Engineers who build Aladdin AI's data infrastructure command a **10-15% premium** over standard VP-band offers — you are the enablement layer without which BlackRock's AI strategy cannot function
- Aladdin ingests data from hundreds of market data providers, processes millions of positions across every asset class, and serves real-time analytics to 200+ institutional clients — the complexity is unmatched
- BlackRock's $1.5B+ Aladdin technology revenue depends on data quality, timeliness, and reliability — your infrastructure work is the foundation of product quality
- The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme means data engineering has moved from cost center to strategic capability — ML feature stores, real-time streaming, and data mesh architectures are now executive priorities

**Leverage language:** "As a Data Engineer building Aladdin AI's data infrastructure, I'm the foundation that enables every ML model, risk algorithm, and AI capability on the platform. My experience in [real-time data pipelines / financial data modeling / ML feature engineering / distributed data systems] directly determines the quality of Aladdin AI's outputs across $21T+ in managed assets. I expect an Active Alpha premium that reflects this foundational impact."

#### Global Levers

1. **The Data Foundation Lever:** "AI is only as good as its data. At BlackRock's scale — processing analytics for $21T+ in assets across every asset class — the data engineering challenge is one of the most complex in any industry. My infrastructure work determines whether Aladdin AI's models produce reliable insights or garbage. I'm targeting $222K+ base with $82K+/yr in RSUs to reflect this foundational responsibility."

2. **The Data Infrastructure Lever:** "I have competing offers from [Databricks / Snowflake / Google Data Engineering / Meta Data Infrastructure] at $X total comp. BlackRock's data complexity is uniquely compelling, but the compensation needs to match the market for senior data engineers who can work at financial-data scale. Can we bridge with enhanced RSUs or a $25K-$40K signing bonus?"

3. **The ML Feature Engineering Lever:** "Data Engineers who can build ML feature stores, real-time feature pipelines, and data mesh architectures for financial AI models are the scarcest talent in the market. My experience at the intersection of data engineering and ML infrastructure is exactly what Aladdin AI needs to accelerate model deployment. This specialization warrants a 12-15% premium over the initial offer."

4. **The Director-Track Lever:** "I'm evaluating this opportunity on a 3-5 year trajectory. If BlackRock can structure a package with Director-track progression, a $30K-$45K signing bonus, meaningful Year 1 RSUs, and scope to define Aladdin AI's data architecture strategy, I'll commit to declining my other active processes."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $222K-$225K base with $82K-$90K/yr in RSUs. If the initial offer comes in at $172K-$190K base, counter at $218K and cite competing offers from Databricks Senior Data Engineer ($215K base, $85K/yr RSU) or Snowflake Staff Data Engineer ($210K base, $80K/yr RSU). Push for a $25K-$40K signing bonus to bridge the Year 1 gap. On equity, request $330K-$360K in 4-year RSUs with annual refresh potential. Accept at $205K+ base and $65K+ annual RSUs as your floor — below this, BlackRock is underpricing data engineering relative to the foundational role this function plays in Aladdin AI's success and the hyper-competitive market for senior data engineers.
