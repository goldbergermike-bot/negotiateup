#### Negotiation DNA

Product Managers at BlackRock define the roadmap for technology products that serve $11.5 trillion in assets under management and $21T+ in total assets on the Aladdin platform. Unlike consumer tech PMs, BlackRock Product Managers operate at the intersection of financial domain expertise and platform technology — translating the needs of portfolio managers, risk analysts, and institutional clients into product specifications that drive Aladdin's evolution. As a publicly traded company (NYSE: BLK), BlackRock's product decisions directly impact quarterly earnings through Aladdin Technology's $1.5B+ revenue stream. The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme has created a new category of PM roles focused on Aladdin AI product strategy, driving demand for candidates who can bridge AI/ML capabilities with financial workflows. Candidates should position themselves as revenue-driving product leaders who can capture the "Active Alpha" premium by demonstrating how their product vision accelerates Aladdin's market position.

#### Aladdin AI — The Active Alpha Premium

BlackRock is deploying Aladdin AI across its entire $11.5T+ AUM ecosystem, and Product Managers are the translators between AI capability and client value. Your product decisions determine which AI features reach 200+ institutional clients, how natural language portfolio queries are surfaced, and how predictive risk models are integrated into daily investment workflows.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**
- PMs who own Aladdin AI product lines command a **10-18% premium** over standard VP-band offers — these roles sit at the strategic intersection of BlackRock's highest-priority initiative and its largest revenue engine
- Your product decisions directly influence Aladdin's $1.5B+ technology revenue trajectory — each feature launch can unlock millions in incremental client adoption
- The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme means BlackRock is hiring PMs who understand AI product development cycles, not just traditional finance PMs — this specialization premium is real and quantifiable
- BlackRock competes with Google PM, Meta PM, and fintech product leaders for this talent — your alternative offers are your strongest lever

**Leverage language:** "As a Product Manager defining Aladdin AI's product strategy, I own the roadmap that determines how $21T+ in managed assets interact with AI capabilities. My experience in [AI/ML product development / enterprise platform products / financial technology products] positions me to accelerate Aladdin AI's market adoption. I expect an Active Alpha premium that reflects this product leadership impact."

#### Global Levers

1. **The Revenue Ownership Lever:** "Product Managers at BlackRock don't just ship features — we drive revenue. Aladdin Technology generates $1.5B+ annually, and my product decisions directly influence client adoption, retention, and upsell. I'm targeting $210K+ base with $75K+/yr in RSUs to reflect this revenue accountability."

2. **The AI Product Specialization Lever:** "PMs who understand both AI/ML product development and financial technology are exceptionally rare. I have a competing offer from [Google AI PM / Meta PM / Stripe PM] at $X total comp. BlackRock's Aladdin AI opportunity is uniquely compelling, but the compensation needs to be competitive with top tech PM benchmarks."

3. **The Client Impact Lever:** "My product decisions will be used by the world's largest institutional investors — sovereign wealth funds, central banks, and pension systems managing trillions in assets. The stakes of product quality at this level are orders of magnitude higher than consumer tech. I'd like my compensation to reflect the magnitude of client impact and fiduciary responsibility."

4. **The Director-Track Lever:** "I'm evaluating this role on a 3-5 year trajectory. If BlackRock can structure a package with Director-track progression, a $30K-$45K signing bonus, meaningful Year 1 RSUs, and a product leadership scope that grows with Aladdin AI's expansion, I'll commit to declining competing processes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $215K-$218K base with $80K-$85K/yr in RSUs. If the initial offer comes in at $170K-$185K base, counter at $210K and cite competing offers from Google PM L6 ($200K base, $95K/yr RSU) or Stripe PM ($195K base, $80K/yr RSU). Push for a $25K-$40K signing bonus to bridge the Year 1 equity gap. On equity, request $320K-$340K in 4-year RSUs with annual refresh potential. Accept at $195K+ base and $60K+ annual RSUs as your floor — below this, BlackRock is underpricing the PM role relative to the Aladdin AI product impact and competitive tech PM market.
