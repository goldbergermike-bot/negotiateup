#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at BlackRock operate at the epicenter of quantitative finance and AI — building the statistical models, machine learning systems, and analytical frameworks that power investment decisions across $11.5 trillion in AUM. Unlike data science roles at consumer tech companies, BlackRock data scientists work with the most consequential datasets in global finance: portfolio holdings, risk factors, market microstructure data, and macroeconomic signals that collectively represent $21T+ in assets on the Aladdin platform. BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) has publicly committed to embedding AI across every investment process, and the $5-8 trillion AI capex theme has accelerated hiring for data scientists who can bridge quantitative research with production ML systems. Candidates should negotiate for "Active Alpha" premiums by framing their work as directly generating investment alpha — the measurable outperformance that justifies BlackRock's management fees and drives AUM growth. Data scientists with experience in financial modeling, NLP for investment research, or risk analytics are in extreme demand across BlackRock, Citadel, Two Sigma, and FAANG applied science teams.

#### Aladdin AI — The Active Alpha Premium

BlackRock is deploying Aladdin AI across its entire $11.5T+ AUM ecosystem, and Data Scientists are the intellectual engine powering this transformation. Your models determine how AI-driven insights are generated — from natural language processing of earnings calls and research reports to predictive risk models that anticipate market dislocations before they occur.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**
- Data Scientists building Aladdin AI's analytical models command a **12-18% premium** over standard VP-band offers — your work has direct, measurable impact on investment performance and client outcomes
- Aladdin processes risk analytics for $21T+ in total assets; your models influence portfolio decisions at a scale no other platform matches
- BlackRock's $1.5B+ Aladdin technology revenue depends on the quality of its analytical capabilities — your work is the product
- The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme means BlackRock competes directly with Citadel, Two Sigma, D.E. Shaw, and Google DeepMind for quantitative talent — your alternative offers carry significant weight

**Leverage language:** "As a Data Scientist building Aladdin AI's analytical models, my work directly generates the investment insights that differentiate BlackRock's platform for 200+ institutional clients. My background in [statistical modeling / NLP for finance / risk analytics / time-series forecasting] maps precisely to Aladdin AI's highest-value capabilities. I expect an Active Alpha premium that reflects the direct alpha-generation potential of my work."

#### Global Levers

1. **The Alpha Generation Lever:** "My models don't just process data — they generate investment alpha. At BlackRock's scale, even a single basis point of improved risk-adjusted returns across $11.5T in AUM translates to hundreds of millions in value. My compensation should reflect the alpha-generation potential of my quantitative work, not generic data science market rates. I'm targeting $235K+ base with $95K+/yr in RSUs."

2. **The Quant Fund Competing Offer Lever:** "I'm currently in conversations with [Citadel / Two Sigma / D.E. Shaw / Jane Street] where total compensation for quantitative researchers at my level ranges from $350K-$500K+. I'm drawn to BlackRock's scale and Aladdin's platform impact, but the economics need to be competitive. Can we bridge with a performance-linked bonus structure or enhanced RSUs?"

3. **The Aladdin AI Model Ownership Lever:** "Data Scientists who own production models on a platform serving $21T+ in assets are extraordinarily rare. My experience in [building production ML systems / financial NLP / risk model development] positions me to own critical Aladdin AI model infrastructure. This level of responsibility and impact warrants a 15% premium over the initial offer."

4. **The Research-to-Production Lever:** "I bridge the gap between quantitative research and production systems — I don't just build models, I deploy them at scale. If BlackRock can structure a package with Director-track progression, a $40K-$55K signing bonus, and scope to define Aladdin AI's data science roadmap, I'll commit to declining my quant fund alternatives."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $235K-$240K base with $95K-$105K/yr in RSUs and a 30-40% bonus. If the initial offer lands at $185K-$200K base, counter at $230K and present competing offers from Citadel Research ($250K base, $200K+ bonus) or Two Sigma ($240K base, $180K+ bonus). Push for a $40K-$60K signing bonus to close the Year 1 gap. On equity, request $380K-$420K in 4-year RSUs with performance-linked refresh grants. Accept at $215K+ base and $75K+ annual RSUs as your floor — below this, BlackRock is losing this negotiation to quant funds that price quantitative talent at its true alpha-generation value.
