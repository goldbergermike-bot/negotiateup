#### Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at BlackRock shape the user experience for the most consequential financial technology platform in the world. With $11.5 trillion in assets under management, every design decision you make impacts how portfolio managers, risk analysts, and institutional investors interact with Aladdin — the platform processing risk analytics for $21T+ in total assets. BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) has historically underinvested in design relative to FAANG, but the Aladdin AI transformation is changing that calculus dramatically. The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme is driving unprecedented demand for designers who can translate complex AI capabilities into intuitive workflows — making natural language portfolio queries, predictive risk visualizations, and AI-generated insights accessible to non-technical investment professionals. Candidates should position themselves as the bridge between Aladdin AI's technical capability and its user adoption, negotiating for "Active Alpha" premiums that reflect the critical role design plays in Aladdin's revenue growth. Design talent with financial technology or enterprise AI experience commands a meaningful premium because this intersection is exceptionally rare.

#### Aladdin AI — The Active Alpha Premium

BlackRock is deploying Aladdin AI across its entire $11.5T+ AUM ecosystem, and Product Designers are the critical link between raw AI capability and user adoption. Without effective design, Aladdin AI's most powerful features — natural language portfolio queries, predictive risk dashboards, automated rebalancing interfaces — remain inaccessible to the investment professionals who need them.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**
- Designers who can translate AI/ML outputs into intuitive financial workflows command a **10-15% premium** over standard VP-band design offers — this capability is the bottleneck for Aladdin AI adoption
- Aladdin serves 200+ institutional clients generating $1.5B+ in annual technology revenue; your design decisions directly influence client satisfaction, retention, and platform stickiness
- The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme means BlackRock is competing with Google, Apple, Figma, and leading fintech companies for design talent who understand enterprise AI UX
- BlackRock's design function is scaling rapidly — early hires at this level have outsized influence on design systems, standards, and team culture

**Leverage language:** "As a Product Designer shaping Aladdin AI's user experience, I determine how $21T+ in managed assets interact with AI-driven insights. My experience in [enterprise design systems / AI product design / data visualization / financial technology UX] directly accelerates Aladdin AI's adoption curve. I expect an Active Alpha premium that reflects the revenue impact of design quality on institutional client retention."

#### Global Levers

1. **The Adoption Multiplier Lever:** "The most powerful AI is worthless if users can't engage with it effectively. My design work directly determines Aladdin AI's adoption rate across 200+ institutional clients. Every percentage point of increased adoption translates to millions in retained and expanded technology revenue. I'm targeting $190K+ base with $60K+/yr in RSUs."

2. **The FAANG Design Lever:** "I'm currently holding an offer from [Google UX / Apple Design / Figma] at $X total comp. BlackRock's Aladdin platform is a uniquely compelling design challenge, but the compensation needs to be competitive with top tech design benchmarks. Can we bridge the gap with enhanced RSUs or a $20K-$30K signing bonus?"

3. **The Enterprise AI UX Lever:** "Designers who understand both enterprise financial workflows and AI interaction patterns are exceptionally rare. Most designers come from consumer tech or traditional finance — I bring both dimensions. This intersection commands a premium, and I'd like my offer to reflect the scarcity of this specific skillset."

4. **The Design Leadership Lever:** "I'm evaluating this as a career-defining opportunity to build BlackRock's design practice from a position of influence. If BlackRock can structure a package with Director-track progression, a $20K-$35K signing bonus, and scope to define Aladdin AI's design system, I'll commit fully and decline competing processes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $190K-$195K base with $60K-$65K/yr in RSUs. If the initial offer comes in at $150K-$165K base, counter at $185K and cite competing offers from Google UX L5 ($180K base, $70K/yr RSU) or Figma Senior Designer ($175K base, $65K/yr RSU). Push for a $20K-$30K signing bonus to bridge the Year 1 gap. On equity, request $240K-$260K in 4-year RSUs with annual refresh potential. Accept at $175K+ base and $45K+ annual RSUs as your floor — below this, BlackRock is not pricing the design role competitively given Aladdin AI's dependency on exceptional UX for institutional adoption.
