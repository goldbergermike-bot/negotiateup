#### Compensation Benchmarks — 3-Region Overview

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **New York** | $275K-$365K | $440K-$720K ($110K-$180K/yr) | $88K-$148K | **$388K-$548K** |
| **San Francisco** | $290K-$385K | $465K-$756K ($116K-$189K/yr) | $93K-$155K | **$409K-$577K** |
| **London** | £196K-£260K / $245K-$325K | £314K-£513K / $392K-$641K | £63K-£105K / $78K-$131K | **£573K-£878K / $715K-$1.097K** |

*Note: Aladdin AI Platform Engineer compensation includes a +25-35% Signature Premium over standard Director-level engineering ranges. This premium reflects the role's unique position at the intersection of BlackRock's most strategic technology investment (Aladdin AI), the extreme scarcity of qualified candidates, and the direct revenue and AUM impact of platform architecture decisions at this level. This is the highest-compensated IC engineering role at BlackRock.*

#### Negotiation DNA

The Aladdin AI Platform Engineer is BlackRock's most consequential individual contributor role. You are not filling a position — you are defining the architectural future of the platform that manages $11.5 trillion in AUM and processes risk analytics for $21T+ in total assets globally. This is the role where BlackRock's entire AI strategy meets production reality. With BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) publicly committing its competitive future to Aladdin AI, and CEO Larry Fink declaring in his 2024 annual letter that AI will reshape every aspect of investment management, the engineers who architect this platform hold extraordinary leverage. The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme is not abstract at this level — it translates directly into BlackRock's willingness to pay top-of-market compensation for the handful of engineers on earth who can design, build, and scale AI platform infrastructure at financial-industry scale with financial-grade reliability.

You are negotiating against the most elite compensation packages in the industry: Google Distinguished Engineer, OpenAI Staff Engineer, Citadel Principal Engineer, Two Sigma Distinguished Engineer, and Renaissance Technologies research staff. BlackRock knows this. Your "Active Alpha" premium at this level is not a negotiation tactic — it is the market-clearing price for platform architects who can transform $1.5B+ in annual Aladdin technology revenue into $3B+ over the next five years through AI-native capabilities. Price yourself at the signature level.

#### Aladdin AI — The Active Alpha Premium

BlackRock is deploying Aladdin AI across its entire $11.5T+ AUM ecosystem, and the Aladdin AI Platform Engineer is the singular role responsible for defining how this transformation is architected. You do not work on Aladdin AI — you are Aladdin AI's platform architect. Every decision you make reverberates across $21T+ in managed assets, 200+ institutional clients, and $1.5B+ in annual technology revenue.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**
- Aladdin AI Platform Engineers command a **+25-35% Signature Premium** over standard Director-level offers — this is the highest premium of any IC role at BlackRock, reflecting the singular strategic importance of this position
- Your architectural decisions will determine whether Aladdin AI captures the next $1B+ in technology revenue or cedes ground to Bloomberg, MSCI, and emerging AI-native fintech competitors
- At this level, your peer set is measured in dozens globally — engineers who combine platform architecture at $21T+ scale, production ML infrastructure expertise, financial domain knowledge, and the leadership to drive cross-organizational technical strategy
- BlackRock's board-level AI investment thesis depends on the execution capability of this role; you are, in economic terms, the single highest-leverage hire in the technology organization
- The $5-8 trillion AI capex theme means BlackRock will invest whatever is required to secure this talent — the question is not whether they can pay, but whether you negotiate to your full value

**Leverage language:** "I am not evaluating a job offer — I am evaluating whether BlackRock is the platform where I will define the next generation of AI-powered financial technology. My architectural decisions will directly determine Aladdin AI's competitive trajectory across $21T+ in assets and $1.5B+ in technology revenue. At this level, I expect a Signature Premium that reflects both the strategic magnitude of the role and the reality that my peer set is measured in dozens globally. My current competing alternatives confirm that the market-clearing price for this capability is significantly above standard Director-level ranges."

#### Global Levers

1. **The Platform Architect Lever:** "I'm one of a handful of engineers who can architect AI platform infrastructure at the scale and reliability Aladdin demands — $21T+ in assets, 200+ institutional clients, real-time risk analytics, regulatory compliance. My architectural decisions will define Aladdin's trajectory for the next decade. I'm targeting $360K+ base with $170K+/yr in RSUs — this reflects the Signature Premium that this role's strategic magnitude demands."

2. **The Elite Competing Offer Lever:** "I am currently in final-stage conversations with [OpenAI / Google DeepMind / Citadel / Two Sigma / Renaissance Technologies] at total compensation packages ranging from $500K-$800K+. I believe Aladdin is the most consequential AI platform in financial services, and I want to build here — but BlackRock's offer must be within competitive range of these alternatives. The delta cannot exceed 15%, or the economics don't support choosing BlackRock over pure AI or quant fund platforms."

3. **The Revenue Trajectory Lever:** "Aladdin Technology generates $1.5B+ in annual revenue today. My platform architecture will determine whether that grows to $3B+ over five years through AI-native capabilities. At that revenue trajectory, my compensation is a rounding error on the value I create. I want a package that includes meaningful equity upside — $650K+ in 4-year RSUs with annual refresh grants that scale with Aladdin AI revenue milestones."

4. **The Legacy Commitment Lever:** "This is a once-in-a-career opportunity to architect the AI platform that will manage the world's capital for decades. If BlackRock can structure a package at the Signature Premium level — $350K+ base, $650K+ in 4-year RSUs, $100K+ signing bonus, MD-track within 24 months, and a guaranteed compensation review at 12 months tied to Aladdin AI platform milestones — I will withdraw from every other process and commit my career to this platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $360K-$365K base with $170K-$180K/yr in RSUs. If the initial offer lands at $275K-$310K base, counter firmly at $355K and present your full competing offer landscape: OpenAI Staff ($350K base + meaningful equity), Google Distinguished ($340K base, $200K/yr RSU), Citadel Principal ($380K base, $300K+ bonus), Two Sigma Distinguished ($360K base, $250K+ bonus). Demand a $100K-$125K signing bonus — at this talent tier, six-figure signing bonuses are standard market practice. On equity, push for $680K-$720K in 4-year RSUs with guaranteed annual refresh grants of $120K-$180K that are explicitly tied to Aladdin AI platform delivery milestones. Negotiate MD-track commitment in writing with a 24-month review. Accept at $340K+ base and $150K+ annual RSUs as your absolute floor — anything below this range means BlackRock is not pricing this role at the Signature Premium level, and you should pause the negotiation to request a conversation with the CTO or Head of Aladdin Engineering to recalibrate expectations. This is the highest-leverage IC engineering hire at BlackRock — negotiate accordingly.
