| Austin (HQ) | $135K-$195K | $100K-$260K | None | $180K-$320K |
| Palo Alto | $145K-$205K | $110K-$275K | None | $190K-$335K |
| Fremont | $140K-$200K | $105K-$268K | None | $185K-$328K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Tesla work on problems that have direct physical-world impact: optimizing Supercharger network placement, predicting battery degradation curves, analyzing driving patterns to improve FSD safety, modeling energy grid demand for Megapack installations, and optimizing Gigafactory production yields. This is not ad-tech optimization — your analyses influence decisions about billion-dollar factory investments, vehicle design trade-offs, and energy infrastructure deployment. Tesla's data advantage is its fleet: millions of vehicles generating real-world driving, charging, and battery data that no competitor can replicate. No cash bonus; comp is base + RSUs. Tesla data scientists are expected to be highly autonomous — you identify the questions worth asking, not just answer questions handed to you. The breadth of domains (automotive, energy, manufacturing, autonomy) means your work spans industries that would be siloed at other companies. [Source: Tesla Data Science 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Tesla Data Scientist = Google L3/L4 DS = Meta E3/E4 DS = Apple DS (IC2/IC3)

**Global Levers**

1. **Fleet Data Moat:** "Tesla's fleet generates the richest real-world driving and energy dataset in existence — this is a data moat that no competitor can replicate. My analyses directly leverage this proprietary data advantage to drive product decisions worth hundreds of millions."
2. **Cross-Domain Impact:** "I'll work across automotive, energy, manufacturing, and autonomy — domains that would require separate teams at other companies. This cross-domain breadth multiplies my impact and should be reflected in the comp."
3. **Physical-World Decision Impact:** "My analyses inform decisions about Gigafactory investments, Supercharger placement, battery chemistry trade-offs, and FSD safety metrics. These are billion-dollar decisions with physical-world consequences — not A/B test click-through rates."
4. **Autonomy Safety Analytics:** If your role touches FSD safety metrics: "FSD safety analysis has regulatory and reputational implications worth billions. The comp should reflect the outsized impact and responsibility of safety-critical data science."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'll be doing data science across Tesla's unique fleet data moat — analyzing real-world driving patterns, battery degradation, energy grid optimization, and manufacturing yields. My analyses will inform billion-dollar decisions across multiple product lines. I'm targeting $230K in RSUs over 4 years with a base of $185K. I have a Google DS offer at $[X] with stable GOOGL equity and a Databricks offer at $[Y]. Tesla's data scale and physical-world impact are uniquely compelling, but the RSU grant must compensate for TSLA volatility." Tesla will counter at $180K-$220K RSUs. Push for $210K+ with a sign-on bonus of $15K-$20K. Accept if total Year 1 comp exceeds $240K.
