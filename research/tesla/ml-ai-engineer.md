### ML/AI Engineer | Tesla Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Heavy / No Cash Bonus | Mission-Driven Culture | **+15-25% AI PREMIUM** | Stock Volatility Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Austin (HQ) | $160K-$240K | $180K-$450K | None | $260K-$430K |
| Palo Alto | $170K-$250K | $195K-$470K | None | $275K-$450K |
| Fremont | $165K-$245K | $188K-$460K | None | $268K-$440K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Tesla work across the most ambitious AI product portfolio in the world: Full Self-Driving (computer vision, planning, prediction), Optimus humanoid robot (manipulation, locomotion, perception), Dojo supercomputer (custom AI training silicon), and Tesla Bot AI (language understanding, task planning). This is not a company where ML is a feature — ML IS the product across multiple revolutionary platforms. The 15-25% AI premium reflects the extraordinary competition for ML talent: Tesla competes with OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta FAIR, and Waymo for the same engineers. Tesla's unique advantage is the deployment scale — your models run on millions of vehicles and (soon) thousands of robots in the physical world, not just in cloud APIs. The Dojo supercomputer gives you access to custom training hardware purpose-built for Tesla's workloads. No cash bonus; RSUs are the entire variable comp lever.

**Level Mapping:** Tesla ML/AI Engineer (Senior) = Google L4 ML = Meta E4 ML = OpenAI Senior = Waymo Senior ML Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Premium (15-25%):** "ML/AI engineering is the highest-premium technical discipline in the market. Tesla competes with OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic for this talent. The AI premium of 15-25% above standard SWE comp is the market reality, and I expect Tesla to meet it."
2. **Multi-Platform AI Impact:** "My ML work spans FSD, Optimus, and Dojo — I'm not building one model for one product. I'm contributing to Tesla's entire AI platform across autonomous driving, robotics, and custom silicon. The comp should reflect multi-platform impact."
3. **AI-Native Company Competing Offers:** Offers from OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, or Mistral create maximum urgency at Tesla. Even mentioning an AI-native process will accelerate timelines and push equity higher: "I'm in process with [OpenAI/Anthropic] at $[X] total comp. Tesla's physical-world AI deployment is uniquely compelling, but I need the RSU grant to be competitive."
4. **Dojo Access as Career Capital:** Tesla's Dojo supercomputer is a unique training platform. Acknowledge its value while framing it as a two-way benefit: "Dojo access is valuable for my career — but my expertise in [distributed training / model architecture / optimization] is what makes Dojo useful to Tesla. The equity should reflect what I bring, not just what I access."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm an ML engineer with expertise in [specific domain: perception, planning, NLP, robotics, distributed training] working across Tesla's AI portfolio — FSD, Optimus, and Dojo. This is multi-platform AI impact at physical-world deployment scale. I'm targeting $420K in RSUs over 4 years with the 15-25% AI premium applied. I have an OpenAI offer at $[X] and a Google DeepMind offer at $[Y] with stable equity. Tesla's real-world AI deployment scale is why I'm here — but the RSU grant must compensate for TSLA volatility relative to GOOGL/private-company upside." Tesla will counter at $340K-$400K RSUs. Push for $380K+ with a $20K-$35K sign-on bonus to bridge Year 1. Accept if the RSU grant exceeds $370K/4yr.
