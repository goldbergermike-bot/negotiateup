|--------|-------------|----------------------|-------|------------|
| Dallas | $127K–$167K | $28K–$42K | 10–15% | $168K–$228K |
| New York | $140K–$184K | $31K–$48K | 10–15% | $185K–$251K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Match Group build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers AI matching, analytics, and decision-making across the world's largest dating portfolio — Tinder (75M+ MAU), Hinge (fastest-growing dating app), Match.com, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish — driving $3.4B+ in annual revenue from 16M+ paying subscribers. In 2026, Data Engineers are the critical enablers of Match Group's AI transformation — every AI model, every recommendation system, and every matching algorithm depends on the data pipelines, feature stores, and data platforms they build. Without reliable, scalable data infrastructure, AI initiatives cannot deliver ROI. The CFO's 'Higher Bar' for AI investment ROI in 2026 places Data Engineers at the foundation of AI value creation — they determine whether AI teams can iterate quickly with high-quality data or are blocked by data quality and availability issues.

**CFO's Higher Bar — The AI ROI Business Case**

Match Group's CFO has established a 'Higher Bar' for AI spending in 2026 — requiring every AI investment to demonstrate clear, measurable ROI. This is your negotiation superpower: instead of just asking for comp, you present a Business Case that demonstrates your role's ROI. As a Data Engineer, your Business Case centers on building the data infrastructure that unlocks AI value across the entire portfolio:

**My ROI Business Case for Data Engineer:**
- **Revenue Impact:** I build the data pipelines and feature stores that power every AI-driven feature at Match Group. Without my infrastructure, the matching algorithms don't have training data, the recommendation systems don't have real-time features, and the conversational AI doesn't have context. By building a unified cross-brand data platform, I enable AI features that drive a 3-5% improvement in subscriber conversion across 75M+ Tinder MAU and the entire portfolio — translating to $30M-$50M in incremental annual revenue. My real-time data pipelines enable the sub-second AI predictions that power matching and engagement features.
- **Cost Efficiency:** I optimize the data infrastructure that represents a significant portion of Match Group's cloud spend. By implementing efficient data storage (columnar formats, tiered storage, data lifecycle management), I reduce data infrastructure costs by 25-40% ($2M-$5M annually). My pipeline optimization reduces data processing time by 50-70%, enabling AI teams to iterate 3x faster — the equivalent of adding 3-5 data scientists without additional headcount ($750K-$1.25M annual value). Cross-brand data consolidation eliminates redundant pipelines across five brands, saving $1M-$3M annually.
- **Payback Period:** My data pipeline optimizations and infrastructure improvements will deliver measurable cost savings and AI team velocity improvements within my first 2-3 months. With a total comp of $198K, the infrastructure cost savings ($2M-$5M) and AI team enablement value ($30M+ in unlocked AI revenue) generate a payback period of approximately 2-3 days on my annual total comp.
- **Competitive Moat:** I build the proprietary data platform that is the foundation of Match Group's AI competitive advantage. The cross-brand dating behavior dataset — billions of swipes, messages, matches, and relationship outcomes across five brands — is the most valuable dataset in the dating industry. My data engineering creates the infrastructure that makes this data accessible, reliable, and actionable for AI models. No competitor can replicate this data asset, and my infrastructure determines how effectively Match Group leverages it.

The candidate's script: "I know Match Group's CFO has set a Higher Bar for AI ROI in 2026. Here's my Business Case: As a Data Engineer, I build the data infrastructure that every AI initiative depends on. My cross-brand data platform will unlock $30M+ in AI-driven revenue while reducing data infrastructure costs by $2M-$5M annually. Without reliable data pipelines, AI models can't train, iterate, or serve predictions — I'm the foundation of AI ROI. My total comp of $198K has a payback period of approximately 2-3 days based on the revenue and efficiency improvements I'll enable. I'm not just asking for a salary — I'm presenting an investment with measurable returns."

**Global Levers**

1. **CFO's Higher Bar — Present Your ROI:** "Data infrastructure is the foundation of AI ROI — without quality data pipelines, AI models can't deliver returns. I build the infrastructure that determines whether Match Group's AI investments succeed or fail. My data platform optimizations will reduce infrastructure costs by $2M-$5M while enabling AI teams to iterate 3x faster. The CFO's Higher Bar for AI ROI starts with my data engineering."
2. **Multi-Brand Portfolio Impact:** "As a Data Engineer at Match Group, I build data pipelines that unify dating behavior data across Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish. This cross-brand data integration is Match Group's unique advantage — I create a unified view of dating behavior across 75M+ MAU that no single-brand competitor can access. Every data pipeline I build serves five brands simultaneously."
3. **16M+ Paying Subscribers:** "My data infrastructure powers the analytics and AI systems that optimize the experience of 16M+ paying subscribers generating $3.4B+ annually. Every subscriber interaction — swipes, messages, matches, subscription renewals — flows through the data pipelines I build. My data quality and availability directly determine whether AI models can optimize subscriber conversion and retention at scale."
4. **AI Data Platform Scarcity:** "The intersection of modern data engineering (streaming pipelines, feature stores, real-time processing) and AI/ML infrastructure is the most in-demand skillset in data engineering. Companies like Google, Netflix, Spotify, and every AI startup are competing for data engineers who can build AI-ready data platforms. My experience with [Spark/Flink/Kafka/dbt/feature store technologies] directly supports Match Group's AI infrastructure needs — this scarce skillset commands premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $167K base and $42K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Engineer position. Here's my ROI Business Case: my cross-brand data platform will reduce infrastructure costs by $2M-$5M while enabling $30M+ in AI-driven revenue — a payback period under 1 week. I have competing offers from Databricks at $240K TC and Snowflake at $235K TC. Match Group's multi-brand scale means my data pipelines power AI systems across 75M+ Tinder MAU, Hinge's growth trajectory, and the entire portfolio." Accept at $155K+ base and $35K+ RSUs.
