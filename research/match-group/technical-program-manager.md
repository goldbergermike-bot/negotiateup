**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Match Group orchestrate the most complex cross-functional AI initiatives across the world's largest dating portfolio — coordinating engineering, data science, product, and design teams across Tinder (75M+ MAU), Hinge (fastest-growing dating app), Match.com, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish to deliver the AI-powered features that drive $3.4B+ in annual revenue from 16M+ paying subscribers. In 2026, TPMs are essential to Match Group's AI transformation because they manage the cross-brand program dependencies, timelines, and resource allocation that determine whether AI initiatives ship on time and within budget — a direct enabler of the CFO's 'Higher Bar' for AI ROI. Candidates who can demonstrate rigorous program management of AI initiatives with clear ROI tracking have the strongest negotiation leverage.

**CFO's Higher Bar — The AI ROI Business Case**

Match Group's CFO has established a 'Higher Bar' for AI spending in 2026 — requiring every AI investment to demonstrate clear, measurable ROI. This is your negotiation superpower: instead of just asking for comp, you present a Business Case that demonstrates your role's ROI. As a Technical Program Manager, your Business Case centers on program execution that delivers AI initiatives on time, on budget, and with measurable business outcomes:

**My ROI Business Case for Technical Program Manager:**
- **Revenue Impact:** I manage the cross-functional programs that translate AI strategy into shipped products. By coordinating engineering, data science, and product teams across five brands, I ensure AI matching improvements, conversation starters, and premium AI features launch on schedule. Every month of delay on a $50M/year AI revenue initiative costs $4.2M — my program management prevents these delays. My cross-brand coordination ensures AI features that prove successful on one brand (e.g., Hinge) are rapidly deployed across Tinder, Match.com, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish, accelerating portfolio-wide revenue by months.
- **Cost Efficiency:** I prevent the most expensive failure mode in AI development: scope creep and misaligned resources. By maintaining clear program scope, resource allocation, and milestone tracking, I reduce wasted engineering effort by 20-30% across AI initiatives ($2M-$5M annually in avoided waste). My cross-brand program coordination eliminates redundant work across brand teams — preventing five separate teams from building the same AI capability independently saves $3M-$5M annually.
- **Payback Period:** My program management improvements will deliver measurable impact within my first 1-2 months as I assess and restructure AI program timelines. With a total comp of $192K, the revenue acceleration and cost avoidance I deliver ($10M+ annually) generates a payback period of approximately 1 week on my annual total comp.
- **Competitive Moat:** I build the program management infrastructure that enables Match Group's cross-brand AI innovation velocity. The ability to coordinate AI initiatives across five brands, manage complex dependencies between matching algorithms and product features, and ship AI improvements on predictable timelines is an organizational capability that takes years to build. My program management creates the predictable execution engine that compounds Match Group's AI advantage over time.

The candidate's script: "I know Match Group's CFO has set a Higher Bar for AI ROI in 2026. Here's my Business Case: As a TPM, I'm the person who ensures AI initiatives deliver on their ROI promise — on time, on budget, and with measurable outcomes. My program management will accelerate $50M+ in AI revenue initiatives while preventing $5M-$8M in wasted investment through scope discipline and cross-brand coordination. My total comp of $192K has a payback period of approximately 1 week based on the revenue acceleration and cost avoidance I'll deliver. I'm not just asking for a salary — I'm presenting an investment with measurable returns."

**Global Levers**

1. **CFO's Higher Bar — Present Your ROI:** "I'm the CFO's execution partner for AI ROI. Every AI initiative I manage has a clear ROI model, milestone-based delivery plan, and measurable success metrics. I track AI investment against returns in real-time, providing the financial visibility the CFO needs. My program management ensures AI spending meets the Higher Bar — I've prevented $5M+ in wasted AI investment at previous companies through rigorous scope and ROI management."
2. **Multi-Brand Portfolio Impact:** "As a TPM at Match Group, I coordinate AI programs across Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish. This cross-brand coordination challenge is uniquely complex — managing dependencies between five engineering teams, five product teams, and shared AI infrastructure. My coordination ensures a successful AI feature on one brand deploys across the entire portfolio within weeks, not months — multiplying the ROI of every AI investment by 5x."
3. **16M+ Paying Subscribers:** "The AI programs I manage directly impact 16M+ paying subscribers generating $3.4B+ annually. My timeline management determines whether revenue-generating AI features ship in Q1 or Q3 — a 6-month delay on a major AI initiative costs $25M+ in deferred revenue. My program execution directly protects and accelerates Match Group's top-line revenue."
4. **AI Program Management Scarcity:** "Managing AI programs requires a unique combination of technical depth (understanding ML timelines, data dependencies, model evaluation), cross-functional coordination skills, and financial acumen. The intersection of AI technical fluency and enterprise program management is extremely scarce — companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft are competing aggressively for TPMs who can manage complex AI programs at scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $163K base and $42K RSUs over 4 years for this Technical Program Manager position. Here's my ROI Business Case: my cross-brand AI program management will accelerate $50M+ in revenue initiatives while preventing $5M-$8M in wasted investment — a payback period under 2 weeks. I have competing offers from Google at $230K TC and Salesforce at $225K TC. Match Group's multi-brand scale means my program coordination impacts 75M+ Tinder MAU, Hinge's growth trajectory, and the entire portfolio." Accept at $152K+ base and $35K+ RSUs.
