### Relationship AI Engineer (SIGNATURE ROLE) | Match Group Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + MTCH RSUs (4yr vest, 1yr cliff) + 10-15% Bonus + 20-30% AI Premium | Dating & Social Discovery Platform | CFO's 2026 'Higher Bar' for AI ROI | Multi-Brand Portfolio (Tinder, Hinge, Match, OkCupid)

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (MTCH RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|-------|------------|
| Dallas | $185K–$250K | $42K–$65K | 10–15% | $242K–$338K |

**Negotiation DNA**

The Relationship AI Engineer is Match Group's signature role — the specialized AI engineer who sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence, human psychology, and romantic connection, building the AI systems that define the future of how people find love. This role encompasses AI matching algorithms, conversational AI for dating, relationship quality prediction, AI-powered conversation starters, and cross-brand recommendation systems across Tinder (75M+ MAU), Hinge (the fastest-growing dating app), Match.com, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish — the portfolio generating $3.4B+ in annual revenue from 16M+ paying subscribers. In 2026, this is the most consequential technical role at Match Group: the CFO's 'Higher Bar' for AI investment ROI directly validates this role's importance, as Relationship AI Engineers build the models that determine whether Match Group's AI spending generates the romantic outcomes and subscriber value that justify the investment. The 20-30% AI Premium reflects both the extreme scarcity of this skillset and the outsize revenue impact — there are fewer than 200 engineers globally with the combination of deep ML expertise, NLP/conversational AI capability, recommender system experience, and understanding of human relationship psychology required for this role.

**CFO's Higher Bar — The AI ROI Business Case**

Match Group's CFO has established a 'Higher Bar' for AI spending in 2026 — requiring every AI investment to demonstrate clear, measurable ROI. This is your negotiation superpower: instead of just asking for comp, you present a Business Case that demonstrates your role's ROI. As a Relationship AI Engineer — Match Group's signature AI role — your Business Case represents the single highest-ROI investment in the company:

**My ROI Business Case for Relationship AI Engineer:**
- **Revenue Impact:** I build the AI systems that are Match Group's core product — matching algorithms, conversational AI, and relationship prediction. My work directly determines whether users find compatible partners, have engaging conversations, and form lasting relationships. A 5% improvement in matching algorithm precision translates to a 12-18% increase in premium subscription conversion (users who experience better matches are significantly more likely to subscribe). Across Tinder's 75M+ MAU base and the entire portfolio, this drives $80M-$150M in incremental annual revenue. My AI conversation starters — which help users break the ice and maintain engaging dialogues — increase message response rates by 30-50%, directly driving the engagement that converts free users to paying subscribers ($20M-$40M incremental). My relationship quality prediction models identify high-compatibility matches, increasing relationship success rates and driving the word-of-mouth growth that powers Hinge's trajectory.
- **Cost Efficiency:** My AI models automate and enhance functions that previously required massive manual investment. Conversational AI for dating coaching replaces expensive human dating advice services ($5M+ annually). AI-powered content moderation trained on dating-specific safety signals replaces 60-80% of manual review ($4M-$8M annually). My relationship quality prediction models reduce churn by identifying subscribers who are at risk of leaving due to poor match quality — proactive intervention saves $15M-$25M annually in subscriber revenue. My cross-brand recommendation system eliminates redundant model development across five brands, saving $3M-$5M annually.
- **Payback Period:** My initial AI matching improvements will show measurable metric lifts within my first 8-12 weeks as A/B tests validate matching precision, conversation engagement, and conversion improvements. With a total comp of $290K (including the 20-30% AI Premium), the combined revenue impact of my AI systems generates $100M+ in incremental annual value — a payback period of approximately 1 day on my annual total comp. This is the fastest payback of any role at Match Group.
- **Competitive Moat:** I build the most defensible competitive advantage in the dating industry — proprietary AI models trained on billions of dating interactions that predict romantic compatibility, generate contextually appropriate conversation starters, and measure relationship quality. These models improve with every swipe, message, and match across five brands, creating a flywheel that competitors cannot replicate even with equivalent engineering talent. My cross-brand recommendation system leverages behavioral data from Tinder's casual users, Hinge's relationship-seekers, Match.com's serious daters, OkCupid's personality-driven matchers, and PlentyOfFish's diverse user base — an AI training dataset no competitor can assemble. Each month I work, the moat deepens.

The candidate's script: "I know Match Group's CFO has set a Higher Bar for AI ROI in 2026. Here's my Business Case: As a Relationship AI Engineer, I build the AI systems that ARE Match Group's product — matching algorithms, conversational AI, and relationship prediction. My models will generate $100M+ in incremental annual revenue through improved matching, higher conversion, and AI-powered engagement features, while saving $10M-$20M through AI automation. My total comp of $290K — including the AI Premium — has a payback period of approximately 1 day. This is the highest-ROI hire Match Group can make. I'm not just asking for a salary — I'm presenting the investment with the single fastest payback period in the company."

**Global Levers**

1. **CFO's Higher Bar — Present Your ROI:** "I am the CFO's Higher Bar in action. My models are the AI investment that generates the ROI the CFO demands. Matching improvement, conversational AI, relationship prediction — these are the AI bets that drive Match Group's subscriber revenue. My payback period is approximately 1 day on my total comp, which includes the AI Premium. The Higher Bar isn't a challenge for this role — it's a validation of why this role commands premium compensation."
2. **Multi-Brand Portfolio Impact:** "As a Relationship AI Engineer, I build AI systems that deploy across Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish — learning from the behavioral differences between casual dating, serious relationships, personality-based matching, and diverse demographics. This cross-brand AI development is the most powerful training signal in the dating industry. A matching improvement I develop can be fine-tuned for Tinder's swipe-based model, Hinge's prompt-based profiles, Match.com's compatibility scores, and OkCupid's question-based matching — 5x the impact of any single-brand role."
3. **16M+ Paying Subscribers:** "My AI models directly determine whether 16M+ paying subscribers continue subscribing — because match quality is the primary driver of subscriber satisfaction. The matching algorithms, conversation starters, and compatibility predictions I build are what subscribers are paying for. A 2% improvement in subscriber retention through AI-driven match quality generates $68M+ in incremental annual revenue. My models are the product that generates $3.4B+ in annual revenue."
4. **Extreme Talent Scarcity — Relationship AI:** "There are fewer than 200 engineers globally with the combination of deep ML expertise (recommendation systems, NLP, reinforcement learning), production AI experience at scale, and understanding of human relationship psychology that this role requires. The 20-30% AI Premium in my comp reflects this extreme scarcity. Google Brain, DeepMind, Meta FAIR, and every AI dating startup are competing for this talent. My unique background in [specific ML + relationship/social domain expertise] makes me one of the most qualified candidates for the single most strategically important technical role at Match Group."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $250K base and $65K RSUs over 4 years for this Relationship AI Engineer position, reflecting the 20-30% AI Premium for the rarest AI skillset in the dating industry. Here's my ROI Business Case: my AI matching, conversational AI, and relationship prediction models will generate $100M+ in incremental annual revenue with a payback period of approximately 1 day. I have competing offers from Google Brain at $400K TC and Meta AI at $385K TC. Match Group's Relationship AI Engineer role is the only position in the industry where my work directly determines whether millions of people find love — and where my AI systems deploy across 75M+ Tinder MAU, Hinge's explosive growth, and the world's largest dating portfolio. This is the highest-impact AI role in consumer tech." Accept at $230K+ base and $55K+ RSUs.
