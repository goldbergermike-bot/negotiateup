**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Match Group lead the teams building the AI-powered dating experiences that serve 75M+ Tinder monthly active users, power Hinge's explosive growth, and drive the Match.com, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish brands — collectively generating $3.4B+ in annual revenue from 16M+ paying subscribers. In 2026, EMs are the linchpin of Match Group's AI transformation, translating the company's strategic AI vision into shipped products by recruiting, retaining, and directing the engineering talent that builds AI-driven matching, conversation starters, and relationship quality systems. The CFO's 'Higher Bar' for AI investment ROI in 2026 makes the EM role uniquely critical — EMs who can demonstrate that their team's output delivers measurable revenue and efficiency gains will command premium compensation.

**CFO's Higher Bar — The AI ROI Business Case**

Match Group's CFO has established a 'Higher Bar' for AI spending in 2026 — requiring every AI investment to demonstrate clear, measurable ROI. This is your negotiation superpower: instead of just asking for comp, you present a Business Case that demonstrates your role's ROI. As an Engineering Manager, your Business Case centers on team-level output that translates AI investment into shipped products with measurable revenue impact:

**My ROI Business Case for Engineering Manager:**
- **Revenue Impact:** I lead the engineering team that ships AI-powered features driving subscriber conversion and retention across the portfolio. By directing a team of 8-12 engineers focused on AI matching and engagement, I'm responsible for the output that drives a 3-5% improvement in premium conversion across Tinder's 75M+ MAU base and Hinge's rapidly growing user base. This translates to $30M-$60M in incremental annual revenue. My hiring decisions, sprint planning, and technical direction determine whether Match Group's AI roadmap translates to shipped revenue-generating features.
- **Cost Efficiency:** I optimize engineering team productivity, reduce attrition (saving $200K+ per departing engineer in hiring and ramp costs), and make build-vs-buy decisions that save millions. By implementing effective AI-augmented development practices, I can increase team velocity by 20-30%, equivalent to adding 2-3 engineers without additional headcount cost ($500K-$750K annual savings). My team management reduces costly rewrites and technical debt accumulation.
- **Payback Period:** My team's AI feature output will deliver measurable revenue impact within my first quarter as I align the team around the highest-ROI AI projects. With a total comp of $290K, the revenue impact of my 8-12 person team's output generates $30M+ in incremental annual value — a payback period of approximately 3-4 days on my annual total comp.
- **Competitive Moat:** I recruit and retain the engineering talent that builds Match Group's proprietary AI systems. In the fiercely competitive market for AI engineers, my ability to build and maintain a world-class team is itself a competitive moat. The team I lead builds the cross-brand AI platform that no single-brand competitor can replicate — and my retention of this talent prevents critical knowledge transfer to competitors like Bumble or emerging AI dating startups.

The candidate's script: "I know Match Group's CFO has set a Higher Bar for AI ROI in 2026. Here's my Business Case: As an Engineering Manager, I lead the team that translates your AI strategy into shipped products. My 8-12 person team will generate $30M+ in incremental annual revenue through AI-powered matching and engagement features, while I optimize team productivity to save $500K+ through velocity improvements. My total comp of $290K has a payback period of approximately 3-4 days based on the revenue and efficiency improvements my team delivers. I'm not just asking for a salary — I'm presenting an investment with measurable returns."

**Global Levers**

1. **CFO's Higher Bar — Present Your ROI:** "I manage the engineering investment — my team's headcount represents $2M-$3M in annual comp. The CFO's Higher Bar for AI ROI is exactly the discipline I apply: I prioritize my team's sprints around the highest-ROI AI features, measure output in revenue impact, and ensure every engineering dollar generates measurable returns. My Business Case shows a payback period of days on my total comp."
2. **Multi-Brand Portfolio Impact:** "As an EM at Match Group, I direct a team whose output ships across Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish simultaneously. This means my team management decisions — prioritization, architecture guidance, hiring — have 5x the impact of managing a single-product team. The AI features my team builds impact 75M+ MAU across the portfolio."
3. **16M+ Paying Subscribers:** "My team builds the features that 16M+ paying subscribers interact with daily, generating $3.4B+ in annual revenue. Every sprint I plan, every feature I prioritize, and every engineer I hire directly impacts this subscriber revenue base. The EM role at Match Group has outsized revenue leverage because of this subscriber scale."
4. **AI Talent Retention Premium:** "Retaining AI engineering talent is Match Group's most critical challenge in 2026. Every AI engineer who leaves costs $300K+ in recruiting, ramp, and lost productivity. My track record of building high-retention teams — through strong culture, career development, and technical mentorship — directly reduces this cost. Compensating me competitively ensures I'm not recruited away, which would trigger cascading attrition on my team."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base and $65K RSUs over 4 years for this Engineering Manager position. Here's my ROI Business Case: my team's output on AI matching and engagement features will generate $30M+ in incremental annual revenue with a payback period under 1 week. I have competing offers from Spotify at $340K TC and DoorDash at $355K TC. Match Group's multi-brand scale means my team's work impacts 75M+ Tinder MAU, Hinge's growth trajectory, and the entire portfolio." Accept at $225K+ base and $55K+ RSUs.
