#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund spanning discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies in global markets. As a private firm, compensation is delivered entirely as Base + Bonus with no public equity. DevOps Engineers at Point72 operate the infrastructure that keeps billions in trading capital flowing — CI/CD pipelines for model deployment, container orchestration for research environments, infrastructure-as-code for global data centers, and the monitoring systems that ensure zero-downtime trading operations across Stamford CT headquarters, New York, and London. The stakes are extraordinarily high: a deployment failure during market hours can cost millions. Within the IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) division, DevOps Engineers who manage the deployment pipeline for systematic trading models and signal research infrastructure are directly enabling alpha generation, and can negotiate for compensation that reflects this critical-path contribution.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

Point72's Internal Alpha Capture team — the proprietary systematic trading division — depends critically on DevOps infrastructure. Every signal the IAC team deploys, every backtest that runs, every model that moves from research to production passes through the deployment pipeline that DevOps Engineers own. While DevOps Engineers are less likely to receive a direct "Researcher" title than data scientists or software engineers, the IAC division offers a "Research Infrastructure Engineer" or "Research Platform Engineer" designation that carries **15-25% more total compensation** than standard DevOps titles.

This premium exists because the Researcher title family at Point72 recognizes contributions to alpha generation that go beyond traditional engineering metrics. A DevOps Engineer who reduces model deployment time from hours to minutes is directly accelerating alpha capture — and the IAC compensation model rewards this.

**How to negotiate for Research Infrastructure Engineer title:**

1. **Frame deployment velocity as alpha velocity.** Say: "Every minute of deployment latency I eliminate is a minute of alpha captured sooner. My work on the IAC model deployment pipeline is directly tied to the team's systematic alpha generation speed."
2. **Request IAC team embedding.** State: "I want to be the dedicated infrastructure engineer for the IAC division, owning the end-to-end deployment pipeline for systematic trading models. This embedded model justifies the Research Infrastructure Engineer title."
3. **Quantify infrastructure impact on P&L.** Present metrics: "In my current role, I reduced model deployment time by 75%, which our quant team estimated contributed $X million in additional annual alpha through faster signal activation. This is research-level impact."
4. **Benchmark against research platform roles.** Use offers for "Research Platform Engineer" at Two Sigma, Citadel, or DE Shaw as comp anchors rather than generic DevOps roles at tech companies.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Critical Path Infrastructure:** "DevOps at a hedge fund is not the same as DevOps at a tech company. A failed deployment during market hours at Point72 can cost millions. I have a competing offer from Citadel for a Senior SRE at $450K total comp, managing their systematic trading deployment pipeline. Point72's offer needs to reflect the stakes of this role."

2. **Lever 2 — Research Infrastructure Engineer Title:** "I'd like this offer to carry the Research Infrastructure Engineer title within IAC, reflecting the fact that my deployment pipeline work directly enables systematic alpha generation. Standard DevOps compensation does not reflect the P&L impact of this role."

3. **Lever 3 — On-Call and Market Hours Premium:** "Trading infrastructure DevOps requires on-call coverage during global market hours — not just standard business hours. I'd like an on-call premium and a guaranteed bonus floor of $200K to reflect the 24/5 operational demands of supporting a $35B+ trading operation."

4. **Lever 4 — Infrastructure Ownership Scope:** "I want ownership of the complete IAC deployment pipeline: CI/CD for model promotion, container orchestration for research environments, infrastructure-as-code for backtesting clusters, and monitoring for live trading systems. This scope — spanning research to production for systematic trading — justifies Research Infrastructure Engineer title and compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$220K base** and **$230K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($450K total). Reference competing offers from Citadel ($450K TC for Senior SRE) or Two Sigma ($420K TC for Research Platform Engineer). Push for Research Infrastructure Engineer title within IAC to access the 15-25% premium, which can move you from $300K standard DevOps to $375K-$435K. To reach the $466K+ L3 threshold, combine title upgrade with scope expansion and on-call premium. **Accept at $200K+ base and $210K+ bonus** ($410K+ floor) with IAC team placement confirmed and Research Infrastructure Engineer title. Walk away below $180K base or if the role supports general technology rather than systematic trading infrastructure.
