#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund running discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies across global markets. Compensation at this private firm is entirely Base + Bonus — no public equity. Security Engineers at Point72 protect the firm's most valuable asset: its trading strategies, alpha signals, and proprietary research. The firm deploys billions through systematic and discretionary strategies, and a single security breach could expose alpha-generating intellectual property worth hundreds of millions. Security Engineers at Stamford CT headquarters, New York, and London defend the infrastructure, code, data, and communications that power Point72's trading operations. Within the IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) division, Security Engineers who protect systematic trading models, signal research data, and alpha capture systems are safeguarding the firm's core revenue engine — and can negotiate for compensation that reflects this critical responsibility.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

Point72's Internal Alpha Capture team — the proprietary systematic trading division — generates alpha through signals, models, and strategies that represent the firm's most closely guarded intellectual property. Security Engineers embedded in IAC protect this IP, and the "Research Security Engineer" or "Security Researcher" title carries **15-25% more total compensation** than standard Security Engineer titles because the role involves direct alpha protection attribution.

The logic is straightforward: if a security breach exposes an IAC alpha signal to the market, that signal's value drops to zero. A Security Engineer who prevents such a breach is preserving alpha — and alpha preservation is valued the same as alpha generation within IAC's compensation model.

**Why Security Engineers should negotiate for Research Security Engineer title:**

- **Alpha protection = alpha generation.** Preventing the leakage of a $50M annual alpha signal is functionally identical to generating a $50M signal. IAC recognizes this through its compensation model.
- **IP defense is a Researcher-level responsibility.** Protecting signal research data, model parameters, and systematic strategy details requires understanding what makes them valuable. This demands quantitative literacy that goes beyond standard security engineering.
- **Insider threat modeling for alpha signals.** IAC Security Engineers must model threats from competitors, departing employees, and state actors specifically targeting alpha IP. This threat modeling is research work.

**How to negotiate for Research Security Engineer title:**

1. **Frame security as alpha preservation.** Say: "My role protecting IAC's systematic trading IP — signal research data, model parameters, strategy configurations — is directly tied to alpha preservation. A breach of IAC's alpha signals could cost hundreds of millions. The Research Security Engineer title reflects this alpha-critical responsibility."
2. **Demonstrate quant-security fluency.** Show understanding of how alpha signals work, what makes them valuable, and how they could be exfiltrated. This dual expertise commands a premium.
3. **Request IAC-embedded security role.** State: "I want to be the dedicated security engineer for the IAC division, with deep access to understand and protect the systematic trading platform. This embedded model justifies Research Security Engineer title."
4. **Quantify alpha protection value.** Tell the hiring manager: "If I prevent a single alpha signal leak, I've preserved more P&L than most engineers generate in a decade. My compensation should reflect this asymmetric impact."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Alpha IP Protection:** "Security at a $35B+ hedge fund is fundamentally different from enterprise security. I'm protecting alpha-generating intellectual property that competitors would pay millions to access. I have a competing offer from Citadel at $500K total comp for a Senior Security Engineer protecting systematic trading infrastructure."

2. **Lever 2 — Research Security Engineer Title:** "I'd like this offer to carry the Research Security Engineer title within IAC, reflecting the direct alpha preservation impact of protecting systematic trading IP. Standard Security Engineer compensation does not reflect the value of the assets I'm defending."

3. **Lever 3 — Security Clearance and Scope Premium:** "The clearance and trust required to access IAC's most sensitive alpha signals, trading strategies, and model parameters places unique demands on security engineers. I'd like a guaranteed bonus of $240K to reflect the elevated responsibility and restricted mobility that comes with deep access to Point72's alpha IP."

4. **Lever 4 — Incident Response Premium:** "I want a defined incident response bonus clause — if I identify and contain a critical security incident that prevents alpha IP leakage, there should be a quantifiable bonus tied to the value preserved. This aligns my incentives with the alpha protection mission."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$250K base** and **$250K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($500K total). Reference competing offers from Citadel ($500K TC for Senior Security Engineer) or Two Sigma ($470K TC for Security Researcher). Push for Research Security Engineer title within IAC to access the 15-25% premium. Frame the asymmetric value proposition: protecting a single $100M alpha signal justifies premium compensation. If Point72 counters at $220K base, hold firm on $230K+ guaranteed bonus. **Accept at $230K+ base and $235K+ bonus** ($465K+ floor) with Research Security Engineer title and IAC team embedding confirmed. Walk away below $200K base or if the security role covers general enterprise IT rather than trading system and alpha IP protection.
