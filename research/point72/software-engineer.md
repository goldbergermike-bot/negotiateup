#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund operating across discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies in global markets. As a private firm, all compensation is delivered as Base + Bonus with no public equity component. Software Engineers at Point72 build the foundational infrastructure that powers trading systems, risk analytics, and data pipelines across the firm's Stamford CT headquarters, New York offices, and London operations. The Internal Alpha Capture (IAC) division represents Point72's proprietary systematic trading arm, where engineers who can demonstrate direct contribution to alpha generation are reclassified under the "Researcher" title — a designation that commands significantly higher compensation than equivalent engineering or quant titles. Candidates targeting L3 total comp of $466K+ must position themselves within or adjacent to the IAC team and negotiate for Researcher title attribution.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

The IAC team is Point72's proprietary systematic trading division, and it operates under a distinct compensation philosophy. Within IAC, the "Researcher" title is not merely semantic — it carries 15-25% more total compensation than the equivalent "Quant" or "Software Engineer" title at the same level. This premium exists because Researchers have **direct alpha attribution**: their work is tied to measurable P&L impact, and their bonuses scale with the signals and systems they build.

**How to negotiate for the Researcher title as a Software Engineer:**

1. **Frame your work as research, not engineering.** When discussing your contributions, emphasize signal discovery, model iteration, and alpha generation over code quality or system uptime. Point72 pays for insight, not infrastructure alone.
2. **Request IAC team placement explicitly.** During offer negotiation, state that you want to be embedded within the Internal Alpha Capture division. Engineers placed in IAC are eligible for Researcher reclassification after demonstrating alpha contribution.
3. **Reference the title gap.** Tell your recruiter: "I understand that the Researcher designation at Point72 reflects direct alpha attribution and carries a compensation premium. Given my background in [quantitative methods / signal research / systematic strategy development], I believe the Researcher title more accurately reflects the scope of this role."
4. **Benchmark against quant research offers.** If you hold competing offers from Citadel Securities, Millennium, or Two Sigma with "Quantitative Researcher" titles, use these to anchor your Point72 negotiation at the Researcher tier rather than the SE tier.

The Researcher premium can push a standard L3 Software Engineer from the $300K-$435K band into the $466K+ range required by L3 comp targets.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Competing Offer Anchor:** "I have a competing offer from Citadel at $480K total comp for a similar systematic infrastructure role. I would prefer to join Point72's IAC team, but the current offer needs to reflect the market for this skill set."

2. **Lever 2 — Title Reclassification:** "Given that my role will involve direct signal research and alpha attribution within the IAC division, I'd like to discuss being brought on under the Researcher title rather than Software Engineer. My understanding is that Researcher compensation at Point72 reflects the alpha-generating nature of the work."

3. **Lever 3 — Guaranteed Bonus Floor:** "Since Point72 compensation is entirely Base + Bonus with no equity component, I'd like to discuss a first-year guaranteed bonus of at least $200K to offset the lack of vesting equity I'm leaving at my current firm."

4. **Lever 4 — Geographic Arbitrage:** "I'm open to the Stamford HQ or New York office. If placement at headquarters enables access to the core IAC team and Researcher title pathway, I'd prioritize Stamford with a relocation package."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your ask at **$225K base** and **$250K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($475K total). Reference competing offers from Millennium ($460K TC) or Citadel ($490K TC) for systematic trading infrastructure roles. Push for Researcher title within IAC to unlock the 15-25% premium, bringing your floor above $466K. If Point72 counters below $200K base, request a two-year guaranteed bonus of $225K/year. **Accept at $200K+ base and $225K+ bonus** ($425K+ floor) only if Researcher title pathway is confirmed in the offer letter. Walk away below $190K base or if the role is siloed from IAC with no reclassification timeline.
