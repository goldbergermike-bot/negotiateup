### Data Engineer | Point72 Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** `IAC Team` `Researcher Premium` `$466K+ L3` `Systematic Data Infrastructure` `All-Cash Comp` `Steve Cohen $35B+ AUM` `No Public Equity` `Base + Bonus`

---

#### Compensation Table — All-Cash (Base + Bonus)

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stamford CT (HQ)** | $180K - $245K | $160K - $245K | $340K - $490K |
| **New York** | $185K - $255K | $165K - $255K | $350K - $510K |
| **London (GBP/USD)** | $160K - $220K (GBP equiv.) | $140K - $220K (GBP equiv.) | $300K - $440K |

> L3 total comp target: **$466K+** per requirements. Data Engineers in the upper band meet L3 requirements. IAC Research Data Engineer title pushes comp to the top of the range and beyond.

#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund spanning discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies across global markets. As a private firm, compensation is delivered entirely as Base + Bonus — no public equity. Data Engineers at Point72 build and maintain the data infrastructure that feeds every trading decision the firm makes — market data pipelines, alternative data ingestion systems, research data warehouses, real-time streaming platforms, and the data quality frameworks that ensure accuracy across billions of data points daily. Across Stamford CT headquarters, New York, and London, Data Engineers power the firm's data-driven culture. Within the IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) division, Data Engineers who build the pipelines that deliver alternative data, market signals, and factor data to systematic researchers are directly enabling alpha generation — and can negotiate for the "Research Data Engineer" title with its associated compensation premium.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

Point72's Internal Alpha Capture team — the firm's proprietary systematic trading division — is fundamentally a data-driven operation. Every alpha signal the IAC team discovers, validates, and deploys depends on data that Data Engineers source, transform, and deliver. Within IAC, the "Research Data Engineer" title carries **15-25% more total compensation** than the standard "Data Engineer" title because Research Data Engineers have direct alpha attribution through the data assets they make available for systematic research.

**Why the Researcher premium is natural for Data Engineers in IAC:**

- **Data availability = alpha opportunity.** When a Data Engineer onboards a new alternative data source — satellite imagery, credit card transactions, shipping data — they are creating new alpha research opportunities. Each new dataset is a potential alpha signal. This is not infrastructure work; it is research enablement with direct P&L impact.
- **Data quality = alpha quality.** A Data Engineer who ensures 99.99% accuracy in market data feeds prevents false signals from entering production. Data quality errors can cause systematic strategies to take wrong-way positions costing millions. This alpha preservation impact justifies Researcher-tier compensation.
- **Feature engineering is alpha engineering.** Data Engineers in IAC often perform feature engineering — transforming raw data into research-ready features. This work is functionally identical to the first stage of alpha research, and should be titled and compensated accordingly.

**How to negotiate for Research Data Engineer title:**

1. **Frame data engineering as alpha enablement.** Say: "Every alternative data source I onboard creates new alpha research opportunities for the IAC team. Every data pipeline I optimize accelerates signal discovery. This is research enablement, and the Research Data Engineer title accurately reflects my contribution to alpha generation."
2. **Quantify data-to-alpha conversion.** Present examples: "In my current role, I built an alternative data pipeline that enabled the discovery of three new alpha signals generating $X million annually. The data engineering was the bottleneck — and I removed it."
3. **Request IAC-embedded data engineering role.** State: "I want to be embedded in the IAC division, owning the data infrastructure that feeds systematic signal research. This embedded model, with direct collaboration with quantitative researchers, justifies the Research Data Engineer title."
4. **Benchmark against research data roles.** Use offers for "Research Data Engineer" at Two Sigma, "Quantitative Data Engineer" at Citadel, or "Data Platform Engineer" at DE Shaw as comp anchors.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Alternative Data Pipeline Expertise:** "Data Engineers who can build production-grade alternative data pipelines — satellite imagery processing, NLP on earnings calls, web scraping at scale — are extremely scarce. I have a competing offer from Two Sigma at $490K total comp for a Research Data Engineer role building their alternative data platform."

2. **Lever 2 — Research Data Engineer Title:** "I'd like this offer to carry the Research Data Engineer title within IAC, reflecting the fact that my data pipelines directly enable systematic alpha research. Every dataset I onboard is a new alpha opportunity. Standard Data Engineer compensation does not reflect this alpha enablement impact."

3. **Lever 3 — Data Asset Ownership Premium:** "I want ownership of the IAC team's alternative data asset portfolio — including sourcing, evaluation, licensing, ingestion, transformation, and quality assurance for all non-market data used in systematic signal research. This data stewardship responsibility, spanning vendor relationships to production pipelines, justifies premium compensation."

4. **Lever 4 — Guaranteed Multi-Year Bonus:** "Given Point72's all-cash comp model, I'd like a two-year guaranteed bonus: $240K in year one and $220K in year two. This replaces the equity vesting I'm leaving and provides stability while I build the IAC team's alternative data infrastructure."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$250K base** and **$250K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($500K total). Reference competing offers from Two Sigma ($490K TC for Research Data Engineer) or Citadel ($480K TC for Quantitative Data Engineer). Push for Research Data Engineer title within IAC to access the 15-25% premium — this moves you from $340K standard DE to $425K-$490K, comfortably exceeding the $466K L3 threshold. If Point72 counters at $220K base, hold firm on $230K+ guaranteed bonus. **Accept at $230K+ base and $235K+ bonus** ($465K+ floor) with Research Data Engineer title and IAC team placement confirmed. Walk away below $200K base or if the data engineering role serves general technology without IAC alternative data pipeline ownership.
