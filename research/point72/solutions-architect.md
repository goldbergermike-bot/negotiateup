#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund operating discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies across global markets. Compensation at this private firm is entirely Base + Bonus — no public equity component. Solutions Architects at Point72 design the cross-cutting technical architecture that integrates the firm's trading, risk, research, and data systems. They work across multiple technology teams and pods at Stamford CT headquarters, New York, and London to ensure that system designs meet the low-latency, high-throughput, and fault-tolerance requirements of a $35B+ trading operation. Within the IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) division, Solutions Architects who design the architecture for systematic trading platforms, signal research pipelines, and alpha capture systems have a credible path to the "Research Architect" title — which carries the same compensation premium as the Researcher designation.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

Point72's Internal Alpha Capture division — the firm's proprietary systematic trading arm — requires architectural decisions that directly impact alpha generation capacity. Within IAC, the "Research Architect" title carries **15-25% more total compensation** than the equivalent "Solutions Architect" title because Research Architects have direct alpha attribution through their architectural decisions.

The logic is clear: a Solutions Architect who designs a signal processing pipeline that handles 10x more data sources enables 10x more alpha hypotheses to be tested. An architect who reduces backtest runtime from days to hours allows the IAC team to iterate faster on systematic strategies. These architectural decisions are alpha multipliers, and Point72's IAC compensation model recognizes them.

**How to negotiate for Research Architect title:**

1. **Frame architecture as alpha infrastructure.** Say: "The systems I architect are not generic infrastructure — they are the alpha generation engine for IAC. The signal pipeline architecture, backtesting platform design, and execution system topology I define directly determine how much alpha the systematic team can capture."
2. **Demonstrate architectural alpha leverage.** Present examples: "In my previous role, I redesigned the signal processing architecture to support real-time alternative data ingestion, which enabled the quant team to deploy 15 new alpha signals that generated $X million in annual P&L."
3. **Request IAC-scoped architecture ownership.** State: "I want to own the end-to-end architecture for IAC's systematic trading platform — from data ingestion through signal research to execution. This scope justifies the Research Architect title."
4. **Benchmark against research architecture roles.** Use offers for "Quantitative Research Architect" or "Systematic Trading Platform Architect" at Citadel, Two Sigma, or Millennium as anchors.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Cross-System Architecture Scope:** "Solutions Architects at hedge funds design systems that handle billions in daily trading volume across global markets. This is fundamentally different from enterprise architecture. I have a competing offer from Citadel at $540K total comp for a Systematic Platform Architect role. Point72's offer should reflect the trading-critical nature of this architecture work."

2. **Lever 2 — Research Architect Title:** "I'd like this offer to carry the Research Architect title within IAC, reflecting the fact that my architectural decisions directly determine the team's systematic alpha generation capacity. Standard Solutions Architect compensation does not account for this alpha leverage."

3. **Lever 3 — Multi-Pod Architecture Premium:** "My role will span multiple pods and strategy teams within IAC, designing shared infrastructure that amplifies alpha across the entire systematic division. This cross-cutting impact justifies a premium over single-pod architecture roles. I'd like a guaranteed bonus of $260K to reflect this scope."

4. **Lever 4 — Architecture Decision Authority:** "I want final architectural decision authority for the IAC technology stack — technology selection, system topology, data flow design, and platform evolution roadmap. This level of ownership, combined with the direct alpha impact, justifies Research Architect title and compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$265K base** and **$275K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($540K total). Reference competing offers from Citadel ($540K TC for Systematic Platform Architect) or Millennium ($510K TC for VP Solutions Architecture). Push for Research Architect title within IAC to access the 15-25% premium — this can move you from $365K SA to $466K+ at the L3 threshold. If Point72 counters at $225K base, hold firm on $250K+ guaranteed bonus. **Accept at $240K+ base and $250K+ bonus** ($490K+ floor) with Research Architect title and IAC architecture ownership confirmed. Walk away below $215K base or if the architecture role is spread across general technology without dedicated IAC scope.
