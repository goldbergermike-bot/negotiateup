### Senior Software Engineer | Point72 Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** `IAC Team` `Researcher Premium` `$466K+ L3` `Systematic Trading Platform` `All-Cash Comp` `Steve Cohen $35B+ AUM` `No Public Equity` `Base + Bonus`

---

#### Compensation Table — All-Cash (Base + Bonus)

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stamford CT (HQ)** | $225K - $300K | $210K - $335K | $435K - $635K |
| **New York** | $235K - $310K | $220K - $345K | $455K - $655K |
| **London (GBP/USD)** | $200K - $270K (GBP equiv.) | $185K - $300K (GBP equiv.) | $385K - $570K |

> L3 total comp target: **$466K+** per requirements. Senior SEs sit squarely in the L3+ band and should negotiate for the IAC Researcher title to maximize within this range.

#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund spanning discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies across global markets. All compensation at this private firm is delivered as Base + Bonus — there is no public equity component. Senior Software Engineers at Point72 own critical systems: low-latency execution platforms, risk management engines, portfolio construction tools, and the data infrastructure that feeds the firm's systematic strategies. The Stamford CT headquarters houses the core IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) team, with significant presence in New York and London. At the Senior SE level, the gap between a standard engineering title and a Researcher title becomes most pronounced — candidates who successfully negotiate Researcher designation within IAC can see 15-25% total comp premiums, pushing well above the $466K L3 threshold. This is the level where title negotiation has the highest ROI.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

Point72's Internal Alpha Capture division is where the firm's proprietary systematic trading strategies are built, tested, and deployed. The IAC team operates on a fundamentally different compensation model than the broader technology organization. Within IAC, the "Researcher" title carries **15-25% more total compensation** than the equivalent "Quant" or "Senior Software Engineer" title because Researchers have direct alpha attribution — their bonuses are tied to the P&L of the signals and models they develop.

**Why the Senior SE level is the optimal negotiation point for Researcher title:**

At the Senior SE level, you have enough experience and system ownership to credibly argue for alpha attribution. Point72's IAC leadership recognizes that the engineers who architect signal pipelines, backtest infrastructure, and execution systems are as integral to alpha generation as the portfolio managers themselves.

**Negotiation tactics for the Researcher premium:**

1. **Demonstrate alpha proximity.** Articulate how your work directly impacts trading performance. Example: "The backtesting framework I built reduced signal validation time by 60%, enabling the team to deploy three new alpha signals per quarter."
2. **Request Researcher title in writing.** State clearly: "I'd like my offer to reflect the Researcher title within the IAC division, consistent with the direct alpha attribution my role will carry."
3. **Quantify the title gap.** Tell the recruiter: "Based on my research, the Researcher title at Point72 carries a 15-25% compensation premium over equivalent engineering titles. Given that my work will directly contribute to systematic alpha generation, I believe this title and its associated compensation are appropriate."
4. **Use competing quant research offers as anchors.** Offers from Citadel Quantitative Research, Millennium Systematic, or Two Sigma at $550K-$650K for "Quantitative Researcher" roles should be your primary benchmarks — not other engineering offers.

A Senior SE at the bottom of the band ($435K) who successfully negotiates Researcher title can expect to land at $500K-$550K — well above the $466K L3 requirement.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Competing Offer Escalation:** "I have a standing offer from Millennium at $580K total comp for a Systematic VP Developer role. I'm genuinely excited about Point72's IAC team and the scope of the signal research infrastructure work, but the compensation gap is significant. Can we discuss closing that delta?"

2. **Lever 2 — Researcher Title Pathway:** "I want to confirm that this role is embedded within the IAC division and carries the Researcher title. My understanding is that Researchers at Point72 have direct alpha attribution, and I want to ensure my compensation reflects that structure from day one rather than transitioning into it later."

3. **Lever 3 — Guaranteed Multi-Year Bonus:** "Given that Point72's comp is entirely cash-based with no equity vesting schedule, I'd like to discuss a two-year guaranteed bonus structure — $300K in year one and $275K in year two — to provide the stability that vesting equity would offer elsewhere."

4. **Lever 4 — Scope Expansion to Principal Researcher:** "If we can agree on Senior Researcher within IAC today, I'd like to understand the promotion timeline to Principal Researcher. What are the criteria, and what does the comp band look like at that level? I want to ensure there's a clear growth trajectory."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$290K base** and **$330K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($620K total). Reference competing offers from Citadel ($600K TC for Staff SWE) or Two Sigma ($580K TC for Senior Research Engineer). Push aggressively for the Researcher title within IAC — this alone can add $75K-$125K to your total package. If Point72 counters at $250K base, hold firm on a $280K+ guaranteed bonus to maintain $530K+ total. **Accept at $260K+ base and $275K+ bonus** ($535K+ floor) with confirmed Researcher title in the IAC division. Walk away below $240K base or if the role is classified as general technology without IAC placement.
