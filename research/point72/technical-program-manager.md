#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund operating discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies across global markets. All compensation at this private firm is Base + Bonus — no public equity. Technical Program Managers at Point72 coordinate complex, cross-functional technology initiatives that span the firm's trading, risk, data, and research systems. They manage programs involving multiple engineering teams, quantitative researchers, and business stakeholders across Stamford CT headquarters, New York, and London. The highest-impact TPM roles sit within or adjacent to the IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) division, where they manage the program roadmap for systematic trading infrastructure buildouts, alpha capture platform migrations, and signal research pipeline deployments. TPMs who can demonstrate that their program management directly accelerates alpha generation can negotiate for the "Research Program Manager" designation and its associated compensation premium.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

Point72's Internal Alpha Capture division — the proprietary systematic trading team — runs complex, multi-quarter programs to build and enhance alpha capture infrastructure. The TPMs who manage these programs are not administrative coordinators — they are strategic leaders who determine the sequencing, prioritization, and resource allocation for systems that directly generate alpha. Within IAC, the "Research Program Manager" title carries **15-25% more total compensation** than the standard TPM title because Research Program Managers have indirect but measurable alpha attribution through program delivery velocity.

**Why the Researcher premium applies to TPMs in IAC:**

- **Program velocity = alpha velocity.** A TPM who delivers a new signal research pipeline three months early enables three months of additional alpha capture. This has direct, quantifiable P&L impact.
- **Resource allocation is alpha allocation.** IAC Research Program Managers decide which engineering resources are deployed to which alpha-generating initiatives. These prioritization decisions are investment decisions.
- **Cross-pod coordination multiplies alpha.** TPMs in IAC coordinate across multiple research pods, enabling shared infrastructure and knowledge transfer that amplifies alpha across the entire systematic division.

**How to negotiate for Research Program Manager title:**

1. **Frame program management as alpha program management.** Say: "The programs I manage within IAC are not IT projects — they are alpha generation initiatives. Every sprint I accelerate, every dependency I unblock, and every resource I reallocate directly impacts the team's systematic alpha output."
2. **Quantify program delivery impact on P&L.** Present examples: "In my current role, I accelerated a trading platform migration by 4 months, which our systematic team estimated enabled $X million in additional annual alpha."
3. **Request IAC-dedicated TPM role.** State: "I want to be the dedicated TPM for the IAC division's program portfolio, not a shared TPM across multiple technology groups. This dedicated model enables deep domain expertise and justifies the Research Program Manager title."
4. **Benchmark against research program management.** Use offers for "Quantitative Research Program Manager" or "Systematic Trading Program Lead" at Citadel, Two Sigma, or Millennium as anchors.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Trading Program Complexity:** "Managing programs at a $35B+ hedge fund is fundamentally different from enterprise program management. The interdependencies between trading systems, risk platforms, and research infrastructure create a complexity level that standard TPM roles don't encounter. I have a competing offer from Citadel at $475K total comp for a Senior TPM managing systematic trading programs."

2. **Lever 2 — Research Program Manager Title:** "I'd like this offer to carry the Research Program Manager title within IAC, reflecting the direct impact my program delivery has on systematic alpha generation velocity. Standard TPM compensation does not account for the alpha-accelerating nature of this work."

3. **Lever 3 — Guaranteed Bonus Floor:** "Given Point72's all-cash compensation model, I'd like a two-year guaranteed bonus: $225K in year one and $210K in year two. This compensates for the equity vesting schedule I'm leaving behind and provides stability as I establish program impact within IAC."

4. **Lever 4 — Program Portfolio Scope:** "I want ownership of the IAC division's complete program portfolio — including the alpha capture platform roadmap, signal research infrastructure buildout, backtesting cluster expansion, and execution system upgrades. This scope, spanning the full systematic trading technology stack, justifies Research Program Manager title and the top of the compensation band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$240K base** and **$240K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($480K total). Reference competing offers from Citadel ($475K TC for Senior TPM) or Two Sigma ($450K TC for Research Program Manager). Push for Research Program Manager title within IAC to access the 15-25% premium — this is critical for reaching $466K+ at the L3 level, as the standard TPM band tops out exactly at $466K. If Point72 counters at $210K base, hold firm on $220K+ guaranteed bonus. **Accept at $220K+ base and $230K+ bonus** ($450K+ floor) with confirmed Research Program Manager title and IAC program portfolio ownership. Walk away below $200K base or if the TPM role is a shared resource across general technology without dedicated IAC program ownership.
