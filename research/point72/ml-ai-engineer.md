#### Compensation Table — All-Cash (Base + Bonus) | +15-25% AI/Quant Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stamford CT (HQ)** | $245K - $335K | $230K - $360K | $475K - $695K |
| **New York** | $255K - $350K | $240K - $375K | $495K - $725K |
| **London (GBP/USD)** | $220K - $300K (GBP equiv.) | $205K - $325K (GBP equiv.) | $425K - $625K |

> L3 total comp target: **$466K+** per requirements. ML/AI Engineers start above L3 baseline. The +15-25% AI/Quant Premium reflects the extreme scarcity of ML engineers with trading domain expertise. Researcher title pushes to top of band.

#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund executing discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies across global markets. All compensation at this private firm is Base + Bonus — no public equity. ML/AI Engineers at Point72 build the machine learning models and AI systems that generate alpha: NLP models that parse earnings calls and news sentiment, deep learning systems that identify patterns in alternative data, reinforcement learning agents that optimize execution, and time-series models that forecast market movements. The +15-25% AI/Quant Premium reflects the intense competition for ML engineers who can apply their skills to systematic alpha generation. Within the IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) division at Stamford CT headquarters and New York, ML/AI Engineers are functionally Quantitative Researchers who happen to use ML as their primary methodology — and should negotiate for the Researcher title and its associated premium on top of the already-elevated AI/Quant band.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

ML/AI Engineers have the **strongest case of any engineering role** for Researcher title reclassification within Point72's IAC division. The Internal Alpha Capture team — Point72's proprietary systematic trading arm — uses machine learning as a core methodology for alpha generation. ML/AI Engineers in IAC are not building generic ML infrastructure; they are building models that directly generate trading signals, predict asset prices, and optimize portfolio construction. This is alpha research, full stop.

The "Researcher" title at Point72 carries **15-25% more total compensation** than equivalent "ML Engineer" or "Quant" titles because Researchers have direct alpha attribution. For ML/AI Engineers, this premium stacks on top of the +15-25% AI/Quant Premium, creating a potential **30-50% total premium** over standard engineering compensation.

**Why ML/AI Engineers have the strongest Researcher title claim:**

- **ML model output = alpha signal.** The predictions generated by ML models are literally alpha signals. An ML Engineer whose NLP model generates sentiment scores that predict stock returns is doing quantitative research by definition.
- **Direct P&L attribution is automatic.** ML models in production generate measurable P&L. The ML Engineer who built and maintains the model has clear, attributable alpha generation — the strongest basis for Researcher title and formulaic bonus.
- **The market values ML + finance at the highest premium.** The intersection of machine learning expertise and financial domain knowledge is the scarcest and most valuable skill combination in systematic trading. Point72 knows this.

**How to negotiate for ML Researcher title:**

1. **Refuse the "ML Engineer" framing entirely.** Say: "The models I build generate alpha signals that directly produce P&L. This is quantitative research using ML methodology. The appropriate title is ML Researcher or Quantitative Researcher (ML), not ML Engineer."
2. **Demand formulaic P&L attribution.** State: "I expect my bonus to include a formulaic component tied to the P&L generated by models I develop and deploy. This is the standard Researcher compensation model within IAC, and it accurately reflects my contribution."
3. **Stack the premiums explicitly.** Tell the recruiter: "I understand there are two premiums at play: the AI/Quant Premium for ML expertise in finance (15-25%) and the Researcher Premium for direct alpha attribution (15-25%). Both apply to my role. I'd like the offer to reflect this."
4. **Benchmark against quant researcher offers from top firms.** Use offers from Citadel Quantitative Research ($700K+), Two Sigma ($650K+), Renaissance Technologies ($800K+), or DE Shaw ($620K+) for "Quantitative Researcher (ML)" roles.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — ML Alpha Scarcity:** "ML engineers who can build production alpha-generating models in financial markets are the scarcest talent in quantitative finance. I have a competing offer from Citadel Quantitative Research at $700K total comp for a Quantitative Researcher (ML) role, and Two Sigma at $650K. Point72's offer needs to reflect the market for this skill set."

2. **Lever 2 — Stacked Premiums (AI/Quant + Researcher):** "My role in IAC involves both the AI/Quant Premium and the Researcher Premium. I'm building ML models that directly generate alpha signals — this is not infrastructure ML. I'd like the offer to reflect the ML Researcher title with both premiums applied: a base consistent with AI/Quant scarcity and a bonus structure with formulaic P&L attribution."

3. **Lever 3 — Model P&L Attribution Clause:** "I'd like my compensation to include explicit P&L attribution for models I develop. Specifically, I want a formulaic bonus component calculated as a percentage of the annualized P&L generated by my ML models in production. This is the standard Researcher comp model within IAC."

4. **Lever 4 — Research Autonomy and Compute Budget:** "I want research autonomy to explore novel ML approaches for alpha generation, with a dedicated GPU compute budget of at least $500K annually. The ability to experiment with cutting-edge architectures — transformers for market microstructure, graph neural networks for corporate relationships, reinforcement learning for execution — is what drives breakthrough alpha. This autonomy justifies ML Researcher title and top-of-band compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$340K base** and **$370K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($710K total). Reference competing offers from Citadel ($700K TC for Quant Researcher ML), Two Sigma ($650K TC for Research Scientist ML), or DE Shaw ($620K TC for ML Researcher). Push for ML Researcher title within IAC to stack the +15-25% AI/Quant Premium with the +15-25% Researcher Premium. Demand formulaic P&L attribution for your models. If Point72 counters at $290K base, hold firm on $330K+ guaranteed bonus with P&L kicker. **Accept at $300K+ base and $325K+ bonus** ($625K+ floor) with ML Researcher title, formulaic P&L bonus attribution, and IAC team placement confirmed. Walk away below $275K base or if the role is classified as "ML Engineer" without Researcher designation and alpha attribution.
