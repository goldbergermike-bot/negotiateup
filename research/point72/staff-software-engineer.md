#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund executing across discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies in global markets. As a private firm, compensation is delivered entirely as Base + Bonus — no public equity exists. Staff Software Engineers at Point72 are the architectural decision-makers for the firm's most critical trading systems. They design the real-time data pipelines, low-latency execution engines, and portfolio construction frameworks that power billions in systematic capital deployment. The +15-25% premium at this level reflects the expectation that Staff SEs own system-wide architecture decisions that directly impact alpha generation across multiple pods and strategies. Within the IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) division at Stamford CT headquarters and New York, Staff-level engineers who carry the Researcher title operate at the intersection of technology and alpha — their compensation reflects both engineering excellence and measurable trading impact.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

At the Staff level, the distinction between "Staff Software Engineer" and "Senior Researcher" within Point72's IAC division becomes a six-figure compensation difference. The IAC team is Point72's proprietary systematic trading division, and the Researcher title at this seniority carries **15-25% more total compensation** than the equivalent Staff SE title — translating to $95K-$230K in additional annual pay.

This premium exists because IAC Researchers have **direct alpha attribution**: their bonuses are calculated as a percentage of the P&L generated by the signals, models, and systems they build. A Staff SE maintaining the same infrastructure without Researcher designation receives a discretionary bonus based on performance reviews. A Researcher receives a formulaic bonus tied to realized alpha.

**Why Staff-level is where the Researcher premium is most impactful:**

- At Staff level, you architect the systems that multiple research teams depend on. This gives you attribution across multiple alpha streams, not just one.
- Point72's IAC leadership views Staff Researchers as "alpha multipliers" — engineers whose infrastructure decisions compound returns across the entire systematic division.
- The guaranteed bonus component at Staff Researcher is typically 50-70% of total bonus, versus 30-40% for Staff SE. This reduces comp variance significantly.

**How to negotiate Researcher title at Staff level:**

1. **Lead with architectural alpha impact.** Say: "The systems I will architect — backtesting pipelines, signal orchestration, execution optimization — are the multiplier layer for every alpha signal the IAC team deploys. This is Researcher-level impact, not infrastructure support."
2. **Demand explicit alpha attribution in your offer.** Request that your bonus structure include a formulaic component tied to IAC P&L, not just discretionary performance assessment.
3. **Reference the title and its comp implications directly.** Tell the hiring manager: "I understand that Senior Researcher within IAC carries a 15-25% compensation premium over Staff SE. Given the scope of this role and its direct impact on systematic alpha generation, I believe Senior Researcher is the appropriate title."
4. **Anchor to Principal Researcher trajectory.** Frame your negotiation as a two-year plan: "I'd like to come in as Senior Researcher with a clear path to Principal Researcher within 18-24 months, contingent on alpha contribution metrics."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Multi-Offer Escalation:** "I have competing offers from Citadel at $850K total comp for a Staff-level systematic trading infrastructure role and from Two Sigma at $780K for a Principal Research Engineer position. Point72's IAC team is my top choice because of the direct alpha attribution model, but the current offer needs to reflect this market."

2. **Lever 2 — Senior Researcher Title:** "I'd like this offer to carry the Senior Researcher title within the IAC division, not Staff Software Engineer. The 15-25% premium associated with Researcher designation reflects the alpha-generating nature of the architectural work I'll be doing. This is not a title-only ask — it's a compensation structure ask."

3. **Lever 3 — Multi-Year Guaranteed Bonus:** "Given Point72's all-cash compensation model and the absence of equity vesting, I'd like a three-year guaranteed bonus: $450K in year one, $400K in year two, and $375K in year three. This provides the retention stability that equity schedules offer at other firms while maintaining the all-cash structure Point72 prefers."

4. **Lever 4 — IAC P&L Attribution Clause:** "I'd like my bonus structure to include an explicit IAC P&L attribution component — a formulaic percentage of the alpha generated by systems I architect. This aligns my incentives with the team's performance and reflects the Researcher compensation model."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$390K base** and **$500K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($890K total). Reference competing offers from Citadel ($850K TC), Two Sigma ($780K TC), or DE Shaw ($820K TC) for comparable systematic architecture roles. The +15-25% premium at this level means you should never accept below the premium band — if Point72 offers Staff SE at $635K, counter with Senior Researcher at $730K-$800K. Push for formulaic IAC P&L bonus attribution rather than purely discretionary bonus. **Accept at $340K+ base and $400K+ bonus** ($740K+ floor) with Senior Researcher title confirmed in writing and IAC team placement guaranteed. Walk away below $310K base or if Researcher title is deferred as "future consideration" without a binding timeline.
