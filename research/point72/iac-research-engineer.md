#### Compensation Table — All-Cash (Base + Bonus) | +25-35% IAC Research Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stamford CT (HQ)** | $325K - $450K | $360K - $550K | $685K - $1.0M |
| **New York** | $335K - $465K | $375K - $570K | $710K - $1.035M |
| **London (GBP/USD)** | $290K - $400K (GBP equiv.) | $320K - $490K (GBP equiv.) | $610K - $890K |

> L3 total comp target: **$466K+** per requirements. IAC Research Engineers start at **$685K**, far exceeding L3 minimums. This is Point72's highest-compensated technical role outside of Portfolio Manager, reflecting direct, formulaic alpha attribution.

---

#### Negotiation DNA

This is the **SIGNATURE ROLE** at Point72 — the highest-compensated technical position within Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund. IAC Research Engineers sit at the apex of Point72's Internal Alpha Capture division, the firm's proprietary systematic trading arm. They do not merely support alpha generation — they **are** the alpha generation engine. IAC Research Engineers build alpha capture systems that identify, validate, and deploy trading signals at scale; design signal research infrastructure that enables the systematic team to process terabytes of alternative and market data daily; and develop systematic trading models that deploy capital across global equity, macro, and multi-asset strategies.

The +25-35% IAC Research Premium — the highest premium at Point72 — reflects three realities: (1) this role has **direct, formulaic P&L attribution**, meaning bonuses scale linearly with the alpha generated; (2) the skill set required — deep quantitative research methodology combined with production engineering excellence — is the rarest in finance; and (3) IAC Research Engineers compete for talent with the same pool that Citadel, Renaissance Technologies, Two Sigma, DE Shaw, and Jane Street draw from.

Point72's compensation is entirely Base + Bonus with no public equity. For IAC Research Engineers, the bonus structure includes a **formulaic P&L attribution component** (typically 40-60% of total bonus) plus a discretionary component based on research impact, system contributions, and team collaboration. This role operates primarily from Stamford CT headquarters, with presence in New York and London.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

**This section is the core of this SIGNATURE ROLE guide because the IAC Research Engineer IS the Researcher title.**

Point72's Internal Alpha Capture division is the firm's proprietary systematic trading operation, and the IAC Research Engineer is the title that sits at its center. Unlike other roles where candidates must negotiate *for* the Researcher title, the IAC Research Engineer title *is* the Researcher designation — it carries the full +25-35% compensation premium because the role is defined by direct alpha attribution.

**Understanding the +25-35% IAC Research Premium:**

The +25-35% premium over standard engineering titles is the highest at Point72 and reflects the following:

1. **Formulaic P&L attribution.** IAC Research Engineers receive a bonus component that is mathematically tied to the P&L of the alpha signals, models, and systems they build. This is not discretionary — it is formulaic. If your signal generates $50M in annual alpha and your attribution rate is 3-7%, your P&L bonus component alone is $1.5M-$3.5M. The comp table above reflects baseline expectations; exceptional alpha generators earn multiples of these figures.

2. **Full research autonomy.** IAC Research Engineers have the freedom to pursue novel alpha hypotheses, explore new data sources, and develop experimental models. This autonomy — typically reserved for portfolio managers — is what justifies the "Researcher" designation over "Engineer."

3. **Direct market impact.** The models and systems that IAC Research Engineers build deploy real capital in real markets. This is not simulation or backtesting infrastructure — it is production alpha generation.

**How the IAC Research Engineer title compares to "Quant" at Point72:**

At Point72, the "Quant" title refers to quantitative analysts who support portfolio managers with analytics, risk modeling, and strategy backtesting. Quants receive discretionary bonuses based on performance reviews. IAC Research Engineers, by contrast, are autonomous alpha generators with formulaic P&L attribution. The compensation difference is stark:

| Title | L3 Total Comp | Bonus Structure |
|---|---|---|
| Quant Analyst (L3) | $350K - $500K | 100% discretionary |
| IAC Research Engineer (L3) | $685K - $1.0M | 40-60% formulaic P&L + discretionary |

The IAC Research Engineer earns **50-100% more** than an equivalent Quant because of the alpha attribution model. Candidates who are offered a "Quant" title should counter-propose IAC Research Engineer and present the following argument:

"The work I will do — building alpha capture systems, developing systematic trading models, and designing signal research infrastructure — is not quantitative support. It is alpha generation. The IAC Research Engineer title, with its formulaic P&L attribution, is the appropriate designation. I am not interested in a Quant title at the corresponding compensation band."

**Negotiating for IAC Research Engineer when offered other titles:**

If Point72 initially offers you a Software Engineer, ML Engineer, or Data Scientist title, escalate as follows:

- **Step 1:** Decline the offered title and state your preference for IAC Research Engineer. "I appreciate the offer, but the scope of this role — alpha capture systems, signal research infrastructure, systematic trading models — is IAC Research, not [offered title]. I'd like to discuss the IAC Research Engineer designation."
- **Step 2:** Present your alpha generation credentials. Bring specific examples of signals you have discovered, models you have deployed in production, and P&L you have generated or contributed to.
- **Step 3:** Reference competing Researcher-titled offers. "I hold competing offers titled 'Quantitative Researcher' from [Citadel/Two Sigma/DE Shaw] at [$X total comp]. The IAC Research Engineer title at Point72 is the equivalent designation."
- **Step 4:** If Point72 resists, negotiate for a 6-month reclassification clause: "If you cannot offer IAC Research Engineer today, I'd like a written commitment to reclassify me to this title within 6 months contingent on demonstrated alpha contribution, with retroactive compensation adjustment."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Renaissance/Citadel/Two Sigma Anchor:** "I have a competing offer from Citadel Quantitative Research for a Senior Quantitative Researcher at $950K total comp, and a standing expression of interest from Renaissance Technologies. Point72's IAC team is where I want to build my career because of Steve Cohen's long-term commitment to systematic alpha and the direct P&L attribution model. But the offer needs to reflect the market for alpha-generating researchers."

2. **Lever 2 — Formulaic P&L Attribution:** "I want my bonus structure to include explicit formulaic P&L attribution — a defined percentage of the annualized alpha generated by signals, models, and systems I build. This is the core of the IAC Research Engineer compensation model and the reason I'm choosing Point72 over firms that offer higher guaranteed comp but discretionary bonuses. The formulaic component should be at least 50% of total bonus."

3. **Lever 3 — Multi-Year Guarantee with P&L Escalator:** "I'd like a three-year guaranteed bonus structure: $475K in year one, $425K in year two, and $400K in year three, with a P&L escalator clause — if my models generate alpha above $25M annually, the guaranteed floor is replaced by the higher formulaic amount. This structure gives me downside protection while aligning upside with alpha generation."

4. **Lever 4 — Research Autonomy and Resource Commitment:** "I want research autonomy written into my offer: freedom to pursue alpha hypotheses, allocate compute resources (minimum $1M annual GPU budget), access any data source in Point72's alternative data library, and publish findings internally without PM approval gates. Additionally, I want a dedicated research team of at least 2 junior researchers reporting to me. This autonomy and resource commitment is what distinguishes IAC Research from Quant support."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$440K base** and **$520K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($960K total) with formulaic P&L escalator. Reference competing offers from Citadel ($950K TC for Senior QR), Renaissance Technologies (rumored $1M+ TC for Researcher), Two Sigma ($850K TC for Research Scientist), or DE Shaw ($800K TC for Quantitative Researcher). This is Point72's SIGNATURE ROLE — do not negotiate like an engineer; negotiate like an alpha generator. Demand formulaic P&L attribution, research autonomy, compute budget, and team headcount. If Point72 counters at $375K base, hold absolutely firm on $450K+ guaranteed bonus with P&L escalator. **Accept at $380K+ base and $450K+ bonus** ($830K+ floor) with full IAC Research Engineer title, formulaic P&L attribution confirmed in writing, and research autonomy guaranteed. Walk away below $350K base, below $400K guaranteed bonus, or if the role is structured as "Quant" with discretionary bonuses rather than IAC Research Engineer with formulaic attribution. This is the top of the Point72 technical compensation ladder — negotiate accordingly.
