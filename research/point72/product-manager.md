#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund running discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies across global markets. As a private firm, all compensation is Base + Bonus — no public equity. Product Managers at Point72 define and prioritize the internal technology products that power the firm's trading operations: portfolio management dashboards, risk visualization tools, research workflow platforms, and data marketplace interfaces. Unlike consumer-facing PMs, Point72 PMs serve internal stakeholders — portfolio managers, quantitative researchers, and traders — whose feedback loops are measured in P&L, not user metrics. PMs embedded in the IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) division at Stamford CT headquarters or New York manage the product roadmap for systematic trading infrastructure, signal research tools, and alpha capture platforms. These IAC-aligned PMs can negotiate for a "Research Product Manager" designation that carries the same alpha-attribution bonus structure as Researchers.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

Point72's Internal Alpha Capture team — the firm's proprietary systematic trading division — offers a unique path for Product Managers to access Researcher-tier compensation. Within IAC, the "Research Product Manager" title carries **15-25% more total compensation** than a standard PM title because the role involves direct alpha attribution through product decisions that impact signal research velocity, model deployment pipelines, and alpha capture efficiency.

**Why PMs should target the IAC Research Product Manager title:**

- **Product decisions = alpha decisions.** In IAC, the PM decides which signals get prioritized in the backtest pipeline, which data sources are integrated, and how research workflows are optimized. These decisions directly impact alpha generation speed and quality.
- **Bonus structure difference.** Standard PMs receive discretionary bonuses tied to product delivery milestones and stakeholder satisfaction. Research Product Managers in IAC receive bonuses with a formulaic component tied to the division's systematic alpha output.
- **Scarcity premium.** Very few PMs have the quantitative literacy to manage products for systematic trading teams. This scarcity means Point72 will pay a premium for PMs who can speak the language of alpha, signals, and risk.

**How to negotiate for Research Product Manager title:**

1. **Demonstrate quantitative product fluency.** In interviews and negotiations, reference your experience with data products, ML model deployment, or quantitative research tools. Say: "My product background is in data-intensive, research-driven environments where the user is a quantitative professional, not a consumer."
2. **Request IAC placement explicitly.** State: "I want to manage the product roadmap for the IAC division's alpha capture platform. This role is fundamentally a research product role, and I'd like my title and compensation to reflect that."
3. **Frame product velocity as alpha velocity.** Tell the hiring manager: "Every sprint cycle I optimize directly translates to faster signal deployment and more alpha captured. The Research Product Manager title reflects this impact."
4. **Anchor to research-adjacent PM roles at competitors.** Use offers for "Quantitative Product Manager" or "Research Platform PM" at Citadel, Two Sigma, or DE Shaw as benchmarks.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Quant PM Scarcity:** "Product Managers with the quantitative fluency to manage alpha capture platforms are extremely rare. I have a competing offer from Citadel for a Quantitative Product Manager role at $520K total comp. Point72's IAC team is where I want to be, but the offer needs to reflect the scarcity of this skill set."

2. **Lever 2 — Research Product Manager Title:** "I'd like this offer to carry the Research Product Manager title within IAC, with the associated alpha-attribution bonus structure. My product decisions will directly impact signal research velocity and systematic alpha generation — this is research impact, not standard product management."

3. **Lever 3 — Guaranteed Bonus Floor:** "Since Point72 is all-cash compensation with no equity component, I'd like a two-year guaranteed bonus: $240K in year one and $220K in year two. This provides stability while I establish my product impact within IAC."

4. **Lever 4 — Scope Definition:** "I'd like the offer to specify that I own the product roadmap for IAC's alpha capture platform, including signal research workflow, backtesting interface, and model deployment pipeline. This scope justifies the Research Product Manager title and its compensation premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$250K base** and **$250K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($500K total). Reference competing offers from Citadel ($520K TC for Quant PM) or Two Sigma ($480K TC for Research Platform PM). Push for Research Product Manager title within IAC to access the 15-25% premium — this can move you from $350K standard PM to $466K+ at the L3 threshold. If Point72 counters at $200K base, hold firm on a guaranteed bonus of $225K+. **Accept at $220K+ base and $225K+ bonus** ($445K+ floor) only with confirmed Research Product Manager title and IAC team placement. Walk away below $200K base or if the PM role is in general technology without IAC product ownership.
