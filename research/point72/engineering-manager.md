#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund operating discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies across global markets. As a private firm, compensation is entirely Base + Bonus with no public equity. Engineering Managers at Point72 lead teams of 8-15 engineers building the trading technology stack — execution systems, risk platforms, data infrastructure, and quantitative research tools. The role spans people management, technical architecture, and cross-pod coordination across the firm's Stamford CT headquarters, New York, and London offices. Within the IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) division, Engineering Managers who lead research engineering teams occupy a unique position: they manage engineers with direct alpha attribution, and their own compensation reflects the team's aggregate alpha contribution. EMs who negotiate for "Research Manager" or "Research Team Lead" titles within IAC command significantly higher bonuses than those with standard EM titles in the broader technology organization.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

Point72's Internal Alpha Capture division operates under a compensation model where alpha attribution flows not just to individual contributors but also to the managers who lead research engineering teams. Within IAC, the "Research Manager" or "Research Team Lead" title carries **15-25% more total compensation** than a standard "Engineering Manager" title at the same level.

This premium exists because IAC Research Managers are evaluated on their team's aggregate alpha contribution — they are incentivized as alpha multipliers, not just people managers. Their bonuses include a formulaic component tied to the P&L of the signals and systems their direct reports build.

**Why Engineering Managers should negotiate for IAC Research Manager title:**

- **Aggregate alpha attribution.** As a Research Manager in IAC, your bonus reflects the combined alpha output of your entire team. If you manage 10 Researchers each contributing to multiple alpha signals, your attribution is multiplicative.
- **Bonus structure difference.** Standard EMs receive discretionary bonuses based on operational metrics (team velocity, retention, uptime). IAC Research Managers receive bonuses with a formulaic P&L component — typically 30-50% of total bonus is tied to team alpha.
- **Retention leverage.** Point72 values IAC Research Managers highly because replacing them risks disrupting multiple alpha streams simultaneously. This gives you significant negotiation power at renewal.

**How to negotiate for Research Manager title:**

1. **Frame your management style as research leadership.** Say: "My approach to engineering management is research-driven. I build teams that iterate on hypotheses, validate signals, and ship alpha. The Research Manager title reflects this methodology."
2. **Request team placement within IAC explicitly.** State: "I want to manage a team embedded in the IAC division. My compensation should reflect the team-level alpha attribution model that IAC uses."
3. **Anchor to the team's alpha potential.** Tell the hiring manager: "The team I'll lead will directly contribute to systematic alpha generation. A Research Manager title — and its associated compensation structure — appropriately reflects this responsibility."
4. **Benchmark against research leadership roles.** Use offers for "Head of Quantitative Research Engineering" or "Research Team Lead" at Citadel, Millennium, or Two Sigma as your comp anchors, not generic EM roles.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Research Leadership Anchor:** "I have a competing offer from Millennium for a VP Research Engineering Lead at $720K total comp, managing their systematic alpha team. I'm drawn to Point72's IAC structure and Steve Cohen's long-term vision, but the comp needs to be competitive with research leadership roles, not standard EM positions."

2. **Lever 2 — Research Manager Title:** "I'd like this offer to carry the Research Manager title within IAC, reflecting the team-level alpha attribution that my reports will generate. Standard EM compensation does not reflect the scope of managing a research engineering team with direct P&L impact."

3. **Lever 3 — Team Alpha Bonus Structure:** "I'd like my bonus to include a formulaic component tied to my team's aggregate alpha contribution within IAC. This aligns my incentives with the division's performance and reflects the Research Manager compensation model rather than discretionary EM bonuses."

4. **Lever 4 — Headcount and Scope Guarantee:** "I want a guaranteed team of at least 10 engineers in the IAC division from day one. Managing a larger team with direct alpha attribution justifies the Research Manager title and its associated compensation premium. Can we include minimum headcount in the offer terms?"

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$350K base** and **$400K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($750K total). Reference competing offers from Citadel ($700K TC for Senior EM in Systematic) or Millennium ($720K TC for VP Research Engineering Lead). Push hard for the Research Manager title within IAC — this reclassification alone can add $80K-$150K to your package. Request formulaic P&L-based bonus tied to team alpha output. **Accept at $300K+ base and $325K+ bonus** ($625K+ floor) with Research Manager title confirmed and IAC team placement guaranteed. Walk away below $275K base or if placed in the general technology organization without IAC team oversight.
