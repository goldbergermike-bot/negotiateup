#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund operating across discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies globally. All compensation at this private firm is Base + Bonus — no public equity. Product Designers at Point72 design the interfaces that portfolio managers, quantitative researchers, and traders use every day: real-time risk dashboards, portfolio construction tools, alpha signal visualization platforms, and research workflow interfaces. Unlike consumer design, Point72's design challenges center on information density, decision latency, and cognitive load management for users making million-dollar decisions in seconds. The firm's Stamford CT headquarters, New York, and London offices all require design talent, but the highest-comp opportunities exist within the IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) division, where designers who shape the alpha capture platform's interface can negotiate for alpha-adjacent compensation structures.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

Point72's Internal Alpha Capture division — the proprietary systematic trading arm — presents a unique opportunity for Product Designers. While the "Researcher" title is most commonly associated with quantitative or engineering roles, designers embedded in IAC who directly shape the alpha capture platform's interface and research workflow can negotiate for a "Research Designer" or "Design Researcher" title that carries **15-25% more total compensation** than standard Product Designer titles.

This premium is justified because the IAC team's alpha capture effectiveness is directly influenced by interface design decisions. The speed at which researchers can validate signals, the clarity of backtest results visualization, and the efficiency of the model deployment workflow all depend on design quality. A Research Designer's work has measurable alpha attribution through user efficiency gains.

**How to negotiate for the Research Designer title:**

1. **Frame design as research infrastructure.** Say: "The interfaces I design for the IAC team are not just UI — they are research instruments. A well-designed signal validation dashboard can reduce analysis time by 40%, directly accelerating alpha capture. This is research-level impact."
2. **Demonstrate quantitative design literacy.** Show portfolio of data visualization, financial dashboards, or research tool design. Point72 will pay premium rates for designers who understand quantitative workflows without hand-holding.
3. **Request IAC team embedding.** State: "I want to be the dedicated designer for the IAC division's alpha capture platform. This embedded model allows me to develop deep domain expertise and deliver designs with direct alpha impact."
4. **Reference the title premium explicitly.** Tell the recruiter: "I understand that research-attributed roles within IAC carry a 15-25% compensation premium. Given that my design work will directly impact the IAC team's signal research velocity and alpha capture efficiency, I believe the Research Designer title is appropriate."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Trading UX Scarcity:** "Designers with deep experience in quantitative finance interfaces — risk dashboards, alpha signal visualization, research workflow tools — are exceptionally rare. My competing offer from Citadel is $390K total comp for a Senior Product Designer on their systematic trading platform. Point72 needs to be competitive for this specialized skill set."

2. **Lever 2 — Research Designer Title:** "I'd like this offer to carry the Research Designer title within the IAC division, reflecting the direct alpha impact of my design work on the signal research and alpha capture platform. Standard Product Designer compensation does not reflect this scope."

3. **Lever 3 — Guaranteed Bonus Structure:** "Given Point72's all-cash compensation with no equity, I'd like a two-year guaranteed bonus of $180K in year one and $165K in year two. This compensates for the vesting equity I'm forgoing from my current position."

4. **Lever 4 — Portfolio Impact Clause:** "I'd like to define success metrics for my design work that are tied to measurable alpha impact — researcher efficiency gains, signal validation time reduction, decision quality improvement. If these metrics demonstrate alpha attribution, I'd like a commitment to reclassify my title to Research Designer with the associated compensation adjustment within 12 months."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$195K base** and **$200K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($395K total). Reference competing offers from Citadel ($390K TC for Senior Product Designer) or Two Sigma ($360K TC for UX Design Lead). Push for Research Designer title within IAC to access the 15-25% premium, which can elevate comp from $375K to the $430K-$470K range, approaching the $466K L3 threshold. If Point72 counters at $165K base, insist on $175K+ guaranteed bonus to maintain $340K+ total. **Accept at $175K+ base and $175K+ bonus** ($350K+ floor) with IAC team placement confirmed. Walk away below $155K base or if design is centralized away from IAC with no embedded team model.
