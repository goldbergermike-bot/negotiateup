### Data Scientist | Point72 Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** `IAC Team` `Researcher Premium` `$466K+ L3` `Systematic Alpha Analytics` `All-Cash Comp` `Steve Cohen $35B+ AUM` `No Public Equity` `Base + Bonus`

#### Compensation Table — All-Cash (Base + Bonus)

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stamford CT (HQ)** | $210K - $285K | $190K - $300K | $400K - $585K |
| **New York** | $220K - $295K | $200K - $310K | $420K - $605K |
| **London (GBP/USD)** | $185K - $255K (GBP equiv.) | $170K - $270K (GBP equiv.) | $355K - $525K |

> L3 total comp target: **$466K+** per requirements. Data Scientists in the mid-to-upper band meet L3 requirements. IAC Researcher title negotiation pushes comp to the top of the range.

#### Negotiation DNA

Point72 is Steve Cohen's $35B+ multi-strategy hedge fund executing discretionary, systematic, and macro strategies across global markets. Compensation at this private firm is entirely Base + Bonus — no public equity exists. Data Scientists at Point72 sit at the intersection of quantitative research and technology, building statistical models, analyzing alternative data sets, developing predictive signals, and creating the analytical frameworks that inform both discretionary and systematic trading decisions. The firm's Stamford CT headquarters, New York offices, and London presence all employ Data Scientists, but the highest-impact — and highest-comp — positions are within the IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) division. IAC Data Scientists who work on signal discovery, alpha factor research, and systematic strategy analytics are functionally doing the same work as Quantitative Researchers, and should negotiate for the Researcher title and its associated premium.

#### Internal Alpha Capture — The Researcher Title Premium

Data Science at Point72 is uniquely positioned relative to the Researcher title premium because **the work is functionally identical to quantitative research**. Within the IAC (Internal Alpha Capture) division — Point72's proprietary systematic trading arm — Data Scientists who discover predictive signals in alternative data, build factor models, and validate alpha hypotheses are doing Researcher-level work by any definition. The "Researcher" title at Point72 carries **15-25% more total compensation** than equivalent "Data Scientist" or "Quant" titles because Researchers have direct alpha attribution — their bonuses are formulaically tied to the P&L impact of their signal discoveries.

**Why Data Scientists have the strongest case for Researcher reclassification:**

- **Signal discovery is alpha research.** When a Data Scientist identifies a predictive signal in satellite imagery, credit card data, or web scraping outputs, that is alpha research. The Researcher title accurately reflects this contribution.
- **Direct P&L attribution is natural.** Unlike infrastructure engineers who must argue for indirect alpha attribution, Data Scientists in IAC can point to specific signals they discovered and the P&L those signals generated. This makes the case for Researcher title — and formulaic bonus — straightforward.
- **The "Data Scientist" title undervalues the role.** At hedge funds, "Data Scientist" often signals a support role. "Researcher" signals alpha generation. The same work, titled differently, commands 15-25% more compensation.

**How to negotiate for Researcher title as a Data Scientist:**

1. **Refuse the "Data Scientist" framing.** Say: "The role as described — signal discovery, factor modeling, alpha hypothesis validation — is quantitative research. I'd like my title to reflect that. Researcher is the appropriate designation within IAC."
2. **Demand formulaic alpha attribution.** State: "I expect my bonus to include a formulaic component tied to the P&L of signals I discover and validate. This is the standard Researcher compensation model in IAC."
3. **Present your signal discovery portfolio.** Bring specific examples of predictive signals you have developed, validated, and deployed. Quantify their impact. This makes the Researcher case irrefutable.
4. **Benchmark against Quant Researcher offers.** Use offers from Citadel Quantitative Research ($550K+), Two Sigma ($520K+), or DE Shaw ($500K+) for "Quantitative Researcher" roles as your anchors — not Data Scientist offers from tech companies.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Alpha Research Reclassification:** "The work I'll be doing in IAC — signal discovery in alternative data, factor model development, alpha hypothesis testing — is quantitative research by any definition. I have a competing offer from Two Sigma titled 'Quantitative Researcher' at $550K total comp. I'd like Point72 to match both the title and the compensation."

2. **Lever 2 — Researcher Title and Formulaic Bonus:** "I'd like this offer to carry the Researcher title within IAC, with a bonus structure that includes formulaic P&L attribution for signals I discover. The standard Data Scientist discretionary bonus model does not reflect the alpha-generating nature of this role."

3. **Lever 3 — Alternative Data Premium:** "My expertise in alternative data — satellite imagery analysis, NLP on earnings transcripts, web-scraped consumer data — is directly monetizable as alpha. This specialization commands a premium over standard data science roles. I'd like the compensation to reflect the revenue-generating nature of alternative data research."

4. **Lever 4 — Multi-Year Guaranteed Bonus:** "Given Point72's all-cash structure with no equity, I'd like a two-year guaranteed bonus: $280K in year one and $260K in year two. This provides stability while I build my signal research portfolio within IAC and replaces the equity vesting I'm leaving behind."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at **$280K base** and **$300K guaranteed first-year bonus** ($580K total). Reference competing offers from Two Sigma ($550K TC for Quant Researcher), Citadel ($530K TC for Senior Data Scientist), or DE Shaw ($500K TC for Research Scientist). Push aggressively for Researcher title — Data Scientists have the strongest natural case for this reclassification because signal discovery IS alpha research. The 15-25% Researcher premium can move you from $400K DS to $466K+ at L3 minimum. **Accept at $250K+ base and $260K+ bonus** ($510K+ floor) with confirmed Researcher title and IAC team placement. Walk away below $225K base or if the role is classified as analytics support rather than alpha research.
