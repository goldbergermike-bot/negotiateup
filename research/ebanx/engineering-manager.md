**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at EBANX occupy a uniquely leveraged position: they lead teams that build and maintain the payment infrastructure processing $1B+ monthly TPV across 15+ countries in Latin America and Africa for merchants like Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, and Shein. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study signals that EBANX's next growth phase will be defined by agentic commerce — AI agents autonomously executing cross-border transactions — which means Engineering Managers must build and lead teams capable of delivering on a paradigm shift while maintaining the reliability of an already massive payments platform. As a private company valued at $3.5B with Advent International and FTV Capital backing, EBANX offers options with 4-year vesting that carry meaningful pre-liquidity upside.

The Know Your Agent (KYA) initiative transforms what Engineering Managers need to hire for and how they organize their teams. Traditional payments engineering teams optimize for reliability, throughput, and regulatory compliance. KYA adds agent behavior modeling, delegation chain verification, and real-time autonomous transaction monitoring to the engineering mandate. Managers must build Agentic Testing capabilities into their teams' DNA — ensuring that every release is validated against AI agent interaction patterns across Pix and dozens of other local payment methods. Curitiba remains EBANX's engineering center of gravity, but São Paulo and Austin managers increasingly lead distributed, cross-border teams. Compensation reflects the management premium plus the private-company equity opportunity.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

**1. Beyond Borders Team Building Mandate**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study creates an explicit hiring mandate for agentic commerce teams. As an EM, you are the person who will build these teams:

> *"The Beyond Borders study from Feb 10 makes clear that EBANX needs to stand up agentic commerce capabilities rapidly. As an Engineering Manager, I will be the one building the teams that deliver on this vision — hiring the engineers, defining the architecture standards, and establishing the Agentic Testing practices. Team-building for a paradigm shift carries a premium over managing steady-state teams. I'm targeting R$400,000 base in Curitiba with R$240,000 in options over four years."*

**2. KYA Organizational Design**

Know Your Agent requires new team structures. The EM who designs the KYA org has outsized influence:

> *"Know Your Agent is not just a technical challenge — it's an organizational one. You need teams that span identity, compliance, payments, and AI. I've built cross-functional engineering organizations at this scale before, and I understand how to structure teams so that KYA ships on time without destabilizing the core Pix integration and settlement pipelines. For the organizational design scope of KYA, I'd like to see total comp at R$700,000+ in São Paulo, with the options grant reflecting the strategic nature of this build."*

**3. Multi-Country Engineering Leadership**

Managing engineering teams across 15+ countries with distinct regulatory environments and payment methods is a rare management skill:

> *"Leading engineering teams that ship payment integrations across 15+ countries in LatAm and Africa — each with different regulatory requirements, local payment methods, and Pix-style real-time settlement expectations — requires a specific kind of management experience. I've led distributed teams across comparable regulatory complexity. My ask is $235,000 base in Austin with $120,000 in options over four years."*

**4. Agentic Testing Culture**

Building Agentic Testing capability is as much a management challenge as a technical one — the EM must embed it into team culture:

> *"Agentic Testing is a new discipline, and embedding it into engineering culture requires deliberate management. I need to hire engineers who think about AI agent edge cases, establish Agentic Testing as a release gate, and build feedback loops between the KYA compliance team and the payments engineering teams. This culture-building work is a management premium. I'm asking for a signing bonus of R$40,000 to reflect the immediate organizational impact I'll have."*
