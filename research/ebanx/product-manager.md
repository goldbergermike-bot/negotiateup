**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at EBANX define the roadmap for a payments platform that touches hundreds of millions of consumers across 15+ countries in Latin America and Africa. The company processes over $1B in monthly TPV for merchants including Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, and Shein, meaning PM decisions ripple across enormous transaction volumes. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study has reshaped EBANX's product strategy, placing agentic commerce — the ability for AI agents to initiate, authorize, and complete purchases autonomously — at the center of the next product cycle. PMs who can navigate this transition while maintaining the existing merchant product suite command significant leverage in negotiation.

As a private company valued at approximately $3.5B and backed by Advent International and FTV Capital, EBANX's options grants (4-year vesting) carry real upside for PMs who believe in a liquidity event. The transition from KYC to "Know Your Agent" (KYA) is fundamentally a product problem before it is an engineering one: defining what agent authorization looks like, how consumers grant and revoke agent permissions, and what the merchant experience is when an AI agent pays via Pix versus a human customer. PMs must also own the Agentic Testing product requirements — ensuring that the QA surface covers AI agent behavior across every payment method in every market. Curitiba-based PMs sit closest to engineering; São Paulo PMs often focus on merchant relationships; Austin PMs own US merchant acquisition and global product strategy.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

**1. Beyond Borders Product Vision**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study is your product strategy anchor. PMs who can translate this data into roadmap items command premium offers:

> *"The Beyond Borders study from Feb 10 projects that agentic commerce will reshape how consumers interact with LatAm merchants. As a PM, I would own the product vision for how EBANX enables merchants like Spotify and Shein to accept agent-initiated transactions seamlessly. I've shipped cross-border payment products at comparable complexity. Given the strategic importance of this product line, I'm targeting R$340,000 base in Curitiba with R$180,000 in options over four years."*

**2. KYA Consumer Experience Ownership**

The Know Your Agent product experience — how consumers authorize agents and how merchants handle agent transactions — is a PM-owned domain:

> *"Know Your Agent is first and foremost a product design challenge. How does a consumer in Brazil grant an AI agent permission to make a Pix payment? How does a merchant in Mexico know the agent is authorized? These are UX and product problems I'd own. I've designed consumer authorization flows for financial products with similar regulatory constraints. For owning the KYA consumer experience, I'm asking for total comp of R$600,000+ in São Paulo, with an options package that reflects the pre-IPO opportunity."*

**3. Pix Agent Payment Flow Design**

Pix is EBANX's fastest and most popular payment method. Defining how AI agents use Pix is a high-impact PM challenge:

> *"Pix is the backbone of EBANX's Brazilian payments volume, and defining how AI agents interact with Pix — instant authorization, real-time settlement confirmation, agent identity in the Pix message payload — is a product decision with enormous downstream impact. I've shipped real-time payment products at this scale. My ask is $205,000 base in Austin with a signing bonus of $15,000 to accelerate my start."*

**4. Agentic Testing Product Requirements**

PMs own the requirements for Agentic Testing — defining what "safe agent behavior" means across every market and payment method:

> *"Agentic Testing requires product thinking, not just engineering. Someone needs to define what a 'safe' agent transaction looks like across Pix in Brazil, OXXO in Mexico, and PSE in Colombia. That's a product requirements challenge spanning 15+ countries and dozens of payment methods. I want to own the Agentic Testing product requirements. For this scope, I'm targeting R$350,000 base with R$200,000 in options over four years in Curitiba."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 14-18% uplift on the initial base offer. For Curitiba, push for R$330,000+ base with R$170,000+ in options (4yr vest). For São Paulo, target R$390,000+ with R$220,000+ in options. For Austin, target $200,000+ with $85,000+ in options. Your accept-at floor: R$265,000 / R$310,000 / $170,000 base respectively, with minimum options of R$110,000 / R$140,000 / $50,000. PMs should also negotiate for product conference budget ($3,000-$5,000/yr), direct access to merchant data for product decisions, and a 12-month options refresh guarantee tied to product milestones.
