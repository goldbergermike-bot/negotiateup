**Negotiation DNA**

EBANX sits at the intersection of LatAm financial infrastructure and global commerce, processing over $1B in monthly TPV for merchants like Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, and Shein across 15+ countries in Latin America and Africa. As a private company valued at approximately $3.5B and backed by Advent International and FTV Capital, EBANX offers equity compensation through stock options with a standard 4-year vesting schedule. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study underscores the company's strategic pivot toward agentic commerce, where AI-driven agents autonomously execute cross-border transactions on behalf of consumers. This shift from traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) to "Know Your Agent" (KYA) compliance creates entirely new engineering challenges that demand fresh talent.

For a Software Engineer, the negotiation landscape is shaped by EBANX's Curitiba headquarters competing with São Paulo's larger tech talent pool and Austin's US operations. Brazil-based compensation is denominated in BRL but benchmarked against USD equivalents given the company's global footprint. The company's deep integration with Pix, Brazil's instant payment system, and its expansion into local payment methods across emerging markets means that engineers touching payment processing infrastructure carry outsized leverage. Agentic Testing capabilities — validating that AI agents can safely conduct financial transactions — represent a greenfield engineering domain where few candidates have direct experience, giving negotiation room even at the entry Software Engineer level.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

**1. Beyond Borders Data Leverage**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study projects that agentic commerce will drive 18-25% of cross-border LatAm transaction volume by 2028. Use this data to frame your value as forward-looking:

> *"I noticed the Feb 10 Beyond Borders study highlights agentic commerce as the next growth vector for cross-border payments. I've been building payment integration systems that would directly support this trajectory. Given that EBANX is positioning itself at the forefront of this shift, I believe a base closer to R$200,000 in Curitiba reflects the premium that agentic-aware engineers command."*

**2. Know Your Agent (KYA) Compliance Premium**

The transition from KYC to KYA compliance requires engineers who understand both identity verification and autonomous agent behavior. This is a scarcity-driven lever:

> *"The Know Your Agent framework is fundamentally different from traditional KYC — it requires understanding agent delegation chains, permission scoping, and real-time behavioral verification. I bring experience in identity systems that translates directly to KYA. I'd like to see the options grant increased to R$90,000 over four years to reflect this specialization."*

**3. Pix & Local Payment Methods Expertise**

EBANX's competitive moat is its deep integration with local payment methods, especially Pix. Engineers with Pix experience are in short supply:

> *"My experience building on top of Pix's instant settlement infrastructure is directly relevant to EBANX's core product. As you expand Pix-based flows to support agentic transactions, this expertise becomes even more critical. I'd like to discuss a signing bonus of R$20,000 to bridge the gap between my current compensation and this offer."*

**4. Agentic Testing Capability**

Agentic Testing — ensuring AI agents can safely execute financial transactions — is a new discipline. Position yourself as early to this capability:

> *"I've been investing in understanding Agentic Testing patterns — how to validate that autonomous agents handle payment flows safely across different LatAm payment methods. This is exactly the kind of quality assurance EBANX will need as it rolls out KYA. I'm targeting total comp of R$300,000 in Curitiba to reflect this forward-looking skillset."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 12-18% uplift on the initial base offer by combining the Beyond Borders agentic commerce narrative with Pix expertise. For Curitiba, push for R$195,000+ base with R$75,000+ in options (4yr vest). For Austin, target $138,000+ base with $35,000+ in options. Your accept-at floor should be no lower than R$170,000 / $120,000 base, with a minimum of R$50,000 / $25,000 in options. If the base is firm, negotiate for accelerated vesting on the first year (25% cliff at 6 months instead of 12) or a signing bonus equivalent to 10% of base.
