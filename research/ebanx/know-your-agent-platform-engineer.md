**Negotiation DNA**

The Know Your Agent Platform Engineer is the most strategically important engineering hire EBANX will make in 2026. This role sits at the exact intersection of EBANX's core competency — processing $1B+ in monthly TPV for merchants like Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, and Shein across 15+ countries in Latin America and Africa — and its defining strategic bet: agentic commerce. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study made it explicit: AI agents will increasingly initiate, authorize, and complete cross-border purchases autonomously, and the payments infrastructure that can verify, trust, and process agent-mediated transactions will capture the next wave of LatAm commerce growth. The KYA Platform Engineer builds this trust layer from the ground up.

This is a greenfield platform role. EBANX's existing infrastructure was designed for human consumers — identity verification via KYC (CPF in Brazil, CURP in Mexico, CC in Colombia), payment authorization via consumer-facing UX, and fraud detection via human behavioral models. None of these systems are designed for autonomous AI agents. The KYA Platform Engineer must architect and build an entirely new platform layer: agent identity registration and verification, delegation chain management (how a consumer grants an agent permission to transact), authorization scope enforcement (what an agent is allowed to buy, spend, and pay with), real-time behavioral monitoring (is this agent acting within expected bounds), and cross-jurisdictional compliance (KYA requirements will differ across Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and the African markets EBANX operates in). This platform must integrate seamlessly with Pix for real-time settlement, boleto for deferred payment, and dozens of other local payment methods — all at the latency and reliability standards that $1B+ monthly TPV demands.

As a private company valued at approximately $3.5B and backed by Advent International and FTV Capital, EBANX offers stock options with a standard 4-year vesting schedule. For the KYA Platform Engineer, the options grant is particularly meaningful: this role is building the platform that will define whether EBANX captures or misses the agentic commerce opportunity. If the KYA platform succeeds, it becomes EBANX's primary competitive moat — the reason merchants choose EBANX over dLocal, Mercado Pago, or Adyen for agent-mediated transactions. This success would drive significant valuation growth, making pre-liquidity options exceptionally valuable. The negotiation leverage is clear: there are very few engineers in the world who have built agent identity and authorization platforms for financial transactions, because the discipline barely exists. Every candidate is bringing transferable skills from adjacent domains — identity platforms, authorization systems, compliance infrastructure, payments engineering — and combining them in a novel way. This scarcity premium should be aggressively monetized in negotiation.

Curitiba is the natural home for this role, as the Curitiba headquarters houses EBANX's core engineering teams and the KYA Platform will be the most tightly integrated new system in the company's architecture. São Paulo offers proximity to Brazil's merchant ecosystem and regulatory relationships with Banco Central. Austin provides USD-denominated compensation with exposure to US merchant acquisition and global platform strategy. Regardless of location, the KYA Platform Engineer will have significant cross-office and cross-functional influence, working with security, compliance, product, data science, and ML/AI teams.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

This role IS the Know Your Agent premium. Every lever below is directly tied to the KYA Platform Engineer's core mandate. Use these negotiation scripts with the understanding that you are not arguing for a premium on top of your role — your entire role IS the premium.

**1. Beyond Borders Strategic Mandate**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study is your foundational document. It establishes that agentic commerce is not a speculative bet but a strategic imperative for EBANX. The KYA Platform Engineer is the person who makes this imperative real:

> *"The Beyond Borders study from Feb 10 explicitly identifies agentic commerce as the next growth vector for LatAm cross-border payments. EBANX's response to this — the Know Your Agent platform — is the single most important engineering initiative the company will undertake in the next two years. I am interviewing for the role that builds this platform. The compensation should reflect three realities: first, this is greenfield platform engineering at a company processing $1B+ monthly TPV, which means the risk and impact are both extremely high. Second, there are very few engineers who have built agent identity and authorization platforms for financial systems, because the discipline barely exists — so the talent market is severely supply-constrained. Third, the success of this platform directly determines whether EBANX captures the agentic commerce opportunity or cedes it to dLocal, Mercado Pago, or Adyen. Given these factors, I'm targeting R$420,000 base in Curitiba with R$280,000 in options over four years. For São Paulo, I'd expect R$490,000 base with R$350,000 in options. In Austin, my target is $250,000 base with $140,000 in options."*

**2. Know Your Agent Architecture Ownership**

This is not a feature — it is a platform. The KYA Platform Engineer who designs the foundational architecture will determine the shape of EBANX's agentic commerce capabilities for years. This architectural ownership is the strongest negotiation lever:

> *"Know Your Agent is a platform with at least five major subsystems: agent identity registration and verification, delegation chain management, authorization scope enforcement, real-time behavioral monitoring, and cross-jurisdictional compliance. Each of these subsystems must integrate with Pix for sub-second settlement, support dozens of local payment methods across 15+ countries, and operate at the reliability standards of a $1B+ monthly TPV platform. I would be designing the architecture that ties all of these together. This is not a feature that can be rebuilt if the first version is wrong — it is foundational. The architecture decisions I make in the first six months will constrain or enable EBANX's agentic commerce capabilities for the next five years. For this level of architectural ownership, I need the options grant to reflect the outsized impact: R$300,000 in options over four years in Curitiba, R$380,000 in São Paulo, or $150,000 in Austin. I'd also like to discuss secondary sale provisions, because the value I'm creating will be locked up until a liquidity event, and I need some mechanism to realize value earlier."*

**3. Agent Identity Across LatAm Jurisdictions**

Building agent identity verification across 15+ countries with different identity document systems, regulatory frameworks, and data sovereignty requirements is a challenge unique to EBANX's market position:

> *"EBANX operates across 15+ countries, each with different identity document systems — CPF in Brazil, CURP in Mexico, CC in Colombia, RUT in Chile, DNI in Argentina and Peru. Know Your Agent means building an agent identity layer that works across ALL of these systems: an agent authorized by a Brazilian consumer using their CPF must be recognized when it initiates a Pix payment, while an agent authorized by a Mexican consumer using their CURP must work with OXXO. This cross-jurisdictional agent identity architecture is something no other payments company has built. I bring experience in multi-jurisdiction identity systems, and I understand the regulatory nuances. For building the cross-jurisdictional KYA identity layer, I'm targeting total comp above R$750,000 in São Paulo — with the options grant structured to reflect the multi-year, platform-level impact of this work."*

**4. Pix-Native KYA Verification**

Pix is EBANX's highest-volume, lowest-latency payment method. The KYA verification layer must operate within Pix's real-time settlement constraints:

> *"Pix settles in real time — the KYA verification for an agent-initiated Pix payment must complete within the same latency budget as the Pix transaction itself. This means the agent identity check, delegation chain verification, authorization scope validation, and behavioral risk score must all compute in under 200 milliseconds. I've built real-time verification systems at comparable latency and throughput requirements. The Pix-native KYA verification layer is the hardest engineering challenge in this role, and it's also the one that directly protects EBANX's merchants from agent fraud on their highest-volume payment rail. For this level of real-time systems complexity, my base ask is $250,000 in Austin with $140,000 in options, or R$415,000 in Curitiba with R$275,000 in options."*

**5. Agentic Testing Platform for KYA**

The KYA Platform Engineer must also build the Agentic Testing infrastructure that validates the KYA platform itself — testing agent identity verification, delegation chain enforcement, and authorization scope validation across every payment method and country:

> *"Agentic Testing for the KYA platform is recursive: I'm building the platform that verifies agents, and I also need to build the testing infrastructure that verifies the platform. This means creating synthetic agent identities, simulating delegation chains, generating adversarial authorization scope violations, and running these tests across every combination of payment method and country — Pix in Brazil, OXXO in Mexico, PSE in Colombia, boleto in Brazil, and dozens more. The Agentic Testing infrastructure for KYA is a platform in itself. I want to own both the KYA platform and its Agentic Testing infrastructure. For this dual scope, I'm asking for an additional R$30,000-R$50,000 in signing bonus to compensate for the immediate ramp-up intensity, plus a guaranteed options refresh at the 18-month mark tied to KYA platform milestones."*

**6. Competitive Moat Construction**

The KYA Platform is not just an internal tool — it is the competitive moat that determines whether merchants choose EBANX over competitors for agentic commerce:

> *"Here's the strategic reality: dLocal, Mercado Pago, and Adyen are all going to build their own Know Your Agent capabilities. The payments company that ships KYA first, with the best developer experience and the lowest agent-transaction friction, will win the agentic commerce merchant relationships for the next decade. As the KYA Platform Engineer, I am building EBANX's competitive moat. If I build it well, EBANX wins agentic commerce in LatAm. If I build it poorly — or slowly — EBANX loses. For building a competitive moat this consequential, I expect the total compensation to be at the top of EBANX's engineering band. I'm targeting total comp of R$800,000+ in Curitiba, R$950,000+ in São Paulo, or $430,000+ in Austin, with options structured to vest meaningfully in the first two years to align my incentives with rapid KYA platform delivery."*

**7. Cross-Functional KYA Leadership**

The KYA Platform Engineer is not just writing code — they are the technical leader of a cross-functional initiative spanning security, compliance, product, data, and ML:

> *"Building the KYA platform means I'll be the technical point of contact for security (agent threat modeling), compliance (KYA regulatory frameworks across 15+ jurisdictions), product (agent UX and merchant experience), data engineering (agent event pipelines), and ML/AI (agent behavioral models). This cross-functional technical leadership is closer to a Staff or Principal Engineer scope than a standard platform engineer role. I'd like the title and level to reflect this — Senior or Staff KYA Platform Engineer — with compensation at the R$400,000-R$500,000 base range in São Paulo and R$320,000-R$430,000 in Curitiba, plus options at R$300,000-R$380,000 over four years."*

**8. Pre-Liquidity Equity Structuring**

As a private company, EBANX's options carry both upside potential and liquidity risk. The KYA Platform Engineer — who is building the platform most likely to drive valuation growth — should negotiate equity structure, not just quantity:

> *"I believe in EBANX's agentic commerce thesis, and I believe the KYA platform I'd build will be a significant value driver. But as a private company, the options I receive have no guaranteed liquidity timeline. I'd like to discuss three equity structure elements beyond the grant size: first, a secondary sale provision allowing me to sell up to 15% of vested options in any company-organized secondary event. Second, accelerated vesting to a 6-month cliff instead of 12, since the KYA platform ramp-up is immediate. Third, a guaranteed options refresh at 18 months tied to KYA delivery milestones — if I deliver the KYA platform on time, the refresh should be at least 50% of the initial grant. These structural elements make the private-company equity risk more manageable and align my incentives with fast, high-quality KYA delivery."*

### KYA Platform Engineer — Extended Technical Context

**What the KYA Platform Actually Looks Like**

The Know Your Agent platform is a multi-layer system that must operate at payments scale:

- **Agent Registration Service**: Where AI agent providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Amazon, Anthropic, or independent agent developers) register their agents with EBANX, providing agent identity credentials, capability declarations, and compliance certifications. This service must support agent identity standards that will emerge across 15+ regulatory jurisdictions.

- **Consumer Delegation Manager**: Where consumers grant agents permission to transact on their behalf. This includes delegation scope (what the agent can buy, how much it can spend, which payment methods it can use), delegation duration (time-limited vs. standing permissions), and delegation revocation (instant, cross-border, and atomic — revoking a Brazilian consumer's Pix delegation for an agent must not affect the same consumer's boleto delegation for a different agent).

- **Authorization Enforcement Engine**: Real-time service that intercepts every agent-initiated transaction and verifies that the agent is authorized to perform that specific action. Must operate within Pix latency constraints (sub-200ms) and handle the full matrix of payment methods, countries, and authorization scopes.

- **Behavioral Monitoring Pipeline**: Streaming data pipeline that ingests agent transaction events and feeds ML models for anomaly detection. Must distinguish between normal agent behavior (predictable, pattern-adherent) and anomalous behavior (unexpected payment methods, unusual transaction amounts, geographic anomalies).

- **Cross-Jurisdictional Compliance Layer**: Adapts KYA enforcement to the regulatory requirements of each country EBANX operates in. Brazilian KYA rules (aligned with Banco Central and LGPD) will differ from Mexican rules (aligned with Banxico and LFPDPPP), Colombian rules, and the emerging regulatory frameworks in African markets.

- **Merchant KYA API**: The merchant-facing interface that allows Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, Shein, and other merchants to query agent authorization status, receive agent identity metadata with transactions, and configure their own agent acceptance policies.

- **Agentic Testing Sandbox**: A production-like environment where agent providers and merchants can test KYA flows across all payment methods and countries without touching real money or real consumer data.

**Why This Role Commands Premium Compensation**

Three factors converge to make the KYA Platform Engineer one of the most leveraged hires in LatAm fintech:

1. **Scarcity**: There is no established talent pool of "KYA Platform Engineers." Every candidate is assembling skills from adjacent domains — identity platforms, authorization systems, payments infrastructure, compliance engineering. The hiring manager cannot comparison-shop, because the comparison set barely exists.

2. **Impact**: The KYA platform directly determines whether EBANX captures or loses the agentic commerce market. If it ships late, merchants will build their own agent-handling logic or choose a competitor. If it ships with security flaws, a single compromised agent transaction on Pix could cause irreversible financial loss and regulatory exposure across multiple countries.

3. **Timing**: The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study signals that the market is moving now. EBANX cannot afford to hire slowly, lowball on compensation, and risk losing candidates to Nubank, dLocal, or US-based payments companies. The urgency premium is real.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 18-25% uplift on the initial base offer — this is the most leveraged negotiation position at EBANX. For Curitiba, push for R$415,000+ base with R$275,000+ in options (4yr vest). For São Paulo, target R$485,000+ with R$350,000+ in options. For Austin, target $245,000+ with $135,000+ in options. Your accept-at floor: R$320,000 / R$375,000 / $200,000 base respectively, with minimum options of R$175,000 / R$210,000 / $80,000. Beyond the numbers, insist on three structural elements: (1) secondary sale provision for 15% of vested shares in any company-organized event, (2) 6-month cliff instead of 12-month on initial grant, and (3) guaranteed 18-month options refresh of at least 50% of initial grant tied to KYA platform milestones. If the base is absolutely firm, demand a signing bonus of R$50,000-R$80,000 / $20,000-$30,000 to bridge the gap, arguing that the KYA ramp-up intensity justifies immediate compensation beyond base. Walk-away point: if total comp (base + annualized options + bonus) is more than 15% below the midpoint of these ranges, the offer undervalues the strategic importance of this role.
