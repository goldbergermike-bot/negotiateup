**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at EBANX sit at the intersection of merchant needs and platform capabilities, designing the integration architecture that allows global merchants like Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, and Shein to accept local payment methods across 15+ countries in Latin America and Africa. With $1B+ in monthly TPV flowing through EBANX's APIs, every architectural decision a Solutions Architect makes affects transaction success rates, settlement timing, and merchant revenue. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study redefines the Solutions Architect's mandate: merchants will increasingly need to accept transactions initiated by AI agents, not just human consumers. This means designing integration patterns that accommodate agent identity verification, delegated authorization, and new transaction metadata — all while maintaining backward compatibility with existing merchant integrations.

As a private company valued at $3.5B with Advent International and FTV Capital backing, EBANX offers options with 4-year vesting that provide meaningful upside. The Know Your Agent (KYA) transition is deeply relevant to Solutions Architects: they must design the merchant-facing APIs and SDKs that communicate agent identity, authorization scope, and KYA compliance status. Pix integration architecture — including instant payment initiation, QR code generation, and real-time settlement callbacks — must be extended to handle agent-initiated flows. Agentic Testing is also an SA concern: merchants need testing environments where they can validate that their integration handles agent transactions correctly across all supported payment methods and countries. Solutions Architects in Curitiba focus on platform-side design; São Paulo SAs work with Brazil's largest merchants; Austin SAs lead US and global merchant architecture.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

**1. Beyond Borders Merchant Architecture**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study creates an immediate need for Solutions Architects who can design merchant integrations for agentic commerce:

> *"The Beyond Borders study from Feb 10 shows that merchants will need to accept agent-initiated transactions alongside human ones. As a Solutions Architect, I'd be designing the API contracts, webhook schemas, and SDK patterns that allow merchants like Spotify and Shein to distinguish between human and agent transactions, apply appropriate authorization flows, and maintain compliance. I've designed merchant integration architectures at comparable scale. For this agentic-commerce-ready architecture work, I'm targeting R$370,000 base in Curitiba with R$200,000 in options over four years."*

**2. KYA API Design**

Know Your Agent must be exposed to merchants through well-designed APIs. The Solutions Architect who designs this interface shapes the entire ecosystem:

> *"Know Your Agent compliance can't stay internal to EBANX — merchants need APIs that let them verify agent authorization, check KYA status in real time, and receive agent identity metadata with every Pix transaction. Designing these merchant-facing KYA APIs is a Solutions Architect's core responsibility. I've designed financial APIs consumed by thousands of merchants. For owning the KYA merchant API surface, I'm asking for total comp of R$700,000+ in São Paulo, with options reflecting the strategic value of getting this API right."*

**3. Pix Agent Payment Architecture**

Pix is the highest-volume payment method. Extending Pix integration architecture for agent-initiated flows is a differentiated Solutions Architect skill:

> *"Pix agent payments require architectural changes to every layer of the integration: the payment initiation API needs agent identity fields, the QR code flow needs agent delegation metadata, and the settlement callback must distinguish agent from human transactions. I've architected Pix integrations at scale. My ask is $220,000 base in Austin with $95,000 in options over four years."*

**4. Agentic Testing for Merchant Integrations**

Solutions Architects must design merchant-facing Agentic Testing sandboxes that let merchants validate agent transaction handling:

> *"Merchants need to test that their EBANX integration handles agent transactions correctly — across Pix, boleto, OXXO, and every other local payment method in 15+ countries. Designing the Agentic Testing sandbox that merchants use for integration validation is a Solutions Architect responsibility. I want to own merchant-facing Agentic Testing architecture. For this scope, I'm targeting R$375,000 base with R$210,000 in options in Curitiba."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 14-19% uplift on the initial base offer. For Curitiba, push for R$360,000+ base with R$190,000+ in options (4yr vest). For São Paulo, target R$420,000+ with R$250,000+ in options. For Austin, target $215,000+ with $95,000+ in options. Your accept-at floor: R$290,000 / R$340,000 / $180,000 base respectively, with minimum options of R$115,000 / R$145,000 / $55,000. Also negotiate for merchant visit travel budget (SAs need to be on-site with top merchants), technical certification budget, and architecture conference attendance.
