**Negotiation DNA**

At the Staff level, EBANX expects engineers to shape the technical direction of entire product areas — payment routing, merchant integrations, compliance infrastructure, or the emerging agentic commerce platform. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study maps a future in which AI agents will autonomously initiate and complete cross-border purchases across EBANX's 15+ country network spanning Latin America and Africa. Staff engineers who can design the systems architecture to support this future — while maintaining the reliability of $1B+ monthly TPV processing for merchants like Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, and Shein — represent the highest-leverage hire EBANX can make. As a private company valued at $3.5B with Advent International and FTV Capital as backers, the options package at Staff level becomes particularly meaningful, with potential for substantial returns on a liquidity event.

The Know Your Agent (KYA) transition is architecturally a Staff-level problem. Moving from traditional KYC to KYA requires rethinking identity, authorization, and risk models from the ground up. Staff engineers at EBANX must design systems that can verify not just who a customer is, but what an AI agent is authorized to do on their behalf, across multiple jurisdictions with different regulatory frameworks. Pix integration adds complexity: real-time settlement with sub-second finality means the KYA verification layer must be equally fast. Agentic Testing — validating agent behavior across thousands of payment method and country combinations — demands the kind of systems-level thinking that distinguishes Staff engineers. Compensation reflects this: Staff is where EBANX's options grants become substantial enough to rival public-company RSU packages if a liquidity event occurs.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

**1. Beyond Borders Strategic Architecture**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study is your opening move. At Staff level, you are not implementing features — you are defining the architecture that makes agentic commerce possible:

> *"The Beyond Borders study from Feb 10 positions agentic commerce as the defining shift in LatAm cross-border payments. At Staff level, I'd be designing the systems architecture that enables EBANX to process agent-initiated transactions at scale across 15+ countries. This is foundational, multi-year work. I'm targeting R$440,000 base in Curitiba with R$300,000 in options over four years — reflecting the architectural ownership and the pre-liquidity upside of a $3.5B private company."*

**2. KYA Platform Design Authority**

Know Your Agent at the Staff level is a platform design problem spanning identity, authorization, risk, and compliance:

> *"Building Know Your Agent is not an iteration on KYC — it's a new platform. It requires designing agent identity graphs that work across Brazilian CPF, Mexican CURP, and Colombian CC identification systems, all while maintaining Pix-speed settlement times. I've designed multi-jurisdiction identity platforms at comparable scale. To lead KYA platform architecture, I'd like the options grant increased to R$350,000 over four years, and I'd like to discuss secondary sale provisions for vested shares."*

**3. Cross-Border Pix Orchestration**

Staff engineers who can architect cross-border payment orchestration with Pix at the center are exceptionally rare:

> *"EBANX's Pix integration is the fastest settlement rail in your network, and extending Pix-like instant settlement to agentic cross-border flows across 15+ countries is a Staff-level architecture challenge. I've designed payment orchestration systems at comparable throughput. My ask is $255,000 base in Austin with $140,000 in annual options vesting. The Pix orchestration layer for agentic commerce will be a multi-year competitive moat — the comp should reflect that."*

**4. Agentic Testing at Scale**

At Staff level, Agentic Testing is not about writing tests — it is about designing the testing infrastructure that validates agent behavior across EBANX's entire payment network:

> *"Agentic Testing for a payments company operating across 15+ countries with dozens of local payment methods — Pix, boleto, OXXO, PSE, and more — is an unprecedented infrastructure challenge. I want to design the testing platform that gives EBANX confidence that any AI agent can safely execute transactions across the full payment method matrix. This is a Staff-level scope. I'm targeting total comp above R$800,000 in São Paulo, with a meaningful options package reflecting the strategic nature of this work."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 15-22% uplift on the initial base offer. For Curitiba, push for R$430,000+ base with R$280,000+ in options (4yr vest). For São Paulo, target R$500,000+ with R$350,000+ in options. For Austin, target $250,000+ with $140,000+ in options. Your accept-at floor: R$360,000 / R$410,000 / $210,000 base respectively, with minimum options of R$180,000 / R$220,000 / $90,000. At Staff level, also negotiate for secondary sale rights (ability to sell 10-20% of vested options in company-organized secondaries), a guaranteed refresh grant at 24-month review, and explicit scope definition tying your role to the agentic commerce platform.
