**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at EBANX work with one of the richest cross-border payment datasets in the world — transaction flows across 15+ countries in Latin America and Africa, spanning merchants like Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, and Shein, with $1B+ in monthly TPV generating billions of data points on consumer behavior, fraud patterns, payment method preferences, and conversion rates. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study adds a new dimension to this data: agentic commerce, where AI agents autonomously initiate and complete purchases, creating entirely new behavioral patterns that must be modeled, understood, and monetized. Data Scientists who can distinguish between human and agent transaction patterns — and build the models that power EBANX's anti-fraud, risk scoring, and merchant analytics products — carry significant negotiation leverage.

As a private company valued at approximately $3.5B with backing from Advent International and FTV Capital, EBANX provides equity through stock options with a 4-year vesting schedule. The Know Your Agent (KYA) transition depends heavily on data science: building the behavioral models that identify legitimate agent activity versus fraudulent agent impersonation, understanding agent purchasing patterns across Pix and other local payment methods, and quantifying the risk profile of agent-mediated transactions. Agentic Testing also relies on data science — analyzing test results to identify failure modes across the agent-payment method-country matrix. Curitiba's data science team is closest to the engineering and analytics infrastructure; São Paulo offers proximity to merchant analytics stakeholders; Austin data scientists serve US merchant intelligence needs.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

**1. Beyond Borders Agent Behavior Modeling**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study introduces an entirely new class of behavioral data that needs modeling. Frame your statistical and ML skills as essential to this new data paradigm:

> *"The Beyond Borders study from Feb 10 identifies agentic commerce as a transformative force in LatAm payments. This creates a data science problem that doesn't exist yet at most companies: modeling agent behavior, distinguishing legitimate agent purchases from fraudulent ones, and building risk scores for autonomous transactions across 15+ countries. I have experience building behavioral anomaly detection models for financial transactions. Given the novelty of this work, I'm targeting R$295,000 base in Curitiba with R$140,000 in options over four years."*

**2. KYA Risk Modeling**

Know Your Agent compliance depends on statistical models that can verify agent identity and authorization in real time:

> *"Know Your Agent requires a new class of risk models. Traditional KYC models verify that a person is who they claim to be. KYA models need to verify that an agent is authorized to act, that its behavior is within expected bounds, and that the transaction pattern is consistent with the consumer's delegation. I've built real-time scoring models for financial fraud detection. For building EBANX's KYA risk engine, I'm asking for total comp of R$550,000 in São Paulo, with a meaningful options position."*

**3. Pix Transaction Intelligence**

Pix generates real-time, high-frequency transaction data that demands specialized analytics capabilities:

> *"Pix processes billions of instant transactions monthly, and EBANX's Pix data is a goldmine for understanding consumer payment behavior in Brazil. Adding agentic commerce to Pix means I'd be analyzing agent transaction patterns against human baselines in real time. I've worked with comparable real-time payment datasets. My ask is $185,000 base in Austin with $65,000 in options over four years."*

**4. Agentic Testing Analytics**

Agentic Testing generates massive test result datasets that need statistical analysis to identify failure patterns:

> *"Agentic Testing across EBANX's full matrix — dozens of payment methods, 15+ countries, multiple agent frameworks — generates enormous test result datasets. A data scientist needs to identify failure patterns, quantify risk by market and payment method, and build the statistical confidence intervals that determine whether a release is safe for agent-mediated transactions. I want to own Agentic Testing analytics. For this scope, I'm targeting R$305,000 base with R$150,000 in options in Curitiba."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 13-18% uplift on the initial base offer. For Curitiba, push for R$290,000+ base with R$130,000+ in options (4yr vest). For São Paulo, target R$340,000+ with R$170,000+ in options. For Austin, target $180,000+ with $65,000+ in options. Your accept-at floor: R$225,000 / R$265,000 / $150,000 base respectively, with minimum options of R$80,000 / R$100,000 / $40,000. Also negotiate for cloud computing credits for model training (important for private companies that may not have Google/Meta-level infra), conference attendance budget, and access to EBANX's full anonymized transaction dataset for research.
