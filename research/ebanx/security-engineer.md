**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at EBANX protect a payments platform that processes $1B+ in monthly TPV across 15+ countries in Latin America and Africa for merchants including Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, and Shein. The threat surface is extraordinary: cross-border transaction fraud, PCI DSS compliance across multiple jurisdictions, anti-money laundering (AML) monitoring, and nation-state-level adversaries targeting financial infrastructure. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study introduces an entirely new security paradigm: agentic commerce, where AI agents autonomously execute financial transactions. This creates novel attack vectors — agent impersonation, delegation chain hijacking, agent credential theft, and autonomous agent exploit chaining — that no existing security playbook covers. Security Engineers who can threat-model agentic payment flows are among the most scarce and valuable hires in the payments industry.

As a private company valued at $3.5B with Advent International and FTV Capital backing, EBANX offers stock options with 4-year vesting. The transition from KYC to Know Your Agent (KYA) is fundamentally a security initiative: verifying that an AI agent is legitimately authorized to transact on a consumer's behalf, monitoring agent behavior for anomalies, and ensuring that Pix transactions initiated by agents meet the same security standards as human-initiated payments — all in real time, across dozens of payment methods and 15+ regulatory jurisdictions. Agentic Testing from a security perspective means adversarial testing: red-teaming agent authorization flows, fuzzing agent identity tokens, and simulating delegation chain attacks. Curitiba is the security engineering center; São Paulo handles merchant security and compliance relationships; Austin manages US regulatory security requirements and global incident response.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

**1. Beyond Borders Threat Landscape**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study describes agentic commerce adoption that will create entirely new attack surfaces. Use this to frame your security expertise as mission-critical:

> *"The Beyond Borders study from Feb 10 projects rapid agentic commerce adoption across LatAm. From a security perspective, this introduces attack vectors that don't exist in traditional payments: agent credential theft, delegation chain spoofing, autonomous agent exploit chaining, and cross-border agent impersonation. I've done threat modeling for financial systems at comparable scale. Given the novel security surface of agentic commerce, I'm targeting R$310,000 base in Curitiba with R$155,000 in options over four years."*

**2. KYA Security Architecture**

Know Your Agent is the security architecture. The security engineer who designs KYA verification owns the trust foundation of EBANX's agentic commerce platform:

> *"Know Your Agent is fundamentally a security problem. How do you verify that an AI agent presenting a delegation token is legitimately authorized by the consumer? How do you detect a compromised agent making Pix transactions? How do you revoke agent access in real time across 15+ countries without disrupting legitimate transactions? I've designed identity verification and authorization security systems for financial platforms. For building EBANX's KYA security architecture, I'm asking for total comp of R$580,000+ in São Paulo, with an options package reflecting the security-critical nature of this work."*

**3. Pix Security for Agent Transactions**

Pix's instant, irreversible settlement makes security on agent-initiated Pix payments particularly high-stakes:

> *"Pix is instant and irreversible — once a Pix transaction settles, there's no chargeback. When an AI agent initiates a Pix payment, the security verification window is measured in milliseconds, and a false negative means irreversible financial loss. I've built real-time fraud detection for instant payment systems. The security stakes of agent-initiated Pix make this a premium role. My ask is $195,000 base in Austin with $75,000 in options over four years."*

**4. Agentic Adversarial Testing**

Agentic Testing from a security perspective means red-teaming — adversarially testing agent authorization, identity, and transaction flows:

> *"Agentic Testing for security means red-teaming agent flows: attempting delegation chain hijacking, fuzzing agent identity tokens, simulating compromised agents making unauthorized Pix payments across multiple countries. This is adversarial security testing for a threat surface that barely exists yet in the industry. I want to lead EBANX's Agentic Security Testing program. For this scope, I'm targeting R$315,000 base with R$160,000 in options in Curitiba."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 14-19% uplift on the initial base offer. For Curitiba, push for R$305,000+ base with R$150,000+ in options (4yr vest). For São Paulo, target R$360,000+ with R$190,000+ in options. For Austin, target $190,000+ with $75,000+ in options. Your accept-at floor: R$240,000 / R$280,000 / $160,000 base respectively, with minimum options of R$90,000 / R$115,000 / $45,000. Security engineers should also negotiate for security certification budget (CISSP, OSCP, CEH — R$10,000/$3,000 annually), security conference attendance (Black Hat, DEF CON), and explicit incident response compensation (on-call premium for critical security events).
