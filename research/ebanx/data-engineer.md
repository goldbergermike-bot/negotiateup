**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at EBANX build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers analytics, fraud detection, merchant reporting, and regulatory compliance for a platform processing $1B+ in monthly TPV across 15+ countries in Latin America and Africa. Merchants like Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, and Shein depend on EBANX's data pipelines for settlement reconciliation, conversion rate analytics, and chargeback tracking. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study introduces a new data engineering challenge: agentic commerce generates fundamentally different data patterns than human commerce. AI agent transactions create new data schemas (agent identity, delegation chains, authorization scopes), new event streams (agent state changes, permission grants and revocations), and new real-time processing requirements (agent behavior monitoring). Data Engineers who can extend EBANX's data infrastructure to accommodate these agentic data flows are in high demand.

As a private company valued at $3.5B with Advent International and FTV Capital backing, EBANX provides equity through stock options on a 4-year vesting schedule. The Know Your Agent (KYA) transition is data-intensive: KYA requires new data models for agent identity, authorization history, and behavioral telemetry. These data must flow through pipelines that support real-time KYA verification (sub-second latency for Pix transactions) while also feeding batch analytics for compliance reporting across 15+ jurisdictions. Agentic Testing generates its own data engineering needs — test result data must be ingested, transformed, and served to analytics dashboards that track agent behavior across the full payment method and country matrix. Curitiba is the data engineering hub; São Paulo supports merchant analytics data; Austin handles US data infrastructure and global data governance.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

**1. Beyond Borders Data Architecture**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study implies new data schemas and pipelines for agentic commerce. Frame your data engineering skills as essential to this transition:

> *"The Beyond Borders study from Feb 10 shows that agentic commerce will generate entirely new data types: agent identity records, delegation chain events, authorization scope changes, and agent behavioral telemetry. EBANX's data infrastructure needs to ingest, transform, and serve these data streams alongside existing transaction data from $1B+ monthly TPV across 15+ countries. I've built data pipelines at comparable scale for financial platforms. For extending EBANX's data architecture for agentic commerce, I'm targeting R$285,000 base in Curitiba with R$130,000 in options over four years."*

**2. KYA Data Infrastructure**

Know Your Agent requires real-time and batch data pipelines that don't exist today. The data engineer who builds them has outsized impact:

> *"Know Your Agent requires both real-time data pipelines — for sub-second KYA verification on Pix transactions — and batch pipelines for compliance reporting across 15+ jurisdictions. These are new data flows: agent identity verification logs, authorization grant/revoke events, and behavioral anomaly scores. I've built dual real-time/batch data infrastructure for financial compliance systems. For building KYA data infrastructure, I'm asking for total comp of R$520,000 in São Paulo, with a meaningful options position."*

**3. Pix Real-Time Data Streams**

Pix generates high-frequency, real-time transaction data that requires specialized streaming infrastructure:

> *"Pix transactions settle in real time — EBANX's data pipelines must ingest and process Pix events with sub-second latency to support fraud detection, settlement reconciliation, and now KYA agent verification. Adding agentic commerce to Pix means the real-time data volume and schema complexity both increase significantly. I've built real-time payment data streaming infrastructure. My ask is $180,000 base in Austin with $60,000 in options over four years."*

**4. Agentic Testing Data Pipeline**

Agentic Testing generates test result data across the full country-payment-method matrix that must be ingested and made queryable:

> *"Agentic Testing across 15+ countries and dozens of payment methods generates massive test result datasets — agent paths, success/failure rates, latency measurements, and error classifications per country and payment method. Building the data pipeline that ingests test results and serves them to analytics dashboards is a core data engineering challenge. I want to own the Agentic Testing data pipeline. For this scope, I'm targeting R$290,000 base with R$135,000 in options in Curitiba."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 12-17% uplift on the initial base offer. For Curitiba, push for R$280,000+ base with R$120,000+ in options (4yr vest). For São Paulo, target R$325,000+ with R$155,000+ in options. For Austin, target $175,000+ with $60,000+ in options. Your accept-at floor: R$215,000 / R$250,000 / $145,000 base respectively, with minimum options of R$75,000 / R$90,000 / $35,000. Also negotiate for data infrastructure training budget (Spark, Kafka, Flink certifications), cloud data platform credits, and access to EBANX's full data catalog for architectural decision-making.
