**Negotiation DNA**

EBANX's position as the dominant LatAm payments infrastructure company — processing for Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, and Shein across 15+ countries — makes it a rare private-market opportunity with strong liquidity potential. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study revealed that agentic commerce is poised to redefine how cross-border payments flow in Latin America and Africa, creating an immediate demand for Senior Software Engineers who can architect systems that accommodate autonomous AI agents making purchases on behalf of consumers. With the company's $3.5B valuation backed by Advent International and FTV Capital, stock options represent meaningful upside, particularly for senior engineers who join before a potential IPO or secondary liquidity event.

At the Senior level, EBANX expects engineers to own subsystems end-to-end — from Pix integration pipelines to anti-fraud engines to merchant settlement workflows. The transition from traditional KYC to "Know Your Agent" (KYA) compliance adds an entirely new architectural surface area: agent identity verification, delegation chain tracking, and real-time behavioral risk scoring. Curitiba-based seniors benefit from lower cost of living compared to São Paulo while still accessing EBANX's core engineering teams. The Austin office provides USD-denominated compensation with exposure to the US merchant acquisition side. Agentic Testing — the practice of validating that AI-driven agents can safely traverse complex payment flows — is becoming a core competency that EBANX is building from scratch, giving senior engineers with systems design experience significant negotiation leverage.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

**1. Beyond Borders Growth Multiplier**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study positions agentic commerce as the fastest-growing segment in LatAm cross-border payments. As a senior engineer, you should tie your architectural experience to this trajectory:

> *"The Beyond Borders data from Feb 10 makes it clear that agentic commerce will be a defining growth engine for EBANX. I've designed distributed payment systems that process at the scale EBANX operates — $1B+ monthly TPV — and I can architect the agent-aware transaction layer this shift requires. Given the strategic importance of this work, I'm targeting a base of R$300,000 in Curitiba with R$150,000 in options over four years."*

**2. KYA Architecture Ownership**

Know Your Agent is not a feature — it is a platform. Senior engineers who can own its architecture command a premium:

> *"Building the Know Your Agent compliance layer is a platform-level challenge, not a feature toggle. It requires designing agent identity graphs, permission delegation protocols, and real-time anomaly detection — all while maintaining sub-200ms latency on Pix transactions. I've built analogous identity and authorization systems at scale. To own KYA architecture, I'd like to see total compensation at R$500,000+ in São Paulo, with a meaningful options grant reflecting the pre-liquidity upside."*

**3. Pix-Native Systems Design**

EBANX's Pix integration is its crown jewel in Brazil. Senior engineers who understand Pix's real-time settlement architecture are scarce:

> *"Pix processes over 4 billion transactions monthly in Brazil, and EBANX's ability to route agentic commerce through Pix instantly is a competitive advantage. I've built real-time settlement systems with similar throughput and latency requirements. My Pix-native design experience should be reflected in the options grant — I'm looking for R$180,000 in options vesting over four years, up from the R$120,000 in the current offer."*

**4. Agentic Testing Framework Leadership**

At the senior level, you are expected to not just test but to define the Agentic Testing framework. This is a leadership lever:

> *"Agentic Testing for payments is an unsolved problem — there are no industry-standard frameworks for validating that an AI agent can safely execute a cross-border Pix payment on behalf of a consumer across 15+ countries. I want to lead the creation of EBANX's Agentic Testing framework. This is strategic, pre-competitive work that de-risks the entire KYA initiative. For that scope, I'm targeting $195,000 base in Austin with $70,000 in annual options vesting."*

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 15-20% uplift on the initial base offer. For Curitiba, push for R$290,000+ base with R$140,000+ in options (4yr vest). For São Paulo, target R$340,000+ with R$180,000+ in options. For Austin, target $190,000+ with $70,000+ in options. Your accept-at floor: R$240,000 / R$275,000 / $165,000 base respectively, with minimum options of R$100,000 / R$120,000 / $45,000. If the base is firm, negotiate for a secondary sale provision allowing you to sell up to 15% of vested options in any company-organized secondary, or request a $15,000-$25,000 signing bonus to bridge the gap.
