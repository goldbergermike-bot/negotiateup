**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at EBANX shape the experience through which hundreds of millions of consumers across 15+ countries in Latin America and Africa complete cross-border purchases — paying for Spotify subscriptions, Uber rides, AliExpress orders, and Shein fashion with local payment methods like Pix, boleto, OXXO, and PSE. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study introduces a design challenge that has no precedent in payments UX: agentic commerce, where AI agents autonomously navigate checkout flows on behalf of consumers. This means Product Designers must rethink everything from payment method selection to transaction confirmation for non-human actors, while ensuring the consumer retains trust, control, and visibility. EBANX's $1B+ monthly TPV makes every design decision a high-stakes interaction.

As a private company valued at approximately $3.5B with Advent International and FTV Capital backing, EBANX compensates designers through stock options on a 4-year vesting schedule. The Know Your Agent (KYA) transition creates an entirely new design surface: how consumers authorize an AI agent to act on their behalf, how they monitor agent activity in real time, and how they revoke permissions — all within Pix's instant-settlement context. Agentic Testing also has a design dimension — designers must create the dashboards and workflows that allow QA teams to visualize agent behavior across payment methods and markets. Curitiba-based designers work closest to the engineering teams; São Paulo designers often focus on merchant-facing products; Austin designers support US-market and global design system work.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

**1. Beyond Borders UX Innovation**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study describes a future where payment UX must accommodate both human and AI agent actors. Use this to position your design skills as essential:

> *"The Beyond Borders study from Feb 10 describes agentic commerce as a fundamental shift in how consumers interact with payments. Someone needs to design the UX for agent-initiated Pix payments — how the consumer sees what their agent is buying, how they approve or deny transactions in real time, and how the merchant dashboard reflects agent versus human purchases. I've designed payment flows for multi-market products. For this next-generation design challenge, I'm targeting R$260,000 base in Curitiba with R$110,000 in options over four years."*

**2. KYA Authorization Design**

The Know Your Agent consumer experience is a design-first problem — how consumers grant, monitor, and revoke agent permissions:

> *"Know Your Agent starts with design. How does a consumer in Brazil grant an AI agent permission to use their Pix key? What does the agent activity feed look like? How do they revoke access instantly? These are design problems that shape the entire KYA platform. I've designed trust-and-safety UX for financial products. For owning KYA authorization design, I'm asking for total comp of R$450,000 in São Paulo, with an options grant that reflects the strategic importance of getting agent UX right."*

**3. Multi-Market Pix Design System**

Designing for Pix while maintaining consistency across 15+ countries and dozens of payment methods is a rare design skill:

> *"Pix is instant, irreversible, and the most-used payment method in Brazil. Designing agent-initiated Pix flows requires real-time feedback loops, instant confirmation states, and error handling that accounts for autonomous agents — not just human users. I've built design systems for real-time financial products across multiple markets. My ask is $165,000 base in Austin with a signing bonus of $10,000."*

**4. Agentic Testing Visualization**

Designers are needed to create the dashboards that make Agentic Testing legible to QA, engineering, and compliance teams:

> *"Agentic Testing generates enormous amounts of behavioral data — agent paths through checkout, payment method selection patterns, error rates by country and method. Someone needs to design the visualization layer that makes this data actionable for QA and compliance teams. I want to own Agentic Testing visualization. For this scope, I'm targeting R$270,000 base with R$120,000 in options over four years in Curitiba."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 12-16% uplift on the initial base offer. For Curitiba, push for R$255,000+ base with R$100,000+ in options (4yr vest). For São Paulo, target R$300,000+ with R$130,000+ in options. For Austin, target $165,000+ with $50,000+ in options. Your accept-at floor: R$200,000 / R$235,000 / $135,000 base respectively, with minimum options of R$60,000 / R$75,000 / $30,000. Also negotiate for design tool budget (Figma Enterprise, prototyping tools), annual design conference attendance, and user research travel budget to visit consumers in key LatAm markets.
