**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at EBANX coordinate the delivery of cross-border payment capabilities across engineering, product, compliance, and merchant-facing teams — orchestrating programs that span 15+ countries in Latin America and Africa and touch merchants like Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, and Shein. With $1B+ in monthly TPV, program delays translate directly into lost revenue and merchant churn, making the TPM's delivery velocity a high-leverage skill. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study introduces the largest cross-functional program EBANX has ever undertaken: agentic commerce. Delivering agent-aware payment capabilities requires coordinating engineering (building the infrastructure), product (defining the experience), compliance (establishing KYA frameworks), and merchant relations (integrating partners) — a program management challenge of considerable complexity.

As a private company valued at $3.5B with Advent International and FTV Capital backing, EBANX offers options with 4-year vesting. The Know Your Agent (KYA) program is the kind of multi-quarter, cross-functional initiative that defines a TPM's career. It touches Pix integration (engineering must extend instant settlement for agent transactions), compliance (legal must define KYA frameworks across 15+ jurisdictions), merchant integration (Solutions Architects must update APIs), and quality assurance (Agentic Testing must be established as a release gate). A TPM who can drive KYA from strategy to launch across all these workstreams commands premium compensation. Curitiba TPMs are closest to engineering execution; São Paulo TPMs coordinate merchant-facing programs; Austin TPMs manage US and global program cadences.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

**1. Beyond Borders Program Leadership**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study defines a multi-quarter program that needs a TPM to drive it. Position yourself as the program leader:

> *"The Beyond Borders study from Feb 10 lays out an agentic commerce roadmap that is the most complex cross-functional program EBANX will undertake in the next two years. It spans engineering infrastructure, KYA compliance across 15+ jurisdictions, Pix integration changes, merchant API updates, and the stand-up of Agentic Testing. I've led payments programs at comparable complexity. To drive the agentic commerce program, I'm targeting R$320,000 base in Curitiba with R$155,000 in options over four years."*

**2. KYA Cross-Functional Program Delivery**

Know Your Agent is the program. The TPM who owns KYA delivery owns EBANX's most strategic initiative:

> *"Know Your Agent is not a feature — it's a multi-quarter program spanning engineering, compliance, product, design, and merchant relations across every country EBANX operates in. Someone needs to own the program plan, manage dependencies, de-risk the critical path, and report to executive leadership. That's a TPM's job. I've delivered multi-jurisdiction compliance programs for payments companies. For owning KYA program delivery, I'm asking for total comp of R$600,000+ in São Paulo, with an options package reflecting the program's strategic importance."*

**3. Pix Agent Integration Program**

Extending Pix for agent transactions is a program in itself — coordinating with Banco Central, engineering, and merchants:

> *"Extending EBANX's Pix integration for agent-initiated transactions touches Banco Central coordination, engineering changes to the settlement pipeline, merchant API updates, and compliance review. This is a discrete program within the broader KYA initiative and needs dedicated TPM ownership. I have experience managing payment rail integration programs with central bank dependencies. My ask is $200,000 base in Austin with $80,000 in options over four years."*

**4. Agentic Testing Program Establishment**

Standing up Agentic Testing as an organizational capability is a program management challenge — defining processes, tools, and release gates:

> *"Agentic Testing doesn't exist yet at EBANX. Standing it up means defining the testing framework, building the test environments, establishing release gates, training QA teams, and coordinating with engineering and product to embed agent testing into the development lifecycle. This is a greenfield program. I want to drive the Agentic Testing program establishment. For this scope, I'm targeting R$325,000 base with R$160,000 in options in Curitiba."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 13-18% uplift on the initial base offer. For Curitiba, push for R$315,000+ base with R$150,000+ in options (4yr vest). For São Paulo, target R$370,000+ with R$190,000+ in options. For Austin, target $195,000+ with $75,000+ in options. Your accept-at floor: R$250,000 / R$290,000 / $165,000 base respectively, with minimum options of R$90,000 / R$115,000 / $45,000. Also negotiate for program management tooling budget, cross-country travel budget (TPMs need to be in-market to unblock programs), and explicit scope commitment tying your role to the KYA program for the first 18 months.
