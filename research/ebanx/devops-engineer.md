**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at EBANX are the guardians of a payments infrastructure that processes $1B+ in monthly TPV across 15+ countries in Latin America and Africa, serving merchants like Spotify, Uber, AliExpress, and Shein. Downtime is measured not in user frustration but in lost merchant revenue and regulatory exposure — making reliability, deployment velocity, and infrastructure observability existential concerns. The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study adds a new infrastructure dimension: agentic commerce workloads, where AI agents generate transaction patterns that are fundamentally different from human traffic — potentially burstier, more geographically distributed, and requiring different scaling characteristics. DevOps engineers who can instrument, scale, and secure infrastructure for both human and agent-driven payment flows are in exceptional demand.

As a private company valued at $3.5B with Advent International and FTV Capital as investors, EBANX compensates DevOps engineers through stock options with 4-year vesting. The Know Your Agent (KYA) transition introduces new infrastructure requirements: agent identity verification services must operate at Pix latency (sub-second), KYA compliance audit logs must be immutable and regionally stored per local data sovereignty laws, and Agentic Testing environments must replicate the full 15+ country payment method matrix without touching production. Curitiba hosts the core infrastructure team; São Paulo supports merchant-facing service reliability; Austin manages US-region infrastructure and global disaster recovery coordination.

### Agentic Commerce — The Know Your Agent Premium

**1. Beyond Borders Infrastructure Scaling**

The Feb 10, 2026 Beyond Borders study projects new agentic commerce traffic patterns that will challenge existing infrastructure assumptions. Use this to frame your infra scaling expertise:

> *"The Beyond Borders study from Feb 10 suggests agentic commerce will introduce traffic patterns that differ fundamentally from human browsing and purchasing behavior. AI agents can generate burst transaction volumes across multiple countries simultaneously. EBANX's infrastructure needs to scale for this new load profile while maintaining sub-second Pix settlement latency. I've designed auto-scaling payment infrastructure at comparable throughput. For building agent-ready infrastructure, I'm targeting R$275,000 base in Curitiba with R$120,000 in options over four years."*

**2. KYA Infrastructure Requirements**

Know Your Agent compliance services must operate at payment-speed latency and comply with multi-jurisdiction data residency rules:

> *"Know Your Agent is an infrastructure challenge as much as it is a compliance one. KYA verification services need to run at Pix speeds — sub-200ms — and the audit logs must be stored in compliance with data sovereignty regulations across 15+ countries. I've built multi-region, compliance-aware infrastructure at this scale. For owning KYA infrastructure, I'm asking for total comp of R$480,000 in São Paulo, with the options grant reflecting the pre-liquidity opportunity."*

**3. Pix Reliability at Scale**

Pix is a real-time, zero-tolerance-for-downtime payment rail. DevOps engineers who can maintain four-nines reliability on Pix integrations are scarce:

> *"EBANX's Pix integration handles real-time settlement with zero tolerance for downtime — every failed Pix transaction is a lost sale for merchants like Spotify and Uber. I've maintained four-nines availability on real-time payment infrastructure at comparable scale. As agentic commerce adds new load patterns to Pix, this reliability expertise becomes even more critical. My ask is $175,000 base in Austin with $55,000 in options over four years."*

**4. Agentic Testing Environments**

Agentic Testing requires production-like environments that replicate the full payment method matrix without touching live systems:

> *"Agentic Testing across 15+ countries with dozens of payment methods requires test environments that faithfully replicate production — including Pix sandbox, boleto simulation, OXXO test endpoints, and more — without ever touching real money. Building and maintaining these environments at scale is a core DevOps challenge. I want to own the Agentic Testing infrastructure. For this scope, I'm targeting R$280,000 base with R$125,000 in options in Curitiba."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 12-17% uplift on the initial base offer. For Curitiba, push for R$270,000+ base with R$115,000+ in options (4yr vest). For São Paulo, target R$315,000+ with R$140,000+ in options. For Austin, target $170,000+ with $55,000+ in options. Your accept-at floor: R$215,000 / R$250,000 / $145,000 base respectively, with minimum options of R$70,000 / R$85,000 / $35,000. Also negotiate for on-call compensation (important — EBANX is a 24/7 payment processor), infrastructure certification budget (AWS/GCP/Azure), and SRE conference attendance.
