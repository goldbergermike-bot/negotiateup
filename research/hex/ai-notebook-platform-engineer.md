### AI Notebook Platform Engineer | Hex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Growth-Stage Equity + AI Premium | Data Analytics Platform Pioneer | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | 2026 Focus: Next-Gen AI-Native Notebook Architecture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $200K–$260K | $200K–$360K | 10–15% | $280K–$420K |
| New York | $195K–$255K | $200K–$360K | 10–15% | $275K–$410K |
| London | £152K–£198K | £150K–£270K | 10–15% | £213K–£320K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The AI Notebook Platform Engineer is Hex's signature role — the position that defines the core product and competitive differentiation. You build the notebook execution engine, the AI integration layer, the collaborative editing infrastructure, and the data warehouse query pipeline that together form the AI-native analytics platform. This isn't just building features on a platform; it's building the platform itself. Every line of code you write shapes how thousands of data teams experience analytics, and every architectural decision you make determines whether Hex can out-execute Databricks, Snowflake, and the wave of AI-native startups entering the analytics space.

The AI Notebook Platform Engineer combines deep frontend engineering (real-time collaborative editing, reactive notebook cells, visualization rendering), backend systems design (query execution, caching, multi-tenant isolation), and AI systems integration (LLM orchestration, streaming inference, context-aware code generation). Engineers with this full breadth are exceptionally rare — most are specialists in one layer. Hex pays a significant premium for engineers who can work across the entire notebook stack, and the 2026 AI push makes this role more critical and more scarce than ever.

### Next-Gen AI-Native Notebook Architecture Lever
Hex's 2026 vision is rebuilding the notebook paradigm from the ground up around AI — not just adding AI features to a traditional notebook, but creating an entirely new analytics experience where AI is the primary interaction modality. AI Notebook Platform Engineers will architect streaming AI cells that execute in real-time, context-aware code generation that understands the entire notebook state, AI-powered data exploration that automatically generates analysis paths, and collaborative AI workflows where multiple users interact with shared AI assistants.

This is the highest-leverage technical work at Hex: if the AI-native notebook architecture is fast, reliable, and magical, Hex wins the analytics market. If it's slow, unreliable, or superficial, Hex loses to Databricks. The strategic importance of this architecture work — combined with the extreme scarcity of engineers who can build it — justifies compensation at the very top of Hex's bands, with the AI premium applied.

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Scarcity Premium:** "Full-stack platform engineers who can build across the notebook execution engine, AI integration layer, and collaborative infrastructure are extraordinarily rare. This is Hex's defining role, and the compensation should reflect that scarcity. I'm looking for $255K base and $350K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Platform Architecture Premium:** "I've architected AI-integrated platform systems at [company] — streaming inference, context-aware generation, and real-time collaboration with AI. That specific experience maps directly to Hex's notebook architecture vision. I need $260K base."
3. **Competing Platform Engineer Offers:** "Figma is offering Staff Engineer at $260K / $450K RSU and Databricks Staff Platform at $265K / $420K RSU — both liquid. Hex's AI notebook vision is more compelling, but I need $255K base, $350K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $50K signing bonus."
4. **Platform = Product Moat:** "The notebook platform architecture is Hex's entire product moat. My architectural decisions will determine the user experience for millions of data professionals. That foundational impact justifies top-of-band compensation: $260K base and $360K equity/4yr."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Hex's AI-native notebook is the most exciting platform architecture challenge in data tooling — and it's the exact intersection of my expertise: real-time collaborative systems, AI integration architecture, and data platform infrastructure. I'm holding a Figma Staff offer at $260K / $450K RSU and a Databricks Staff Platform offer at $265K / $420K RSU — both liquid, both compelling. To choose Hex, I need $255K base, $350K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $50K signing bonus. The AI notebook architecture is Hex's defining technical challenge, and I'm the engineer who can build it. At $255K base, I sign immediately and dedicate my career to making Hex's notebook the default AI analytics platform. My floor is $235K — below that, the liquid equity at Figma and Databricks represents too large a financial sacrifice, even for a role this compelling."
