### Security Engineer | Hex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity | Data Analytics Platform Pioneer | 2026 Focus: Enterprise Data Security & AI Safety

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $175K–$225K | $130K–$240K | 5–10% | $228K–$315K |
| New York | $170K–$220K | $130K–$240K | 5–10% | $223K–$308K |
| London | £133K–£171K | £98K–£180K | 5–10% | £173K–£238K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Hex protect one of the most sensitive data surfaces in enterprise software — the platform where companies connect their production data warehouses and run analytics on their most confidential business data. Hex's customers trust the platform with direct access to Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift warehouses containing financial data, customer PII, and proprietary business metrics. A security breach at Hex isn't just a data leak — it's a breach of every customer's data warehouse simultaneously. This makes Security Engineers at Hex among the most business-critical hires in the company.

The enterprise data security mandate creates strong negotiation leverage. Hex cannot sell to Fortune 500 companies without SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA compliance pathways, and robust data isolation. Security Engineers who have built enterprise security programs at data platform companies or achieved compliance certifications are in high demand and short supply. Your security expertise directly enables Hex's enterprise revenue.

### Enterprise Data Security & AI Safety Lever
Hex's 2026 enterprise push and AI feature expansion create a dual security mandate: traditional data platform security (warehouse connection encryption, data isolation, access controls, compliance) combined with emerging AI security challenges (prompt injection protection, AI output data leakage prevention, model access control, AI feature audit logging). Security Engineers who understand both data infrastructure security and AI system security threats are exceptionally rare.

Enterprise customers increasingly require AI-specific security certifications and guarantees before adopting AI-powered analytics platforms. Security Engineers who can build and certify AI security frameworks — ensuring that Magic and other AI features don't inadvertently expose sensitive data — are directly enabling Hex's enterprise AI adoption. This dual mandate justifies a significant compensation premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Enterprise Revenue Enablement:** "Every enterprise deal Hex closes depends on the security posture I build and maintain. SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA readiness, and data isolation are table stakes for Fortune 500 customers. That revenue enablement justifies $220K base and $230K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Security Specialization:** "AI security — prompt injection, data leakage through AI outputs, model access control — is a nascent field with almost no available talent. I bring this expertise plus traditional data platform security. I need $225K base for this rare combination."
3. **Data Platform Security Scarcity:** "Security engineers with data warehouse security experience are extremely scarce. Snowflake is offering $220K / $260K RSU for a similar role. I need $220K base and $240K equity to choose Hex."
4. **Compliance Acceleration:** "I've led SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA compliance programs at [company]. I can accelerate Hex's enterprise compliance roadmap by 6+ months. That speed-to-market for enterprise deals justifies a $30K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Hex's security challenge is fascinating — protecting enterprise data warehouse access while building AI security for Magic and other AI features. I'm holding a Snowflake offer at $220K / $260K RSU and a CrowdStrike offer at $215K / $230K RSU. To choose Hex, I need $220K base, $235K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $220K base, I commit and start building the enterprise security program. My floor is $205K — below that, the liquid equity at public security companies wins."
