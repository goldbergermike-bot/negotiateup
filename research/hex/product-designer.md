**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Hex shape how thousands of data professionals experience analytics — from notebook cell interactions and data visualization to AI-powered features and collaborative workflows. Hex's design craft is a core competitive advantage: the product is beloved by data teams precisely because it feels intentional, polished, and thoughtfully designed. Designers here work at the intersection of complex data workflows and consumer-grade UX, which requires a rare combination of technical understanding and design intuition.

Hex competes for design talent against Figma, Linear, Notion, and other design-forward product companies. Designers who understand data workflows and can create elegant interfaces for technically complex features are scarce. Your portfolio of data tool design work — or any complex technical product design — is strong negotiation leverage. Hex needs designers who can make AI features feel natural and trustworthy, not just functional.

### AI-Native Data Experience Design Lever
Hex's 2026 design challenge is defining what AI-native analytics looks like — designing interactions where AI assistance feels seamless rather than intrusive, where natural language queries coexist with SQL cells, and where AI-generated insights earn user trust through transparency and accuracy. This is uncharted territory in analytics UX, and the designers who define these patterns will shape the entire industry.

Product Designers with experience designing AI-powered interfaces — especially in data or developer tools — hold significant leverage. The design patterns for AI-native analytics don't exist yet; Hex needs designers who can invent them. If you've designed AI interactions, conversational UIs, or trust-building interfaces for automated systems, emphasize this expertise heavily in negotiations.

**Global Levers**
1. **Data Tool Design Specialization:** "Designing for data professionals requires deep domain understanding — I know the workflows, the pain points, and the mental models. I've designed data tools at [company]. That specialization commands $195K base and $180K equity/4yr."
2. **AI UX Design Premium:** "Designing AI-native interactions is the hardest UX challenge in tech right now. I've shipped AI-powered interfaces at [company] and understand how to build trust, transparency, and delight into AI features. I need $200K base."
3. **Competing Design-Forward Offers:** "Figma is offering $190K base / $220K RSU and Linear is at $185K / $190K RSU. Both are design-led companies with liquid equity. I need $195K base and $190K equity/4yr to choose Hex."
4. **Design Craft = Product Moat:** "Hex's design quality is a core competitive advantage — it's why data teams choose Hex over Databricks notebooks. My design work directly protects and extends that moat. I'd like $195K base and a $20K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm passionate about designing for data teams, and Hex's design craft is the best in the analytics space — I want to help define what AI-native analytics looks like. I'm holding a Figma offer at $190K / $220K RSU and a Linear offer at $185K / $190K RSU. To choose Hex, I need $195K base, $185K equity/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $195K base, I'm in. My floor is $180K — below that, the liquid equity at Figma is too compelling."
