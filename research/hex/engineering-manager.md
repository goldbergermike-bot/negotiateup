### Engineering Manager | Hex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Significant Growth-Stage Equity | Data Analytics Platform Pioneer | 2026 Focus: Scaling AI-Native Engineering Teams

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $210K–$265K | $200K–$360K | 10–15% | $285K–$420K |
| New York | $205K–$260K | $200K–$360K | 10–15% | $280K–$410K |
| London | £160K–£200K | £150K–£270K | 10–15% | £215K–£320K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Hex lead the teams building the AI-native analytics platform — managing 6-12 engineers across notebook infrastructure, AI features, data warehouse integrations, or collaborative editing. Hex's EM role is deeply technical: you're expected to understand the architecture, participate in design reviews, and make informed trade-offs between shipping velocity and platform reliability. This is not a process-management role; it's a technical leadership position with people management responsibilities.

At a growth-stage company like Hex, EMs are also organizational architects — building the team structures, hiring processes, and engineering culture that will scale from 50 to 200+ engineers. The EM-to-engineer ratio is low, meaning each EM has outsized organizational impact. Companies like Figma, Notion, and Linear compete for this profile of technical-EM-at-a-product-led-growth-company, and their compensation packages provide strong negotiation benchmarks.

### Scaling AI-Native Engineering Teams Lever
Hex's 2026 growth plan requires rapidly scaling its engineering organization to build AI features while maintaining the high-quality, craft-oriented culture that makes the product great. Engineering Managers who can hire and retain top AI and data platform engineers — while shipping ambitiously — are essential to this growth. EMs with experience scaling engineering teams at developer tools or data platform companies command a significant premium.

The AI-native dimension adds complexity: EMs must build teams that combine traditional software engineering with ML/AI expertise, create processes for shipping AI features safely, and establish quality bars for AI-powered user experiences. If you have managed teams shipping AI features in production, that experience is directly relevant to Hex's most important organizational challenge.

**Global Levers**
1. **Org-Building Premium:** "I'm not just managing a team — I'm building the engineering organization that will take Hex from Series C to IPO. I've scaled engineering teams from 20 to 80+ at [previous company]. That org-building experience commands $260K base and $340K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Team Leadership Scarcity:** "EMs who can build and lead teams shipping AI features in production are rare. I've managed AI-feature teams at [company] and know how to balance ML experimentation with shipping velocity. I need $255K base to reflect this scarcity."
3. **Competing EM Offers:** "Figma is offering $250K base / $400K RSU and Notion is at $245K base / $350K RSU — both liquid. To choose Hex, I need $260K base, $350K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus."
4. **Retention and Hiring Multiplier:** "The engineers I hire and retain create 10x my individual output. Investing in my compensation with $350K equity/4yr and guaranteed refreshes ensures I stay and build for the long term."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've scaled engineering organizations at [growth-stage company] and managed teams shipping AI features to production — that's exactly what Hex needs for its 2026 growth plan. I'm holding a Figma offer at $250K / $400K RSU and a Databricks EM offer at $255K / $380K RSU. To choose Hex, I need $260K base, $350K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $40K signing bonus. At $260K base, I sign and start building your AI engineering org. My floor is $240K — below that, the liquid equity at Figma is the rational choice."
