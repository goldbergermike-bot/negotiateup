### Data Scientist | Hex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity | Data Analytics Platform Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI-Powered Analytics Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$215K | $120K–$220K | 5–10% | $210K–$295K |
| New York | $160K–$210K | $120K–$220K | 5–10% | $205K–$288K |
| London | £125K–£163K | £90K–£165K | 5–10% | £158K–£220K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Hex occupy a unique dual role: they build the AI and analytics features that power the product while also using Hex's own platform to drive internal data-informed decisions. This means you are simultaneously a product engineer and the most demanding internal user of the platform. Hex values Data Scientists who can translate statistical rigor into product features — building recommendation engines, usage analytics models, and the AI-powered insight generation systems that differentiate Hex from traditional notebook tools.

Because Hex's customers are data teams, Data Scientists here must deeply understand the end user. Your experience doing hands-on analytics and ML work is the empathy engine that drives great product decisions. This domain expertise — actually doing data science with data tools — is rare and valuable. Companies like Databricks, Mode, and Observable also value this profile, giving you competing offer leverage.

### AI-Powered Analytics Intelligence Lever
Hex's 2026 push into AI-powered analytics intelligence means Data Scientists will build the ML models behind automated insights, anomaly detection, natural language data exploration, and intelligent chart recommendations. These features transform Hex from a notebook tool into an AI analytics co-pilot — a strategic priority that directly impacts enterprise adoption and revenue growth.

Data Scientists who can build production ML models that generate reliable, explainable analytics insights are in extremely high demand. If you have experience with NLP for data querying, time-series anomaly detection, or recommendation systems for analytics workflows, you bring exactly the skills Hex needs for its 2026 AI analytics push. This specialization commands a premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Product-Building Data Scientist Premium:** "I don't just analyze data — I build data products. My experience shipping ML-powered analytics features at [previous company] maps directly to Hex's AI roadmap. I'm looking for $210K base and $210K equity/4yr."
2. **Data Tool Domain Expertise:** "I've spent my career using and building data tools — I am Hex's target user and also the person building features for them. That dual expertise is rare. I need $205K base to reflect this domain premium."
3. **Competing Offer from Data Platform:** "Databricks is offering $215K base / $240K RSU for a similar Data Scientist role. I prefer Hex's product vision, but I need $210K base and $220K equity/4yr to close the gap."
4. **AI Analytics Feature Impact:** "The AI-powered insight features I'll build will directly drive enterprise adoption and ARR growth. That revenue impact justifies $215K base and a $25K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Hex's vision for AI-native analytics is exactly where I want to apply my skills — I've shipped ML-powered data products to thousands of users and I deeply understand the data team workflow. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $215K / $240K RSU and a Mode Analytics offer at $195K / $160K equity. To choose Hex, I need $210K base, $215K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $210K base, I commit immediately. My floor is $195K — below that, Databricks' liquid equity wins."
