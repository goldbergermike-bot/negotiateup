**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Hex orchestrate the cross-functional execution of Hex's most complex initiatives — coordinating engineering, product, design, data science, and go-to-market teams to ship AI features, platform migrations, enterprise integrations, and security compliance programs on time and at quality. At a growth-stage company like Hex, TPMs are organizational force multipliers: you create the structure and cadence that enables a fast-moving startup to execute like a well-oiled machine without introducing bureaucratic overhead.

Hex's TPM role is deeply technical — you must understand data infrastructure, AI system architecture, and notebook platform internals well enough to identify risks, resolve cross-team dependencies, and make informed scope trade-offs. This is not a project management role; it's a technical leadership position that requires both systems thinking and execution rigor. Companies like Databricks, Stripe, and Figma compete for TPMs with this technical depth.

**Level Mapping:** Hex TPM = Google L5 TPM = Meta TPM IC5 = Databricks TPM = Stripe TPM = Figma TPM

### AI Feature Launch Orchestration Lever
Hex's 2026 roadmap is heavily AI-focused, and AI feature launches are uniquely complex: they require coordinating ML model deployments, backend API changes, frontend UX updates, security reviews, enterprise rollout strategies, and marketing announcements — all synchronized across a compressed timeline. TPMs who can orchestrate AI feature launches — managing the unique risks of ML systems (model quality, latency, safety) alongside traditional software delivery — are in high demand.

The enterprise dimension adds further complexity: AI features must be rolled out with careful enterprise customer communication, compliance verification, and SLA guarantees. TPMs who have managed enterprise AI feature launches at data platform or developer tools companies bring directly applicable experience that Hex needs to execute its 2026 AI strategy.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Launch Complexity Premium:** "AI feature launches are 3x more complex than traditional software launches — model quality verification, safety reviews, enterprise rollout coordination. I've managed these at [company]. That AI TPM expertise commands $210K base and $200K equity/4yr."
2. **Organizational Multiplier Effect:** "I'm a force multiplier — my program management enables 20+ engineers to ship faster and with fewer coordination failures. That leverage justifies $215K base and a $25K signing bonus."
3. **Competing TPM Offers:** "Stripe is offering $210K base / $250K RSU and Databricks is at $205K / $220K RSU. I need $210K base and $210K equity/4yr to choose Hex over liquid public-company equity."
4. **Enterprise Compliance Program Leadership:** "I've led SOC 2 and enterprise security compliance programs at [company]. Accelerating Hex's enterprise compliance by 6 months directly enables millions in enterprise ARR. That impact justifies $215K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Hex's 2026 AI roadmap needs a TPM who can orchestrate complex AI feature launches across engineering, product, and enterprise go-to-market — and I've done exactly that at [company]. I'm holding a Stripe offer at $210K / $250K RSU and a Databricks offer at $205K / $220K RSU. To choose Hex, I need $210K base, $205K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $210K base, I'm committed to building the program management infrastructure that lets Hex ship AI features at enterprise quality. My floor is $195K — below that, Stripe's liquid equity and operational maturity is the rational choice."
