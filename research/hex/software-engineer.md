**Negotiation DNA**
Hex Software Engineers build the core platform that powers collaborative data notebooks used by data teams at companies like Notion, Brex, and Loom. Hex's product sits at the intersection of data analytics, visualization, and AI-assisted coding — engineers here ship features that thousands of data professionals rely on daily. The engineering culture prizes full-stack versatility, deep product intuition, and the ability to build elegant interfaces on top of complex data infrastructure. Hex competes for talent against Databricks, dbt Labs, and Mode Analytics, giving you meaningful leverage in negotiations.

### AI-Native Notebook Platform Lever
Hex's 2026 strategy centers on making its notebook the default AI-native analytics environment — embedding LLM-powered code generation, natural language querying, and automated insight extraction directly into the collaborative workflow. Software Engineers who can build reliable, low-latency AI integrations into the notebook experience are essential to this vision. This means engineers with experience in streaming architectures, LLM API orchestration, or real-time collaborative editing hold outsized leverage.

The AI-native push also means Hex is competing directly with Databricks Notebooks, Google Colab, and emerging AI-native analytics startups for engineering talent. If you have experience building AI-powered developer tools or data platforms, emphasize this in negotiations — Hex needs to pay a premium to keep talent from jumping to better-funded competitors in the AI tooling space.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Tooling Market Premium:** "The AI-powered analytics space is the hottest segment in data infrastructure right now. Databricks is offering $185K base for similar notebook platform work. I need Hex to be competitive at $200K base to make the growth-stage equity trade-off worthwhile."
2. **Full-Stack Data Platform Scarcity:** "Engineers who can build across the stack — from React-based notebook UIs to query execution engines — are rare. I bring both frontend craft and backend data systems depth. I'm looking for $205K base and $200K equity/4yr."
3. **Growth-Stage Equity Upside Framing:** "Hex's growth trajectory in the AI analytics space is compelling. I'd like to increase my equity grant to $220K/4yr with a one-year cliff and the possibility of refresh grants tied to product milestones."
4. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have an offer from dbt Labs at $195K base with $180K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. Hex's product vision excites me more, but I need $200K base and $210K equity to offset the liquidity risk of private shares."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about Hex's vision for AI-native analytics notebooks — this is where data tooling is going, and I want to build it. I'm currently holding offers from Databricks at $185K base / $250K RSU and dbt Labs at $195K base / $180K RSU. Both are strong and liquid. To choose Hex, I need $205K base, $220K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus to bridge the liquidity gap. At $205K base, I sign this week. My floor is $190K — below that, the public-company equity packages are too strong to leave."
