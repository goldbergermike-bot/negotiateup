### Data Engineer | Hex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity | Data Analytics Platform Pioneer | 2026 Focus: Warehouse-Native AI Integrations

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$205K | $110K–$200K | 5–10% | $200K–$275K |
| New York | $155K–$200K | $110K–$200K | 5–10% | $195K–$268K |
| London | £120K–£155K | £82K–£150K | 5–10% | £150K–£205K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Hex build and optimize the data infrastructure layer that powers the notebook platform — query execution engines, warehouse connectors, caching systems, and the data pipeline integrations that make Hex feel instantaneous for users querying terabytes of data. Because Hex's product is a data platform, Data Engineers here are not internal support roles — they are core product engineers whose work directly shapes the user experience and competitive differentiation.

Hex competes for Data Engineers against Snowflake, Databricks, Fivetran, and dbt Labs — all of which offer strong compensation and liquid equity. Your warehouse expertise, SQL optimization skills, and understanding of modern data stack architecture are directly applicable to Hex's core product. Use competing offers from these companies as your primary leverage.

**Level Mapping:** Hex Data Engineer = Google L4 Data Engineer = Snowflake Data Engineer II = Databricks Data Engineer = dbt Labs Senior Analytics Engineer

### Warehouse-Native AI Integrations Lever
Hex's 2026 strategy includes building deep AI integrations that work natively with cloud data warehouses — enabling users to ask natural language questions that translate into optimized SQL, generate dbt models from descriptions, and automatically surface insights from warehouse data. Data Engineers who understand both warehouse internals and AI query generation are critical to this initiative.

If you have experience with Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift internals — and especially if you understand how LLMs can generate and optimize SQL — you hold significant leverage. Hex needs engineers who can bridge the gap between AI capabilities and warehouse performance reality. Emphasize this hybrid skill set to push toward the top of the compensation band.

**Global Levers**
1. **Warehouse Expertise Premium:** "I have deep expertise in Snowflake and BigQuery optimization — the exact warehouse platforms Hex's customers use most. Snowflake is offering $195K base for a similar data engineering role. I need $200K base to make the startup equity trade-off work."
2. **AI + Data Infrastructure Hybrid:** "Engineers who understand both data warehouse internals and LLM-based query generation are extremely rare. I bring both. I'm looking for $205K base and $190K equity/4yr to reflect this hybrid skill set."
3. **Modern Data Stack Network Effect:** "I come from the dbt/Snowflake ecosystem and bring deep relationships with data teams at [enterprise customers]. That network accelerates Hex's go-to-market. I'd like $195K base and a $25K signing bonus."
4. **Growth-Stage Equity Upside:** "Hex is positioned to be the AI-native layer on top of the modern data stack — that's a massive TAM. I'd like $200K equity/4yr with a one-year cliff to be meaningfully invested in that growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Hex is building exactly where I want to work — at the intersection of data warehouses and AI-native analytics. I'm holding offers from Snowflake at $195K base / $220K RSU and Fivetran at $185K base / $180K RSU, both liquid. To choose Hex, I need $200K base, $195K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $200K, I'm in. My floor is $185K base — below that, the liquid equity at Snowflake is the rational choice."
