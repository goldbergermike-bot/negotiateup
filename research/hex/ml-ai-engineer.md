**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Hex build the intelligence layer that transforms the notebook from a code editor into an AI-powered analytics co-pilot. You own Magic — Hex's AI code generation system — and the broader AI feature suite: natural language data querying, automated chart recommendations, intelligent cell suggestions, and AI-powered data storytelling. This is the role that defines whether Hex wins the AI analytics race against Databricks Assistant, Snowflake Cortex, and a flood of AI-native startups.

The AI talent market in 2026 is extraordinarily competitive. Every major tech company and well-funded startup is hiring ML/AI engineers, and compensation has surged accordingly. Hex must pay a meaningful AI premium to attract engineers away from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Databricks. Your ability to build production AI features — not just research prototypes — is the differentiator that Hex values most, and it's the lever you should press hardest in negotiations.

**Level Mapping:** Hex ML/AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta ML Engineer IC4-5 = Databricks ML Engineer = OpenAI Software Engineer

### AI-Native Analytics Engine Lever
Hex's 2026 AI strategy centers on building the most intelligent analytics notebook in the market — an AI engine that understands data schemas, query patterns, user intent, and domain context to provide genuinely useful AI assistance. ML/AI Engineers will build LLM-powered code generation with warehouse-aware context, fine-tuned models for data analysis tasks, retrieval-augmented generation systems for enterprise data catalogs, and evaluation frameworks to ensure AI quality at scale.

This is not incremental feature work — it's building the core AI engine that determines Hex's competitive position. If Hex's AI features are better than Databricks Assistant and Snowflake Cortex, the company wins enterprise deals worth millions. ML/AI Engineers who can ship production AI systems that are fast, reliable, and genuinely useful — not just demo-worthy — are worth an outsized premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Talent Market Premium:** "The ML/AI engineer market is the most competitive in tech. OpenAI is offering $240K base and Anthropic is at $230K for comparable AI product work. I need $245K base and $280K equity/4yr to choose a growth-stage company over established AI labs."
2. **Production AI Shipping Track Record:** "I've shipped AI features used by millions of users at [company] — not research prototypes, but production systems with real reliability and quality requirements. That production AI experience commands $240K base."
3. **Magic Feature Ownership:** "I'll be owning and evolving Magic — the AI feature that defines Hex's product differentiation. That direct revenue impact justifies $250K base and $300K equity/4yr."
4. **AI Recruiter War Premium:** "I received 12 recruiter messages this week from AI companies. The market for ML/AI engineers is at peak competition. Hex needs to pay at the top of the band — $245K base, $290K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus — to secure this hire."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Hex's Magic AI features are the most compelling AI-for-analytics product I've seen — and I want to build the next generation. I'm holding an OpenAI offer at $240K / $350K equity, an Anthropic offer at $230K / $300K equity, and a Databricks offer at $235K / $320K RSU. All are strong. To choose Hex, I need $245K base, $290K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. The AI premium in this market is real, and Hex's growth-stage equity needs to compensate for the liquidity risk. At $245K base, I sign. My floor is $225K — below that, the AI lab offers are too strong financially."
