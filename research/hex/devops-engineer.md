### DevOps Engineer | Hex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity | Data Analytics Platform Pioneer | 2026 Focus: Enterprise-Grade Platform Reliability

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$210K | $110K–$210K | 5–10% | $200K–$280K |
| New York | $155K–$205K | $110K–$210K | 5–10% | $195K–$273K |
| London | £120K–£158K | £82K–£158K | 5–10% | £150K–£210K |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Hex own the platform reliability and deployment infrastructure that enterprise data teams depend on for mission-critical analytics workflows. When a Fortune 500 company runs production dashboards through Hex, downtime isn't just an inconvenience — it's a data outage that affects business decisions across the organization. This enterprise-grade reliability mandate means Hex's DevOps engineers are directly responsible for the platform trust that drives multi-year enterprise contracts.

Hex operates a complex cloud infrastructure stack: multi-tenant notebook execution environments, data warehouse connection management, real-time collaboration servers, and AI inference pipelines. DevOps Engineers who can manage this complexity at scale while maintaining sub-second query performance are in high demand. Companies like Databricks, Snowflake, and Vercel compete for this exact profile, giving you strong negotiation leverage.

### Enterprise-Grade Platform Reliability Lever
Hex's 2026 enterprise push requires five-nines reliability for notebook execution, data warehouse connections, and AI features. Enterprise customers expect SLAs that match Snowflake and Databricks — and Hex's DevOps team must deliver that reliability while the platform ships AI features at startup speed. DevOps Engineers who can build CI/CD pipelines, observability systems, and auto-scaling infrastructure that maintain reliability during rapid feature deployment are critical.

The AI inference layer adds a new dimension of complexity: GPU resource management, model serving latency optimization, and graceful degradation when AI services are under load. If you have experience managing AI/ML infrastructure alongside traditional web application DevOps, you bring a rare combination that Hex urgently needs for its 2026 AI expansion.

**Global Levers**
1. **Enterprise Reliability Premium:** "Hex's enterprise customers require Snowflake-grade reliability. I've built infrastructure that maintained 99.99% uptime at [previous company] serving enterprise data workloads. That experience commands $205K base and $200K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Infrastructure DevOps Hybrid:** "Managing both web application infrastructure and AI inference pipelines is a rare skill set. I bring experience with GPU orchestration, model serving, and traditional DevOps. I'm looking for $210K base to reflect this hybrid premium."
3. **Competing Infrastructure Offers:** "Snowflake is offering $200K base / $230K RSU for a similar reliability engineering role. I need $205K base and $210K equity/4yr to choose Hex over liquid equity."
4. **Platform Trust = Revenue:** "Every SLA violation risks an enterprise churn event. My work directly protects Hex's largest revenue streams. I'd like a $25K signing bonus and $200K equity/4yr to reflect that business impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm drawn to Hex's challenge of delivering enterprise-grade reliability while shipping AI features at startup velocity — that's the exact infrastructure problem I've solved at scale. I'm holding a Snowflake offer at $200K / $230K RSU and a Vercel offer at $195K / $180K RSU. To choose Hex, I need $205K base, $205K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $205K base, I'm committed. My floor is $190K — below that, the liquid public-company equity is the better financial decision."
