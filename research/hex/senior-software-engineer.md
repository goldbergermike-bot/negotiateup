**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Hex own significant product surface areas — from the notebook rendering engine and collaborative editing infrastructure to the query execution layer and AI code generation features. At this level, Hex expects engineers who can independently drive technical decisions, mentor junior engineers, and ship complex features end-to-end without heavy management oversight. The role demands deep expertise in at least one domain (frontend, backend, or data infrastructure) with strong fluency across the full stack.

Hex's position as a leading AI-native analytics platform means Senior SWEs are building at the frontier of how data teams interact with AI. The competitive landscape includes Databricks, Snowflake, and a growing wave of AI-native analytics startups, all competing for the same senior talent. Your experience shipping production data tools or AI-powered interfaces is direct negotiation leverage — Hex cannot afford to lose senior engineers to better-funded competitors.

### AI-Native Notebook Platform Lever
Hex's 2026 roadmap doubles down on AI-native analytics: Magic (AI code generation), automated data storytelling, and intelligent notebook assistance. Senior Software Engineers who can architect reliable AI features at scale — handling prompt engineering, model orchestration, caching, and graceful fallbacks — are mission-critical hires. If you have shipped AI-powered features in production, you command a premium.

The business context strengthens your position further: Hex is competing for enterprise contracts against Databricks and Snowflake, both of which have massive AI feature investments. Senior engineers who accelerate Hex's AI roadmap directly impact revenue growth and fundraising trajectory. Frame your experience as directly tied to Hex's competitive position in the AI analytics market.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Feature Shipping Premium:** "I've shipped AI-powered features to millions of users at [previous company]. Hex's Magic AI features need this exact experience. I'm looking for $245K base and $300K equity/4yr to reflect the AI engineering premium."
2. **Senior Talent Scarcity in Data Tooling:** "Senior engineers with both data platform depth and AI integration experience are exceptionally rare. Databricks is paying $255K base for this profile. I need $245K base to make the growth-stage equity trade-off rational."
3. **Equity Acceleration for Key Hires:** "As a senior hire joining during Hex's AI platform expansion, I'd like front-loaded vesting — 30% year one — and a commitment to refresh grants. The $320K/4yr equity becomes much more compelling with accelerated vesting."
4. **Enterprise Impact Framing:** "Hex's enterprise deals depend on shipping reliable, AI-native features faster than Databricks. I'll directly accelerate that roadmap. I'm asking for $240K base, $310K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm genuinely excited about Hex's position as the AI-native analytics platform — Magic and the notebook AI features are exactly what data teams need. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $255K base / $350K RSU and a Snowflake offer at $240K base / $300K RSU, both liquid. To choose Hex, I need $245K base, $310K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $40K signing bonus. At $245K base, I'm ready to commit. My floor is $225K — below that, the liquid equity at public companies is too significant to walk away from."
