**Negotiation DNA**
Staff Software Engineers at Hex set the technical direction for entire platform domains — defining the architecture of the notebook engine, the AI integration layer, the query execution pipeline, or the collaborative infrastructure. This is the highest IC level at most growth-stage companies, and Hex expects Staff engineers to operate as technical leaders who shape multi-quarter roadmaps, make build-vs-buy decisions, and raise the engineering bar across the organization. You are effectively a technical co-founder for your domain.

At this level, you are extremely scarce in the market. Engineers who combine deep data platform expertise, AI systems knowledge, and the architectural judgment to lead a growing engineering organization are in extraordinary demand. Databricks, Snowflake, Figma, and Notion are all competing for this profile — and they all have significantly more funding. Hex must compensate aggressively to attract Staff-level talent, and you should negotiate accordingly.

### AI-Native Notebook Architecture Lever
Hex's 2026 architectural evolution centers on building a deeply AI-native notebook platform — not just bolting AI features onto existing infrastructure, but rethinking the notebook paradigm around AI-assisted data workflows. Staff Engineers will architect the foundational systems: streaming AI inference pipelines, intelligent caching layers, context-aware code generation, and the infrastructure that makes AI features fast, reliable, and trustworthy at enterprise scale.

This architectural work is existential for Hex's competitive position. If the AI notebook experience is laggy, unreliable, or shallow, enterprise customers will default to Databricks. Staff Engineers who can architect AI-native systems that feel magical are worth a significant premium — and Hex knows it. Use the strategic importance of this architecture work as your primary negotiation lever.

**Global Levers**
1. **Architectural Leadership Premium:** "I'll be architecting the AI-native notebook infrastructure that determines whether Hex wins or loses against Databricks. That's a Staff+ leadership role with direct business impact. I'm looking for $285K base and $460K equity/4yr."
2. **Competing Staff Offers:** "Google is offering L6 at $275K base / $500K RSU and Databricks Staff at $270K base / $450K RSU — both liquid. Hex's vision is more compelling, but I need $285K base, $470K equity/4yr, and a $60K signing bonus to offset the liquidity risk."
3. **Technical Leadership Multiplier:** "At this level, I'm not just shipping code — I'm setting the architectural direction that 15-20 engineers will build on for years. The leverage on my work is enormous. The equity grant should reflect that multiplier: $480K/4yr with front-loaded vesting."
4. **Retention-Grade Equity:** "For a Staff hire in this market, I'd like a guaranteed equity refresh commitment — $120K/year refresh starting year two, ensuring my total comp stays competitive through Hex's growth phase and potential IPO."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Hex's AI-native analytics platform is the most exciting architecture challenge in data tooling right now — and I want to lead it. I'm holding a Google L6 offer at $275K / $500K RSU and a Databricks Staff offer at $270K / $450K RSU, both fully liquid. To choose Hex, I need $285K base, $470K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, a $60K signing bonus, and a guaranteed $120K/year refresh starting year two. At $285K, I commit and bring my entire network of data platform engineers with me. My floor is $260K base — below that, the liquid equity at public companies makes this an irrational financial decision, no matter how compelling Hex's vision is."
