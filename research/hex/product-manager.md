**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Hex drive the strategy and execution for the AI-native analytics platform — defining what features to build, how they should work, and how they fit into the broader product vision. PMs here must be deeply technical: you're working with data engineers, ML engineers, and designers to ship features that professional data teams will adopt and love. Hex's PM role requires understanding SQL, data workflows, and AI capabilities — not just user empathy and business metrics.

Hex competes for PMs against Databricks, Snowflake, Figma, and Notion — all of which offer strong compensation. PMs with data tool domain expertise are particularly scarce and valuable. If you've worked as a data analyst, data scientist, or data engineer before transitioning to product management, that practitioner background is strong leverage — you understand the user because you were the user.

**Level Mapping:** Hex PM = Google L5 PM = Meta PM IC5 = Databricks PM = Snowflake PM = Notion PM

### AI Analytics Product Strategy Lever
Hex's 2026 product strategy centers on becoming the default AI analytics platform — and PMs are the strategic architects of that vision. You'll define the product strategy for AI-powered features: what Magic should generate, how natural language querying should work, when AI should proactively surface insights, and how AI features should integrate with the collaborative notebook experience. These decisions will determine Hex's competitive position for years.

PMs with experience shipping AI products — especially in data, developer tools, or analytics — are in extraordinary demand. Every company is trying to figure out how to integrate AI into their product, but PMs who have actually shipped AI features and measured their impact are rare. If you've owned an AI product area at a previous company, that experience translates directly to Hex's most important strategic initiative.

**Global Levers**
1. **Data Domain PM Expertise:** "I've been a data practitioner and a data product PM — I understand the workflow deeply. That domain expertise is rare among PMs. I'm looking for $220K base and $250K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Product Strategy Premium:** "I've shipped AI-powered product features at [company] with measurable impact on engagement and revenue. PMs who can drive AI product strategy — not just follow engineering's lead — command $225K base."
3. **Competing PM Offers:** "Databricks is offering $225K base / $300K RSU and Snowflake is at $220K / $280K RSU. Both are in the data space with liquid equity. I need $225K base and $255K equity/4yr to choose Hex."
4. **Enterprise Revenue Impact:** "My product decisions will directly impact enterprise deal sizes and adoption rates. I'd like $220K base, $250K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus tied to the revenue leverage of this role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Hex is building the future of AI-native analytics, and I've spent my career at the intersection of data tools and AI products — this is the perfect fit. I'm holding a Databricks PM offer at $225K / $300K RSU and a Snowflake offer at $220K / $280K RSU. To choose Hex, I need $225K base, $255K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $225K base, I commit and start defining Hex's AI product strategy. My floor is $210K — below that, the public-company equity at Databricks is the stronger financial choice."
