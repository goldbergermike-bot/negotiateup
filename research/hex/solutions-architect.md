**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Hex bridge the gap between the product and enterprise customers — designing data architectures, building proof-of-concept notebooks, configuring warehouse integrations, and demonstrating how Hex's AI features solve real business problems. This role requires a rare combination of deep data engineering knowledge, customer-facing communication skills, and product expertise. You must be equally comfortable writing SQL in a Hex notebook and presenting to a CTO.

The Solutions Architect role is directly tied to enterprise revenue — every large deal you support and close adds to Hex's ARR. This revenue impact, combined with the scarcity of data professionals who can sell, gives you meaningful compensation leverage. Competing roles at Snowflake, Databricks, and Fivetran offer strong base salaries plus aggressive variable compensation, establishing your negotiation floor.

### Enterprise AI Analytics Adoption Lever
Hex's 2026 enterprise strategy depends on Solutions Architects who can demonstrate the AI-native analytics value proposition to data leaders — showing enterprise CDOs and VP Analytics how Magic, AI-powered insights, and collaborative notebooks replace their current fragmented analytics workflows. SAs who can articulate the AI analytics vision and build compelling demo environments are directly responsible for enterprise deal velocity.

The AI dimension adds a new requirement: you must understand LLM capabilities, prompt engineering patterns, and AI feature limitations well enough to set accurate expectations with enterprise buyers. SAs who can confidently demonstrate AI features, address AI security concerns, and architect AI-integrated data workflows will close larger deals faster. This AI literacy premium is new and growing.

**Global Levers**
1. **Revenue Attribution Premium:** "I directly influence enterprise deal closures worth $500K–$2M+ ARR each. My technical demos and architecture designs are what convert prospects to customers. That revenue impact justifies $205K base plus 25% variable."
2. **Data Platform SA Scarcity:** "Solutions Architects who combine deep data engineering skills with AI product knowledge and enterprise sales ability are exceptionally rare. Snowflake is offering $210K base / 20% variable / $200K RSU. I need $205K base and 25% variable."
3. **AI Demo Expertise:** "I can build compelling AI analytics demos that sell — I understand LLM capabilities, limitations, and how to position them with enterprise buyers. That AI literacy premium means $210K base and $195K equity/4yr."
4. **Accelerated Deal Velocity:** "With my enterprise data platform relationships and domain expertise, I can accelerate Hex's enterprise pipeline by bringing warm introductions to [number] target accounts. That pipeline value justifies a $30K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've sold complex data platform solutions to Fortune 500 companies and I understand how to position AI analytics for enterprise buyers — that's exactly what Hex needs for its enterprise expansion. I'm holding a Snowflake SA offer at $210K / 20% variable / $200K RSU and a Databricks offer at $200K / 25% variable / $180K RSU. To choose Hex, I need $205K base, 25% variable, $195K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $205K base, I commit and bring my enterprise data network with me. My floor is $190K base — below that, the liquid equity and established enterprise motion at Snowflake is the safer career bet."
