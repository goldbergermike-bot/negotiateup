**Negotiation DNA**

Design at Oracle spans two worlds: the modernizing enterprise applications (Fusion, NetSuite) and the cloud-native OCI console. The design transformation from legacy Oracle UX to modern, developer-friendly cloud interfaces is one of the biggest UX challenges in enterprise software. Oracle has invested heavily in design under the Redwood design system — a unified design language across all Oracle products. The Stargate JV creates new design surfaces: AI infrastructure dashboards, GPU cluster management UIs, and developer experiences for AI workloads. Base-heavy comp; sign-on is the lever.
