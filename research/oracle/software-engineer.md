### Software Engineer | Oracle Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Sign-On Bonus Culture | OCI "Stargate" AI Infrastructure Pivot | $500B JV Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Sign-On / Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Austin | $135K–$168K | $80K–$150K | $15K–$30K sign-on | $155K–$210K |
| Seattle | $145K–$178K | $90K–$160K | $15K–$35K sign-on | $168K–$222K |
| Bangalore | ₹18L–₹32L | ₹8L–₹18L | ₹2L–₹5L sign-on | ₹22L–₹38L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Oracle in 2026 is not your parents' Oracle. The $500B Stargate JV with OpenAI and SoftBank positions Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) as the AI infrastructure backbone for the world's most important AI company. OCI is growing 50%+ YoY, Oracle's market cap has surpassed $400B, and Larry Ellison's vision of Oracle as the AI cloud is being validated by the largest technology investment in history. Oracle's comp model is base-heavy with below-market RSUs but generous sign-on bonuses — the sign-on is the lever most candidates miss. Oracle also offers a predictable annual bonus (typically 8-15%). For infrastructure and cloud roles, the Stargate JV creates a negotiation premium that didn't exist before 2025. [Source: Oracle SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle IC3 SWE = Google L3 = Meta E3 = AWS SDE-I

**Global Levers**

1. **Stargate JV — $500B AI Infrastructure:** "Oracle is the cloud infrastructure partner for the $500B Stargate JV with OpenAI and SoftBank — the largest technology investment in history. I'm building the cloud that powers the world's most important AI company."
2. **OCI Growth 50%+ YoY:** "OCI is Oracle's fastest-growing business, with 50%+ YoY growth. Every engineering improvement I make to OCI directly accelerates the cloud revenue that's transforming Oracle."
3. **Sign-On Bonus Is the Hidden Lever:** "Oracle's RSUs are below market, but sign-on bonuses are generous. Push for a $30K-$50K sign-on: 'I need a $45K sign-on to bridge the RSU gap between Oracle and competing offers.'"
4. **Oracle Is Not Legacy:** "Oracle 2026 is an AI cloud company backed by the $500B Stargate JV. Frame your negotiation around the new Oracle, not the old one."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about OCI's role in the Stargate JV — Oracle is the AI cloud infrastructure partner for the largest tech investment in history. The base is competitive, but I need the sign-on and RSUs to bridge the gap vs. my AWS/Google Cloud offer. I'm targeting a $40K sign-on bonus and $145K RSUs over 4 years. The Stargate opportunity justifies above-standard comp for OCI engineers." Oracle will flex on sign-on more than RSUs — push sign-on to $35K+ and RSUs to $130K+.
