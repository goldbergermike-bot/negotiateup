### Senior Software Engineer | Oracle Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Sign-On Bonus Culture | OCI "Stargate" AI Infrastructure Pivot | $500B JV Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Sign-On / Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Austin | $165K–$205K | $130K–$230K | $25K–$60K sign-on | $200K–$270K |
| Seattle | $178K–$218K | $145K–$250K | $30K–$70K sign-on | $218K–$290K |
| Bangalore | ₹30L–₹48L | ₹15L–₹28L | ₹4L–₹8L sign-on | ₹38L–₹58L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at Oracle own critical OCI services — compute, networking, storage, database, Kubernetes (OKE), or the increasingly strategic AI infrastructure (GPU clusters, AI model serving). The Stargate JV means senior OCI engineers are building infrastructure that OpenAI will use at massive scale — your engineering decisions directly impact the world's most important AI company. Oracle's comp at senior level is base-heavy with improving but still below-FAANG RSUs. The sign-on bonus is where Oracle has the most flexibility: $25K-$70K sign-ons are common and can be pushed higher for OCI talent. Annual bonuses run 10-15%. Oracle refreshes have improved significantly under the OCI transformation. [Source: Oracle Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle IC4 Senior SWE = Google L4 = Meta E4 = AWS SDE-II

**Global Levers**

1. **Stargate Infrastructure Builder:** "I'll build OCI infrastructure that serves the $500B Stargate JV. My engineering directly powers OpenAI's AI workloads — the most important AI infrastructure deployment in history."
2. **OCI Senior Engineer Scarcity:** "Senior engineers with cloud infrastructure expertise are Oracle's biggest hiring bottleneck for OCI. AWS, GCP, and Azure are all recruiting from the same pool. Oracle needs to pay market to compete."
3. **Outsize Sign-On Strategy:** Push for $60K-$80K sign-on: "Oracle's RSUs are improving but still trail FAANG. I need a $70K sign-on to bridge the Year 1 gap between Oracle and my AWS/Google offer."
4. **OCI Refresh Trajectory:** "Oracle's RSU refreshes for OCI have improved dramatically. I want a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of $[X] to ensure my comp trajectory stays competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a senior role building OCI infrastructure that serves the Stargate JV — the cloud powering OpenAI — I need $218K base, $235K RSUs over 4 years, and a $65K sign-on bonus. My AWS offer is $290K total with no sign-on needed. The Stargate opportunity is unique, but the comp package needs to bridge the gap." Oracle will flex most on sign-on — accept at $195K+ base, $200K+ RSUs, and $50K+ sign-on.
