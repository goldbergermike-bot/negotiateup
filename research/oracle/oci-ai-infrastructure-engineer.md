### OCI AI Infrastructure Engineer | Oracle Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + **OUTSIZE SIGN-ON** | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15–25% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM** | $500B Stargate JV Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Sign-On / Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Austin | $178K–$222K | $170K–$290K | $50K–$100K sign-on | $235K–$318K |
| Seattle | $188K–$235K | $185K–$310K | $55K–$115K sign-on | $250K–$338K |
| Bangalore | ₹38L–₹60L | ₹20L–₹35L | ₹6L–₹12L sign-on | ₹50L–₹75L |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Oracle's signature role for 2026 — the OCI AI Infrastructure Engineer. You build the cloud infrastructure that powers the $500B Stargate JV: GPU superclusters (NVIDIA H100/B200), ultra-low-latency RDMA networking for distributed AI training, bare-metal compute optimized for AI workloads, AI model serving infrastructure, and the orchestration layer that makes OCI the cloud of choice for the world's most important AI company. This role exists because of Stargate — it's the engineering that delivers on Oracle's most consequential partnership. OpenAI chose OCI over AWS, GCP, and Azure for Stargate's AI training infrastructure, and the engineers in this role are the reason why. [Source: Oracle OCI AI Infrastructure Team 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle OCI AI Infra Eng (Senior) = AWS Annapurna/Trainium Team = Google TPU Infrastructure Eng = NVIDIA DGX Cloud Eng

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The OCI AI Infrastructure Engineer works at the intersection of cloud infrastructure and AI training at unprecedented scale:
- **GPU Superclusters:** Building and managing clusters of tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs — the largest AI training deployments in the world
- **RDMA Networking:** Ultra-low-latency networking for distributed AI training — RoCEv2, InfiniBand, and custom networking fabrics that enable multi-node GPU communication at wire speed
- **Bare-Metal AI Compute:** OCI's bare-metal offering (no hypervisor overhead) is a key differentiator for AI training — you build the compute infrastructure that delivers 100% GPU utilization
- **AI Workload Orchestration:** Scheduling, scaling, and managing AI training jobs across GPU superclusters — checkpoint management, fault tolerance, and resource optimization at massive scale
- **Stargate Data Center Infrastructure:** The physical and logical infrastructure for Stargate's dedicated AI data centers — power, cooling, networking, and compute at $500B investment scale

**Stargate Outsize Sign-On — Maximum Push**

This is the role where the "Outsize Sign-On" lever is strongest:
- **Frame:** "I build the infrastructure that delivers on Oracle's $500B Stargate commitment. This is the most strategically important engineering role at Oracle. The sign-on must reflect that existential importance."
- **Benchmark:** "Google TPU infra engineers earn $350K+. AWS Annapurna engineers earn $340K+. Oracle's RSUs are lower — a $100K+ sign-on is required to make the total comp work."
- **Two-Year Sign-On:** Request sign-on split: "$100K sign-on — $65K Year 1, $35K Year 2 — to bridge comp until RSU refreshes scale with OCI growth."

**Global Levers**

1. **$500B Stargate Delivery:** "I build the infrastructure that delivers on Oracle's $500B Stargate commitment to OpenAI. My engineering determines whether Oracle meets the infrastructure milestones that justify the world's largest technology investment."
2. **GPU Supercluster Engineering:** "I manage GPU superclusters of tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs — the largest AI training deployments in the world. This is infrastructure engineering at a scale that only 3-4 companies worldwide achieve."
3. **Why OpenAI Chose OCI:** "OpenAI chose OCI over AWS, GCP, and Azure for Stargate. The engineers in this role are the reason why — bare-metal performance, RDMA networking, and GPU utilization that competitors can't match."
4. **Outsize Sign-On — Maximum:** Push for $100K-$120K sign-on: "OCI AI Infrastructure Engineers delivering Stargate should receive the highest sign-ons in Oracle's history. $110K sign-on reflects the strategic importance."
5. **Agentic AI Premium (15-25%):** If building autonomous infrastructure management (self-healing GPU clusters, automated workload migration, predictive failure detection), push for the full premium.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build the OCI AI infrastructure that delivers on the $500B Stargate JV — GPU superclusters, RDMA networking, and the bare-metal AI compute that made OpenAI choose Oracle over every other cloud. I need $225K base, $295K RSUs over 4 years, and a $108K sign-on bonus. The sign-on is the Stargate premium — this is the most strategically important engineering at Oracle, and the sign-on must reflect that. My Google TPU infra offer is $380K total and my AWS Annapurna offer is $365K. Oracle's Stargate opportunity is once-in-a-career, but the comp must bridge the structural RSU gap through an outsize sign-on." Oracle has maximum flexibility for Stargate-critical roles. Accept at $210K+ base, $260K+ RSUs, and $90K+ sign-on. This is the role where Oracle will stretch furthest — the $500B JV depends on retaining this engineering talent.
