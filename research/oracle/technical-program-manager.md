**Negotiation DNA**

Oracle TPMs coordinate programs across the most complex product portfolio in enterprise software — OCI cloud services, Oracle Database, Fusion ERP/HCM/SCM, NetSuite, Health Sciences, and now the Stargate AI infrastructure programs. The Stargate JV creates the highest-stakes TPM program: coordinating OCI infrastructure delivery for OpenAI's AI workloads on a timeline dictated by the $500B investment commitment. Oracle TPMs who manage Stargate-related programs are doing the most consequential program management in cloud computing. Base-heavy comp; sign-on is the lever. Annual bonus runs 10-15%.

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Senior TPM = Google L4 TPM = AWS Senior TPM = Meta IC4 TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Stargate Program Coordination:** "The Stargate JV requires coordinating OCI infrastructure delivery across Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank — a tri-party program with $500B at stake. This is the highest-stakes program management in cloud computing."
2. **Cross-Product Portfolio Complexity:** "Oracle's product portfolio is the broadest in enterprise software. I coordinate releases across OCI, Database, Fusion, NetSuite, and Health Sciences — unmatched program complexity."
3. **OCI Delivery Timelines:** "OCI infrastructure delivery timelines are driven by Stargate commitments to OpenAI. Missing a Stargate milestone has $500B JV implications."
4. **Sign-On Lever:** Push for $40K-$55K sign-on: "TPM RSUs trail FAANG. A $45K sign-on bridges Year 1."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a TPM role coordinating Stargate infrastructure delivery — tri-party programs with $500B at stake — I need $192K base, $188K RSUs over 4 years, and a $44K sign-on. I have competing TPM offers at market rate." Accept at $180K+ base, $165K+ RSUs, and $35K+ sign-on.
