### Solutions Architect | Oracle Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Sign-On Bonus Culture | OCI "Stargate" AI Infrastructure Pivot | $500B JV Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Sign-On / Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Austin | $162K–$200K | $115K–$200K | $25K–$50K sign-on | $198K–$265K |
| Seattle | $172K–$212K | $125K–$215K | $28K–$55K sign-on | $212K–$280K |
| Bangalore | ₹32L–₹50L | ₹12L–₹22L | ₹3L–₹7L sign-on | ₹38L–₹58L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Oracle SAs guide enterprise customers through the massive Oracle product portfolio: OCI cloud migration, Autonomous Database adoption, Fusion ERP/HCM implementation, and now AI infrastructure deployment through the Stargate-validated OCI platform. The Stargate JV gives SAs the most powerful proof point in cloud sales: "Oracle's cloud infrastructure is trusted by OpenAI for the world's most important AI workloads." SAs who can articulate the OCI + Stargate narrative drive the highest-value cloud deals. Oracle's SA comp is base-heavy with sign-on bonuses and annual bonuses (10-15%).

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Senior SA = Google Customer Engineer = AWS Senior SA = Snowflake Senior SA

**Global Levers**

1. **Stargate Proof Point:** "OpenAI chose OCI for the $500B Stargate JV. I use this proof point in every customer conversation — if OCI is trusted for the world's most important AI workloads, it's trusted for yours."
2. **Cross-Portfolio Revenue:** "I sell across OCI, Database, Fusion, and NetSuite. Cross-portfolio SAs drive 2-3x the deal size of single-product SAs."
3. **Cloud Migration Revenue:** "Every legacy Oracle customer I migrate to OCI converts maintenance revenue to cloud subscription revenue — the highest-value revenue conversion at Oracle."
4. **Sign-On Lever:** Push for $48K-$60K sign-on: "SA RSUs are below market. A $52K sign-on bridges the Year 1 gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an SA role leveraging the Stargate proof point to drive OCI cloud migration and cross-portfolio revenue, I need $198K base, $198K RSUs over 4 years, and a $50K sign-on. I have competing SA offers from [Snowflake/Databricks] with stronger equity." Accept at $185K+ base, $175K+ RSUs, and $40K+ sign-on.
