### Product Manager | Oracle Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Sign-On Bonus Culture | OCI "Stargate" AI Infrastructure Pivot | $500B JV Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Sign-On / Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Austin | $155K–$192K | $110K–$195K | $20K–$45K sign-on | $188K–$252K |
| Seattle | $165K–$205K | $120K–$210K | $25K–$50K sign-on | $200K–$268K |
| Bangalore | ₹32L–₹50L | ₹12L–₹22L | ₹3L–₹6L sign-on | ₹38L–₹58L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Oracle PMs own products across a massive portfolio: OCI cloud services, Oracle Database (Autonomous Database), enterprise applications (Fusion ERP, HCM, SCM), NetSuite, and health sciences. The Stargate JV creates the highest-leverage PM opportunity: defining OCI AI infrastructure products that OpenAI and the broader AI ecosystem will use. Oracle PMs need to navigate the tension between legacy enterprise customers (who want stability) and cloud-native customers (who want cutting-edge). The comp model is base-heavy; sign-on bonuses are the primary negotiation lever. Annual bonus runs 10-15%. [Source: Oracle PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle IC4 PM = Google L4 PM = AWS Senior PM = Meta IC4 PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Stargate Product Strategy:** "I'll define OCI product strategy for Stargate AI workloads — GPU compute products, AI model serving, and the infrastructure products that OpenAI depends on. This is the most consequential cloud PM work."
2. **Database-Cloud Product Integration:** "Oracle's unique advantage is the database-cloud combo. I'll productize the Autonomous Database + OCI integration that no competitor can replicate."
3. **Sign-On Lever:** Push for $45K-$55K sign-on: "Oracle PM RSUs trail FAANG. I need a $50K sign-on to make the Year 1 comp work."
4. **Oracle Transformation Narrative:** "Oracle 2026 is not legacy Oracle. I'm PMing cloud products backed by the $500B Stargate JV. That transformation story justifies above-standard PM comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a PM role defining OCI AI infrastructure products for the Stargate JV, I need $200K base, $200K RSUs over 4 years, and a $48K sign-on. My AWS PM offer is $280K total. Oracle's Stargate opportunity is unique, but the comp needs to reflect that." Accept at $185K+ base, $175K+ RSUs, and $38K+ sign-on.
