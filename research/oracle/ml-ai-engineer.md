### ML/AI Engineer | Oracle Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + **OUTSIZE SIGN-ON** | OCI "Stargate" AI Infrastructure Pivot | **+15–25% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM** | $500B JV Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Sign-On / Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Austin | $175K–$218K | $165K–$280K | $40K–$80K sign-on | $228K–$308K |
| Seattle | $185K–$228K | $178K–$300K | $45K–$95K sign-on | $242K–$325K |
| Bangalore | ₹38L–₹58L | ₹18L–₹32L | ₹5L–₹10L sign-on | ₹48L–₹72L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Oracle ML/AI Engineers build the AI layer across Oracle's product portfolio: Autonomous Database ML features, OCI AI services, Oracle AI for Fusion applications, and the Stargate-driven AI infrastructure ML (GPU cluster optimization, AI workload scheduling, model serving infrastructure). The Stargate JV makes this the most strategically important ML role at Oracle: you're building AI infrastructure that serves OpenAI alongside Oracle's own AI products. The Agentic AI Premium (15-25%) applies for engineers building autonomous database management, self-optimizing cloud infrastructure, or AI agent deployment platforms. Outsize sign-on territory for ML roles given Stargate strategic importance. [Source: Oracle ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Senior ML Eng = Google L4 ML = AWS Senior ML Eng = Meta E4 ML

**Global Levers**

1. **Stargate AI Infrastructure ML:** "I build the ML systems that optimize OCI AI infrastructure for the Stargate JV — GPU cluster scheduling, AI workload management, and the infrastructure ML that makes OpenAI's training efficient."
2. **Autonomous Database ML:** "Autonomous Database's self-tuning, self-patching, and self-scaling are ML systems I build. My models power Oracle's most differentiated product — the self-driving database."
3. **Agentic AI Premium (15-25%):** "I build autonomous systems — self-driving databases, self-optimizing cloud infrastructure, AI agents for enterprise applications. This is agentic AI applied to the most critical enterprise systems."
4. **Outsize Sign-On — ML Stargate Premium:** Push for $80K-$100K sign-on: "ML engineers building Stargate AI infrastructure command outsize sign-ons. $88K sign-on reflects the strategic importance."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an ML/AI role building Stargate AI infrastructure and Autonomous Database ML — the most strategically important AI work at Oracle — I need $218K base, $278K RSUs over 4 years, and an $88K sign-on with the Agentic AI Premium. I have a Google ML offer at $370K and a Databricks pre-IPO ML offer at $420K. Oracle's Stargate opportunity is unique, but the outsize sign-on must bridge the equity gap." Accept at $200K+ base, $245K+ RSUs, and $72K+ sign-on.
