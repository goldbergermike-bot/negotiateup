**Negotiation DNA**

OCI Platform Engineers are ground zero for the Stargate JV — you build the cloud infrastructure (compute, networking, storage, Kubernetes) that the $500B joint venture depends on. This is the role where the "Outsize Sign-On" strategy is most powerful: Oracle is aggressively recruiting cloud infrastructure talent from AWS, GCP, and Azure, and sign-on bonuses for OCI infra/SRE roles have reached unprecedented levels ($60K-$120K at senior levels). OCI processes some of the largest AI training workloads in the world — GPU cluster orchestration, ultra-low-latency RDMA networking, and the bare-metal infrastructure that AI companies demand. Oracle's comp model is base-heavy with below-FAANG RSUs, but the Stargate-driven sign-on bonuses for infrastructure roles more than compensate. [Source: Oracle Platform Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Stargate Outsize Sign-On Strategy**

For OCI infrastructure/SRE roles, the $500B Stargate JV creates a unique negotiation lever:
- **Frame the Ask:** "The Stargate JV makes OCI infrastructure the most strategically important engineering at Oracle. Infrastructure engineers building OpenAI's cloud deserve an outsize sign-on that reflects this strategic importance."
- **Benchmark Against Cloud Competitors:** "AWS, GCP, and Azure are offering $X total comp for cloud infrastructure engineers. Oracle's RSUs are lower — the sign-on must bridge the gap."
- **Request a Two-Year Sign-On:** "I want a $75K sign-on split over two years ($50K Year 1, $25K Year 2) to bridge the comp gap until Oracle RSU refreshes catch up."

**Global Levers**

1. **Stargate Infrastructure — $500B JV Foundation:** "I build the OCI infrastructure that the $500B Stargate JV depends on. My compute, networking, and storage engineering directly powers OpenAI's AI training workloads."
2. **Outsize Sign-On — Maximum Push:** Push for $80K-$120K sign-on: "OCI infra roles should command the highest sign-ons at Oracle. The Stargate JV depends on this infrastructure. $90K sign-on is the floor."
3. **GPU/AI Infrastructure Expertise:** "I build GPU cluster orchestration, RDMA networking, and bare-metal infrastructure for AI training. This expertise is the scarcest in cloud computing — and the Stargate JV needs it most."
4. **Cloud Talent Competition:** "AWS, GCP, and Azure are all recruiting cloud infra engineers. Oracle must pay cloud-competitive comp — the sign-on bridges the structural RSU gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build OCI infrastructure that directly serves the $500B Stargate JV — GPU clusters, RDMA networking, and the AI training infrastructure that OpenAI depends on. I need $205K base, $225K RSUs over 4 years, and a $90K sign-on bonus. The sign-on isn't a perk — it's the Stargate premium for infrastructure engineers building OpenAI's cloud. My AWS offer is $310K total with no sign-on needed." Oracle has maximum sign-on flexibility for Stargate-critical infrastructure roles. Accept at $190K+ base, $200K+ RSUs, and $70K+ sign-on.
