### Data Scientist | Oracle Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Sign-On Bonus Culture | OCI "Stargate" AI Infrastructure Pivot | $500B JV Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Sign-On / Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Austin | $158K–$195K | $115K–$200K | $20K–$45K sign-on | $190K–$255K |
| Seattle | $168K–$208K | $125K–$218K | $25K–$50K sign-on | $205K–$272K |
| Bangalore | ₹30L–₹48L | ₹12L–₹22L | ₹3L–₹6L sign-on | ₹35L–₹55L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Oracle Data Scientists work with uniquely valuable enterprise data: Oracle's database is the backbone of the world's largest financial institutions, healthcare systems, telecoms, and governments. The DS role spans internal analytics (OCI usage optimization, customer health), product ML features (Autonomous Database optimization, Oracle AI), and the Stargate-driven AI infrastructure analytics. Oracle's 40+ years of enterprise data expertise combined with the Stargate JV creates DS opportunities that didn't exist before — building intelligence on the AI infrastructure that powers OpenAI. Base-heavy comp; sign-on is the lever. [Source: Oracle DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle IC4 Senior DS = Google L4 DS = AWS Senior DS = Meta IC4 DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Data Moat:** "Oracle has 40+ years of enterprise data — financial, healthcare, telecom, government. My ML models leverage the deepest enterprise data moat in technology."
2. **Autonomous Database Intelligence:** "Autonomous Database uses ML for self-tuning, self-patching, and self-scaling. My DS work builds the intelligence that makes Oracle's flagship product autonomous."
3. **Stargate AI Analytics:** "The Stargate JV generates massive infrastructure telemetry. I build analytics on the AI infrastructure powering OpenAI — a unique DS opportunity."
4. **Sign-On Lever:** Push for $45K-$55K sign-on: "DS RSUs at Oracle trail FAANG. A $48K sign-on bridges Year 1."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a DS role building Autonomous Database intelligence AND Stargate infrastructure analytics, I need $195K base, $205K RSUs over 4 years, and a $45K sign-on. Oracle's enterprise data moat is the deepest in technology. I have competing DS offers from [Databricks/Snowflake] with stronger equity." Accept at $185K+ base, $180K+ RSUs, and $38K+ sign-on.
