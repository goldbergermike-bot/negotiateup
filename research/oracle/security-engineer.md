### Security Engineer | Oracle Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + **OUTSIZE SIGN-ON** | OCI "Stargate" AI Infrastructure Pivot | $500B JV Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Sign-On / Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Austin | $172K–$212K | $140K–$238K | $35K–$70K sign-on | $218K–$290K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Oracle Security Engineers protect the infrastructure trusted by the world's largest financial institutions, governments, healthcare systems — and now, through the Stargate JV, the world's most important AI company. OCI security is the highest-stakes cloud security: securing AI training infrastructure that OpenAI depends on, maintaining FedRAMP/IL5 certifications for government workloads, and protecting the database backbone of the global financial system. The Stargate JV creates an outsize sign-on opportunity for security/infra roles: Oracle needs security engineers who can certify OCI infrastructure at the classification and compliance levels that Stargate demands.

**Stargate Outsize Sign-On — Security**

- **Frame:** "Stargate requires OCI infrastructure certified to the highest security standards. I bring the cloud security and compliance expertise to certify OCI for OpenAI's most sensitive AI workloads. That's an outsize sign-on scenario."
- **Push:** Request $65K-$90K sign-on for security roles: "OCI security engineers certifying Stargate infrastructure should command the highest sign-ons in the security org."

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Senior Security Eng = Google L4 Security = AWS Senior Security Eng = CrowdStrike Senior Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Stargate Security Certification:** "I certify OCI infrastructure for Stargate — the security standards that OpenAI requires for AI training workloads. Stargate security certification is the highest-priority security work at Oracle."
2. **Financial + Government + AI Security:** "I secure infrastructure trusted by global financial institutions, government agencies, AND the Stargate AI JV. This triple-threat security surface is unique to Oracle."
3. **Outsize Sign-On — Security Premium:** Push for $70K-$90K sign-on: "Cloud security engineers with compliance certification expertise (FedRAMP, IL5, SOC 2) are scarce. The Stargate JV makes this an outsize sign-on role."
4. **Oracle Database Security Moat:** "Oracle Database security (Transparent Data Encryption, Database Vault, Audit Vault) is the deepest in the industry. My work protects the data backbone of the global financial system."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I secure OCI infrastructure for the Stargate JV — certifying AI training infrastructure to the compliance standards OpenAI requires. I also protect Oracle's database backbone trusted by the global financial system. I need $215K base, $240K RSUs over 4 years, and a $78K sign-on. This is outsize sign-on territory — Stargate security certification is the highest-priority security work at Oracle." Accept at $200K+ base, $210K+ RSUs, and $60K+ sign-on.
