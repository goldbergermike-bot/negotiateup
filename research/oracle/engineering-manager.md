**Negotiation DNA**

Oracle EMs lead teams building OCI services, Oracle Database cloud features, or enterprise application infrastructure (Fusion, NetSuite). The OCI transformation has made Oracle EM roles dramatically more interesting — you're building cloud-native services competing with AWS, GCP, and Azure. The Stargate JV means EMs building OCI infrastructure or AI services are leading teams doing the most strategically important work in Oracle's history. Oracle's EM comp is base-heavy with sign-on bonuses as the primary negotiation lever. Annual bonus runs 12-18%. EMs who can recruit cloud-native talent into Oracle (overcoming the legacy perception) are especially valued. [Source: Oracle EM Comp 2025-2026]

3. **Outsize Sign-On:** Push for $75K-$100K sign-on: "OCI EM roles compete with AWS, GCP, and Azure for cloud management talent. I need a $85K sign-on to bridge the Year 1 gap."
4. **OCI Growth Team Impact:** "OCI is growing 50%+ YoY. My team's engineering output directly drives this acceleration. Team velocity = revenue velocity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an EM role building OCI teams that serve the Stargate JV, I need $238K base, $295K RSUs over 4 years, and an $80K sign-on. I'm recruiting cloud talent into Oracle — overcoming the legacy perception — to build OpenAI's infrastructure. My AWS SDM offer is $380K total. The sign-on bridges the Year 1 gap."
