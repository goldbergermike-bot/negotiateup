### Staff Software Engineer | Oracle Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Sign-On Bonus Culture | OCI "Stargate" AI Infrastructure Pivot | $500B JV Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Sign-On / Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Austin | $205K–$252K | $220K–$380K | $50K–$100K sign-on | $280K–$378K |
| Seattle | $218K–$265K | $240K–$400K | $60K–$120K sign-on | $300K–$400K |
| Bangalore | ₹48L–₹72L | ₹30L–₹52L | ₹8L–₹15L sign-on | ₹60L–₹92L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Engineers at Oracle are the architects defining OCI's infrastructure direction — the compute architecture (Arm-based Ampere + x86 + GPU clusters), networking fabric (ultra-low-latency RDMA for AI training), storage systems, and the database-cloud integration that is Oracle's unique advantage. At staff level, the Stargate JV creates unprecedented negotiation leverage: you're architecting the cloud infrastructure for a $500B AI initiative. Oracle's sign-on bonuses at staff level can reach $100K-$120K — this is the primary lever for bridging the gap vs. FAANG. RSUs have improved dramatically but still trail Google/Meta staff offers. The annual bonus at staff is 12-18%. [Source: Oracle Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle IC5 Staff SWE = Google L5 = Meta E5 = AWS Principal SDE

**Global Levers**

1. **Stargate Architecture — $500B Infrastructure Decisions:** "I'm making the architectural decisions for the cloud infrastructure behind the $500B Stargate JV. My technical choices define how OpenAI runs at scale. These are the most consequential cloud architecture decisions in the industry."
2. **Outsize Sign-On at Staff Level:** Push for $100K-$120K sign-on: "Oracle's RSUs trail FAANG at staff level. I need a $110K sign-on to bridge Year 1 comp. This is the Stargate premium — staff architects building OpenAI's infrastructure should command outsize sign-ons."
3. **Database-Cloud Integration Moat:** "Oracle's unique advantage is database-cloud integration — autonomous database on OCI. I architect the integration between Oracle's $50B+ database business and OCI cloud. No other cloud has this moat."
4. **GPU/AI Infrastructure Architecture:** "I architect the GPU cluster infrastructure, RDMA networking, and AI training infrastructure that the Stargate JV depends on. This is the highest-stakes infrastructure work in cloud computing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a staff role architecting OCI infrastructure for the $500B Stargate JV — the cloud behind OpenAI — I need $250K base, $370K RSUs over 4 years, and a $110K sign-on. My Google L5 offer is $480K total with liquid RSUs. The Stargate opportunity is architecturally unique, but the comp gap at staff level requires an outsize sign-on to bridge." Oracle has flexibility for Stargate-critical staff roles. Accept at $235K+ base, $330K+ RSUs, and $90K+ sign-on.
