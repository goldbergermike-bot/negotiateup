**Negotiation DNA**

Oracle Data Engineers work at a company that IS database infrastructure — building the data pipelines, analytics platforms, and data integration tools that power Oracle's business and products. The unique position: you're a data engineer at the world's leading database company, building data infrastructure on Oracle Database (the gold standard for enterprise OLTP), Autonomous Data Warehouse, and OCI data services. The Stargate JV adds a new dimension: data engineering for AI training pipelines, model performance analytics, and the infrastructure telemetry from OpenAI's workloads. Base-heavy comp; sign-on is the lever. [Source: Oracle DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Senior DE = Google L4 DE = AWS Senior DE = Databricks Senior DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Engineering at the Database Company:** "I build data infrastructure at the world's leading database company. My data pipelines run on Oracle Database — the gold standard for enterprise data. This is meta-data-engineering at the highest level."
2. **Autonomous Data Warehouse:** "Oracle's Autonomous Data Warehouse uses ML for self-tuning and self-optimization. I build the data engineering that makes Oracle's flagship analytics product work."
3. **Stargate Data Pipelines:** "The Stargate JV generates massive telemetry and analytics data. I build the data pipelines that analyze AI infrastructure performance for the $500B JV."
4. **Sign-On Lever:** Push for $42K-$55K sign-on: "DE RSUs trail FAANG. A $48K sign-on bridges Year 1."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a data engineering role at the world's leading database company — building data infrastructure on Autonomous Data Warehouse and analytics for the Stargate JV — I need $190K base, $195K RSUs over 4 years, and a $45K sign-on. I have competing DE offers from [Databricks/Snowflake] with stronger equity." Accept at $178K+ base, $172K+ RSUs, and $38K+ sign-on.
