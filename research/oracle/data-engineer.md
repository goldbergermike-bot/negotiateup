Oracle Data Engineers work at a company that IS database infrastructure — building the data pipelines, analytics platforms, and data integration tools that power Oracle's business and products. The unique position: you're a data engineer at the world's leading database company, building data infrastructure on Oracle Database (the gold standard for enterprise OLTP), Autonomous Data Warehouse, and OCI data services. The Stargate JV adds a new dimension: data engineering for AI training pipelines, model performance analytics, and the infrastructure telemetry from OpenAI's workloads. Base-heavy comp; sign-on is the lever. [Source: Oracle DE Comp 2025-2026]
