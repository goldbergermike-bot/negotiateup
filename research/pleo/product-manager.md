**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Pleo own the strategic direction of features that directly impact how 30,000+ businesses manage their spending across Europe. You are not just shipping features — you are defining the product surfaces that drive Pleo's Cash-Management Yield revenue, from card issuance flows to automated expense categorization to multi-entity spend controls. Every product decision you make influences transaction volume, customer retention, and the platform's ability to generate Real-Time Yield on customer float.

Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion strategy is fundamentally a product-led motion. As the company grows beyond its current 30,000+ merchant base and expands into new European markets, Product Managers are the ones determining which features, integrations, and experiences will drive adoption and increase the volume of funds flowing through the platform. This is a pre-IPO company ($4.7B peak valuation, backed by Bain Capital, Thrive Capital, and Stripes) where product decisions have outsized impact on company valuation.

Your negotiation should emphasize the direct revenue linkage of product management at a fintech company. Unlike product roles at traditional SaaS companies, your work at Pleo has an immediate, measurable impact on financial flows, yield generation, and customer lifetime value. The spend management category is rapidly growing in Europe, and Pleo's product leadership is its primary differentiator against competitors like Spendesk, Soldo, and Moss.

### Real-Time Yield — The Liquidity-Expansion Premium

**Lever 1 — Yield Product Ownership:** "As a Product Manager at Pleo, I'll own the product strategy for features that directly drive Cash-Management Yield revenue. My roadmap decisions on float management, payment timing, and card product design determine how effectively Pleo monetizes its platform. I'm requesting base compensation of DKK 900,000 / £108,000 / €102,000 to reflect direct revenue ownership."

**Lever 2 — Pre-IPO Product Equity:** "Product Managers at pre-IPO fintechs like Pleo are uniquely positioned to influence valuation through feature velocity and market expansion. With Bain Capital and Thrive Capital backing, the IPO trajectory is clear. I'd like an option grant of DKK 550,000 / £60,000 / €55,000 over four years, reflecting the direct line between my product decisions and company valuation."

**Lever 3 — Liquidity-Expansion Product Strategy:** "Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion strategy depends on product-led growth across the 30,000+ merchant network and into new European markets. My ability to identify, prioritize, and ship features that increase transaction volume and customer adoption is the primary growth lever. I'm requesting a performance bonus of 12-15% of base tied to Liquidity-Expansion KPIs including merchant activation rate and transaction volume growth."

**Lever 4 — European Spend Management Leadership:** "Pleo's ambition to be the default spend management platform for European businesses requires a Product Manager who understands multi-entity compliance, cross-border payment UX, and local market nuances. My experience in these areas accelerates Pleo's expansion timeline. I'm requesting a signing bonus of DKK 90,000 / £10,000 / €10,000 and a Real-Time Yield performance multiplier tied to market expansion milestones."
