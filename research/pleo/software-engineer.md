**Negotiation DNA**

Pleo has positioned itself as Europe's leading smart company card and spend management platform, serving over 30,000 merchants and businesses across the continent. As a Software Engineer at Pleo, you are building the foundational infrastructure that powers automated expense reporting, multi-entity support, and the Cash-Management Yield engine that generates real-time returns on customer float. This is not a typical SaaS engineering role — you are directly contributing to a fintech platform that handles real money flows, compliance requirements, and cross-border payment orchestration.

The company's pre-IPO trajectory (valued at approximately $4.7B at peak, backed by Bain Capital, Thrive Capital, and Stripes) means your equity package carries meaningful upside. Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion strategy — growing the total volume of funds flowing through the platform and optimizing yield on those funds — creates a direct line between engineering output and revenue generation. Every feature you ship that increases card adoption, reduces friction in expense workflows, or improves the real-time yield on managed funds contributes to the company's core value proposition and your negotiating leverage.

Software Engineers at Pleo work across a modern stack (TypeScript, React, Node.js, Kotlin, AWS) within autonomous squads that own end-to-end product surfaces. The Copenhagen headquarters offers a strong engineering culture with competitive Danish compensation, while London and Berlin offices provide access to deep fintech talent pools. Your negotiation should emphasize the revenue-adjacent nature of your work and the pre-IPO equity opportunity.

### Real-Time Yield — The Liquidity-Expansion Premium

**Lever 1 — Cash-Management Yield Impact:** "My work on Pleo's transaction processing infrastructure directly supports the Cash-Management Yield engine that generates returns on customer float. Each millisecond of latency I eliminate in payment processing increases the effective yield window. I'd like my base salary to reflect that I'm not just writing code — I'm building revenue-generating financial infrastructure. I'm targeting the top of the band at DKK 600,000 / £72,000 / €70,000."

**Lever 2 — Pre-IPO Equity Acceleration:** "With Pleo valued at $4.7B and backed by Bain Capital and Thrive Capital, the pre-IPO options package represents significant upside. However, I'm taking on liquidity risk by joining before a public listing. I'd like to negotiate a 25% increase in option grant to compensate for that risk, with a discussion about refresh grants tied to Liquidity-Expansion milestones."

**Lever 3 — Merchant Moat Engineering:** "Pleo's 30,000+ merchant network is a defining competitive moat. The integration and reliability work I'll do directly protects and expands this network effect. I'd like a signing bonus of DKK 70,000 / £8,000 / €8,000 to reflect the immediate value I bring to platform stability on day one."

**Lever 4 — European Spend Management Scale:** "Pleo's multi-entity, multi-currency spend management platform across Europe requires engineers who understand cross-border compliance, payment rails, and localization. My experience in these areas directly accelerates Pleo's European expansion and Liquidity-Expansion goals. I'm requesting a Real-Time Yield performance bonus tied to transaction volume growth in my product area."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of DKK 850,000 / £100,000 / €95,000 by pushing for a 15-20% increase in option grant (worth an additional $6,000-$10,000/yr in estimated value) and a signing bonus of $8,000-$10,000 to offset pre-IPO liquidity risk. Accept-at floor: DKK 700,000 / £82,000 / €80,000 total comp. Walk away below DKK 655,000 / £75,000 / €74,000. Emphasize the Cash-Management Yield revenue impact and the 30,000+ merchant moat your engineering work protects.
