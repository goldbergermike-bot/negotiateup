**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Pleo work with one of the richest financial datasets in European fintech — billions in transaction data across 30,000+ businesses, spanning categories, geographies, currencies, and spending patterns. Your analyses and models directly inform product decisions, pricing strategies, risk management, and the optimization of Pleo's Cash-Management Yield engine. This is not a dashboarding role — you are building the analytical intelligence that powers Real-Time Yield optimization and drives the Liquidity-Expansion strategy.

At Pleo's scale, data science has direct revenue impact. Your models on customer spend prediction, fraud detection, yield optimization, and churn prevention translate directly into financial outcomes. The Cash-Management Yield engine relies on sophisticated modeling of cash flows, settlement timing, and liquidity patterns to maximize returns on customer float. As the platform grows beyond 30,000+ merchants, the complexity and value of these models scales proportionally, creating a compounding returns loop that makes data science a core value driver.

Pleo's pre-IPO positioning ($4.7B peak valuation, backed by Bain Capital, Thrive Capital, and Stripes) means data scientists joining now have a meaningful equity opportunity. Your negotiation should emphasize the direct connection between your analytical work and Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion revenue — every insight that increases transaction volume, optimizes yield, or reduces churn has a quantifiable dollar impact that far exceeds your compensation.

### Real-Time Yield — The Liquidity-Expansion Premium

**Lever 1 — Yield Optimization Modeling:** "My work on Cash-Management Yield optimization models directly determines how much revenue Pleo generates from customer float. A 5-basis-point improvement in yield optimization across the platform's total managed funds creates millions in annual revenue. I'm requesting base compensation of DKK 800,000 / £95,000 / €90,000 to reflect this direct revenue-generating role."

**Lever 2 — Pre-IPO Data Equity:** "Pleo's data assets — transaction patterns across 30,000+ merchants, multi-currency spend data, and financial behavior models — are a core component of its IPO narrative. My work building the analytical infrastructure that monetizes these assets directly supports the $4.7B valuation thesis that Bain Capital and Thrive Capital have underwritten. I'd like an option grant of DKK 480,000 / £52,000 / €48,000 over four years with refresh guarantees."

**Lever 3 — Liquidity-Expansion Analytics:** "Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion strategy requires data-driven decisions about market entry, product pricing, and customer segmentation. My models on customer lifetime value, market opportunity sizing, and yield-per-merchant directly guide these strategic investments. I'd like a performance bonus of 10-15% of base tied to Real-Time Yield metrics and Liquidity-Expansion growth targets."

**Lever 4 — Financial Data Science Scarcity:** "Data Scientists with experience in fintech yield optimization, payment analytics, and regulatory modeling are rare in the European market. My skill set spans statistical modeling, financial engineering, and production ML — a combination that directly accelerates Pleo's Cash-Management Yield engine development. I'm requesting a signing bonus of DKK 80,000 / £9,000 / €9,000 to reflect the competitive market for fintech data talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of DKK 1,200,000 / £145,000 / €135,000 by negotiating a 25% increase in option grant (adding $10,000-$15,000/yr in estimated value), a signing bonus of $9,000-$12,000, and a Liquidity-Expansion performance bonus of 10-15% of base. Accept-at floor: DKK 1,000,000 / £120,000 / €112,000 total comp. Walk away below DKK 873,000 / £104,000 / €96,000. Anchor on the Cash-Management Yield optimization impact and the direct revenue linkage of fintech data science.
