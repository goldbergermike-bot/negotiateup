**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Pleo sit at the critical nexus of people leadership and technical delivery for Europe's leading spend management platform. You are responsible for building, scaling, and retaining the engineering teams that power Pleo's core systems — from the Real-Time Yield engine that generates Cash-Management Yield on customer float to the automated expense reporting workflows used by 30,000+ businesses. Your ability to hire and develop top-tier fintech engineers in competitive European markets (Copenhagen, London, Berlin) directly determines Pleo's execution velocity.

Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion strategy depends on Engineering Managers who can scale teams rapidly while maintaining technical excellence. As the company approaches a potential IPO (backed by Bain Capital, Thrive Capital, and Stripes at a $4.7B peak valuation), the demands on engineering leadership intensify. You must balance feature velocity with platform reliability, manage cross-functional relationships with Product and Design, and ensure your squads are delivering the infrastructure that drives transaction volume and yield optimization.

Your negotiation leverage comes from the difficulty of finding engineering leaders who combine deep fintech domain expertise with proven people management skills in the European market. Pleo's autonomous squad model gives Engineering Managers significant scope — you own hiring, performance, technical direction, and delivery for your teams. The pre-IPO equity opportunity is particularly compelling at this level, as Engineering Managers typically receive grants between Senior and Staff IC levels, with meaningful upside if the company's Liquidity-Expansion strategy drives a successful public listing.

### Real-Time Yield — The Liquidity-Expansion Premium

**Lever 1 — Team Velocity and Yield Impact:** "The engineering team I manage will directly build and optimize Pleo's Cash-Management Yield engine. My ability to hire, retain, and develop high-performing engineers determines how quickly Pleo can ship yield-generating features and scale the platform. I'm requesting base compensation of DKK 960,000 / £115,000 / €110,000 to reflect the revenue multiplier effect of effective engineering management."

**Lever 2 — Pre-IPO Leadership Equity:** "As an Engineering Manager at a pre-IPO company valued at $4.7B, I'm taking on both execution risk and retention risk — I need to keep my team intact through the IPO window while delivering critical Liquidity-Expansion features. I'm requesting an option grant of DKK 620,000 / £68,000 / €62,000 over four years with double-trigger acceleration, plus a guaranteed team-level equity pool I can use for retention grants."

**Lever 3 — 30,000+ Merchant Platform Scale:** "Managing engineering teams for a platform serving 30,000+ merchants across multiple European markets requires specific expertise in payment reliability, compliance, and internationalization. Every hiring decision I make and every technical bet I guide my team toward affects Pleo's competitive moat. I'd like a management performance bonus of 12-15% of base tied to platform reliability SLAs and team delivery velocity."

**Lever 4 — European Talent Market Premium:** "Engineering management talent with fintech domain expertise is exceptionally scarce in Copenhagen, London, and Berlin. I'm competing against offers from Stripe, Klarna, and Revolut. I'm requesting a signing bonus of DKK 110,000 / £13,000 / €12,000 and a commitment to annual equity refreshes that keep my total comp competitive with Liquidity-Expansion growth milestones."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of DKK 1,500,000 / £180,000 / €170,000 by negotiating a 25-30% increase in option grant (adding $15,000-$22,000/yr in estimated value), a signing bonus of $13,000-$16,000, and a management performance bonus of 12-15% of base. Accept-at floor: DKK 1,250,000 / £150,000 / €140,000 total comp. Walk away below DKK 1,105,000 / £129,000 / €121,000. Anchor on the Cash-Management Yield team delivery impact and the scarcity of fintech engineering managers in Europe.
