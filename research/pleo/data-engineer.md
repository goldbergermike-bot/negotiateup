**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Pleo build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers every analytical and operational decision across the platform. You are designing the pipelines that ingest, transform, and serve transaction data from 30,000+ businesses — feeding the Cash-Management Yield models, powering real-time fraud detection, enabling compliance reporting, and supporting the product analytics that drive feature development. In a fintech company, data infrastructure is not a support function — it is a core revenue capability that directly influences how effectively Pleo optimizes its Real-Time Yield engine.

Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion strategy generates exponentially more data as the platform scales across new European markets and financial products. Every new merchant, every new transaction, every new currency creates data that must be processed, stored, and made available with low latency and high reliability. Your data pipeline architecture determines whether Pleo can scale its analytical capabilities proportionally to its growth, or whether data becomes a bottleneck that constrains the Cash-Management Yield optimization and Liquidity-Expansion execution.

At Pleo's pre-IPO stage ($4.7B peak valuation, backed by Bain Capital, Thrive Capital, and Stripes), data infrastructure quality is a key value driver. Institutional investors and potential acquirers evaluate the maturity of a company's data platform as a proxy for its ability to scale. Your negotiation should emphasize the foundational nature of data engineering at Pleo — every team, from product to finance to compliance, depends on the infrastructure you build across the 30,000+ merchant data ecosystem.

### Real-Time Yield — The Liquidity-Expansion Premium

**Lever 1 — Yield Data Pipeline Ownership:** "The Cash-Management Yield engine depends entirely on real-time, accurate data about transaction volumes, settlement timing, and float positions. The data pipelines I build are the foundation that makes Real-Time Yield optimization possible. A pipeline outage or data quality issue directly impacts yield revenue. I'm requesting base compensation of DKK 770,000 / £92,000 / €87,000 to reflect this critical dependency."

**Lever 2 — Pre-IPO Data Infrastructure Equity:** "Pleo's data platform maturity is a key factor in its $4.7B valuation narrative. The data infrastructure I build — real-time streaming, analytical warehousing, and compliance data governance — directly supports the value proposition that Bain Capital and Thrive Capital are investing in. I'd like an option grant of DKK 440,000 / £48,000 / €44,000 over four years with refresh guarantees at 18-month intervals."

**Lever 3 — Liquidity-Expansion Data Scaling:** "As Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion drives transaction volume growth across 30,000+ merchants and new European markets, data infrastructure must scale proportionally without cost explosion. My expertise in cost-efficient data architecture — columnar storage, stream processing, and partition optimization — directly enables profitable scaling. I'd like a performance bonus of 10% of base tied to data platform scalability and cost efficiency metrics."

**Lever 4 — Fintech Data Engineering Specialization:** "Data Engineers who understand financial data governance, PCI-compliant data handling, cross-border data sovereignty (GDPR, Schrems II), and real-time transaction processing are exceptionally rare. My specialized background directly accelerates Pleo's Cash-Management Yield data infrastructure development. I'm requesting a signing bonus of DKK 75,000 / £8,500 / €8,000 and a dedicated training budget for data certifications."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of DKK 1,130,000 / £135,000 / €125,000 by negotiating a 20-25% increase in option grant (adding $8,000-$13,000/yr in estimated value), a signing bonus of $8,500-$11,000, and a data platform performance bonus of 10% of base. Accept-at floor: DKK 950,000 / £112,000 / €105,000 total comp. Walk away below DKK 825,000 / £96,000 / €92,000. Anchor on Cash-Management Yield data pipeline criticality and the Liquidity-Expansion data scaling requirements.
