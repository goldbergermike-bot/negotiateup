**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Pleo build the intelligent systems that differentiate the platform from legacy expense management tools. Your models power automated expense categorization, smart receipt matching, anomaly detection, fraud prevention, spending pattern analysis, and predictive budgeting for 30,000+ businesses across Europe. Most critically, your work directly enhances the Cash-Management Yield engine — using machine learning to optimize float management, predict cash flow patterns, and maximize the Real-Time Yield generated on customer balances.

Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion strategy creates a virtuous cycle for ML/AI: more transaction data from more merchants enables better models, which improve the product experience, which drives adoption and generates more data. As the platform scales beyond 30,000+ businesses, the ML systems you build become increasingly accurate and valuable. This data flywheel is a core component of Pleo's competitive moat and a key part of the narrative that supports the $4.7B valuation backed by Bain Capital, Thrive Capital, and Stripes.

At Pleo's pre-IPO stage, ML/AI Engineers are building the intelligent infrastructure that will define the company's next generation of products. From LLM-powered expense processing to predictive cash management to intelligent spend recommendations, your work creates the product differentiation that drives premium pricing and customer retention. Your negotiation should emphasize the revenue-generating nature of fintech ML — unlike research-oriented ML roles, every model you deploy at Pleo has a direct, measurable impact on transaction volume and yield optimization.

### Real-Time Yield — The Liquidity-Expansion Premium

**Lever 1 — Yield Optimization ML:** "My machine learning models will directly optimize Pleo's Cash-Management Yield engine by predicting cash flow patterns, optimizing settlement timing, and maximizing Real-Time Yield on customer float. A 1% improvement in yield optimization across the platform's total managed funds translates to significant annual revenue. I'm requesting base compensation of DKK 870,000 / £105,000 / €98,000 to reflect this direct revenue optimization role."

**Lever 2 — Pre-IPO AI Equity Premium:** "Pleo's ability to differentiate through AI-powered spend management is a core pillar of the $4.7B valuation that Bain Capital and Thrive Capital have backed. The ML infrastructure and models I build will be highlighted in the IPO narrative as key competitive advantages. I'd like an option grant of DKK 550,000 / £60,000 / €55,000 over four years with refresh grants tied to model performance milestones."

**Lever 3 — Liquidity-Expansion Intelligence Layer:** "As Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion drives growth across 30,000+ merchants and new European markets, the ML systems I build must generalize across diverse business types, currencies, and regulatory contexts. My ability to build robust, multi-market ML pipelines directly enables scalable growth without proportional increases in manual operations. I'd like a performance bonus of 12-15% of base tied to model performance metrics and Liquidity-Expansion automation targets."

**Lever 4 — Fintech ML Talent Scarcity:** "ML/AI Engineers who combine deep machine learning expertise with fintech domain knowledge — fraud detection, payment optimization, financial forecasting, and regulatory compliance — are among the scarcest talent in European tech. Stripe, Revolut, and Klarna are all aggressively hiring for these exact skills. I'm requesting a signing bonus of DKK 90,000 / £10,000 / €10,000 and a dedicated GPU compute budget for research and experimentation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of DKK 1,320,000 / £160,000 / €148,000 by negotiating a 25% increase in option grant (adding $12,000-$18,000/yr in estimated value), a signing bonus of $10,000-$13,000, and a model performance bonus of 12-15% of base. Accept-at floor: DKK 1,100,000 / £132,000 / €122,000 total comp. Walk away below DKK 955,000 / £112,000 / €106,000. Anchor on Cash-Management Yield optimization ML and the Liquidity-Expansion intelligent automation opportunity.
