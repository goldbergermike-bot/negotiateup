**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Pleo protect the financial infrastructure that 30,000+ businesses trust with their company spending. This is not a typical application security role — you are safeguarding a platform that processes real money, issues physical and virtual cards, manages sensitive financial data across European jurisdictions, and operates under PCI-DSS, PSD2, GDPR, and country-specific financial regulations. A security incident at Pleo doesn't just cause a data breach — it can freeze businesses' ability to spend, erode trust with banking partners, and trigger regulatory consequences across multiple countries.

Your security work directly supports the Cash-Management Yield engine by ensuring that the float management and yield optimization systems are protected against fraud, unauthorized access, and data leakage. The Real-Time Yield infrastructure processes continuous financial transactions, and every security control you implement protects not just customer data but active revenue streams. Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion into new markets compounds this responsibility, as each new country brings additional regulatory requirements and threat surfaces.

At Pleo's pre-IPO stage ($4.7B peak valuation, backed by Bain Capital, Thrive Capital, and Stripes), security readiness is a prerequisite for IPO due diligence. SOC 2, PCI-DSS compliance, and a mature security program are table stakes for institutional investors. Your negotiation should emphasize that security is a non-negotiable enabler of Pleo's growth trajectory — without your work, the Liquidity-Expansion strategy cannot proceed, and the 30,000+ merchant moat becomes a liability rather than an asset.

### Real-Time Yield — The Liquidity-Expansion Premium

**Lever 1 — Yield Infrastructure Protection:** "Pleo's Cash-Management Yield engine manages customer float and generates real-time returns — any security breach in this system doesn't just compromise data, it directly threatens revenue and customer trust. My work securing the yield infrastructure is literally protecting Pleo's revenue stream. I'm requesting base compensation of DKK 820,000 / £98,000 / €95,000 to reflect the financial criticality of this responsibility."

**Lever 2 — Pre-IPO Security Readiness:** "Pleo's path to IPO requires demonstrable security maturity — SOC 2 Type II, PCI-DSS Level 1, and compliance certifications that institutional investors demand. My work building and maintaining this security posture directly supports the $4.7B valuation that Bain Capital and Thrive Capital have underwritten. I'd like an option grant of DKK 480,000 / £52,000 / €48,000 over four years with IPO-linked acceleration."

**Lever 3 — Liquidity-Expansion Security Scaling:** "Every new European market Pleo enters through its Liquidity-Expansion strategy introduces new regulatory requirements, threat models, and compliance obligations. My expertise in cross-border financial security — spanning GDPR, PSD2, AML/KYC, and country-specific regulations — directly enables Pleo to expand safely across the 30,000+ merchant network and beyond. I'd like a performance bonus of 12% of base tied to compliance milestone achievements and incident-free operational metrics."

**Lever 4 — Fintech Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers with PCI-DSS, payment processing, and financial regulatory experience are among the most sought-after professionals in European tech. Every major fintech — Stripe, Adyen, Revolut, Klarna — is competing for this same talent. I'm requesting a signing bonus of DKK 85,000 / £10,000 / €9,000, a Real-Time Yield security performance multiplier, and a dedicated security certification budget of DKK 25,000 / £3,000 / €2,800 annually."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of DKK 1,200,000 / £148,000 / €138,000 by negotiating a 25% increase in option grant (adding $10,000-$15,000/yr in estimated value), a signing bonus of $10,000-$12,000, and a security performance bonus of 12% of base. Accept-at floor: DKK 1,000,000 / £122,000 / €115,000 total comp. Walk away below DKK 878,000 / £104,000 / €99,000. Anchor on Cash-Management Yield infrastructure protection, pre-IPO security readiness, and the Liquidity-Expansion compliance requirements.
