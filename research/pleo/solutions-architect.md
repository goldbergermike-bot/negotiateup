**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Pleo bridge the gap between Pleo's spend management platform and the complex IT ecosystems of enterprise customers. You design the integration architectures that connect Pleo's smart card and expense platform with ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite), accounting software (Xero, QuickBooks, Datev), HR platforms, and banking infrastructure across 30,000+ businesses. Your work directly expands the depth of Pleo's integration into customer workflows, which increases platform stickiness and the volume of spend flowing through the Cash-Management Yield engine.

Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion strategy depends heavily on Solutions Architects who can design scalable integration patterns for enterprise customers. As businesses grow larger and more complex — multi-entity, multi-country, multi-currency — the architecture decisions you make determine whether Pleo can capture their full spend volume or lose wallet share to fragmented point solutions. Every integration you design that automates expense flows and reduces manual reconciliation increases the Real-Time Yield opportunity by keeping more funds on the platform longer.

At Pleo's pre-IPO stage ($4.7B peak valuation, backed by Bain Capital, Thrive Capital, and Stripes), Solutions Architects are critical to the enterprise upmarket motion that drives valuation growth. Your negotiation should emphasize the direct revenue impact of integration depth — deeper integrations mean higher retention, more transaction volume, and increased Cash-Management Yield across the 30,000+ merchant network.

### Real-Time Yield — The Liquidity-Expansion Premium

**Lever 1 — Integration Depth Revenue Impact:** "Every integration I design between Pleo and enterprise ERP/accounting systems deepens the platform's moat and increases transaction volume flowing through the Cash-Management Yield engine. Deeper integrations correlate directly with higher customer retention and spend capture rates. I'm requesting base compensation of DKK 900,000 / £108,000 / €102,000 to reflect this measurable revenue impact."

**Lever 2 — Pre-IPO Enterprise Equity:** "Pleo's enterprise upmarket motion — which my Solutions Architecture work directly enables — is a key driver of the $4.7B valuation that Bain Capital and Thrive Capital have backed. As I'm joining before a potential IPO, I'd like an option grant of DKK 550,000 / £60,000 / €55,000 over four years with acceleration provisions tied to a liquidity event."

**Lever 3 — Liquidity-Expansion Enterprise Architecture:** "Scaling Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion strategy to larger enterprise customers across 30,000+ merchants requires an architect who can design multi-entity, multi-currency integration patterns that maximize spend capture. Each enterprise customer I successfully architect onto the platform represents significant recurring transaction volume. I'd like a performance bonus of 12% of base tied to enterprise integration completion and Real-Time Yield growth per customer."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Border Integration Expertise:** "Designing integration architectures that work across European regulatory environments, accounting standards, and payment rails is a specialized skill. My ability to navigate GDPR, PSD2, and country-specific accounting requirements while delivering seamless enterprise integrations accelerates Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion timeline. I'm requesting a signing bonus of DKK 90,000 / £10,000 / €10,000 and a certification/training budget of DKK 35,000 / £4,000 / €3,500 annually."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of DKK 1,350,000 / £165,000 / €150,000 by negotiating a 25% increase in option grant (adding $12,000-$18,000/yr in estimated value), a signing bonus of $10,000-$13,000, and an enterprise integration performance bonus of 12% of base. Accept-at floor: DKK 1,100,000 / £135,000 / €125,000 total comp. Walk away below DKK 985,000 / £116,000 / €109,000. Anchor on Cash-Management Yield revenue from integration depth and the Liquidity-Expansion enterprise architecture requirements.
