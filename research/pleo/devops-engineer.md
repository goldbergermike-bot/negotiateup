**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Pleo are the guardians of platform reliability for a financial system that processes real money in real time. When Pleo's infrastructure goes down, employees across 30,000+ businesses cannot access their company cards, submit expenses, or manage budgets — making uptime not just a technical metric but a financial and reputational imperative. Your work on CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, monitoring, and incident response directly supports the Cash-Management Yield engine that generates Real-Time Yield on customer float. Every second of downtime has a measurable financial cost.

Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion strategy requires infrastructure that can scale seamlessly across new European markets, handle increasing transaction volumes, and maintain the sub-second latency required for real-time payment processing. As a DevOps Engineer, you are building the platform foundations that enable this growth — from Kubernetes orchestration and AWS optimization to deployment automation and observability. The 30,000+ merchant moat is only as strong as the infrastructure that serves it.

The pre-IPO context ($4.7B peak valuation, backed by Bain Capital, Thrive Capital, and Stripes) makes this an attractive equity opportunity. DevOps Engineers who join now and build the infrastructure that supports Pleo through its growth phase and potential IPO will see meaningful returns. Your negotiation leverage comes from the critical nature of infrastructure reliability in fintech and the scarcity of DevOps talent with financial services experience in the European market.

### Real-Time Yield — The Liquidity-Expansion Premium

**Lever 1 — Yield Infrastructure Uptime:** "Pleo's Cash-Management Yield engine generates returns continuously — every minute of downtime is lost yield revenue. My work ensuring 99.99% uptime for the payment processing and float management infrastructure directly protects Pleo's revenue stream. I'm requesting base compensation of DKK 750,000 / £88,000 / €85,000 to reflect the financial criticality of platform reliability."

**Lever 2 — Pre-IPO Infrastructure Equity:** "As Pleo approaches a potential IPO, infrastructure reliability becomes a due-diligence requirement — investors and regulators will scrutinize platform uptime and incident history. The infrastructure I build now directly supports the $4.7B valuation thesis. I'd like an option grant of DKK 400,000 / £44,000 / €40,000 over four years with acceleration tied to a liquidity event, reflecting my role in de-risking the IPO."

**Lever 3 — Liquidity-Expansion Scale Engineering:** "Pleo's Liquidity-Expansion across Europe requires infrastructure that handles exponential growth in transaction volume across 30,000+ merchants and new markets. My expertise in auto-scaling, multi-region deployment, and cost optimization directly enables this growth without proportional infrastructure cost increases. I'd like a performance bonus of 10% of base tied to platform reliability SLAs and infrastructure cost efficiency."

**Lever 4 — Fintech DevOps Scarcity:** "DevOps Engineers with experience in PCI-compliant financial infrastructure, payment processing reliability, and European data sovereignty requirements are exceptionally rare. My background in regulated fintech infrastructure directly accelerates Pleo's Real-Time Yield platform reliability. I'm requesting a signing bonus of DKK 70,000 / £8,000 / €7,500 and an on-call compensation premium for production support responsibilities."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of DKK 1,080,000 / £130,000 / €120,000 by negotiating a 20-25% increase in option grant (adding $8,000-$12,000/yr in estimated value), a signing bonus of $8,000-$10,000, and a reliability performance bonus of 10% of base. Accept-at floor: DKK 900,000 / £108,000 / €100,000 total comp. Walk away below DKK 797,000 / £93,000 / €88,000. Anchor on Cash-Management Yield uptime protection and the Liquidity-Expansion infrastructure scaling requirements.
