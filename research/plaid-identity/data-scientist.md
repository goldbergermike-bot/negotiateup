### Data Scientist | Plaid Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Pre-IPO Upside | Identity-First Financial Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$205K | $160K–$260K | 10–15% | $210K–$285K |
| New York | $160K–$200K | $155K–$250K | 10–15% | $205K–$278K |
| London | £100K–£135K | £80K–£140K | 10–15% | £128K–£185K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data scientists at Plaid work with one of the richest financial datasets in the world — transaction data from 12,000+ financial institutions, spanning hundreds of millions of consumer accounts. This data powers Plaid's transaction categorization, income verification, and identity products. You're not analyzing hypothetical patterns; you're building models that determine whether someone gets approved for a loan, verified for a bank account, or flagged for fraud. The stakes are regulatory and real.

Plaid's data science team operates at the intersection of ML and compliance. Every model you build must be explainable (regulators require it), fair (bias testing is mandatory), and accurate (false positives in fraud detection have direct consumer harm). This combination of ML expertise and regulatory awareness is rare in the market — most data scientists have one skill but not both. Use this dual-expertise positioning to negotiate above-market comp.

### Identity Fraud Detection Lever

Plaid's identity verification product depends on data science models that distinguish legitimate users from fraudsters in real time. These models process document images, biometric signals, and behavioral patterns to make verification decisions in under 3 seconds. The false positive rate directly impacts user experience (legitimate users blocked), while the false negative rate impacts trust (fraudsters getting through).

If you have experience with fraud detection, document verification ML, or biometric matching, you're operating in the highest-demand niche of fintech data science. Plaid competes with Socure, Alloy, and Unit21 for this talent, and all are willing to pay premiums for proven fraud-detection expertise.

**Global Levers**

1. **Unique Dataset Access:** "Plaid has one of the richest financial datasets in the world — transaction data from 12,000+ institutions. My models will leverage data that no competitor can replicate. The value I create is multiplied by the uniqueness of this dataset."
2. **Regulatory ML Expertise:** "I build models that must be explainable, fair, and auditable. This regulatory ML expertise — understanding both the statistics and the compliance requirements — is rare and directly required for Plaid's regulated products."
3. **Fraud Detection Premium:** "Identity fraud detection data scientists command a 15-20% premium in the current market. I'm bringing proven expertise in real-time fraud scoring, document verification, and behavioral analysis."
4. **Model Impact Quantification:** "Every percentage point improvement in my fraud detection model translates to [X] fewer fraudulent verifications per month. I can quantify the dollar value of my model improvements in terms of fraud loss prevention."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $240K over 4 years with a $25K signing bonus. My fraud detection expertise directly prevents financial losses — I want the comp to reflect the revenue protection my models provide, not just the cost of a data scientist headcount." Plaid will counter at $190K-$220K equity — accept at $210K+ with the signing bonus.
