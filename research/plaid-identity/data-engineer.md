**Negotiation DNA**

Data engineers at Plaid build and maintain the pipelines that process billions of financial transactions across 12,000+ institutions. This is not standard ETL work — you're building real-time streaming infrastructure for financial data that must be accurate to the penny, delivered within SLA windows measured in seconds, and compliant with data residency regulations across multiple jurisdictions. A pipeline failure at Plaid doesn't just break a dashboard; it breaks thousands of fintech applications simultaneously.

Plaid's data infrastructure is the foundation that every product team depends on. Transaction categorization, income verification, identity signals, and fraud detection all start with clean, timely, correctly-routed financial data. Data engineers who can build pipelines that handle the scale (billions of transactions), the sensitivity (PII, bank credentials), and the regulatory requirements (SOC 2, PCI DSS, GDPR) are among the most valuable hires Plaid makes.

### Identity Data Pipeline Lever

The identity verification product generates a unique data challenge: multi-modal data (document images, biometric signals, device fingerprints, behavioral patterns) must be ingested, processed, and routed to ML models in real time. This is fundamentally different from Plaid's traditional structured transaction data — it requires image processing pipelines, feature stores for real-time inference, and compliance-aware data retention policies for biometric data.

If you have experience building ML feature pipelines, real-time streaming for inference workloads, or biometric data infrastructure, you carry a premium. The identity verification team needs data engineers who understand both the pipeline engineering and the regulatory constraints around biometric data storage and processing.

**Global Levers**

1. **Financial Data Sensitivity Premium:** "I'm building pipelines that handle PII, bank credentials, and biometric data under SOC 2, PCI DSS, and GDPR requirements. This isn't standard data engineering — it's regulated financial infrastructure with zero tolerance for data leaks."
2. **Real-Time Scale Complexity:** "Plaid processes billions of financial transactions through pipelines that must be accurate to the penny and delivered in seconds. The scale and precision requirements exceed what most data engineering roles demand."
3. **ML Feature Pipeline Expertise:** "The identity verification product needs real-time ML feature pipelines for fraud detection and document verification. I bring expertise in feature stores, streaming inference, and model-serving infrastructure."
4. **Blast Radius Awareness:** "A pipeline failure at Plaid cascades across thousands of fintech applications. My reliability engineering mindset directly protects Plaid's reputation with bank partners and developers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $225K over 4 years with a $20K signing bonus. My data pipeline work underpins every product at Plaid — the identity verification, transaction categorization, and income verification products all depend on the infrastructure I build." Plaid will counter at $180K-$210K equity — accept at $200K+ with the signing bonus.
