### Security Engineer | Plaid Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Pre-IPO Upside | Identity-First Financial Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $175K–$220K | $170K–$280K | 10–15% | $225K–$305K |
| New York | $170K–$215K | $165K–$270K | 10–15% | $220K–$298K |
| London | £110K–£145K | £85K–£150K | 10–15% | £140K–£200K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security engineers at Plaid guard the most sensitive data in fintech: bank credentials, government IDs, Social Security numbers, and biometric data for hundreds of millions of consumers. A security breach at Plaid wouldn't just be a data leak — it would be a systemic event affecting the entire fintech ecosystem, triggering regulatory investigations from the CFPB, OCC, and international equivalents. This existential risk profile means Plaid invests heavily in security, and security engineers carry disproportionate organizational influence.

Plaid maintains SOC 2 Type II, PCI DSS, and is expanding into GDPR, UK FCA, and other international compliance frameworks. Security engineers must understand both offensive security (penetration testing, threat modeling) and compliance-driven security (audit controls, evidence collection, regulatory reporting). This dual skillset is rare — most security engineers specialize in one domain. If you bring both, negotiate accordingly. [Source: Plaid Security & Compliance Team 2025-2026]

### Identity Data Protection Lever

The identity verification product handles the most sensitive data at Plaid: government-issued IDs, facial biometrics, and personally identifiable information submitted in real time. Security engineers on the identity team design the encryption, access controls, and data retention policies that protect this data. Biometric data carries special regulatory requirements (BIPA in Illinois, GDPR Article 9 in the EU) that require deep expertise in both security engineering and privacy law.

If you have experience with biometric data protection, government ID handling, or privacy-preserving ML (federated learning, differential privacy), you carry a premium that Plaid needs for its identity platform. The regulatory landscape for biometric data is evolving rapidly, and Plaid needs security engineers who can stay ahead of it.

**Global Levers**

1. **Existential Risk Framing:** "A security breach at Plaid would be a systemic fintech event. I'm the engineer preventing that scenario. My comp should reflect the catastrophic risk I'm mitigating — not the cost of a security headcount."
2. **Biometric Data Expertise:** "I have experience with biometric data protection under BIPA, GDPR Article 9, and emerging international frameworks. This regulatory security expertise is rare and directly required for Plaid's identity product."
3. **Multi-Compliance Mastery:** "I manage security across SOC 2, PCI DSS, GDPR, and FCA frameworks simultaneously. Each additional compliance framework compounds the complexity — and I handle all of them."
4. **Offensive + Compliance Dual Skill:** "I bring both offensive security (pen testing, threat modeling) and compliance security (audit controls, regulatory evidence). Most security engineers specialize in one — I deliver both, which is exactly what a regulated fintech needs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $260K over 4 years with a $30K signing bonus. Security is existential for Plaid — a breach would destroy bank-partner trust and trigger regulatory action. My comp should reflect the value of the trust I'm protecting, not the market rate for generic security roles." Plaid will counter at $210K-$245K equity — accept at $230K+ with the signing bonus.
