**Negotiation DNA**

This is Plaid's signature role for 2026 — the Identity Verification Platform Engineer. You're building the real-time verification engine that processes 100M+ identity checks annually, combining document OCR, biometric liveness detection, fraud-signal aggregation, and regulatory compliance checks into a single sub-3-second API response. This role doesn't exist at traditional fintech companies in this form: it merges computer vision, real-time ML inference, financial compliance, and platform engineering into one discipline. Plaid's identity product is the company's fastest-growing revenue line and the key differentiator for IPO positioning.

You're not building a feature — you're building the platform that transforms Plaid from a bank-linking API into the identity layer of global finance. Every verification your platform processes represents direct revenue and strengthens the fraud-signal network effect that makes Plaid's identity product increasingly defensible. Engineers on this platform are Plaid's highest-priority hires, competing for talent against Persona, Onfido, Jumio, and Socure — all of whom offer competitive packages for identity platform expertise.

**Level Mapping:** Plaid Identity Eng (Senior) = Google L4-L5 Platform = Stripe L3-L4 = Persona Senior Platform

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Identity Verification Platform Engineer builds systems that are fundamentally different from Plaid's traditional bank-linking infrastructure:
- **Multi-Modal ML Pipeline:** Orchestrating document OCR, facial biometric matching, and behavioral signals in a single real-time inference pipeline
- **Global Compliance Engine:** Building verification flows that adapt to country-specific KYC/AML requirements (US, UK, EU, APAC)
- **Fraud Signal Network:** Engineering the feedback loop that turns every verification into training data that improves the network
- **Privacy-Preserving Architecture:** Designing systems that process biometric data under BIPA, GDPR Article 9, and emerging biometric privacy laws

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue-Generating Platform Frame:** "I'm building the platform that generates Plaid's fastest-growing revenue line. Every verification my code processes represents direct revenue and strengthens the fraud-signal network. My equity should reflect this direct revenue attribution."
2. **No-Equivalent-Role Scarcity:** "This role combines computer vision, real-time ML, financial compliance, and platform engineering. There's no direct comp benchmark — I'm defining the market rate for identity verification platform engineering at this scale."
3. **Identity AI Premium (15-30%):** "I'm not just building APIs — I'm building the AI platform that makes Plaid the identity layer of global finance. This is the definition of the identity AI premium. I want the full 30% applied."
4. **Pre-IPO Strategic Impact:** "Plaid's identity product is the key differentiator for IPO positioning. I'm building the platform that determines whether investors value Plaid as a bank-linking API or as the identity infrastructure of finance. That valuation difference is billions of dollars."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building Plaid's most strategic platform — the one that transforms the company's identity and IPO narrative. I'd like the RSU grant at $440K over 4 years, with the Identity AI premium fully applied, plus a $50K signing bonus to offset pre-IPO illiquidity. I also want a guaranteed first-year refresh commitment and an IPO acceleration clause." Plaid will counter at $360K-$400K RSUs — accept at $380K+ with the signing bonus and the acceleration clause. This is the highest-leverage role at Plaid.
