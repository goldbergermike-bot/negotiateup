### ML/AI Engineer | Plaid Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Pre-IPO Upside | Identity-First Financial Infrastructure

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI engineers at Plaid build the models that power the company's highest-value products: transaction categorization (classifying millions of transactions per day), income verification (determining creditworthiness for lenders), identity verification (detecting fraudulent documents and synthetic identities), and risk scoring (real-time fraud detection). These models have direct financial consequences — a miscategorized transaction can trigger an incorrect credit decision, and a missed fraud signal can cost millions.

The ML talent war in fintech is intense. Plaid competes with Stripe (ML for payments fraud), Block (ML for Cash App), and the big banks' internal ML teams, plus Big Tech companies offering liquid RSUs. Plaid's advantage is the dataset: transaction data from 12,000+ financial institutions creates a moat that no competitor can replicate. Frame your interest in Plaid as access to this unique dataset, and negotiate the equity to match the value you'll create with it. [Source: Plaid AI/ML Team, Research Publications 2025-2026]

### Identity AI Model Lever

Plaid's identity verification product is the company's most ML-intensive product. It combines computer vision (document OCR, liveness detection), NLP (name matching across languages), and behavioral ML (device fingerprinting, session analysis) into a single real-time verification pipeline. The models must operate in under 3 seconds, handle 100M+ verifications annually, and maintain false positive/negative rates that satisfy both regulators and users.

ML/AI engineers on the identity team are building the core AI that determines whether Plaid becomes the default identity layer for financial services. If you have experience with document verification, biometric ML, or real-time fraud scoring, you're in the top 5% of candidates for this role. Negotiate accordingly.

**Global Levers**

1. **Unique Financial Dataset Access:** "Plaid's dataset — transactions from 12,000+ institutions — is the richest financial ML training set in the world. The models I build on this dataset will have capabilities no competitor can replicate. My equity should reflect the unique value creation this data enables."
2. **AI/ML Talent War Premium:** "ML engineers with financial domain expertise are the scarcest talent in fintech. I have competing interest from Stripe, Block, and Big Tech. Plaid needs to offer a meaningful premium over liquid RSU alternatives."
3. **Identity AI Specialization:** "I bring expertise in document verification, biometric ML, and real-time fraud scoring. This identity AI specialization is directly what Plaid needs for its fastest-growing product — and fewer than 100 engineers globally have this exact combination."
4. **Model Impact Quantification:** "I can quantify my model improvements in dollars: every 1% improvement in fraud detection saves $X annually, and every 1% improvement in verification completion rate generates $Y in additional revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $320K over 4 years with a $35K signing bonus. I'm an ML engineer with financial domain expertise and identity AI specialization — this combination is exceptionally rare. I want the equity sized to reflect the revenue impact of the models I'll build, not the cost of a generic ML hire." Plaid will counter at $260K-$300K equity — accept at $280K+ with the signing bonus.
