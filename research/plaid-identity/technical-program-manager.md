**Negotiation DNA**

Technical program managers at Plaid coordinate the most complex cross-functional initiatives in fintech: bank-partner integrations (each major bank requires 3-6 months of custom integration work), regulatory compliance programs (SOC 2 audits, PCI DSS recertification, international compliance expansion), and platform migrations that affect thousands of downstream applications. A TPM at Plaid doesn't just manage timelines — you manage dependencies across engineering, bank partnerships, legal, compliance, and product teams simultaneously.

Plaid's 2026 priorities — international expansion, identity verification scaling, and enterprise upmarket motion — all require heavy TPM investment. Each of these initiatives involves external stakeholders (regulators, bank partners, enterprise customers) with their own timelines and requirements that Plaid can't control. TPMs who can navigate this external dependency complexity are rare and highly valued. [Source: Plaid Program Management, 2025-2026]

### Identity Program Coordination Lever

The identity verification product's expansion requires coordinating across document verification vendors, biometric providers, regulatory bodies (in each new country), and internal engineering teams. A TPM on the identity program manages a dependency graph that spans internal engineering, external vendors, and government regulators — all with different timelines, incentives, and communication styles.

If you have experience managing programs with regulatory dependencies (healthcare, banking, government), you understand the unique challenge of timelines that are dictated by external stakeholders. This regulatory program management expertise is exactly what Plaid needs for identity verification expansion into new markets.

**Global Levers**

1. **External Dependency Management:** "I manage programs with regulatory, bank-partner, and vendor dependencies that Plaid can't control. This external-facing program management is fundamentally different from — and more complex than — internal-only TPM roles."
2. **International Expansion Coordination:** "Plaid's 2026 international expansion requires coordinating across UK FCA, EU regulators, and local bank partners simultaneously. I bring cross-border program management experience that directly enables this expansion."
3. **Compliance Program Expertise:** "I've managed SOC 2 audits, regulatory submissions, and compliance programs with hard external deadlines. This regulatory TPM expertise ensures Plaid meets compliance milestones without engineering velocity loss."
4. **Multi-Stakeholder Orchestration:** "I coordinate across engineering, legal, compliance, bank partnerships, and product simultaneously. This multi-stakeholder orchestration skill is essential for Plaid's most strategic initiatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $235K over 4 years with a $20K signing bonus. My program management directly enables Plaid's highest-priority initiatives — international expansion and identity platform scaling. I want the equity sized to reflect the strategic programs I'll drive, not the market rate for a generic TPM role." Plaid will counter at $185K-$215K equity — accept at $205K+ with the signing bonus.
