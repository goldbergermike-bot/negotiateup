**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions architects at Plaid bridge the gap between the API platform and enterprise customers. You're not just explaining documentation — you're designing custom integration architectures for banks, neobanks, and fintech companies that need to connect Plaid's APIs to their existing infrastructure. This requires deep understanding of banking systems (core banking platforms, payment rails, compliance workflows) combined with modern API design and cloud architecture expertise.

Plaid's enterprise sales motion is accelerating as the company moves upmarket from startup customers to large financial institutions. Solutions architects are critical to this shift — a bank like Chase or Wells Fargo won't integrate Plaid based on documentation alone. They need a dedicated technical partner who understands their legacy systems and can design an integration that meets their compliance requirements. Your ability to close enterprise deals through technical credibility directly drives Plaid's revenue growth. [Source: Plaid Enterprise Sales & Solutions Team 2025-2026]

### Identity Enterprise Integration Lever

The identity verification product is Plaid's biggest enterprise upsell opportunity. Banks and large fintechs need custom identity verification workflows that integrate with their existing KYC/AML processes, compliance systems, and customer onboarding flows. Solutions architects who can design these integrations — understanding both Plaid's identity APIs and the customer's compliance requirements — directly drive enterprise contract values.

If you have experience integrating identity or compliance systems at a bank or large fintech, you're uniquely qualified. The ability to speak both "Plaid API" and "bank compliance" is rare and directly translates to larger deal sizes.

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Revenue Attribution:** "I directly enable enterprise deal closures through technical credibility. Each enterprise integration I design represents $500K-$5M in annual contract value. My comp should reflect the revenue I directly influence."
2. **Banking System Expertise:** "I understand core banking platforms, payment rails, and compliance workflows. This institutional knowledge takes years to develop and is essential for Plaid's enterprise expansion."
3. **Identity Integration Specialization:** "I can design custom identity verification integrations that connect Plaid's APIs to enterprise KYC/AML workflows. This identity compliance integration expertise directly drives Plaid's highest-value product upsell."
4. **Pre-Sales Technical Credibility:** "When a bank evaluates Plaid, I'm the person in the room who builds trust. My technical credibility directly determines whether enterprise prospects become customers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $245K over 4 years with a $25K signing bonus and clarity on the sales bonus structure — specifically, is there a commission or SPF for deals I help close? I directly influence enterprise contract values, and I want comp that reflects both the solutions architecture work and the revenue impact." Plaid will counter at $195K-$225K equity — accept at $215K+ with the signing bonus and written clarity on the sales bonus.
