**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Zuora protect a platform that processes billions of dollars in subscription billing transactions and stores payment credentials for millions of subscribers. The security stakes are high: Zuora handles PCI-regulated payment data, sensitive financial information, and billing configurations that directly affect customer revenue. A security breach at Zuora could expose payment data for millions of consumers, trigger regulatory enforcement, and destroy customer trust in the subscription billing platform.

Zuora compensates Security Engineers at a premium over standard engineering roles (10-15% higher), reflecting both the security talent shortage and the critical nature of financial data protection. The company maintains PCI DSS Level 1 certification, SOC 2 Type II, and other compliance certifications, and security engineers are responsible for maintaining these while keeping pace with platform evolution.

At Zuora's size, security engineers have broad scope — you might work across application security, cloud infrastructure security, payment security, and compliance in a single role. This breadth creates valuable career development and negotiation leverage, as engineers who can cover multiple security domains are more impactful at mid-sized companies.

**Level Mapping:** Zuora IC3/IC4 (Security) ~ Chargebee Senior/Staff Security | Stripe Security | Braintree Senior/Staff Security | Recurly Lead Security

**Zuora Payment Security Premium**
Security Engineers with PCI DSS expertise — particularly Level 1 merchant/service provider compliance, tokenization architecture, and payment data encryption — have exceptional leverage at Zuora. PCI compliance is mandatory for Zuora's business, and finding security engineers who deeply understand PCI requirements and can implement them efficiently is genuinely difficult.

Engineers with experience in fintech security — fraud detection, transaction monitoring, or payment authorization security — bring additional value. If you've secured payment processing systems at companies like Stripe, Braintree, Adyen, or any large payment processor, this experience is directly transferable.

**Global Levers**
1. **PCI DSS Expertise:** "I bring deep expertise in PCI DSS compliance — [Level 1 certification/tokenization architecture/cardholder data protection]. This is mandatory for Zuora's business and reduces compliance risk."
2. **Financial Platform Security:** "I've secured [payment processing/billing/financial transaction] systems at [company]. The security requirements for financial platforms are more stringent than standard SaaS, and I understand these requirements."
3. **Broad Security Scope:** "At Zuora's size, I can contribute across application security, infrastructure security, and payment security. This breadth of impact justifies premium compensation."
4. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers with fintech/payment expertise are among the scarcest profiles in tech. My competing offers at $X reflect this market premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Given my expertise in [PCI DSS compliance/payment security/financial platform protection], I'm targeting total compensation of $260K. Security engineers who can protect a subscription billing platform handling billions in transactions are in exceptional demand. My floor is $238K in total comp. I'd welcome additional RSUs and a sign-on bonus."
