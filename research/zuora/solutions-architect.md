**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Zuora design the subscription billing architectures that help enterprises monetize their recurring revenue businesses. The role requires understanding Zuora's platform deeply — subscription management, billing rules, payment processing, revenue recognition, and analytics — while also understanding each customer's unique business model, ERP integrations (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite), and payment ecosystem. SAs work with the largest enterprise customers designing solutions that handle millions of subscribers and complex pricing models.

Zuora compensates SAs at levels that reflect the revenue influence of the role. SAs are directly involved in enterprise deals, and their solution designs often determine whether a customer chooses Zuora over competitors like Chargebee, Recurly, or building a custom billing system. This deal influence translates to premium compensation, often including sales-influenced bonuses.

The SA role at Zuora requires a rare combination of billing domain expertise, technical architecture skills, and business consulting ability. SAs must understand diverse subscription business models (SaaS, media, IoT, manufacturing-as-a-service) and design billing architectures that support complex pricing strategies.

SAs with experience integrating Zuora (or comparable billing platforms) with major ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite) bring immediately actionable expertise. Enterprise customers' most common deployment challenge is getting billing data to flow accurately into their financial systems.
