**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Zuora work with one of the most valuable datasets in the subscription economy — transactional and behavioral data from thousands of subscription businesses across every industry. This data powers predictive models for churn, expansion revenue, pricing optimization, and customer lifetime value that are either used internally to improve Zuora's products or embedded into Zuora's analytics offerings for customers. The analytical opportunities are distinctive: understanding why subscribers churn, how pricing changes affect revenue, and what subscription metrics predict business health.

Zuora compensates Data Scientists competitively for a company of its size, with packages that reflect the Bay Area market for on-site roles. The company values Data Scientists who can bridge internal analytics (product metrics, customer health, pricing analysis) and product-embedded intelligence (subscription analytics features sold to customers). Data Scientists who contribute to customer-facing features command higher compensation.

The unique appeal is the depth of subscription data. Zuora sees patterns across thousands of subscription businesses, creating opportunities for cross-company benchmarking and industry-level insights that no single subscription company could generate from its own data alone.

**Zuora Subscription Intelligence Premium**
Data Scientists who bring expertise in subscription analytics — churn modeling, cohort analysis, pricing elasticity, customer lifetime value prediction, or revenue forecasting — have specialized leverage. These skills directly support both Zuora's internal analytics needs and its customer-facing Zuora Analytics product. If you've built subscription metric models at a SaaS company or subscription business, this experience is directly transferable.

Data Scientists with experience in causal inference for pricing decisions are in particular demand, as Zuora's customers frequently need guidance on pricing and packaging changes that affect subscriber behavior. If you can design and analyze pricing experiments or build pricing optimization models, this capability directly enhances Zuora's value proposition to customers.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Given my expertise in [subscription analytics/churn prediction/pricing science], I'm targeting total compensation of $248K.
