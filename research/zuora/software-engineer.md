**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Zuora build the subscription billing and revenue management platform that powers the recurring economy. As an SWE at Zuora, you contribute to features across the billing engine, subscription management, payment processing, revenue recognition, or platform infrastructure. The engineering challenges are real: building financial software requires a level of precision and reliability that most SaaS applications don't demand, and the domain complexity of subscription billing provides interesting technical problems.

Zuora's base SWE compensation reflects its $2B market cap and smaller company profile, with total comp of $155K-$235K for Bay Area roles. This is competitive within the subscription billing/fintech sector, though below larger enterprise software peers. The trade-off is significant: at Zuora's size, SWEs have more ownership, faster career growth, and more direct impact than at larger companies. Your code ships to customers faster, and your contributions are more visible.

Zuora's tech stack includes Java/Kotlin for backend services, React for frontend, PostgreSQL and MongoDB for data storage, and AWS for cloud infrastructure. The engineering culture values code quality, testing, and domain understanding — engineers are encouraged to develop deep knowledge of subscription billing and the subscription economy.

**Zuora Platform Premium**
Software Engineers who bring experience with financial systems, billing software, or payment technology can negotiate above standard bands. Understanding the precision requirements of financial calculations, the compliance dimensions of payment processing, and the architectural patterns of billing systems provides immediate value that general-purpose SWEs may need months to develop.

Engineers proficient in Java or Kotlin have a stack alignment advantage, and those with experience in API design for platform products (Zuora's API is a critical product interface) bring additional value.
