**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at UnitedHealth Group design experiences that directly impact how 150M+ members interact with their healthcare — from finding doctors and understanding benefits to managing claims and accessing virtual care. Healthcare UX is uniquely challenging: designers must navigate health literacy barriers, accessibility requirements (ADA/WCAG), regulatory constraints (CMS member communication rules), and the emotional weight of designing for people in vulnerable health situations. UHG's design organization spans consumer-facing applications (myUHC app, UHC.com), provider-facing tools (claims portals, pre-authorization workflows), and internal operations tools. The company has invested in design maturity, building a healthcare design system and hiring experienced designers who can balance user needs with regulatory and business constraints. UHG competes with health tech startups (Oscar, Hims, Ro) and Big Tech health divisions for design talent. [Source: UHG Digital Experience Strategy 2025]

**Level Mapping:** UHG Product Designer = Google L3-L4 UX = Meta IC4 Design = Optum T3-T4 Design

**Global Levers**

1. **Healthcare UX Complexity Premium:** "Designing for healthcare isn't designing for e-commerce. I navigate health literacy constraints, ADA/WCAG accessibility mandates, CMS communication regulations, and the emotional complexity of health-related interactions. This domain expertise takes years to develop."
2. **Member Experience Revenue Link:** "UHG's member retention directly correlates with digital experience quality. Every member who switches insurers due to poor UX represents thousands in lost annual premium revenue. My design work directly impacts member retention and NPS."
3. **Design System Strategic Value:** "If I'm contributing to or leading UHG's healthcare design system, I'm creating leverage across every product team. One design system improvement multiplies across dozens of applications and millions of users."
4. **Health Tech Startup Counter:** "Health tech startups (Oscar, Hims, Ro, Noom) are hiring healthcare designers at $140K-$180K base in competitive markets. UHG needs to match market rates to attract designers who understand healthcare UX."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $160K with RSUs at $85K/4yr and a 15% bonus target. My healthcare design portfolio — including [specific health UX projects] — demonstrates I can design compliant, accessible, user-centered healthcare experiences from day one." UHG will counter at $130K-$150K base with $50K-$75K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $180K. Push on base salary — design roles have less RSU flexibility than engineering at UHG.
