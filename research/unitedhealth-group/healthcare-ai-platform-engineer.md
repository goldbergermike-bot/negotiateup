### Healthcare AI Platform Engineer | UnitedHealth Group Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Health Insurance Giant / Bonus-Heavy Comp / RSU Growing | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+10-20% AI/ML PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Minnetonka MN | $155K–$195K | $80K–$180K/4yr | 15–20% | $200K–$310K |
| Dallas TX | $150K–$190K | $75K–$170K/4yr | 15–20% | $195K–$300K |
| Remote US | $145K–$185K | $70K–$160K/4yr | 15–20% | $185K–$290K |

**Negotiation DNA**

UnitedHealth Group is the largest US health insurer with a $530B market cap, and its AI investment is accelerating across both the insurance (UnitedHealthcare) and technology (Optum) arms. Healthcare AI Platform Engineers sit at the intersection of clinical data, payer operations, and machine learning infrastructure — building systems that process claims, predict member health risks, optimize care pathways, and power clinical decision support. UHG has invested billions in AI/ML capabilities, viewing them as core to reducing the $4.3 trillion US healthcare cost curve. This role is strategically critical because regulatory pressure (CMS price transparency, prior authorization automation mandates) is forcing UHG to deploy AI at scale across its 150M+ member base. Engineers in this role have unusual leverage because healthcare AI talent must combine ML engineering skills with deep understanding of HIPAA, PHI handling, and clinical workflows — a rare combination.

**Level Mapping:** UHG Senior Engineer (AI) = Google L4-L5 = Meta E4-E5 = Optum T5-T6

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Healthcare AI Platform Engineer at UHG builds ML systems with direct impact on 150M+ insured lives:
- **Claims Intelligence:** ML models processing billions of claims annually for fraud detection, auto-adjudication, and cost prediction
- **Clinical Decision Support:** AI systems that assist care providers with treatment recommendations and risk stratification
- **Regulatory AI:** Building explainable AI systems that satisfy CMS and state insurance department audit requirements
- **PHI-Scale Data:** Working with one of the largest healthcare datasets in the world under strict HIPAA/HITRUST controls

**Global Levers**

1. **Healthcare AI Scarcity Frame:** "Engineers who can build production ML systems AND navigate HIPAA/PHI compliance are exceptionally rare. I'm not a generic ML engineer — I bring healthcare-domain AI expertise that eliminates the 12-18 month ramp-up of training a general technologist on healthcare data regulations."
2. **Regulatory Pressure Leverage:** "CMS is mandating AI transparency and prior authorization automation timelines. UHG needs engineers who can build compliant AI systems on deadline — this isn't optional investment, it's regulatory compliance. My comp should reflect the urgency and mandatory nature of this work."
3. **Optum Counter-Offer Frame:** "Optum's tech-focused compensation bands are 15-25% higher than parent UHG for equivalent AI roles. I'm choosing UHG for the strategic scope across the full enterprise, but my comp should close that gap — or I'll pursue the Optum equivalent."
4. **Member Impact Quantification:** "The AI platform I'll build directly impacts healthcare cost management across 150M+ members. Even a 0.1% improvement in claims accuracy translates to hundreds of millions in savings. My compensation should reflect infrastructure-level impact, not individual contributor output."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm bringing specialized healthcare AI expertise to UHG's most strategically important technology initiative. I'd like the base at $190K with RSUs at $160K/4yr and a 20% bonus target. My healthcare ML experience at [current company] means I can ship production models in Q1, not Q3." UHG will counter at $165K-$180K base with $100K-$140K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $250K. Push hard on the bonus percentage — UHG has flexibility to move from 15% to 20% for AI roles, and that 5% delta compounds annually.
