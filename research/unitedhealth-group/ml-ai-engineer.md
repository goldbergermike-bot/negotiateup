**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at UnitedHealth Group build and deploy machine learning models at a scale few healthcare organizations can match — 150M+ members, petabytes of claims/clinical/pharmacy data, and real-time inference requirements for claims adjudication and clinical decision support. The role combines traditional ML engineering (model training, feature engineering, model serving infrastructure) with healthcare-specific requirements: model explainability for clinical applications, bias testing for healthcare equity, HIPAA-compliant ML pipelines, and FDA/CMS regulatory awareness for clinical AI. UHG has invested billions in AI capabilities, driven by CEO Andrew Witty's vision of AI-powered healthcare. ML/AI engineers here work on fraud detection, prior authorization automation, member risk prediction, clinical NLP, and care pathway optimization. The AI/ML premium at UHG is real — these roles pay 10-20% above standard SWE bands because healthcare AI talent is scarce and the business impact is enormous.

**Level Mapping:** UHG ML/AI Engineer = Google L4 ML = Meta ML4 = Optum T4-T5 ML Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **Healthcare AI Scarcity Premium:** "ML engineers who understand healthcare data, HIPAA compliance, and clinical workflow integration are rare. I'm not a generic ML engineer learning healthcare on the job — I bring [specific healthcare ML experience] that eliminates the 12-18 month domain ramp."
2. **Regulatory AI Requirements:** "CMS is mandating AI transparency and bias testing for healthcare algorithms. UHG needs ML engineers who can build explainable, auditable models that satisfy regulatory requirements. This regulatory expertise commands a premium above standard ML engineering comp."
3. **Model Impact Quantification:** "ML models at UHG directly impact the medical loss ratio — the single most important financial metric for a health insurer. A fraud detection model that improves accuracy by 1% saves tens of millions annually. My work has direct, measurable P&L impact."
4. **Optum AI Benchmark:** "Optum's ML/AI engineering roles are benchmarked 15-25% above UHG parent. My work feeds the same AI capabilities that Optum productizes. The comp should reflect the Optum AI band, not the UHG corporate engineering band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $195K with RSUs at $150K/4yr and an 18% bonus target. My healthcare ML experience — specifically [model type] deployed in production at [current company] — means I can deliver production AI models in Q1, not Q4." UHG will counter at $160K-$180K base with $80K-$120K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $240K. Push for the AI/ML premium explicitly — ask the recruiter to confirm the AI band differential.
