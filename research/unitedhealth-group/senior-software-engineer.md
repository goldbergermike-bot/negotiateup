### Senior Software Engineer | UnitedHealth Group Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Health Insurance Giant / Bonus-Heavy Comp / RSU Growing | Senior IC Track

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Minnetonka MN | $145K–$195K | $60K–$160K/4yr | 12–18% | $185K–$295K |
| Dallas TX | $140K–$190K | $55K–$150K/4yr | 12–18% | $180K–$285K |
| Remote US | $135K–$180K | $50K–$140K/4yr | 12–18% | $170K–$270K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at UnitedHealth Group are the backbone of the company's technology transformation. UHG has been aggressively modernizing its tech stack — migrating from legacy mainframe systems to cloud-native architectures, building microservices, and adopting modern CI/CD practices. Senior engineers are expected to lead technical design, mentor junior engineers, and drive architectural decisions for systems that touch healthcare claims, eligibility verification, provider network management, and member-facing applications. The $530B company relies heavily on senior ICs to bridge the gap between legacy institutional knowledge and modern engineering practices. UHG's comp at the senior level has improved significantly as the company competes with Optum, health tech startups, and traditional Big Tech for experienced engineers.

**Level Mapping:** UHG Senior Engineer = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Optum T4-T5 = Epic Senior Developer

**Global Levers**

1. **Modernization Leadership Frame:** "UHG is in the middle of a massive cloud migration and platform modernization effort. Senior engineers who can lead this transformation — not just write code, but architect systems and mentor teams — command a premium. I bring [X years] of cloud-native architecture experience that directly accelerates your modernization timeline."
2. **Optum Parity Push:** "Optum T5 Senior Engineers earn 15-20% more than equivalent UHG senior roles. I'm choosing UHG for the enterprise scope, but I need comp that reflects the Optum benchmark — otherwise the rational move is to pursue the Optum equivalent role."
3. **RSU Growth Trajectory:** "UHG has been increasing RSU grants for senior engineers year over year. I'd like the RSU component at $140K/4yr to reflect the current market rate for senior healthcare engineers, not the legacy band that was set before UHG's equity compensation expansion."
4. **Retention Economics Frame:** "Replacing a senior engineer at UHG costs 6-12 months of productivity plus recruiting costs. The incremental $15K-$20K I'm asking for in base salary is a rounding error compared to the cost of a mis-hire or a senior engineer leaving after 12 months because their comp fell below market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $190K with RSUs at $140K/4yr and an 18% bonus target. My track record of leading cloud migration and platform architecture work at [current company] means I can take ownership of [specific UHG system/initiative] from day one." UHG will counter at $160K-$180K base with $80K-$120K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $235K. Push on the RSU grant — it's where UHG has the most room to flex for senior talent.
