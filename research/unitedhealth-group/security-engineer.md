**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at UnitedHealth Group protect one of the most valuable and heavily targeted datasets in the world — PHI (Protected Health Information) for 150M+ members. The 2024 Change Healthcare breach (a UHG subsidiary) was one of the largest healthcare data breaches in history, creating massive organizational urgency around cybersecurity investment. UHG has committed billions to security remediation and hardening. Security engineers here work across application security, cloud security, network security, identity/access management, threat detection, and incident response — all within the complex regulatory framework of HIPAA, HITRUST, SOC 2, and state privacy laws. Healthcare security engineering commands a significant premium over general enterprise security because of the regulatory overlay, the sensitivity of PHI data, and the massive attack surface of a $530B healthcare company. UHG is aggressively hiring security talent and willing to pay above historical bands. [Source: UHG Cybersecurity Investment Program 2025, Change Healthcare Incident Report]

**Level Mapping:** UHG Security Engineer = Google L4 Security = Optum T4-T5 Security = Palo Alto Networks Mid-Senior

**Global Levers**

1. **Post-Breach Investment Urgency:** "The Change Healthcare incident demonstrated that UHG's security posture is a board-level priority. Every security engineer hired now is part of a massive remediation and hardening program. The urgency premium should be reflected in both base salary and RSU grants — this isn't business-as-usual hiring."
2. **HIPAA/PHI Specialization Premium:** "Healthcare security isn't general enterprise security. I navigate HIPAA Security Rule requirements, HITRUST certification, PHI data classification, and CMS cybersecurity mandates. This regulatory security expertise commands a 15-20% premium over standard security engineering roles."
3. **Attack Surface Scale Frame:** "UHG's attack surface spans 150M+ member records, provider networks, pharmacy systems, claims infrastructure, and thousands of internal applications. The scale and sensitivity of what I'm protecting justify top-of-band compensation."
4. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "There's a global shortage of 3.4 million cybersecurity professionals (ISC2 2025). Healthcare security engineers with HIPAA/HITRUST expertise are an even smaller subset. I have active interest from [competing healthcare/security companies] — UHG's offer needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Given UHG's post-Change Healthcare security investment priority, I'd like the base at $190K with RSUs at $135K/4yr and an 18% bonus target. My experience in healthcare security — specifically [HIPAA compliance / incident response / cloud security] at [current company] — directly addresses UHG's most urgent security needs." UHG will counter at $155K-$175K base with $70K-$110K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $235K. Push hard on both base and RSU — security is the one area where UHG is willing to exceed historical bands due to post-breach urgency.
