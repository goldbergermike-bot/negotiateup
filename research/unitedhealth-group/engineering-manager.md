### Engineering Manager | UnitedHealth Group Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Health Insurance Giant / Bonus-Heavy Comp / RSU Growing | People Leadership Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Minnetonka MN | $160K–$215K | $80K–$200K/4yr | 15–25% | $220K–$340K |
| Dallas TX | $155K–$210K | $75K–$190K/4yr | 15–25% | $215K–$330K |
| Remote US | $150K–$200K | $70K–$180K/4yr | 15–25% | $205K–$315K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at UnitedHealth Group lead teams of 6-15 engineers building healthcare technology that serves 150M+ members. The role spans people management, technical strategy, cross-functional delivery, and organizational scaling. UHG's engineering management culture emphasizes delivery predictability, compliance awareness, and talent development — managers are evaluated on team velocity, attrition rates, and the ability to navigate UHG's complex organizational structure (matrixed across UnitedHealthcare, Optum, and corporate tech). EMs at UHG face a unique challenge: balancing innovation speed with healthcare regulatory compliance. The $530B company offers strong comp for EMs, with bonus targets significantly higher than IC roles — 15-25% vs 10-15% — making the bonus target a critical negotiation lever. UHG actively competes with Optum, health tech companies, and Big Tech for experienced engineering leaders. [Source: UHG Engineering Leadership Framework 2025]

**Level Mapping:** UHG Engineering Manager = Google L5 EM = Meta M1 = Optum T5-T6 Manager

**Global Levers**

1. **Team Size and Scope Frame:** "I'll be managing [X] engineers delivering [specific product/platform]. The scope of this team — measured by headcount, budget, and business impact — aligns with Director-level management at smaller companies. My comp should reflect the actual scope, not just the title."
2. **Bonus Target Maximization:** "Engineering Managers at UHG have bonus targets of 15-25%. I'd like the target at 25% — the top of band — given my track record of [specific delivery metrics] and the critical nature of the team I'm leading. The difference between 15% and 25% on a $200K base is $20K/year."
3. **Attrition Cost Leverage:** "Good EMs reduce attrition by 30-50%. At UHG's scale, each engineer retained saves $150K-$250K in recruiting and ramp costs. My leadership directly affects UHG's engineering cost structure — my comp is an investment in retention economics."
4. **Optum EM Parity:** "Optum Engineering Managers at equivalent scope earn 15-20% more than UHG parent. If my team delivers work that feeds Optum products, my comp should be benchmarked against Optum EM bands."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $210K with RSUs at $180K/4yr and a 25% bonus target. My experience managing [team size] engineers delivering [specific outcomes] at [current company] means I can take ownership of your team from day one and reduce the hiring/ramp costs of a management transition." UHG will counter at $175K-$195K base with $100K-$150K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $280K. The bonus target is your strongest lever — push hard for 25% vs 15%.
