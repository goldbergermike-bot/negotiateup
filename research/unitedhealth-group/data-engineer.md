### Data Engineer | UnitedHealth Group Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Health Insurance Giant / Bonus-Heavy Comp / RSU Growing | Healthcare Data at Scale

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Minnetonka MN | $130K–$180K | $45K–$130K/4yr | 10–15% | $160K–$260K |
| Dallas TX | $125K–$175K | $40K–$120K/4yr | 10–15% | $155K–$250K |
| Remote US | $120K–$170K | $35K–$115K/4yr | 10–15% | $145K–$240K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at UnitedHealth Group build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers one of the largest healthcare datasets in the world. UHG processes claims, eligibility, clinical, pharmacy, and behavioral health data for 150M+ members — generating petabytes of structured and unstructured data annually. Data engineers here build ETL/ELT pipelines, data lakes, real-time streaming platforms, and data quality frameworks that feed analytics, actuarial models, clinical decision support, and regulatory reporting. The role requires not just standard data engineering skills (Spark, Airflow, Snowflake, Databricks) but deep understanding of healthcare data standards (HL7 FHIR, X12 EDI, ICD-10, CPT codes) and HIPAA compliance for PHI data handling. UHG's data infrastructure is a competitive moat — no startup can replicate the breadth and depth of this data asset. [Source: UHG Data & Analytics Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** UHG Data Engineer = Google L3-L4 DE = Optum T3-T4 DE = Databricks IC3

**Global Levers**

1. **Healthcare Data Complexity Frame:** "Healthcare data engineering is not generic data engineering. I work with HL7 FHIR, X12 EDI transactions, ICD-10 coding, and PHI data under HIPAA — this domain expertise takes years to develop and commands a premium over standard data engineering roles."
2. **Data Asset Moat Argument:** "UHG's data asset is one of its strongest competitive moats — 150M+ member records, decades of claims history, clinical and pharmacy data. I'm building and maintaining the infrastructure that makes this moat functional. My comp should reflect the strategic value of the data platform, not just the cost of pipeline engineering."
3. **Optum Analytics Benchmark:** "Optum's data engineering roles pay 15-20% above UHG parent for equivalent work. If this role feeds Optum analytics products, the comp should align with Optum bands, not UHG corporate IT bands."
4. **Regulatory Data Requirements:** "CMS interoperability rules and state mandates are creating mandatory data engineering timelines. This isn't discretionary work — it's regulatory compliance. The urgency premium should be reflected in both base and bonus target."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $175K with RSUs at $110K/4yr and a 15% bonus target. My experience building healthcare data pipelines with [HL7 FHIR / EDI / HIPAA compliance] at [current company] means I can deliver on UHG's data infrastructure roadmap without the 6-month healthcare domain ramp-up." UHG will counter at $145K-$165K base with $60K-$90K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $200K. Push hardest on base salary — data engineers at healthcare companies have strong base salary leverage because the domain expertise premium is real.
