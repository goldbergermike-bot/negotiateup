**Negotiation DNA**

UnitedHealth Group ($530B market cap) is the largest US health insurer and one of the largest employers of software engineers in healthcare. Software Engineers at UHG build systems spanning claims processing, member portals, provider networks, and internal tooling across both UnitedHealthcare (insurance) and corporate technology organizations. UHG has historically compensated below Big Tech, but has been aggressively increasing RSU grants and base salary bands to compete for talent, particularly since Optum (its tech subsidiary) sets a higher market rate internally. The company processes over $300B in annual claims and serves 150M+ members — software reliability and scalability are mission-critical. UHG's engineering culture emphasizes stability, compliance, and measured delivery over move-fast-break-things. [Source: UnitedHealth Group 2025 10-K, Glassdoor Engineering Comp Data]

**Level Mapping:** UHG Software Engineer = Google L3 = Meta E3 = Optum T3-T4

**Global Levers**

1. **Scale of Impact Frame:** "UHG processes $300B+ in annual claims across 150M+ members. The systems I build aren't hobby projects — they're critical infrastructure for the largest healthcare company in America. My comp should reflect enterprise-scale impact, not startup-tier engineering."
2. **Optum Internal Benchmark:** "I know Optum — UHG's own subsidiary — pays 15-25% more for equivalent engineering roles. If UHG wants to retain engineering talent instead of losing them to internal transfers to Optum, the initial offer needs to be competitive with Optum bands."
3. **Bonus Percentage Push:** "UHG's bonus structure is a meaningful part of total comp. I'd like the bonus target at 15% rather than 10% — this aligns with what I've seen for engineers working on claims and member-facing systems where uptime directly impacts revenue."
4. **Healthcare Compliance Premium:** "I bring experience building HIPAA-compliant systems with PHI data handling. Healthcare software engineering isn't generic web dev — it requires understanding of compliance frameworks, audit trails, and regulatory requirements that general engineers lack."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $170K with RSUs at $100K/4yr and a 15% bonus target. My experience building [specific system] at [current company] directly maps to UHG's claims/member platform needs." UHG will counter at $140K-$160K base with $60K-$90K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $190K. The bonus percentage is the most flexible lever — push for 15% if offered 10%.
