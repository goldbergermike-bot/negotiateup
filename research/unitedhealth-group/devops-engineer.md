### DevOps Engineer | UnitedHealth Group Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Health Insurance Giant / Bonus-Heavy Comp / RSU Growing | HIPAA-Compliant Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Minnetonka MN | $130K–$180K | $45K–$130K/4yr | 10–15% | $160K–$260K |
| Dallas TX | $125K–$175K | $40K–$120K/4yr | 10–15% | $155K–$250K |
| Remote US | $120K–$170K | $35K–$115K/4yr | 10–15% | $145K–$240K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at UnitedHealth Group manage the CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and platform engineering that support one of the most complex healthcare technology ecosystems in the US. UHG runs a hybrid cloud environment spanning on-premises data centers, Azure, AWS, and GCP — with strict HIPAA/HITRUST compliance requirements for every deployment. DevOps at UHG is not just "deploy faster" — it's "deploy securely, auditably, and in compliance with federal healthcare regulations." Engineers build and maintain infrastructure-as-code, container orchestration (Kubernetes), secrets management, and automated compliance scanning for systems that handle PHI data for 150M+ members. The complexity of managing HIPAA-compliant CI/CD at this scale — with FedRAMP considerations for government contracts — makes healthcare DevOps a specialized and in-demand skill set.

**Level Mapping:** UHG DevOps Engineer = Google L3-L4 SRE = Optum T3-T4 Platform Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **HIPAA Compliance Premium:** "Healthcare DevOps isn't standard DevOps. Every pipeline, deployment, and infrastructure change must be HIPAA-compliant with full audit trails. I bring experience building compliant CI/CD in regulated environments — this eliminates the compliance learning curve that costs 6-12 months for general DevOps engineers."
2. **Hybrid Cloud Complexity:** "UHG's multi-cloud environment (Azure, AWS, GCP + on-prem) is orders of magnitude more complex than a single-cloud shop. I'm managing infrastructure across hybrid environments with PHI data residency requirements — that's a specialized skill set."
3. **Uptime = Member Access Frame:** "System downtime at UHG means members can't access claims, providers can't verify eligibility, and pharmacies can't process prescriptions. DevOps reliability at UHG is literally healthcare access reliability. My comp should reflect the operational criticality."
4. **Platform Engineering Evolution:** "DevOps is evolving into Platform Engineering at UHG — building internal developer platforms that accelerate all engineering teams. This strategic scope is larger than traditional DevOps and should be compensated accordingly."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $175K with RSUs at $110K/4yr and a 15% bonus target. My experience building HIPAA-compliant CI/CD pipelines and managing Kubernetes infrastructure in healthcare at [current company] directly transfers to UHG's platform needs." UHG will counter at $145K-$165K base with $60K-$90K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $200K. Push on base salary — healthcare DevOps compliance expertise is the strongest lever for base negotiation.
