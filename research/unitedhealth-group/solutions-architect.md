### Solutions Architect | UnitedHealth Group Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Health Insurance Giant / Bonus-Heavy Comp / RSU Growing | Enterprise Healthcare Architecture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Minnetonka MN | $145K–$200K | $60K–$160K/4yr | 12–18% | $190K–$295K |
| Dallas TX | $140K–$195K | $55K–$150K/4yr | 12–18% | $185K–$285K |
| Remote US | $135K–$185K | $50K–$140K/4yr | 12–18% | $175K–$270K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at UnitedHealth Group design end-to-end technical solutions spanning UHG's massive healthcare technology ecosystem. The role bridges business requirements and technical implementation — translating complex healthcare workflows (claims processing, member enrollment, provider network management, pharmacy benefits) into scalable system architectures. Solutions Architects at UHG work across internal platforms and external integrations, designing APIs, data flows, and system interfaces that connect UnitedHealthcare, Optum, and thousands of provider/payer partners. The role requires deep understanding of healthcare interoperability standards (HL7 FHIR, X12 EDI), enterprise integration patterns, cloud architecture, and the regulatory landscape. At UHG's scale ($530B, 150M+ members), architectural decisions have enormous downstream impact — a poorly designed integration can affect millions of claims and cost hundreds of millions in operational inefficiency.

**Level Mapping:** UHG Solutions Architect = Google L5 Solutions = AWS Senior SA = Optum T5 Architect

**Global Levers**

1. **Healthcare Interoperability Expertise:** "I bring deep knowledge of healthcare data standards — HL7 FHIR, X12 EDI, ICD-10, NCPDP — that general solutions architects don't have. Healthcare interoperability is a specialized domain, and my expertise eliminates the 12-month ramp of training a general architect on healthcare data flows."
2. **Architectural Decision Impact:** "At UHG's scale, a single architectural decision — API design, data model, integration pattern — affects millions of transactions and hundreds of millions in operational costs. My compensation should reflect the financial impact of the architectural decisions I'll make."
3. **CMS Interoperability Mandates:** "CMS is mandating FHIR-based interoperability, price transparency APIs, and prior authorization automation. These architectural requirements have hard regulatory deadlines. I'm not building nice-to-have features — I'm designing architectures for regulatory compliance."
4. **Multi-Business Unit Scope:** "Solutions Architects at UHG span UnitedHealthcare, Optum, and corporate platforms. This cross-organizational scope is equivalent to a principal-level role at a single-product company. The comp should reflect the breadth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $195K with RSUs at $140K/4yr and an 18% bonus target. My healthcare solutions architecture experience — specifically designing [FHIR APIs / claims platforms / interoperability solutions] at [current company] — means I can own UHG's architecture roadmap from day one." UHG will counter at $160K-$180K base with $80K-$120K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $240K. Push on the RSU grant — solutions architects at UHG have strong equity negotiation room.
