**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at UnitedHealth Group are the highest individual contributor technical leaders, responsible for cross-team architecture, platform strategy, and technical vision across UHG's sprawling technology organization. At UHG's scale ($530B market cap, 400K+ employees), Staff engineers drive decisions that affect multiple business units — UnitedHealthcare, Optum, and corporate platforms. The role requires deep technical expertise combined with organizational influence: setting coding standards, defining API contracts between teams, leading architecture review boards, and making build-vs-buy decisions on platforms that process healthcare data for 150M+ members. UHG has been building out its staff+ IC track to retain senior technical talent who don't want the management path, and comp at this level is approaching Optum parity.

**Level Mapping:** UHG Staff Engineer = Google L5-L6 = Meta E5-E6 = Optum T6-T7 = Microsoft Principal

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Org Architecture Frame:** "Staff engineers at UHG don't just write code for one team — they architect platforms that span UnitedHealthcare, Optum, and corporate technology. My compensation should reflect this cross-organizational scope and the strategic impact of the architectural decisions I'll make."
2. **IC-vs-Manager Parity:** "Engineering managers at equivalent scope earn $250K-$350K+ TC at UHG. The Staff IC track should offer parity — I'm providing the same strategic impact without the management overhead costs of an additional team. Push the RSU grant to close the gap."
3. **Platform Decision Economics:** "At the Staff level, I'll make build-vs-buy and architecture decisions worth millions in long-term TCO. A single platform choice — microservices vs. monolith, cloud provider selection, data architecture — has 10-100x the financial impact of my annual compensation."
4. **Retention Investment Frame:** "Staff engineers are the hardest roles to fill externally because they require both deep technical skill and organizational context. Losing a Staff engineer means 12-18 months of knowledge drain. The comp premium I'm asking for is insurance against that loss."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "At the Staff level, I'm providing cross-organizational technical leadership that directly shapes UHG's platform strategy. I'd like the base at $220K with RSUs at $200K/4yr and a 22% bonus target. My experience leading [specific platform/architecture initiative] at [current company] maps directly to UHG's modernization needs." UHG will counter at $185K-$205K base with $120K-$170K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $300K. The bonus target percentage is the most negotiable lever at Staff level — UHG can flex from 15% to 22% for proven technical leaders.
