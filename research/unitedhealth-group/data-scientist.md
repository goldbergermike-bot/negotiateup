### Data Scientist | UnitedHealth Group Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Health Insurance Giant / Bonus-Heavy Comp / RSU Growing | Actuarial-Adjacent Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Minnetonka MN | $135K–$185K | $50K–$140K/4yr | 12–18% | $170K–$275K |
| Dallas TX | $130K–$180K | $45K–$130K/4yr | 12–18% | $165K–$265K |
| Remote US | $125K–$175K | $40K–$125K/4yr | 12–18% | $155K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at UnitedHealth Group sit at the intersection of healthcare analytics, actuarial science, and machine learning. UHG's data science teams build predictive models for member risk stratification, claims cost forecasting, provider quality scoring, fraud/waste/abuse detection, and population health management. The role carries unusual organizational weight because UHG's core insurance business depends on accurately modeling healthcare costs — a 1% improvement in cost prediction accuracy across 150M+ members translates to billions in financial impact. Data scientists here must combine statistical rigor (survival analysis, GLMs, time-series forecasting) with healthcare domain knowledge (clinical risk factors, care episode grouping, pharmacy trends). UHG competes with health tech startups, consulting firms (McKinsey Health, BCG), and Optum's own analytics teams for this talent. [Source: UHG Chief Data & Analytics Officer presentations 2025]

**Level Mapping:** UHG Data Scientist = Google L3-L4 DS = Meta IC4 DS = Optum T4 DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Actuarial-Adjacent Framing:** "My predictive modeling work directly feeds the actuarial function — member risk scoring, cost forecasting, and reserve estimation. Actuaries at UHG earn $150K-$250K+. My data science work powers their models and should be compensated commensurately."
2. **Financial Impact Quantification:** "A 1% improvement in claims prediction accuracy across UHG's 150M+ member base has a multi-billion dollar financial impact. My modeling work isn't academic research — it directly affects UHG's medical loss ratio and profitability."
3. **Optum Analytics Counter:** "Optum's data science roles are benchmarked 15-20% higher than UHG parent. If my models feed Optum products (like Optum Rx analytics or OptumInsight), the compensation should reflect the Optum analytics benchmark."
4. **Healthcare DS Scarcity:** "Data scientists who understand clinical risk factors, pharmacy benefit structures, and healthcare cost drivers are scarce. Generalist data scientists take 12-18 months to become productive in healthcare — my domain expertise eliminates that ramp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $180K with RSUs at $120K/4yr and an 18% bonus target. My healthcare predictive modeling experience — specifically [risk stratification / cost forecasting / FWA detection] — means I'm productive from day one on UHG's highest-priority analytics initiatives." UHG will counter at $150K-$170K base with $70K-$100K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $220K. Push on the bonus target — healthcare data scientists with domain expertise can negotiate 18% vs the standard 12%.
