### Technical Program Manager | UnitedHealth Group Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Health Insurance Giant / Bonus-Heavy Comp / RSU Growing | Cross-Org Program Execution

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Minnetonka MN | $140K–$195K | $55K–$145K/4yr | 12–20% | $180K–$285K |
| Dallas TX | $135K–$190K | $50K–$135K/4yr | 12–20% | $175K–$275K |
| Remote US | $130K–$180K | $45K–$125K/4yr | 12–20% | $165K–$260K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at UnitedHealth Group drive the execution of complex, cross-functional technology programs spanning multiple engineering teams, business units, and external partners. At UHG's scale ($530B, 400K+ employees), TPMs navigate organizational complexity that dwarfs most tech companies — coordinating across UnitedHealthcare, Optum, Change Healthcare, and corporate technology while managing dependencies with providers, pharmacies, state regulators, and CMS. TPMs at UHG manage programs like platform migrations, regulatory compliance implementations (CMS mandates), M&A technology integrations, and enterprise-wide modernization initiatives. The role requires strong technical fluency, stakeholder management across a matrixed organization, and healthcare domain knowledge. UHG's TPM function has grown significantly as the company executes on its technology transformation strategy. [Source: UHG Technology Program Management Office 2025]

**Level Mapping:** UHG TPM = Google L4-L5 TPM = Meta IC4-IC5 TPM = Optum T4-T5 TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Organizational Complexity Premium:** "UHG's organizational structure — UnitedHealthcare, Optum, Change Healthcare, corporate tech — creates program management complexity that rivals the US federal government. TPMs who can navigate this matrixed environment effectively are rare and valuable."
2. **Regulatory Deadline Leverage:** "CMS compliance programs have hard regulatory deadlines with financial penalties for non-compliance. I'm not managing optional feature work — I'm driving programs where delays have direct regulatory and financial consequences."
3. **M&A Integration Experience:** "UHG has made significant acquisitions (Change Healthcare, Amedisys, etc.). TPMs who can manage technology integration programs for billion-dollar acquisitions command a premium because the stakes of poor integration execution are enormous."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "TPMs at UHG have bonus targets of 12-20%. Given the cross-organizational scope and regulatory urgency of the programs I'll manage, I'm targeting 20% — the top of the TPM bonus band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $190K with RSUs at $125K/4yr and a 20% bonus target. My experience managing cross-functional technology programs at [current company] — including [specific program with regulatory/compliance components] — directly maps to UHG's most complex program needs." UHG will counter at $155K-$175K base with $70K-$100K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $230K. Push hardest on the bonus target — TPMs at UHG can negotiate from 12% to 20%.
