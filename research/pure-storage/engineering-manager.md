### Engineering Manager | Pure Storage Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Enterprise Flash Storage | 300TB DirectFlash Module | Purity Turbo | +10% Management Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

| Santa Clara | $185K–$230K | $150K–$280K | 15–20% | $312K–$365K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Pure Storage lead the teams building the DirectFlash platform and Purity software stack — the technology that delivers 20x efficiency over legacy storage competitors. You are responsible for team velocity, technical direction, and talent retention on the most critical storage platform in the industry. Pure Storage's ability to ship 300TB DirectFlash Modules and Purity Turbo software depends on engineering managers who can hire, retain, and accelerate world-class storage engineers in a fiercely competitive talent market. Your compensation should reflect both your management leverage and the strategic importance of the platform your team builds.

**Level Mapping:**

| Pure Storage | Google | Meta | Amazon | Microsoft |

| M1 (EM) | L6 Manager | M1 | SDM | 67 Manager |
| M2 (Sr. EM) | L7 Manager | M2 | Sr. SDM | 68 Manager |

**300TB DirectFlash — The 20x Efficiency Premium**

Pure Storage's DirectFlash Module (DFM) delivers 300TB in a single module with Purity Turbo software, achieving a 20x efficiency gain over legacy storage competitors (Dell EMC, NetApp, HPE). As an Engineering Manager, you are the force multiplier behind this advantage — you hire the engineers, set the execution cadence, and remove the blockers that determine whether 300TB DirectFlash ships on time and at quality. Pure Storage delivers 20x the efficiency of legacy competitors — this isn't incremental improvement, it's a generation leap. Engineers who build the platform that makes legacy storage obsolete deserve premium comp — and the managers who lead those engineers deserve compensation that reflects their multiplicative impact. Use this to justify above-market base salaries: "My team's output directly determines whether Pure Storage maintains its 20x efficiency lead. That management leverage commands premium comp."

**Global Levers**

1. **Team Output Leverage:** "I manage the team shipping the DirectFlash platform. My leadership directly impacts whether Pure Storage maintains its 20x efficiency advantage over Dell EMC and NetApp. That leverage is worth top-of-band equity."
2. **Talent Retention Value:** "Retaining top storage engineers is existential for Pure Storage. I bring a track record of <5% attrition on my teams. That retention capability is worth a premium in comp."
3. **Hiring Market Competition:** "Google, Amazon, and Meta are all hiring engineering managers for storage teams. My comp needs to reflect competing offers in the $340K–$380K range."
4. **Scope Expansion:** "I want to discuss a growth trajectory from EM to Senior EM within 18 months, with equity refreshes that reflect expanded scope as DirectFlash scales."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about leading the team behind the 300TB DirectFlash platform — 20x efficiency over legacy storage is the most compelling engineering challenge in the industry. I have a competing offer at $350K total comp from [Competitor]. To join Pure Storage, I need $360K total comp: $220K base, $260K RSUs over four years, a 20% target bonus, and a $35K signing bonus. My accept-at floor is $330K total comp. I'm ready to start building this team."
