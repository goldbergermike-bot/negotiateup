### Data Engineer | Pure Storage Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Enterprise Flash Storage | 300TB DirectFlash Module | Purity Turbo | Market-Rate

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $140K–$172K | $80K–$148K | 10–15% | $215K–$248K |
| Denver | $128K–$158K | $70K–$132K | 10–15% | $198K–$228K |
| Remote US | $120K–$148K | $62K–$118K | 10–15% | $178K–$208K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Pure Storage build the data infrastructure that powers Pure1 analytics, internal business intelligence, and the telemetry pipelines that ingest performance data from every DirectFlash array deployed worldwide. You design and maintain the data architectures — streaming pipelines, data lakes, ETL workflows — that transform raw storage telemetry into actionable insights for product engineering, customer success, and sales teams. With 300TB DirectFlash Modules generating massive volumes of operational data, Pure Storage's data engineering challenges rival those at hyperscalers. Your work directly impacts product quality, customer retention, and revenue forecasting. (Sources: Pure Storage 2024 10-K; levels.fyi Data Engineer data; Glassdoor; Indeed salary data.)

**300TB DirectFlash — The 20x Efficiency Premium**

Pure Storage's DirectFlash Module (DFM) delivers 300TB in a single module with Purity Turbo software, achieving a 20x efficiency gain over legacy storage competitors (Dell EMC, NetApp, HPE). As a Data Engineer, you build the pipelines that process telemetry from these 300TB modules at scale — ingesting, transforming, and serving data that drives product decisions and customer outcomes. The 20x efficiency advantage generates 20x the telemetry density, creating data engineering challenges that legacy storage vendors never face. Pure Storage delivers 20x the efficiency of legacy competitors — this isn't incremental improvement, it's a generation leap. Engineers who build the platform that makes legacy storage obsolete deserve premium comp — and the data engineers who build the intelligence layer on top of that platform are essential to turning data into competitive advantage. Use pipeline scale, data volume growth, and business impact as justification for above-market base salary and equity.

**Global Levers**

1. **Pipeline Scale:** "I'll build data pipelines processing telemetry from every 300TB DirectFlash array globally — that's petabytes of operational data flowing through the systems I design. That scale commands premium data engineering comp."
2. **Business Intelligence Impact:** "My data infrastructure powers revenue forecasting, customer health scoring, and product analytics. Those pipelines directly enable better business decisions — I want equity reflecting that value."
3. **Data Architecture Investment:** "I'll design data architectures that scale with Pure Storage's growth — from hundreds to thousands of DirectFlash deployments. That foundational work pays dividends for years and deserves front-loaded equity."
4. **Competing Offers:** "I have data engineering offers from [Snowflake/Databricks/Google] at $240K total comp. Pure Storage's data challenges are compelling, but my comp needs to be competitive with data-platform companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm drawn to Pure Storage's data engineering challenge — building pipelines that process telemetry from 300TB DirectFlash arrays at global scale is exactly the kind of problem I want to solve. I have a competing offer at $242K total comp from [Competitor]. To join Pure Storage, I need $245K total comp: $165K base, $140K RSUs over four years, a 15% target bonus, and a $18K signing bonus. My accept-at floor is $228K total comp. I'll build the data infrastructure that scales with DirectFlash growth."
