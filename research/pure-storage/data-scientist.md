### Data Scientist | Pure Storage Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Enterprise Flash Storage | 300TB DirectFlash Module | Purity Turbo | +5% Analytics Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $148K–$180K | $90K–$170K | 10–15% | $228K–$262K |
| Denver | $135K–$165K | $78K–$150K | 10–15% | $208K–$242K |
| Remote US | $128K–$155K | $70K–$135K | 10–15% | $188K–$222K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Pure Storage work on Pure1 Meta — the cloud-based analytics platform that ingests telemetry from every DirectFlash array deployed globally. This data drives predictive support, capacity planning, and the AI-powered recommendations that make Pure Storage's customer experience far superior to legacy competitors. With 300TB DirectFlash Modules generating unprecedented volumes of storage telemetry, data scientists at Pure Storage have access to one of the richest enterprise infrastructure datasets in the industry. Your models directly impact customer retention, support efficiency, and product roadmap decisions.

**300TB DirectFlash — The 20x Efficiency Premium**

Pure Storage's DirectFlash Module (DFM) delivers 300TB in a single module with Purity Turbo software, achieving a 20x efficiency gain over legacy storage competitors (Dell EMC, NetApp, HPE). As a Data Scientist, you analyze the telemetry that these 300TB modules generate — performance metrics, failure patterns, capacity utilization, and workload characteristics at a scale no legacy vendor can match. Pure Storage delivers 20x the efficiency of legacy competitors — this isn't incremental improvement, it's a generation leap. Engineers who build the platform that makes legacy storage obsolete deserve premium comp — and the data scientists who mine telemetry to improve reliability, predict failures, and optimize performance are critical to sustaining that 20x advantage. Your predictive models reduce support costs by millions annually and drive product improvements that widen the gap against legacy storage. Use this to justify above-market equity and base salary.

**Global Levers**

1. **Telemetry Scale:** "Pure1 Meta ingests telemetry from every DirectFlash deployment globally — that's one of the richest enterprise infrastructure datasets in the industry. My analytical skills unlock revenue and retention value from that data."
2. **Predictive Support Impact:** "My models will predict failures before they happen, reducing support costs and increasing customer NPS. That's quantifiable business value — I can point to $X in support cost reduction at my previous role."
3. **Competing Offers:** "I have data science offers from [Google/Amazon/Meta] in the $250K range. Pure Storage's data is more compelling, but my comp needs to be competitive with hyperscaler offers."
4. **Pure1 Revenue Enablement:** "Pure1 analytics drive upsell and renewal decisions. My work directly enables Pure Storage's subscription revenue growth — I want equity that reflects that revenue impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to work on Pure1 Meta — analyzing telemetry from 300TB DirectFlash arrays at global scale is a unique data science opportunity. I have a competing offer at $248K total comp from [Hyperscaler]. To join Pure Storage, I need $258K total comp: $172K base, $155K RSUs over four years, a 15% target bonus, and a $20K signing bonus. My accept-at floor is $240K total comp. The data opportunity at Pure Storage is more compelling — let's align on comp."
