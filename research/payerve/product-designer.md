**Negotiation DNA**

As a Product Designer at Payerve, you shape how merchants, consumers, and financial institutions interact with the payment facilitation platform across the MENA corridor. Payerve's Dubai Intelligent Automation focus demands designers who can create intuitive interfaces for complex payment workflows — transforming multi-step onboarding, settlement management, and compliance processes into seamless experiences. Your design decisions directly affect merchant adoption rates and transaction volumes, making you a critical contributor to Regional Scale.

Product design at a private growth-stage MENA fintech carries unique demands. You must design for Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR) simultaneously, accommodate cultural preferences in the Arab world around trust signals and financial UX, and create design systems that scale across jurisdictions with different regulatory disclosure requirements. Dubai's tax-free salary environment means your AED 330,000-480,000 base delivers significantly more purchasing power than comparable design salaries in London or Amsterdam, while the option grant provides exposure to Payerve's growth trajectory in MENA digital payments.

The role requires bridging traditional and digital payments in the Arab world at the experience layer — designing checkout flows that feel native to Gulf consumers accustomed to both card payments and emerging digital wallets, creating merchant dashboards that present complex settlement and compliance data clearly, and building trust-first onboarding experiences for a market where payment digitization is still building consumer confidence. Designers who bring bilingual (Arabic/English) design expertise and fintech UX portfolios hold strong negotiation leverage.

### MENA Facilitator — The Regional Scale Premium

**Lever 1 — Dubai Intelligent Automation UX:** "Designing user experiences for Payerve's Dubai Intelligent Automation platform means creating interfaces that make complex payment automation accessible to merchants with varying technical sophistication. I bring experience designing for automated financial workflows — from payment orchestration dashboards to intelligent rule configuration interfaces. I'm targeting AED 460,000 base to reflect the specialized intersection of automation UX and payment facilitation design."

**Lever 2 — Bilingual RTL/LTR Design Systems for Regional Scale:** "Payerve's Regional Scale ambitions across the MENA corridor require a design system that works flawlessly in both Arabic RTL and English LTR, adapts to cultural preferences across UAE, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf markets, and maintains brand consistency across jurisdictions. Building this bilingual design system from the ground up is a foundational contribution — I'd like to discuss 0.10% in options (Options/4yr) to reflect the platform-level impact of this work."

**Lever 3 — Payment Facilitation Trust Design:** "Designing payment facilitation experiences in the Arab world requires deep understanding of trust signals, security perception, and compliance transparency that Gulf merchants and consumers expect. My portfolio includes fintech trust-building design patterns — I'd like the bonus target set at 15% of base to reflect the direct connection between design quality and merchant conversion rates across MENA markets."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Jurisdiction Compliance UX:** "Every MENA jurisdiction has different regulatory disclosure requirements for payment facilitators — from UAE's CBUAE mandates to Saudi Arabia's SAMA requirements. Designing compliant UX that doesn't sacrifice usability across multiple GCC regulators is a specialized skill. I'd like to negotiate a signing bonus of AED 30,000 to reflect the immediate value of my compliance-aware design capabilities for Payerve's Regional Scale expansion."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at AED 465,000 base ($127,000) using the MENA Facilitator framing — position bilingual RTL/LTR payment design expertise as a rare skill that commands a premium in the Dubai market. Open at AED 500,000 and accept at AED 400,000 floor. Push for 0.08-0.12% options (Options/4yr vesting), framing equity as "design system foundation for Regional Scale." Negotiate bonus to 14-16% of base. Total target package: AED 650,000-730,000 ($177,000-$199,000). Leverage the scarcity of Arabic-fluent fintech designers who can work across the full UX stack — this is a genuinely thin talent pool in Dubai.
