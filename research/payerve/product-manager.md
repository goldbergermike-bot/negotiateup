**Negotiation DNA**

As a Product Manager at Payerve, you define what the payment facilitation platform builds, how it serves merchants and consumers across the MENA corridor, and which markets to enter next. Payerve's Dubai Intelligent Automation focus demands PMs who understand the intersection of automation technology, payment regulatory requirements, and merchant needs in the Arab world. You translate Regional Scale ambitions into concrete product roadmaps that prioritize features for maximum market impact across UAE, Saudi Arabia, and emerging MENA economies.

Product management at a private growth-stage fintech in the Gulf combines the strategic influence of a PM role with the outsized impact of an early-stage company. Your product decisions directly shape Payerve's revenue trajectory and competitive position in MENA digital payments. The option grant (typically 0.10-0.18% at this stage) provides meaningful equity exposure, and Dubai's tax-free salary means your compensation goes further than comparable PM roles in taxed jurisdictions. PMs who bring payment industry domain expertise and Arabic-language market understanding carry exceptional leverage.

The role requires bridging traditional and digital payments in the Arab world at the product strategy level — understanding how merchants in Dubai, Riyadh, and Cairo think about payment acceptance, what compliance features are table-stakes versus differentiators, and how Payerve's platform can capture the shift from cash to digital across GCC economies. Regional Scale means your product roadmap must balance depth in core markets with expansion capability into new MENA jurisdictions.

### MENA Facilitator — The Regional Scale Premium

**Lever 1 — Dubai Intelligent Automation Product Vision:** "Defining the product vision for Payerve's Dubai Intelligent Automation capabilities means I'm deciding which payment workflows to automate, how to sequence automation features for maximum merchant value, and how to build a platform that enables self-serve payment facilitation. My background in payment product management positions me to make these high-leverage decisions from day one — I'm targeting AED 590,000 base to reflect this strategic ownership."

**Lever 2 — MENA Corridor Market Expansion Strategy:** "Payerve's Regional Scale product strategy across the MENA corridor requires a PM who understands the regulatory, cultural, and competitive landscape of each target market — from UAE's mature digital payment ecosystem to Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030-driven fintech acceleration to Egypt's massive unbanked population. I'd like 0.15% in options (Options/4yr) to reflect that my market prioritization decisions directly determine Payerve's revenue growth trajectory."

**Lever 3 — Payment Facilitation Product-Market Fit:** "Getting payment facilitation product-market fit right in the Gulf requires understanding both merchant needs and regulatory constraints across UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. I bring direct experience in building payment acceptance products for MENA merchants and can accelerate Payerve's path to product-market fit. I'd like the bonus target set at 20% of base with clear PMF metrics as triggers to align my incentives with Payerve's growth milestones."

**Lever 4 — Arabic-Language Market Intelligence:** "Payerve's mission of bridging traditional and digital payments in the Arab world requires a PM who understands Arabic-speaking merchant and consumer behavior at a deep level. My ability to conduct user research, analyze competitive dynamics, and define product requirements within the cultural context of the Arab world is a distinct Regional Scale advantage. I'd like to negotiate a signing bonus of AED 45,000 to reflect the immediate value of this market intelligence."
