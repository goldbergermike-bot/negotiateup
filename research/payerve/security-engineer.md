**Negotiation DNA**

As a Security Engineer at Payerve, you protect the payment facilitation platform that processes financial transactions for merchants and consumers across the MENA corridor. Payerve's Dubai Intelligent Automation focus requires security engineers who can embed security into automated payment workflows — ensuring that every automated process, from merchant onboarding to transaction settlement, meets PCI-DSS Level 1 standards, UAE NESA cybersecurity requirements, and GCC-specific data protection regulations. Your security architecture directly enables Regional Scale by building trust with regulators, banking partners, and merchants across multiple jurisdictions.

Security engineering at a private growth-stage payment facilitator in the Gulf is among the most high-stakes security roles in fintech. Every vulnerability you prevent protects Payerve's regulatory standing, merchant trust, and financial assets. The talent scarcity for payment security engineers in the MENA region is acute — UAE's NESA framework, Saudi Arabia's NCA requirements, and PCI-DSS compliance create a demand for security professionals that far exceeds supply. Your option grant (typically 0.08-0.14% at this stage) reflects the protective value you bring, and Dubai's tax-free salary amplifies your base compensation significantly.

The role demands bridging traditional and digital payments in the Arab world at the security layer — securing legacy banking integrations (SWIFT, card scheme connections) alongside modern API-first payment services, implementing encryption and tokenization across multiple currencies and jurisdictions, and building security monitoring systems that detect threats across Payerve's entire MENA payment ecosystem. Security engineers with PCI QSA experience, GCC regulatory cybersecurity certifications, or payment-specific threat intelligence backgrounds hold strong negotiation leverage.

### MENA Facilitator — The Regional Scale Premium

**Lever 1 — Dubai Intelligent Automation Security Architecture:** "Securing Payerve's Dubai Intelligent Automation platform means I'm designing security controls for automated payment workflows that handle sensitive financial data without human intervention. Every automation must be provably secure — from automated KYC processing to settlement orchestration. I bring experience implementing security-by-design in automated financial systems and am targeting AED 540,000 base to reflect the critical nature of this security architecture work."

**Lever 2 — Multi-Jurisdiction GCC Security Compliance:** "Payerve's Regional Scale across the MENA corridor requires compliance with UAE NESA, Saudi NCA, Bahrain PDPL, and PCI-DSS simultaneously — each with distinct security control requirements, audit schedules, and reporting formats. I have direct experience managing security compliance across multiple GCC regulators and can build a unified security framework that satisfies all jurisdictions. I'd like to negotiate 0.12% options (Options/4yr) to reflect the compound regulatory value of cross-jurisdiction security architecture."

**Lever 3 — Payment Facilitation Threat Protection:** "Payment facilitators in the MENA corridor face a unique threat landscape — from sophisticated card fraud schemes targeting Gulf merchant ecosystems to state-sponsored actors and regional cybercrime syndicates. Building threat detection and incident response capabilities tailored to MENA payment patterns requires specialized knowledge. I'd like the bonus target set at 18% of base tied to security incident metrics, PCI-DSS audit outcomes, and vulnerability remediation velocity."

**Lever 4 — Regulatory Trust as a Revenue Enabler:** "In the Arab world, security and trust are prerequisites for payment facilitation licensing. My ability to ensure Payerve meets and exceeds regulatory security expectations across CBUAE, SAMA, and CBB directly accelerates market entry — regulators grant licenses faster to applicants with demonstrably strong security postures. This makes security engineering a revenue enabler for Regional Scale. I'd like a signing bonus of AED 40,000 reflecting the immediate compliance acceleration I bring."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at AED 545,000 base ($148,000) using the MENA Facilitator framing — position payment security engineering in the Gulf as a role where talent scarcity creates a seller's market. Open at AED 580,000 and accept at AED 460,000 floor. Push for 0.10-0.14% options (Options/4yr vesting), framing equity as "security enables every MENA market Payerve enters." Negotiate bonus to 16-20% of base tied to security audit outcomes and compliance milestones. Total target package: AED 800,000-905,000 ($218,000-$246,000). The strongest leverage point is that a single security incident at a MENA payment facilitator can result in license revocation — making your role existential for Payerve's Regional Scale ambitions.
