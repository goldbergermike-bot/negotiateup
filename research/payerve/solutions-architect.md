**Negotiation DNA**

As a Solutions Architect at Payerve, you design the technical integration blueprint that connects the payment facilitation platform to merchants, banks, card networks, and digital wallets across the MENA corridor. Payerve's Dubai Intelligent Automation focus requires solutions architects who can design end-to-end payment flows — from merchant onboarding through transaction processing to settlement — while accounting for the regulatory, technical, and operational requirements of each GCC jurisdiction. Your architecture decisions define how Payerve achieves Regional Scale, directly determining the platform's ability to expand into new markets with minimal custom development.

Solutions architecture at a private growth-stage MENA fintech sits at the intersection of technical design, commercial strategy, and regulatory compliance. You work directly with enterprise merchants, banking partners, and regulators — translating their requirements into platform capabilities. Your option grant (typically 0.10-0.18% at this stage) reflects the high-leverage nature of the role: every integration pattern you design is reused across markets, compounding value as Payerve's MENA footprint grows. Dubai's tax-free salary means your AED 480,000-660,000 base delivers more net income than comparable roles in Europe.

The role demands bridging traditional and digital payments in the Arab world at the system integration level — designing architectures that connect Payerve's modern APIs with legacy banking systems, card scheme protocols, and government payment infrastructure across UAE, Saudi Arabia, and beyond. Solutions architects who bring deep payment protocol knowledge (ISO 20022, ISO 8583, SWIFT), Arabic-language client communication skills, and GCC banking relationship experience command premium compensation.

### MENA Facilitator — The Regional Scale Premium

**Lever 1 — Dubai Intelligent Automation Architecture:** "Designing the architecture for Payerve's Dubai Intelligent Automation platform requires understanding how payment orchestration, settlement automation, and compliance workflows interconnect as a system. I bring experience architecting end-to-end automated payment solutions and can define the platform architecture that enables self-serve merchant onboarding at scale. I'm targeting AED 630,000 base to reflect this system-level architectural ownership."

**Lever 2 — MENA Corridor Integration Blueprint:** "Payerve's Regional Scale across the MENA corridor requires an integration architecture that adapts to each market's banking infrastructure — from UAE's IPP instant payment system to Saudi Arabia's SARIE and mada networks to Egypt's Meeza scheme. I'll be designing the reusable integration patterns that allow Payerve to connect to new national payment systems in weeks rather than months. I'd like to negotiate 0.15% options (Options/4yr) to reflect the compound value of reusable cross-market architecture."

**Lever 3 — GCC Banking and Regulatory Integration:** "Architecting payment facilitation solutions that satisfy UAE CBUAE, Saudi SAMA, and Bahrain CBB requirements simultaneously requires deep knowledge of GCC banking protocols and regulatory reporting systems. My experience integrating with Gulf banking infrastructure means Payerve can achieve compliance faster in each new market. I'd like the bonus target set at 20% of base tied to merchant integration velocity and new market technical readiness milestones."

**Lever 4 — Legacy-to-Modern Payment Bridge Design:** "Payerve's mission of bridging traditional and digital payments in the Arab world is fundamentally an architecture challenge. I can design systems that translate between ISO 8583 card messages and modern REST APIs, between SWIFT batch settlements and real-time notifications, and between legacy bank core systems and cloud-native microservices. This bridge architecture is the key enabler for Regional Scale. I'd like a signing bonus of AED 50,000 reflecting the immediate architectural leadership I bring."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at AED 640,000 base ($174,000) using the MENA Facilitator framing — position yourself as the architect who designs the reusable integration patterns that determine whether Payerve can scale across MENA markets efficiently. Open at AED 680,000 and accept at AED 530,000 floor. Push for 0.12-0.18% options (Options/4yr vesting), framing equity as "architectural leverage for Regional Scale." Negotiate bonus to 18-22% of base tied to integration delivery and platform expansion milestones. Total target package: AED 980,000-1,100,000 ($267,000-$300,000). Use the scarcity of solutions architects with both payment protocol and GCC banking integration experience as your primary leverage point.
