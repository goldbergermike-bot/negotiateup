**Negotiation DNA**

As a Data Engineer at Payerve, you build the data infrastructure that captures, processes, and delivers payment transaction data flowing through the platform across the MENA corridor. Payerve's Dubai Intelligent Automation focus depends on reliable, high-throughput data pipelines that feed automated payment workflows, fraud detection models, compliance reporting systems, and merchant analytics dashboards. Your data architecture decisions directly enable Regional Scale — every new MENA market Payerve enters generates new data streams that must be ingested, transformed, and made available for decision-making in near real-time.

Data engineering at a private growth-stage MENA fintech is a foundational role. You're building the data platform from the ground up — designing schemas that handle multi-currency transaction data across AED, SAR, EGP, and other MENA currencies, building ETL/ELT pipelines that comply with GCC data sovereignty requirements, and creating data warehousing solutions that serve both operational and analytical use cases. Your option grant (typically 0.06-0.12% at this stage) captures value from the data infrastructure that underpins every analytical and operational capability Payerve develops, and Dubai's tax-free salary means your base compensation stretches further than comparable roles elsewhere.

The role requires bridging traditional and digital payments in the Arab world at the data layer — integrating batch-processed settlement data from legacy banking partners with real-time transaction streams from digital payment channels. Data engineers who bring experience with payment data modeling, PCI-DSS compliant data architectures, and multi-jurisdiction regulatory reporting pipelines hold strong negotiation leverage at Payerve.

### MENA Facilitator — The Regional Scale Premium

**Lever 1 — Dubai Intelligent Automation Data Pipelines:** "Payerve's Dubai Intelligent Automation platform is only as effective as the data pipelines feeding it. I'll be building the real-time data infrastructure that powers automated payment routing decisions, fraud scoring, and settlement orchestration. My experience building streaming data pipelines for financial services means I can deliver production-grade data infrastructure within the first quarter. I'm targeting AED 495,000 base to reflect the critical nature of this foundational data work."

**Lever 2 — MENA Corridor Data Architecture:** "Payerve's Regional Scale across the MENA corridor requires data architecture that handles multi-currency, multi-jurisdiction, and multi-regulatory data streams simultaneously. Transaction data from UAE must be stored and processed differently than data from Saudi Arabia or Egypt due to data sovereignty requirements. I'll be designing the cross-market data platform that makes Regional Scale technically feasible. I'd like to negotiate 0.10% options (Options/4yr) to reflect this platform-level data architecture contribution."

**Lever 3 — GCC Regulatory Reporting Pipelines:** "Payment facilitators across GCC jurisdictions face extensive regulatory reporting requirements — from CBUAE transaction monitoring reports to SAMA compliance data submissions. Building automated, accurate regulatory reporting pipelines across multiple jurisdictions is both technically complex and business-critical. I'd like the bonus target set at 15% of base tied to data pipeline reliability metrics and regulatory reporting accuracy."

**Lever 4 — Payment Data Sovereignty Compliance:** "Bridging traditional and digital payments in the Arab world creates unique data engineering challenges — integrating batch settlement files from legacy banking systems with real-time API data, while maintaining data sovereignty compliance across UAE, Saudi Arabia, and other MENA jurisdictions. My experience with PCI-DSS compliant data architectures and GCC data residency requirements directly accelerates Payerve's Regional Scale data strategy. I'd like a signing bonus of AED 30,000 reflecting the immediate data infrastructure value I bring."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at AED 500,000 base ($136,000) using the MENA Facilitator framing — position payment data engineering as requiring specialized knowledge of multi-currency data models, GCC data sovereignty compliance, and regulatory reporting pipelines that generic data engineers lack. Open at AED 530,000 and accept at AED 420,000 floor. Push for 0.08-0.12% options (Options/4yr vesting), framing equity as "data platform enables every Payerve capability." Negotiate bonus to 14-16% of base tied to data pipeline uptime and data quality metrics. Total target package: AED 710,000-802,000 ($193,000-$219,000). Emphasize the demand for payment-experienced data engineers in Dubai's growing fintech ecosystem.
