**Negotiation DNA**

As an Engineering Manager at Payerve, you lead the teams building the payment facilitation platform that connects merchants and consumers across the MENA corridor. Payerve's Dubai Intelligent Automation focus requires engineering managers who can balance velocity with reliability — shipping new payment capabilities quickly while maintaining the uptime and compliance standards demanded by UAE Central Bank, SAMA, and GCC regulators. You are responsible for hiring, developing, and retaining engineering talent in one of the world's most competitive fintech labor markets, directly enabling Payerve's Regional Scale ambitions.

Engineering management at a private growth-stage fintech in Dubai carries a distinct compensation profile. Your base salary benefits from the UAE's zero-income-tax environment, and your option grant (typically 0.12-0.20% for EM roles at this stage) provides exposure to Payerve's growth trajectory across MENA digital payments — a market undergoing rapid transformation as the Arab world bridges traditional and digital payment systems. The bonus component is typically tied to team delivery milestones, hiring targets, and platform reliability metrics.

The role demands cross-cultural leadership across distributed teams spanning Dubai, Riyadh, and remote MENA locations. EMs who bring experience managing teams in regulated fintech environments, familiarity with Arabic-speaking engineering cultures, and a track record of building payment infrastructure teams hold exceptional negotiation leverage. Payerve's Regional Scale strategy means your team will grow significantly — negotiating for a headcount commitment alongside your compensation package is a savvy move that signals strategic alignment.

### MENA Facilitator — The Regional Scale Premium

**Lever 1 — Dubai Intelligent Automation Team Leadership:** "Leading engineering teams building Dubai Intelligent Automation systems for payment facilitation requires a specific management profile — I need to balance aggressive feature velocity with regulatory compliance, manage distributed teams across UAE and Saudi Arabia, and make hiring decisions in a talent market where experienced payment engineers command premium compensation. I'm targeting AED 650,000 base to reflect this multi-dimensional leadership scope."

**Lever 2 — Regional Scale Hiring and Talent Strategy:** "Payerve's Regional Scale ambitions across the MENA corridor depend directly on my ability to attract, hire, and retain top engineering talent in Dubai and Riyadh. The competition for fintech engineers in the Gulf is fierce — Checkout.com, Tabby, Tamara, and Lean Technologies are all scaling aggressively. I'd like to negotiate 0.18% options (Options/4yr) to align my equity stake with the team-building outcomes that determine Payerve's expansion capacity."

**Lever 3 — GCC Compliance Delivery Assurance:** "Managing engineering delivery of payment facilitation features across multiple GCC jurisdictions means I'm accountable for compliance timelines that directly affect Payerve's licensing and revenue. A missed regulatory deadline in UAE or Saudi Arabia doesn't just delay a feature — it delays market entry. I'd like the bonus structure set at 20% of base with clear compliance delivery triggers to reflect this accountability."

**Lever 4 — Bridging Traditional and Digital Payment Cultures:** "Payerve's mission of bridging traditional and digital payments in the Arab world extends to how we build teams. I bring experience leading engineering organizations that integrate fintech talent with traditional banking expertise — the exact cultural bridge Payerve needs for Regional Scale. I'd like to discuss a signing bonus of AED 55,000 and a commitment to annual equity refreshes to ensure long-term retention alignment with Payerve's MENA growth trajectory."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at AED 660,000 base ($180,000) using the MENA Facilitator framing — position yourself as the person who builds the engineering organization that enables Regional Scale. Open at AED 700,000 and accept at AED 560,000 floor. On equity, push for 0.15-0.20% options (Options/4yr vesting), framing it as "team-building creates platform value." Negotiate bonus to 18-22% of base tied to hiring targets and platform delivery milestones. Total target package: AED 1,050,000-1,170,000 ($286,000-$319,000). Leverage the scarcity of payment-experienced engineering managers in Dubai and the high cost of a bad EM hire (6-12 months of lost team productivity) as negotiation anchors.
