**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at C3.ai own the product roadmap for enterprise AI applications and the C3 AI Suite platform. Tom Siebel's enterprise software background means PM is a well-understood function — PMs own customer outcomes and product-market fit for each vertical AI application. The PM org is small and high-impact: each PM owns a significant product domain (platform, generative AI, vertical applications, or partner integrations). C3.ai PMs must balance technical depth (understanding AI/ML capabilities) with enterprise customer empathy. [Source: C3.ai PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** C3.ai PM = Palantir PM = Google L5 PM = Salesforce PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Revenue Ownership:** "C3.ai PMs own product-market fit for enterprise AI applications. My product decisions directly drive customer deployment success and renewal revenue."
2. **Generative AI Product Strategy:** If owning C3 Generative AI, push for AI premium: "I'm defining the enterprise generative AI product strategy competing against Microsoft Copilot, Google Vertex AI, and AWS Bedrock."
3. **Vertical AI Expertise:** If owning a vertical application (energy, defense, manufacturing), push for domain premium: "My domain expertise in [vertical] is essential to product-market fit — it can't be hired off the street."
4. **Palantir/Salesforce PM Counter:** Both offer competitive PM comp with more stable equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $170K over 4 years. I'm defining the product strategy for C3.ai's enterprise AI platform, and I have PM offers from Palantir and Salesforce with more stable equity." Counter at $140K-$160K RSUs is competitive.
