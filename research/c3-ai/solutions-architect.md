### Solutions Architect | C3.ai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($4B Market Cap) | Enterprise AI Platform | Tom Siebel-Led | Customer-Facing

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City HQ | $150K–$205K | $50K–$160K | 10% | $180K–$290K |
| Remote US | $135K–$190K | $40K–$140K | 10% | $165K–$265K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at C3.ai design and deploy enterprise AI solutions for Fortune 500 and government customers. C3.ai SAs are highly customer-facing — they architect AI application deployments across energy grids, manufacturing plants, financial institutions, and defense systems. This role is closer to Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineer model than a typical SA role. The vertical domain expertise required (understanding industrial IoT data, financial fraud patterns, or defense intelligence workflows) is rare and commands premium compensation.

**Level Mapping:** C3.ai Senior SA = Palantir Forward Deployed Eng = Databricks SA = AWS Senior SA

**Global Levers**

1. **Forward-Deployed Engineering Model:** "C3.ai SAs deploy enterprise AI at customer sites. This is closer to Palantir's forward-deployed model than a typical pre-sales SA role. The comp should reflect the deployment engineering intensity."
2. **Vertical Domain Expertise:** "My domain expertise in [energy/defense/finance/manufacturing] is essential for successful AI deployments. Domain SAs can't be hired off the street — this specialization has premium market value."
3. **Government Deployment Premium:** If deploying AI for government customers, push for clearance premium and travel compensation.
4. **Palantir FDE Counter:** Palantir forward-deployed engineers earn premium comp. Use as direct comparable.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $150K over 4 years. C3.ai SAs function as forward-deployed AI engineers, not just pre-sales support. My domain expertise in [vertical] is directly revenue-generating." Counter at $120K-$145K RSUs is acceptable.
