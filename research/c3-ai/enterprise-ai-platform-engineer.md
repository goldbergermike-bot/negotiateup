### Enterprise AI Platform Engineer | C3.ai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($4B Market Cap) | Enterprise AI Platform | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | Tom Siebel-Led

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City HQ | $155K–$215K | $65K–$180K | 10% | $190K–$310K |
| Remote US | $140K–$200K | $55K–$160K | 10% | $175K–$285K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is C3.ai's signature engineering role. Enterprise AI Platform Engineers build the core C3 AI Suite — an enterprise AI/ML development platform used by defense, energy, manufacturing, and financial services organizations. C3.ai is public (NYSE: AI, ~$4B market cap) and led by Tom Siebel, the founder of Siebel Systems (acquired by Oracle for $5.8B). The company focuses on enterprise AI applications at scale, not consumer AI. C3.ai's competitive positioning is enterprise-grade AI with deep vertical specialization — different from horizontal AI platforms like Databricks or Snowflake Cortex. Stock has been volatile ($15-$35 range in 2024-2025), creating potential upside at low entry points. [Source: C3.ai Enterprise AI Platform Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** C3.ai Platform Eng (Senior) = Palantir Forward Deployed Eng = Databricks Platform Eng = Google L4

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Enterprise AI Platform Engineer works across C3.ai's AI application development stack:
- **C3 AI Suite:** Building the low-code/no-code enterprise AI development environment
- **C3 Generative AI:** Enterprise generative AI applications with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- **Vertical AI Applications:** Purpose-built AI apps for predictive maintenance, supply chain, fraud detection, and energy management
- **Federal/Defense AI:** C3.ai has significant US government and defense contracts requiring specialized engineering

**Global Levers**

1. **Tom Siebel Enterprise Pedigree:** "Tom Siebel built and sold Siebel Systems for $5.8B. He's applying the same enterprise playbook to AI. I'm joining a company led by a proven enterprise software billionaire."
2. **Federal AI Premium:** C3.ai has significant government contracts (DoD, intelligence community). If working on federal AI, push for a clearance premium: "Federal AI work requires security clearance and specialized compliance. The talent pool is 10x smaller."
3. **Enterprise AI Vertical Specialization:** "C3.ai's vertical AI applications for energy, defense, and manufacturing have domain-specific requirements that horizontal AI platforms can't address. This specialization justifies premium comp."
4. **Stock Volatility Upside:** "C3.ai stock is volatile, which means the equity could appreciate significantly from current levels. I want a larger grant to maximize the upside potential."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $295K total comp with RSUs at $170K over 4 years. This is C3.ai's defining engineering role — I'm building the enterprise AI platform that generates the company's revenue. I have competing offers from Palantir and Databricks." Counter at $140K-$160K RSUs is competitive.
