### Senior Software Engineer | C3.ai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($4B Market Cap) | Enterprise AI Platform | Tom Siebel-Led | Volatile Stock

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City HQ | $165K–$220K | $80K–$200K | 10% | $205K–$325K |
| Remote US | $150K–$205K | $70K–$180K | 10% | $190K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at C3.ai own significant platform components and lead technical design for enterprise AI applications. At C3.ai's scale, senior engineers have substantial architectural influence — you're designing systems that serve Fortune 500 enterprises and US government agencies. The stock's volatility is a double-edged sword: negotiate a larger RSU grant to hedge the downside while capturing potential upside. Senior engineers at C3.ai are expected to interface directly with enterprise customers, which adds a customer-facing dimension to the technical role. [Source: C3.ai Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** C3.ai Senior SWE = Palantir Senior SWE = Google L4 = Databricks Senior SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Customer Impact:** "As a senior engineer at C3.ai, I architect AI solutions deployed at Fortune 500 companies. My technical decisions directly impact enterprise revenue — not internal tools."
2. **Stock Volatility Premium:** "I need a larger RSU grant to compensate for AI stock volatility. A $200K grant at $25/share is very different from $200K at $15/share."
3. **Full-Stack AI Skills:** "Building enterprise AI requires full-stack skills: ML pipelines, data engineering, API design, and customer deployment. This combination is rarer than typical SWE skills."
4. **Palantir/Databricks Counter:** "I have a Palantir offer where senior engineers are compensated as forward-deployed engineers with premium pay. C3.ai needs to match."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $190K over 4 years. I'm designing enterprise AI systems for Fortune 500 customers, and I need a grant that provides margin of safety against stock volatility." Counter at $155K-$180K RSUs is strong.
