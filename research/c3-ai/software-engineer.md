| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

C3.ai is a public enterprise AI company (NYSE: AI, ~$4B market cap) headquartered in Redwood City, CA, founded by Tom Siebel. SWEs build the C3 AI Suite platform, vertical AI applications, and the C3 Generative AI product. The company's enterprise focus means SWEs work on production AI systems for Fortune 500 companies and US government agencies. C3.ai RSUs vest on a standard 4-year schedule, but the stock's volatility ($15-$35 range) means you should negotiate a larger grant to hedge against downside. The 10% bonus provides some cash stability. [Source: C3.ai SWE Comp Data 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** C3.ai SWE = Palantir SWE = Google L3 = Salesforce MTS

**Global Levers**

1. **Stock Volatility Hedge:** "AI stock has been volatile. I'd like a larger RSU grant to provide a margin of safety. If the stock appreciates, C3.ai benefits from my commitment; if it's flat, I'm still fairly compensated."
2. **Enterprise AI Differentiation:** "C3.ai is one of the few pure-play enterprise AI companies. My work directly builds AI products for Fortune 500 and defense customers."
3. **Palantir/Databricks Counter:** Both compete for the same enterprise AI talent: "I have an offer from Palantir with strong equity. C3.ai needs to be competitive on RSU grants."
4. **Federal Work Premium:** If the role involves government contracts or cleared work, push for 10-15% premium.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $150K over 4 years. Given the stock's volatility, a larger grant provides the margin of safety I need to choose C3.ai over competitors with more stable equity." Counter at $120K-$140K RSUs is acceptable.
