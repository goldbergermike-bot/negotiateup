**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at C3.ai design the user experience for enterprise AI applications. The design challenge is making complex AI/ML workflows accessible to enterprise business users who are not data scientists. C3.ai's platform serves diverse verticals (energy, defense, manufacturing, finance), each with unique UX requirements. The C3 Generative AI product introduces conversational AI interfaces that require sophisticated interaction design. The design team is small, giving each designer significant product ownership.

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise AI UX Complexity:** "Making AI accessible to enterprise business users is one of the hardest UX challenges in software. My designs determine whether customers successfully adopt AI or abandon it."
2. **Vertical Domain Design:** If designing for a specific vertical (energy dashboards, defense command interfaces), push for domain premium: "Defense/energy UX requires specialized domain knowledge and compliance awareness."
3. **Generative AI Interaction Design:** "Designing enterprise conversational AI interfaces is a nascent discipline. My GenAI interaction design skills are in extremely high demand."
4. **Salesforce/Figma Counter:** Both offer liquid equity and higher base for design roles.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $130K over 4 years. I'm designing the UX that determines whether enterprise customers adopt C3.ai or not, and I have offers from companies with liquid equity." Counter at $105K-$125K RSUs is competitive.
