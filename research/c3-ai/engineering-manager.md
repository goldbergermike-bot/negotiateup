### Engineering Manager | C3.ai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($4B Market Cap) | Enterprise AI Platform | Tom Siebel-Led | Volatile Stock

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City HQ | $195K–$250K | $120K–$280K | 10-15% | $270K–$405K |
| Remote US | $180K–$235K | $100K–$250K | 10-15% | $250K–$375K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at C3.ai lead teams building enterprise AI applications and platform capabilities. Tom Siebel's management philosophy emphasizes high-output teams with direct customer impact — EMs are expected to be technically strong and customer-facing. C3.ai's relatively small engineering org means each EM has significant organizational influence. The AI platform pivot and generative AI expansion have created new teams that need experienced EMs. RSU grants at EM level are substantial and should be negotiated aggressively given stock volatility.

**Level Mapping:** C3.ai EM = Palantir EM = Google L5 Manager = Databricks EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Tom Siebel's Enterprise Expectations:** "Tom Siebel built Siebel Systems into the #1 CRM before Salesforce. C3.ai EMs are expected to deliver enterprise-grade AI at that standard. The performance expectation justifies premium comp."
2. **Customer-Facing Leadership:** "C3.ai EMs interface directly with Fortune 500 customers. This is not a pure people-management role — it requires technical leadership AND customer relationship management."
3. **IC Parity:** Staff ICs at C3.ai can earn $280K+ in RSUs. EMs must match: "My equity should be at least equal to the Staff ICs I manage."
4. **Palantir/Google EM Counter:** Both offer competitive EM compensation. Push C3.ai RSUs higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $260K over 4 years. I'm managing a team building enterprise AI products with direct customer impact, and I need comp that exceeds my Staff ICs. I have EM offers from Palantir and Google." Counter at $220K-$250K RSUs is competitive.
