### Security Engineer | C3.ai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($4B Market Cap) | Enterprise AI Platform | Tom Siebel-Led | Federal Security Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City HQ | $155K–$215K | $60K–$180K | 10% | $190K–$310K |
| Remote US | $140K–$200K | $50K–$160K | 10% | $175K–$285K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at C3.ai protect an enterprise AI platform that serves Fortune 500 companies and US government/defense agencies. The security requirements are exceptional: FedRAMP compliance for government deployments, SOC2 for enterprise, HIPAA for healthcare AI applications, and defense-grade security for DoD contracts. AI-specific threats (model poisoning, adversarial attacks, data exfiltration via AI queries) add novel attack vectors. C3.ai's government contracts mean security engineers may need or benefit from security clearances. [Source: C3.ai Security Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** C3.ai Senior Security Eng = Palantir Security Eng = CrowdStrike Senior Eng = Google L4 Security

**Global Levers**

1. **Federal AI Security Premium:** "C3.ai serves US government and defense customers. Security engineering for federal AI workloads requires clearance-eligible engineers with FedRAMP expertise. The talent pool is extremely small."
2. **AI-Specific Threat Surface:** "Enterprise AI introduces novel threats: model poisoning, adversarial attacks, prompt injection, and data exfiltration through AI queries. I bring AI security expertise to a threat landscape most security engineers haven't encountered."
3. **Multi-Vertical Compliance:** "Supporting FedRAMP, SOC2, HIPAA, and defense security simultaneously across one platform is significantly more complex than single-compliance environments."
4. **CrowdStrike/Palo Alto Counter:** Cybersecurity companies offer premium comp with stable equity. Push C3.ai RSUs higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $170K over 4 years. I'm securing an enterprise AI platform with federal compliance requirements and novel AI threat vectors, and I have offers from cybersecurity companies with more stable equity." Counter at $140K-$160K RSUs is competitive.
