**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at C3.ai are the core technical builders of the enterprise AI platform. This role is central to C3.ai's mission — you build the ML frameworks, model serving infrastructure, and AI application templates that enterprise customers use to deploy AI at scale. The C3 Generative AI product (enterprise RAG, LLM integration) represents the company's most significant growth area. C3.ai is one of the few pure-play enterprise AI companies, meaning ML/AI engineering IS the business. The AI premium (15-25%) is justified because this role is the company's reason for existing.
