### ML / AI Engineer | C3.ai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($4B Market Cap) | Enterprise AI Platform | **+15–25% AI PREMIUM** | Tom Siebel-Led

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City HQ | $160K–$225K | $70K–$195K | 10% | $200K–$330K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at C3.ai are the core technical builders of the enterprise AI platform. This role is central to C3.ai's mission — you build the ML frameworks, model serving infrastructure, and AI application templates that enterprise customers use to deploy AI at scale. The C3 Generative AI product (enterprise RAG, LLM integration) represents the company's most significant growth area. C3.ai is one of the few pure-play enterprise AI companies, meaning ML/AI engineering IS the business. The AI premium (15-25%) is justified because this role is the company's reason for existing.

**Level Mapping:** C3.ai ML/AI Eng = Palantir ML Eng = Google L4 ML = Databricks ML Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Pure-Play Enterprise AI:** "C3.ai is a pure-play enterprise AI company. ML/AI engineering isn't a supporting function — it IS the entire business. My comp should reflect that I'm building the core product."
2. **Generative AI Enterprise Applications:** "C3 Generative AI brings LLM-powered applications to enterprises. Building enterprise RAG at scale is the most valuable AI engineering skill in 2026."
3. **Defense/Government AI Premium:** If working on DoD or intelligence community AI applications, push for clearance and mission-critical premium.
4. **Google/Anthropic/OpenAI Counter:** "Top AI companies are offering $400K+ total comp for ML engineers. C3.ai needs to be competitive to attract this talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $315K total comp with RSUs at $185K over 4 years. ML/AI engineering IS C3.ai's business, and I have competing offers from AI companies offering significantly higher comp." Counter at $155K-$175K RSUs is competitive.
