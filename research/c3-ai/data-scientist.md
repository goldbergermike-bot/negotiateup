**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at C3.ai develop the ML models that power enterprise AI applications — predictive maintenance models for manufacturing, fraud detection algorithms for financial services, energy optimization models, and supply chain forecasting. C3.ai's enterprise focus means data scientists work on production ML at scale, not research prototypes. The C3 Generative AI product adds a new dimension: building RAG-based enterprise AI applications. Tom Siebel's enterprise focus means data science is directly tied to customer revenue.

**Level Mapping:** C3.ai Senior DS = Palantir DS = Google L4 DS = Databricks DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Production Enterprise ML:** "At C3.ai, my ML models run in production at Fortune 500 companies. This isn't research or internal analytics — it's production ML that generates enterprise revenue."
2. **Vertical AI Model Expertise:** "Building production ML models for [predictive maintenance/fraud detection/energy optimization] requires deep domain expertise. This specialization commands premium comp."
3. **Generative AI Enterprise Applications:** If working on C3 Generative AI, push for AI premium: "Building enterprise RAG applications is the most in-demand data science skill in 2026."
4. **Google/Meta DS Counter:** Both offer higher base and liquid RSUs for DS roles. Push C3.ai RSUs higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $170K over 4 years. My production ML models directly generate enterprise customer revenue, and I have offers from Google and Databricks with more stable equity." Counter at $140K-$160K RSUs is competitive.
