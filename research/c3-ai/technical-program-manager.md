### Technical Program Manager | C3.ai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($4B Market Cap) | Enterprise AI Platform | Tom Siebel-Led | Volatile Stock

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City HQ | $150K–$205K | $55K–$165K | 10% | $180K–$295K |
| Remote US | $135K–$190K | $45K–$145K | 10% | $165K–$270K |

**Negotiation DNA**

TPMs at C3.ai coordinate cross-functional enterprise AI programs. Key programs include the C3 AI Suite platform releases, C3 Generative AI product launches, government contract deliverables, and enterprise customer deployment programs. C3.ai's enterprise focus means TPMs must manage programs with external customer milestones, compliance deadlines, and government contract requirements — more complex than pure-SaaS program management. Tom Siebel's enterprise background means programs are run with high accountability and clear deliverables. [Source: C3.ai TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** C3.ai Senior TPM = Palantir Senior TPM = Google L5 TPM = Salesforce Senior TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Customer Milestones:** "C3.ai TPMs manage programs with external Fortune 500 customer deadlines, not just internal releases. Missing a customer milestone has direct revenue impact."
2. **Government Contract Compliance:** If managing government programs, push for premium: "Government contracts have strict deliverable timelines, compliance requirements, and audit trails. This is more complex than commercial program management."
3. **Cross-Vertical Coordination:** "I'm coordinating AI programs across multiple verticals (energy, defense, finance), each with unique requirements. This multi-domain coordination is rare."
4. **Google/Salesforce TPM Counter:** Both offer liquid equity and higher base for TPM roles.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $155K over 4 years. I'm managing enterprise AI programs with external customer and government contract deadlines, and I have TPM offers from Google and Salesforce with liquid RSUs." Counter at $125K-$145K RSUs is competitive.
