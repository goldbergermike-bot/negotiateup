**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at C3.ai build the data pipelines that power enterprise AI applications. C3.ai's platform ingests massive datasets from industrial sensors (IoT), financial systems, supply chain networks, and defense systems. The data engineering challenge is enterprise-grade: integrating heterogeneous data sources at scale with strict compliance, latency, and reliability requirements. C3.ai's vertical AI applications (predictive maintenance, fraud detection, energy management) each have unique data pipeline requirements. [Source: C3.ai DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** C3.ai Senior DE = Palantir DE = Databricks DE = Google L4 DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Data Integration Complexity:** "C3.ai ingests data from industrial IoT sensors, financial systems, and defense networks. This is not standard data warehousing — it's enterprise-scale, multi-source data integration with strict compliance requirements."
2. **Vertical Domain Expertise:** If specializing in a vertical (energy, defense, financial services), push for domain premium: "My domain expertise in [energy/defense/finance] data systems is directly applicable and scarce."
3. **Federal Data Pipeline Clearance:** If working on defense/government data pipelines, push for clearance premium.
4. **Databricks/Snowflake DE Counter:** Both pay higher and offer more stable equity for DE roles. Use as leverage.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $160K over 4 years. I'm building enterprise data pipelines for Fortune 500 and government AI applications, and I have competing offers from Databricks with pre-IPO equity." Counter at $130K-$150K RSUs is competitive.
