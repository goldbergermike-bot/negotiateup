**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Engineers at C3.ai are the technical leaders who define the architecture of the enterprise AI platform. At C3.ai's company size, Staff Engineers are domain-level technical leaders with significant influence over product direction. Tom Siebel's enterprise software pedigree (Siebel Systems) means the company values engineering leaders who can build scalable, enterprise-grade systems. Staff Engineers work across the C3 AI Suite, generative AI products, and vertical applications. The RSU grant at this level is substantial and should be negotiated aggressively given stock volatility. [Source: C3.ai Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]
