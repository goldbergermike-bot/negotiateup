**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at C3.ai manage the cloud infrastructure that runs enterprise AI workloads for Fortune 500 and government customers. C3.ai deploys across AWS, Azure, and GCP, with some on-premise deployments for defense and regulated industries. The infrastructure must support ML model training, real-time inference, and large-scale data processing with enterprise-grade reliability and compliance (FedRAMP, SOC2, HIPAA). DevOps at C3.ai is mission-critical because downtime directly impacts enterprise customer AI operations. [Source: C3.ai DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** C3.ai Senior DevOps = Palantir Infrastructure Eng = Google L4 SRE = Databricks DevOps

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise AI Infrastructure:** "Running enterprise AI workloads across multi-cloud with FedRAMP, SOC2, and HIPAA compliance is significantly more complex than standard SaaS infrastructure."
2. **Federal Infrastructure Clearance:** If managing government cloud infrastructure, push for 15-20% clearance premium.
3. **ML Training Infrastructure:** "Supporting ML model training at enterprise scale requires GPU cluster management, distributed computing optimization, and cost control expertise."
4. **Datadog/HashiCorp Counter:** Both offer higher base and more stable equity for infrastructure roles.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $150K over 4 years. I'm managing enterprise AI infrastructure with federal compliance requirements across multi-cloud, and I have offers from infrastructure-focused companies with more stable equity." Counter at $120K-$140K RSUs is acceptable.
