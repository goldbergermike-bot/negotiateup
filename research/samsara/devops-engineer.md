**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Samsara build and maintain the infrastructure that powers the Industrial AGI platform — the systems that ingest, process, and serve data from millions of connected IoT devices in real-time with extreme reliability requirements. When a fleet relies on Samsara for safety-critical AI coaching, the infrastructure must be flawless. GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 validates the operational efficiency that DevOps enables, and the Super Bowl AI Coach launch required infrastructure capable of handling massive traffic spikes during the biggest broadcast event of the year. Your work is the invisible foundation of Industrial AGI.

**Level Mapping:**

- Samsara DevOps Engineer = Google L4/L5 SRE = Meta Production Engineer = Amazon Systems Dev Engineer = Apple SRE
- Samsara DevOps roles carry higher scope than equivalents at SaaS-only companies due to IoT-specific infrastructure challenges (edge computing, device management, real-time data)
- Strong path to Staff/Principal infrastructure roles given Samsara's rapidly scaling device fleet

**GAAP Profitability — The Industrial AGI Architect Premium**

DevOps Engineers are the infrastructure Industrial AGI Architects — you build the reliable, scalable foundation that allows Samsara's AI to operate across millions of physical devices in real-time. GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 is partly a DevOps achievement: operational efficiency, infrastructure cost optimization, and system reliability are direct contributors to the margin improvement that enabled profitability. This gives you concrete negotiation leverage — your work has measurable impact on the company's financial performance. Unlike DevOps roles at unprofitable AI startups where infrastructure is viewed as a cost center to minimize, Samsara's profitability proves that well-invested infrastructure is a profit driver. The Super Bowl AI Coach — an AI coaching system for fleet drivers debuted during the Super Bowl — tested the infrastructure at peak scale, handling millions of concurrent users during a single broadcast event. As a DevOps engineer, you would ensure the Industrial AGI platform maintains five-nines reliability while scaling to tens of millions of connected devices. Use GAAP profitability to argue that your infrastructure work drives margin (not just uptime), and the Super Bowl event as proof that Samsara infrastructure operates at world-class scale. Your compensation should reflect both the financial impact and the extreme reliability demands of industrial IoT at scale.

**Global Levers**

1. **Infrastructure as Profit Driver:** "Samsara's GAAP profitability is partly an infrastructure achievement — efficient, well-architected systems drive margin. I'd like comp reflecting DevOps as a profit center, not a cost center."
2. **IoT-Scale Complexity:** "Managing infrastructure for millions of IoT devices — with real-time data ingestion, edge computing, and five-nines reliability requirements — is far more complex than standard SaaS DevOps. My experience with [Kubernetes at scale/IoT infrastructure/edge computing] directly maps."
3. **Super Bowl-Scale Resilience:** "The AI Coach Super Bowl launch required infrastructure that handled massive traffic spikes flawlessly. I've operated at that scale at [Previous Company] — let's set comp accordingly."
4. **Competing Infrastructure Offers:** "I have a DevOps/SRE offer from [Cloudflare/Datadog/CrowdStrike] at $230K TC — Samsara's Industrial AGI mission is more compelling, but I need the numbers to close the gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the DevOps Engineer role at Samsara — building the infrastructure foundation for Industrial AGI is exactly the challenge I'm looking for. My target total comp is $225K–$238K, based on my experience running [IoT/real-time/large-scale] infrastructure at [Previous Company]. I have a competing offer from [Cloudflare/Datadog] at $228K TC for a standard SaaS infrastructure role. Samsara's GAAP profitability means my infrastructure work drives measurable margin improvement, and the Super Bowl AI Coach launch proves you operate at world-class scale. I'd like a base of $170K, RSU grant of $125K/4yr, and a 10% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $205K TC. Let's finalize so I can start building the Industrial AGI infrastructure."
