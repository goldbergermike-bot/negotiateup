### Engineering Manager | Samsara Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Industrial IoT & AI Platform | GAAP Profitable | Super Bowl AI Coach | +8% Management Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $195K–$235K | $145K–$260K | 12–18% | $315K–$362K |
| Atlanta | $168K–$202K | $120K–$215K | 12–18% | $258K–$300K |
| Remote US | $178K–$218K | $130K–$235K | 12–18% | $280K–$335K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Samsara lead the teams building the Industrial AGI platform — combining people leadership with deep technical context across IoT hardware, real-time data infrastructure, and AI/ML systems. With GAAP profitability achieved in Q3 FY26, Samsara offers EMs the rare combination of a high-growth engineering organization backed by sustainable economics. The Super Bowl AI Coach launch exemplifies the caliber of cross-functional execution Samsara demands from its engineering leadership: shipping AI products at global scale under extreme visibility and time pressure.

**Level Mapping:**

- Samsara EM (Engineering Manager) = Google L5/L6 Manager = Meta M1 = Amazon SDM = Apple EM
- Samsara EMs typically manage 6–12 engineers with significant technical decision-making authority
- Many FAANG EMs lateral to Samsara for broader scope — managing across hardware, firmware, cloud, and ML boundaries

**GAAP Profitability — The Industrial AGI Architect Premium**

As an Engineering Manager at Samsara, you are the organizational Industrial AGI Architect — you build and lead the teams that construct AI systems bridging the digital-physical divide. GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 gives you unique leverage in negotiation. First, it signals that Samsara's engineering org is well-managed and efficient — leadership is valued and retained, not cut during restructuring cycles common at unprofitable AI companies. Second, your equity is backed by demonstrated earnings, not speculative growth; this means you can confidently negotiate for larger RSU grants knowing the stock price has a floor supported by real profitability. Third, the Super Bowl AI Coach — an AI coaching system for fleet drivers debuted during the Super Bowl — proves that Samsara ships products with cultural impact, which means your team's work gets recognition far beyond typical B2B software. Use this combination to justify premium comp: you are leading teams at a profitable company building Industrial AGI products seen by hundreds of millions. Unlike EM roles at cash-burning startups where your team might be downsized, Samsara's profitability ensures organizational stability and investment in your team's growth.

**Global Levers**

1. **Organizational Leverage:** "As EM, I'll be responsible for the team building [platform component] — the hiring, retention, and delivery outcomes that directly impact Samsara's Industrial AGI roadmap. I'd like comp reflecting that organizational ownership."
2. **GAAP Stability for Team Building:** "Samsara's profitability means I can confidently build and retain a team without the restructuring risk at unprofitable companies — I'd like my comp to reflect that I'm choosing stability AND impact."
3. **Cross-Domain Leadership:** "Managing across IoT hardware, cloud infrastructure, and ML systems requires a rare blend of technical breadth — few EMs can credibly lead across these domains, and I'd expect compensation above standard SaaS EM bands."
4. **Super Bowl Execution Standard:** "The AI Coach Super Bowl launch shows the execution bar for engineering leadership here. I've delivered at that caliber at [Previous Company] — let's set comp at a level that reflects that track record."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about leading an engineering team at Samsara and building the Industrial AGI platform. My target total comp is $345K–$362K, based on my track record managing [X-person] teams shipping [IoT/AI/infrastructure] products at [Previous Company]. I have a competing offer from [Datadog/Cloudflare/HashiCorp] at $340K TC for a similar EM role. Samsara's GAAP profitability makes the equity component more attractive — I'd like a base of $225K, RSU grant of $250K/4yr, and a 15% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $310K TC. The Super Bowl AI Coach proves this company ships at the highest level, and I want to lead teams that deliver that — let's get the numbers aligned."
