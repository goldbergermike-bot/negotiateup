### Security Engineer | Samsara Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Industrial IoT & AI Platform | GAAP Profitable | Super Bowl AI Coach | +10% Security Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $162K–$195K | $90K–$168K | 10–15% | $235K–$272K |
| Atlanta | $138K–$167K | $75K–$140K | 10–15% | $195K–$228K |
| Remote US | $148K–$180K | $80K–$152K | 10–15% | $212K–$248K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Samsara protect one of the world's most sensitive industrial data platforms — securing the cameras, sensors, telematics devices, and AI systems that monitor fleets, warehouses, and critical infrastructure worldwide. A security breach at Samsara doesn't just leak data; it could compromise physical safety for millions of workers and drivers. GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 enables sustained investment in security (unlike cash-strapped startups that underinvest), and the Super Bowl AI Coach launch required security at consumer-scale visibility for industrial-grade systems. Your work guards the digital-physical bridge of Industrial AGI.

**Level Mapping:**

- Samsara Security Engineer = Google L4/L5 Security Engineer = Meta Security Engineer = Amazon Security Engineer = CrowdStrike Engineer
- Samsara security roles span IoT device security, cloud infrastructure security, AI/ML model security, and compliance — broader than SaaS-only security
- Growing security team with direct CISO visibility due to safety-critical nature of the platform

**GAAP Profitability — The Industrial AGI Architect Premium**

Security Engineers at Samsara are the protective Industrial AGI Architects — you ensure that the AI systems bridging the digital-physical divide are secure, compliant, and trustworthy. GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 directly supports your negotiation in two ways. First, profitable companies invest more in security than unprofitable ones — security is an existential function at Samsara (a breach affecting fleet safety could destroy the business), and profitability ensures this investment is sustained long-term. Second, your equity is backed by real earnings: unlike security roles at unprofitable AI startups where your options may be worthless, Samsara's RSUs are tied to a demonstrably profitable company. The Super Bowl AI Coach — an AI coaching system for fleet drivers debuted during the Super Bowl — exposed Samsara's systems to massive public scrutiny and potential attack surface during the biggest broadcast event of the year. Securing Industrial AGI means protecting not just data, but physical safety: cameras that monitor driver behavior, sensors that detect hazardous conditions, and AI that makes safety-critical recommendations. This is a fundamentally higher-stakes security challenge than protecting a SaaS dashboard, and your compensation should reflect that. Use GAAP profitability to argue for premium equity grants and the Super Bowl launch as proof that your security work operates at the highest visibility and stakes.

**Global Levers**

1. **Safety-Critical Security Scope:** "Securing an Industrial AGI platform where breaches can affect physical safety — not just data — is a fundamentally higher-stakes challenge. I have experience in [IoT security/OT security/embedded device security] that directly maps to this."
2. **GAAP-Funded Security Investment:** "Samsara's profitability ensures sustained investment in security, unlike unprofitable companies that cut security budgets during downturns. I'd like comp reflecting that I'm joining a company that values security as existential."
3. **Super Bowl Attack Surface:** "The AI Coach Super Bowl launch massively expanded Samsara's attack surface under global scrutiny. I've secured systems at that scale and visibility at [Previous Company] — let's set comp accordingly."
4. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers with IoT/industrial/AI expertise are the scarcest talent in cybersecurity. I have competing offers from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto Networks/Zscaler] at $265K+ TC that reflect this premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm compelled by Samsara's security challenge — protecting an Industrial AGI platform where security failures have physical safety consequences. My target total comp is $258K–$272K, based on my experience in [IoT security/cloud security/AI system security] at [Previous Company] and the extreme scarcity of security engineers with industrial/IoT expertise. I have a competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto Networks] at $262K TC. Samsara's GAAP profitability means my equity is de-risked and the company can sustain security investment, while the Super Bowl AI Coach launch proves these systems operate at the highest visibility and stakes. I'd like a base of $190K, RSU grant of $160K/4yr, and a 12% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $235K TC. Let's finalize — I want to secure the Industrial AGI platform."
