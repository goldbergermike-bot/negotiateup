**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Samsara unlock insights from one of the world's richest industrial data sets — billions of data points from connected cameras, sensors, GPS trackers, and telematics devices operating across fleets, warehouses, and job sites globally. With GAAP profitability achieved in Q3 FY26, your analytical work directly contributes to a proven, profitable business model. The Super Bowl AI Coach launch demonstrates that data science at Samsara translates into real-world AI products with massive visibility. You turn raw physical-world data into the intelligence that powers Industrial AGI.

**Level Mapping:**

- Samsara Data Scientist = Google L4/L5 Data Scientist = Meta Data Scientist IC4 = Amazon DS = Apple DS
- Samsara data scientists work across product analytics, ML feature development, and business intelligence
- Higher ML exposure than typical DS roles due to Samsara's AI-first product strategy

**GAAP Profitability — The Industrial AGI Architect Premium**

Data Scientists at Samsara are the analytical Industrial AGI Architects — you extract meaning from the physical world's data and turn it into intelligence that drives products, business decisions, and AI models. GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 directly validates the data-driven product strategy: Samsara's ability to monetize industrial data at scale is what generates profit, and your work is at the center of that value chain. Unlike data science roles at unprofitable AI startups where your models may never reach production or your team may be restructured, Samsara's profitability ensures sustained investment in data science as a core function. The Super Bowl AI Coach — an AI coaching system for fleet drivers debuted during the Super Bowl — was built on the data science team's insights into driver behavior, safety patterns, and coaching effectiveness, proving that your analytical work directly powers consumer-visible AI products. Use GAAP profitability to justify equity confidence (your RSUs are in a company with proven monetization of the exact data you analyze), and use the Super Bowl AI Coach to demonstrate that data science at Samsara has outsized product and cultural impact. You deserve compensation that reflects both the rarity of your industrial data expertise and the profitability your work enables.

**Global Levers**

1. **Unique Data Asset:** "Samsara's industrial data set — billions of data points from cameras, sensors, and telematics — is one of the most valuable in the world. My experience in [time-series analysis/sensor data/fleet analytics] lets me extract the insights that drive GAAP profitability."
2. **GAAP-Validated Impact:** "Samsara's profitability proves that data-driven products generate real revenue. My analytical work directly contributes to the bottom line — I'd like compensation reflecting that measurable business impact."
3. **AI Coach Data Foundation:** "The Super Bowl AI Coach was built on data science insights into driver behavior and safety patterns. I want to build the next generation of these data-powered products — at compensation reflecting that product impact."
4. **Industrial Data Science Scarcity:** "Data scientists who can work with physical-world sensor data at scale are far rarer than those working with standard web/SaaS data. I have competing offers from [Palantir/Scale AI/Tesla] that reflect this scarcity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the Data Scientist role at Samsara and the opportunity to work with one of the world's richest industrial data sets. My target total comp is $242K–$258K, anchored by my experience in [sensor data analysis/ML feature engineering/industrial analytics] at [Previous Company]. I'm comparing against offers from [Palantir/Scale AI/Databricks] in the $240K–$260K TC range. Samsara's GAAP profitability means my work directly contributes to a proven business model, and the Super Bowl AI Coach proves data science here powers globally visible products. I'd like a base of $180K, RSU grant of $148K/4yr, and a 12% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $225K TC. Let's align on numbers so I can start driving Industrial AGI insights."
