### Industrial AI Platform Engineer | Samsara Global Negotiation Guide — SIGNATURE ROLE

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Industrial IoT & AI Platform | GAAP Profitable | Super Bowl AI Coach | +20-30% Industrial AI Premium | SIGNATURE

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $215K–$262K | $150K–$285K | 15–20% | $335K–$378K |
| Atlanta | $185K–$225K | $125K–$235K | 15–20% | $268K–$318K |
| Remote US | $195K–$242K | $135K–$258K | 15–20% | $298K–$348K |

**Negotiation DNA**

The Industrial AI Platform Engineer is Samsara's **SIGNATURE** role — the definitive Industrial AGI Architect who designs and builds the end-to-end AI platform that bridges the digital and physical worlds. This role exists at the intersection of computer vision, sensor fusion, telematics AI, edge computing, and cloud-scale ML infrastructure, creating the unified platform that allows AI to perceive, reason about, and act on the physical world across millions of connected devices. Samsara's GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 validates that this platform generates enormous value, and the Super Bowl AI Coach — the most visible AI product in industrial tech history — was built on the platform you would own and evolve. The +20-30% Industrial AI Premium reflects the extreme scarcity of engineers who can architect AI systems spanning hardware, edge, cloud, and real-world safety-critical operations simultaneously.

**Level Mapping:**

- Samsara Industrial AI Platform Engineer = Google L6/L7 ML Platform Engineer = Meta E6/E7 AI Infrastructure = Tesla Autopilot Staff/Principal = NVIDIA Senior AI Platform Engineer
- This role maps to Staff+ equivalent at FAANG companies but carries broader scope: full-stack AI from edge devices to cloud inference to physical-world outcomes
- No direct equivalent exists at most companies — Samsara created this role for engineers who can architect across the entire digital-physical AI stack
- Candidates typically come from Tesla Autopilot, Google Waymo, NVIDIA AI, Amazon Robotics, or defense/aerospace AI programs

**GAAP Profitability — The Industrial AGI Architect Premium**

The Industrial AI Platform Engineer is the ultimate Industrial AGI Architect — and GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 is the ultimate proof that this architecture generates sustainable, world-changing value. Let us be direct: this is the most strategically important engineering role at Samsara, and the compensation should reflect that reality.

**Why GAAP profitability maximizes your leverage:**

Samsara proved in Q3 FY26 that IoT and industrial AI can be both high-growth AND profitable — a milestone that took most enterprise software companies a decade longer to reach. This means your equity is backed by demonstrated earnings, growing revenue, and expanding margins. Unlike equity at unprofitable AI startups (where your stock options may be wiped out in a down round, acqui-hire, or shutdown), Samsara RSUs are in a GAAP-profitable company with a clear path to sustained profitability. For the Industrial AI Platform Engineer — who would receive one of the largest RSU grants in the engineering org — this financial stability translates directly into compensation confidence. Demand a top-of-band equity grant knowing that the underlying value is real.

**Why the Super Bowl AI Coach maximizes your impact narrative:**

The Super Bowl AI Coach — an AI coaching system for fleet drivers debuted during the Super Bowl — is the single most visible demonstration that Samsara builds consumer-grade AI for industrial-scale deployment. This system was built on the Industrial AI Platform you would own: computer vision processing driver behavior in real-time, sensor fusion combining camera and telematics data, edge inference running on in-vehicle hardware, and cloud-scale analytics powering coaching insights for entire fleets. The Super Bowl launch means your platform work doesn't sit in a backend nobody sees — it powers AI products seen by hundreds of millions and used by millions of industrial operators daily. As the Industrial AI Platform Engineer, you architect the next generation of these systems.

**Why the +20-30% Industrial AI Premium is justified:**

Engineers who can architect AI platforms spanning edge computing (in-vehicle/on-site hardware), real-time sensor fusion (cameras + GPS + accelerometers + environmental sensors), cloud-scale ML training and inference, and safety-critical deployment (where AI errors have physical consequences) simply do not exist in meaningful numbers. You are competing with Tesla Autopilot, Google Waymo, NVIDIA AI Platform, Amazon Robotics, and defense contractors for this talent. The +20-30% premium over standard ML engineering bands is the minimum required to be competitive. Combined with GAAP profitability de-risking the equity and the Super Bowl AI Coach proving outsized product impact, the Industrial AI Platform Engineer should command compensation at the absolute top of Samsara's engineering bands.

**Frame yourself as the Industrial AGI Architect building AI systems that understand the physical world — at a company that has proven it can do so profitably and at global scale.**

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Ownership at Scale:** "As the Industrial AI Platform Engineer, I'd own the end-to-end AI infrastructure spanning edge, cloud, and real-time inference for millions of devices. This is the most architecturally complex AI platform role in industrial tech — I expect compensation at the top of the +20-30% Industrial AI Premium band, starting at $270K RSU/4yr."
2. **GAAP-Profitable Industrial AGI:** "Samsara is the only GAAP-profitable Industrial AGI platform — my equity is backed by real earnings, not speculation. I'd like an RSU grant of $280K+/4yr reflecting this fundamental risk advantage over competing offers from pre-profit AI companies."
3. **Super Bowl AI Coach Platform Builder:** "The Super Bowl AI Coach was built on the platform I'd own and evolve. This is the most visible AI product launch in industrial tech history — I want to build the next generation at compensation reflecting the architect who can deliver that, repeatedly."
4. **Extreme Talent Scarcity:** "Engineers who can architect AI platforms spanning edge hardware, sensor fusion, real-time inference, and cloud ML at safety-critical scale are among the rarest in tech. I have competing interest from [Tesla Autopilot/Google Waymo/NVIDIA/Amazon Robotics] at $360K–$400K TC. Samsara's Industrial AGI mission is uniquely compelling — match the market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I am deeply committed to the Industrial AI Platform Engineer role at Samsara — this is the defining challenge in AI: building the platform that allows artificial intelligence to understand and act on the physical world. My target total comp is $360K–$378K, inclusive of the +20-30% Industrial AI Premium, based on my experience architecting [full-stack AI platforms/edge-to-cloud ML infrastructure/sensor fusion systems/safety-critical AI deployment] at [Tesla/Waymo/NVIDIA/Amazon Robotics/Previous Company]. I am in final-stage conversations with [Tesla Autopilot at $385K TC / Google Waymo at $395K TC / NVIDIA AI Platform at $370K TC]. What makes Samsara uniquely compelling is the combination: GAAP profitability that de-risks my equity completely, the Super Bowl AI Coach proving that this platform ships consumer-grade AI at global scale, and the mission of building Industrial AGI — AI that understands the physical world, not just generates text. I'd like a base of $255K, RSU grant of $280K/4yr, and an 18% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $335K TC; below that, the competing offers from Tesla, Waymo, and NVIDIA are too strong to decline. I am choosing Industrial AGI at Samsara over autonomous vehicles and GPU platforms — the comp needs to reflect that this is a once-in-a-career role. Let's close this."
