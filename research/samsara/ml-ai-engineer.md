### ML/AI Engineer | Samsara Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Industrial IoT & AI Platform | GAAP Profitable | Super Bowl AI Coach | +15-25% AI Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K–$225K | $115K–$210K | 12–18% | $278K–$315K |
| Atlanta | $158K–$192K | $95K–$175K | 12–18% | $225K–$262K |
| Remote US | $168K–$205K | $105K–$190K | 12–18% | $248K–$288K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Samsara build the intelligence at the heart of the Industrial AGI platform — developing the computer vision models, natural language processing systems, predictive analytics algorithms, and reinforcement learning systems that allow AI to perceive, reason about, and act on the physical world through cameras, sensors, and telematics. You carry a +15-25% AI Premium above standard engineering bands because Industrial AI talent is the scarcest and most strategically valuable in the company. Samsara's GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 proves that your AI models generate real revenue, and the Super Bowl AI Coach — built by your team — demonstrates consumer-grade AI deployed at the world's biggest stage.

**Level Mapping:**

- Samsara ML/AI Engineer = Google L5/L6 ML Engineer = Meta ML Engineer E5/E6 = Amazon Applied Scientist = Apple ML Engineer
- Samsara ML/AI engineers work on production systems with real-world safety implications — not research prototypes
- AI Premium (+15-25%) is applied because Samsara competes directly with Google, Meta, Tesla, and NVIDIA for ML talent

**GAAP Profitability — The Industrial AGI Architect Premium**

ML/AI Engineers at Samsara are the core Industrial AGI Architects — you literally build the AI systems that understand the physical world. GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 is the strongest possible validation of your work: it proves that Industrial AI generates sustainable profit, not just impressive demos. This is your ultimate negotiation weapon against unprofitable AI startups and research labs. At Samsara, your models ship to millions of real-world users and directly drive revenue — unlike research-oriented AI roles where models may never reach production. The Super Bowl AI Coach — an AI coaching system for fleet drivers debuted during the Super Bowl — is the flagship product of the ML/AI team: a system that uses computer vision, telematics data, and behavioral AI to coach fleet drivers in real-time, showcased to the largest TV audience of the year. This is Industrial AGI in action — AI that doesn't just generate text or images, but understands and improves how humans operate in the physical world. As an ML/AI Engineer, you should negotiate with the full force of this positioning: (1) GAAP profitability proves your AI work generates real profit, de-risking your equity; (2) the Super Bowl AI Coach proves your models ship at consumer-grade quality for industrial-scale impact; (3) Industrial AI talent is the scarcest category in tech, and you are competing against offers from Google DeepMind, Tesla AI, NVIDIA, and OpenAI. The +15-25% AI Premium is not generous — it is the minimum required to be competitive. Push for the top of band.

**Global Levers**

1. **Industrial AI Scarcity Premium:** "ML engineers who can build production AI systems for physical-world perception — computer vision, sensor fusion, telematics AI — are the scarcest talent in tech. My competing offers from [Google DeepMind/Tesla/NVIDIA/OpenAI] at $300K+ TC reflect this reality."
2. **GAAP-Profitable AI Validation:** "Unlike AI startups burning cash on research, my models at Samsara ship to millions of users and drive real profit. My equity is backed by GAAP profitability — I expect the RSU grant to reflect this lower risk with a $200K+ 4yr allocation."
3. **Super Bowl AI Coach Builder:** "The Super Bowl AI Coach is the most visible AI product launch in industrial tech history. I want to build the next generation of these systems — at compensation reflecting the engineer who can deliver at that caliber."
4. **Production AI vs. Research:** "I'm choosing production AI impact over pure research. Samsara's AI ships to the real world — that's harder and more valuable than publishing papers. My comp should reflect the premium for production ML engineering."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply excited about the ML/AI Engineer role at Samsara — building the AI that understands the physical world is the most important problem in tech. My target total comp is $298K–$315K, inclusive of the AI Premium, based on my experience building [computer vision/NLP/reinforcement learning/sensor fusion] systems at [Previous Company]. I am in late-stage conversations with [Google DeepMind/Tesla AI/OpenAI/NVIDIA] with offers ranging $295K–$340K TC. What differentiates Samsara is the combination of GAAP profitability — my equity is de-risked — AND the Super Bowl AI Coach proving that your AI ships to the real world at consumer-grade quality. I'd like a base of $218K, RSU grant of $200K/4yr, and a 15% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $278K TC; below that, the research-lab offers become too compelling. I'm choosing Industrial AGI — make the numbers match the mission."
