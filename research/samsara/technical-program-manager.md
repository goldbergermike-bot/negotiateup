### Technical Program Manager | Samsara Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Industrial IoT & AI Platform | GAAP Profitable | Super Bowl AI Coach | +5% Cross-Functional Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

| San Francisco | $148K–$175K | $72K–$135K | 8–12% | $208K–$242K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Samsara orchestrate the cross-functional execution of the Industrial AGI platform — coordinating across hardware, firmware, cloud, AI/ML, and product teams to deliver integrated solutions that bridge the digital-physical divide. Samsara's GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 reflects the operational excellence that TPMs enable, and the Super Bowl AI Coach launch — a high-stakes, deadline-driven program involving engineering, design, marketing, and operations — is the archetype of programs TPMs drive at Samsara. Your ability to ship complex, multi-disciplinary products on time and at quality is the backbone of Industrial AGI delivery.

**Level Mapping:**

- Samsara TPM = Google TPM L5/L6 = Meta TPM = Amazon TPM = Apple TPM
- Samsara TPMs manage programs spanning hardware, software, and AI — broader scope than SaaS-only TPM roles
- Smaller TPM team relative to program surface area means higher visibility and impact per person

**GAAP Profitability — The Industrial AGI Architect Premium**

Technical Program Managers at Samsara are the operational Industrial AGI Architects — you design the execution frameworks that allow complex, multi-disciplinary programs to ship on time, at quality, and at scale. GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 is a direct reflection of TPM excellence: programs that ship efficiently drive revenue, reduce cost, and improve margins. This gives you concrete negotiation leverage — your program management directly contributes to the financial outcomes that enabled profitability. Unlike TPM roles at unprofitable AI startups where programs may be killed mid-execution or teams reshuffled during restructuring, Samsara's profitability ensures stable, well-funded programs with clear business objectives. The Super Bowl AI Coach — an AI coaching system for fleet drivers debuted during the Super Bowl — was one of the most complex programs in Samsara's history: coordinating engineering, design, product, marketing, and operations for a globally visible launch under an immovable deadline. As a TPM, you would drive programs of this caliber regularly. Use GAAP profitability to argue that your program delivery has measurable financial impact, and the Super Bowl launch as proof that Samsara programs operate at the highest stakes. TPMs who can manage across hardware, software, and AI boundaries are rare — demand compensation reflecting that cross-domain expertise.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Domain Program Expertise:** "Managing programs that span hardware, cloud software, and AI/ML is far more complex than SaaS-only program management. My experience coordinating across [hardware/software/AI] teams directly maps to Samsara's needs."
2. **GAAP-Proven Execution Impact:** "Samsara's GAAP profitability reflects efficient program execution — programs that ship on time drive revenue and margin. I'd like comp reflecting the financial impact of strong TPM leadership."
3. **Super Bowl-Scale Program Delivery:** "The AI Coach Super Bowl launch was a high-stakes, cross-functional program with an immovable deadline. I've delivered at that scale and pressure at [Previous Company] — comp should reflect that program leadership caliber."
4. **Competing TPM Offers:** "I have a TPM offer from [Google/Amazon/Datadog] at $235K TC. Samsara's Industrial AGI mission is more exciting, but I need the numbers to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm aligned with Samsara's Industrial AGI vision and the TPM role's challenge of orchestrating programs across hardware, software, and AI. My target total comp is $230K–$242K, based on my track record delivering [IoT/AI/cross-functional] programs at [Previous Company]. I'm comparing against offers from [Google/Amazon/Datadog] in the $228K–$245K TC range. Samsara's GAAP profitability means my program execution drives real financial outcomes, and the Super Bowl AI Coach launch proves TPMs here operate at the highest stakes. I'd like a base of $170K, RSU grant of $130K/4yr, and a 10% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $208K TC. I want to drive the programs that ship Industrial AGI — let's finalize the comp."
