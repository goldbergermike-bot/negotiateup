### Data Engineer | Samsara Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Industrial IoT & AI Platform | GAAP Profitable | Super Bowl AI Coach | +8% Data Infrastructure Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $148K–$178K | $75K–$140K | 8–12% | $212K–$245K |
| Atlanta | $125K–$152K | $62K–$115K | 8–12% | $175K–$205K |
| Remote US | $135K–$165K | $68K–$125K | 8–12% | $190K–$222K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Samsara build the data pipelines that power the Industrial AGI platform — ingesting, transforming, and serving billions of data points per day from connected cameras, sensors, GPS trackers, and telematics devices across global fleets and industrial operations. Samsara's GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 is directly enabled by efficient data infrastructure — your pipelines are the arteries through which industrial intelligence flows. The Super Bowl AI Coach launch demonstrated the scale and reliability demands that data engineers at Samsara must deliver: real-time data processing at consumer-broadcast scale for safety-critical industrial AI.

**Level Mapping:**

- Samsara Data Engineer = Google L4/L5 Data Engineer = Meta Data Engineer = Amazon Data Engineer = Snowflake Data Engineer
- Samsara data engineers work with IoT-scale data (billions of events/day) — significantly higher volume and velocity than typical SaaS data engineering
- Strong path to Staff/Principal data engineering roles as data volumes scale with device fleet growth

**GAAP Profitability — The Industrial AGI Architect Premium**

Data Engineers at Samsara are the pipeline Industrial AGI Architects — you build the data systems that transform raw physical-world signals into the structured intelligence that powers AI models, product features, and business decisions. GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 validates the data infrastructure strategy: efficient, well-designed data pipelines reduce compute costs, improve model performance, and enable the data products that drive revenue. Your work is a direct contributor to the margin improvement that enabled profitability. Unlike data engineering roles at unprofitable AI startups where data infrastructure budgets are cut during restructuring, Samsara's profitability ensures continued investment in the data platform as a core business asset. The Super Bowl AI Coach — an AI coaching system for fleet drivers debuted during the Super Bowl — required data pipelines capable of processing real-time driver behavior data at massive scale with zero downtime during the most-watched broadcast event. As a Data Engineer, you build the systems that make Industrial AGI possible — without your pipelines, the AI has no data to learn from. Use GAAP profitability to argue that your data infrastructure work directly drives financial performance (lower compute costs, better data products, faster feature velocity), and the Super Bowl AI Coach as proof that data engineering at Samsara operates at world-class scale and reliability requirements. Demand compensation that reflects both the technical complexity of IoT-scale data and the direct business impact of your work.

**Global Levers**

1. **IoT-Scale Data Complexity:** "Building data pipelines for billions of IoT events per day — from cameras, sensors, and telematics — is fundamentally more complex than standard SaaS data engineering. My experience with [streaming data/real-time pipelines/IoT data] directly maps."
2. **GAAP-Contributing Infrastructure:** "Efficient data infrastructure directly drives Samsara's margins. My pipeline optimization work at [Previous Company] reduced compute costs by X% — I'd like comp reflecting this direct financial impact."
3. **Super Bowl-Scale Reliability:** "The AI Coach Super Bowl launch required data pipelines with zero downtime at peak scale. I've built systems at that reliability level at [Previous Company] — compensation should reflect that standard."
4. **Data Engineering Market Demand:** "Data engineers with IoT/streaming/real-time experience are in extreme demand. I have competing offers from [Databricks/Snowflake/Confluent] at $240K+ TC that reflect this market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the Data Engineer role at Samsara — building the data infrastructure for Industrial AGI is a rare and compelling challenge. My target total comp is $232K–$245K, based on my experience building [real-time/IoT/streaming] data pipelines at [Previous Company] processing [X billion events/day]. I have a competing offer from [Databricks/Snowflake] at $238K TC for a standard cloud data engineering role. Samsara's GAAP profitability means my infrastructure work drives real margin improvement, and the Super Bowl AI Coach launch proves data engineering here operates at the highest scale and reliability standards. I'd like a base of $172K, RSU grant of $135K/4yr, and a 10% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $212K TC. Let's align on numbers so I can start building the Industrial AGI data platform."
