**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Samsara are the technical bridge between the Industrial AGI platform and enterprise customers — designing deployment architectures for fleets, industrial sites, and logistics operations that span thousands of connected devices. With GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26, every customer deployment you architect contributes to a proven, profitable business model. The Super Bowl AI Coach launch exemplifies the kind of complex, high-visibility solutions you help customers adopt: AI coaching systems integrated into real-world fleet operations. You translate Industrial AGI capabilities into customer value.

**Level Mapping:**

- Samsara Solutions Architect = Google Customer Engineer L5 = AWS Solutions Architect = Azure Solutions Architect = Cisco Systems Engineer
- Samsara SAs have deeper technical involvement than cloud-only SA roles due to hardware/IoT integration requirements
- Strong path to Principal SA or Technical Director roles as Samsara's enterprise customer base expands

**GAAP Profitability — The Industrial AGI Architect Premium**

Solutions Architects at Samsara are the customer-facing Industrial AGI Architects — you design the real-world deployments that bring AI into fleets, warehouses, and job sites across the globe. GAAP profitability in Q3 FY26 is directly tied to your role: profitable customer expansions are driven by well-architected solutions that maximize product adoption and retention. This gives you concrete leverage — your work has a measurable impact on Samsara's revenue and profitability. Unlike SA roles at unprofitable companies where customer deployments may be loss leaders, every architecture you design at Samsara contributes to sustainable profit. The Super Bowl AI Coach — an AI coaching system for fleet drivers debuted during the Super Bowl — represents the consumer-grade AI experiences you help enterprise customers deploy at scale. As a Solutions Architect, you must understand IoT hardware, cloud AI, real-time data, and industrial workflows — a combination far more complex than standard SaaS solution design. Use GAAP profitability to argue that your customer-facing work directly drives the revenue that sustains profitability, and the Super Bowl AI Coach as proof that you help customers deploy globally visible AI solutions. Demand compensation reflecting both the technical complexity and the direct revenue impact of your role.

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue-Driving Architecture:** "As a Solutions Architect, my customer deployments directly drive revenue retention and expansion. Samsara's GAAP profitability proves this model works — I'd like comp reflecting my direct impact on the bottom line."
2. **IoT + AI Technical Depth:** "Architecting solutions that span IoT hardware, cloud AI, and industrial workflows is far more complex than standard SaaS. My experience with [fleet management/IoT deployment/industrial systems] uniquely qualifies me."
3. **Super Bowl AI Coach Deployments:** "The Super Bowl AI Coach is the kind of high-visibility solution I'd help customers adopt. I've deployed similarly complex AI systems at [Previous Company] — compensation should reflect that deployment expertise."
4. **Customer-Facing Technical Scarcity:** "Technical professionals who can credibly discuss AI architecture with CIOs AND deploy IoT hardware with fleet operators are rare. I'm comparing against SA offers from [AWS/Snowflake/Palo Alto Networks] at $250K+ TC."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the Solutions Architect role at Samsara — designing how Industrial AGI deploys into real-world operations is exactly my sweet spot. My target total comp is $242K–$258K, based on my experience architecting [IoT/AI/fleet] solutions at [Previous Company] and the market for SAs at GAAP-profitable AI platforms. I have a competing offer from [AWS/Snowflake] at $248K TC for a cloud-only SA role. Samsara's GAAP profitability means my customer deployments drive real margin, and the Super Bowl AI Coach proves these solutions have global impact. I'd like a base of $180K, RSU grant of $148K/4yr, and a 12% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $225K TC. Let's close on terms so I can start architecting Industrial AGI deployments."
