### Senior Software Engineer | Epic Systems Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Company / No Public Equity / Bonus-Only Variable / Senior IC Track

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Profit Sharing | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Verona WI | $135K–$185K | 10–12% | Variable | $150K–$210K |
| Remote (rare) | $125K–$175K | 10–12% | Variable | $140K–$200K |

**CRITICAL: Epic's Unique Compensation Structure**

Epic is privately held — **no RSUs, stock options, or public equity**. Total comp = base + bonus (10-12%) + discretionary profit sharing. At the senior level, the equity gap versus public companies becomes more pronounced — a Senior SWE at Oracle Health or Optum would receive $60K-$160K in RSUs/4yr on top of comparable base. **Push aggressively on base salary to partially close this gap.**

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Epic are the technical backbone of the EHR platform, leading feature development, mentoring junior developers, and making architectural decisions for modules that serve 300M+ patients. Senior engineers at Epic are valued for deep product knowledge — understanding how Epic's complex, interconnected modules (EpicCare, MyChart, Caboodle, Cogito, Healthy Planet) work together. The role requires not just strong engineering skills but deep understanding of clinical workflows: how physicians document encounters, how nurses manage medication administration, how labs report results. Senior engineers often own entire modules or sub-systems and represent the technical authority in conversations with healthcare system clients. Epic's promotion to senior is rigorous, based on demonstrated technical leadership and customer impact. [Source: Epic Systems Engineering Career Ladder 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Epic Senior Developer = Google L4 (but lower TC) = Cerner/Oracle Senior = Optum T4-T5 (lower TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Equity Gap Compensation:** "At the senior level, the equity gap is significant — I'd receive $60K-$160K in RSUs at Oracle Health, Optum, or other healthcare tech companies. I need the base at $180K+ to partially compensate for this structural comp disadvantage."
2. **Deep Platform Knowledge Value:** "Senior engineers at Epic don't just write code — they understand how Epic's interconnected modules serve clinical workflows. This institutional knowledge takes years to develop and is irreplaceable. The base should reflect this accumulated expertise."
3. **Client Impact Premium:** "As a senior engineer, I interact with Epic's hospital clients, representing the technical authority on platform capabilities. This client-facing responsibility — combined with technical leadership — justifies top-of-band compensation."
4. **Retention Economics:** "Epic's biggest risk at the senior level is losing engineers to public companies offering equity. A $15K-$20K base increase is far cheaper than the cost of replacing a senior engineer who takes their institutional knowledge to Oracle Health."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $180K with a 12% bonus target. The equity gap between Epic and public healthcare tech companies is largest at the senior level — the base needs to close that gap. My [EHR / clinical platform / healthcare software] experience makes me productive at Epic's senior level immediately." Epic will counter at $150K-$170K. Accept if base exceeds $160K. Push hard on base — it's your only meaningful lever.
