### Engineering Manager | Epic Systems Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Company / No Public Equity / Bonus-Only Variable / Team Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Profit Sharing | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Verona WI | $150K–$205K | 12–15% | Variable | $170K–$240K |
| Remote (rare) | $140K–$195K | 12–15% | Variable | $160K–$230K |

**CRITICAL: Epic's Unique Compensation Structure**

Epic is privately held — **no RSUs, stock options, or public equity**. Engineering Managers receive higher bonus percentages (12-15%) than ICs, plus discretionary profit sharing. At the EM level, the equity gap versus public companies is very significant — Oracle Health and Optum EMs receive $80K-$200K+ in RSUs/4yr.

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Epic (called "Team Leads" internally) lead development teams building modules of the EHR platform. Epic's management culture is distinctive: TLs are expected to remain technically hands-on while managing people, maintaining deep product knowledge, and serving as the interface between their team and hospital client needs. Epic's flat organizational structure means managers have broad scope but limited layers of hierarchy — a TL might own an entire product module with direct accountability for its quality, reliability, and client satisfaction. Epic values managers who combine technical authority with client empathy and team development. The company promotes from within heavily, so external EM hires must demonstrate both strong technical skills and the ability to earn credibility with long-tenured Epic engineers.

**Level Mapping:** Epic Team Lead = Google L5 EM (lower TC) = Cerner/Oracle EM = UHG EM (lower TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Base + Bonus Maximization:** "At the EM level, the equity gap is most painful — I'd receive $80K-$200K in RSUs at Oracle Health or Optum. I need the base at $200K+ and the bonus at 15% to make total cash comp competitive with public healthcare tech companies."
2. **Module Ownership Scope:** "As a Team Lead, I'll own an entire product module — not just a feature team. This P&L-equivalent scope at a module serving 300M+ patients justifies maximum compensation."
3. **Retention Value:** "Good EMs reduce team attrition by 30-50%. At Epic, where institutional knowledge is the most valuable asset, retaining engineers saves millions in training and ramp costs. My leadership investment has direct financial returns."
4. **Profit Sharing Transparency:** "I'd like to understand the profit sharing allocation for Team Leads vs individual contributors. For a private company, profit sharing is the closest proxy for equity participation, and TLs should receive a higher allocation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $200K with a 15% bonus target. The equity gap at the EM level is significant, and the base + bonus need to partially close it. My experience managing [team size] engineers delivering [healthcare software / EHR features] at [current company] means I can lead an Epic team effectively from day one." Epic will counter at $165K-$185K with 12% bonus. Accept if base exceeds $175K with 12%+ bonus. Push on both base and bonus percentage — EMs have slightly more bonus flexibility than ICs.
