### Staff Software Engineer | Epic Systems Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Company / No Public Equity / Bonus-Only Variable / Technical Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Profit Sharing | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Verona WI | $160K–$210K | 12–15% | Variable | $180K–$245K |
| Remote (rare) | $150K–$200K | 12–15% | Variable | $170K–$235K |

**CRITICAL: Epic's Unique Compensation Structure**

Epic is privately held — **no RSUs, stock options, or public equity**. At the Staff level, the equity gap versus public companies is the most pronounced — a Staff engineer at Google, Oracle Health, or Optum would receive $100K-$250K in RSUs/4yr. Epic compensates through higher base salary, elevated bonus percentages (12-15%), and profit sharing, but the gap remains significant. Staff engineers choosing Epic are making a deliberate tradeoff: cash stability and healthcare mission over equity upside.

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Epic represent the pinnacle of the IC technical career ladder. These engineers set architectural direction for entire product lines (EpicCare Ambulatory, EpicCare Inpatient, MyChart, Caboodle/Cogito analytics, Healthy Planet population health), lead cross-module technical initiatives, and serve as the final technical authority on platform decisions. Staff engineers at Epic have extraordinary institutional knowledge — understanding not just the codebase but the clinical workflows, regulatory requirements, and client deployment patterns that shape every architectural decision. Epic's Staff engineers often have 8-15+ years of tenure, and the company values this deep expertise above all. The role is rare — Epic promotes to Staff sparingly, and external hires at this level must demonstrate both exceptional technical skill and deep healthcare software understanding.

**Global Levers**

1. **Maximum Base Push:** "At the Staff level, the equity gap is $100K-$250K/4yr versus public companies. I need the base at $205K+ and the bonus at 15% to make the total cash comp competitive. I'm choosing Epic for the mission and platform — but the cash needs to be as strong as possible."
2. **Architectural Authority Value:** "Staff engineers at Epic set the technical direction for product lines serving 300M+ patients. My architectural decisions have downstream impact on every hospital running Epic. This authority-level compensation should be at the absolute top of Epic's bands."
3. **Irreplaceable Knowledge Premium:** "Staff engineers with deep Epic platform knowledge are essentially irreplaceable from external hiring. The cost of losing this institutional knowledge — and the impossibility of replicating it quickly — justifies maximum investment in retention comp."
4. **Profit Sharing Transparency:** "I'd like clarity on the profit sharing program — how it's calculated, historical payouts, and whether Staff engineers receive a higher allocation. For a private company, profit sharing is the closest analog to equity participation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with a 15% bonus target. At the Staff level, I'm foregoing $100K+ in annual equity value by choosing Epic over public companies. The base and bonus need to be at the absolute maximum to make this financially rational. My [X years] of healthcare platform experience and [specific architectural leadership] make me immediately effective at Epic's Staff level." Epic will counter at $170K-$190K with 12% bonus. Accept if base exceeds $185K with 12%+ bonus. Push hard on both base and bonus percentage — Staff is where Epic has the most flexibility.
