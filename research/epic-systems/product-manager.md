### Product Manager | Epic Systems Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Company / No Public Equity / Bonus-Only Variable / Clinical Product Strategy

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Profit Sharing | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Verona WI | $125K–$180K | 10–12% | Variable | $140K–$205K |
| Remote (rare) | $115K–$170K | 10–12% | Variable | $130K–$195K |

**CRITICAL: Epic's Unique Compensation Structure**

Epic is privately held — **no RSUs, stock options, or public equity**. Product Managers (called "Project Managers" or "Application Managers" internally at Epic) receive base + bonus (10-12%) + profit sharing. The PM title and function at Epic is different from traditional tech PM roles — PMs at Epic often interface directly with hospital clients and manage both product strategy and client implementation.

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Epic own the strategy, roadmap, and client relationships for EHR modules serving 300M+ patients. The role at Epic is uniquely client-facing: PMs travel to hospital sites, work directly with clinicians to understand workflow needs, and translate clinical requirements into product features. This is not an analytics-driven, A/B-testing PM role — it's a deep healthcare domain PM role where understanding clinical workflows, regulatory requirements, and hospital operations is essential. Epic's PM culture values deep product knowledge, long-term client relationships, and the ability to influence development priorities based on clinical evidence. PMs at Epic often have clinical or healthcare backgrounds alongside their product skills. The Verona campus culture emphasizes cross-functional collaboration between PMs and development teams.

**Level Mapping:** Epic Application Manager = Cerner/Oracle PM = UHG PM (lower TC due to no equity)

**Global Levers**

1. **Client-Revenue Relationship:** "As a PM at Epic, I manage direct relationships with hospital clients — each worth millions in annual contracts. Client satisfaction and retention directly correlate with PM effectiveness. My comp should reflect the client revenue I steward."
2. **Clinical Domain Expertise:** "I bring healthcare domain knowledge — clinical workflows, regulatory requirements, hospital operations — that general PMs spend 12-18 months learning. My background shortens the productivity ramp significantly."
3. **No-Equity Base Push:** "PMs at Oracle Health and Optum receive significant equity. Epic's base and bonus need to be at the top of band to compensate for the structural equity gap."
4. **Module Scope Impact:** "The EHR module I own is deployed across 2,800+ hospitals and affects millions of clinical workflows daily. This scale of product impact justifies maximum compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $175K with a 12% bonus. My healthcare product experience — specifically [clinical workflow / EHR / hospital operations] — means I can manage client relationships and drive product strategy from day one." Epic will counter at $140K-$165K with 10% bonus. Accept if base exceeds $155K. Push on base and bonus percentage.
