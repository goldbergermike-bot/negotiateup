### Software Engineer | Epic Systems Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Company / No Public Equity / Bonus-Only Variable / Unique Campus Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Profit Sharing | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Verona WI | $115K–$165K | 10% | Variable | $125K–$185K |
| Remote (rare) | $110K–$155K | 10% | Variable | $120K–$175K |

**CRITICAL: Epic's Unique Compensation Structure**

Epic Systems is privately held — **no RSUs, stock options, or public equity**. Total comp = base + annual bonus (typically 10%) + discretionary profit sharing. You cannot negotiate equity, so **base salary is your primary lever**. Epic's Verona WI campus offers unique benefits: sabbatical (4 weeks every 5 years), strong 401(k) match, on-campus amenities. The low Wisconsin cost of living partially offsets the equity gap.

**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Epic build the EHR platform that runs healthcare for 300M+ patients across 2,800+ hospitals. Epic's engineering culture is distinctive: the company uses M/MUMPS (Cache ObjectScript) for its core platform alongside modern web technologies for newer modules, emphasizes long tenure and deep product knowledge, and operates entirely from its Verona WI campus (with limited remote work). SWEs at Epic are called "Software Developers" internally and are expected to own features end-to-end — from database through business logic to UI. Epic recruits heavily from top universities, and the company's famous training program (called "Stars") is an intensive onboarding that builds deep product knowledge. While total comp is below Big Tech (due to no equity), the combination of meaningful healthcare impact, low cost of living, and stable cash compensation attracts engineers who prioritize mission over maximum comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **Base Salary Focus:** "Since Epic is private with no equity, my entire comp negotiation is base + bonus. I need the base at $160K+ to be competitive with what I'd earn at Oracle Health or Optum when including their equity components."
2. **National Talent Market Frame:** "Epic recruits nationally against companies that offer $200K+ TC with equity. While I value Epic's mission and culture, my base needs to reflect that I'm foregoing significant equity compensation."
3. **Healthcare Platform Expertise:** "I bring experience with healthcare software, clinical workflows, and HIPAA compliance. Epic's training program is excellent but takes months — my background shortens the ramp to productivity."
4. **Tenure Investment Argument:** "Epic values long-tenure engineers. A higher starting base retains talent longer — the cost of an engineer leaving after 18 months and going through Stars again far exceeds the $10K-$15K base increase I'm asking for."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $160K with a 10% bonus target. I understand Epic's private structure, but the base needs to partially compensate for equity I'd receive elsewhere. My [healthcare / clinical / platform] experience means faster productivity." Epic will counter at $130K-$150K. Accept if base exceeds $140K — that's strong purchasing power in Verona WI. Epic has very limited bonus flexibility; focus entirely on base.
