### Product Designer | Epic Systems Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Company / No Public Equity / Bonus-Only Variable / Clinical UX

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Profit Sharing | Total Comp |

**CRITICAL: Epic's Unique Compensation Structure**

Epic is privately held — **no RSUs, stock options, or public equity**. Design compensation at Epic is historically lower than engineering, following the broader industry pattern but amplified by the lack of equity.

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Epic (called "Human Interface Designers" or "User Experience Designers" internally) design the interfaces that clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and patients interact with every day. Epic's design work has life-or-death implications: medication interfaces must prevent dosing errors, alert designs must avoid alert fatigue, clinical workflows must minimize cognitive load for time-pressured providers. Epic's design organization has matured significantly, building a healthcare-specific design system and investing in usability research with actual clinicians. Designers at Epic have the rare opportunity to see their work used by millions of healthcare professionals across 2,800+ hospitals — the scale of clinical UX impact is unmatched. The Verona WI campus offers a unique design environment with an emphasis on creativity and user-centered thinking. [Source: Epic Human Interface Design 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Epic Designer = Cerner/Oracle Designer = UHG Designer (lower TC due to no equity)

**Global Levers**

1. **Clinical UX Impact:** "I'm designing interfaces where errors can harm patients. Medication dosing screens, clinical alerts, and care workflow interfaces require a level of precision and safety-consciousness that consumer UX doesn't demand. This clinical design expertise commands a premium."
2. **No-Equity Base Push:** "Designers at public healthcare tech companies receive $30K-$100K in equity. Epic's base needs to be at the top of band to compensate for the structural equity gap."
3. **Healthcare Design Portfolio:** "I bring healthcare UX experience — clinical workflow design, accessibility, and patient-safety-aware interface design. This domain expertise takes years to develop; my portfolio demonstrates it from day one."
4. **Scale of Impact:** "My designs will be used by millions of clinicians across 2,800+ hospitals. This scale of clinical UX impact justifies top-of-band compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $150K with a 10% bonus. My healthcare design experience — specifically [clinical UX / EHR design / patient-facing interfaces] — means I design safe, effective clinical interfaces from day one." Epic will counter at $120K-$140K. Accept if base exceeds $130K. Base is the only lever.
