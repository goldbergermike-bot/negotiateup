### Data Engineer | Epic Systems Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Company / No Public Equity / Bonus-Only Variable / Clinical Data Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Profit Sharing | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Verona WI | $120K–$170K | 10% | Variable | $130K–$190K |
| Remote (rare) | $110K–$160K | 10% | Variable | $120K–$180K |

**CRITICAL: Epic's Unique Compensation Structure**

Epic is privately held — **no RSUs, stock options, or public equity**. Total comp = base + bonus (10%) + discretionary profit sharing. Data engineers at Epic work on Caboodle (Epic's enterprise data warehouse), Cogito (analytics/reporting), and data integration pipelines that connect Epic to external systems via FHIR APIs and HL7 interfaces.

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Epic build the data infrastructure that makes clinical data actionable. Epic's data ecosystem includes Caboodle (an enterprise data warehouse that aggregates clinical, operational, and financial data), Cogito (the reporting and analytics layer), Cosmos (Epic's de-identified research database of 250M+ patient records), and FHIR-based interoperability APIs. Data engineers design ETL pipelines, optimize query performance, build data quality frameworks, and create the foundation that enables clinical research, population health analytics, and operational reporting across 2,800+ hospitals. Epic's data engineering is unique because the source data is clinical EHR data — requiring deep understanding of clinical data models, medical coding (ICD-10, CPT, SNOMED), and healthcare data standards (HL7 FHIR, CDA). The Cosmos dataset alone — 250M+ de-identified patient records — is one of the most valuable healthcare research datasets in the world. [Source: Epic Data Platform Architecture 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Epic Data Engineer = Cerner/Oracle DE = UHG DE (but lower TC due to no equity)

**Global Levers**

1. **Clinical Data Expertise:** "I bring healthcare data engineering experience — clinical data models, ICD-10/CPT coding, HL7 FHIR — that general data engineers lack. Epic can't train this domain expertise quickly; my background shortens the ramp by 6-12 months."
2. **Cosmos/Caboodle Strategic Value:** "Epic's data assets (Caboodle, Cosmos) are among the most valuable healthcare datasets in the world. I'm building the infrastructure that makes these assets queryable, reliable, and valuable. The strategic importance justifies top-of-band base salary."
3. **No-Equity Base Push:** "I'd receive $40K-$120K in RSUs at competing healthcare companies. Epic's base needs to be at the top of band to partially compensate for the structural equity gap."
4. **Interoperability Mandate:** "CMS interoperability rules mandate FHIR API access to patient data. Epic's data engineering team is building the infrastructure for regulatory compliance — this isn't optional work, it's mandatory, and the urgency premium should be reflected in comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $165K with a 10% bonus. My healthcare data engineering experience with [clinical data / FHIR / HL7] at [current company] means I can contribute to Caboodle/Cogito/Cosmos from month one." Epic will counter at $135K-$155K. Accept if base exceeds $145K. Focus entirely on base — bonus is essentially fixed at 10% for data engineers.
