### Technical Program Manager | Epic Systems Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Company / No Public Equity / Bonus-Only Variable / Implementation Program Execution

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Profit Sharing | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Verona WI | $130K–$185K | 10–12% | Variable | $145K–$210K |
| Remote (rare) | $120K–$175K | 10–12% | Variable | $135K–$200K |

**CRITICAL: Epic's Unique Compensation Structure**

Epic is privately held — **no RSUs, stock options, or public equity**. TPMs (often called "Implementation Managers" or "Project Directors" at Epic) receive base + bonus (10-12%) + profit sharing. The role is highly client-facing and involves travel.

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Epic manage complex, multi-year implementation and development programs spanning internal engineering teams and external hospital clients. Epic implementations are the most complex software deployments in healthcare — involving hundreds of clinical workflows, thousands of interfaces, data migration from legacy systems, clinician training programs, and go-live support. TPMs at Epic coordinate across development teams, quality assurance, implementation specialists, and hospital client stakeholders. The role requires deep technical fluency (understanding Epic's architecture and integration capabilities), healthcare domain knowledge (clinical workflows, regulatory requirements), and exceptional program management skills (managing dependencies across dozens of workstreams). Epic's TPMs are often the single point of accountability for multi-million dollar implementation programs. [Source: Epic Program Management 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Epic TPM/Implementation Director = Cerner/Oracle TPM = UHG TPM (lower TC due to no equity)

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Million Dollar Program Scope:** "Each Epic implementation I manage is a multi-million dollar, multi-year program. The financial stakes of successful execution — client revenue retention, implementation timeline, go-live success — justify top-of-band compensation."
2. **Client-Facing Accountability:** "As TPM, I'm the single point of accountability for hospital clients. Client satisfaction directly determines contract renewal and Epic's reputation in the market."
3. **No-Equity Base Push:** "TPMs at Oracle Health and Optum receive $55K-$145K in equity. Epic's base and bonus need to compensate for the structural gap."
4. **Healthcare Program Expertise:** "I bring experience managing complex healthcare technology programs — implementation timelines, clinical workflow dependencies, regulatory compliance. This domain expertise is immediately valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $180K with a 12% bonus. My healthcare program management experience — managing [implementation / platform / integration] programs at [current company] — means I can own Epic implementation programs from day one." Epic will counter at $145K-$170K with 10% bonus. Accept if base exceeds $160K. Push on base and bonus.
