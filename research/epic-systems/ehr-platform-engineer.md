### EHR Platform Engineer | Epic Systems Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Company / No Public Equity / Bonus-Only Variable / Unique Campus Culture | **SIGNATURE ROLE**

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Profit Sharing | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Verona WI | $130K–$180K | 10–12% | Variable | $145K–$205K |
| Remote (rare) | $120K–$170K | 10–12% | Variable | $135K–$195K |

**CRITICAL: Epic's Unique Compensation Structure**

Epic Systems is a privately held company — there are **no RSUs, stock options, or public equity** of any kind. Total compensation is base salary + annual bonus + profit sharing (discretionary). This fundamentally changes the negotiation: you cannot negotiate equity, so **100% of your negotiation energy goes into base salary and bonus percentage**. Epic also offers unique benefits: campus amenities in Verona WI, sabbatical program (4 weeks paid every 5 years), and strong 401(k) match. The lack of equity means Epic's total comp appears lower than public tech companies, but the stability of cash compensation (no stock volatility risk) and low Wisconsin cost of living partially offset this gap.

**Negotiation DNA**

Epic Systems dominates the Electronic Health Record (EHR) market with approximately 38% market share, serving over 300M patient records across 2,800+ hospitals and healthcare systems. The EHR Platform Engineer is Epic's core technical role — building and maintaining the platform that literally runs American healthcare. Epic's codebase is massive (written primarily in M/MUMPS and Cache/InterSystems, with newer components in web technologies), and the company's Verona WI campus culture is famously unique: whimsical themed buildings, on-campus amenities, and a culture that prizes institutional knowledge and long tenure. Epic is private by choice (founder Judy Faulkner has consistently rejected IPO/acquisition offers), which means compensation is entirely cash-based. Engineers here trade equity upside for the stability of working on mission-critical healthcare infrastructure with no stock market volatility.

**Level Mapping:** Epic Platform Engineer = Cerner/Oracle Senior = UHG Senior Engineer (but lower TC due to no equity)

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The EHR Platform Engineer at Epic builds the software that literally runs healthcare:
- **38% EHR Market Share:** More hospitals run Epic than any other EHR — your code touches 300M+ patient records
- **Mission-Critical Reliability:** Hospital systems cannot go down — uptime requirements exceed 99.99%
- **Decades-Long Codebase:** Epic's platform includes legacy M/MUMPS alongside modern web technologies — deep institutional knowledge is valued
- **Direct Patient Impact:** Every feature you build directly affects how clinicians care for patients — this is not abstract tech

**Global Levers**

1. **Market Dominance Frame:** "Epic controls 38% of the EHR market. The platform I'm building runs healthcare for 300M+ patients. This is mission-critical infrastructure at a scale no competitor matches — my base salary should reflect the criticality and market dominance of this platform."
2. **No-Equity Base Push:** "Since Epic is private with no equity compensation, my entire variable comp negotiation focuses on base salary and bonus. I need the base at the top of band to compensate for the equity component I'd receive at any public healthcare tech company."
3. **Cost-of-Living Advantage Reframe:** "While Verona WI has lower cost of living, Epic competes nationally for talent against companies in Seattle, SF, and NYC that offer equity. My comp should reflect the national market for healthcare platform engineers, not just Wisconsin rates."
4. **Institutional Knowledge Premium:** "Epic values long tenure and deep platform knowledge. Investing in a higher starting base for an engineer who will contribute for 5-10+ years is rational when the alternative is cycling through engineers at lower bases who leave after 2 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $175K with a 12% bonus target. Epic's private structure means base salary is the only meaningful lever — I need it to partially compensate for the equity I'd receive at Oracle Health, UHG, or Optum. My experience with [healthcare platforms / EHR systems / clinical workflow software] means I'm productive on Epic's platform from month one." Epic will counter at $145K-$165K base with a 10% bonus. Accept if base exceeds $155K — in Verona WI, that's strong purchasing power. Push hard on base; Epic has limited flexibility on bonus percentages.
