### DevOps Engineer | Epic Systems Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Company / No Public Equity / Bonus-Only Variable / Clinical Infrastructure Reliability

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Profit Sharing | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Verona WI | $120K–$170K | 10% | Variable | $130K–$190K |
| Remote (rare) | $110K–$160K | 10% | Variable | $120K–$180K |

**CRITICAL: Epic's Unique Compensation Structure**

Epic is privately held — **no RSUs, stock options, or public equity**. Total comp = base + bonus (10%) + discretionary profit sharing. DevOps/infrastructure engineers at Epic manage the build systems, deployment pipelines, and hosting infrastructure for the EHR platform that runs 2,800+ hospitals.

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Epic manage the infrastructure and deployment systems for the most widely deployed EHR in America. Epic's infrastructure story is unique: the company has historically deployed on-premises at customer data centers and also operates Epic Hosting (cloud-hosted Epic instances managed by Epic). DevOps engineers build and maintain CI/CD pipelines for Epic's massive codebase, manage container orchestration, automate deployment workflows, and ensure the infrastructure meets 99.99%+ uptime requirements — because EHR downtime literally means hospitals cannot care for patients. Epic is also investing in cloud infrastructure (Azure partnership) and modernizing its deployment architecture. The role requires understanding of HIPAA infrastructure requirements, healthcare data residency rules, and the unique challenges of deploying software to 2,800+ healthcare systems with different configurations.

**Level Mapping:** Epic DevOps Engineer = UHG DevOps (lower TC) = Cerner/Oracle DevOps (lower TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Clinical Uptime Criticality:** "EHR downtime means hospitals can't access patient records, process medications, or manage care. The infrastructure I maintain has direct patient safety implications — this criticality premium should be reflected in base salary."
2. **No-Equity Base Push:** "DevOps engineers at competing healthcare tech companies receive $40K-$130K in equity. Epic's base needs to be at the top of band to compensate."
3. **Healthcare Infrastructure Expertise:** "I bring HIPAA-compliant infrastructure management, healthcare data residency, and clinical system deployment experience. Epic can't train general DevOps engineers on healthcare infrastructure compliance quickly."
4. **Cloud Modernization Value:** "Epic is investing in cloud hosting and modern deployment architecture. DevOps engineers who can lead this cloud transformation bring forward-looking value beyond maintaining current systems."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $165K with a 10% bonus. My healthcare infrastructure experience with [HIPAA compliance / cloud hosting / deployment automation] at [current company] directly transfers to Epic's infrastructure needs." Epic will counter at $135K-$155K. Accept if base exceeds $145K. Base salary is the only lever — push hard.
