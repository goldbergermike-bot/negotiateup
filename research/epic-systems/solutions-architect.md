### Solutions Architect | Epic Systems Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Company / No Public Equity / Bonus-Only Variable / Healthcare Integration Architecture

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Profit Sharing | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Verona WI | $135K–$190K | 10–12% | Variable | $150K–$215K |

**CRITICAL: Epic's Unique Compensation Structure**

Epic is privately held — **no RSUs, stock options, or public equity**. Solutions Architects (often called "Integration Engineers" or "Technical Solutions" at Epic) receive base + bonus + profit sharing. The role is highly valued because Epic implementations are complex multi-year engagements.

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Epic design the technical architecture for EHR implementations and integrations across 2,800+ hospitals. The role bridges Epic's platform capabilities with each healthcare system's unique technical environment — designing interfaces (HL7, FHIR, X12 EDI), data migrations, integration architectures, and workflow configurations. Epic implementations are among the most complex software deployments in any industry — involving hundreds of clinical workflows, thousands of interfaces, and integration with lab systems, pharmacy systems, medical devices, billing systems, and regulatory reporting. Solutions Architects must understand both Epic's technical architecture and the clinical/operational workflows of hospitals. The role often involves client interaction and travel, designing solutions that account for each hospital's unique needs while leveraging Epic's platform capabilities.

**Level Mapping:** Epic Solutions Architect = Cerner/Oracle SA = UHG SA (lower TC due to no equity)

**Global Levers**

1. **Implementation Complexity Value:** "Epic implementations are among the most complex software deployments in any industry. My architecture decisions affect multi-year, multi-million dollar implementation projects. The base should reflect the financial stakes of these architectural decisions."
2. **Healthcare Interoperability Mastery:** "I bring deep HL7 FHIR, X12 EDI, and healthcare integration expertise. Epic's clients need architects who understand both the platform and the healthcare interoperability landscape."
3. **No-Equity Base Push:** "Solutions Architects at Oracle Health and Optum receive $55K-$160K in equity. Epic's base needs to be at the top of band to compensate for the structural gap."
4. **Client Relationship Revenue:** "Each hospital client represents millions in annual revenue. My architectural decisions directly impact implementation success, client satisfaction, and contract renewal. The revenue stewardship justifies premium comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $185K with a 12% bonus. My healthcare integration architecture experience — specifically [HL7 / FHIR / EHR implementation] — means I can lead Epic implementations from day one." Epic will counter at $150K-$175K with 10% bonus. Accept if base exceeds $165K. Push on base and bonus.
