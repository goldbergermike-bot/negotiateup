### ML/AI Engineer | Epic Systems Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Company / No Public Equity / Bonus-Only Variable | **+5-15% AI/ML PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Profit Sharing | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Verona WI | $130K–$180K | 10–12% | Variable | $145K–$205K |
| Remote (rare) | $120K–$170K | 10–12% | Variable | $135K–$195K |

**CRITICAL: Epic's Unique Compensation Structure**

Epic is privately held — **no RSUs, stock options, or public equity**. ML/AI engineers receive a modest premium over standard SWE bands (5-15%), but the gap versus public companies with AI premiums is significant. ML engineers choosing Epic are trading equity upside for the unique opportunity to deploy AI directly in clinical workflows.

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Epic build and deploy machine learning models directly into the EHR workflows that clinicians use at the point of care — a distinction that few other employers can offer. Epic's AI capabilities include sepsis prediction, patient deterioration alerts, readmission risk scoring, clinical documentation assistance (ambient listening/NLP), medication dosing recommendations, and operational forecasting (OR scheduling, bed management). The unique power of Epic's AI position is data access: models trained on 300M+ patient records through Cosmos and deployed across 2,800+ hospitals. Epic's clinical AI models must meet exceptionally high standards for accuracy, explainability, and safety — false positives in clinical AI create alert fatigue, and false negatives can miss life-threatening conditions. The role requires ML engineering skills combined with deep understanding of clinical workflow integration, model validation in healthcare settings, and FDA regulatory awareness for clinical AI.

**Level Mapping:** Epic ML Engineer = Tempus ML Engineer (lower TC) = Google L3-L4 ML (much lower TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Clinical AI Deployment Uniqueness:** "Very few companies can deploy AI directly into clinical workflows at the point of care. Epic's 300M+ patient dataset and 2,800+ hospital deployment footprint makes this one of the most impactful ML engineering roles in healthcare. The base should reflect this unique impact."
2. **AI Premium Request:** "ML/AI engineers command 10-20% premiums at public healthcare companies. Even within Epic's private structure, the AI premium should push the base above standard SWE bands — I'm asking for top of the ML band."
3. **Clinical AI Safety Expertise:** "Clinical AI requires rigorous validation, explainability, and safety standards that consumer AI doesn't. My experience with [clinical model validation / FDA regulatory AI / healthcare ML safety] eliminates the training ramp on clinical AI requirements."
4. **Cosmos Data Access Value:** "The opportunity to train models on 250M+ de-identified patient records (Cosmos) is unmatched. I'm choosing Epic partly for this data access — but the cash comp still needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $175K with a 12% bonus. My clinical ML experience — specifically [prediction models / NLP / clinical decision support] — means I can deploy production clinical AI at Epic from Q1. The AI premium should push this above standard SWE bands." Epic will counter at $145K-$165K with 10% bonus. Accept if base exceeds $155K. Push for the AI band differential explicitly.
