#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at SentinelOne

Security Engineers at SentinelOne are not defending internal infrastructure — they are building the detection and response capabilities that millions of enterprise endpoints depend on. Your threat research, detection rule authoring, reverse engineering, and vulnerability analysis directly feed the Singularity platform's detection engine and Purple AI's threat intelligence layer. When a new zero-day exploit emerges, your response time and detection quality determine whether SentinelOne's customers are protected or exposed. Purple AI's 40% attach rate among new customers is powered by the detection intelligence that security engineers create.

The Autonomous Defense vision requires security engineers who can translate threat landscape expertise into automated detection and response capabilities. The goal is not just to detect threats — it is to detect, investigate, and remediate them autonomously, without human analyst intervention. Security engineers who can codify their expertise into the Singularity platform's AI-driven response engine are building the core competitive advantage that drives SentinelOne toward sustained profitability.

SentinelOne's Tel Aviv office is a major hub for security research talent, leveraging Israel's deep cybersecurity ecosystem. Security engineers with backgrounds in military cyber units (Unit 8200, etc.) and Israeli security startups bring threat intelligence expertise that is difficult to replicate. This talent pool — combined with Mountain View's AI/ML engineering strength and London's enterprise security market proximity — creates a global security engineering capability that is uniquely positioned.

### 🟣 SentinelOne Purple AI & Autonomous Defense Lever

Purple AI's intelligence is only as good as the threat detection foundation that security engineers build. The 40% attach rate among new customers reflects the underlying detection quality — when Purple AI analyzes a threat, it draws on detection rules, behavioral models, and threat intelligence that security engineers have authored and validated. Your domain expertise is the raw material that makes Purple AI valuable.

The Autonomous Defense vision is fundamentally a security engineering challenge. Autonomous threat response requires security engineers who can define response playbooks, calibrate detection confidence scores, and build the threat taxonomies that enable AI systems to make remediation decisions without human oversight. This is where deep security expertise meets AI-driven automation on the Singularity platform.

Security engineers who can operate at this intersection — combining offensive security knowledge with defensive AI engineering — are among the rarest and most sought-after professionals in the cybersecurity industry. CrowdStrike, Google Mandiant, Microsoft, and nation-state intelligence agencies all compete for this talent pool, giving you extraordinary negotiation leverage.

Use this language: "Purple AI's 40% attach rate is accelerating SentinelOne toward sustained profitability. I negotiate as an Autonomous Defense security expert who powers the intelligence layer of the AI-driven Singularity platform. My threat research and detection engineering directly determine the platform's efficacy and customer trust."

#### Global Lever 1: Singularity Data Lake & XDR

Security engineers who build cross-surface detection rules for the Singularity Data Lake and XDR platform create the correlation intelligence that differentiates SentinelOne from single-surface competitors. Your ability to detect multi-stage attacks that span endpoint, cloud, and identity surfaces is what makes the XDR vision real.

**Negotiation language**: "My cross-surface detection engineering on the Singularity Data Lake powers XDR capabilities that competitors cannot replicate. Every correlation rule I build increases the platform's value and drives customer adoption of premium analytics tiers."

#### Global Lever 2: Purple AI Generative Security

Security engineers provide the domain expertise that makes Purple AI accurate and trustworthy. Your threat intelligence, detection rule authoring, and investigation methodology become the training data and validation criteria that ensure Purple AI's 40% attach rate translates into genuine security value — not just a compelling demo.

**Negotiation language**: "My security research directly powers Purple AI's intelligence layer. The 40% attach rate is sustained because my detection engineering ensures that Purple AI's recommendations are accurate, actionable, and trustworthy in real-world threat scenarios on the Singularity platform."

#### Global Lever 3: Cloud Workload Security

Cloud security engineering requires understanding cloud-native attack vectors: container escapes, Kubernetes misconfigurations, serverless injection, and cloud credential abuse. Security engineers who can build detection capabilities for these environments expand SentinelOne's protection surface into the fastest-growing segment of enterprise IT.

**Negotiation language**: "My cloud threat research and detection engineering directly enable Singularity Cloud's protection capabilities. I build the detection rules that differentiate SentinelOne's runtime cloud workload protection from competitors who rely on posture management alone."

#### Global Lever 4: Path to Profitability Premium

Security engineers impact profitability through detection quality — better detections mean fewer false positives (reducing support costs), higher customer confidence (improving retention), and premium positioning (enabling higher pricing). Every improvement in detection efficacy directly strengthens the financial metrics that drive sustained profitability.

**Negotiation language**: "My detection engineering directly drives SentinelOne's path to sustained profitability by improving detection efficacy, reducing false positives, and strengthening customer confidence in the Singularity platform. Better security outcomes mean better unit economics."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $225,000 base with 11,000 RSUs ($330,000 at current S price ~$30). Your accept-at floor should be $420,000 total comp (base + annualized RSU + bonus). Cite Purple AI's 40% attach rate, the path to sustained profitability, and your ability to power the Autonomous Defense detection engine on the Singularity platform. For Tel Aviv roles, open at ₪620,000 base; for London, open at £120,000 base.
