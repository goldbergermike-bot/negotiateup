|-------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $175,000–$220,000 | ₪450,000–₪580,000 | £85,000–£110,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $225,000–$290,000 | ₪580,000–₪760,000 | £115,000–£150,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $285,000–$380,000 | ₪720,000–₪1,000,000 | £145,000–£190,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest, NYSE: S), and performance bonus. RSU refresh grants are awarded annually based on team performance and delivery.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at SentinelOne

Engineering Managers at SentinelOne are not just people managers — they are delivery leaders who own the velocity, quality, and strategic direction of teams building the Singularity platform. Purple AI's 40% attach rate among new customers has created urgency to scale engineering output across every product surface, and EMs are the force multipliers who make this scaling possible without sacrificing code quality or team health.

SentinelOne's Autonomous Defense vision requires coordinated execution across kernel agents, cloud detection engines, data pipelines, and AI inference systems. Engineering Managers orchestrate this coordination, breaking down the vision into quarterly deliverables and ensuring their teams ship on time. Your ability to recruit, retain, and develop senior engineers in a hyper-competitive market directly impacts SentinelOne's product velocity and, ultimately, its path to sustained profitability.

The company's growth trajectory demands EMs who can build teams from scratch in new product areas while maintaining delivery cadence in mature ones. Whether you are scaling a Purple AI feature team in Mountain View, building a Singularity Cloud team in Tel Aviv, or standing up a Data Lake engineering group in London, your organizational design decisions determine SentinelOne's engineering throughput.

#### SentinelOne Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | S1 Internal Level | Typical YOE |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Engineering Manager | M1 (EM) | 6-10 years |
| Senior Engineering Manager | M2 (Senior EM) | 10-14 years |
| Director of Engineering | M3 (Director) | 12-16 years |
| VP of Engineering | M4 (VP) | 16+ years |

### 🟣 SentinelOne Purple AI & Autonomous Defense Lever

Purple AI's 40% attach rate is not just a product metric — it is a signal that SentinelOne needs to scale engineering capacity rapidly to meet customer demand. As an Engineering Manager, you are the person responsible for this scaling. You hire the engineers, design the team structures, and set the delivery cadences that determine whether SentinelOne can convert Purple AI demand into shipped features and revenue.

The Autonomous Defense vision requires unprecedented coordination between teams. Endpoint agents must feed telemetry to the Singularity Data Lake, which must process it for Purple AI's inference layer, which must generate actionable intelligence for the automated response engine. Engineering Managers who can orchestrate this cross-team execution while maintaining team autonomy are exceptionally valuable — and exceptionally rare.

SentinelOne's path to sustained profitability depends on engineering efficiency, which is directly your responsibility. Every process improvement, every smart hiring decision, every architecture review you facilitate that prevents a costly rearchitecture — all of these compound into the operating leverage that analysts track quarter over quarter.

Use this language: "Purple AI's 40% attach rate is accelerating SentinelOne toward sustained profitability. I negotiate as an Autonomous Defense delivery leader who scales teams on the AI-driven Singularity platform. My engineering management directly translates product vision into shipped capabilities."

#### Global Lever 1: Singularity Data Lake & XDR

Engineering Managers who lead Singularity Data Lake teams own one of SentinelOne's most strategically important and technically challenging product surfaces. The Data Lake powers every downstream feature — from XDR correlation to Purple AI inference — and managing the engineering team that builds it requires deep technical judgment combined with organizational leadership.

**Negotiation language**: "I lead the engineering team behind the Singularity Data Lake, which is the foundational infrastructure for every product SentinelOne sells. My team's velocity directly determines the pace of innovation across the entire platform."

#### Global Lever 2: Purple AI Generative Security

Managing a Purple AI engineering team means navigating the fastest-moving area of technology (LLMs) within one of the fastest-moving markets (cybersecurity). The 40% attach rate creates constant pressure to ship new capabilities, and the EM must balance speed with reliability in a domain where incorrect AI outputs could have real-world security consequences.

**Negotiation language**: "Purple AI's 40% attach rate means my team operates at the highest-urgency intersection in the company. I manage the delivery of SentinelOne's most important growth engine while maintaining the quality standards that enterprise security customers demand."

#### Global Lever 3: Cloud Workload Security

Building a Singularity Cloud engineering team requires recruiting engineers with rare cloud-native security expertise. EMs who can attract and retain this talent pool — competing against AWS, Google, and dedicated cloud security startups — provide outsized organizational value.

**Negotiation language**: "Singularity Cloud is SentinelOne's largest TAM expansion vector. My ability to recruit and retain cloud-security engineers in the most competitive talent market directly determines the pace of market capture."

#### Global Lever 4: Path to Profitability Premium

Engineering Managers are directly accountable for engineering efficiency metrics — velocity per engineer, infrastructure cost per feature, and time-to-production. These metrics are the building blocks of the operating leverage that drives SentinelOne toward sustained profitability.

**Negotiation language**: "My engineering management directly improves operating leverage by increasing delivery velocity without proportional headcount growth. This efficiency is the engine behind SentinelOne's path to sustained profitability, and my compensation should reflect this impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $260,000 base with 15,000 RSUs ($450,000 at current S price ~$30). Your accept-at floor should be $480,000 total comp (base + annualized RSU + bonus). Cite Purple AI's 40% attach rate, the path to sustained profitability, and your ability to build and lead Autonomous Defense engineering teams on the Singularity platform. For Tel Aviv roles, open at ₪680,000 base; for London, open at £135,000 base.
