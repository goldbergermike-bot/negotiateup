#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at SentinelOne

Solutions Architects at SentinelOne are the technical face of the company in enterprise sales cycles. You design deployment architectures, lead proof-of-concept evaluations, and translate complex customer security requirements into Singularity platform solutions. Purple AI's 40% attach rate among new customers is partially driven by SAs who demonstrate the generative AI security analyst capabilities in live customer environments — turning skepticism into signed contracts.

The Autonomous Defense vision is only as compelling as the SA's ability to articulate it technically. When an enterprise CISO asks "How will SentinelOne replace my SOC analysts?", the SA is the person who maps that vision to specific Singularity platform capabilities, deployment timelines, and ROI projections. This consultative technical selling directly drives deal sizes, close rates, and customer expansion — all metrics that impact SentinelOne's path to sustained profitability.

SAs at SentinelOne operate across the full platform surface: endpoint protection, cloud workload security, identity threat detection, Singularity Data Lake analytics, and Purple AI. This breadth makes them among the most technically versatile members of the organization, and replacing a ramped SA with deep customer relationships and platform expertise takes 6-12 months.

#### SentinelOne Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | S1 Internal Level | Typical YOE |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Solutions Architect | SA3 (SA I) | 3-6 years |
| Senior Solutions Architect | SA4 (Senior SA) | 6-10 years |

### 🟣 SentinelOne Purple AI & Autonomous Defense Lever

Purple AI is the most powerful demo asset in the SA toolkit. When you walk into a customer evaluation and show a security analyst using natural language to investigate a complex multi-stage attack — with Purple AI correlating data from endpoints, cloud workloads, and identity systems through the Singularity platform — the competitive differentiation is immediately visible. The 40% attach rate among new customers reflects the cumulative impact of thousands of these demonstrations by SAs worldwide.

The Autonomous Defense vision is what SAs sell at the strategic level. Beyond individual product capabilities, SAs articulate a future where SentinelOne's AI agents handle the full threat lifecycle autonomously, freeing security teams to focus on strategic risk management. This vision-selling creates larger deal sizes, multi-year contracts, and executive-level relationships that drive sustained profitability through customer expansion.

SAs who can effectively demonstrate Purple AI and articulate the Autonomous Defense roadmap are directly responsible for revenue acceleration. Every proof-of-concept won, every competitive displacement achieved, and every customer expanded is quantifiable evidence of your impact on the Singularity platform's market penetration.

Use this language: "Purple AI's 40% attach rate is accelerating SentinelOne toward sustained profitability. I negotiate as an Autonomous Defense solutions architect who translates the AI-driven Singularity platform into enterprise deployments and revenue. My technical selling directly drives deal sizes and close rates."

#### Global Lever 1: Singularity Data Lake & XDR

SAs who can design Singularity Data Lake architectures for enterprise customers drive significant ARPU expansion. The Data Lake transforms SentinelOne from a point product into a security analytics platform, and SAs who can articulate this value proposition during sales cycles command premium compensation.

**Negotiation language**: "My Singularity Data Lake solution designs drive ARPU expansion by positioning SentinelOne as an enterprise security analytics platform, not just an endpoint product. Every Data Lake deployment I architect increases customer lifetime value."

#### Global Lever 2: Purple AI Generative Security

SAs are the front line of Purple AI adoption. Your ability to demonstrate Purple AI's capabilities in customer-specific contexts — using their threat data, their investigation workflows, their analyst personas — directly drives the 40% attach rate higher and accelerates revenue from the premium AI tier.

**Negotiation language**: "I am on the front line of Purple AI adoption, demonstrating generative AI security capabilities that drive the 40% attach rate. My technical demonstrations directly convert prospects into Purple AI customers and expand existing accounts on the Singularity platform."

#### Global Lever 3: Cloud Workload Security

Enterprise customers evaluating Singularity Cloud need SAs who can design deployment architectures for complex multi-cloud environments. This requires deep expertise in AWS, Azure, GCP, container orchestration, and cloud-native security patterns — a rare combination that commands premium compensation.

**Negotiation language**: "My multi-cloud architecture expertise directly enables Singularity Cloud sales. I design deployment architectures that address enterprise-grade cloud security requirements and differentiate SentinelOne from cloud-native security point products."

#### Global Lever 4: Path to Profitability Premium

SAs directly impact profitability through deal velocity (shorter sales cycles reduce cost of acquisition), deal size (comprehensive platform deployments versus point product sales), and customer retention (well-architected deployments reduce churn and support costs).

**Negotiation language**: "My solution architectures drive SentinelOne's path to sustained profitability by increasing deal sizes, shortening sales cycles, and designing deployments that minimize churn. Every well-architected customer deployment contributes to the unit economics that drive profitability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $225,000 base with 10,000 RSUs ($300,000 at current S price ~$30). Your accept-at floor should be $400,000 total comp (base + annualized RSU + bonus + variable). Cite Purple AI's 40% attach rate, the path to sustained profitability, and your ability to deploy Autonomous Defense solutions on the Singularity platform. For Tel Aviv roles, open at ₪600,000 base; for London, open at £115,000 base.
