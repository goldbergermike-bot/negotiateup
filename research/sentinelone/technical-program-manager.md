#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at SentinelOne

Technical Program Managers at SentinelOne coordinate delivery across the most complex cross-functional programs in cybersecurity. The Singularity platform spans endpoint agents (kernel-level software deployed on millions of machines), cloud detection engines, the Singularity Data Lake, identity threat detection, and the Purple AI inference layer — and TPMs are the connective tissue that ensures all of these systems ship coherently. Purple AI's 40% attach rate among new customers was only possible because TPMs coordinated the integration of LLM capabilities across multiple engineering teams, data pipelines, and product surfaces.

The Autonomous Defense vision requires multi-quarter program execution that spans engineering, product, design, security research, and go-to-market teams. TPMs who can manage this complexity while maintaining delivery velocity are exceptionally valuable at SentinelOne, where the competitive landscape demands rapid innovation. Your program management directly impacts the pace at which SentinelOne can ship differentiated capabilities and accelerate its path to sustained profitability.

SentinelOne operates engineering centers in Mountain View, Tel Aviv, and other global locations, which adds time zone coordination and cultural complexity to program execution. TPMs who can effectively manage distributed teams across these offices — particularly for programs that touch the Singularity platform core — command premium compensation because this coordination skill is rare and essential.

### 🟣 SentinelOne Purple AI & Autonomous Defense Lever

Purple AI's launch was one of the most complex cross-functional programs in SentinelOne's history, requiring coordination between AI/ML engineers, platform teams, security researchers, product managers, and go-to-market teams. The 40% attach rate among new customers is a program management success story as much as a product success story — TPMs ensured that the AI capabilities shipped with the integration depth, reliability, and documentation needed for rapid enterprise adoption on the Singularity platform.

The Autonomous Defense roadmap requires TPMs who can manage multi-quarter programs with deep technical dependencies. Building autonomous threat detection, investigation, and response capabilities means coordinating work across the kernel agent team, the cloud detection team, the Data Lake team, and the Purple AI inference team — all while managing dependencies, risks, and quality gates. TPMs who can navigate this complexity are directly responsible for SentinelOne's innovation velocity.

SentinelOne's path to sustained profitability depends on shipping the right features at the right time to drive revenue growth and operational efficiency. TPMs who can prioritize program investments, manage scope effectively, and ensure on-time delivery of revenue-critical features directly impact the financial trajectory that drives stock price appreciation and RSU value.

Use this language: "Purple AI's 40% attach rate is accelerating SentinelOne toward sustained profitability. I negotiate as an Autonomous Defense program leader who ensures the AI-driven Singularity platform ships on time and at quality. My program management directly drives innovation velocity and revenue realization."

#### Global Lever 1: Singularity Data Lake & XDR

TPMs who manage Singularity Data Lake and XDR programs coordinate across data engineering, platform, and product teams to deliver unified security analytics capabilities. These programs directly impact customer retention and platform stickiness, making them among the highest-priority deliverables in the company.

**Negotiation language**: "I manage the cross-functional delivery of Singularity Data Lake and XDR programs that directly drive customer retention and platform adoption. My program execution ensures SentinelOne ships unified analytics capabilities that competitors cannot match."

#### Global Lever 2: Purple AI Generative Security

Managing the Purple AI program requires navigating the unique challenges of shipping AI/ML products — model performance unpredictability, safety and accuracy requirements, and the need to coordinate between research-oriented ML teams and production-focused engineering teams. The 40% attach rate reflects the TPM's success in managing these challenges.

**Negotiation language**: "I manage the Purple AI program that has achieved a 40% attach rate — the most successful product launch in SentinelOne history. My ability to coordinate AI/ML research, platform engineering, and go-to-market execution ensures Purple AI continues to accelerate revenue growth on the Singularity platform."

#### Global Lever 3: Cloud Workload Security

Singularity Cloud programs require coordinating with cloud provider partner teams (AWS, Azure, GCP), managing multi-cloud certification processes, and ensuring deployment automation works across heterogeneous customer environments. This adds external dependency management complexity that few TPMs have experience with.

**Negotiation language**: "I manage Singularity Cloud programs that require coordination with cloud provider partners and multi-cloud deployment certification. My external partner management and cross-functional execution directly accelerate SentinelOne's cloud security market capture."

#### Global Lever 4: Path to Profitability Premium

TPMs impact profitability by ensuring efficient resource allocation, preventing scope creep on expensive programs, and maintaining delivery velocity that enables SentinelOne to capture market windows before competitors. Every on-time delivery reduces waste and accelerates revenue realization.

**Negotiation language**: "My program management directly drives SentinelOne's path to sustained profitability by ensuring efficient resource allocation, on-time delivery, and scope discipline across the Singularity platform. Every program I deliver on time accelerates revenue realization and improves operating leverage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $210,000 base with 9,000 RSUs ($270,000 at current S price ~$30). Your accept-at floor should be $370,000 total comp (base + annualized RSU + bonus). Cite Purple AI's 40% attach rate, the path to sustained profitability, and your ability to drive Autonomous Defense program delivery across the Singularity platform. For Tel Aviv roles, open at ₪550,000 base; for London, open at £105,000 base.
