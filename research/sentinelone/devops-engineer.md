#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at SentinelOne

DevOps Engineers at SentinelOne are not running standard web application infrastructure — they are operating the deployment and reliability systems for a cybersecurity platform that protects millions of endpoints in real time. The Singularity platform must maintain sub-second response times for threat detection and remediation, and any infrastructure failure directly impacts customer security posture. Purple AI's 40% attach rate among new customers adds enormous infrastructure pressure: every new Purple AI customer generates inference workloads that must be served with consistent low latency at global scale.

SentinelOne's Autonomous Defense vision demands infrastructure that can autonomously scale, self-heal, and operate across multiple cloud regions and data centers without human intervention. DevOps engineers who can build this level of automation directly reduce operational costs and accelerate the path to sustained profitability by improving infrastructure efficiency without proportional headcount growth.

The Singularity platform spans endpoint agents deployed on customer machines, cloud-hosted detection engines, the Singularity Data Lake for security analytics, and the Purple AI inference layer. DevOps engineers must orchestrate deployments across all of these surfaces while maintaining backward compatibility with millions of installed agents. This complexity — combined with the security-critical nature of the work — commands premium compensation.

### 🟣 SentinelOne Purple AI & Autonomous Defense Lever

Purple AI's 40% attach rate has created a massive infrastructure scaling challenge. Every Purple AI query triggers LLM inference workloads that require GPU compute, context retrieval from the Singularity Data Lake, and real-time threat correlation across multiple data sources. DevOps engineers who can build the infrastructure to serve these workloads cost-efficiently are directly enabling SentinelOne's most important growth engine and accelerating the path to sustained profitability.

The Autonomous Defense vision extends to infrastructure itself. SentinelOne's platform must be self-healing, auto-scaling, and capable of deploying updates to millions of endpoint agents without disruption. DevOps engineers who can automate these operations are building the infrastructure equivalent of autonomous defense — systems that protect themselves without human intervention.

Use this language: "Purple AI's 40% attach rate is accelerating SentinelOne toward sustained profitability. I negotiate as an Autonomous Defense infrastructure architect who ensures the AI-driven Singularity platform operates at global scale with zero downtime. My DevOps work directly reduces infrastructure costs and improves deployment velocity."

The market for DevOps engineers with security platform experience is extremely tight. Operating infrastructure where a deployment failure could leave enterprises unprotected creates unique operational discipline requirements that most DevOps engineers have never encountered. This specialization commands a premium.

#### Global Lever 1: Singularity Data Lake & XDR

The Singularity Data Lake's infrastructure requirements are massive — petabytes of security telemetry ingested daily, sub-second query latency requirements, and multi-region replication for data sovereignty compliance. DevOps engineers who can optimize this infrastructure directly impact SentinelOne's gross margins.

**Negotiation language**: "My infrastructure optimization work on the Singularity Data Lake directly improves gross margins by reducing per-terabyte storage and compute costs. Every efficiency I deliver flows straight to the bottom line and accelerates profitability."

#### Global Lever 2: Purple AI Generative Security

Purple AI requires GPU infrastructure management, LLM serving optimization, and real-time inference pipeline orchestration. The 40% attach rate means inference demand is growing rapidly, and DevOps engineers must scale this infrastructure while maintaining cost efficiency and latency targets.

**Negotiation language**: "I build and operate the inference infrastructure that serves Purple AI's 40% attach rate. My ability to scale GPU compute efficiently while maintaining sub-second latency directly determines whether Purple AI can grow from a premium feature to a ubiquitous capability on the Singularity platform."

#### Global Lever 3: Cloud Workload Security

Singularity Cloud requires deploying and managing security agents across customer cloud environments — AWS, Azure, and GCP — each with unique infrastructure patterns. DevOps engineers who can automate cross-cloud deployment and monitoring are essential to scaling this product surface.

**Negotiation language**: "I automate the deployment and management of Singularity Cloud agents across multi-cloud environments. My infrastructure automation directly enables SentinelOne to scale cloud workload protection without proportional operational headcount growth."

#### Global Lever 4: Path to Profitability Premium

DevOps engineers are the primary drivers of infrastructure cost optimization — the largest variable cost in SentinelOne's P&L after personnel. Every dollar saved in compute, storage, and bandwidth flows directly to gross margin improvement and accelerates the path to sustained profitability.

**Negotiation language**: "My infrastructure cost optimization work directly accelerates SentinelOne's path to sustained profitability. I drive gross margin improvement by reducing per-customer infrastructure costs while maintaining the reliability and performance that enterprise customers demand."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $200,000 base with 9,000 RSUs ($270,000 at current S price ~$30). Your accept-at floor should be $360,000 total comp (base + annualized RSU + bonus). Cite Purple AI's 40% attach rate, the path to sustained profitability, and your ability to architect Autonomous Defense infrastructure on the Singularity platform. For Tel Aviv roles, open at ₪530,000 base; for London, open at £100,000 base.
