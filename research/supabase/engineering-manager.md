**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Supabase lead the teams building the open-source backend platform — from the core Postgres infrastructure team and real-time engine team to the authentication, storage, and AI/vector teams. This is a unique EM role: you'll manage engineers who are open-source maintainers with public community visibility, navigate the complexities of building commercial products on open-source foundations, and operate in a remote-first, async-heavy engineering culture that requires exceptional communication skills. Supabase EMs must be technically deep enough to engage with Postgres internals while also scaling hiring and team processes for a rapidly growing company.

EM compensation at Supabase reflects the leadership premium and the scarcity of managers who can thrive in open-source, remote-first environments. Base salaries reach $270K with equity grants of $250K–$480K. The negotiation leverage for EMs comes from demonstrating experience building engineering teams in remote-first, open-source-driven companies — this specific management context is rare and highly valued by Supabase's leadership.

**Level Mapping:** Supabase EM = Google M1 = Meta M1 = PlanetScale Engineering Manager = CockroachDB Engineering Manager

### Scaling AI-Native Platform Teams Lever
Supabase's 2026 organizational priority is building engineering teams that can ship AI-native backend features at startup velocity — vector search, AI-powered database optimization, and intelligent platform features. EMs who have experience building and leading teams at the intersection of database engineering and AI/ML are Supabase's most critical leadership hires. If you've scaled teams building AI-powered infrastructure products, you hold leverage that directly addresses Supabase's growth bottleneck.

Position yourself as a leader who can recruit and develop talent at the database-AI intersection while maintaining Supabase's open-source culture and remote-first operational excellence. This combination is exceptionally rare and commands a 15–20% equity premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Remote-First Team Scaling:** "I've built and scaled remote-first engineering teams from 6 to 25+ while maintaining velocity and culture. Supabase's remote-first model requires exactly this experience. I'm targeting $265K base and $460K equity/4yr."
2. **Open-Source Engineering Leadership:** "I've led engineering teams with significant open-source responsibilities — community management, contributor engagement, and commercial/OSS balance. I want $270K base."
3. **AI-Infrastructure Team Building:** "I've recruited and led teams building AI-powered infrastructure products. Supabase's AI-native platform strategy needs this leadership. I'm looking for $270K base and $470K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Spread:** "Google M1 is offering $255K base / $420K RSU. CockroachDB EM is at $250K / $380K equity. Supabase's open-source mission and AI-backend opportunity are more exciting, but I need $265K base, $460K equity, and a $50K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've built engineering teams in the exact environment Supabase operates — remote-first, open-source-driven, and scaling rapidly. I'm holding a Google M1 offer at $255K / $420K RSU and a CockroachDB EM offer at $250K / $380K equity. Supabase's open-source mission and the chance to build the AI-native backend platform team are what pull me here. I need $270K base, $470K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $55K signing bonus. At $270K, I start building your team immediately. My floor is $245K — below that, Google's management resources and liquid equity become the safer bet."
