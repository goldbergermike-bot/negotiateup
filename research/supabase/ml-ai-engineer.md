**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Supabase build the intelligence layer that makes Postgres AI-native — from pgvector optimization and embedding pipeline infrastructure to AI-powered query optimization, semantic caching, and intelligent database management features. This is a uniquely impactful ML engineering role: your models and systems ship as core platform capabilities that thousands of developers use to build AI applications on top of Supabase. You're not building ML models in isolation; you're embedding AI capabilities into the world's most popular open-source database platform alternative.

Supabase's ML/AI Engineer compensation reflects the extreme market premium for AI talent combined with the company's pre-IPO equity upside. Base salaries reach $250K to compete with dedicated AI companies and Big Tech ML teams, and equity grants of $180K–$370K provide meaningful ownership. The negotiation dynamic is highly favorable for AI engineers: Supabase is building its AI/vector capabilities from a position of platform strength (millions of developers already use Supabase), so ML engineers who can accelerate this initiative are the company's highest-priority technical hires.

**Level Mapping:** Supabase ML/AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta E4-E5 ML Engineer = Pinecone ML Engineer = Weaviate ML Engineer

### Postgres-Native AI & Vector Intelligence Lever
Supabase's 2026 AI strategy is making Postgres the best database for AI applications — pgvector at enterprise scale, AI-powered query optimization, semantic search primitives, and RAG infrastructure built directly into the Supabase platform. ML/AI Engineers working on these capabilities are building the features that differentiate Supabase from every other backend platform. If you bring vector database expertise, embedding model optimization experience, or Postgres extension development skills alongside ML engineering, you're targeting Supabase's highest-investment area.

Frame your negotiation around the vector-database AI premium: the intersection of ML engineering and database systems is one of the most in-demand specialties in 2026, and Supabase needs engineers who can make pgvector competitive with dedicated vector databases like Pinecone while maintaining Postgres's reliability guarantees.

**Global Levers**
1. **Vector Database Engineering:** "I've built and optimized vector search systems — ANN algorithms, embedding indexing, and similarity search at scale. This is the core technology Supabase needs to make pgvector world-class. I'm targeting $245K base and $355K equity/4yr."
2. **Postgres-ML Integration:** "I've built ML features within Postgres — custom extensions, in-database inference, and ML-powered query optimization. This exact intersection is Supabase's AI differentiation. I want $250K base."
3. **AI Infrastructure at Scale:** "I've designed AI infrastructure serving millions of users — embedding pipelines, model serving, and vector operations at production scale. Supabase needs this to serve its developer base. I'm looking for $250K base and $365K equity/4yr."
4. **AI Company Competing Offers:** "Pinecone is offering $240K base / $320K equity. Weaviate is at $235K / $300K equity. Supabase's broader platform (not just vectors — full backend) and massive existing developer base make the AI opportunity larger. I need $245K base and $360K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've built my career at the intersection of ML engineering and database systems — vector search, embedding infrastructure, and AI-powered data platforms. Supabase's opportunity is uniquely compelling: millions of developers already use the platform, and making Postgres AI-native will define the next generation of application development. I'm holding a Pinecone offer at $240K / $320K equity and a Weaviate offer at $235K / $300K equity. Supabase's broader platform and existing developer base make the AI investment larger in scope and impact. I need $250K base, $365K equity/4yr, and a $45K signing bonus. At $250K, I commit to making Supabase the best database for AI. My floor is $230K — below that, the dedicated vector database companies' focused missions become more compelling."
