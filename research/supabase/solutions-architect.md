### Solutions Architect | Supabase Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Enterprise-Premium Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Firebase Alternative Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI-Powered Enterprise Database Migration

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$220K | $120K–$260K | 10–15% | $250K–$370K |
| Remote US | $155K–$210K | $120K–$260K | 10–15% | $238K–$355K |
| London | £125K–£168K | £91K–£198K | 10–15% | £190K–£282K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Supabase are the technical bridge between the platform and enterprise customers — designing Postgres architectures for large-scale deployments, leading Firebase-to-Supabase migrations, and ensuring that enterprise engineering teams successfully adopt the platform. This is a revenue-critical role in a company whose enterprise growth depends on successful technical evaluations: every enterprise deal requires the SA to demonstrate that Supabase can handle the customer's data scale, performance requirements, security needs, and compliance mandates.

Supabase SA compensation combines competitive base salaries reaching $220K with equity and performance bonuses tied to enterprise deal outcomes. The negotiation leverage for SAs comes from the direct revenue impact: every enterprise migration you lead and every technical evaluation you win directly increases Supabase's ARR. If you bring Postgres enterprise architecture experience or Firebase migration expertise, you hold strong leverage.

**Level Mapping:** Supabase Solutions Architect = Google Cloud Customer Engineer = AWS Solutions Architect = MongoDB Solutions Architect = PlanetScale Solutions Engineer

### AI-Powered Enterprise Database Migration Lever
Supabase's 2026 enterprise strategy includes AI-powered migration tooling — using LLMs to analyze customer codebases, generate migration plans from Firebase/other backends, and automate schema design for Supabase. Solutions Architects who can leverage AI tools to accelerate enterprise adoption are the most valuable SAs in the pipeline. If you can demonstrate experience using AI to streamline technical migrations, you hold differentiated leverage.

Position yourself as an SA who reduces enterprise time-to-value: AI-assisted migrations mean faster deals, higher conversion rates, and happier enterprise customers. This efficiency commands premium compensation.

**Global Levers**
1. **Firebase Migration Expertise:** "I've led large-scale Firebase-to-Postgres migrations — exactly the customer journey Supabase's enterprise team facilitates daily. I'm targeting $215K base and $250K equity/4yr."
2. **Enterprise Postgres Architecture:** "I've designed enterprise Postgres architectures — high-availability, replication, partitioning, and performance optimization for mission-critical workloads. I want $220K base."
3. **AI-Powered Migration Premium:** "I leverage AI tools to accelerate enterprise migrations — automated codebase analysis, AI-generated migration plans, and intelligent schema recommendations. I'm looking for $220K base and $255K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "MongoDB SA is offering $210K / $240K RSU. AWS Solutions Architect is at $205K / $250K RSU. Supabase's growth trajectory and pre-IPO equity are compelling, but I need $215K base and $250K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've spent my career helping enterprise teams migrate to modern database platforms — exactly what Supabase's enterprise motion requires. I'm holding a MongoDB SA offer at $210K / $240K RSU and an AWS offer at $205K / $250K RSU. Supabase's open-source Postgres alternative story and the chance to lead enterprise adoption at this growth stage are uniquely compelling. I need $220K base, $255K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $220K, I start closing enterprise deals immediately. My floor is $200K — below that, MongoDB's established enterprise brand makes the decision."
