### Data Engineer | Supabase Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Firebase Alternative Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI-Powered Data Pipeline Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$210K | $120K–$240K | 5–10% | $218K–$315K |
| Remote US | $155K–$200K | $120K–$240K | 5–10% | $206K–$300K |
| London | £125K–£160K | £91K–£183K | 5–10% | £166K–£240K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Supabase build the analytics, telemetry, and data infrastructure that powers both the platform's internal intelligence and customer-facing data features. At a company built on Postgres, the data engineering function is uniquely central: you'll design the pipelines that process billions of database operations across thousands of customer instances, build the usage analytics that drive pricing and capacity planning, and create the observability infrastructure that ensures platform reliability. Your work directly impacts Supabase's ability to scale its multi-tenant Postgres infrastructure efficiently.

Supabase's Data Engineer compensation reflects the company's remote-first philosophy and growth-stage positioning. Base salaries reach $210K in top metros, with equity grants of $120K–$240K. The negotiation leverage for data engineers comes from the uniqueness of Supabase's data challenges — processing telemetry from thousands of Postgres instances, building usage-based billing pipelines, and creating the data foundation for AI-powered platform features. If you bring Postgres-native data engineering skills alongside modern pipeline architecture experience, you're addressing a specific and high-value need.

### AI-Powered Data Pipeline Intelligence Lever
Supabase's 2026 data engineering initiative focuses on AI-powered pipeline intelligence — using ML to optimize query routing across customer instances, predict capacity needs, detect anomalous usage patterns, and provide intelligent recommendations to customers about their database performance. Data Engineers who bring ML pipeline experience alongside Postgres data engineering skills are positioned to lead this transformation.

Position your negotiation around the ML-data engineering intersection: building pipelines that serve both operational analytics and AI model training. This dual-purpose data engineering is the foundation of Supabase's intelligent platform vision, and engineers who can implement it command a premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Postgres-Native Data Engineering:** "I've built data pipelines on Postgres at scale — processing billions of rows, optimizing ETL for Postgres-specific patterns, and designing analytics architectures on the same technology Supabase is built on. I'm targeting $205K base and $230K equity/4yr."
2. **Multi-Tenant Platform Analytics:** "I've designed telemetry and analytics systems for multi-tenant SaaS platforms — exactly the data engineering challenge Supabase faces at scale. I want $210K base."
3. **AI Pipeline Intelligence Premium:** "I build data pipelines that serve both analytics and ML model training — the AI-powered platform intelligence Supabase is investing in. I'm looking for $210K base and $235K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Snowflake is offering $200K base with $220K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. Databricks is at $195K / $230K RSU. Supabase's Postgres-native data challenges and pre-IPO upside are compelling, but I need $205K base and $230K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building data infrastructure for a Postgres-native platform at Supabase's scale — the data engineering challenges here are genuinely unique. I'm holding a Snowflake offer at $200K / $220K RSU and a Databricks offer at $195K / $230K RSU. Supabase's open-source mission and the chance to build AI-powered data intelligence are what differentiate this role. I need $210K base, $235K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $210K, I commit. My floor is $190K — below that, Snowflake's liquid equity wins."
