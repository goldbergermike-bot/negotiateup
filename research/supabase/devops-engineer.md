**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Supabase manage one of the most complex multi-tenant Postgres operations in the world — provisioning, scaling, monitoring, and securing thousands of customer database instances across multiple cloud providers and regions. This is not standard DevOps: you're operating a distributed Postgres fleet where every instance is a customer's production database, downtime directly impacts customer revenue, and the platform must scale seamlessly from free-tier hobby projects to enterprise workloads processing millions of queries per second. You'll build the automation, monitoring, and incident response systems that keep this fleet running at five-nines reliability.

Supabase's DevOps compensation reflects the critical nature of database operations for a company whose product is literally a managed database platform. Base salaries reach $220K, with equity grants of $130K–$260K. The negotiation leverage for DevOps engineers comes from the extreme operational complexity: managing thousands of Postgres instances is a rare skill that few companies require at this scale, and the candidates who can do it well are in high demand from cloud database teams at AWS (RDS/Aurora), Google Cloud SQL, and competing database startups.

**Level Mapping:** Supabase DevOps Engineer = Google L4 SRE = Meta E4 Production Engineer = AWS Database Operations Engineer = CockroachDB SRE

### AI-Augmented Postgres Operations Lever
Supabase's 2026 DevOps vision includes AI-augmented database operations — using ML models for predictive autoscaling of Postgres instances, intelligent alerting that predicts failures before they occur, and automated remediation of common database issues. DevOps Engineers who bring AIOps experience alongside Postgres operations expertise are positioned to lead this initiative. If you can build systems that combine Postgres operational knowledge with ML-powered intelligence, you're addressing Supabase's highest-priority infrastructure investment.

Negotiate the AIOps-Postgres premium: the intersection of ML-powered operations and Postgres-specific expertise is an extremely narrow talent pool. Engineers who can implement AI-augmented database operations command a 10–20% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Postgres Fleet Operations:** "I've managed large-scale Postgres fleets — provisioning, scaling, backup/recovery, and performance monitoring across hundreds of instances. This maps directly to Supabase's core operational challenge. I'm targeting $215K base and $250K equity/4yr."
2. **Multi-Tenant Database Operations:** "I've operated multi-tenant database infrastructure at scale — tenant isolation, resource management, and automated provisioning for thousands of customers. I want $220K base."
3. **AI-Augmented Operations Premium:** "I've built ML-powered monitoring and predictive scaling systems for database infrastructure. This AIOps expertise is exactly what Supabase's 2026 operations strategy needs. I'm looking for $220K base and $255K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "AWS RDS Operations is offering $210K base / $240K RSU in liquid equity. CockroachDB SRE is at $205K / $230K equity. Supabase's Postgres-native operations challenge and pre-IPO equity are compelling, but I need $215K base and $250K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I specialize in operating Postgres at scale — the exact technical challenge that defines Supabase's infrastructure. I'm holding an AWS RDS offer at $210K / $240K RSU and a CockroachDB offer at $205K / $230K equity. Supabase's operational complexity — managing thousands of customer Postgres instances with AI-augmented reliability — is the most interesting DevOps challenge in the database space. I need $220K base, $255K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $220K, I'm ready to commit. My floor is $200K — below that, AWS's operational resources and liquid equity make it the safer choice."
