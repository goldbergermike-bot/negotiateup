### Technical Program Manager | Supabase Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Program-Premium Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Firebase Alternative Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI Feature Launch Orchestration

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$220K | $120K–$260K | 10–15% | $250K–$365K |
| Remote US | $155K–$210K | $120K–$260K | 10–15% | $238K–$350K |
| London | £125K–£168K | £91K–£198K | 10–15% | £190K–£278K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Supabase orchestrate the most complex cross-functional initiatives — from major platform releases and Postgres version upgrades to enterprise feature rollouts and AI capability launches. This is a high-impact TPM role in a company where open-source releases have both community and commercial dimensions, remote-first execution demands exceptional async coordination skills, and the rapid pace of feature development requires meticulous planning across database, authentication, storage, and AI teams.

Supabase TPM compensation reaches $220K base with equity grants of $120K–$260K. The negotiation leverage for TPMs comes from demonstrating experience managing complex programs in remote-first, open-source-driven environments — coordination across distributed teams, community release management, and enterprise delivery timelines. TPMs who can also navigate AI product launch complexity hold the strongest hand.

### AI Feature Launch Orchestration Lever
Supabase's 2026 program management challenge is orchestrating the rapid launch of AI-native features — pgvector upgrades, AI-powered dashboard capabilities, and vector search enhancements. AI feature launches require coordinating ML engineers, database engineers, product teams, and documentation writers through iterative, uncertainty-laden development cycles. TPMs who understand AI product development lifecycles are critical to Supabase's ability to ship AI features at startup velocity.

Negotiate the AI program management premium: coordinating AI feature development requires understanding model evaluation, vector performance benchmarking, and AI-specific quality gates. This specialized TPM capability commands a 10–15% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Remote-First Program Execution:** "I've managed complex programs across fully distributed teams — async coordination, timezone management, and remote-first communication. I'm targeting $215K base and $250K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Feature Launch Experience:** "I've orchestrated AI product launches — model releases, evaluation pipeline coordination, and AI-specific quality reviews. I want $220K base."
3. **Open-Source Release Management:** "I've managed open-source project releases with community coordination — exactly the TPM challenge Supabase faces. I'm looking for $215K base and $245K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Google TPM L5 is offering $210K / $255K RSU. MongoDB TPM is at $205K / $235K RSU. Supabase's growth trajectory and AI feature roadmap are more exciting, but I need $215K base and $250K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've managed complex programs in remote-first, open-source environments — the exact coordination challenge Supabase faces at scale. I'm holding a Google L5 TPM offer at $210K / $255K RSU and a MongoDB TPM offer at $205K / $235K RSU. Supabase's pace of AI feature development and the chance to orchestrate the platform's transformation into an AI-native backend are compelling. I need $220K base, $255K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $220K, I'm committed. My floor is $200K — below that, Google's TPM structure and liquid equity win."
