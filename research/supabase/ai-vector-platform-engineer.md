### AI Vector Platform Engineer | Supabase Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** AI-Premium Base + Significant Pre-IPO Equity | Firebase Alternative Pioneer | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15-25% VECTOR AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $210K–$275K | $250K–$480K | 5–10% | $330K–$510K |
| Remote US | $200K–$265K | $250K–$480K | 5–10% | $318K–$495K |
| London | £160K–£209K | £190K–£365K | 5–10% | £251K–£388K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The AI Vector Platform Engineer is Supabase's signature role — the position that defines the company's AI-native future and its competitive differentiation against every backend platform in the market. You will build and optimize the vector search and AI infrastructure layer that makes Supabase the default database for AI applications: pgvector performance engineering, embedding pipeline infrastructure, semantic search primitives, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) platform capabilities, and the AI-powered database intelligence features that enterprise customers demand. This role sits at the intersection of Postgres internals engineering, vector database science, and AI infrastructure — you're making the world's most popular open-source relational database into the best vector database too. The +15-25% Vector AI Premium applies because this role requires a rare combination of Postgres core expertise, vector search algorithm knowledge, and AI infrastructure engineering — skills that dedicated vector database companies (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) are willing to pay top dollar for, and that Supabase must match or exceed.

Supabase CEO Paul Copplestone has publicly positioned vector search and AI capabilities as the company's primary growth vector for 2026. AI Vector Platform Engineers are not just building a feature — they're defining Supabase's competitive identity in the AI era. This strategic importance translates into premium compensation: base salaries reach $275K (competing directly with Pinecone, Weaviate, and Big Tech ML teams), and equity grants of $250K–$480K reflect the expectation that this role will drive the majority of Supabase's enterprise AI adoption.

**Level Mapping:** Supabase AI Vector Platform Engineer = Google L5-L6 ML Infrastructure Engineer = Pinecone Senior/Staff Engineer = Weaviate Core Engineer = Meta E5-E6 AI Infrastructure Engineer

### pgvector as Enterprise Standard Lever
In 2026, the battle for the enterprise AI database market is between dedicated vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) and Postgres-native vector search (pgvector on Supabase). AI Vector Platform Engineers at Supabase are building the technology that proves enterprises don't need a separate vector database — they can use the Postgres they already know and trust. This is a market-defining argument, and the engineers building the proof are creating technology that determines whether Supabase captures the $10B+ AI data infrastructure market or cedes it to purpose-built competitors.

Negotiate from the position that you are building market-defining infrastructure. Every performance improvement to pgvector, every new vector indexing algorithm, and every RAG primitive you build directly impacts whether enterprises choose Supabase or a dedicated vector database. Frame your compensation around this market-level impact: you're not optimizing a feature, you're competing for a multi-billion-dollar market on behalf of the company.

**Global Levers**
1. **Vector Database Engineering Scarcity:** "There are perhaps 200 engineers globally with deep expertise in vector indexing algorithms, ANN search optimization, and embedding pipeline engineering combined with production Postgres experience. That extreme scarcity means compensation must reflect the market. I'm targeting $270K base and $460K equity/4yr."
2. **Postgres Extension Engineering Mastery:** "I've built Postgres extensions that operate at the kernel level — custom index types, storage engines, and query planner hooks. Making pgvector competitive with dedicated vector databases requires this depth. I want $275K base with a $55K signing bonus."
3. **Competing Vector DB Company Offers:** "Pinecone is offering me $260K base / $420K equity for core vector search engineering. Weaviate is at $255K / $380K equity. Supabase's opportunity is larger — you're making Postgres the vector database, not building another point solution — but I need $270K base and $470K equity to match the dedicated-AI-DB packages."
4. **RAG Infrastructure Architecture:** "I've designed RAG platform infrastructure at scale — embedding pipelines, vector indexing, retrieval optimization, and reranking systems. Supabase's RAG primitives will make the platform indispensable for AI applications. I'm looking for $275K base, $475K equity/4yr, with front-loaded vesting."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've dedicated my career to the intersection of database systems and AI infrastructure — vector search algorithms, embedding pipelines, and making relational databases AI-native. The Supabase AI Vector Platform Engineer role is the most important position in the AI database market: you're not building another vector database, you're making Postgres — the database billions of applications already depend on — into the best vector database. I'm holding a Pinecone offer at $260K / $420K equity and a Weaviate offer at $255K / $380K equity. Both are building excellent vector databases. But Supabase is building the future of Postgres, and making it AI-native is the work I want to do. I need $275K base, $480K equity/4yr with 40% year-one vesting, and a $60K signing bonus. The Vector AI Premium applies — this role requires Postgres kernel expertise, vector algorithm mastery, and AI infrastructure engineering that almost no one combines. At $275K, I commit to making pgvector the enterprise standard for AI data infrastructure. My floor is $250K — below that, the dedicated vector database companies' focus and competitive equity make the decision for me."
