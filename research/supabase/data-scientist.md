### Data Scientist | Supabase Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Firebase Alternative Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI-Driven Product & Platform Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$215K | $120K–$250K | 5–10% | $220K–$325K |
| Remote US | $155K–$205K | $120K–$250K | 5–10% | $208K–$310K |
| London | £125K–£164K | £91K–£190K | 5–10% | £167K–£247K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Supabase leverage the company's unique position — operating thousands of Postgres instances with billions of queries — to drive product decisions, optimize platform performance, and build intelligence that improves the developer experience. You'll analyze developer adoption funnels, model usage patterns that inform pricing strategy, and build predictive models for platform capacity planning. At Supabase, data science is fundamentally Postgres-native: your analytical work sits on the same technology the product is built on, giving you unmatched access to rich, structured data.

Supabase's Data Scientist compensation is benchmarked against growth-stage infrastructure companies, with base salaries reaching $215K and equity grants of $120K–$250K. The negotiation angle for data scientists centers on the unique analytical opportunities at Supabase — access to platform-level Postgres telemetry across thousands of customer databases is a data scientist's dream dataset for building models that improve database performance, predict developer needs, and drive enterprise conversion.

### AI-Driven Product & Platform Intelligence Lever
Supabase's 2026 data science agenda focuses on AI-driven platform intelligence — building ML models that automatically optimize customer database performance, predict scaling needs, and provide intelligent recommendations. Data Scientists who can bridge product analytics with ML model development are uniquely positioned: you're not just analyzing data, you're building the intelligence layer that makes Supabase's platform smarter for every customer.

Negotiate the ML-product intelligence premium: data scientists who can build models that ship as product features (not just inform dashboards) are the most valuable analytical hires at infrastructure companies. This capability commands a 10–15% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Product-Led Growth Analytics:** "I've driven PLG optimization at scale — analyzing developer adoption funnels, building propensity models, and quantifying feature impact on conversion. I'm targeting $210K base and $240K equity/4yr."
2. **Database Performance ML:** "I've built ML models for database performance optimization — query prediction, anomaly detection, and intelligent resource allocation. This maps directly to Supabase's platform intelligence roadmap. I want $215K base."
3. **Multi-Tenant Platform Analytics:** "I have experience analyzing multi-tenant SaaS platforms at scale — customer segmentation, usage prediction, and churn modeling across thousands of tenants. I'm looking for $210K base and $245K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Spread:** "Snowflake is offering $205K base / $230K RSU in liquid equity. Databricks DS is at $200K / $240K RSU. Supabase's data richness and pre-IPO equity are compelling, but I need $210K base and $240K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Supabase's data challenges are uniquely compelling — the chance to build intelligence on top of a Postgres platform serving thousands of production databases is a data scientist's ideal problem space. I'm holding a Snowflake offer at $205K / $230K RSU and a Databricks offer at $200K / $240K RSU. Supabase's AI-native platform vision and the richness of the data are what differentiate this role. I need $215K base, $245K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $215K, I'm in. My floor is $195K — below that, Snowflake's liquid equity makes the decision."
