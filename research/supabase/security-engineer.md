**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Supabase protect one of the most sensitive infrastructures in developer tooling — thousands of customer Postgres databases containing production application data. This is an extraordinarily high-stakes security role: every customer database on Supabase contains their users' data, making the platform a high-value target. You'll design multi-tenant isolation architectures for Postgres, build row-level security (RLS) tooling that customers rely on, implement encryption at rest and in transit across the fleet, and ensure compliance certifications (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR) that enterprise customers require.

Supabase's Security Engineer compensation reflects the critical nature of database security for a company whose enterprise sales depend entirely on trust. Base salaries reach $235K, with equity grants of $140K–$280K. The negotiation leverage comes from the extreme sensitivity of the data Supabase manages — this isn't website security, it's database security at scale with direct regulatory implications. Security engineers with Postgres security expertise, multi-tenant isolation experience, or database compliance backgrounds hold significant leverage.

**Level Mapping:** Supabase Security Engineer = Google L4-L5 Security Engineer = Meta E4-E5 Security Engineer = AWS Database Security Engineer = MongoDB Security Engineer

### AI-Powered Database Security & Compliance Lever
Supabase's 2026 security roadmap includes AI-powered security features — ML-based anomaly detection for database access patterns, AI-assisted compliance monitoring, and intelligent security policy recommendations for customers. Security Engineers who bring AI security expertise alongside database security skills are the highest-priority security hires. As Supabase integrates AI features (vector search, AI-powered query tools), securing these capabilities against AI-specific attack vectors becomes critical.

Negotiate the AI-database security premium: the intersection of AI security, database security, and compliance is an extremely narrow talent pool commanding a 15–20% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Database Security Specialization:** "I've built security architectures for managed database platforms — multi-tenant isolation, encryption, access control, and audit logging at scale. I'm targeting $230K base and $270K equity/4yr."
2. **Postgres Security Expertise:** "I have deep Postgres security experience — RLS policies, pgcrypto, audit extensions, and Postgres-specific hardening. This directly applies to Supabase's security model. I want $235K base."
3. **AI Security Premium:** "I bring experience securing AI systems — ML-powered anomaly detection, AI feature security, and securing vector search against adversarial inputs. This is critical for Supabase's AI roadmap. I'm looking for $235K base and $275K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Spread:** "AWS Database Security is offering $225K / $260K RSU in liquid equity. MongoDB Security is at $220K / $250K RSU. Supabase's database security challenges and pre-IPO equity are compelling, but I need $230K base and $270K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I specialize in database security at scale — the exact challenge that defines Supabase's security posture. I'm holding an AWS Database Security offer at $225K / $260K RSU and a MongoDB Security offer at $220K / $250K RSU. Supabase's multi-tenant Postgres security challenges and the chance to build AI-powered security capabilities are what make this unique. I need $235K base, $275K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. At $235K, I'm committed. My floor is $215K — below that, AWS's security resources and liquid equity win out."
