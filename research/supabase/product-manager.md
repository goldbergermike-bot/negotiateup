**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Supabase own the strategy for products used by hundreds of thousands of developers — the database platform, authentication, storage, real-time subscriptions, edge functions, and the rapidly growing AI/vector capabilities. This is a technically demanding PM role: you need to understand Postgres internals well enough to make database feature prioritization decisions, navigate the open-source community's expectations while driving commercial revenue, and balance the needs of indie developers (Supabase's growth engine) with enterprise customers (Supabase's revenue engine). PMs at Supabase also operate in a remote-first, async-heavy environment that demands exceptional written communication.

Supabase PM compensation reaches $225K base with equity grants of $150K–$310K. The negotiation leverage for PMs comes from demonstrating the rare combination of technical database knowledge, open-source product strategy experience, and developer-facing product management skills. PMs who can also articulate a vision for AI-native backend products hold the strongest hand.

**Level Mapping:** Supabase PM = Google L5 PM = Meta IC5 PM = PlanetScale PM = MongoDB Senior PM

### AI-Native Backend Product Strategy Lever
Supabase's 2026 product strategy is defined by making the platform the default AI-native backend — integrating vector search, AI-powered database management, and intelligent platform features into the core product. PMs who can define AI product strategy for developer infrastructure are Supabase's most critical product hires. This means understanding LLM application patterns, vector database use cases, and how AI changes the developer's interaction with their backend.

Position yourself as a PM who can bridge the AI-infrastructure gap: understanding both what AI applications need from their backend and how to deliver those capabilities as simple, developer-friendly features. This intersection is where Supabase's next $100M in ARR will come from.

**Global Levers**
1. **Developer Platform PM Expertise:** "I've led product strategy for developer platforms — balancing community growth, developer experience, and enterprise monetization. I'm targeting $220K base and $300K equity/4yr."
2. **AI-Backend Product Vision:** "I've shipped AI-powered infrastructure products — defining capabilities, designing developer experiences, and establishing metrics for AI features. This is Supabase's highest strategic priority. I want $225K base."
3. **Open-Source Product Strategy:** "I've navigated the open-source-to-enterprise product transition — building commercial products on open-source foundations while maintaining community trust. I'm looking for $220K base and $305K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "MongoDB is offering PM at $215K / $280K RSU. PlanetScale is at $210K / $260K equity. Supabase's broader platform vision and AI-native strategy are more compelling, but I need $220K base and $300K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've built my PM career at the intersection of developer tools and AI product strategy — shipping products that developers love while driving enterprise revenue. I'm holding a MongoDB PM offer at $215K / $280K RSU and a PlanetScale offer at $210K / $260K equity. Supabase's open-source mission and the chance to define the AI-native backend product category are what differentiate this role. I need $225K base, $305K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. At $225K, I'm ready to sign. My floor is $205K — below that, MongoDB's established enterprise model and liquid equity make it the safer bet."
