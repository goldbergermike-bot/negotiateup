### Software Engineer | Supabase Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Open-Source-Aligned Comp + Pre-IPO Equity | Firebase Alternative Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI-Native Backend Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$205K | $120K–$240K | 5–10% | $210K–$305K |
| Remote US | $150K–$195K | $120K–$240K | 5–10% | $198K–$290K |
| London | £120K–£156K | £91K–£183K | 5–10% | £159K–£232K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Supabase build the open-source backend platform that's rapidly replacing Firebase for thousands of developers and startups — from the Postgres-powered database layer and real-time subscriptions to authentication, storage, and edge functions. Supabase's engineering culture is deeply open-source: nearly everything you build ships as open-source code on GitHub, your work is publicly scrutinized by a massive developer community, and your contributions directly shape an ecosystem that tens of thousands of developers depend on daily. This is a rare SWE role where your code has both commercial and community impact from day one.

Supabase's compensation reflects its position as a well-funded growth-stage startup ($116M+ raised, valued at $2B+) with a remote-first culture. Base salaries are competitive for remote-first companies at $160K–$205K for SF-based engineers, with geographic adjustments for remote employees. Equity grants of $120K–$240K over four years represent meaningful pre-IPO ownership. The negotiation dynamic: Supabase competes for talent against both Big Tech database teams and the growing ecosystem of developer infrastructure startups (PlanetScale, Neon, Turso), so candidates with Postgres expertise or open-source credentials have strong leverage.

### AI-Native Backend Infrastructure Lever
Supabase's 2026 strategy centers on making AI-native backend infrastructure seamless — pgvector for vector search, AI-powered query optimization, and integrated AI tooling that makes Supabase the default backend for AI applications. Software Engineers who bring Postgres internals knowledge combined with AI/ML infrastructure experience are positioned to work on Supabase's highest-priority product initiatives. If you've built vector databases, worked on embedding storage systems, or contributed to Postgres extensions, you hold differentiated leverage.

Frame your negotiation around the AI-backend convergence: as every application becomes AI-powered, the backend infrastructure must evolve to support vector operations, embedding storage, and AI-native data patterns. Engineers at this intersection are scarce and valuable, commanding a 10–15% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Postgres Expertise Premium:** "I have deep Postgres internals experience — extensions, query optimization, replication, and performance tuning. This is the core technology Supabase is built on. I'm targeting $200K base and $230K equity/4yr."
2. **Open-Source Community Impact:** "I've built and maintained popular open-source projects with thousands of GitHub stars. My community credibility accelerates Supabase's developer adoption. I want $205K base."
3. **AI-Backend Infrastructure Premium:** "I've built vector search systems and AI-native database infrastructure — pgvector optimization, embedding pipelines, and semantic search. This is Supabase's highest-growth area. I'm looking for $205K base and $235K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "PlanetScale is offering $195K base with $200K equity/4yr. Neon is at $190K / $220K equity. Supabase's open-source mission and broader platform vision are more compelling, but I need $200K base and $230K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm drawn to Supabase because building the open-source backend that replaces Firebase — and extending it with AI-native capabilities — is the most impactful infrastructure work available. I'm holding a PlanetScale offer at $195K / $200K equity and a Neon offer at $190K / $220K equity. Supabase's broader platform vision (auth, storage, edge functions, AI) and community scale are what differentiate this opportunity. I need $205K base, $235K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $205K, I'm committed. My floor is $185K — below that, PlanetScale's focused database mission and competitive equity win."
