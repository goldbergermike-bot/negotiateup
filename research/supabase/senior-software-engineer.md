**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Supabase own critical platform subsystems — the real-time engine, the authentication layer, the storage infrastructure, the edge functions runtime, or the Postgres extensions ecosystem. At this level, you set technical direction for your domain, mentor engineers across the open-source community, and make architectural decisions that shape how tens of thousands of applications interact with their backend. Supabase's remote-first, open-source-first culture means senior engineers operate with significant autonomy and their work is highly visible to the developer community.

Senior SWE compensation at Supabase reaches $250K base in top metros with equity grants of $200K–$380K reflecting meaningful pre-IPO ownership. The company's rapid revenue growth (driven by enterprise Postgres adoption and AI/vector features) makes the equity component increasingly compelling. At the Senior level, the negotiation dynamic shifts: Supabase knows that senior engineers are weighing offers from Google Cloud's database team, AWS RDS/Aurora, and well-funded database startups. Demonstrate Postgres depth, distributed systems expertise, or AI-infrastructure experience to push toward the top of band.

### AI-Native Backend Infrastructure Lever
Supabase's 2026 senior engineering agenda centers on architecting AI-native backend primitives — making pgvector world-class, building semantic caching layers, designing AI-powered query optimization, and creating the abstractions that make Supabase the default backend for AI applications. Senior Engineers who can architect these systems are Supabase's most strategic technical hires. If you've designed vector database architectures, built embedding pipeline systems, or contributed to Postgres AI extensions, you hold leverage that directly maps to the product roadmap.

Frame your negotiation around architectural leadership in the AI-backend space: you're not just writing code, you're designing the systems that define how AI applications store and retrieve data. This architectural vision, combined with Postgres internals expertise, is worth a 15–20% premium above standard senior offers.

**Global Levers**
1. **Postgres Architecture Leadership:** "I've designed and built Postgres-based systems at enterprise scale — replication topologies, extension development, and query planner optimization. I'm targeting $245K base and $360K equity/4yr to reflect that Supabase-specific technical depth."
2. **AI-Vector Database Expertise:** "I've architected vector search systems and embedding storage infrastructure — the exact capabilities Supabase is making core to the platform. I want $250K base and $375K equity/4yr."
3. **Open-Source Maintainer Premium:** "I maintain popular open-source projects in the database/infrastructure space. My community credibility and maintainer experience directly accelerate Supabase's ecosystem growth. I'm looking for $245K base."
4. **Competing Offer Spread:** "Google Cloud Database is offering L5 at $240K base / $320K RSU in liquid equity. PlanetScale is at $235K / $300K equity. Supabase's open-source platform vision and AI-backend strategy are more compelling, but I need $245K base and $365K equity to offset the liquidity differential."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've spent my career building database infrastructure at scale — Postgres internals, distributed systems, and now AI-native data architectures. I'm holding a Google Cloud L5 offer at $240K / $320K RSU and a PlanetScale offer at $235K / $300K equity. Supabase's open-source mission and the chance to architect the AI-native backend that replaces Firebase are what make this unique. I need $250K base, $375K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $45K signing bonus. At $250K, I commit to Supabase and bring my Postgres architecture expertise to the platform's most critical systems. My floor is $230K — below that, Google's liquid equity and enterprise database resources become the rational choice."
