### Product Designer | Supabase Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Design-Premium Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Firebase Alternative Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI-Powered Developer Dashboard UX

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $155K–$200K | $100K–$210K | 5–10% | $205K–$290K |
| Remote US | $145K–$190K | $100K–$210K | 5–10% | $193K–$275K |
| London | £118K–£152K | £76K–£160K | 5–10% | £156K–£221K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Supabase shape the dashboard experience that developers interact with daily — from the database explorer and SQL editor to the authentication configuration, storage management, and real-time subscription interfaces. Designing for Supabase is uniquely challenging: your users are developers who expect interfaces to be fast, information-dense, and highly functional. Every design decision must balance the simplicity that makes Supabase accessible to indie developers with the depth and power that enterprise engineering teams demand. Supabase's design also extends to documentation and the open-source community experience, making this a high-impact role with broad surface area.

Supabase's Product Designer compensation reflects the company's remote-first model and growth-stage positioning. Base salaries reach $200K with equity grants of $100K–$210K. The negotiation angle for designers centers on the strategic importance of developer experience in Supabase's product-led growth model — every improvement to the dashboard directly impacts activation, retention, and enterprise upgrade rates. Designers who can demonstrate a portfolio of developer tool design or database interface experience hold significant leverage.

### AI-Powered Developer Dashboard UX Lever
Supabase's 2026 design vision includes AI-powered dashboard experiences — AI-assisted SQL query building, intelligent schema design recommendations, and natural language interfaces for database management. Product Designers who understand how to design AI-powered developer experiences (handling uncertainty, streaming outputs, and intelligent suggestions) are the scarcest design talent Supabase needs.

Position yourself at the frontier of AI-native developer tool design: this emerging discipline commands a 10–15% premium for designers who can create intuitive interfaces for AI-powered database interactions.

**Global Levers**
1. **Developer Tool Design Expertise:** "I've designed developer-facing products — dashboards, CLIs, database explorers, and API documentation. This DX design specialization is rare. I'm targeting $195K base and $200K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Interface Design Premium:** "I've designed AI-powered interfaces — conversational UIs, intelligent assistants, and AI-suggested workflows. Supabase's AI dashboard vision needs this expertise. I want $200K base."
3. **Database UX Specialization:** "I've designed database management interfaces — query builders, schema designers, and performance dashboards. This direct domain experience is immediately applicable. I'm looking for $200K base and $205K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "MongoDB is offering $190K base / $195K RSU. Figma is at $195K / $210K RSU. Supabase's open-source mission and AI-native design challenges are compelling, but I need $195K base and $200K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I specialize in designing developer tools and database interfaces — the exact UX challenges Supabase faces. I'm holding a MongoDB offer at $190K / $195K RSU and a Figma offer at $195K / $210K RSU. Supabase's open-source mission and the chance to design AI-powered database experiences are uniquely compelling. I need $200K base, $210K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $200K, I'm committed. My floor is $180K — below that, Figma's design-tool mission and liquid equity win."
