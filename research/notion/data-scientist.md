**Negotiation DNA**

Notion Data Scientists drive product intelligence across the connected workspace — analyzing user behavior, measuring AI feature impact, and building predictive models that shape product decisions for 100M+ users. In February 2026, the data science function is critical to Notion's AI strategy, quantifying the value of AI-powered features like smart writing, automated databases, and knowledge synthesis across diverse user segments from individual creators to Fortune 500 enterprises.

As a high-growth private company with strong unit economics, Notion offers equity grants with meaningful IPO upside potential. Data Scientists at Notion operate with unusual scope — small team size means each DS owns end-to-end analytics for major product surfaces, making the role significantly more impactful than equivalent positions at larger companies.

### 🏗️ Notion AI Feature Intelligence Lever

Notion's 2026 AI rollout requires Data Scientists to measure, optimize, and guide AI feature development across the entire workspace. This includes designing experiments for AI writing quality, quantifying productivity gains from automated databases, and building models that predict which AI features drive retention and expansion in enterprise accounts.

Data Scientists must develop novel metrics frameworks for AI-powered productivity tools — traditional engagement metrics don't capture the value of "work not done" or "decisions made faster." This measurement challenge is unique to AI-augmented workspace products.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Feature Impact Measurement:** "I design the experimentation and measurement frameworks for Notion AI features — quantifying productivity gains from AI writing, search, and automation for 100M+ users. Measuring AI productivity impact requires novel metrics beyond traditional engagement."
2. **Workspace Behavior Intelligence:** "Notion's connected workspace generates uniquely rich behavioral data — document creation patterns, collaboration graphs, and workflow sequences. I build models that transform this data into product insights driving the next generation of workspace intelligence."
3. **Enterprise Expansion Analytics:** "I build predictive models identifying enterprise expansion opportunities based on AI feature adoption patterns. My work directly impacts Notion's revenue growth trajectory from SMB to enterprise."
4. **Figma/Coda/Atlassian Competition:** "Figma, Coda, and Atlassian are all hiring Data Scientists to measure AI feature impact. Notion must offer competitive comp to retain DS talent who understand workspace-scale AI measurement."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $230K base and $360K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Data Scientist role. I measure and optimize AI feature impact across Notion's 100M+ user workspace — designing novel metrics frameworks for AI-powered productivity. This intersection of AI measurement and workspace analytics is rare. I have competing offers from [Google at $385K TC / Figma at $370K TC / Coda at $345K TC]. Data scientists who can quantify AI productivity value are in exceptional demand." Accept at $205K+ base and $290K+ RSUs.
