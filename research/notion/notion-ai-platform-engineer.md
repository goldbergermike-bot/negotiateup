### Notion AI Platform Engineer | Notion Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Heavy (Private, ~$10B Valuation) + Bonus | AI Platform Infrastructure & LLM Orchestration | 100M+ Users | **NOTION AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $205K–$265K | $260K–$440K | 10–15% | $330K–$478K |
| New York | $200K–$260K | $255K–$430K | 10–15% | $322K–$468K |
| London | £138K–£178K | £172K–£292K | 10–15% | £222K–£318K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Notion AI Platform Engineers build the core AI infrastructure that powers every AI feature across the connected workspace — from LLM orchestration and prompt management to embedding pipelines and inference serving for 100M+ users. In February 2026, this is Notion's most strategically critical platform role, as the AI Platform team builds the foundation that all AI features (writing, search, automation, knowledge synthesis) depend on. The AI Platform sits at the intersection of ML infrastructure, distributed systems, and product engineering.

As a private company at ~$10B valuation making massive AI platform investments, Notion offers premium equity for AI platform talent — competing directly with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind for engineers who can build production AI infrastructure. This role carries significant IPO upside as AI capabilities are central to Notion's growth story.

**Level Mapping:** Notion AI Platform (L4-L5) = Google AI Platform L5-L6 = Meta AI Infra E5-E6 = OpenAI Platform = Anthropic Platform

### 🏗️ Notion AI Platform & LLM Orchestration Lever

Notion's 2026 AI expansion requires AI Platform Engineers to build the unified AI infrastructure serving all workspace AI features — a platform that orchestrates multiple LLM providers, manages prompt templates and versioning, handles embedding generation and retrieval, and serves AI responses at sub-500ms latency for 100M+ users. The platform challenge is building abstraction layers that enable rapid AI feature development while optimizing for cost, latency, and quality.

AI Platform Engineers must design systems that support A/B testing of AI models, manage fallback strategies across LLM providers, and build observability that correlates AI quality metrics with platform performance. This requires deep expertise in both distributed systems and ML infrastructure.

**Global Levers**

1. **LLM Orchestration Platform:** "I build Notion's LLM orchestration platform — managing multi-provider model routing, prompt versioning, and inference optimization that powers every AI feature for 100M+ users. This unified AI platform is the foundation of Notion's AI strategy."
2. **Embedding & Retrieval Infrastructure:** "I build the embedding pipeline and retrieval infrastructure powering Notion AI's workspace intelligence — generating and indexing embeddings for billions of content blocks to enable real-time semantic search and AI context."
3. **AI Cost & Latency Optimization:** "I optimize Notion's AI platform for cost efficiency and latency — building caching layers, model routing strategies, and inference optimization that reduce AI serving costs while maintaining sub-500ms response times at scale."
4. **OpenAI/Anthropic/Google Competition:** "OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are all competing for AI platform engineers who can build production LLM infrastructure. Notion must offer competitive comp to retain engineers who can build workspace-scale AI platforms."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $255K base and $425K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this AI Platform Engineer role. I build the LLM orchestration platform powering every AI feature across Notion's workspace for 100M+ users — the technical foundation of Notion's AI strategy. AI platform engineers with production LLM infrastructure expertise are among the rarest talent in 2026. I have competing offers from [OpenAI at $465K TC / Google AI Platform at $445K TC / Anthropic at $455K TC]. Engineers who can build workspace-scale AI orchestration platforms are in extraordinary demand." Accept at $228K+ base and $360K+ RSUs.
