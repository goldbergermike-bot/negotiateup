**Negotiation DNA**

Notion Engineering Managers lead teams building the connected workspace and AI features used by 100M+ users — owning technical strategy, team growth, and delivery for critical product surfaces including documents, databases, wikis, and AI capabilities. In February 2026, EMs are central to Notion's AI transformation, leading teams that integrate AI across every workspace feature while scaling engineering culture and processes to support rapid product expansion.

As a private company at ~$10B valuation with strong revenue growth, Notion offers leadership-tier equity with substantial IPO upside. Engineering Managers at Notion have unusually high scope — the company runs lean engineering teams, so each EM typically owns a major product surface end-to-end with direct influence on product direction and company strategy.

### 🏗️ Notion AI Product Integration Leadership Lever

Notion's 2026 AI strategy requires Engineering Managers to lead cross-functional teams integrating AI into every workspace surface — from AI writing in documents to automated formulas in databases to intelligent project management. The leadership challenge involves balancing rapid AI feature shipping with workspace reliability, managing teams across ML and product engineering disciplines, and making build-vs-buy decisions for AI capabilities.

EMs must navigate the organizational complexity of AI integration — coordinating between ML engineers, product engineers, and infrastructure teams while maintaining Notion's culture of high-quality, user-centric product development at an increasingly fast pace.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Integration Team Leadership:** "I lead the engineering team integrating AI across Notion's workspace — managing ML and product engineers who build AI writing, search, and automation features for 100M+ users. Leading cross-disciplinary AI teams at this product scale requires rare management expertise."
2. **Connected Workspace Complexity:** "Notion's product surface is uniquely complex — documents, databases, wikis, and projects all interconnected. I lead teams that ship features spanning these surfaces while maintaining the simplicity and reliability users expect."
3. **Engineering Culture Scaling:** "I'm building Notion's engineering culture during its most critical growth phase — scaling from startup practices to enterprise-grade processes while preserving the craft and speed that define Notion's product quality."
4. **Figma/Coda/Linear Competition:** "Figma, Coda, and Linear are all competing for engineering leaders who can drive AI-powered product development. Notion must offer competitive leadership comp to retain EMs who can lead cross-disciplinary teams at workspace scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $265K base and $480K RSUs over 4 years with 20% performance bonus for this Engineering Manager role. I lead the team integrating AI across Notion's workspace for 100M+ users — managing cross-disciplinary ML and product engineering teams. Engineering leaders who can drive AI product integration at this scale are exceptionally rare. I have competing offers from [Google EM at $510K TC / Figma EM at $495K TC / Meta EM at $520K TC]. EMs who can lead AI-powered workspace development are in extraordinary demand." Accept at $240K+ base and $400K+ RSUs.
