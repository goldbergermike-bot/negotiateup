### Data Engineer | Notion Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Heavy (Private, ~$10B Valuation) + Bonus | AI-Powered Connected Workspace | 100M+ Users | **NOTION AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K–$230K | $200K–$350K | 10–15% | $280K–$385K |
| New York | $180K–$225K | $195K–$340K | 10–15% | $272K–$375K |
| London | £120K–£155K | £130K–£225K | 10–15% | £178K–£252K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Notion Data Engineers build the data infrastructure powering the connected workspace used by 100M+ users — from collaborative document analytics to workspace intelligence to the data foundations enabling Notion AI. In February 2026, Notion's strategic focus centers on deepening its AI capabilities across the entire workspace: AI-powered writing, database automation, knowledge synthesis, and cross-workspace search. Data Engineers build the pipelines that process, index, and surface insights from billions of user-generated documents, databases, and workflows.

As a private company valued at approximately $10B with strong revenue growth, Notion offers substantial equity grants that could yield significant upside at IPO. The company's San Francisco headquarters and selective hiring mean compensation is highly competitive, particularly for engineers who can scale data infrastructure to support AI workloads across a rapidly growing user base.

### 🏗️ Notion AI Workspace Intelligence Lever

Notion's 2026 AI strategy requires Data Engineers to build the real-time data infrastructure that powers AI features across every workspace — from intelligent document suggestions to automated database entries to cross-workspace knowledge graphs. The data challenge involves processing billions of heterogeneous content blocks (text, tables, images, embeds) with complex relational structures and permission hierarchies.

Data Engineers must build pipelines that enable sub-second AI inference on workspace content while maintaining strict tenant isolation and data privacy guarantees. This requires novel approaches to embedding generation, incremental indexing, and multi-modal content processing at massive scale.

**Global Levers**

1. **Notion AI Content Pipeline:** "I build the data pipelines powering Notion AI — processing billions of content blocks across 100M+ users to enable real-time AI features like intelligent writing, search, and database automation. This multi-modal content processing at workspace scale is a unique data engineering challenge."
2. **Connected Workspace Graph:** "Notion's connected workspace creates one of the most complex content graphs in enterprise software. I build data infrastructure that models relationships between documents, databases, wikis, and projects — enabling AI features that understand workspace context."
3. **Real-Time Embedding Infrastructure:** "Notion AI requires real-time embedding generation and indexing across billions of content blocks. I build pipelines that maintain sub-second freshness for AI inference while respecting complex permission hierarchies — a harder problem than single-purpose search indexing."
4. **Coda/Airtable/Google Competition:** "Coda, Airtable, and Google Workspace are all investing heavily in AI-powered productivity data infrastructure. Notion must offer competitive comp to retain data engineers who understand workspace-scale AI data pipelines."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $222K base and $340K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Data Engineer role. I build the data pipelines powering Notion AI — processing billions of content blocks for 100M+ users to enable real-time AI features. Workspace-scale AI data infrastructure expertise is exceptionally rare. I have competing offers from [Google at $365K TC / Coda at $340K TC / Airtable at $335K TC]. Data engineers who can build AI-powered workspace intelligence are in peak demand." Accept at $198K+ base and $275K+ RSUs.
