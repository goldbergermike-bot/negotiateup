Notion Solutions Architects design and deploy enterprise workspace configurations for Fortune 500 organizations — architecting how large enterprises structure their documents, databases, wikis, and AI features to support complex organizational workflows. In February 2026, the role is critical to Notion's enterprise growth strategy, as SAs guide enterprises through AI feature adoption, SSO/SCIM integration, and workspace architecture that scales to thousands of users.

As a private company at ~$10B valuation with accelerating enterprise revenue, Notion offers competitive SA compensation with meaningful equity upside. Solutions Architects bridge technical and business domains — directly influencing enterprise deal size and expansion revenue.

### 🏗️ Notion Enterprise AI Deployment Lever

Notion's 2026 enterprise AI strategy requires Solutions Architects to design deployment architectures for AI features in enterprise environments — addressing data residency requirements, SSO/SCIM integration, AI governance policies, and workspace structures that leverage AI across departments. The SA challenge involves translating enterprise security and compliance requirements into Notion workspace configurations that maximize AI value.

SAs must also develop reference architectures and deployment playbooks for AI-powered workspace migrations — guiding enterprises from legacy tools (Confluence, SharePoint, Google Workspace) to Notion with AI features activated from day one.
