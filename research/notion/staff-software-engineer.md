**Negotiation DNA**

Notion Staff Software Engineers are the technical leaders defining architecture and engineering strategy for the connected workspace — making foundational decisions about system design, AI integration architecture, and platform scalability for 100M+ users. In February 2026, Staff engineers drive the most critical technical decisions at the company: how to architect AI features into the core workspace engine, how to scale real-time collaboration to support AI workloads, and how to evolve the block-based content model for the AI era.

As a private company at ~$10B valuation, Notion offers premium equity packages for Staff-level talent with substantial IPO upside. Staff engineers at Notion have company-wide technical influence — the lean engineering organization means Staff-level decisions shape the entire product architecture.

### 🏗️ Notion AI Architecture Strategy Lever

Notion's 2026 AI transformation requires Staff Software Engineers to define the technical architecture that connects AI capabilities to the core workspace — making foundational decisions about how LLM inference integrates with real-time collaboration, how the content graph serves as context for AI features, and how the platform scales to support AI workloads alongside workspace operations.

Staff engineers must drive cross-team technical alignment on AI architecture decisions, mentor senior engineers through AI integration challenges, and establish engineering patterns that enable rapid AI feature development while maintaining system reliability and performance.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Workspace Architecture:** "I define the technical architecture connecting AI to Notion's workspace engine — foundational decisions about LLM integration, content graph AI context, and AI-workspace state management that impact every feature for 100M+ users."
2. **Platform Scalability Leadership:** "I drive Notion's platform scalability strategy — architecting systems that support both workspace operations and AI inference workloads at 100M+ user scale. These architectural decisions define Notion's technical trajectory."
3. **Cross-Team Technical Vision:** "I set technical direction across Notion's engineering organization — driving alignment between platform, AI, and product teams on architectural decisions. In a lean engineering org, Staff-level technical leadership shapes the entire product."
4. **Google/Figma/Stripe Competition:** "Google, Figma, and Stripe are competing for Staff engineers who can lead AI-integrated platform architecture. Notion must offer competitive comp to retain Staff talent who define the technical vision for the workspace."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $280K base and $530K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Staff Software Engineer role. I define the AI architecture for Notion's workspace — foundational decisions connecting LLM capabilities to the core product for 100M+ users. Staff engineers with AI-workspace architecture expertise are among the rarest talent in tech. I have competing offers from [Google L7 at $570K TC / Figma Staff at $550K TC / Stripe Staff at $545K TC]. Staff engineers who can lead AI-integrated workspace architecture are in extraordinary demand." Accept at $255K+ base and $450K+ RSUs.
