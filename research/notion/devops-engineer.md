### DevOps Engineer | Notion Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Heavy (Private, ~$10B Valuation) + Bonus | AI Infrastructure & Workspace Reliability | 100M+ Users | **NOTION AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $180K–$225K | $190K–$330K | 10–15% | $268K–$365K |
| New York | $175K–$220K | $185K–$320K | 10–15% | $260K–$355K |
| London | £118K–£150K | £125K–£215K | 10–15% | £172K–£242K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Notion DevOps Engineers own the infrastructure reliability and deployment systems for a connected workspace serving 100M+ users — managing real-time collaboration, document syncing, and AI inference workloads across a globally distributed architecture. In February 2026, the AI expansion dramatically increases infrastructure complexity, requiring DevOps engineers to manage GPU compute clusters, model serving pipelines, and inference scaling alongside the core workspace infrastructure.

As a private company with strong fundamentals, Notion's equity grants carry meaningful IPO upside. The DevOps team is lean relative to platform scale, meaning each engineer owns significant infrastructure scope with high autonomy and direct impact on platform reliability.

### 🏗️ Notion AI Infrastructure Scaling Lever

Notion's 2026 AI features require DevOps Engineers to build and manage the inference infrastructure powering AI across every workspace — from GPU cluster orchestration to model serving to real-time AI response delivery. The challenge is maintaining 99.99% uptime for both the core workspace and AI features simultaneously while managing cost efficiency across expensive GPU compute.

DevOps Engineers must build deployment pipelines that can roll out AI model updates to 100M+ users without service disruption, manage hybrid compute environments (CPU for workspace, GPU for AI), and build observability systems that correlate AI inference quality with infrastructure performance.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Inference Infrastructure:** "I build and manage the GPU infrastructure powering Notion AI — orchestrating model serving, managing inference scaling, and ensuring sub-200ms AI response times for 100M+ users. AI infrastructure operations at this scale requires specialized DevOps expertise."
2. **Real-Time Collaboration Reliability:** "Notion's real-time collaboration engine requires 99.99% uptime across a globally distributed architecture. I build the deployment and monitoring systems that ensure seamless syncing for millions of concurrent users."
3. **Hybrid Compute Orchestration:** "I manage Notion's hybrid infrastructure — CPU clusters for workspace operations and GPU clusters for AI inference. Optimizing cost and performance across these heterogeneous compute environments is a unique DevOps challenge."
4. **Vercel/Figma/Render Competition:** "Vercel, Figma, and major cloud providers are hiring DevOps engineers with AI infrastructure experience. Notion must offer competitive comp to retain engineers who can manage both workspace and AI infrastructure at scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and $320K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this DevOps Engineer role. I manage the infrastructure powering both Notion's workspace and AI features for 100M+ users — including GPU cluster orchestration and inference scaling. DevOps engineers with AI infrastructure expertise are exceptionally scarce. I have competing offers from [Google SRE at $355K TC / Vercel at $338K TC / Figma at $345K TC]. Engineers who can manage hybrid workspace+AI infrastructure are in peak demand." Accept at $192K+ base and $260K+ RSUs.
