**Negotiation DNA**

Notion Security Engineers protect the connected workspace used by 100M+ users — securing collaborative documents, databases, and AI features that contain some of the most sensitive business information in enterprise organizations. In February 2026, the AI expansion dramatically increases the security surface: AI features process workspace content through LLM inference pipelines, raising novel data privacy, prompt injection, and model security challenges that require specialized expertise.

As a private company at ~$10B valuation serving Fortune 500 enterprises, Notion invests heavily in security to maintain enterprise trust. Security Engineers have high visibility — enterprise sales depend on SOC 2, GDPR compliance, and demonstrable security posture, making security engineering directly revenue-impactful.

### 🏗️ Notion AI Security & Data Privacy Lever

Notion's 2026 AI features require Security Engineers to solve novel AI security challenges — preventing prompt injection attacks in workspace AI, ensuring tenant data isolation in LLM inference pipelines, and building security controls for AI features that process sensitive enterprise content. The security challenge is unique: AI features must access workspace content to be useful, but must maintain strict data boundaries across tenants.

Security Engineers must develop AI-specific threat models, implement guardrails against LLM-based attacks, and ensure compliance with evolving AI governance regulations across global markets while enabling the rapid AI feature development the product team demands.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Security Architecture:** "I design the security architecture for Notion AI features — preventing prompt injection, ensuring tenant isolation in LLM pipelines, and building guardrails for AI that processes sensitive enterprise content for 100M+ users. AI security engineering at this scale is a frontier challenge."
2. **Enterprise Trust & Compliance:** "Notion's enterprise expansion depends on security posture. I build and maintain the security controls — SOC 2, GDPR, AI governance — that enable Fortune 500 adoption. My work directly enables revenue growth."
3. **Zero-Trust Workspace Security:** "Notion's connected workspace requires zero-trust security across documents, databases, and AI features with complex permission hierarchies. I build security controls that maintain collaboration velocity while preventing unauthorized access."
4. **1Password/Figma/Cloudflare Competition:** "1Password, Figma, and Cloudflare are all hiring security engineers with AI security expertise. Notion must offer competitive comp to retain security talent who understand AI threat models at workspace scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $232K base and $340K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Security Engineer role. I build the AI security architecture for Notion's workspace — protecting 100M+ users from novel AI threats while enabling enterprise trust. Security engineers with AI threat modeling expertise are in extreme shortage. I have competing offers from [Google SecEng at $380K TC / 1Password at $355K TC / Cloudflare at $360K TC]. Security engineers who understand AI-specific attack surfaces are the scarcest security talent in 2026." Accept at $205K+ base and $280K+ RSUs.
