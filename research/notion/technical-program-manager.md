**Negotiation DNA**

Notion Technical Program Managers drive the execution of complex, cross-functional programs spanning AI, platform, and product engineering — coordinating the delivery of features and infrastructure for 100M+ users. In February 2026, TPMs are critical to Notion's AI rollout, managing the interdependencies between ML infrastructure, AI feature development, enterprise security requirements, and product launches across a rapidly expanding surface area.

As a private company at ~$10B valuation with a growing engineering organization, Notion offers competitive TPM compensation with meaningful equity upside. TPMs at Notion manage programs with unusually high complexity relative to team size — each TPM coordinates delivery across multiple critical product surfaces.

**Level Mapping:** Notion TPM (L4-L5) = Google TPM L5-L6 = Meta TPM E5-E6 = Figma TPM = Stripe TPM

### 🏗️ Notion AI Program Delivery Lever

Notion's 2026 AI transformation requires TPMs to manage the most complex program in the company's history — coordinating ML infrastructure buildout, AI feature development across every workspace surface, enterprise compliance certification, and API platform expansion simultaneously. The program management challenge involves tracking dependencies across teams operating at different cadences (ML research vs. product engineering vs. enterprise sales).

TPMs must balance the urgency of AI feature delivery with quality standards, manage stakeholder expectations across engineering and business leadership, and build program frameworks that scale as Notion's engineering organization grows.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Rollout Program Management:** "I manage the cross-functional program delivering Notion AI across every workspace surface — coordinating ML, platform, product, and enterprise teams. This is Notion's most complex program, spanning infrastructure, features, compliance, and go-to-market."
2. **Cross-Discipline Coordination:** "I coordinate delivery between ML engineers, product engineers, designers, and enterprise teams operating at different cadences. Managing AI program dependencies across these disciplines requires deep technical understanding and program management expertise."
3. **Enterprise Compliance Programs:** "I manage the compliance programs enabling Notion's enterprise AI deployment — SOC 2 for AI, GDPR data processing, and emerging AI governance requirements. These programs directly enable enterprise revenue."
4. **Stripe/Figma/Google Competition:** "Stripe, Figma, and Google are hiring TPMs to manage AI program delivery. Notion must offer competitive comp to retain TPMs who can manage cross-functional AI programs at product scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $230K base and $330K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Technical Program Manager role. I manage the cross-functional AI rollout program for Notion's workspace — coordinating ML, platform, product, and enterprise teams. TPMs who can manage AI program delivery at workspace scale are rare. I have competing offers from [Google TPM at $375K TC / Stripe TPM at $365K TC / Figma TPM at $355K TC]. Technical program managers with AI product delivery expertise are in exceptional demand." Accept at $202K+ base and $270K+ RSUs.
