**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Epic Games protect one of the most targeted gaming ecosystems in the world. Fortnite's 350M+ accounts, virtual currency (V-Bucks), and cosmetic marketplace make it a massive target for account takeover, fraud, and virtual item theft. The Epic Games Store handles payment processing and DRM for millions of game purchases. Unreal Engine's code distribution must be secured against unauthorized access and IP theft. Epic also faces the unique challenge of anti-cheat security — preventing cheating in Fortnite while respecting user privacy (unlike kernel-level approaches). The security team at Epic spans application security, account protection, payment fraud prevention, platform security, and anti-cheat engineering. Epic's high-profile legal battles (Apple, Google) have also elevated the importance of security and compliance functions. [Source: Epic Games Security, Fortnite Account Protection 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Epic Security Engineer = Google L4 Security = CrowdStrike Senior Security

**Global Levers**

1. **350M+ Account Protection:** "Epic manages 350M+ Fortnite accounts with V-Bucks virtual currency. Securing this identity and payment system at scale requires specialized expertise in identity security and financial fraud prevention."
2. **Epic Games Store Security:** "The EGS processes millions of game purchases and manages DRM for thousands of titles. Platform security engineering at this scale requires deep expertise in payment security and content protection."
3. **Anti-Cheat Without Kernel Access:** "Epic's approach to anti-cheat (Easy Anti-Cheat) works without kernel-level access — a harder technical challenge than ring-0 approaches. Security engineers who can detect cheating at the application level are solving a fundamentally harder problem."
4. **Legal/Regulatory Awareness:** "Epic's legal landscape (Apple lawsuit, FTC settlement) has elevated security and compliance requirements. Security engineers who understand regulatory compliance in addition to technical security are highly valued."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $305K TC — $210K base, $180K equity/4yr, and 15% bonus. Securing Fortnite's 350M+ accounts, the EGS payment platform, and Unreal Engine IP requires specialized gaming security expertise." Accept at $145K+ equity with $195K+ base.
