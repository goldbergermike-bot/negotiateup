### Solutions Architect | Epic Games Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Equity (Private) + Bonus | Fortnite + Unreal Engine Dual Revenue

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Private Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Cary NC | $160K–$225K | $80K–$210K | 15% | $225K–$350K |
| Seattle | $170K–$235K | $90K–$225K | 15% | $240K–$370K |
| London | £62K–£98K | £25K–£55K | 15% | £95K–£158K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Epic Games design the technical architecture connecting Fortnite's live-service platform, Unreal Engine's developer tools, Epic Online Services, and the Epic Games Store. The SA role at Epic is unique because the product portfolio spans consumer gaming (Fortnite), developer tools (Unreal), platform services (Epic Online Services — matchmaking, identity, voice chat as a service), and e-commerce (EGS). SAs must understand game engine architecture, cloud infrastructure, real-time networking, and platform economics. Epic Online Services — which offers matchmaking, cross-platform identity, and voice chat to any developer — is a growing platform play that requires SA expertise to design and scale.

**Level Mapping:** Epic SA = Google L4-L5 Solutions = AWS Solutions Architect III-IV

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Product Architecture Scope:** "I'll be designing solutions across Fortnite, Unreal Engine, Epic Online Services, and EGS — four distinct products with different architectural requirements. This multi-product scope exceeds typical SA roles."
2. **Epic Online Services Growth:** "Epic Online Services (EOS) is a platform play that provides matchmaking, identity, and voice chat to any developer. Architecting this B2B platform service is a strategic growth initiative."
3. **Cross-Industry Unreal Solutions:** "Unreal Engine is used across gaming, film, automotive, and architecture. SA roles that span these industries have unique breadth."
4. **Private Equity at SA Level:** "I want the equity sized with an illiquidity premium. SA roles at Epic have strategic importance that justifies $190K+ equity/4yr."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $330K TC — $220K base, $195K equity/4yr, and 15% bonus. My architecture experience across [relevant domains] maps directly to Epic's multi-product platform needs." Accept at $160K+ equity with $205K+ base.
