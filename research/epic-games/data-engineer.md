**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Epic Games build the data infrastructure that processes telemetry from 350M+ Fortnite players, millions of Unreal Engine developers, and Epic Games Store transactions. Fortnite alone generates massive telemetry — every match, every item purchase, every creative mode interaction produces events that must be ingested, processed, and made available for analytics in near-real-time. The data platform supports critical decisions: matchmaking optimization, content scheduling, monetization analytics, anti-cheat detection, and Unreal Engine usage analytics. Epic's data infrastructure spans both Fortnite's real-time gaming telemetry and the Epic Games Store's e-commerce data, creating a diverse and technically challenging data engineering environment.
