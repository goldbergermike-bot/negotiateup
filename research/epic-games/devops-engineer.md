### DevOps Engineer | Epic Games Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Equity (Private) + Bonus | Fortnite + Unreal Engine Dual Revenue

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Private Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Cary NC | $145K–$205K | $60K–$180K | 15% | $192K–$300K |
| Seattle | $155K–$215K | $70K–$195K | 15% | $208K–$320K |
| London | £55K–£85K | £20K–£45K | 10–15% | £80K–£132K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Epic Games maintain the infrastructure that powers Fortnite's massive live-service platform (handling millions of concurrent players), Unreal Engine's build and distribution systems, and the Epic Games Store. Fortnite's infrastructure is among the most demanding in gaming — the game has hosted events with 10M+ concurrent players, requiring autoscaling capabilities that rival the largest web platforms. Epic's build infrastructure for Unreal Engine is equally demanding — the engine's codebase is massive, and builds must be compiled across multiple platforms (PC, console, mobile). Epic's infrastructure team manages both cloud and on-premise systems, with significant AWS footprint. The DevOps function is critical to maintaining Fortnite's uptime during major events (concerts, crossover events, season launches) that drive hundreds of millions in revenue.

**Level Mapping:** Epic DevOps = Google L3-L4 SRE = Amazon L5-L6 SysDE

**Global Levers**

1. **Fortnite Event Scale:** "Fortnite has hosted events with 10M+ concurrent players. The infrastructure autoscaling required for these events is among the most demanding in the industry."
2. **Unreal Engine Build System:** "Building and distributing Unreal Engine across multiple platforms requires a massive CI/CD infrastructure. This build system is more complex than most companies' entire infrastructure."
3. **AWS At Scale:** "Epic is one of AWS's largest gaming customers. DevOps engineers who can optimize this cloud spend have direct cost-savings impact measured in millions."
4. **Live-Service Zero-Downtime:** "Fortnite generates revenue every second it's online. Zero-downtime deployment capability is essential, and my experience with [blue-green/canary/rolling] deployments directly applies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $280K TC — $200K base, $160K equity/4yr, and 15% bonus. Fortnite-scale infrastructure requires specialized DevOps skills — 10M+ concurrent players, zero-downtime deployments, and massive cloud optimization." Accept at $130K+ equity with $185K+ base.
