**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Epic Games lead teams building Fortnite (one of the highest-grossing games ever), Unreal Engine (the dominant AAA engine), and Epic's platform services. Epic's EM role is technically demanding — in a company where the CEO writes engine code, engineering managers must maintain deep technical credibility. EMs at Epic manage teams that ship to hundreds of millions of players (Fortnite) or millions of developers (Unreal), creating enormous scope and impact. The private equity component at the EM level is substantial, with IPO upside potential. Epic's Cary NC headquarters means EMs enjoy exceptional real purchasing power compared to coastal counterparts. The culture rewards technical managers who can balance innovation velocity with product stability. [Source: Epic Games EM Framework 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Epic EM = Google L5-L6 Manager = Meta M1-M2 = Unity EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Technical EM Culture:** "Epic's engineering culture is deeply technical — Tim Sweeney codes on the engine. As EM, I need to maintain technical credibility while managing people and delivery. This dual requirement is more demanding than pure people-management EM roles."
2. **Fortnite/Unreal Team Impact:** "Managing a team on [Fortnite/Unreal] means owning delivery for products that impact hundreds of millions of users and generate billions in revenue."
3. **Private Equity at EM Level:** "EM-level equity grants at Epic are substantial. I want the grant sized with an IPO premium — $300K+ over 4 years — given the illiquidity of private stock."
4. **Retention During Growth:** "Epic is still growing rapidly. As EM, I'm responsible for retaining talent during competitive market conditions where FAANG companies are actively recruiting from Epic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $460K TC — $255K base, $320K equity/4yr, and 20% bonus. Managing at Epic requires both technical depth and leadership excellence, and my experience at [company] directly transfers to Epic's most critical teams." Accept at $280K+ equity with $240K+ base.
