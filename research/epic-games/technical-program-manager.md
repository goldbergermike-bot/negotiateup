**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Epic Games coordinate the delivery of Fortnite seasonal launches, Unreal Engine major releases, Epic Games Store feature rollouts, and cross-product integration programs. Fortnite's seasonal cadence is one of the most demanding delivery schedules in gaming — each season introduces new gameplay features, battle pass content, crossover events (Marvel, Star Wars, etc.), and live events that must be orchestrated across engineering, art, design, QA, and marketing. Unreal Engine releases (UE5 point releases, major feature drops) coordinate across thousands of external developers who depend on the engine for their own products. TPMs at Epic must be technically deep — understanding real-time rendering, distributed systems, and game development pipelines to effectively manage these programs.

**Level Mapping:** Epic TPM = Google L4-L5 TPM = Amazon L6 TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Fortnite Season Launch Coordination:** "Fortnite season launches are among the highest-stakes delivery events in gaming — new gameplay, content, and live events must be perfectly coordinated across dozens of teams. My program management experience with [similar complex launches] directly transfers."
2. **Unreal Engine Release Impact:** "Unreal Engine releases impact thousands of external developers and studios. Managing these releases requires coordinating with both internal teams and a massive external developer ecosystem."
3. **Cross-Product Programs:** "Programs that span Fortnite, Unreal, and EGS require navigating different team cultures, technical stacks, and delivery cadences. This cross-product coordination is complex and valuable."
4. **Private Equity TPM Value:** "TPMs who successfully deliver complex programs protect and grow Epic's revenue. I want the equity grant to reflect this delivery impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $295K TC — $205K base, $170K equity/4yr, and 15% bonus. Coordinating Fortnite season launches and Unreal Engine releases is among the most complex program management work in gaming." Accept at $135K+ equity with $190K+ base.
