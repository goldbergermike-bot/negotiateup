**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Epic Games work on some of the most visible and impactful UX challenges in gaming. Fortnite's UI/UX is used by 350M+ registered players — the item shop, battle pass progression, social features, and creative mode interfaces are all product design-driven. The Unreal Engine Editor UX serves millions of developers — a complex 3D development environment that must be both powerful and approachable. Epic Games Store designers compete directly with Steam's decades-old UX patterns, designing the store, library, and social features for a marketplace challenging the dominant platform. Each product area presents unique design challenges: Fortnite is consumer-entertainment; Unreal is professional-creative-tools; EGS is e-commerce. Epic's design function has grown significantly, but remains smaller than engineering, giving each designer outsized influence. [Source: Epic Games Design Team 2025]
