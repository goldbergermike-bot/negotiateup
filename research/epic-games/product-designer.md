### Product Designer | Epic Games Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Equity (Private) + Bonus | Fortnite + Unreal Engine Dual Revenue

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Private Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Cary NC | $130K–$185K | $50K–$160K | 15% | $175K–$275K |
| Seattle | $140K–$195K | $60K–$175K | 15% | $190K–$295K |
| London | £50K–£80K | £18K–£40K | 10–15% | £73K–£125K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Epic Games work on some of the most visible and impactful UX challenges in gaming. Fortnite's UI/UX is used by 350M+ registered players — the item shop, battle pass progression, social features, and creative mode interfaces are all product design-driven. The Unreal Engine Editor UX serves millions of developers — a complex 3D development environment that must be both powerful and approachable. Epic Games Store designers compete directly with Steam's decades-old UX patterns, designing the store, library, and social features for a marketplace challenging the dominant platform. Each product area presents unique design challenges: Fortnite is consumer-entertainment; Unreal is professional-creative-tools; EGS is e-commerce. Epic's design function has grown significantly, but remains smaller than engineering, giving each designer outsized influence. [Source: Epic Games Design Team 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Epic Product Designer = Google L4 UX = Apple ICT3 Design

**Global Levers**

1. **350M+ Player Interface:** If on Fortnite: "I'm designing interfaces used by 350M+ players. The scale of user impact is enormous — every design decision is experienced by more users than most products will ever have."
2. **Developer Tools UX Complexity:** If on Unreal: "Designing a 3D development environment that serves both beginners and industry veterans is one of the hardest UX challenges in software. My experience in [creative tools/complex UX] directly applies."
3. **EGS Competitive Positioning:** If on Epic Games Store: "I'm designing the UX for a platform competing directly with Steam. Every usability improvement helps Epic capture market share in a $50B+ market."
4. **Equity Upside for Design Impact:** "My design work directly influences conversion rates, engagement, and revenue. The equity grant should reflect this revenue impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $255K TC — $180K base, $145K equity/4yr, and 15% bonus. My gaming design portfolio demonstrates direct revenue impact through UX optimization at scale." Accept at $110K+ equity with $165K+ base.
