### Software Engineer | Epic Games Global Negotiation Guide

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Private Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Cary NC | $140K–$195K | $60K–$200K | 15% | $180K–$305K |
| Seattle | $150K–$205K | $70K–$210K | 15% | $192K–$320K |
| London | £55K–£85K | £20K–£50K | 10–15% | £80K–£130K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Epic Games (private, $30B+ valuation, Cary NC) operates a dual revenue engine: Fortnite (one of the highest-grossing games ever, with $5B+ cumulative revenue) and Unreal Engine (the dominant AAA game engine, also used in film, automotive, and enterprise). Epic's comp model includes base + private equity + bonus (15%). The equity component is in private stock — meaningful if Epic IPOs but illiquid in the near term. Epic has been aggressive in comp since 2020, competing directly with FAANG for engineering talent, particularly in North Carolina where Epic is the dominant tech employer. The Cary NC office benefits from lower cost of living while offering competitive coastal comp, making the real purchasing power exceptional. Epic also has a growing Seattle presence for engineers who prefer Pacific Northwest lifestyle. [Source: Epic Games Careers, Revenue Estimates 2025-2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Private Equity Upside Framing:** "Epic's $30B+ valuation makes the equity meaningful, but it's illiquid. I'd like a larger equity grant to compensate for the liquidity discount — or a higher base to increase the guaranteed portion of comp."
2. **Dual Revenue Engine:** "Epic has two massive revenue streams — Fortnite and Unreal Engine. As an engineer, my work may touch both, creating dual revenue impact that justifies above-market comp."
3. **Cary NC Cost-of-Living Advantage:** If based in Cary: "Epic pays coastal-competitive comp in a market with 40-50% lower cost of living than SF or NYC. I want to ensure my offer reflects coastal benchmarks, not Raleigh-Durham local market rates."
4. **Epic Games Store Strategy:** "Epic's investment in the Epic Games Store is a strategic priority. Engineers building marketplace, discovery, and transaction infrastructure are working on Epic's third major revenue stream."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "I'm targeting $280K TC — $185K base, $180K equity/4yr, and 15% bonus. Epic's dual revenue engine means high impact per engineer, and I want the equity grant to reflect the IPO upside potential." Epic will counter at $120K–$150K equity. Push to $160K+ with a sign-on of $15K–$25K. Accept if TC exceeds $250K.
