### Staff Software Engineer | Epic Games Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Equity (Private) + Bonus | Fortnite + Unreal Engine Dual Revenue

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Private Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Cary NC | $200K–$265K | $180K–$400K | 15–20% | $330K–$530K |
| Seattle | $210K–$275K | $200K–$420K | 15–20% | $350K–$555K |
| London | £85K–£125K | £50K–£95K | 15% | £145K–£240K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Epic Games are principal-level architects who define the technical direction for entire product areas — Fortnite's live-service platform, Unreal Engine's core systems, Epic Online Services, or the Epic Games Store. At the Staff level, equity grants are substantial ($180K-$400K/4yr in private stock), and the IPO upside potential makes this one of the most lucrative IC positions in gaming. Staff SWEs at Epic operate with exceptional autonomy — Tim Sweeney (CEO/CTO) is himself a deeply technical engineer, and the culture rewards technical ambition. Staff engineers on the Unreal Engine team are building technology that defines real-time rendering for the next decade; those on Fortnite are architecting the world's largest live-service platform. Few positions in gaming combine this level of technical challenge, business impact, and compensation. [Source: Epic Games Staff Engineering 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Epic Staff SWE = Google L5-L6 = Meta E5-E6 = Valve Principal Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **IPO Trajectory Premium:** "Epic's $30B+ valuation positions the company for an eventual IPO. Staff-level equity grants have the potential for 2-3x returns on an IPO. I want the equity sized to reflect this trajectory — $350K+ over 4 years."
2. **Cross-Product Architecture:** "At the Staff level, I'll be influencing architecture decisions that span Fortnite, Unreal Engine, and Epic Online Services. My technical direction impacts multiple billion-dollar revenue streams."
3. **Tim Sweeney's Technical Culture:** "Epic's technical culture — led by one of the most technical CEOs in gaming — means Staff engineers have real influence on product and technical direction. This empowerment is unique and valuable."
4. **FAANG Staff Benchmarking:** "Google L5-L6 and Meta E5-E6 in Seattle are $450K-$600K TC with fully liquid stock. Epic's private equity needs to be sized generously to compete — or base needs to be higher."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $500K TC — $260K base, $380K equity/4yr, and 20% bonus. At the Staff level, I'm defining Epic's technical architecture across multiple billion-dollar products. My FAANG alternatives are at $500K+ with liquid equity." Accept at $320K+ equity with $250K+ base and sign-on of $30K–$50K.
