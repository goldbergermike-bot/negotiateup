**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Epic Games are the primary technical drivers across Fortnite, Unreal Engine, and the Epic Games Store. At the Senior level, Epic's equity grants become substantial — $100K-$260K over 4 years in private stock that has meaningful IPO upside. Epic's engineering culture emphasizes technical excellence and ownership — Senior SWEs are expected to drive architecture decisions, mentor junior engineers, and ship features that impact hundreds of millions of players (Fortnite) or millions of developers (Unreal Engine). The Cary NC headquarters offers exceptional real purchasing power — Senior engineers earning $350K+ TC in Cary have the purchasing power of $500K+ in San Francisco. Seattle-based Senior engineers have access to the broader Pacific Northwest tech ecosystem while working on gaming's most interesting problems. [Source: Epic Games Engineering Levels 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Epic Senior SWE = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Unity Senior SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Purchasing Power Arbitrage:** If Cary-based: "My $350K TC in Cary has real purchasing power equivalent to $500K+ in SF. But I'm still going to negotiate as if I'm in a coastal market — Epic's comp should reflect the talent market, not the local cost of living."
2. **Fortnite Scale Impact:** If working on Fortnite: "Fortnite has 350M+ registered accounts. As a Senior SWE, my code ships to one of the largest player bases in gaming history."
3. **Unreal Engine Ecosystem:** If working on Unreal: "Every improvement I make to Unreal Engine impacts millions of developers and thousands of shipped titles. The multiplier effect of engine work is unmatched."
4. **IPO Upside Negotiation:** "Epic's equity is private and illiquid. I'd like either a larger equity grant (to compensate for the liquidity discount) or a higher base (to increase the guaranteed portion). The standard approach is a 20-30% illiquidity premium on the equity grant."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $360K TC — $220K base, $240K equity/4yr, and 15% bonus. Epic's private equity has IPO upside, but I want the guaranteed components to be strong. My FAANG competing offers at [X] provide full liquidity." Push equity to $200K+ or base to $210K+. Accept if TC exceeds $330K.
