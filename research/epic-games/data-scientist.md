**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Epic Games leverage one of the richest player behavior datasets in gaming — 350M+ Fortnite accounts generating detailed behavioral data across battle royale, creative mode, social interactions, and the item shop. DS roles at Epic span player engagement optimization, matchmaking modeling, content recommendation, churn prediction, and monetization analytics. The Fortnite DS team has direct influence on some of the most consequential live-service decisions in gaming — from battle pass pricing to seasonal event timing. Data scientists on the Unreal Engine team analyze developer usage patterns to optimize the engine's tooling and feature prioritization. Epic's investment in DS has grown as the company increasingly uses data to drive product decisions across all three products. [Source: Epic Games Analytics, DS Team 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Epic Senior Data Scientist = Google L4 DS = Meta IC4 DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Fortnite Behavioral Data Uniqueness:** "Fortnite's dataset captures player behavior across multiple game modes — battle royale, creative, social. This behavioral richness enables DS work that isn't possible with simpler gaming datasets."
2. **Live-Service Revenue Impact:** "Every DS recommendation I make — content timing, pricing optimization, matchmaking tuning — directly impacts Fortnite's revenue. The feedback loop between my models and revenue is immediate and measurable."
3. **Cross-Product Analytics:** "Working across Fortnite, Unreal Engine, and EGS means I can contribute to multiple product areas and demonstrate cross-domain impact."
4. **Private Equity Upside:** "I want the equity grant sized generously given the IPO potential. $180K+ over 4 years with the understanding that IPO could significantly increase this value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $305K TC — $210K base, $175K equity/4yr, and 15% bonus. My expertise in player behavior modeling and live-service analytics directly maps to Fortnite's most critical DS workstreams." Accept at $145K+ equity with $195K+ base.
