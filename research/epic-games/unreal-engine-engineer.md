**Negotiation DNA**

This is Epic Games' signature engineering role — the Unreal Engine Engineer. You are building the world's most widely-used AAA game engine, powering thousands of games, Hollywood visual effects (The Mandalorian, Fortnite concerts), architectural visualization, automotive design, and military simulation. Unreal Engine is Epic's strategic moat — it generates hundreds of millions in licensing revenue AND drives developers to the Epic Games Store ecosystem. Epic is private ($30B+ valuation), meaning equity grants are in private company stock that may have significant upside if Epic IPOs or if secondary market valuations increase. Unreal Engine 5 represents the largest engine overhaul in gaming history, with Nanite, Lumen, MetaHuman, and World Partition redefining real-time graphics. Engineers on the Unreal team are building technology that defines the future of interactive entertainment and beyond. [Source: Epic Games Engineering, Unreal Engine 5 Architecture 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Epic Senior Engine Engineer = Google L4-L5 = Meta E4-E5 = Unity Principal Engineer

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Unreal Engine Engineer works on technology that transcends gaming:
- **Rendering Pipeline:** Building Nanite (virtualized geometry) and Lumen (global illumination) — technologies that define the state of the art in real-time rendering
- **Cross-Industry Platform:** Unreal Engine is used in gaming, film (virtual production), automotive, architecture, and defense — your code ships across every industry
- **Developer Platform:** Designing APIs, tools, and workflows used by millions of developers worldwide
- **MetaHuman/Digital Humans:** Engineering the real-time digital human pipeline used in games, film, and enterprise applications

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Industry Revenue Impact:** "Unreal Engine isn't just a game engine — it's a platform powering film, automotive, architecture, and defense. The TAM of my work extends far beyond gaming, and the licensing revenue reflects that breadth."
2. **Private Equity Upside:** "Epic's $30B+ valuation makes the equity component meaningful. If Epic IPOs at $50B+, my equity grant has 60%+ upside. I want the initial equity grant sized to reflect this potential."
3. **Engine Scarcity Premium (15-30%):** "Game engine engineers are the most specialized and scarce talent pool in graphics engineering. Fewer than 1,000 engineers globally have production Unreal/game-engine experience at this level."
4. **Unreal Engine 5 Flagship Timing:** "UE5 is the most significant engine release in a decade. Joining now means contributing to technology that will define the industry for the next 10 years. This timing premium should be reflected in comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the world's most-used AAA engine platform. I'd like $240K base, $280K equity/4yr, and 20% bonus. Unreal Engine generates hundreds of millions in licensing revenue, and my engineering work directly expands this revenue across gaming, film, and enterprise. Competing offers from Unity, NVIDIA, and FAANG graphics teams are at [X]." Epic will counter at $220K–$250K equity. Accept at $250K+ equity with sign-on of $30K–$50K.
