### Product Manager | Epic Games Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Equity (Private) + Bonus | Fortnite + Unreal Engine Dual Revenue

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Private Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Cary NC | $155K–$220K | $80K–$220K | 15% | $215K–$350K |
| Seattle | $165K–$230K | $90K–$240K | 15% | $230K–$370K |
| London | £60K–£95K | £25K–£55K | 15% | £92K–£155K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Epic Games own product strategy for some of the most influential products in gaming. PMs on Fortnite manage the live-service strategy for a game with 350M+ registered accounts — including battle pass design, seasonal events, creative mode, and the metaverse-adjacent social features that make Fortnite more than just a game. PMs on Unreal Engine manage the developer experience for the world's most-used AAA engine — marketplace, documentation, tooling, and feature prioritization. PMs on the Epic Games Store manage the platform's growth strategy in direct competition with Steam. Each product area presents unique PM challenges: Fortnite is consumer-facing and entertainment-driven; Unreal is developer-facing and tools-driven; EGS is marketplace-driven. Epic's private equity makes the comp package compelling with IPO upside. [Source: Epic Games Product Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Epic PM = Google L5-L6 PM = Meta IC5 PM = Valve PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Product PM Opportunity:** "Epic has three major products with distinct PM challenges. I want to ensure my placement is on the product that maximizes my impact and comp — Fortnite (consumer), Unreal (developer), or EGS (marketplace)."
2. **Fortnite Revenue Attribution:** If on Fortnite: "Fortnite's live-service revenue is directly attributable to PM decisions — battle pass design, item shop strategy, seasonal events. My decisions have billion-dollar impact."
3. **Unreal Engine Developer Experience:** If on Unreal: "The developer experience of Unreal Engine determines Epic's engine market share. Every developer I retain or attract contributes to Epic's ecosystem value."
4. **Private Equity Sizing:** "Since the equity is illiquid, I want a larger grant to compensate. The standard illiquidity discount is 20-30%, so my equity grant should be sized accordingly."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $330K TC — $215K base, $200K equity/4yr, and 15% bonus. My PM experience in [live-service/developer tools/marketplace] directly maps to Epic's highest-priority product areas." Accept at $170K+ equity with $200K+ base.
