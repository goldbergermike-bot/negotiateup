**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Epic Games work on some of the most innovative applications of AI in the gaming and entertainment industry. On the Unreal Engine side: MetaHuman (AI-powered digital human creation), procedural content generation, AI-assisted animation, and intelligent tooling for developers. On the Fortnite side: matchmaking ML, anti-cheat detection, player behavior prediction, and content recommendation. Epic has also invested heavily in generative AI for game development — AI-powered texture generation, dialogue writing, level design assistance, and code completion for Unreal Engine. The combination of Unreal Engine's cross-industry reach (gaming, film, automotive, architecture) and Fortnite's massive player base creates ML/AI challenges that span both consumer entertainment and developer tooling.
