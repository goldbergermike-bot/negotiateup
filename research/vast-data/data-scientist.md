### Data Scientist | Vast Data Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Secondary Liquidity + Base | AI Data Platform | $1B Secondary at $25B Valuation | Data & Analytics Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $150K–$185K | $25K–$55K | 8–12% | $192K–$268K |
| Tel Aviv | ₪490K–₪605K | $20K–$48K | 8–12% | $178K–$250K |
| Remote US | $140K–$175K | $25K–$55K | 8–12% | $182K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Vast Data operate at the core of the company's value proposition: the universal data platform for AI. You are not just analyzing data — you are building the analytics, benchmarking, and performance intelligence that proves Vast Data's platform eliminates the data bottleneck for AI training. At a $25B valuation, your work directly informs product decisions, customer success stories, and the metrics that drive the IPO narrative. Data Scientists with expertise in storage performance, large-scale data systems, or AI/ML workloads are in exceptionally high demand.

**Level Mapping:**

**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, allowing employees to sell shares for real cash before an IPO. For Data Scientists evaluating offers, this means you should not apply the typical 50–70% discount that candidates use for illiquid startup equity. Vast Data equity has a proven market.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. As a Data Scientist, I quantify value for a living — and the secondary market data tells me these shares are worth negotiating hard for."*

Data Scientists should also model their own comp scenarios using the $25B valuation as a floor. If Vast Data reaches $40B–$50B at IPO (a reasonable scenario given growth), your share grant appreciates 60–100%. Factor this into your negotiation by showing you've done the math — recruiters respect candidates who treat comp analytically.

**Global Levers**

1. **Analytical Comp Modeling:** "I've modeled my comp under three scenarios: current $25B valuation, a $40B IPO, and a $50B IPO. At [X shares], my equity is worth $Y–$Z across those scenarios. I'd like to anchor my negotiation to the $25B secondary floor."
2. **Competing Data Science Offer:** "I have a Data Scientist offer from [Company] at $250K total comp with liquid equity. Vast Data's upside is compelling, but I need a share count that makes the expected value calculation work at the $25B baseline."
3. **Research and Publication Rights:** "I'd like the ability to publish research and present at conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, VLDB) based on non-proprietary aspects of my work. This is a non-monetary benefit that matters to me and helps Vast Data's brand."
4. **Tel Aviv Equity Parity:** "For the Tel Aviv-based role, I'd expect equity to be benchmarked at US levels, since the secondary market is global and the shares have the same value regardless of my location."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "As a Data Scientist with expertise in large-scale data systems and AI workloads, I'm targeting $250K–$268K total comp at Vast Data. I'd like the base at $180K, a share grant of [X shares] at the $25B valuation, a 12% bonus target, and a $20K signing bonus. I've modeled the equity using the secondary as a floor — at the $25B valuation, [X shares] is worth $Y, with significant upside at IPO. My accept-at floor is $220K total comp with [Z shares] minimum. Below that, the liquid offer from [Company] at $250K is the better expected-value play."
