**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Vast Data lead the teams building the universal data platform for AI — the storage infrastructure that eliminates data bottlenecks for the largest AI training workloads in the world. At a $25B valuation, Vast Data is scaling rapidly and needs engineering leaders who can hire, retain, and direct high-caliber teams through the critical pre-IPO growth phase. Your negotiation leverage stems from the fact that great engineering managers are scarcer than great individual contributors, and your ability to scale a team directly impacts revenue and valuation growth.

**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, enabling employees to sell shares for cash before any IPO. As an Engineering Manager, you need to understand that this liquidity changes the calculus of your comp negotiation entirely. You are not gambling on a startup — you are joining a company where equity has a proven cash value.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. As a manager responsible for building and retaining a team, I also need to understand the secondary sale policies so I can speak credibly to candidates I'm hiring about the value of their equity."*

Managers should also negotiate for insight into the equity pool they'll have for their team. Understanding the team's equity budget gives you leverage to attract talent and demonstrates that Vast Data values your role as a leader, not just an individual contributor.

**Global Levers**

1. **Team Equity Budget Visibility:** "As an Engineering Manager, I'll be hiring and retaining engineers. I need visibility into the equity budget for my team, including the ability to allocate refresh grants. This directly affects my ability to build the team Vast Data needs."
2. **Management Premium Over IC:** "I'm moving from a senior IC role where I had $X total comp with no management overhead. The management premium should be reflected in both base and equity — I expect at least a 10–15% premium over an equivalent-level IC offer."
3. **Competing Public Company Offer:** "I have a management offer from [Public Company] at $340K total comp with liquid RSUs. Vast Data's equity upside is compelling, but I need the share count to bridge the liquidity gap. I'd like [X shares] at the $25B valuation."
4. **Relocation or Remote Flexibility:** "If the role requires relocation to New York, I'd expect a $30K–$50K relocation package. If it's remote-eligible, I want the equity component to remain at New York-level benchmarks."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an Engineering Manager role at Vast Data, I'm targeting $350K–$375K total comp. I'd like the base at $240K, a share grant of [X shares] at the $25B valuation, a 15% bonus target, and a $40K signing bonus. I have a competing offer from [Public Company] at $340K with liquid RSUs, so the equity math needs to work — and the secondary market at $25B gives me confidence it can. My accept-at floor is $300K total comp with [Y shares]. Below that, the public company offer is the safer choice."
