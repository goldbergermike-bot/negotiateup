### Security Engineer | Vast Data Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Secondary Liquidity + Base | AI Data Platform | $1B Secondary at $25B Valuation | Security & Compliance Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $155K–$195K | $30K–$60K | 8–12% | $202K–$282K |
| Tel Aviv | ₪510K–₪640K | $25K–$52K | 8–12% | $188K–$262K |
| Remote US | $145K–$185K | $30K–$60K | 8–12% | $192K–$270K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Vast Data protect the universal data platform for AI — a platform that stores and processes some of the most valuable and sensitive datasets in the world. AI training data is a strategic asset, and the security of that data is non-negotiable for enterprise customers. At a $25B valuation, Vast Data is heading toward IPO, which means SOX compliance, SOC 2 audits, and enterprise security certifications become critical. Security engineers who can navigate both product security (securing the platform itself) and corporate security (preparing for public company compliance) are in extremely high demand.

**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, allowing employees to sell shares for real cash before any IPO. For Security Engineers, who are essential to protecting the company's valuation from breaches, compliance failures, and data loss, the secondary market validates that your work has a directly quantifiable financial impact.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. As a Security Engineer, I protect the very assets that underpin the $25B valuation. A single breach could erase billions in value — my equity should reflect the magnitude of what I'm safeguarding."*

Security engineers should also negotiate for certification reimbursement (CISSP, OSCP, CISM) and access to security tooling budgets. These are high-value, low-cost perks that signal the company takes security seriously.

**Global Levers**

1. **Security Criticality Premium:** "Security is existential for a data platform company heading toward IPO. I expect my comp to reflect the criticality of the role — a base at the top of the band ($190K+) and a share count that acknowledges I'm protecting a $25B asset."
2. **Certification and Training Budget:** "I'd like a $7K annual budget for security certifications (CISSP, OSCP, CISM), training, and conference attendance (Black Hat, DEF CON, RSA). This is standard for security roles at companies of this scale."
3. **Competing Security Offer:** "I have a security engineering offer from [Company] at $265K total comp. Vast Data's equity upside and the AI data platform mission are compelling, but the share count needs to bring total comp to $270K–$282K at the $25B valuation."
4. **IPO-Readiness Bonus:** "If I'm helping prepare Vast Data for SOX compliance and public company security requirements, I'd like a milestone bonus of $15K–$25K upon successful completion of the IPO security readiness program."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "As a Security Engineer with experience in data platform security and compliance, I'm targeting $265K–$282K total comp at Vast Data. I'd like the base at $190K, a share grant of [X shares] at the $25B valuation, a 10% bonus target, a $25K signing bonus, and a $7K annual security certification budget. The secondary market at $25B means I'm valuing the equity seriously. My accept-at floor is $235K total comp with [Y shares] minimum. Below that, the competing security offer at [Company] with liquid comp and a clear security mandate is the safer choice."
