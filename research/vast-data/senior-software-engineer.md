**Negotiation DNA**

At the Senior Software Engineer level, you are expected to own major subsystems of Vast Data's universal storage platform — the infrastructure that eliminates data bottlenecks for AI training at the world's largest scale. With the company valued at $25B and proven secondary liquidity, your negotiation position is exceptionally strong. Senior engineers at this stage of a company's growth trajectory often capture the most equity upside, as they join after product-market fit but before IPO.

**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, allowing employees to sell shares for real cash before an IPO. This fundamentally changes how you should evaluate the equity portion of your offer. Unlike typical pre-IPO startups where equity is speculative paper, Vast Data shares have a proven liquid market.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. At my level, equity is the majority of my upside. I want a share count that reflects both the liquidity premium and my seniority."*

As a Senior Engineer, equity should represent 25–40% of your total comp. Push for a grant that reflects your impact on the platform. The secondary market means you can model realistic liquidity scenarios — not just hope for an IPO. Ask the recruiter directly: "What is the timeline and process for participating in secondary sales?" This signals sophistication and puts the liquidity conversation on the table.

**Global Levers**

1. **Share Count Anchored to $25B:** "I'd like my equity grant expressed in share count, benchmarked against the $25B secondary valuation. I want to ensure I'm getting a meaningful stake relative to the company's proven market value."
2. **Competing Offer with Liquid Equity:** "I have an offer from a public company at $290K total comp with fully liquid RSUs. To make Vast Data competitive, I need either a higher share count to offset the liquidity risk or confirmation of secondary sale eligibility within the first year."
3. **Accelerated Vesting or Refresh:** "Given my seniority and the pace of Vast Data's growth, I'd like to discuss a three-year vesting schedule instead of four, or a guaranteed Year 2 equity refresh to keep my comp competitive as the valuation grows."
4. **Tel Aviv Cost-of-Living Adjustment:** "For the Tel Aviv role, I'd expect the equity and bonus components to remain benchmarked to US-equivalent comp levels, with only the base adjusted for local market rates."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $290K–$315K total comp based on my experience and competing offers from public tech companies. I'd like the base at $210K with a share grant of [X shares] at the $25B valuation, plus a $30K signing bonus. The secondary liquidity makes Vast Data equity uniquely credible — I'm not discounting it like typical startup paper. My accept-at floor is $255K total comp with [Y shares] minimum. Below that, the liquid RSU offer from [Company] is more compelling."
