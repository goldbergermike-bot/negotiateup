**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, meaning employees were able to sell existing shares for real cash before any IPO. This is not speculative startup equity — there is a proven, liquid market for Vast Data shares. As a candidate, you should negotiate aggressively on share count, not just on paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. Other pre-IPO companies offer equity that may never be liquid, but Vast Data has already demonstrated a secondary market. I want my offer to reflect that proven liquidity."*

When negotiating, push for a specific number of shares rather than a dollar value of equity. Dollar values can be manipulated by adjusting the strike price or the valuation benchmark. Share count is concrete, and with the secondary market proven at $25B, you know what those shares are worth today — and potentially more at IPO.

**Global Levers**

1. **Share Count Over Dollar Value:** "I'd like to negotiate on share count rather than dollar value. Given the $25B secondary valuation, I can calculate the real worth myself — and I want to ensure my equity stake reflects my contribution to the platform."
2. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a competing offer from [Company] at $X total comp. Vast Data's equity upside is compelling, but I need the base and share count to bridge the gap so I'm not taking a discount to join."
3. **Signing Bonus to Bridge Year-One Gap:** "Since equity vesting typically has a one-year cliff, I'd like a signing bonus of $15K–$25K to bridge the first-year compensation gap compared to my current role."
4. **Remote Work Premium:** "If the role is based in New York but I'm working remotely, I'd expect the equity component to remain pegged to New York levels, since my output is location-independent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about Vast Data's mission to build the data platform for AI. Based on my research and competing offers in the $200K–$230K total comp range, I'd like to see the base move to $155K with a share grant of [X shares] based on the $25B secondary valuation, plus a $20K signing bonus. The secondary liquidity at $25B makes equity here uniquely valuable, and I want to make sure both sides recognize that. My accept-at floor is $190K total comp with a minimum of [Y shares]. Below that, I'd need to go with my competing offer."
