### Product Designer | Vast Data Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Secondary Liquidity + Base | AI Data Platform | $1B Secondary at $25B Valuation | Design Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $125K–$155K | $18K–$40K | 5–10% | $155K–$218K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Vast Data are responsible for making the most powerful data platform for AI intuitive, efficient, and beautiful. This is not consumer design — it is enterprise-grade design for infrastructure that serves AI engineers, data scientists, and platform teams at the largest organizations in the world. At a $25B valuation, Vast Data is investing in design to differentiate its platform in an increasingly competitive AI infrastructure market. Your leverage comes from the scarcity of designers who can operate at the intersection of complex data systems and user experience.

**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, allowing employees to sell shares for real cash. For designers, who are often offered smaller equity grants than engineers, the liquidity story is especially important: even a smaller grant has real, provable value when there's a liquid secondary market.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. As a designer, I know my equity grant may be smaller than engineering roles, but the liquidity means every share has proven value. I want to maximize my share count accordingly."*

Designers should also negotiate for visibility into how design impacts business metrics. If you can tie your work to customer acquisition, retention, or NPS improvements, you can make a stronger case for equity refreshes and bonuses down the line.

**Global Levers**

1. **Share Count Maximization:** "I understand design roles may receive smaller equity grants than engineering, but the secondary liquidity at $25B makes every share valuable. I'd like to push my share count to the top of the band — [X shares] — because I'm confident in the company's trajectory."
2. **Design Tool and Conference Budget:** "I'd like a $5K annual professional development budget for design tools, conferences, and courses. This is a small investment that significantly impacts my output and is standard at companies of this scale."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have an offer from [Company] at $200K total comp. Vast Data's mission is more compelling, but I need the numbers to work. Can we increase the base to $150K and add a $15K signing bonus?"
4. **Portfolio and Impact Visibility:** "I'd like to discuss how design impact is measured at Vast Data and how it ties to equity refreshes and promotions. Understanding the growth path is important to my decision."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the opportunity to design for the AI data platform at Vast Data. Based on my experience in enterprise infrastructure design and a competing offer at $200K total comp, I'm targeting $205K–$218K. I'd like the base at $150K, a share grant of [X shares] at the $25B valuation, an 8% bonus target, and a $15K signing bonus. The secondary market at $25B gives me confidence to weigh the equity seriously. My accept-at floor is $180K total comp with [Y shares]. Below that, the competing offer is more financially sound."
