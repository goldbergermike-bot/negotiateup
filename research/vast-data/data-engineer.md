### Data Engineer | Vast Data Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Secondary Liquidity + Base | AI Data Platform | $1B Secondary at $25B Valuation | Data Infrastructure Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $145K–$180K | $25K–$52K | 5–10% | $185K–$258K |
| Tel Aviv | ₪475K–₪590K | $20K–$45K | 5–10% | $172K–$240K |
| Remote US | $135K–$170K | $25K–$52K | 5–10% | $175K–$245K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Vast Data are building the pipelines, integrations, and data management layers of the universal data platform for AI. You are at the heart of the product — your work determines how efficiently AI training data flows from storage to compute, eliminating the bottleneck that makes Vast Data's platform valuable. At a $25B valuation, Data Engineers who understand large-scale data processing, distributed systems, and AI/ML data pipelines are among the most sought-after hires. Your negotiation leverage is rooted in the direct alignment between your work and the company's core value proposition.

**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, allowing employees to sell shares for real cash before an IPO. For Data Engineers, whose work is the core of the platform, the secondary liquidity validates that your contributions directly underpin a $25B market value.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. As a Data Engineer building the core data platform for AI, my work is literally the product. I want my equity stake to reflect how central my role is to the company's $25B valuation."*

Data Engineers should also ask about internal data access and tooling. At a data platform company, having the best internal data tools is both a productivity multiplier and a sign that the company practices what it preaches. Negotiate for access to the latest hardware and software stack.

**Global Levers**

1. **Core Product Equity Premium:** "As a Data Engineer, I'm building the core product — the data platform itself. This isn't a support function; it's the revenue-generating asset. I'd like my equity grant to be at the top of the engineering band: [X shares] at the $25B valuation."
2. **Competing Data Engineering Offer:** "I have a Data Engineer offer from [Company] at $240K total comp. Vast Data's equity upside is compelling, but I need the share count to bring total comp to $245K–$258K at the $25B baseline."
3. **Hardware and Tooling Budget:** "I'd like access to high-performance development hardware and a $3K annual budget for data engineering tools and conference attendance (Data Council, Spark Summit). This directly impacts my productivity."
4. **Tel Aviv Base Adjustment:** "For the Tel Aviv role, I understand the base will be denominated in ILS, but I'd like the equity and bonus to be benchmarked at US levels — the shares have the same global value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "As a Data Engineer with deep experience in large-scale data pipelines and distributed systems, I'm targeting $245K–$258K total comp at Vast Data. I'd like the base at $175K, a share grant of [X shares] at the $25B valuation, an 8% bonus target, and a $20K signing bonus. The secondary market means the equity has proven liquidity — I'm not discounting it. My accept-at floor is $215K total comp with [Y shares] minimum. Below that, the offer from [Company] at $240K with liquid equity is the economically rational choice."
