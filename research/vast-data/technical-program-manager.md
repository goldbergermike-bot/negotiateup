**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Vast Data orchestrate the cross-functional execution of the universal data platform for AI. You manage the intersection of engineering, product, design, and go-to-market teams to deliver platform capabilities on schedule and at the quality level demanded by AI customers. At a $25B valuation, Vast Data's execution velocity is critical — TPMs who can drive complex programs across distributed teams (New York, Tel Aviv, remote) are essential to maintaining the company's growth trajectory toward IPO.

**Level Mapping:**

**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, allowing employees to sell shares for real cash before an IPO. For TPMs, who bridge technical and business functions, understanding the secondary market is a differentiator: it signals that you think about compensation analytically and understand the company's capital structure.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. As a TPM driving cross-functional execution, my work directly impacts the company's ability to hit milestones that maintain and grow the $25B valuation. I want my equity grant to reflect the breadth and criticality of my programs."*

TPMs should also negotiate for clarity on scope and level. TPM titles can vary widely across companies — ensure that your offer explicitly states the programs you'll manage and the seniority of the teams you'll coordinate with.

**Global Levers**

1. **Program Scope Equity Adjustment:** "The programs I'll be managing — [specific programs] — span multiple engineering teams and directly impact customer delivery. I'd like the equity grant to reflect the scope: [X shares] at the $25B valuation, positioned at the top of the TPM band."
2. **Competing TPM Offer:** "I have a TPM offer from [Company] at $235K total comp. Vast Data's mission and equity upside are compelling, but I need the share count to bring total comp to $240K–$248K at the $25B baseline."
3. **Cross-Site Travel Compensation:** "If the role requires regular travel between New York and Tel Aviv offices, I'd like a travel stipend and flexible scheduling to accommodate the cross-site coordination demands."
4. **Milestone-Based Bonus:** "I'd like to discuss milestone-based bonuses tied to program delivery — for example, on-time delivery of [major release/feature] or successful customer deployment at scale. This aligns my incentives with execution outcomes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "As a Technical Program Manager with experience driving complex programs at [previous company], I'm targeting $235K–$248K total comp at Vast Data. I'd like the base at $170K, a share grant of [X shares] at the $25B valuation, a 10% bonus target, and a $20K signing bonus. The secondary liquidity at $25B means I'm treating the equity as near-liquid. My accept-at floor is $210K total comp with [Y shares] minimum. Below that, the TPM offer at [Company] with liquid RSUs is more straightforward."
