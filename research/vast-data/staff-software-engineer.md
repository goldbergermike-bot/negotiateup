### Staff Software Engineer | Vast Data Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Secondary Liquidity + Base | AI Data Platform | $1B Secondary at $25B Valuation | Staff-Level Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $225K–$280K | $60K–$120K | 10–15% | $312K–$435K |
| Tel Aviv | ₪735K–₪915K | $50K–$100K | 10–15% | $290K–$405K |
| Remote US | $215K–$270K | $60K–$120K | 10–15% | $300K–$420K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Engineers at Vast Data define the technical direction of the universal data platform for AI — you are architecting the storage layer that eliminates the bottleneck between massive AI training datasets and GPU clusters. At a $25B valuation with proven secondary liquidity, Staff-level hires are expected to be force multipliers: setting technical standards, mentoring teams, and making architectural decisions that scale the platform through IPO and beyond. Your negotiation leverage is at its peak because Vast Data needs Staff-level talent to execute on its trajectory from $25B to a potential $50B+ public market valuation.

**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, allowing employees to sell existing shares for real money. At the Staff level, equity is typically the largest component of total compensation, making the liquidity story critical to your negotiation.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. At Staff level, I'm optimizing for wealth creation, not just annual income. The secondary market means I can treat this equity like near-liquid compensation, and I expect my share count to reflect that."*

At Staff level, push hard on these equity-specific points: (1) Request a specific share count, not a dollar amount, because dollar amounts can be manipulated by changing the valuation benchmark. (2) Ask about secondary sale frequency — can you sell annually, quarterly, or on demand? (3) Negotiate for early exercise rights (if options) so you can start the capital gains clock immediately. (4) Request a written confirmation of secondary sale eligibility as part of your offer letter.

**Global Levers**

1. **Equity as Primary Comp Vehicle:** "At Staff level, I expect equity to be the primary driver of my total comp. I'd like a share grant of [X shares] based on the $25B valuation, with the expectation that secondary sales provide real liquidity. I'm not treating this as speculative equity — and my expectations reflect that."
2. **Title and Level Parity:** "I'm currently at Staff / L6 at [Company]. I need Vast Data to match my title and level explicitly, with comp that reflects both the internal band and external market for Staff engineers at $25B-valuation companies."
3. **Signing Bonus for Unvested Equity:** "I'm leaving behind $150K in unvested RSUs at [Current Company]. I need a signing bonus of $80K–$120K or an accelerated vesting schedule to make the transition whole."
4. **IPO Lockup Consideration:** "Given the secondary market, I'd like to discuss whether there's a lockup period post-IPO and how that affects my shares. If there's a standard 180-day lockup, I'd want additional shares to compensate for the illiquidity window."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a Staff Engineer role at a $25B AI infrastructure company with proven secondary liquidity, I'm targeting $400K–$435K total comp. I'd like the base at $270K, equity grant of [X shares] at the $25B valuation, a 15% bonus target, and a $100K signing bonus to cover my unvested equity at [Current Company]. The secondary market at $25B means I'm valuing this equity at near-face value, not at a startup discount. My accept-at floor is $350K total comp with [Y shares] minimum. Below that, I'd stay at my current company or accept the competing Staff offer from [Public Company] at $380K liquid comp."
