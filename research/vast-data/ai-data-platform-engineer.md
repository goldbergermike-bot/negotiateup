### AI Data Platform Engineer | Vast Data Global Negotiation Guide — SIGNATURE ROLE

**Negotiation DNA**

The AI Data Platform Engineer is Vast Data's **signature role** — the position that most directly embodies the company's mission to build the universal data platform for AI. You are not just using the platform or supporting it; you are architecting and building the core data infrastructure that eliminates the bottleneck between massive AI training datasets and GPU compute clusters. This role sits at the exact intersection of data engineering, distributed systems, storage architecture, and AI/ML infrastructure. At a $25B valuation, this is the role Vast Data cannot afford to lose candidates on. The **+25-35% AI Data Premium** reflects the extraordinary scarcity of engineers who combine deep data platform expertise with AI infrastructure knowledge.

This role commands premium compensation because: (1) it requires a rare blend of storage systems, distributed computing, and AI/ML expertise; (2) it is the most directly aligned role with Vast Data's core product and revenue; (3) the talent pool is exceptionally small — engineers with this profile are being recruited by every major AI company simultaneously; and (4) the work you do will define the architecture of the platform through IPO and beyond.

**Level Mapping:**
- Vast Data AI Data Platform Engineer = Google L5–L6 Infrastructure / Meta E5–E6 Infrastructure / Amazon Principal Data Engineer / Microsoft 64–66 Data Platform / Databricks Senior–Staff Platform Engineer / Snowflake (pre-IPO) Senior–Staff / NVIDIA Senior Data Infrastructure Engineer

**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, allowing employees to sell shares for real cash before any IPO. As the **signature role** at Vast Data, the AI Data Platform Engineer is positioned to receive the largest equity grants outside of executive leadership. The secondary market transforms this equity from speculative paper into a real, liquid asset — and you should negotiate accordingly.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. As an AI Data Platform Engineer — Vast Data's signature role — I'm building the exact product that justifies the $25B valuation. My equity grant should be at the top of the engineering band, and I want to negotiate on share count because I know these shares can be sold on the secondary market. This isn't speculative startup equity; it's ownership in a $25B company with proven liquidity."*

For the signature role specifically, you should negotiate for:
1. **Top-of-band share count** — not top-of-band dollar value, which can be manipulated. Demand a specific share count.
2. **Secondary sale eligibility confirmation in writing** — ask for written confirmation that you'll be eligible to participate in future secondary sales within your first year.
3. **Accelerated vesting consideration** — given the IPO trajectory, push for a 3-year vesting schedule or a front-loaded 4-year schedule (e.g., 40/30/20/10 instead of 25/25/25/25).
4. **Anti-dilution awareness** — ask about the company's dilution trajectory. At $25B with $1B raised, understand how future rounds or IPO mechanics affect your share value.

**Global Levers**

1. **Signature Role Premium:** "This is Vast Data's signature role — the position most central to the company's product and valuation. I expect the comp to reflect that: a +25-35% AI Data Premium on both base and equity, with a share grant at the very top of the engineering band. I'm targeting [X shares] at the $25B valuation, which reflects my direct impact on the core platform."
2. **Competing Offers from AI Infrastructure Leaders:** "I have competing offers from [Databricks/Snowflake/NVIDIA/Google] in the $360K–$390K total comp range. Vast Data's equity upside is the differentiator, but I need the share count to make the expected value calculation work. At [X shares] and the $25B secondary valuation, I can model the upside credibly — and I need the base at $250K+ to match the guaranteed portion of competing offers."
3. **Architecture Ownership and Title:** "As an AI Data Platform Engineer in the signature role, I want clarity on architecture ownership. I expect to own the technical vision for [specific subsystem] and have the autonomy to make architectural decisions that shape the platform. I'd also like to discuss a path to Staff or Principal title within 18–24 months, with a guaranteed equity refresh at promotion."
4. **IPO Equity Acceleration Clause:** "Given Vast Data's trajectory toward IPO, I'd like to discuss an equity acceleration clause — for example, 25% acceleration on a change of control (IPO or acquisition). This protects my equity value and is standard practice for senior technical hires at pre-IPO companies of this valuation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "As an AI Data Platform Engineer — Vast Data's signature role — with the +25-35% AI Data Premium, I'm targeting $370K–$392K total comp. I'd like the base at $255K, a share grant of [X shares] at the $25B valuation (top of the engineering band), a 15% bonus target, and a $50K signing bonus to offset unvested equity and competing offers in the $360K–$390K range from [Databricks/NVIDIA/Google]. The secondary market at $25B means I'm valuing this equity at near-face value — this is not a startup gamble. I also want written confirmation of secondary sale eligibility and an accelerated 3-year vesting schedule. My accept-at floor is $330K total comp with [Y shares] minimum and a 4-year standard vest. Below that, I'd accept the competing offer at [Company] for $370K liquid comp, because the guaranteed economics are too strong to ignore. But I believe Vast Data's equity upside, combined with the proven secondary liquidity, makes this the generational wealth-creation opportunity — if the share count is right."
