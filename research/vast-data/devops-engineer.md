### DevOps Engineer | Vast Data Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Secondary Liquidity + Base | AI Data Platform | $1B Secondary at $25B Valuation | Infrastructure Ops Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $140K–$175K | $22K–$48K | 5–10% | $178K–$248K |
| Tel Aviv | ₪460K–₪575K | $18K–$42K | 5–10% | $165K–$230K |
| Remote US | $130K–$165K | $22K–$48K | 5–10% | $168K–$235K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Vast Data build and maintain the infrastructure that delivers the universal data platform for AI at massive scale. You are responsible for CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, monitoring, and reliability for a platform that serves the most demanding AI workloads globally. At a $25B valuation, Vast Data's infrastructure must be bulletproof — every minute of downtime costs customers millions in delayed AI training. Your negotiation leverage comes from the critical nature of operational reliability and the scarcity of DevOps engineers who understand high-performance storage systems.

**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, allowing employees to sell shares for real cash before any IPO. For DevOps Engineers, who often receive moderate equity grants compared to product engineers, the liquidity story is essential: your shares aren't paper promises — they have a proven market value.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. As someone keeping the platform running, my work directly protects the $25B valuation. I want my equity to reflect that operational criticality."*

DevOps engineers should also negotiate for on-call compensation or additional PTO if the role involves pager duty. Operational roles carry burnout risk, and smart negotiation addresses both financial and quality-of-life factors.

**Global Levers**

1. **On-Call Compensation:** "If the role involves on-call rotations, I'd like a formal on-call compensation structure — either additional pay per on-call shift or compensatory time off. This is standard practice at infrastructure companies of this scale."
2. **Competing Infrastructure Offer:** "I have a DevOps offer from [Company] at $230K total comp. Vast Data's equity upside is attractive, but I need the share count to make the total comp competitive at the $25B valuation baseline."
3. **Certification and Training Budget:** "I'd like a $5K annual budget for cloud certifications (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes) and DevOps conferences. This is a small cost that directly improves my effectiveness and is standard at $25B companies."
4. **Remote Work with NYC Equity:** "If I'm working remotely, I expect the equity grant to remain at New York-level benchmarks. My uptime contributions are location-independent, and the shares trade at the same price regardless of where I sit."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a DevOps Engineer role at a $25B AI infrastructure company with proven secondary liquidity, I'm targeting $230K–$248K total comp. I'd like the base at $170K, a share grant of [X shares] at the $25B valuation, an 8% bonus target, a $15K signing bonus, and formal on-call compensation. The secondary market at $25B means I value the equity at face value. My accept-at floor is $205K total comp with [Y shares] minimum. Below that, the competing offer with liquid comp is the better choice."
