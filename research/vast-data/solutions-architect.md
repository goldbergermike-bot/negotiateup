**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Vast Data are the technical bridge between the universal data platform for AI and the enterprise customers who deploy it. You design architectures that eliminate data bottlenecks for AI training at Fortune 500 companies, hyperscalers, and AI research labs. At a $25B valuation, every customer deployment you design and support directly contributes to ARR growth and the IPO narrative. Your negotiation leverage comes from the rare combination of deep storage/data infrastructure expertise and customer-facing communication skills.

**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, allowing employees to sell shares for real cash before any IPO. Solutions Architects often face a comp structure that blends base, equity, and variable compensation tied to customer outcomes. The secondary liquidity means the equity portion of your comp has proven, convertible value.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. As a Solutions Architect, I directly drive customer adoption and ARR — the metrics that underpin the $25B valuation. My equity should reflect that revenue-generating impact."*

Solutions Architects should also negotiate for commission or variable compensation tied to deals they support. If your architectural work directly enables a customer win, you should capture some of that value beyond your base and equity.

**Global Levers**

1. **Variable Comp Tied to Customer Wins:** "I'd like a variable compensation component of 10–15% tied to customer deployment success metrics or ARR influenced. As a Solutions Architect, I directly drive revenue — my comp should reflect that."
2. **Competing SA Offer:** "I have a Solutions Architect offer from [Cloud Provider/Company] at $250K total comp. Vast Data's equity upside and the AI data platform mission are compelling, but the share count needs to bring total comp to $255K–$268K at the $25B valuation."
3. **Travel and Customer-Facing Expenses:** "If the role requires significant travel (25%+ of time), I'd like a $10K annual travel and expense stipend beyond standard reimbursement, plus flexibility for remote work when not on-site with customers."
4. **Technical Enablement Budget:** "I'd like a $5K annual budget for certifications, labs, and customer demo environments. Being able to build POCs quickly is essential for customer success."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "As a Solutions Architect with deep experience in data infrastructure and AI workloads, I'm targeting $255K–$268K total comp at Vast Data. I'd like the base at $180K, a share grant of [X shares] at the $25B valuation, a 12% bonus/variable target, and a $20K signing bonus. The secondary market at $25B gives me confidence that the equity is near-liquid. My accept-at floor is $225K total comp with [Y shares] minimum. Below that, the competing SA offer at [Company] with liquid comp wins on pure economics."
