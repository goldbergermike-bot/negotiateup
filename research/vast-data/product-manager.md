**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Vast Data shape the roadmap of the universal data platform for AI — deciding which features, integrations, and capabilities will drive adoption among the largest AI companies in the world. At a $25B valuation, Vast Data is past the early product-market-fit stage and is now scaling its platform for enterprise dominance. Your negotiation leverage comes from the fact that every PM decision directly influences revenue growth, customer retention, and the trajectory toward IPO. PMs with deep technical backgrounds in storage, data infrastructure, or AI/ML are especially valuable.

**$1B Secondary at $25B — The Liquid Wealth Premium**

Vast Data's February 2026 raise of $1B at a $25B valuation included a significant secondary component, allowing employees to sell shares for real cash. For Product Managers, this is especially relevant because PM comp at pre-IPO companies often skews heavily toward equity. If that equity is illiquid, you're taking a real pay cut compared to public company offers. With Vast Data's proven secondary market, the equity is closer to cash.

Use this script in negotiations: *"My equity isn't paper money — the $1B secondary at $25B proves there's a liquid market for Vast Data shares. I should negotiate for share count, not just paper value, because these shares can be converted to cash through secondary sales. As a PM, I'm driving product decisions that directly affect the valuation. I want my equity to reflect that impact, and the secondary market gives me confidence to weight equity more heavily in my total comp."*

PMs should also push for clarity on how product milestones (e.g., launching a new product line, hitting revenue targets) could trigger equity refreshes or bonuses. Tying your comp to product outcomes you control is a powerful negotiation move.

**Global Levers**

1. **Product Impact Equity Refresh:** "I'd like to discuss milestone-based equity refreshes tied to product outcomes — for example, an additional grant upon launching [specific feature/product] or hitting $X ARR. This aligns my incentives with the company's growth."
2. **Competing Offer with Liquid Comp:** "I have a PM offer from [Public Company] at $270K total comp with liquid RSUs. To make Vast Data competitive, I need a share count that, at the $25B secondary valuation, brings total comp to $280K–$295K."
3. **Domain Expertise Premium:** "My background in [data infrastructure / AI / storage] is directly relevant to Vast Data's platform. This domain expertise should command a premium — I'd like an additional $10K–$15K on base and a 15% larger equity grant."
4. **Signing Bonus for Transition:** "I'm leaving behind a quarterly bonus cycle at my current company. A signing bonus of $20K–$30K would offset the income gap during the transition."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "As a Product Manager with deep domain expertise in AI data infrastructure, I'm targeting $275K–$295K total comp at Vast Data. I'd like the base at $195K, a share grant of [X shares] at the $25B valuation, a 15% bonus target, and a $25K signing bonus. The secondary liquidity at $25B means I'm not discounting the equity — I'm valuing it at face value. My accept-at floor is $240K total comp with [Y shares] minimum. Below that, the liquid comp at [Public Company] is the more rational choice."
