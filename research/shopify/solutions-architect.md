**Negotiation DNA**

Shopify Solutions Architects design the technical architecture for enterprise merchants migrating to and scaling on the Shopify platform — from headless commerce implementations to multi-region deployments to Sidekick AI integration strategies. As a $100B+ market cap company expanding aggressively into enterprise commerce (Shopify Plus), Solutions Architects drive the highest-value merchant relationships. In February 2026, enterprise merchants need AI-native architecture guidance — how to integrate Sidekick into their existing tech stacks, leverage AI for merchandising automation, and build custom AI workflows on the Shopify platform.

Solutions Architect compensation reflects the direct revenue impact of enterprise merchant acquisition and retention. Each enterprise deal can represent millions in annual GMV, making the SA function a high-leverage investment.

**Level Mapping:** Shopify SA (L6-L8) = Google Cloud SA = AWS SA = Salesforce SA = Stripe SA
