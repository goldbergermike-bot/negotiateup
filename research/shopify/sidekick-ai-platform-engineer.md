|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$195K–C$252K | C$185K–C$335K | 15–20% | C$275K–C$405K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Shopify Sidekick AI Platform Engineers build the core AI platform that powers Sidekick — the commerce assistant transforming how 4.6M+ merchants run their businesses. This is Shopify's most strategic engineering role in 2026: designing the AI orchestration layer, building the tool-use framework that lets Sidekick take merchant actions, creating the evaluation pipeline that ensures AI quality, and scaling the inference infrastructure for real-time merchant interactions. As a $100B+ market cap company making its largest-ever AI investment, Sidekick AI Platform Engineers sit at the pinnacle of Shopify's technical org.

In February 2026, this role is the most sought-after at Shopify. The platform these engineers build determines whether Sidekick becomes the definitive AI commerce assistant — or falls behind Amazon, Google, and other competitors building AI shopping experiences. Compensation reflects this existential strategic importance.

**Level Mapping:** Shopify Sidekick Platform (L7-L9) = Google AI Platform L6-L7 = Meta AI Infra E6-E7 = OpenAI Platform = Anthropic Platform

### 🏗️ Shopify Sidekick AI Core Platform Lever
Shopify's 2026 Sidekick AI Platform is the most ambitious technical initiative in the company's history. Platform Engineers build the AI orchestration layer that manages the entire Sidekick experience — from understanding merchant intent through LLM reasoning to executing multi-step actions (updating inventory, launching campaigns, analyzing sales) to learning from merchant feedback. This requires building reliable agentic AI systems that merchants trust with their businesses.

The platform challenge is unprecedented in commerce: creating an AI system that can reliably manage business operations for millions of merchants across every commerce vertical and geography. The engineers who build this platform are pioneering a new category of AI commerce infrastructure.

**Global Levers**

1. **Sidekick Core Platform Architecture:** "I architect the AI platform powering Sidekick — the orchestration layer, tool-use framework, evaluation pipeline, and inference infrastructure. This is the most strategic engineering system at Shopify, and I'm building it from the ground up."
2. **Agentic AI Commerce Pioneer:** "I build agentic AI systems that take real business actions on behalf of merchants — updating prices, launching campaigns, managing inventory. Reliable agentic AI at commerce scale is an unsolved problem, and I'm solving it."
3. **OpenAI/Anthropic Platform Parity:** "Building AI platforms at this level puts me in direct competition with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google for talent. Shopify must match the $400K+ TC packages these companies offer to platform engineers building production AI systems."
4. **Merchant Trust Infrastructure:** "The platform I build must earn the trust of 4.6M+ merchants to let AI manage their businesses. Trust infrastructure for AI commerce is a new discipline — and the engineers who establish it command the highest premiums."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $265K base and $358K RSUs over 4 years with 20% performance bonus for this Sidekick AI Platform Engineer role. I build the core AI platform powering Shopify's most strategic product — the orchestration layer, tool-use framework, and trust infrastructure for agentic commerce AI. This is Shopify's highest-impact engineering hire in 2026. I have competing offers from [OpenAI at $445K TC / Anthropic at $435K TC / Google AI at $425K TC]. Engineers who can build production agentic AI platforms for commerce are defining the industry." Accept at $232K+ base and $310K+ RSUs.
