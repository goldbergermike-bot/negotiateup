**Negotiation DNA**

Shopify Data Scientists drive the analytics and ML models that power commerce intelligence for 4.6M+ merchants globally — from conversion rate optimization to demand forecasting to merchant health scoring. As a $100B+ market cap company, your models directly influence billions of dollars in gross merchandise volume. In February 2026, Shopify's Sidekick AI commerce assistant relies on data science models to generate merchant-specific insights, predict sales trends, and recommend optimal pricing and marketing strategies across 175+ countries.

The data science function at Shopify sits at the intersection of commerce domain expertise and advanced ML — a rare combination that commands premium compensation. Shopify's publicly traded RSUs provide strong liquidity, and the company's remote-first model ensures competitive packages regardless of location.

### 🏗️ Shopify Sidekick AI Commerce Intelligence Lever
Shopify's 2026 strategy positions Sidekick as the most intelligent AI commerce assistant in the industry. Data Scientists build the models that power Sidekick's recommendations — analyzing merchant data to predict optimal inventory levels, identify high-converting product categories, and suggest marketing timing. Every model you ship makes Sidekick smarter for millions of merchants.

The commerce intelligence challenge is uniquely complex: models must generalize across merchant types (DTC brands, enterprise retailers, international sellers) while personalizing recommendations to individual business contexts. This requires deep expertise in causal inference, multi-armed bandits, and time-series forecasting at massive scale.

**Global Levers**

1. **Sidekick AI Model Intelligence:** "I build the ML models powering Sidekick's merchant recommendations — from demand forecasting to conversion optimization to marketing ROI prediction. My models directly drive GMV growth across 4.6M+ merchants."
2. **Commerce Domain + ML Expertise:** "The intersection of commerce domain knowledge and advanced ML is rare. I bring both — understanding merchant economics while building sophisticated models. This dual expertise is why Shopify, Stripe, and Amazon all compete for commerce data scientists."
3. **Measurable Revenue Impact:** "My models have direct, measurable revenue impact on billions in GMV. Every improvement in conversion prediction or demand forecasting translates to merchant revenue growth — my work has clear ROI that justifies premium comp."
4. **AI Commerce Competition:** "Amazon, Stripe, and Square are all building AI commerce intelligence. Shopify must retain data scientists who understand the merchant ecosystem deeply enough to build Sidekick's intelligence layer."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $228K base and $288K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Data Scientist role. I build the ML models powering Sidekick AI's merchant intelligence — driving GMV growth through demand forecasting, conversion optimization, and personalized commerce recommendations at scale. I have competing offers from [Amazon at $355K TC / Stripe at $342K TC / Meta at $365K TC]. Commerce data scientists who can build AI-native merchant intelligence are exceptionally scarce." Accept at $200K+ base and $248K+ RSUs.
