**Negotiation DNA**

Shopify Security Engineers protect the commerce platform handling billions of dollars in transactions for 4.6M+ merchants across 175+ countries — from payment security and PCI compliance to merchant data protection to AI model security. As a $100B+ market cap company processing financial data at massive scale, security is existential. In February 2026, Sidekick AI introduces entirely new attack surfaces — prompt injection, model poisoning, AI-generated phishing, and adversarial merchant manipulation. Security engineers who can protect both traditional commerce and AI-native systems are in extreme demand.

The security function at Shopify carries outsized responsibility: a breach could compromise millions of merchants and their customers simultaneously, expose payment data, and destroy merchant trust in the platform. This critical risk profile commands premium compensation.

### 🏗️ Shopify Sidekick AI Security Lever
Shopify's 2026 Sidekick AI rollout creates unprecedented security challenges. The AI commerce assistant has access to merchant financial data, customer PII, business strategies, and payment systems — making it a high-value target for adversarial attacks. Security Engineers must build defenses against prompt injection attacks that could manipulate merchant operations, model poisoning that could corrupt business recommendations, and data exfiltration through AI-generated responses.

This is a new frontier in commerce security: protecting AI systems that actively manage merchant businesses. The security engineer who builds Sidekick's defensive architecture is pioneering a discipline that will define commerce AI security standards industry-wide.
