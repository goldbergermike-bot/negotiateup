**Negotiation DNA**

Shopify Security Engineers protect the commerce platform handling billions of dollars in transactions for 4.6M+ merchants across 175+ countries — from payment security and PCI compliance to merchant data protection to AI model security. As a $100B+ market cap company processing financial data at massive scale, security is existential. In February 2026, Sidekick AI introduces entirely new attack surfaces — prompt injection, model poisoning, AI-generated phishing, and adversarial merchant manipulation. Security engineers who can protect both traditional commerce and AI-native systems are in extreme demand.

The security function at Shopify carries outsized responsibility: a breach could compromise millions of merchants and their customers simultaneously, expose payment data, and destroy merchant trust in the platform. This critical risk profile commands premium compensation.

### 🏗️ Shopify Sidekick AI Security Lever
Shopify's 2026 Sidekick AI rollout creates unprecedented security challenges. The AI commerce assistant has access to merchant financial data, customer PII, business strategies, and payment systems — making it a high-value target for adversarial attacks. Security Engineers must build defenses against prompt injection attacks that could manipulate merchant operations, model poisoning that could corrupt business recommendations, and data exfiltration through AI-generated responses.

This is a new frontier in commerce security: protecting AI systems that actively manage merchant businesses. The security engineer who builds Sidekick's defensive architecture is pioneering a discipline that will define commerce AI security standards industry-wide.

**Global Levers**

1. **Sidekick AI Security Architecture:** "I build security defenses for Sidekick AI — protecting against prompt injection, model poisoning, and adversarial attacks on the AI commerce assistant. AI security for commerce is a new discipline, and I'm defining the standards."
2. **PCI + AI Compliance Intersection:** "I navigate the intersection of PCI-DSS payment security and emerging AI security regulations. This dual compliance expertise — protecting both financial transactions and AI systems — is rare and commands premium pay."
3. **Existential Risk Mitigation:** "A security breach at Shopify could compromise 4.6M+ merchants and billions in transactions. I protect against existential risk to a $100B+ company — this responsibility level justifies top-tier compensation."
4. **CrowdStrike/Palo Alto/Stripe Competition:** "CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Stripe aggressively recruit security engineers who understand commerce and AI. Shopify must offer competitive comp to retain engineers protecting the most valuable commerce platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $230K base and $292K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Security Engineer role. I protect Sidekick AI and the commerce platform handling billions in transactions for 4.6M+ merchants — defending against both traditional commerce threats and novel AI attack vectors. I have competing offers from [CrowdStrike at $355K TC / Palo Alto at $345K TC / Stripe at $332K TC]. Security engineers who can protect AI-native commerce platforms are among the scarcest talent in tech." Accept at $202K+ base and $255K+ RSUs.
