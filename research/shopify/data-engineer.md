### 🏗️ Shopify Sidekick AI Commerce Data Lever
Shopify's 2026 Sidekick AI strategy depends on data engineers building real-time commerce data pipelines that feed the AI assistant.

Every data pipeline you build directly improves Sidekick's ability to help merchants grow their businesses.

The data infrastructure must handle billions of daily events across 175+ countries with sub-second latency for AI inference while maintaining strict data governance and privacy compliance across jurisdictions. This is a foundational engineering challenge that commands premium compensation.
