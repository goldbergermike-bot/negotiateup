**Negotiation DNA**

Shopify Senior Software Engineers own critical systems across the commerce platform powering 4.6M+ merchants — leading technical design, mentoring engineers, and driving architectural decisions for storefront rendering, checkout optimization, payments, and the API platform. At the L7 level within Shopify's $100B+ ecosystem, you make decisions that directly impact merchant experience, platform reliability, and revenue at massive scale. With Shopify's 2026 Sidekick AI initiative, Senior SWEs lead the integration of AI capabilities into core commerce workflows — designing systems that enable Sidekick to interact with every part of the merchant experience reliably and at scale. Shopify RSUs with dual TSX/NYSE liquidity deliver premium equity for senior engineers who own the most critical commerce infrastructure. [Source: Shopify Sr SWE Comp 2025-2026]
