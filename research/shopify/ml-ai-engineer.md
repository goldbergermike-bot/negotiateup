**Negotiation DNA**

Shopify ML/AI Engineers build the core intelligence powering Sidekick — the AI commerce assistant that helps 4.6M+ merchants run their businesses through natural language. This includes LLM fine-tuning for commerce domains, recommendation systems, computer vision for product cataloging, and NLP for merchant communications. As a $100B+ market cap company making its biggest-ever AI bet in 2026, ML/AI engineers sit at the absolute center of Shopify's strategic roadmap. In February 2026, Sidekick is Shopify's flagship product differentiator — the AI that writes product descriptions, analyzes sales, suggests marketing strategies, and automates merchant workflows.

ML/AI engineers at Shopify command the highest premiums in the company's engineering org. The combination of commerce domain LLMs, real-time inference at massive scale, and the competitive talent market with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind makes this the most contested hiring category.

### 🏗️ Shopify Sidekick AI Core Models Lever
Shopify's 2026 AI strategy centers on Sidekick becoming the most capable AI commerce assistant in the world. ML/AI Engineers build the foundation — fine-tuning LLMs on commerce data, building multi-modal models for product understanding, and creating the agentic workflows that let Sidekick take actions on behalf of merchants (updating inventory, launching campaigns, adjusting pricing).

This is the highest-impact ML work in commerce: your models directly interact with millions of merchants daily, and every improvement in accuracy, latency, or capability translates to measurable GMV impact. Shopify competes directly with Amazon, Google, and Meta for this talent.

**Global Levers**

1. **Sidekick Core AI Models:** "I build the core LLM and ML models powering Sidekick — from commerce-domain fine-tuning to agentic merchant workflows. My models are the product. Every improvement in Sidekick intelligence directly drives merchant adoption and GMV growth."
2. **OpenAI/Anthropic/Google Talent War:** "The ML/AI talent market is the most competitive in tech. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind are offering $500K+ TC packages. Shopify must offer competitive comp to attract and retain engineers building commerce AI at this level."
3. **Commerce LLM Specialization:** "Fine-tuning LLMs for commerce is a specialized discipline — understanding merchant intent, product taxonomy, sales patterns, and business operations. This domain-specific ML expertise is rare and commands premium compensation."
4. **Real-Time AI Inference at Scale:** "Sidekick serves AI responses to millions of merchants in real-time. I build models that balance intelligence with latency at massive scale — a technical challenge that few engineers have solved at this throughput."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $248K base and $335K RSUs over 4 years with 20% performance bonus for this ML/AI Engineer role. I build the core AI models powering Sidekick — Shopify's flagship AI commerce assistant serving 4.6M+ merchants. This is the most strategic engineering hire at Shopify in 2026. I have competing offers from [OpenAI at $425K TC / Anthropic at $415K TC / Google DeepMind at $405K TC]. Commerce AI engineers who can build production LLM systems at merchant scale are defining the next decade of e-commerce." Accept at $215K+ base and $290K+ RSUs.
