**Global Employment Architecture — The Compliance Premium**

As a Senior Software Engineer at Deel, you lead technical design for systems managing employment compliance across 150+ countries. "As a Senior Software Engineer, I lead technical design for Deel's global payroll and compliance systems — architectural decisions affecting legal compliance across 150+ jurisdictions. I want IC3-IC4 equity reflecting my technical leadership and Deel's $12B valuation."

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Jurisdictional Architecture:** "I lead technical design for systems handling payroll, tax, and compliance across 150+ countries. This multi-jurisdictional complexity requires deep domain knowledge combined with senior engineering skills."
2. **$12B Valuation — Senior Equity:** "Senior engineers at a $12B company receive equity grants with substantial pre-IPO upside."
3. **EOR Infrastructure Leadership:** "I architect Deel's Employer of Record infrastructure — the legal entity structure enabling companies to hire employees in countries where they don't have entities."
4. **Remote.com/Rippling Competition:** "Remote.com, Rippling, and Papaya Global offer $400K+ TC for senior engineers with global employment platform expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $235K base and $290K equity over 4 years with 15% bonus for this Senior Software Engineer role. I lead technical design for Deel's global payroll and compliance systems across 150+ countries. I have competing offers from [Rippling at $405K TC / Remote.com at $388K TC / Papaya Global at $372K TC]. Senior engineers with global employment platform expertise are scarce." Accept at $202K+ base and $232K+ equity.
