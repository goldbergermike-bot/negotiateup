"As a Security Engineer, I protect Deel's global employment platform — sensitive payroll, tax, and employment data across 150+ countries under GDPR, LGPD, and dozens of local privacy laws."

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Jurisdictional Data Protection:** "I protect sensitive employment data under GDPR, LGPD, and dozens of local privacy regulations. This multi-jurisdictional security compliance is far more complex than standard application security."
2. **$12B Valuation — Trust-Critical Security:** "Deel's $12B valuation depends on customer trust with sensitive employment and financial data. A security breach would have severe regulatory and reputational consequences."
3. **Financial Data Security:** "I protect payroll processing and international payment systems handling financial transactions across 150+ countries."
4. **HR Tech Security Competition:** "Security engineers with global employment data protection expertise are scarce."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $222K base and $238K equity over 4 years with 15% bonus for this Security Engineer role. I protect Deel's global employment platform — sensitive payroll and employment data across 150+ countries under diverse privacy regulations. I have competing offers from [Rippling at $355K TC / Remote.com at $338K TC / Google at $368K TC]. Security engineers with multi-jurisdictional employment data protection expertise are rare." Accept at $188K+ base and $185K+ equity.
