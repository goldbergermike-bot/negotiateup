### Senior Software Engineer | Verizon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $175B Telecom Leader | Senior Technical Ownership | 5G Services + Enterprise Architecture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / New Jersey | $145K–$200K | $42K–$138K | 12-15% | $180K–$280K |
| Bay Area / Seattle | $150K–$208K | $48K–$148K | 12-15% | $190K–$298K |
| Dallas / Atlanta | $138K–$190K | $36K–$125K | 12-15% | $168K–$260K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Verizon own the architecture and implementation of systems serving 100M+ wireless connections and millions of Fios broadband customers. At the Senior level, you drive technical decisions for consumer platforms, network management systems, enterprise solutions, or 5G-enabled services. Verizon's Senior SWEs are expected to lead technical initiatives, mentor engineers, and deliver complex systems that directly impact customer experience and network performance.

Verizon's Senior SWE compensation has increased as the company modernizes its engineering culture and competes for senior talent. Total comp of $180K-$298K is competitive within the telecom-tech tier, with RSU grants and signing bonuses providing additional upside.

**Level Mapping:** Verizon Senior SWE (L5) = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Amazon SDE III = T-Mobile L6 = AT&T Senior

**Verizon Senior Engineering Premium**

Senior SWEs at Verizon have meaningful ownership because the company's technology modernization depends on senior technical leadership. Senior engineers who can drive cloud migration, API-first architecture, and modern engineering practices are the agents of change in Verizon's transformation from legacy telecom to modern technology company.

**Global Levers**

1. **Senior Technical Ownership:** "At the Senior level, I'll own architecture decisions affecting 100M+ wireless connections and millions of Fios customers. This ownership and technical leadership responsibility warrants a base of $[X]K."

2. **Technology Modernization Leadership:** "Verizon's technology modernization requires senior engineers who can drive change — cloud migration, API-first architecture, and modern engineering practices. My track record of leading similar transformations at [company] is directly valuable. RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Competing Senior Offers:** "I have competing offers from [Google/Amazon/T-Mobile] at the L5/SDE III level with total comp of $[X]K. While Verizon's 5G platform opportunity and premium carrier position are compelling, the compensation gap needs to narrow."

4. **Enterprise + Consumer Dual Scope:** "I'll lead technical initiatives spanning both consumer (My Verizon, Fios) and enterprise (business networking, 5G solutions) platforms. This dual-scope senior role is equivalent to broader roles at other companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the Senior SWE role at Verizon — driving technical direction for America's premium carrier's platforms and 5G services. To align with market rates: a base of $[185-200]K, RSU grant of $[120-138]K, and a signing bonus of $[25-35]K. My competing offer is $[X]K. At $[248-280]K, this reflects senior engineering ownership and Verizon's technology modernization value. I'm ready to commit."
