**Negotiation DNA**

The 5G Edge Platform Engineer is Verizon's signature technical role — building the edge computing platform that leverages Verizon's 5G network to deliver ultra-low-latency computing services for enterprises, developers, and consumers. Verizon's $175B market cap and position as America's premium wireless carrier are increasingly tied to 5G monetization, and edge computing is the key platform that transforms 5G from a faster phone connection into a computing platform for autonomous vehicles, AR/VR, IoT, smart factories, and real-time AI inference.

This role commands a 12-18% 5G/edge premium because it requires rare dual expertise in both telecommunications network architecture and cloud-native distributed computing. Engineers who can design edge computing nodes that integrate with Verizon's 5G core network, build developer-facing APIs, and ensure sub-10ms latency for enterprise applications are in extremely high demand from carriers, cloud providers, and hyperscalers alike.

**Level Mapping:** Verizon 5G Edge Platform Engineer (Senior) = AWS Edge Engineer (Senior) = Google Cloud Edge Engineer L5 = Microsoft Azure Edge Engineer 63 = T-Mobile Senior 5G Engineer

**Verizon 5G Edge Premium — The Next Computing Platform**

Verizon's 5G edge computing strategy represents the company's most ambitious bet on the future of telecom: transforming from a connectivity provider into a computing platform provider. Verizon's Mobile Edge Compute (MEC) platform, partnerships with AWS (Wavelength), Microsoft (Azure Edge Zones), and Google Cloud, and its own edge infrastructure investments position the company at the frontier of distributed computing. 5G Edge Platform Engineers are building the infrastructure for the next computing paradigm — where computation happens at the network edge, enabling use cases that cloud-only or on-premise-only architectures cannot support.

**Global Levers**

1. **Signature Role — Next Computing Platform:** "I'm building Verizon's edge computing platform — the infrastructure that transforms 5G from a connectivity service into a distributed computing platform. This is the most strategically important technology initiative at Verizon, and the quality of the platform I build determines whether Verizon can monetize its 5G investment beyond connectivity."

2. **5G + Edge Dual Expertise Scarcity:** "Engineers with both telecom 5G architecture and cloud-native edge computing expertise are among the rarest in the market. AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and every major carrier compete for this talent. I'd like RSUs of $[X]K reflecting this scarcity."

3. **Enterprise Revenue Platform:** "Verizon's edge platform enables enterprise use cases worth billions — autonomous vehicles, smart factories, AR/VR, and real-time AI. The platform I build is the revenue engine for Verizon's enterprise 5G strategy."

4. **Hyperscaler Partnership Integration:** "I'll architect the integration between Verizon's 5G network and hyperscaler edge platforms (AWS Wavelength, Azure Edge Zones). This requires deep understanding of both telecom and cloud architectures — a rare combination that commands premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Building Verizon's 5G edge computing platform is the most compelling opportunity at the intersection of telecom and cloud computing. I hold a competing offer from [AWS/Google Cloud/T-Mobile] at $[X]K. To make Verizon competitive: $[190K] base, $[130K] RSUs over four years, and a $[25K] signing bonus. At $[265-290]K, this reflects the 5G/edge dual expertise premium and the signature nature of this role. I believe in Verizon's edge strategy — let's align."
