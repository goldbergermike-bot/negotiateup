**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Verizon build technology for America's premium wireless carrier and one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. With a $175B market cap and NYC headquarters, Verizon operates across wireless (100M+ connections), Fios broadband and TV, enterprise networking solutions, and 5G-enabled services. SWEs work on consumer-facing platforms (My Verizon app, Fios TV, account management), network management systems, enterprise solutions, and 5G API platforms. Verizon has invested significantly in modernizing its technology stack, migrating from legacy telecom systems to cloud-native platforms and building a modern engineering culture.

Verizon's compensation philosophy combines traditional telecom stability (competitive base salaries, strong benefits) with increasing tech premiums (RSU grants, signing bonuses) to compete for software engineering talent against Big Tech and other carriers. Base salaries of $120K-$175K, RSUs up to $110K over four years, and 10-15% bonuses bring total comp to $150K-$240K.

**Level Mapping:** Verizon SWE (L3-L4) = Google L3-L4 = Meta E3-E4 = Amazon SDE I-II = T-Mobile L4-L5 = AT&T L3-L4

**Verizon Technology Premium**

Verizon has invested billions in its technology modernization, building engineering centers and recruiting talent from Big Tech. The company's 5G network investment, Fios fiber platform, and enterprise solutions require modern engineering capabilities — cloud-native architectures, microservices, APIs, and DevOps practices. SWEs who bring Big Tech engineering practices to Verizon accelerate this modernization and are compensated with tech premiums above traditional telecom levels.
