**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Verizon build the data infrastructure powering intelligence across America's premium wireless carrier. With 100M+ wireless connections, millions of Fios customers, and a massive enterprise networking business, Verizon generates enormous data volumes — network performance telemetry, customer usage and billing data, enterprise service analytics, and 5G quality metrics. Data Engineers design the pipelines, warehouses, and streaming architectures that transform this data into the intelligence driving network optimization, customer experience, churn prediction, and enterprise sales intelligence.

Verizon's data infrastructure modernization is ongoing — migrating from legacy data warehouses to cloud-native platforms, implementing real-time streaming, and building foundations for AI/ML-driven network management and customer analytics.

**Level Mapping:** Verizon Data Engineer (L3-L5) = Google L3-L5 DE = Meta E3-E5 DE = Amazon DE II-III = T-Mobile L4-L6

**Verizon Enterprise Data Premium**

Verizon's data is uniquely valuable because it combines wireless network data, Fios broadband data, and enterprise networking data — enabling cross-domain analytics that inform network investment, customer strategy, and enterprise sales. Data Engineers who build infrastructure connecting these domains enable Verizon to optimize its massive network investment and grow customer lifetime value.

**Global Levers**

1. **Network + Customer Data Integration:** "I'll build data infrastructure connecting Verizon's wireless network telemetry, customer behavior, and enterprise analytics. This cross-domain data expertise enables smarter network investment and customer intelligence. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Data Modernization Value:** "Verizon's data infrastructure modernization — cloud migration, real-time streaming, ML foundations — is critical to competing in the 5G era. My experience with [modern data platforms] accelerates this transformation. RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Competing Data Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Snowflake/Amazon/T-Mobile] at $[X]K. Verizon's enterprise data challenges are compelling, but the compensation needs to be competitive."

4. **Enterprise Analytics Infrastructure:** "I'll build data platforms that power Verizon's enterprise sales intelligence and service analytics — directly supporting the company's high-margin enterprise business."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Building Verizon's data platform — connecting wireless, broadband, and enterprise data at scale — is a compelling data engineering challenge. To align with market rates: a base of $[X+10-12]K, RSU grant of $[Y+20-28]K, and a signing bonus of $[15-22]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[205-242]K, this reflects competitive data engineering rates and Verizon's cross-domain data platform opportunity. I'm ready to accept."
