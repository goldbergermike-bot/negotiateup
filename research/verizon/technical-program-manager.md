### Technical Program Manager | Verizon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $175B Telecom Leader | Cross-Organization Program Delivery | Network + Platform + Enterprise Programs

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / New Jersey | $132K–$192K | $38K–$130K | 12-18% | $165K–$268K |
| Bay Area / Seattle | $138K–$200K | $42K–$138K | 12-18% | $175K–$285K |
| Dallas / Atlanta | $125K–$182K | $32K–$118K | 12-18% | $152K–$248K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Verizon orchestrate delivery of complex technology programs across a $175B telecommunications leader. When Verizon deploys 5G network upgrades, launches new consumer products, or rolls out enterprise solutions — a TPM coordinates the cross-functional execution. The role demands technical literacy across both telecommunications and software platforms, combined with exceptional program management skills to navigate Verizon's complex organizational structure spanning network engineering, consumer platforms, enterprise solutions, and operations.

Verizon's program complexity is unique because it spans physical infrastructure (cell towers, fiber, network equipment) and digital platforms (consumer apps, enterprise services, 5G APIs). TPMs who can coordinate across these domains deliver programs that bridge the physical-digital divide.

**Level Mapping:** Verizon TPM (L4-L6) = Google L4-L6 TPM = Meta E4-E6 TPM = Amazon TPM L5-L7 = T-Mobile TPM

**Verizon Program Complexity Premium**

Verizon TPMs operate in a complex environment that includes network infrastructure deployment, consumer platform delivery, enterprise solution rollouts, and technology modernization initiatives. The regulatory environment (FCC, government contracts) adds another layer of complexity. TPMs who can navigate this multi-dimensional program landscape while maintaining Verizon's reliability standards are exceptionally valuable.

**Global Levers**

1. **Physical + Digital Program Complexity:** "Verizon's programs span network infrastructure and software platform delivery — a dual complexity that exceeds pure tech companies. My experience with [infrastructure + software] programs is this dual expertise."

2. **Enterprise Program Delivery:** "Managing enterprise solution programs for Verizon's strategic accounts requires coordination across sales, engineering, and operations. My delivery track record at [company] translates directly."

3. **Competing TPM Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/T-Mobile] at $[X]K. Verizon's program complexity is compelling, but the compensation needs to be competitive."

4. **Regulatory + Technical Navigation:** "Verizon's regulatory environment (FCC, government) adds complexity to program management. My experience navigating regulated industries is directly valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Driving cross-organization programs at Verizon — spanning network, consumer, and enterprise delivery — is the complex TPM work I thrive on. To align with market rates: a base of $[178-192]K, RSU grant of $[112-130]K, and a signing bonus of $[20-30]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[235-268]K, this reflects telecom program complexity and the competitive TPM market. I'm ready to deliver."
