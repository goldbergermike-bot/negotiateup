**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Verizon lead teams building technology for America's premium wireless carrier and enterprise networking leader. Whether you're managing consumer platform teams, 5G services engineering, enterprise solutions, or network operations technology, your leadership directly impacts products serving 100M+ connections and enterprise customers who depend on Verizon's network reliability. Verizon EMs are expected to drive technology modernization — hiring engineers from modern tech backgrounds, adopting cloud-native practices, and delivering at a pace that keeps Verizon competitive against T-Mobile and emerging tech threats.

Verizon has invested in engineering management quality, recognizing that the technology transformation depends on managers who can bridge traditional telecom operational excellence with Big Tech engineering innovation.

**Level Mapping:** Verizon EM (M1-M2) = Google L5-L6 Manager = Meta E5-E6 Manager = Amazon L6-L7 Manager = T-Mobile EM

**Verizon Management Premium**

Verizon EMs have a unique leadership challenge: driving technology modernization within an organization that must simultaneously maintain carrier-grade reliability. Managers who can foster innovation (new architectures, modern practices, fast iteration) while maintaining operational excellence (99.99%+ uptime, regulatory compliance) bring a rare leadership combination that is valued at Verizon.

**Global Levers**

1. **Transformation Leadership:** "Verizon's technology modernization requires managers who can drive change — hiring from Big Tech, adopting modern practices, and accelerating delivery — while maintaining carrier-grade reliability. My leadership experience at [company] bridges both worlds."

2. **Talent Recruitment Investment:** "Competitive EM compensation enables me to recruit top engineers from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. My hiring track record directly impacts Verizon's engineering capabilities."

3. **Competing EM Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/T-Mobile] at $[X]K for a management role. Verizon's leadership challenge is compelling, but the package needs to be competitive."

4. **Enterprise + Consumer Scope:** "I'll manage teams serving both consumer and enterprise customers — a dual scope that exceeds most single-product management roles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Leading engineering at Verizon — driving modernization while maintaining carrier-grade reliability for 100M+ connections — is exactly the leadership challenge I want. To align with market rates: a base of $[208-222]K, RSU grant of $[155-175]K, 18% bonus, and a $[35-48]K signing bonus. My competing offer is $[X]K. At $[300-340]K, this reflects the EM market and Verizon's unique transformation leadership needs. I'm ready to lead."
