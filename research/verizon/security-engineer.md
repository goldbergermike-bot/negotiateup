**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Verizon protect critical national telecommunications infrastructure serving 100M+ wireless connections, millions of Fios customers, and thousands of enterprise clients including government agencies. Verizon's security scope is among the most demanding in the industry: wireless network security, 5G core infrastructure, consumer data protection, enterprise networking security, and government/defense-grade requirements. The company operates one of the largest enterprise cybersecurity businesses in the world (Verizon Business Security Services), and its annual Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) is the industry's most influential cybersecurity research.

Verizon's security organization is world-class, offering Security Engineers the opportunity to work with cutting-edge security tools, threat intelligence, and incident response capabilities that rival any technology company.

**Level Mapping:** Verizon Security Engineer (L3-L5) = Google L3-L5 Security = Meta E3-E5 Security = Amazon Security Engineer II-III = AT&T Security L3-L5

**Verizon Security Leadership Premium**

Verizon's position in cybersecurity is unique among telecom companies — the company is both a security practitioner (protecting its own infrastructure) and a security provider (enterprise cybersecurity services). Security Engineers at Verizon benefit from this dual perspective, gaining exposure to the threat landscape across industries through Verizon's security consulting and DBIR research. This breadth of security experience is highly valued in the market.

**Global Levers**

1. **Critical Infrastructure Security:** "I'll protect telecommunications infrastructure serving 100M+ Americans — critical national infrastructure that supports emergency services and public safety. This responsibility exceeds most tech security roles. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Security Industry Leadership:** "Verizon's DBIR is the most influential cybersecurity report in the industry. Working at Verizon means contributing to security thought leadership while protecting world-class infrastructure. RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Enterprise Security Business:** "Verizon's enterprise security business gives me exposure to threat landscapes across industries — unique experience that makes me more valuable. This dual practitioner-provider perspective warrants premium compensation."

4. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Cybersecurity talent with telecom infrastructure and enterprise security expertise is exceptionally rare. My competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto/AWS] is $[X]K."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Protecting Verizon's critical infrastructure and contributing to the industry's leading security organization is a mission I'm passionate about. To align with market rates: a base of $[175-190]K, RSU grant of $[108-125]K, and a signing bonus of $[20-30]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[228-262]K, this reflects security talent scarcity and critical infrastructure responsibility. I'm ready to join Verizon's security organization."
