### Product Manager | Verizon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $175B Telecom Leader | Consumer + Enterprise Product Strategy | 5G Services Portfolio

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / New Jersey | $132K–$192K | $38K–$132K | 12-18% | $165K–$272K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Verizon own the strategy and roadmap for products serving 100M+ wireless connections and millions of enterprise customers at a $175B company. Whether you're driving the My Verizon consumer app strategy, defining 5G-enabled enterprise products, building Fios broadband experiences, or developing new IoT and edge computing offerings, you sit at the intersection of technology, business, and customer experience at America's premium carrier.

Verizon PMs operate across both consumer and enterprise products — a dual scope that creates broader product ownership than many single-market companies. The company has invested in building a strong PM function, recruiting product leaders from Big Tech and consumer companies.

**Level Mapping:** Verizon PM (P3-P5) = Google L4-L6 PM = Meta E4-E6 PM = Amazon PM L5-L7 = T-Mobile PM

**Verizon Product Strategy Premium**

Verizon PMs have a unique advantage: the company's premium positioning and enterprise relationships create product opportunities that competitors cannot match. 5G enterprise products, edge computing services, and IoT solutions represent significant growth vectors. PMs who can identify and execute on these opportunities drive differentiated revenue growth for Verizon's highest-margin business segments.

**Global Levers**

1. **Consumer + Enterprise Dual Scope:** "I'll own product strategy spanning both consumer (100M+ connections) and enterprise (high-margin business services). This dual-scope PM role creates broader ownership than single-market companies. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **5G Product Revenue:** "My product decisions will shape Verizon's 5G services — FWA, enterprise 5G, IoT, edge computing. These are new revenue streams that depend on strong product execution. RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Competing PM Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/T-Mobile] at $[X]K. Verizon's premium positioning and enterprise product opportunity are compelling, but the package needs to be competitive."

4. **Enterprise Premium Pricing Strategy:** "Verizon's premium pricing depends on premium product experiences. My product strategy will directly support and justify Verizon's pricing power."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Owning product strategy at Verizon — spanning consumer, enterprise, and 5G services at America's premium carrier — is a compelling PM opportunity. To align with market rates: a base of $[178-192]K, RSU grant of $[115-132]K, and a signing bonus of $[22-32]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[240-272]K, this reflects the dual consumer-enterprise scope and 5G product opportunity. I'm ready to accept."
