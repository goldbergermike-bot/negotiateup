**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Verizon shape the experience for 100M+ wireless customers and millions of Fios subscribers across consumer and enterprise touchpoints. The My Verizon app, Fios TV interface, account management tools, and enterprise service portals are used daily by millions — and the quality of these experiences directly impacts customer satisfaction, self-service adoption, and competitive positioning against T-Mobile (which has aggressively invested in consumer UX) and AT&T.

Verizon has invested in elevating its design practice, recognizing that premium pricing demands premium experience. The company has recruited design talent from Big Tech consumer companies and established dedicated design teams for consumer, enterprise, and 5G-enabled services.

**Level Mapping:** Verizon Product Designer (D2-D4) = Google L3-L5 UX = Meta E3-E5 Designer = T-Mobile D3-D5 = Amazon UX II-III

**Verizon Premium Experience Premium**

Verizon's premium carrier positioning means customer experience must justify premium pricing. Designs that simplify account management, improve self-service adoption, and create compelling 5G service experiences directly support Verizon's pricing strategy. Designers who deliver premium consumer experience at carrier scale protect Verizon's market position and pricing power.
