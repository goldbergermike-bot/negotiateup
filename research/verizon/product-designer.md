### Product Designer | Verizon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $175B Telecom Leader | Premium Consumer Experience | My Verizon + Fios + Enterprise Design

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / New Jersey | $115K–$165K | $25K–$98K | 10-15% | $138K–$222K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Verizon shape the experience for 100M+ wireless customers and millions of Fios subscribers across consumer and enterprise touchpoints. The My Verizon app, Fios TV interface, account management tools, and enterprise service portals are used daily by millions — and the quality of these experiences directly impacts customer satisfaction, self-service adoption, and competitive positioning against T-Mobile (which has aggressively invested in consumer UX) and AT&T.

Verizon has invested in elevating its design practice, recognizing that premium pricing demands premium experience. The company has recruited design talent from Big Tech consumer companies and established dedicated design teams for consumer, enterprise, and 5G-enabled services.

**Level Mapping:** Verizon Product Designer (D2-D4) = Google L3-L5 UX = Meta E3-E5 Designer = T-Mobile D3-D5 = Amazon UX II-III

**Verizon Premium Experience Premium**

Verizon's premium carrier positioning means customer experience must justify premium pricing. Designs that simplify account management, improve self-service adoption, and create compelling 5G service experiences directly support Verizon's pricing strategy. Designers who deliver premium consumer experience at carrier scale protect Verizon's market position and pricing power.

**Global Levers**

1. **Premium Brand Experience:** "Verizon's premium pricing demands premium UX. My designs will directly impact whether customers perceive Verizon's experience as worth the premium. This brand-critical design responsibility warrants a base of $[X]K."

2. **100M+ Customer Scale:** "Designs used by 100M+ customers — UX improvements translate to millions in self-service savings and customer retention. RSUs of $[Y]K reflect this scale impact."

3. **Competing Design Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/T-Mobile/Amazon] at $[X]K. Verizon's premium experience challenge is compelling, but the compensation needs to be competitive."

4. **Competitive Design Differentiation:** "T-Mobile has invested heavily in consumer UX as a competitive differentiator. Verizon needs designers who can match or exceed this experience quality. My expertise directly addresses this competitive need."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Designing Verizon's premium consumer experience for 100M+ customers is a compelling design challenge. To align with market rates: a base of $[X+8-10]K, RSU grant of $[Y+15-22]K, and a signing bonus of $[10-18]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[190-222]K, this reflects premium experience responsibility and the competitive design market. I'm ready to join."
