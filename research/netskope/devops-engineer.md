### Netskope UZTNA & Modernized Network Consolidation Lever

Netskope's September 2025 IPO brought Wall Street's expectations for uptime and reliability to the forefront. At $754M ARR with 34% growth, the Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) platform must deliver 99.999% availability — enterprises are replacing their entire legacy security stack with Netskope as part of the Modernized Network Consolidation strategy, and they will not tolerate downtime. DevOps Engineers are the guardians of this availability. You manage the Kubernetes clusters, Terraform configurations, CI/CD pipelines, and observability stacks that ensure every release is smooth and every incident is resolved in minutes. The scale of Netskope's infrastructure — processing billions of inline security decisions daily across global points of presence — makes this one of the most challenging and impactful DevOps roles in cybersecurity.

#### Global Levers — Negotiation Language

**1. Platform Reliability Revenue Lever**
> "Netskope's $754M ARR depends on platform availability. As a DevOps Engineer, I'm directly responsible for the infrastructure reliability that keeps enterprise customers on the UZTNA platform. I'm targeting $195,000 base salary to reflect the revenue-critical nature of this role."

**2. Post-IPO Infrastructure Scale Lever**
> "Since the September 2025 IPO, Netskope faces increased scrutiny on operational excellence. With 34% growth, the infrastructure needs to scale accordingly, and I bring deep experience scaling cloud-native security platforms. I'm requesting $200,000 in RSUs over four years to align with the post-IPO equity bands for infrastructure roles."

**3. Modernized Network Consolidation Uptime Lever**
> "Customers adopt Netskope's Modernized Network Consolidation platform only if they trust its reliability above their existing tools. My job is to make that trust earned — through automated deployment, chaos engineering, and observability. I'd like a $28,000 signing bonus to offset my forfeited equity and start contributing to platform reliability immediately."

**4. Competitive DevOps Market Lever**
> "I have competing offers from HashiCorp and Datadog, both offering total packages above $280,000. Netskope's UZTNA infrastructure scale is more compelling, but I need the compensation package to match the market at $290,000+ Year 1 total comp."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $195,000 base + $200,000 RSU (4-year) + $28,000 signing bonus. DevOps engineers at cloud security companies carry outsized impact because downtime equals lost revenue and customer trust. If they counter at $175,000 base, push for 1,800 RSU shares and a $22,000 signing bonus. Reference competing offers from HashiCorp or Datadog at $280,000+ total comp. Your accept-at floor should be $170,000 base + $140,000 RSU (4-year) + $18,000 signing bonus, yielding ~$225,000 Year 1 total compensation.
