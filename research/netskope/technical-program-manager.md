### Technical Program Manager | Netskope Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Post-IPO Cloud Security | UZTNA Cross-Functional Execution | $754M ARR & 34% Growth | RSU Equity (Public Stock) | Modernized Network Consolidation

Netskope's September 2025 IPO created public-market accountability for program execution — quarterly earnings now depend on shipping features on time. As a Technical Program Manager (TPM), you orchestrate cross-functional execution across engineering, product, design, and go-to-market teams to deliver the Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) platform capabilities that sustain $754M ARR and 34% growth. Your programs span the full scope of Netskope's Modernized Network Consolidation roadmap, from feature development through customer rollout. Post-IPO RSU grants vest into publicly traded Netskope stock, and your ability to keep programs on track directly impacts the company's ability to hit the targets Wall Street expects.

**Level Mapping:** Technical Program Manager (IC3–IC4) | Netskope Program Management Band 3–4 | Equivalent: Google L4–L5 TPM, Meta IC4–IC5 TPM, Palo Alto Networks TPM3

### Netskope UZTNA & Modernized Network Consolidation Lever

Since Netskope's September 2025 IPO, execution velocity has become a public-market metric. At $754M ARR with 34% growth, the company must ship Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) features faster than Zscaler, Palo Alto Networks, and Fortinet to maintain leadership. TPMs are the execution engine that makes this possible — coordinating multi-team programs, managing dependencies, mitigating risks, and ensuring the Modernized Network Consolidation roadmap translates into shipped product. Every quarter, analysts and investors evaluate Netskope's ability to deliver on its platform promise, and your program management discipline is what turns roadmap items into released capabilities. TPMs with experience in security platform programs are rare, and Netskope's post-IPO cadence demands precision.

#### Global Levers — Negotiation Language

**1. Post-IPO Execution Criticality Lever**
> "Netskope's September 2025 IPO means program execution is now tied to quarterly earnings and market expectations. As a TPM, I'm the person who ensures the UZTNA roadmap ships on time. I'm targeting $205,000 base salary to reflect the execution-critical nature of this role in a post-IPO environment."

**2. UZTNA Program Scale Lever**
> "Managing programs on a platform generating $754M ARR with 34% growth requires sophisticated cross-functional coordination. I bring experience running multi-quarter platform programs at scale, and I'm requesting $220,000 in RSUs over four years to align my compensation with the scope and impact of these programs."

**3. Modernized Network Consolidation Delivery Lever**
> "Netskope's Modernized Network Consolidation strategy requires shipping complex, multi-team features on tight timelines. I have a proven track record of delivering similar platform consolidation programs, and I'd like a $32,000 signing bonus to offset the equity I'm forfeiting to join Netskope during this critical post-IPO growth phase."

**4. Competitive TPM Market Lever**
> "I'm evaluating offers from Google and Palo Alto Networks for senior TPM roles, both offering total packages above $300,000. Netskope's UZTNA program complexity is what excites me most, but I need the total package to be competitive at $310,000+ in Year 1."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $205,000 base + $220,000 RSU (4-year) + $32,000 signing bonus. TPMs at post-IPO companies carry disproportionate execution influence — anchor your negotiation on quarterly delivery commitments. If they counter at $185,000 base, push for 2,000 RSU shares and a $25,000 signing bonus. Reference competing offers from Google or Palo Alto Networks at $300,000+ total comp. Your accept-at floor should be $175,000 base + $150,000 RSU (4-year) + $20,000 signing bonus, yielding ~$235,000 Year 1 total compensation.
