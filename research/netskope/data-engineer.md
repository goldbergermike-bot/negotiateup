### Data Engineer | Netskope Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Post-IPO Cloud Security | UZTNA Data Platform | $754M ARR & 34% Growth | RSU Equity (Public Stock) | Modernized Network Consolidation

Netskope's September 2025 IPO exposed the scale of data flowing through its security platform — billions of events daily, petabytes of telemetry, and real-time analytics that drive security decisions. As a Data Engineer, you design and maintain the data pipelines, storage infrastructure, and ETL systems that power Netskope's Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) platform. With $754M ARR and 34% growth, your data infrastructure must scale ahead of customer demand while maintaining the low-latency performance that security enforcement requires. The Modernized Network Consolidation strategy depends on centralized data — and you build the systems that centralize it. Post-IPO RSU grants vest into publicly traded Netskope stock, tying your compensation to the platform performance your data systems enable.

### Netskope UZTNA & Modernized Network Consolidation Lever

Netskope's September 2025 IPO highlighted the company's data infrastructure as a core competitive advantage. At $754M ARR with 34% growth, the Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) platform processes security telemetry at massive scale — and Data Engineers build the pipelines that make this possible. The Modernized Network Consolidation strategy requires unified data: when customers consolidate five legacy appliances into Netskope's single platform, all the data from those disparate tools must flow through a single, coherent data architecture. Data Engineers build the streaming pipelines, data lakes, and real-time analytics infrastructure that turn raw telemetry into the security intelligence that differentiates Netskope. Engineers with experience building real-time security data platforms are extremely scarce, and Netskope's growth demands continuous scaling of its data layer.

#### Global Levers — Negotiation Language

**1. Data Scale Lever**
> "Netskope's UZTNA platform processes billions of security events daily, and that volume is growing with $754M ARR at 34% growth. I bring direct experience building data pipelines at this scale, and I'm targeting $195,000 base salary to reflect the specialized nature of real-time security data engineering."

**2. Post-IPO Analytics Impact Lever**
> "Since Netskope's September 2025 IPO, the company's analytics capabilities are a key differentiator for investors and customers. I'm requesting $200,000 in RSUs over four years — a grant reflecting the direct connection between data infrastructure quality and platform competitiveness in the post-IPO market."

**3. Modernized Network Consolidation Data Lever**
> "Netskope's Modernized Network Consolidation strategy depends on unified data from previously siloed security tools. I specialize in building the data integration and streaming architectures that make this consolidation technically feasible. I'd like a $28,000 signing bonus to compensate for my forfeited equity and begin building this infrastructure immediately."

**4. Competitive Data Engineering Lever**
> "I have active offers from Snowflake and Databricks, both offering total packages above $280,000. Netskope's real-time security data challenge is more compelling to me, but I need the total compensation to match at $290,000+ Year 1."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $195,000 base + $200,000 RSU (4-year) + $28,000 signing bonus. Data engineers at security companies carry a premium because the data platform is the product. If they counter at $175,000 base, push for 1,800 RSU shares and a $22,000 signing bonus. Reference competing offers from Snowflake or Databricks at $280,000+ total comp. Your accept-at floor should be $170,000 base + $140,000 RSU (4-year) + $18,000 signing bonus, yielding ~$225,000 Year 1 total compensation.
