### Netskope UZTNA & Modernized Network Consolidation Lever

Netskope's September 2025 IPO validated the Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) market thesis at scale. At $754M ARR with 34% growth, the company is winning enterprise deals by convincing CISOs to replace their fragmented legacy security stacks with Netskope's unified platform — and Solutions Architects are on the front line of that conversation. The Modernized Network Consolidation strategy is not just a marketing tagline; it is the technical transformation you design and validate for each customer. You create the architecture diagrams, migration plans, and proof-of-concept deployments that give customers the confidence to consolidate. Your technical credibility directly determines whether a $500K deal becomes a $2M deal, and Netskope's growth trajectory depends on scaling this capability across global accounts.

#### Global Levers — Negotiation Language

**1. Revenue Influence Lever**
> "Solutions Architects at Netskope directly influence deal size and expansion revenue. With $754M ARR and 34% growth, every customer architecture I design translates to measurable revenue impact. I'm targeting $205,000 base salary to reflect the commercial value of this technical role."

**2. Post-IPO Equity Alignment Lever**
> "Netskope's September 2025 IPO means my RSU grants vest into liquid shares tied to the very customer outcomes I influence. I'm requesting $220,000 in RSUs over four years — a grant level that aligns my incentives with Netskope's post-IPO growth trajectory."

**3. Modernized Network Consolidation Expertise Lever**
> "I have direct experience designing network consolidation architectures for enterprise customers — exactly the skill set Netskope needs to execute its Modernized Network Consolidation strategy. I bring relationships with CISOs and a track record of converting proof-of-concept deployments into multi-million dollar deals. I'm requesting a $32,000 signing bonus to compensate for unvested equity at my current employer."

**4. Competitive SE/SA Market Lever**
> "I'm in final rounds with Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler for senior Solutions Architect roles, both offering total packages above $300,000. Netskope's UZTNA platform story is stronger, but I need the compensation to be competitive at $310,000+ Year 1."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $205,000 base + $220,000 RSU (4-year) + $32,000 signing bonus. Solutions Architects at post-IPO security companies carry outsized revenue influence — frame every ask around deal impact. If they counter at $185,000 base, push for 2,000 RSU shares and a $25,000 signing bonus. Reference competing offers from Palo Alto Networks or Zscaler at $300,000+ total comp. Your accept-at floor should be $180,000 base + $150,000 RSU (4-year) + $20,000 signing bonus, yielding ~$240,000 Year 1 total compensation.
