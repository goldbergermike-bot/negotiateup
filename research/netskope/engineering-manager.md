As an Engineering Manager at Netskope, you lead teams building the Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) platform that has driven the company to $754M ARR with 34% year-over-year growth.

### Netskope UZTNA & Modernized Network Consolidation Lever

Since Netskope's September 2025 IPO, the company has operated under public-market expectations for consistent execution. With $754M ARR and 34% growth, Netskope must continue shipping features at a pace that sustains its Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) leadership while executing on its Modernized Network Consolidation vision. Engineering Managers are the critical link between strategy and execution — you translate the product roadmap into sprint plans, hire the talent needed to scale platform capabilities, and ensure your team delivers the reliability and performance that enterprise customers demand. Netskope's ability to consolidate legacy network security appliances into a single platform depends entirely on engineering team velocity, which makes your role as Engineering Manager directly tied to revenue growth and market positioning.

#### Global Levers — Negotiation Language

**1. Post-IPO Team Scaling Lever**
> "Netskope's September 2025 IPO and 34% ARR growth mean the engineering organization needs to scale rapidly. I bring a proven track record of building and scaling high-performing teams at [current company], and I'm asking for $240,000 base salary to reflect the premium on engineering management talent in the post-IPO growth phase."

**2. UZTNA Delivery Ownership Lever**
> "As an Engineering Manager on the UZTNA platform, I'll be directly accountable for the features that drive Netskope's $754M ARR. My teams will build the capabilities that win competitive deals against Zscaler and Palo Alto. I'm requesting $350,000 in RSUs over four years to align my compensation with this revenue-generating responsibility."

**3. Modernized Network Consolidation Hiring Lever**
> "Netskope's Modernized Network Consolidation strategy requires hiring specialized engineers at scale — a challenge I've successfully managed in previous roles. Given the difficulty of recruiting UZTNA-skilled engineers, I'd like a $45,000 signing bonus to offset my forfeited equity and enable me to start building your team immediately."

**4. Competitive Management Offer Lever**
> "I'm in final rounds with CrowdStrike and Fortinet for engineering management roles, both offering total packages above $390,000. I believe Netskope's platform vision is more compelling, but I need the compensation to reflect the market rate for this level of management responsibility — targeting $400,000+ Year 1 total comp."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $240,000 base + $350,000 RSU (4-year) + $45,000 signing bonus. Engineering Managers at post-IPO companies command premium compensation because they directly control execution velocity. If they counter at $215,000 base, push for 3,200 RSU shares and a $35,000 signing bonus. Reference competing offers from CrowdStrike or Fortinet at $390,000+ total comp. Your accept-at floor should be $205,000 base + $230,000 RSU (4-year) + $30,000 signing bonus, yielding ~$295,000 Year 1 total compensation.
