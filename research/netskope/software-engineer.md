### Software Engineer | Netskope Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Post-IPO Cloud Security | UZTNA Platform Engineering | $754M ARR & 34% Growth | RSU Equity (Public Stock) | Modernized Network Consolidation

Netskope completed its IPO in September 2025, transitioning from a late-stage private company to a publicly traded cloud security leader. As a Software Engineer, you are building the foundational components of Netskope's Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) platform — the technology that underpins the company's $754M ARR run rate and 34% year-over-year growth. With Netskope driving Modernized Network Consolidation across global enterprises, your engineering contributions directly impact platform reliability, feature velocity, and customer adoption. Post-IPO, your RSU grants carry liquid, publicly traded value — a significant shift from the pre-IPO equity model that demands updated negotiation tactics.

### Netskope UZTNA & Modernized Network Consolidation Lever

Netskope's September 2025 IPO validated its position as the leader in Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA), a category the company has defined and dominated. With $754M ARR growing at 34% year-over-year, Netskope is executing a Modernized Network Consolidation strategy that replaces legacy security appliances with a unified cloud-native platform. As a Software Engineer, you are building the core services that power this consolidation — every microservice, API, and data pipeline you deliver accelerates Netskope's ability to displace incumbents like Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks. Use this platform momentum as your primary negotiation lever: the company's growth trajectory means engineering talent is the bottleneck, and your contributions have direct revenue impact.

#### Global Levers — Negotiation Language

**1. Post-IPO Equity Liquidity Lever**
> "Netskope's September 2025 IPO means my RSU grants now vest into publicly traded shares with immediate liquidity. I'd like to discuss increasing my RSU allocation to $140,000 over four years, reflecting the reduced risk profile of public equity compared to pre-IPO grants."

**2. UZTNA Platform Scarcity Lever**
> "Engineers with cloud-native security platform experience are exceptionally scarce. Netskope's UZTNA architecture requires specialized skills in zero trust networking, and I bring direct experience building similar distributed security systems. I'm asking for a base salary of $170,000 to reflect this market scarcity."

**3. Growth Trajectory Lever**
> "With $754M ARR and 34% growth, Netskope is scaling rapidly and needs to ship features faster to maintain its leadership position. I want to ensure my compensation reflects the intensity and impact of this growth phase — specifically a signing bonus of $25,000 to offset the equity I'm leaving behind at my current employer."

**4. Competitive Offer Lever**
> "I'm also in late-stage conversations with Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler, both of whom are competing for the same zero trust engineering talent. Their offers are competitive, and I'd like Netskope to match or exceed my strongest alternative at $235,000 total first-year compensation."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $170,000 base + $140,000 RSU (4-year) + $25,000 signing bonus. Anchor your RSU ask on the post-IPO liquidity premium — public Netskope shares are worth more in risk-adjusted terms than pre-IPO equity. If they counter at $155,000 base, push for 1,200 RSU shares and a $20,000 signing bonus. Reference competing offers from Palo Alto Networks or Zscaler at $230,000+ total comp. Your accept-at floor should be $155,000 base + $100,000 RSU (4-year) + $15,000 signing bonus, yielding ~$195,000 Year 1 total compensation.
