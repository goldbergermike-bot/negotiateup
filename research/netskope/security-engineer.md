### Security Engineer | Netskope Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Post-IPO Cloud Security | UZTNA Security Architecture | $754M ARR & 34% Growth | RSU Equity (Public Stock) | Modernized Network Consolidation

Netskope's September 2025 IPO put the company's own security posture under a magnifying glass — a security company must be unimpeachable on its own security. As a Security Engineer, you protect Netskope's Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) platform, its internal systems, and its customers' data. At $754M ARR with 34% growth, you are safeguarding the infrastructure that processes sensitive enterprise traffic for thousands of global organizations. The Modernized Network Consolidation strategy means customers are entrusting more of their security stack to Netskope, raising the stakes for platform security. Post-IPO RSU grants vest into publicly traded Netskope stock, and any security incident would have immediate stock price consequences — making your role both high-impact and high-visibility.

### Netskope UZTNA & Modernized Network Consolidation Lever

Netskope's September 2025 IPO amplified the stakes for its security engineering team. At $754M ARR with 34% growth, the Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) platform is the trust foundation for thousands of enterprises — a single breach or vulnerability would devastate customer confidence and stock price. Security Engineers at Netskope operate at the intersection of product security, infrastructure security, and compliance — ensuring the platform that sells zero trust actually embodies zero trust. As customers adopt the Modernized Network Consolidation strategy and move more of their security stack to Netskope, the attack surface and the trust placed in the platform both expand. Security engineers who understand cloud-native security architecture, threat modeling, and compliance frameworks at scale are among the hardest hires in the industry.

#### Global Levers — Negotiation Language

**1. Platform Trust Lever**
> "Netskope sells zero trust — its own platform security must be beyond reproach. A single incident would undermine $754M ARR in customer relationships. As a Security Engineer, I'm protecting the company's most valuable asset: customer trust. I'm targeting $210,000 base salary to reflect the existential importance of this role."

**2. Post-IPO Security Scrutiny Lever**
> "Since Netskope's September 2025 IPO, the company faces heightened scrutiny from regulators, auditors, and customers. With 34% growth, the security team must scale to match. I'm requesting $240,000 in RSUs over four years — a grant that reflects the public-company premium on security engineering talent."

**3. Modernized Network Consolidation Trust Lever**
> "Netskope's Modernized Network Consolidation strategy asks customers to replace multiple security tools with a single platform. They'll only do this if Netskope's security posture is demonstrably superior. I bring specific expertise in cloud-native security architecture and compliance at scale, and I'd like a $35,000 signing bonus to offset my forfeited equity."

**4. Competitive Security Engineering Lever**
> "I'm evaluating offers from CrowdStrike and Google's security team, both above $310,000 total comp. Netskope's UZTNA platform is the most interesting security challenge in the market, but I need the total package to be competitive at $320,000+ Year 1."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $210,000 base + $240,000 RSU (4-year) + $35,000 signing bonus. Security engineers at security companies command top-of-market compensation because their role is existential. If they counter at $190,000 base, push for 2,200 RSU shares and a $28,000 signing bonus. Reference competing offers from CrowdStrike or Google at $310,000+ total comp. Your accept-at floor should be $185,000 base + $170,000 RSU (4-year) + $22,000 signing bonus, yielding ~$250,000 Year 1 total compensation.
