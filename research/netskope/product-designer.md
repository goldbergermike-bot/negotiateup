### Product Designer | Netskope Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Post-IPO Cloud Security | UZTNA Platform UX | $754M ARR & 34% Growth | RSU Equity (Public Stock) | Modernized Network Consolidation

Netskope's September 2025 IPO marked a pivotal moment for its design organization — the company's Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) platform now serves thousands of enterprise customers, and the user experience you design directly impacts adoption, retention, and expansion revenue. At $754M ARR with 34% growth, Netskope is investing heavily in design to differentiate its Modernized Network Consolidation platform from competitors. Product Designers at Netskope own the end-to-end experience of security administration, policy management, and analytics dashboards — complex enterprise workflows where design quality is a competitive moat. Post-IPO RSU grants vest into publicly traded shares, giving your compensation a liquid equity component tied to the platform you design.

### Netskope UZTNA & Modernized Network Consolidation Lever

Netskope's September 2025 IPO elevated design from a support function to a strategic differentiator. The Unified Zero Trust Network Access (UZTNA) platform has reached $754M ARR with 34% growth, but sustaining that trajectory requires a product experience that simplifies the complexity of Modernized Network Consolidation for security administrators. Customers are replacing five or six legacy appliances with Netskope's unified platform, and the design of that consolidated experience determines whether customers expand or churn. Product Designers at Netskope don't just make things look good — they solve hard interaction design problems that directly influence deal outcomes and net revenue retention. Enterprise security UX specialists are rare, and your ability to design intuitive workflows for complex zero trust policies is a skill Netskope cannot easily find elsewhere.

#### Global Levers — Negotiation Language

**1. Enterprise UX Specialization Lever**
> "Enterprise security product design is a niche specialty — designers who can simplify zero trust policy management for Netskope's UZTNA platform are exceptionally rare. I'm targeting $190,000 base salary to reflect the premium the market places on this combination of enterprise UX depth and security domain expertise."

**2. Post-IPO Design Investment Lever**
> "With Netskope's September 2025 IPO and $754M ARR growing at 34%, the company is clearly investing in product experience as a competitive differentiator. I'm requesting $180,000 in RSUs over four years — an equity grant that reflects the direct connection between design quality and customer retention in a post-IPO environment."

**3. Modernized Network Consolidation UX Lever**
> "Netskope's Modernized Network Consolidation strategy means customers are replacing multiple legacy tools with a single platform. Designing that unified experience — making it intuitive enough that security teams actually consolidate — is a design challenge with direct revenue impact. I'd like a $28,000 signing bonus to offset my current unvested equity."

**4. Competitive Design Market Lever**
> "I have active offers from Figma and Datadog for senior product design roles, both offering total packages above $265,000. Netskope's UZTNA platform presents a more complex and interesting design challenge, but I need the compensation to match at $270,000+ Year 1 total comp."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $190,000 base + $180,000 RSU (4-year) + $28,000 signing bonus. Designers at post-IPO security companies are increasingly valued as enterprise UX becomes a competitive differentiator. If they counter at $170,000 base, push for 1,600 RSU shares and a $20,000 signing bonus. Reference competing offers from Figma or Datadog at $265,000+ total comp. Your accept-at floor should be $165,000 base + $130,000 RSU (4-year) + $18,000 signing bonus, yielding ~$215,000 Year 1 total compensation.
