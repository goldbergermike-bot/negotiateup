### Data Scientist | Deutsche Bank Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** EUR30B market cap European bank + Quant analytics across global markets and risk + Frankfurt/NYC dual hub + NYC pays competitive US rates | DB DS spans European regulatory and quantitative finance | **EUROPEAN QUANT ANALYTICS PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $145K–$205K | $42K–$110K/yr | 18–28% | $198K–$325K |
| London | £98K–£148K | £30K–£78K/yr | 18–28% | £132K–£235K |
| Frankfurt (HQ) | EUR88K–EUR130K | EUR25K–EUR65K/yr | 18–28% | EUR118K–EUR200K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Deutsche Bank apply quantitative modeling across investment banking, risk management, regulatory compliance, and private banking. DB's European heritage creates unique DS challenges: models must comply with ECB/EBA stress testing frameworks, TRIM (Targeted Review of Internal Models), and Basel III/IV requirements that differ from US equivalents. NYC-based DS roles earn US-competitive compensation while providing European regulatory expertise.

DS roles hold VP or SVP titles with compensation as base plus discretionary bonus (18-28%) plus deferred compensation. DS compensation at DB's NYC hub is competitive with US banks. Competition comes from hedge funds, Big Tech, and other banks. DB's European quant challenges provide unique career differentiation.

**Level Mapping:** Data Scientist at DB (VP/SVP) = L4-L5 at Google, IC4-IC5 at Meta, Applied Scientist at Amazon, VP/SVP at BofA, VP/ED at Goldman Sachs

**The European Quantitative Finance Premium**

DB's data science challenges include modeling under European regulatory frameworks (TRIM, ECB stress testing, Basel III/IV) that create unique intellectual challenges. Data scientists with experience in European regulatory modeling are in exceptional demand, as few professionals have both deep quantitative skills and European regulatory domain knowledge.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Two Sigma/Goldman Sachs/Google] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to DB's European quant challenges, but the compensation gap is significant."
2. **European Regulatory Expertise:** "My experience with [ECB stress testing/Basel III modeling/TRIM compliance] is directly applicable and extremely scarce."
3. **Revenue Impact:** "Quantitative models across trading, risk, and client analytics directly impact DB's global P&L."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[40K-70K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about DB's quantitative challenges. I have a competing offer from [Goldman Sachs/Two Sigma] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose DB, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $55K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
