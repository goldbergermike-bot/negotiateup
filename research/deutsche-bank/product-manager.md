### Product Manager | Deutsche Bank Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** EUR30B market cap European bank + PM drives products across European and global markets + Frankfurt/NYC dual hub + NYC pays competitive US rates | DB PMs shape international banking products | **EUROPEAN BANKING PM PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $148K–$208K | $42K–$110K/yr | 18–30% | $200K–$330K |
| London | £100K–£150K | £32K–£78K/yr | 18–30% | £140K–£238K |
| Frankfurt (HQ) | EUR88K–EUR132K | EUR25K–EUR65K/yr | 18–30% | EUR118K–EUR205K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Deutsche Bank own strategy and execution for banking products spanning investment banking platforms (Autobahn), corporate banking solutions, private banking services, and retail banking in Germany. PMs must navigate European regulatory frameworks, multi-market product requirements, and the intersection of traditional banking with digital innovation. NYC-based PMs earn US-competitive compensation.

PMs hold SVP or Director titles with compensation as base plus discretionary bonus (18-30%) plus deferred compensation. DB's product organization has been modernizing, adopting agile practices while maintaining European banking governance. PMs working on revenue-generating platforms (trading, payments) typically earn higher bonuses.

**Level Mapping:** PM at DB (SVP/Director) = L5-L6 at Google, IC5-IC6 at Meta, Sr PM-Principal PM at Amazon, SVP/Director at BofA, SVP/ED at Goldman Sachs

**The International Banking Product Premium**

PM at DB requires navigating European regulatory approval processes, multi-jurisdiction product launches, and cross-border product architecture. This international product management experience is rare and highly valued by global organizations. PMs gain exposure to European banking products and regulatory frameworks that US-focused PMs never encounter.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Goldman Sachs/Google/Stripe] at $[X] total comp for a PM role. I'm drawn to DB's international scope, but the compensation needs to be competitive."
2. **International Product Expertise:** "My experience with [international product launches/European regulatory products/cross-border banking] is directly applicable."
3. **Revenue Impact:** "As PM for [product line], I'd directly impact products generating [X] in revenue."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[40K-68K] would bridge the transition."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about DB's international products. I have a competing offer from [Goldman Sachs/Google] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose DB, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $52K. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
