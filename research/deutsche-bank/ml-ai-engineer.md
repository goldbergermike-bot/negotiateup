### ML/AI Engineer | Deutsche Bank Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** EUR30B market cap European bank + AI across trading, risk, and compliance + Frankfurt/NYC dual hub + NYC pays competitive US rates | DB ML spans European regulatory AI challenges | **EUROPEAN AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $148K–$208K | $42K–$115K/yr | 18–28% | $200K–$335K |
| London | £102K–£150K | £32K–£82K/yr | 18–28% | £140K–£242K |
| Frankfurt (HQ) | EUR90K–EUR135K | EUR26K–EUR68K/yr | 18–28% | EUR122K–EUR210K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Deutsche Bank deploy machine learning across trading analytics, credit risk modeling, fraud detection, regulatory compliance (including AML/KYC), and client analytics. DB's European footprint creates unique ML challenges: models must comply with the EU AI Act, GDPR algorithmic decision-making requirements, and European regulatory frameworks for model governance. NYC-based ML engineers earn US-competitive compensation while gaining European AI regulatory expertise.

ML roles hold VP or SVP titles with compensation as base plus discretionary bonus (18-28%) plus deferred compensation. ML compensation at DB runs 10-15% above SWE bands. The bank has been investing in AI capabilities as part of its technology strategy.

**Level Mapping:** ML/AI Engineer at DB (VP/SVP) = L4-L5 at Google, E4-E5 at Meta, Applied Scientist at Amazon, VP/SVP at BofA, VP/ED at Goldman Sachs

**The EU AI Regulatory Premium**

Deutsche Bank's ML engineers must navigate the EU AI Act -- the world's most comprehensive AI regulation -- alongside existing GDPR algorithmic decision-making requirements. This creates demand for ML engineers who can build models that satisfy both performance requirements and European regulatory constraints. As the EU AI Act becomes the global template for AI regulation, this expertise becomes increasingly valuable worldwide.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Goldman Sachs/Two Sigma] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to DB's European AI challenges, but the compensation gap is material."
2. **EU AI Regulatory Expertise:** "My experience with [EU AI Act compliance/GDPR ML/European model governance] is directly applicable and extremely scarce."
3. **Revenue Impact:** "ML models in trading, risk, and compliance directly impact DB's global P&L."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[40K-68K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about DB's ML challenges. I have a competing offer from [Google/Goldman Sachs] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose DB, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $52K. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
