**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Deutsche Bank coordinate technology programs spanning EU, US, and Asian operations. DB TPMs (SVP or Director titles) manage programs including global platform migrations, European regulatory technology implementations (DORA, MiFID II), and cross-border infrastructure modernization. The international scope adds complexity layers -- coordinating across time zones, regulatory jurisdictions, work council structures, and cultural contexts.

Compensation follows the banking model: base plus discretionary bonus (18-28%) plus deferred compensation. NYC-based TPMs earn US-competitive packages. DB's international program scope provides career-defining experience.

**Level Mapping:** TPM at DB (SVP/Director) = L5-L6 TPM at Google, E5-E6 TPM at Meta, Sr TPM-Principal TPM at Amazon, SVP/Director TPM at BofA, SVP/ED at Goldman Sachs

**The International Banking Program Premium**

DB TPMs manage programs that must satisfy regulators in multiple jurisdictions simultaneously, coordinate delivery across European and US work cultures, and navigate European co-determination structures. This international program management complexity is unique and provides career differentiation that domestic-only TPMs lack.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Amazon/Goldman Sachs] at $[X] total comp for a TPM role. I'm interested in DB's international programs, but the compensation needs to be competitive."
2. **International Program Expertise:** "My experience managing [international/multi-jurisdiction/European banking] programs is directly applicable and scarce."
3. **Program Scale:** "Managing programs across EU, US, and Asia with multi-jurisdiction regulatory compliance warrants Director-level compensation."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[38K-62K] would bridge the transition."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about DB's international programs. I have a competing offer from [Google/Goldman Sachs] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose DB, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $48K. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
