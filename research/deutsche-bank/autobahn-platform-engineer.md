**Negotiation DNA**

Autobahn is Deutsche Bank's flagship electronic trading and distribution platform, serving institutional clients across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities globally. Autobahn Platform Engineers build and maintain the low-latency trading infrastructure, pricing engines, risk calculation systems, and client-facing interfaces that power one of Europe's largest investment banks' electronic trading operations. The platform handles billions in daily trading volume and is critical to DB's institutional revenue.

Engineers on Autobahn typically hold VP or Director titles in DB's NYC or London tech hubs, with compensation structured as base plus discretionary bonus (20-35% at VP, 30-50%+ at Director) plus deferred compensation. DB's NYC tech hub competes directly with Wall Street banks and hedge funds for trading platform talent, driving NYC compensation to US market rates despite DB being a European bank. Frankfurt-based roles are compensated at competitive European rates with strong benefits.

Competition comes from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Citadel Securities, and hedge funds. DB's Autobahn platform provides unique experience in building electronic trading systems at a global European bank, offering exposure to European markets, regulatory frameworks (MiFID II), and trading products that US-centric firms don't cover.

**Level Mapping:** Autobahn Platform Engineer at DB (VP/Director) = L5-L6 at Google, E5-E6 at Meta, SDE III-Principal at Amazon, VP/SVP at BofA, VP/ED at Goldman Sachs

**The European Investment Banking Technology Premium**

Deutsche Bank's Autobahn platform provides exposure to European electronic trading markets -- including MiFID II-regulated venues, European government bond markets, and FX trading -- that US-focused banks and funds don't cover as deeply. This European market expertise creates unique career value. DB's NYC tech hub operates at US compensation standards, which means engineers earn Wall Street-competitive packages while gaining European market experience. The platform's global scope (serving clients across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC) creates engineering challenges around multi-venue connectivity, cross-border regulatory compliance, and 24-hour trading coverage.

DB's ongoing technology transformation includes significant investment in modernizing Autobahn's architecture, creating opportunities for engineers to work on cutting-edge low-latency systems, cloud migration, and API modernization. Engineers who can bridge legacy trading systems with modern architectures are in particularly high demand.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Goldman Sachs/Citadel Securities/JPMorgan] at $[X] total comp for a trading platform role. I'm drawn to Autobahn's global scope, but the compensation gap needs to be addressed. Can we increase the base to $[target] and guarantee the first-year bonus at [X]%?"
2. **Revenue Attribution:** "Autobahn directly enables billions in daily trading revenue. Given this revenue impact, a guaranteed bonus of [X]% and base of $[target] is well-justified."
3. **Low-Latency Expertise:** "My experience building [low-latency trading systems/electronic market making platforms/real-time risk engines] commands $[X] at US bulge bracket banks and quant funds."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested deferred comp/equity. A sign-on of $[50K-85K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about Autobahn's global trading platform. I have a competing offer from [Goldman Sachs/Citadel] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose DB, I'd need the base at $[X+20K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+10]%, and a sign-on of $65K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], the competing offer is more compelling."
