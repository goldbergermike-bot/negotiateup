### Security Engineer | Deutsche Bank Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** EUR30B market cap European bank + Security across EU/US/Asia banking infrastructure + Frankfurt/NYC dual hub + NYC pays competitive US rates | DB security spans European and global threat landscapes | **EUROPEAN BANKING SECURITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Deutsche Bank protect banking infrastructure across European, US, and Asian markets against sophisticated threat actors. DB's security challenges include compliance with DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act), GDPR data protection requirements, BaFin IT security mandates, and NY DFS 500 in the US. The multi-jurisdiction regulatory environment creates security engineering challenges that are unique to international European banks.

Security Engineers hold VP or SVP titles with compensation as base plus discretionary bonus (18-28%) plus deferred compensation. NYC-based roles earn US-competitive security packages. DB has been investing in cybersecurity as regulatory requirements around digital operational resilience intensify.

**Level Mapping:** Security Engineer at DB (VP/SVP) = L4-L5 at Google, E4-E5 at Meta, SecEng II-Senior at Amazon, VP/SVP at BofA, VP/ED at Goldman Sachs

**The European Regulatory Security Premium**

DB security engineers must navigate DORA, GDPR, and European banking security mandates that are among the strictest in the world. This European regulatory security expertise is increasingly valuable globally as other jurisdictions adopt similar frameworks. The multi-jurisdiction security compliance challenge creates career-differentiating experience.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [CrowdStrike/Goldman Sachs/Google] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to DB's European security challenges, but the compensation needs to be competitive."
2. **European Security Expertise:** "My experience with [DORA compliance/GDPR security/European banking security mandates] is directly applicable and scarce."
3. **Multi-Jurisdiction Security:** "Defending banking infrastructure across EU, US, and Asian regulatory environments is uniquely complex."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[38K-62K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about DB's global security challenges. I have a competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Goldman Sachs] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose DB, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $48K. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
