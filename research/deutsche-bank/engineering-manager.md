### Engineering Manager | Deutsche Bank Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** EUR30B market cap European bank + Managing global engineering teams across EU/US/Asia + Frankfurt/NYC dual hub + NYC pays competitive US rates | DB EMs lead truly international engineering organizations | **GLOBAL EUROPEAN LEADERSHIP PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $168K–$232K | $55K–$140K/yr | 20–35% | $235K–$385K |
| London | £112K–£165K | £40K–£100K/yr | 20–35% | £160K–£275K |
| Frankfurt (HQ) | EUR100K–EUR150K | EUR32K–EUR80K/yr | 20–35% | EUR138K–EUR240K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Deutsche Bank lead technology teams across a truly international bank with major tech hubs in Frankfurt, London, NYC, Singapore, and Bangalore. EMs (SVP or Director titles) must navigate European work culture, German co-determination frameworks, cross-border team dynamics, and multi-jurisdiction regulatory requirements. This international management complexity is unique among major banks and provides career-differentiating experience.

Compensation is bonus-weighted in banking tradition: base plus discretionary bonus (20-35% at SVP, 30-50% at Director) plus deferred compensation. NYC-based EMs earn US-competitive packages. DB's German corporate culture offers work-life balance advantages and strong employee protections, including generous PTO and parental leave.

**Level Mapping:** Engineering Manager at DB (SVP/Director) = L6-L7 at Google, M1-M2 at Meta, SDM-Principal SDM at Amazon, SVP/Director at BofA, SVP/MD at Goldman Sachs

**The International Banking Leadership Premium**

Leading engineering teams at DB requires navigating European work council structures, German labor law, and cross-cultural team dynamics that US-focused banks don't encounter. This international management experience is highly valued by global organizations and creates career optionality across both US and European markets. DB EMs who succeed in this complex environment develop leadership skills that command premium compensation throughout their careers.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Goldman Sachs/Google/JPMorgan] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to DB's international scope, but the compensation gap is significant."
2. **International Leadership:** "Managing engineering teams across US, EU, and Asia requires exceptional leadership skills. This global scope warrants Director-level compensation."
3. **Transformation Track Record:** "My experience leading technology transformations at [company] with [results] justifies an above-band package."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[50K-85K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about leading DB's international engineering teams. I have a competing offer from [Goldman Sachs/Google] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose DB, I'd need the base at $[X+20K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $65K. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
