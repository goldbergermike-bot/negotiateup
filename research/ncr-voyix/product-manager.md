**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at NCR Voyix are not managing incremental feature backlogs — they are defining the product strategy for a company in the middle of a fundamental platform transformation. The Atleos spin-off separated the ATM hardware business, leaving Voyix as a pure-play commerce technology company serving restaurant, retail, and digital banking verticals. PMs here own the product direction for cloud-native microservices that replace decades-old POS monoliths. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch in January 2026 was the product organization's flagship moment, and the roadmap ahead requires PMs who can balance merchant needs, technical feasibility, and the Modernization Inflection narrative that drives investor confidence in NYSE: VYX.

Voyix Insight — the company's Conversational AI product for commerce — represents the highest-profile PM opportunity. Defining how merchants interact with AI-powered analytics, conversational ordering, and predictive inventory requires product thinking that spans AI capabilities, merchant workflows, and commerce economics. PMs who bring experience in AI product development, vertical SaaS, or commerce technology are in high demand. The Atlanta hub houses the core product organization, and Voyix competes with Toast, Block, Shopify, and enterprise competitors like Oracle for this talent.

Your negotiation leverage as a PM is proportional to your domain expertise. If you bring deep knowledge of restaurant technology, retail operations, or digital banking — combined with experience shipping cloud-native products at scale — you represent exactly the PM profile that the Modernization Inflection strategy demands. The $3.5B+ revenue base means merchants are already on the platform; the PM challenge is migrating them to the new architecture while expanding the product surface area through innovations like Voyix Insight.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — NRF 2026 Product Momentum:** "The NRF 2026 Microservices launch was a product milestone, not just an engineering milestone. The PM who owns the next phase of platform rollout is shaping how thousands of merchants experience the transition to cloud-native commerce. I'd like the base adjusted to $170,000 to reflect the scope of this product mandate — this is a platform-defining role, not a feature PM role."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight Product Vision:** "Voyix Insight is the product that differentiates Voyix from every legacy POS competitor. Defining the Conversational AI experience for merchants — from natural language analytics to predictive operations — requires a PM with AI product experience and deep commerce domain knowledge. I bring both. I'm requesting an RSU grant of $90,000 over four years to align my incentives with Voyix Insight's market trajectory."

**Lever 3 — Modernization Inflection Product Strategy:** "The Modernization Inflection is fundamentally a product strategy — it requires convincing merchants that the cloud-native platform delivers more value than the legacy systems they know. I've led similar migration-driven product strategies at [company], achieving [X]% adoption within [Y] months. That playbook directly applies here, and I'd like a $15,000 signing bonus to reflect the accelerated time-to-impact."

**Lever 4 — Atlanta Commerce Tech PM Scarcity:** "Product managers with both commerce domain expertise and cloud-native platform experience are scarce in the Atlanta market. My competing offer from a commerce SaaS company values this combination at $185,000 base. I prefer the scale and complexity of the Voyix platform, but I need the compensation to reflect the market value of this skill set."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with a $20,000-$25,000 base increase request, anchored to the NRF 2026 product momentum and Modernization Inflection product strategy ownership. PMs should emphasize that their product decisions directly impact merchant migration rates — the key metric driving VYX investor confidence. If base is constrained, request $80,000-$100,000 in RSU (up from ~$60,000 midpoint) and frame it through Voyix Insight's multi-year product roadmap. A $15,000 signing bonus is reasonable given PM scarcity in commerce technology. Accept-at floor: $155,000 base / $60,000 RSU in Atlanta; $175,000 base / $80,000 RSU in New York. Frame the negotiation around the Modernization Inflection thesis: product managers translate the transformation strategy into merchant-facing reality.
