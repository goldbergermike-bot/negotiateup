**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at NCR Voyix build the pipelines, warehouses, and streaming infrastructure that transform raw commerce transactions into the structured datasets that power the entire business — from merchant analytics dashboards to the Voyix Insight Conversational AI product. With tens of thousands of merchant locations generating transaction data across restaurant, retail, and digital banking verticals, the data engineering challenge at Voyix is genuinely massive. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch introduced event-driven data architectures that generate orders of magnitude more telemetry and behavioral data than the legacy POS systems they replace. Data engineers are building the infrastructure to capture, process, and serve that data at scale.

The Modernization Inflection has a critical data engineering dependency. Legacy POS systems stored data in local databases with limited centralization; the cloud-native platform centralizes data in real-time streaming pipelines and cloud data warehouses. Data engineers must design the migration path for historical merchant data while simultaneously building the new real-time data infrastructure. This dual challenge — migrating legacy data and building new pipelines — requires engineers who understand both traditional ETL patterns and modern streaming architectures (Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming).

Voyix Insight is entirely dependent on data engineering. The Conversational AI product cannot provide merchant insights without clean, timely, well-structured data flowing through production pipelines. Data engineers who build reliable, low-latency pipelines that feed Voyix Insight are directly enabling the company's most visible AI product. The Atlanta hub is the center of data engineering operations, and the team works closely with data science, AI/ML engineering, and platform engineering. The RSU component offers meaningful upside as the data platform matures and drives VYX revenue growth through data-powered products like Voyix Insight.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — NRF 2026 Data Architecture Scale:** "The NRF 2026 Microservices launch introduced event-driven architectures that generate an order of magnitude more data than legacy POS systems. Building the data infrastructure to capture, process, and serve that data at scale is the foundation for every data product Voyix delivers. I'd like the base adjusted to $165,000 to reflect the scale and complexity of this data engineering challenge."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight Data Pipeline Ownership:** "Voyix Insight is only as good as the data that feeds it. I'll be building the real-time streaming pipelines and feature engineering infrastructure that power the Conversational AI product. My experience building production data pipelines at [company] — processing [X] million events per day with sub-second latency — directly translates. I'm requesting an RSU grant of $65,000 over four years to align with the long-term value of the data platform I'll build."

**Lever 3 — Modernization Inflection Data Migration:** "The Modernization Inflection requires migrating years of historical merchant data from legacy POS databases to the cloud-native data platform — while simultaneously building new real-time pipelines. This dual challenge requires engineers who understand both traditional ETL and modern streaming architectures. I bring both, and I'd like a $12,000 signing bonus to reflect the immediate productivity this dual expertise enables."

**Lever 4 — Commerce Data Domain Expertise:** "Data engineers who understand commerce transaction data — basket-level analytics, payment processing flows, multi-location aggregation, vertical-specific metrics — are scarce. Most data engineering talent works with ad-tech clickstreams or social media engagement data. My commerce data experience means I can design pipelines that serve real merchant needs from day one. I'm asking for total first-year comp of $225,000 in Atlanta."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with a $15,000-$20,000 base increase, anchored to NRF 2026 data architecture scale and Voyix Insight pipeline ownership. Data engineers should quantify their past pipeline impact (e.g., "built a streaming pipeline processing 50M events/day that reduced dashboard latency from 15 minutes to 30 seconds"). If base is constrained, push for $55,000-$70,000 in RSU over four years and a $12,000 signing bonus. Emphasize that the Voyix Insight product roadmap is entirely dependent on data engineering — without reliable pipelines, the AI product cannot function. Accept-at floor: $145,000 base / $40,000 RSU in Atlanta; $170,000 base / $55,000 RSU in New York. Frame through the Modernization Inflection data migration lens — you are building the data foundation that makes the cloud-native commerce platform intelligent.
