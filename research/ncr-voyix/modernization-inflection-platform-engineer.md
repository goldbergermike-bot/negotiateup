**Negotiation DNA**

The Modernization Inflection Platform Engineer is the signature role of NCR Voyix's transformation — the engineer who sits at the exact boundary between legacy and cloud-native, designing and building the platform services, migration frameworks, and architectural patterns that enable tens of thousands of merchant deployments to transition from decades-old POS monoliths to the new cloud-native microservices commerce platform. This is the role that the company's entire Modernization Inflection thesis depends on. Without engineers who can bridge the legacy world and the cloud-native future, the platform migration stalls, merchant revenue remains locked in legacy systems, and the VYX investor narrative collapses.

The NRF 2026 Microservices launch in January 2026 was the public proof point — demonstrating that the cloud-native platform is production-ready. But readiness and migration are fundamentally different challenges. The NRF demo showed the destination; Modernization Inflection Platform Engineers build the road. They design migration tooling that translates legacy POS configurations into cloud-native service deployments. They build compatibility layers that allow merchants to gradually adopt microservices without a disruptive "big bang" migration. They instrument the migration process to measure adoption velocity, identify blockers, and optimize the path for each vertical — because a restaurant migrating from legacy NCR Aloha POS has fundamentally different requirements than a retailer migrating from NCR Counterpoint or a bank migrating from NCR Digital Banking.

The Atleos spin-off crystallized this role's importance. With the ATM hardware business separated, NCR Voyix is a pure-play commerce technology company — and the speed of the legacy-to-cloud migration directly determines the company's revenue quality and growth trajectory. Wall Street analysts track cloud-native revenue as a percentage of total revenue; every merchant that migrates improves that ratio. Modernization Inflection Platform Engineers are the engineers who move that metric. They work at the intersection of platform engineering, systems architecture, data migration, and developer experience — building the internal tools and frameworks that make migration repeatable, reliable, and fast.

Voyix Insight — the company's Conversational AI product — adds another dimension to this role. The Modernization Inflection Platform Engineer must ensure that migrated merchants automatically gain access to Voyix Insight capabilities. The migration path is not just about moving merchants from legacy to cloud-native; it is about moving them from a dumb terminal to an intelligent commerce platform. The engineer who designs that migration path — ensuring that Voyix Insight is available on day one of a merchant's cloud-native deployment — directly drives the value proposition that convinces merchants to migrate in the first place.

The Atlanta hub is the center of gravity for this role, with the core platform engineering team co-located with architecture leadership, data engineering, and the Voyix Insight AI/ML team. The Modernization Inflection Platform Engineer operates at a senior-to-staff IC level, with architectural authority over the migration framework and significant influence on platform-wide technical decisions. This is not a role for engineers who want to work on a single microservice — it requires systems-level thinking, deep understanding of both legacy and modern architectures, and the ability to design abstractions that make complex migration problems tractable.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

This section details eight specific negotiation levers for the signature Modernization Inflection Platform Engineer role. Each lever targets a different dimension of the role's strategic value to NCR Voyix's transformation thesis.

**Lever 1 — The Migration Revenue Multiplier:** "Every merchant I migrate from legacy POS to the cloud-native platform directly improves Voyix's revenue quality — cloud-native subscriptions carry higher margins, lower churn, and better expansion economics than legacy licenses. I am the engineer who moves the metric that Wall Street analysts track most closely: cloud-native revenue as a percentage of total revenue. My base should reflect this direct revenue impact. I'd like it adjusted to $215,000 to align with the strategic leverage this role carries — this is not general platform engineering, this is the specific engineering that drives the company's most important financial transformation."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight Migration Activation:** "The Modernization Inflection is not just about moving merchants to cloud-native infrastructure — it's about moving them to an intelligent commerce platform powered by Voyix Insight. I will design the migration path so that every merchant gains access to Conversational AI capabilities on day one of their cloud-native deployment. This means the migration itself becomes a Voyix Insight activation event, directly driving product adoption for the company's highest-value feature. I'm requesting an RSU grant of $140,000 over four years — the work I do will directly impact the adoption curve for Voyix Insight, and my incentives should align with that long-term value creation for VYX shareholders."

**Lever 3 — NRF 2026 Post-Launch Migration Execution:** "The NRF 2026 Microservices launch proved the platform works in demo environments. I'm the engineer who proves it works at production scale across thousands of merchant deployments with decades of legacy data, custom configurations, and real-time transaction requirements. This is a fundamentally harder problem than building a greenfield microservices platform, and it requires a rare combination of legacy systems expertise and cloud-native architecture skills. I'd like a $25,000 signing bonus to offset the opportunity cost of choosing this complex migration challenge over a greenfield platform engineering role at a startup."

**Lever 4 — Multi-Vertical Migration Complexity:** "The Modernization Inflection spans three fundamentally different verticals: restaurant (NCR Aloha), retail (NCR Counterpoint, NCR Voyix Store), and digital banking. Each vertical has distinct legacy architectures, data models, integration requirements, and merchant workflows. The migration framework I build must abstract over these differences while respecting their unique constraints. This multi-vertical complexity is rare in platform engineering — most migration engineers work within a single domain. My experience spanning multiple vertical domains justifies compensation at the top of the band. I'm asking for total first-year comp of $350,000 in Atlanta."

**Lever 5 — Atlanta Hub Platform Architecture Influence:** "The Atlanta hub is where platform architecture decisions are made, and the Modernization Inflection Platform Engineer has outsized influence on those decisions. The migration framework I design will be used by dozens of engineering teams across all three verticals. This architectural influence extends beyond my immediate scope — I'm setting patterns that will shape platform development for years. I'd like the RSU component increased to $150,000 over four years to reflect this long-term architectural impact."

**Lever 6 — Legacy Systems Expertise as Strategic Asset:** "Most engineers avoid legacy systems work. I actively seek it because I understand that the Modernization Inflection can only succeed if someone deeply understands the legacy architectures being replaced. I have worked with [legacy POS/ERP/commerce systems] at [company], understanding their data models, integration patterns, and operational constraints. This legacy expertise is not available on the open market — you cannot hire it from a FAANG company. It must be specifically valued in the compensation package. I'd like the base moved to the top of the band at $220,000."

**Lever 7 — Post-Atleos Pure-Play Focus Premium:** "The Atleos spin-off means that every engineering investment at Voyix goes directly toward the commerce platform — there is no ATM hardware business diluting focus or resources. As a Modernization Inflection Platform Engineer, I benefit directly from this pure-play focus, and the company benefits from my undivided attention on the migration challenge. This strategic alignment deserves a comp package that reflects the company's pure-play commitment. I'm requesting accelerated first-year RSU vesting — 40% in Year 1 instead of the standard 25% — to demonstrate mutual commitment to the migration timeline."

**Lever 8 — Competitive Positioning Against Fiserv and Block:** "Fiserv and Block are both investing in commerce platform modernization. Both would hire me for comparable roles. But Voyix's Modernization Inflection challenge is uniquely compelling because of the scale of the legacy base (tens of thousands of merchant locations), the multi-vertical complexity, and the Voyix Insight AI integration opportunity. I want to be here. But the comp needs to be competitive with what Fiserv and Block offer for equivalent roles — my research indicates that's $200,000-$230,000 base with $120,000-$160,000 in equity. I'd like the Voyix offer to match the midpoint of that range."

### Deep Dive: The Modernization Inflection Platform Engineer's Strategic Value

The Modernization Inflection Platform Engineer occupies a unique position in NCR Voyix's organizational structure. Unlike traditional platform engineers who build and maintain existing infrastructure, this role is explicitly tasked with building the bridge between two worlds: the legacy commerce systems that generate the majority of current revenue, and the cloud-native microservices platform that represents the company's future.

**Why This Role Commands a Premium**

The premium for this role derives from four compounding factors:

First, **technical scarcity**. The engineer must simultaneously understand legacy POS architectures (proprietary protocols, on-premise databases, hardware-specific integrations) and modern cloud-native patterns (microservices, event-driven architecture, container orchestration, service mesh, API-first design). Most engineers specialize in one world or the other. The Modernization Inflection demands fluency in both.

Second, **business criticality**. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch created market expectations that Voyix will deliver a production-grade cloud-native platform. The engineers who build the migration path determine whether Voyix meets those expectations. A failed or slow migration undermines the investor thesis, the merchant value proposition, and the company's competitive position against Fiserv, Block, Toast, and Shopify.

Third, **multi-vertical complexity**. Restaurant, retail, and digital banking each have distinct legacy architectures, regulatory requirements, data models, and merchant expectations. The migration framework must be sophisticated enough to handle this diversity while being simple enough for vertical-specific engineering teams to adopt. This is an architectural design challenge that requires both depth and breadth.

Fourth, **Voyix Insight integration**. The migration path must not only move merchants to cloud-native infrastructure — it must activate Voyix Insight capabilities as part of the migration. This means the platform engineer must understand the AI product's data requirements, API contracts, and operational constraints well enough to design a migration that enables Conversational AI on day one.

**Compensation Philosophy for This Role**

NCR Voyix should expect to compensate Modernization Inflection Platform Engineers at the senior-to-staff level, with total comp packages that compete with Fiserv, Block, and late-stage fintech companies. The role is not interchangeable with general platform engineering — it requires a specific, rare combination of skills that justifies a 15-25% premium over standard platform engineering comp bands.

The RSU component is especially important for this role. Modernization Inflection Platform Engineers are building the infrastructure that directly drives the cloud-native revenue transition — the metric that VYX stock price will track most closely over the next 3-5 years. Front-loaded vesting (40% Year 1) is appropriate and negotiable, as the company benefits from immediate migration velocity and the engineer's architectural decisions have the highest impact in the first 12-18 months.

**Career Trajectory at Voyix**

The Modernization Inflection Platform Engineer role is a launchpad for architectural leadership at Voyix. Engineers who successfully build the migration framework and drive merchant adoption will be natural candidates for Distinguished Engineer, VP of Platform Engineering, or CTO-track roles. The role offers visibility to C-suite leadership, investor relations (migration metrics appear in earnings calls), and the broader commerce technology industry (NRF conference speaking opportunities, technical blog posts, open-source contributions).

This career trajectory should be part of the negotiation conversation. Candidates should ask for explicit commitments around promotion timelines, architectural authority scope, and visibility to senior leadership — these non-comp elements have significant long-term value.

### Negotiation Playbook: Step-by-Step

**Step 1 — Anchor High on Base:** Open the negotiation by requesting $215,000-$220,000 base in Atlanta ($240,000-$250,000 in New York, £150,000-£155,000 in London). Anchor to the migration revenue multiplier lever — you directly improve VYX's most-watched financial metric. The initial offer will likely be $170,000-$185,000 in Atlanta; your anchor sets the negotiation range.

**Step 2 — RSU as Long-Term Alignment:** Request $130,000-$150,000 in RSU over four years, framing it as alignment between your incentives and the Modernization Inflection timeline. Use the Voyix Insight migration activation lever — you are building the path that drives Voyix Insight adoption, and your equity should reflect that long-term value creation.

**Step 3 — Signing Bonus as Transition Cost:** Request a $25,000 signing bonus, framing it as offset for the opportunity cost of choosing the Modernization Inflection challenge over a greenfield platform role at a startup or a higher-paying role at Fiserv/Block. This is a one-time cost for the company and often has more flexibility than base or RSU.

**Step 4 — Vesting Acceleration:** Request 40% first-year vesting instead of the standard 25%. Frame it through mutual commitment — the company needs maximum migration velocity in the first 12-18 months, and front-loaded vesting aligns your incentives with that timeline.

**Step 5 — Non-Comp Negotiation:** Request explicit commitments on architectural authority scope (which platform domains you influence), promotion timeline visibility (path to Distinguished Engineer), conference speaking budget (NRF, KubeCon, QCon), and professional development budget ($5,000-$10,000 annually).

**Step 6 — Accept-At Floor:** If the company cannot meet your full ask, the accept-at floor for this signature role is:
- Atlanta: $195,000 base / $100,000 RSU / $20,000 signing / standard 25% Year 1 vesting
- New York: $220,000 base / $130,000 RSU / $25,000 signing / standard 25% Year 1 vesting
- London: £135,000 base / £70,000 RSU / £15,000 signing / standard 25% Year 1 vesting

Below these floors, the offer does not reflect the strategic value of the Modernization Inflection Platform Engineer role, and you should seriously evaluate competing offers from Fiserv, Block, or growth-stage commerce technology companies.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** This is the signature role of the NCR Voyix transformation — negotiate accordingly. Open by requesting total first-year comp of $350,000-$400,000 in Atlanta ($420,000-$480,000 in New York), anchoring to the migration revenue multiplier and Voyix Insight activation levers. The strongest argument is that Modernization Inflection Platform Engineers directly move the cloud-native revenue percentage metric that drives VYX stock price — this is the most business-critical engineering hire at the company. Request $215,000-$220,000 base, $130,000-$150,000 RSU over four years with 40% Year 1 front-loading, and a $25,000 signing bonus. Use the multi-vertical complexity and legacy systems expertise levers to justify premium positioning above standard platform engineering bands. If the company pushes back on base, hold firm on RSU — this role's impact is long-term and equity alignment is critical. Accept-at floor: $195,000 base / $100,000 RSU / $20,000 signing in Atlanta; $220,000 base / $130,000 RSU / $25,000 signing in New York. Frame the entire negotiation through the Modernization Inflection thesis: you are not filling a headcount, you are architecting the financial transformation that determines whether Voyix succeeds as a pure-play commerce technology company.
