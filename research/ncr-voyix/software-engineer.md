**Negotiation DNA**

NCR Voyix is in the midst of its most consequential transformation since the company's founding. With the Atleos spin-off completed — separating the legacy ATM hardware business — Voyix now operates as a pure-play commerce technology platform serving restaurant, retail, and digital banking verticals. For Software Engineers, this means you are entering a company that has shed its hardware skin and is investing aggressively in cloud-native microservices architecture. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch in January 2026 marked the public debut of Voyix's next-generation commerce platform, and the engineering teams in Atlanta are staffing up to sustain that momentum across all three verticals.

The strategic lever here is that Voyix is not merely maintaining legacy POS systems — it is rebuilding the entire commerce stack from scratch on modern cloud-native principles. The Voyix Insight Conversational AI product represents the company's forward-looking bet on AI-powered commerce, and every engineer contributes to the Modernization Inflection thesis that separates Voyix from legacy competitors like Oracle Hospitality or Toshiba Commerce. At $3.5B+ in revenue, Voyix comp will not match Google or Meta, but it is competitive within the Atlanta market and offers meaningful RSU upside as the transformation story plays out on NYSE: VYX.

Software Engineers at Voyix work across the full stack of the commerce platform — from API gateway layers and event-driven microservices to frontend POS applications and Voyix Insight integrations. The Atlanta hub is the center of gravity for engineering, and the company values engineers who can operate across the legacy-to-cloud migration boundary. This hybrid skill set — understanding both the monolithic systems being deprecated and the microservices replacing them — is your negotiation edge.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — NRF 2026 Microservices Velocity:** "The NRF 2026 Microservices launch signals that Voyix is entering a high-velocity build phase. I want to ensure my compensation reflects the intensity and strategic importance of this moment — engineers joining now are building the foundational services that will define the platform for the next decade. I'd like to see the base adjusted to $130,000 to reflect the pace of delivery expected."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight AI Integration:** "Voyix Insight is the company's most visible AI product, and as a Software Engineer I'll be contributing to the APIs and service layers that power Conversational AI for commerce. Given the market premium on engineers with AI-adjacent platform skills, I believe an RSU grant of $45,000 over four years better reflects the long-term value I'll help create for VYX shareholders."

**Lever 3 — Atlanta Hub Cost-Competitiveness Reframe:** "I appreciate that Atlanta offers a cost-of-living advantage over the Bay Area, but the talent market here has shifted considerably. Companies like Block, Salesforce, and Mailchimp have established significant Atlanta engineering presences. My competing offer from a fintech in the Atlanta market is $15,000 higher on base — I'd like to close that gap while staying with Voyix."

**Lever 4 — Modernization Inflection Scarcity:** "The Modernization Inflection strategy requires engineers who can bridge legacy POS architectures and cloud-native microservices. That dual fluency is genuinely scarce in the market. I have direct experience migrating monolithic systems to distributed architectures, which positions me to contribute immediately to the platform modernization. I'd like the offer to reflect that scarcity premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open by requesting a $15,000-$20,000 increase on base salary, anchoring to the NRF 2026 build velocity and Modernization Inflection scarcity. If base is rigid, pivot to requesting an additional $15,000 in RSU grant (from ~$30,000 to $45,000 over 4 years), framing the ask around Voyix Insight's long-term value to VYX stock price. Use a competing Atlanta fintech offer as social proof. Accept-at floor: $120,000 base / $30,000 RSU in Atlanta; $140,000 base / $40,000 RSU in New York. Always frame concessions as investments in the Modernization Inflection thesis — you are not asking for more money, you are aligning your comp with the strategic premium Voyix places on this transformation.
