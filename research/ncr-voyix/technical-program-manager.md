**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at NCR Voyix are orchestrating the most complex cross-functional programs in the company's history. The Modernization Inflection is not a single project — it is a constellation of interconnected workstreams spanning three verticals (restaurant, retail, digital banking), multiple engineering teams, product organizations, solutions architecture, and merchant success. TPMs are the connective tissue that keeps these workstreams aligned and moving toward the same milestones. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch was a TPM-coordinated milestone — aligning engineering delivery, product readiness, solutions architecture, marketing, and sales enablement for a public platform debut at the industry's largest conference.

The Atleos spin-off simplified the TPM mission by eliminating the ATM hardware portfolio, but it also raised expectations — with a pure-play commerce focus, the programs TPMs manage are more visible to leadership and investors. Voyix Insight adds another program dimension: coordinating AI/ML engineering, data science, product design, and commerce platform teams to deliver an integrated Conversational AI product. TPMs who can manage programs at this level of cross-functional complexity — with technical depth sufficient to identify risks and dependencies that non-technical PMs would miss — are in significant demand.

The Atlanta hub is where most TPMs are based, sitting close to the engineering and product leadership teams. Comp for TPMs at Voyix is competitive within the Atlanta market, though the role's strategic importance often justifies negotiation above initial offers. The RSU component is meaningful — TPMs who successfully deliver the Modernization Inflection programs are directly responsible for the milestone achievements that drive VYX stock performance.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — NRF 2026 Program Complexity:** "The NRF 2026 Microservices launch required coordinating engineering, product, design, solutions architecture, and go-to-market teams across a high-stakes public milestone. The programs ahead are even more complex — scaling the platform across three verticals while maintaining delivery velocity. I'd like the base adjusted to $175,000 to reflect the scope and complexity of the programs I'll manage."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight Cross-Functional Orchestration:** "Voyix Insight spans AI/ML engineering, data science, product, design, and platform engineering. Coordinating these teams to deliver an integrated Conversational AI product requires a TPM who understands both AI development workflows and commerce platform constraints. My experience managing AI product programs at [company] directly applies. I'm requesting an RSU grant of $75,000 over four years to align with the multi-year Voyix Insight delivery roadmap."

**Lever 3 — Modernization Inflection Milestone Delivery:** "The Modernization Inflection thesis depends on hitting visible milestones — merchant migration targets, platform capability releases, vertical-specific feature launches. As a TPM, I own the delivery cadence for these milestones. My track record includes [X] on-time platform milestone deliveries at [company]. I'd like a $15,000 signing bonus to reflect the immediate impact of bringing structured program execution to the Voyix transformation."

**Lever 4 — Atlanta TPM Market Calibration:** "Technical Program Managers with cloud-native platform transformation experience command $160,000-$185,000 base in the Atlanta market. My competing offer from an Atlanta-based enterprise SaaS company is at $178,000 base. I'm drawn to the scale and strategic importance of the Voyix Modernization Inflection, but the comp needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with a $15,000-$25,000 base increase, anchored to NRF 2026 program complexity and Modernization Inflection milestone delivery ownership. TPMs should quantify their past impact in terms of program outcomes (e.g., "managed a platform migration program with 12 engineering teams, delivering 8 milestones on time across 18 months"). If base is constrained, push for $60,000-$80,000 in RSU over four years and a $15,000 signing bonus. Request that the offer include explicit scope definition — the programs a TPM manages should be documented, as scope creep without comp adjustment is common. Accept-at floor: $155,000 base / $50,000 RSU in Atlanta; $180,000 base / $65,000 RSU in New York. Frame through the Voyix Insight and Modernization Inflection lens — TPMs are the execution engine that translates transformation strategy into delivered milestones.
