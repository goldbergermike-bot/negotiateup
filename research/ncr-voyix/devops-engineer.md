**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at NCR Voyix are building and operating the infrastructure layer that makes the Modernization Inflection possible. The migration from legacy on-premise POS deployments to cloud-native microservices is not just an application architecture change — it is a fundamental shift in how the platform is deployed, monitored, scaled, and operated across tens of thousands of merchant locations. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch demonstrated the platform's capabilities; DevOps engineers now must ensure that these microservices operate at enterprise reliability levels (99.95%+ uptime) while supporting the velocity of continuous deployment that cloud-native architecture enables.

The Atleos spin-off clarified the DevOps mission: all infrastructure investment goes toward the commerce platform. DevOps engineers at Voyix work with Kubernetes orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, observability stacks (metrics, logging, tracing), infrastructure-as-code, and multi-cloud deployment strategies. The Voyix Insight Conversational AI product adds complexity — AI inference workloads have different scaling characteristics than transactional commerce workloads, and DevOps engineers who can operate both efficiently are in high demand.

The Atlanta hub is the operational center for Voyix infrastructure, and DevOps engineers here support a global merchant base. The role carries on-call responsibilities and requires experience with production systems at scale. Comp is competitive for the Atlanta market, and the RSU component offers upside tied to the cloud-native transformation's success. DevOps engineers who bring experience migrating legacy infrastructure to cloud-native architectures — the exact Modernization Inflection infrastructure challenge — hold the strongest negotiation position.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — NRF 2026 Production Reliability:** "The NRF 2026 Microservices launch was a demo — running these services in production at enterprise scale across thousands of merchant locations is the real challenge. I'll be building the CI/CD pipelines, observability infrastructure, and deployment automation that makes the cloud-native platform reliable at scale. I'd like the base adjusted to $155,000 to reflect the production criticality of this role."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight Infrastructure Complexity:** "Voyix Insight's Conversational AI workloads require different infrastructure patterns than transactional commerce services — GPU scheduling, model serving, real-time inference pipelines. My experience operating ML infrastructure in production means I can build the DevOps foundation for Voyix Insight without the learning curve. I'm requesting an RSU grant of $60,000 over four years to reflect this specialized capability."

**Lever 3 — Modernization Inflection Infrastructure Migration:** "The Modernization Inflection requires migrating thousands of merchant deployments from legacy on-premise infrastructure to cloud-native architectures. I've led infrastructure migrations of comparable scale at [company], transitioning [X] workloads to Kubernetes with zero unplanned downtime. This migration expertise is directly applicable to the Voyix transformation, and I'd like a $12,000 signing bonus to reflect the immediate productivity it enables."

**Lever 4 — On-Call and Operational Premium:** "This role carries production on-call responsibilities for a commerce platform processing real-time transactions. The operational burden and expertise required to maintain 99.95%+ uptime across a distributed microservices architecture justifies compensation at the upper end of the band. I'm asking for total first-year comp of $210,000 in Atlanta."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with a $15,000-$20,000 base increase, anchored to NRF 2026 production reliability requirements and Modernization Inflection infrastructure migration expertise. DevOps engineers should emphasize the production criticality of their role — commerce platform downtime directly impacts merchant revenue and VYX reputation. If base is constrained, push for $50,000-$65,000 in RSU over four years and a $12,000 signing bonus. Request clarity on on-call compensation structure and ensure it is documented in the offer letter. Accept-at floor: $140,000 base / $35,000 RSU in Atlanta; $160,000 base / $50,000 RSU in New York. Frame every ask through the Modernization Inflection infrastructure lens — you are building the reliability foundation that makes the cloud-native commerce platform trustworthy for enterprise merchants.
