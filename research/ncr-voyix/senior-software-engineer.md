**Negotiation DNA**

The Senior Software Engineer is the workhorse of NCR Voyix's Modernization Inflection strategy. This is the level where engineers own entire microservice domains — designing, building, and operating the cloud-native commerce services that replace legacy POS monoliths across restaurant, retail, and digital banking verticals. With the NRF 2026 Microservices launch behind them, Voyix needs senior engineers who can sustain delivery velocity while maintaining architectural integrity across a platform serving thousands of enterprise merchants. The Atleos spin-off has sharpened the company's focus: every engineering dollar now goes toward the commerce platform, and senior engineers are the multipliers who make that investment pay off.

At this level, you are expected to influence technical direction, mentor junior engineers, and drive the adoption of cloud-native patterns — event-driven architectures, containerized deployments, API-first design — across your domain. The Voyix Insight Conversational AI product is a particularly high-leverage area: senior engineers working on the AI inference pipeline, natural language processing integrations, or the commerce data layer that feeds Voyix Insight are in exceptional demand. The Atlanta hub is the primary engineering center, and Voyix competes directly with Block, Salesforce, Mailchimp (Intuit), and a growing cohort of Atlanta-based fintechs for this talent.

Your negotiation position is strongest when you can demonstrate experience migrating legacy systems to modern architectures — the exact Modernization Inflection skill set that Voyix needs at scale. The company's $3.5B+ revenue base means it can afford competitive compensation, and the RSU component is particularly interesting at current VYX valuations given the post-spin-off re-rating thesis. Senior engineers who can articulate their impact on the cloud-native commerce transformation have significant room to negotiate above initial offers.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — NRF 2026 Platform Sustaining Velocity:** "The NRF 2026 Microservices launch was the opening act — sustaining delivery velocity across three verticals (restaurant, retail, digital banking) is the harder problem. As a senior engineer, I'll own critical service domains that directly impact merchant adoption. I'd like to see the base moved to $170,000 to reflect the ownership scope and delivery expectations at this stage of the platform build."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight Architecture Ownership:** "Voyix Insight is the company's headline AI product, and the senior engineers designing the service mesh, data pipelines, and API contracts around it are directly shaping its commercial success. My experience building production AI-serving infrastructure makes me a strong fit for this work, and I believe an RSU grant of $90,000 over four years better aligns my incentives with the Voyix Insight roadmap and VYX stock performance."

**Lever 3 — Modernization Inflection Expertise Premium:** "The Modernization Inflection strategy specifically targets the migration from legacy POS architectures to cloud-native microservices. I've led three similar migrations at scale in my career. This isn't a common skill set — most senior engineers have only worked on greenfield cloud-native systems or legacy maintenance, not the bridge between them. I'd like the offer to include a $15,000 signing bonus to recognize the immediate productivity this experience enables."

**Lever 4 — Atlanta Market Recalibration:** "I want to be transparent — I have a competing offer from a Series D fintech in Atlanta at $180,000 base. I prefer the Voyix mission and the scale of the Modernization Inflection challenge, but I need the comp to be within range. Can we close the gap on base, or alternatively increase the RSU component to reflect the long-term upside I'd be choosing by joining Voyix?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Lead with a $20,000-$30,000 base increase request, anchored to Modernization Inflection expertise and NRF 2026 delivery velocity expectations. The strongest lever at this level is the scarcity of engineers who have led legacy-to-cloud migrations at enterprise scale — quantify your past impact (e.g., "migrated 200+ merchants from monolithic POS to microservices with 99.9% uptime"). If base is capped by band, request an additional $20,000-$30,000 in RSU (targeting $80,000-$100,000 total grant) and a $15,000 signing bonus. Accept-at floor: $155,000 base / $60,000 RSU in Atlanta; $180,000 base / $80,000 RSU in New York. Frame every ask through the Voyix Insight and Modernization Inflection lens — the company's investor narrative depends on executing this transformation, and you are the execution layer.
