**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at NCR Voyix sit at the intersection of the company's two most important strategic assets: the massive commerce transaction dataset generated by tens of thousands of merchant locations, and the Voyix Insight Conversational AI platform that transforms that data into actionable intelligence. With the Atleos spin-off complete, Voyix's data science team is focused exclusively on the commerce platform — analyzing transaction patterns, predicting merchant behavior, optimizing pricing models, and building the analytical models that power Voyix Insight. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch demonstrated the cloud-native platform's data capabilities, and data scientists are now critical to proving that the platform generates insights legacy POS systems never could.

The Modernization Inflection thesis has a direct data science dimension: the cloud-native platform captures richer, more granular data than legacy POS systems, and data scientists who can surface insights from that data create the value proposition that convinces merchants to migrate. Every merchant who sees a Voyix Insight dashboard showing them patterns they couldn't see before becomes an advocate for migration. Data scientists who can build models across restaurant, retail, and digital banking verticals — understanding the distinct economics of each — are particularly valuable.

The Atlanta hub is the center of data science operations, and the team collaborates closely with the Voyix Insight product and engineering organizations. Comp for data scientists at Voyix is competitive within the Atlanta market, though below FAANG levels. The RSU component offers meaningful upside — if the Modernization Inflection drives VYX re-rating, data scientists who contributed to Voyix Insight's commercial success will benefit directly. Your negotiation leverage is highest when you can demonstrate experience with large-scale commerce datasets, real-time analytics pipelines, and AI/ML models deployed in production commerce environments.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — NRF 2026 Data Platform Proof Point:** "The NRF 2026 Microservices launch proved that the cloud-native platform can capture and process commerce data at scale. The next phase is proving that data generates actionable insights — that's my job. I'd like the base adjusted to $165,000 to reflect the strategic importance of data science to the Modernization Inflection thesis."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight Model Development:** "Voyix Insight is only as good as the models behind it. I'll be building the analytical models that power Conversational AI for commerce — demand forecasting, customer segmentation, anomaly detection, pricing optimization. My experience deploying ML models in production commerce environments at [company] directly translates. I'm requesting an RSU grant of $70,000 over four years to align with Voyix Insight's long-term value trajectory."

**Lever 3 — Commerce Data Scarcity Premium:** "Data scientists who understand commerce transaction data at scale — across restaurant, retail, and banking verticals — are genuinely scarce. Most DS talent is concentrated in ad-tech or consumer social. My domain expertise in commerce analytics represents a scarcity premium that the initial offer doesn't reflect. I'd like a $12,000 signing bonus and a commitment to a comp review at the 12-month mark."

**Lever 4 — Modernization Inflection Data Narrative:** "The Modernization Inflection story that Voyix tells investors depends on demonstrating that the cloud-native platform generates superior data insights compared to legacy POS systems. Data scientists create the evidence for that narrative. I'm asking for total first-year comp of $230,000 in Atlanta to reflect the strategic role data science plays in the company's valuation story."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with a $15,000-$20,000 base increase, anchored to the Voyix Insight model development opportunity and commerce data scarcity premium. Data scientists should quantify their past impact on commercial metrics (e.g., "my demand forecasting model reduced food waste by 12% across 500 restaurant locations"). If base is constrained, push for $60,000-$75,000 in RSU over four years, framing it through the Voyix Insight product roadmap. A $12,000 signing bonus is reasonable. Accept-at floor: $145,000 base / $45,000 RSU in Atlanta; $170,000 base / $60,000 RSU in New York. Always connect your ask to the Modernization Inflection data narrative — you are not just analyzing data, you are building the evidence that the cloud-native platform delivers more merchant value than legacy systems.
