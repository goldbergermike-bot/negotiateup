**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at NCR Voyix are designing the interfaces and experiences that merchants interact with every day — POS screens, kitchen display systems, self-checkout flows, back-office dashboards, and the Voyix Insight Conversational AI interface. This is not abstract consumer app design; it is operational design for commerce environments where milliseconds of interaction time translate to revenue impact for merchants serving millions of end consumers. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch showcased the new cloud-native platform's capabilities, and the design team is now responsible for ensuring that the migration from legacy POS interfaces to the modern platform feels seamless and immediately valuable to merchants.

The Modernization Inflection strategy creates a unique design challenge: merchants are accustomed to legacy POS interfaces they have used for years, and the cloud-native platform must feel simultaneously familiar and superior. This requires designers who understand commerce operations deeply — how a restaurant server uses a POS during a dinner rush, how a retail cashier processes returns, how a bank teller navigates transaction flows. The Voyix Insight Conversational AI adds another dimension: designing natural language interfaces for merchant analytics and operations represents a frontier design challenge that blends conversational UX with commerce domain expertise.

The Atlanta hub is the primary location for the design team, and Voyix offers Product Designers the opportunity to work at a scale that few commerce companies can match — $3.5B+ in revenue, tens of thousands of merchant locations, and three distinct verticals each with unique design challenges. The RSU component, while modest relative to FAANG design roles, represents meaningful upside if the Modernization Inflection thesis drives VYX re-rating. Designers who can articulate their impact on merchant adoption and migration success have room to negotiate meaningfully above initial offers.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — NRF 2026 Design Showcase Impact:** "The NRF 2026 Microservices launch put the new commerce platform in front of the entire industry. The design of that platform — the merchant-facing interfaces, the onboarding flows, the operational dashboards — is what drives adoption. I'd like the base adjusted to $140,000 to reflect the direct relationship between design quality and merchant migration success."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight Conversational UX:** "Designing the Conversational AI interface for Voyix Insight is one of the most challenging design problems in commerce technology. Merchants need to query their business data through natural language in high-pressure operational environments. My experience designing conversational interfaces and commerce operational tools directly addresses this challenge. I'm requesting an RSU grant of $50,000 over four years to align with the long-term value Voyix Insight creates."

**Lever 3 — Modernization Inflection Design Bridge:** "The Modernization Inflection depends on merchants willingly migrating from legacy POS interfaces they've used for years to a new cloud-native platform. That migration is fundamentally a design problem — the new experience must feel immediately superior. I've led design for similar platform migrations affecting [X] thousand users, and I know how to reduce migration friction. A $10,000 signing bonus reflects the immediate impact this experience enables."

**Lever 4 — Atlanta Design Market Premium:** "The Atlanta design talent market has grown significantly with the expansion of tech companies in the area. My competing offer from a commerce-adjacent SaaS company is $15,000 higher on base. I'm drawn to the complexity and scale of the Voyix platform, but I need the comp to be competitive. Can we close the gap on base or increase the RSU component?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with a $15,000-$20,000 base increase, framing it as a Modernization Inflection design migration premium. Designers should emphasize their direct impact on merchant adoption rates — if the new platform's UX is poor, merchants resist migration and the entire Modernization Inflection thesis stalls. If base is constrained, request $40,000-$55,000 in RSU (up from ~$30,000 midpoint) and a $10,000 signing bonus. For Voyix Insight-focused design roles, push harder on RSU given the product's strategic importance. Accept-at floor: $125,000 base / $30,000 RSU in Atlanta; $145,000 base / $40,000 RSU in New York. Frame the negotiation through the Voyix Insight Conversational AI design opportunity — you are designing the interface between merchants and AI-powered commerce intelligence.
