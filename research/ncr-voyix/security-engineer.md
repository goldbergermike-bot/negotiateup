**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at NCR Voyix protect a commerce platform that processes billions of dollars in transactions annually across restaurant, retail, and digital banking verticals. This is not abstract security work — a breach at Voyix could compromise merchant financial data, consumer payment information, and banking transactions at scale. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch introduced a fundamentally new attack surface: cloud-native microservices, API gateways, service meshes, and container orchestration all create security challenges that did not exist in the legacy monolithic POS architecture. Security engineers who understand both the legacy threat model and the cloud-native security landscape are essential to the Modernization Inflection.

The Atleos spin-off focused Voyix's security organization exclusively on commerce platform security, but it also concentrated risk. Every security incident now impacts the pure-play commerce business directly — there is no ATM hardware revenue to buffer the financial and reputational impact. PCI-DSS compliance is table stakes, but the real security challenge is securing a cloud-native platform that operates across multiple deployment models (cloud, edge, hybrid) while maintaining the transaction throughput that merchants demand. Voyix Insight's Conversational AI adds data security complexity — AI models that process merchant business data must be secured against data leakage, prompt injection, and model manipulation.

The Atlanta hub houses the core security engineering team, and Security Engineers here work across application security, infrastructure security, compliance automation, and incident response. Comp is strong for the Atlanta market — security engineering talent commands a premium universally, and the commerce domain adds a compliance specialization premium (PCI-DSS, SOC 2, GDPR for international deployments). Your negotiation leverage is highest when you combine cloud-native security expertise with commerce compliance experience.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — NRF 2026 Cloud-Native Security Surface:** "The NRF 2026 Microservices launch introduced a fundamentally new security surface — API gateways, service meshes, container orchestration, multi-tenant data isolation. Securing this architecture requires a different skill set than legacy POS security. I bring direct experience securing cloud-native microservices platforms at scale, and I'd like the base adjusted to $170,000 to reflect this specialized capability."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight AI Security:** "Voyix Insight's Conversational AI introduces novel security challenges — data leakage risks, prompt injection vulnerabilities, model access controls, and PII handling in AI inference pipelines. AI security is an emerging specialization and my experience securing ML systems in production gives me a direct advantage. I'm requesting an RSU grant of $70,000 over four years to align with the long-term importance of AI security to the Voyix Insight product."

**Lever 3 — Modernization Inflection Compliance Continuity:** "The Modernization Inflection requires maintaining PCI-DSS compliance throughout the migration from legacy to cloud-native systems — merchants cannot experience a compliance gap during the transition. I've managed security compliance through similar platform migrations at [company], ensuring zero compliance incidents during the transition. I'd like a $15,000 signing bonus to reflect the compliance continuity expertise I bring."

**Lever 4 — Commerce Security Scarcity:** "Security engineers with both cloud-native security expertise and PCI-DSS commerce compliance experience are scarce — most security talent specializes in one domain or the other. I offer both, plus experience with the specific threat models that apply to commerce platforms. My competing offer from a payments company is $20,000 higher on base. I prefer the Voyix platform challenge, but the comp needs to reflect the market value of this dual specialization."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with a $15,000-$25,000 base increase, anchored to the NRF 2026 cloud-native security surface expansion and commerce security scarcity. Security engineers should emphasize the asymmetric risk profile — the cost of a security incident at Voyix (regulatory fines, merchant trust, VYX stock impact) vastly exceeds the incremental cost of competitive security engineering compensation. If base is constrained, push for $60,000-$75,000 in RSU over four years and a $15,000 signing bonus. Request clarity on incident response on-call expectations and ensure they are reflected in the offer. Accept-at floor: $150,000 base / $45,000 RSU in Atlanta; $175,000 base / $60,000 RSU in New York. Frame through the Modernization Inflection compliance lens — you are the engineer who ensures the cloud-native migration does not compromise the security posture that merchants and regulators require.
