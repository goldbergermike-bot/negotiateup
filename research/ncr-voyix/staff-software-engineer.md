**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at NCR Voyix sit at the architectural apex of the Modernization Inflection strategy. This is the level where individual contributors define the technical direction of entire platform domains — the microservices topology, the event-driven architecture patterns, the API contracts that bind restaurant, retail, and digital banking verticals into a unified commerce platform. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch validated the architectural direction; now the company needs staff-level engineers to scale that architecture across thousands of enterprise deployments while maintaining the velocity that investors expect from the post-Atleos pure-play commerce story.

At the staff level, your negotiation leverage is fundamentally different from senior engineers. You are not just executing on a technical vision — you are setting the vision. The Voyix Insight Conversational AI product, the cloud-native commerce platform, the data infrastructure that powers merchant analytics — all of these depend on architectural decisions made at the staff level. Voyix competes for this talent not just with Atlanta peers but with FAANG companies offering remote roles, and the comp bands must reflect that reality. The RSU component becomes particularly significant at this level, as staff engineers are expected to stay for multiple vesting cycles and their architectural decisions compound in value over time.

The Atleos spin-off has created a unique moment for staff-level hires. With the ATM business separated, the entire engineering leadership is focused on the commerce platform transformation. Staff engineers joining now will shape the architecture of a $3.5B+ revenue platform during its most formative period. This is the "Modernization Inflection" in practice — the inflection point where legacy POS revenue transitions to cloud-native recurring revenue, and the architects of that transition hold extraordinary leverage.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — Architecture Authority Premium:** "At the staff level, I'm not joining to write code within an existing architecture — I'm joining to define the architecture. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch established the initial platform direction, and the next phase requires staff engineers who can scale that architecture across all three verticals. I'd like the base adjusted to $220,000 to reflect the scope of architectural authority this role carries."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight Platform Architecture:** "Voyix Insight is the most architecturally complex product in the portfolio — it requires real-time commerce data pipelines, low-latency AI inference, and conversational interfaces that integrate with merchant POS workflows. As a staff engineer, I would own the architectural blueprint for how Insight scales. Given the strategic importance, I'm requesting an RSU grant of $160,000 over four years to align my compensation with the long-term value Voyix Insight creates for VYX."

**Lever 3 — Modernization Inflection Architect Scarcity:** "NCR Voyix has publicly committed to the Modernization Inflection thesis — transforming legacy POS revenue into cloud-native recurring revenue. The architects who execute that transformation are the scarcest hire in enterprise commerce technology. I've led analogous platform modernizations at [company] serving [X] million transactions daily. I'd like a $25,000 signing bonus and accelerated first-year RSU vesting to reflect the immediate impact I'll have on the modernization timeline."

**Lever 4 — Atlanta Hub Leadership Multiplier:** "The Atlanta hub is the center of gravity for Voyix engineering, and staff engineers set the technical culture for the entire organization. I'll be mentoring senior engineers, conducting architecture reviews, and representing engineering in cross-functional planning. This leadership multiplier effect justifies compensation in the top quartile of the band — I'm asking for total first-year comp of $350,000+ in Atlanta."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** At the staff level, negotiate on total compensation rather than individual components. Open with a target of $350,000-$400,000 total comp in Atlanta ($400,000-$450,000 in New York), citing the architectural authority and Modernization Inflection scarcity premium. The strongest lever is RSU: request $140,000-$160,000 over four years, emphasizing that staff engineers' architectural decisions directly impact VYX stock performance via the cloud-native revenue transition. Request a $25,000 signing bonus and accelerated Year 1 vesting (40% front-loaded instead of 25%). Accept-at floor: $195,000 base / $100,000 RSU / $25,000 signing in Atlanta; $220,000 base / $130,000 RSU / $30,000 signing in New York. Frame the entire negotiation through the Voyix Insight architecture ownership lens — you are not a cost center, you are the architect of the Modernization Inflection.
