**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at NCR Voyix are building the intelligence layer of the commerce platform — and the centerpiece of that work is Voyix Insight, the company's Conversational AI product. This is not research or experimentation; it is production AI engineering for a commerce platform serving tens of thousands of merchant locations across restaurant, retail, and digital banking verticals. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch established the cloud-native platform architecture, and ML/AI engineers are now building the models, inference pipelines, and AI services that differentiate Voyix from every legacy POS competitor in the market.

Voyix Insight's Conversational AI enables merchants to query their business data through natural language — asking questions about sales trends, labor optimization, inventory levels, and customer behavior without navigating complex dashboards. Building this requires expertise across natural language processing, retrieval-augmented generation, real-time inference, and commerce domain modeling. ML/AI engineers who can build production-grade AI systems that operate within the latency and reliability constraints of a commerce platform are exceptionally valuable. The Modernization Inflection thesis positions Voyix Insight as the premium feature that justifies cloud-native migration — merchants move from legacy POS to the new platform specifically because of AI-powered capabilities that legacy systems cannot match.

The Atlanta hub is building out its AI/ML team, and Voyix competes for this talent with both local employers (Block, Salesforce, fintech startups) and remote-first AI companies. Comp for ML/AI engineers carries a premium over general software engineering, reflecting the scarcity of production AI expertise in the market. The RSU component is particularly interesting — if Voyix Insight drives merchant adoption and revenue growth as the company projects, ML/AI engineers will have been the builders of the highest-leverage product in the portfolio.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — Voyix Insight Core Builder Premium:** "Voyix Insight is the company's headline AI product — the feature that differentiates the cloud-native platform from every legacy POS competitor. As an ML/AI engineer, I'm building the core models and inference pipelines that make Voyix Insight work. I'd like the base adjusted to $190,000 to reflect the strategic centrality of this work to Voyix's product differentiation and investor narrative."

**Lever 2 — NRF 2026 AI Commerce Platform:** "The NRF 2026 Microservices launch introduced the cloud-native platform, and Voyix Insight is the AI layer that makes that platform intelligent. Building production-grade Conversational AI for commerce — with real-time inference, retrieval-augmented generation, and merchant-specific context — requires specialized ML engineering expertise. My experience shipping production AI systems at [company] directly applies, and I'm requesting an RSU grant of $95,000 over four years to align with Voyix Insight's multi-year product trajectory."

**Lever 3 — Modernization Inflection AI Differentiation:** "The Modernization Inflection thesis depends on convincing merchants that the cloud-native platform delivers capabilities legacy systems cannot match. Voyix Insight's Conversational AI is the primary proof point. I'm building the capability that justifies migration. I'd like a $20,000 signing bonus to offset the opportunity cost of joining Voyix over a pure-play AI company — I'm choosing Voyix because the commerce application domain is compelling, and I need the comp to reflect that the AI work here is first-class."

**Lever 4 — Production AI Scarcity in Commerce:** "ML/AI engineers who can build production AI systems within the constraints of a commerce platform — sub-200ms inference latency, 99.9%+ uptime, PCI-compliant data handling — are scarce. Most AI talent is concentrated in consumer tech or pure research. I bring production AI experience and a willingness to apply it to the commerce domain. My competing offer from a Series C AI startup is $25,000 higher on base with more equity. I need Voyix to close that gap."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with a $20,000-$30,000 base increase, anchored to the Voyix Insight core builder premium and production AI scarcity in commerce. ML/AI engineers have maximum leverage when they can demonstrate production AI systems they have shipped — quantify inference latency, model accuracy, throughput, and business impact. If base is constrained, push for $80,000-$100,000 in RSU over four years (framing it as alignment with the Voyix Insight product roadmap) and a $20,000 signing bonus. ML/AI engineers should also negotiate for compute budget and conference attendance as non-comp benefits. Accept-at floor: $165,000 base / $60,000 RSU in Atlanta; $190,000 base / $80,000 RSU in New York. Frame every ask through the Voyix Insight and Modernization Inflection lens — you are building the AI capability that makes the entire platform transformation worthwhile.
