**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at NCR Voyix are leading teams through the most significant technical transformation in the company's history. The Atleos spin-off clarified the mission — Voyix is now a pure-play commerce technology platform — and engineering managers are responsible for staffing, retaining, and directing the teams that execute the Modernization Inflection strategy. This is not incremental feature development; it is a wholesale migration from legacy POS monoliths to cloud-native microservices architecture across restaurant, retail, and digital banking verticals. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch demonstrated the platform's viability, and now engineering managers must scale their teams to deliver against an aggressive roadmap.

The Atlanta hub is where the majority of Voyix engineering sits, and EMs here face a competitive talent market. Block, Salesforce, Intuit (Mailchimp), and a growing set of Atlanta fintechs are all competing for the same engineering talent. An EM's ability to recruit and retain in this market directly impacts Voyix's ability to execute the Modernization Inflection. The Voyix Insight Conversational AI product adds another dimension — EMs leading Insight-adjacent teams need to build AI/ML capabilities while maintaining delivery velocity on the core commerce platform.

Your negotiation leverage as an EM is tied to your ability to scale engineering organizations during platform transformations. If you have managed teams through legacy-to-cloud migrations, built cloud-native engineering cultures, or scaled teams from 5 to 20+ engineers while maintaining delivery quality, you hold exactly the experience Voyix needs. The RSU component is meaningful here — EMs who successfully execute the Modernization Inflection will be managing teams that directly drive VYX revenue growth, and the stock should reflect that upside.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — Transformation Team Leadership:** "Managing engineering teams during a platform transformation is fundamentally different from managing steady-state feature teams. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch was the beginning — I'll be leading a team through the hardest phase: scaling cloud-native services to production quality across thousands of merchants. I'd like the base adjusted to $205,000 to reflect the transformation leadership premium this role demands."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight Talent Strategy:** "Building the team around Voyix Insight requires recruiting AI/ML engineers into a commerce technology company — that's a non-trivial talent challenge. My track record of building AI-capable engineering teams in enterprise contexts directly addresses this gap. I'm requesting an RSU grant of $130,000 over four years, reflecting the long-term impact of the team I'll build on Voyix Insight's market success."

**Lever 3 — Atlanta Hub Retention Economics:** "Engineering manager compensation directly impacts team retention — my team will benchmark my comp against market data, and if I'm undercompensated, it signals that Voyix undervalues its engineering leadership. In the current Atlanta market, EM comp at competitive employers ranges $180,000-$220,000 base. I need to be positioned credibly within that range to effectively recruit and retain the talent the Modernization Inflection requires."

**Lever 4 — Modernization Inflection Execution Risk:** "The Modernization Inflection thesis is the centerpiece of Voyix's investor narrative. The execution risk sits squarely with engineering managers — we are the ones translating strategy into shipped software. I have managed three platform migrations at scale, each delivering on time and within quality targets. I'd like a $20,000 signing bonus to offset the opportunity cost of leaving my current role, where I'm managing a team through a similar transformation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Lead with a $20,000-$25,000 base increase, framing it as a Modernization Inflection transformation leadership premium. EMs have unique leverage because their compensation signals organizational investment in engineering leadership — an undercompensated EM undermines recruiting and retention for the entire team. If base is constrained, push for $100,000-$130,000 in RSU over four years and a $20,000 signing bonus. Request a commitment to a 6-month comp review tied to team growth and delivery milestones from the Voyix Insight roadmap. Accept-at floor: $185,000 base / $80,000 RSU in Atlanta; $210,000 base / $110,000 RSU in New York. Always frame through the Modernization Inflection lens: engineering managers are the execution layer between strategy and revenue.
