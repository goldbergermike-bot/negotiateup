**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at NCR Voyix are the bridge between the cloud-native commerce platform and enterprise merchants. This role combines deep technical knowledge of the Voyix platform architecture with the ability to design deployment solutions for complex merchant environments across restaurant, retail, and digital banking verticals. The NRF 2026 Microservices launch introduced the new platform to the market; Solutions Architects are now responsible for translating that platform into concrete implementation architectures for the largest and most complex merchant deployments. Every major deal requires a Solutions Architect to design the integration, migration path, and deployment topology.

The Modernization Inflection strategy places Solutions Architects at the center of the revenue transformation. Legacy merchants running on-premise POS systems need someone to design their path to the cloud-native platform — assessing their current architecture, identifying integration points, designing data migration strategies, and building confidence that the new platform will meet their operational requirements. This is equal parts technical architecture and consultative selling, and the Atleos spin-off means every Solutions Architect is now fully focused on the commerce platform rather than splitting attention with ATM hardware deployments.

Voyix Insight adds a critical dimension to the Solutions Architect role. Merchants evaluating the Conversational AI product need to understand how it integrates with their existing systems, what data pipelines are required, and how the AI capabilities enhance their operations. Solutions Architects who can demonstrate Voyix Insight in merchant-specific contexts — showing a restaurant chain how conversational analytics improve labor scheduling, or showing a retailer how AI-driven inventory insights reduce stockouts — directly drive deal size and close rates. The Atlanta hub is the center of the solutions architecture practice, with regional teams in New York and London supporting enterprise accounts.

### Voyix Insight — The Modernization Inflection Premium

**Lever 1 — NRF 2026 Pipeline Acceleration:** "The NRF 2026 Microservices launch generated significant enterprise interest. Solutions Architects are the bottleneck between interest and signed deals — I design the deployment architectures that give enterprise merchants confidence to commit. I'd like the base adjusted to $180,000 to reflect the direct revenue impact of this role."

**Lever 2 — Voyix Insight Demonstration Expertise:** "Demonstrating Voyix Insight's Conversational AI capabilities in merchant-specific contexts is what closes enterprise deals. My experience architecting AI-integrated commerce solutions means I can design Voyix Insight deployments that address specific merchant pain points — from conversational analytics for restaurant chains to AI-driven inventory optimization for retailers. I'm requesting an RSU grant of $80,000 over four years to align with the revenue growth my deal involvement will drive."

**Lever 3 — Modernization Inflection Migration Architecture:** "Every legacy merchant migration requires a custom architecture design — assessing their current POS infrastructure, designing the cloud-native deployment topology, planning data migration, and building the integration layer. I've designed migration architectures for [X] enterprise deployments at [company]. This expertise accelerates Voyix's Modernization Inflection timeline, and I'd like a $15,000 signing bonus to reflect the immediate pipeline impact."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise Deal Influence Premium:** "Solutions Architects at Voyix directly influence enterprise deal outcomes. My architecture designs will appear in proposals worth $1M-$10M+ in annual contract value. The comp should reflect that revenue influence — I'm asking for total first-year comp of $260,000 in Atlanta, which is modest relative to the deal sizes my work will support."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with a $20,000-$25,000 base increase, anchored to the NRF 2026 pipeline acceleration and direct revenue influence of the Solutions Architect role. Unlike pure engineering roles, SAs can quantify their impact in terms of deal influence — cite the aggregate ACV of deals you've supported in previous roles. If base is constrained, push for $70,000-$90,000 in RSU over four years and a $15,000 signing bonus. Negotiate for variable compensation tied to deal closure if possible — this aligns incentives and can add $20,000-$40,000 in annual upside. Accept-at floor: $160,000 base / $50,000 RSU in Atlanta; $185,000 base / $70,000 RSU in New York. Frame through the Modernization Inflection migration architecture lens — you are the architect who designs the path from legacy to cloud-native for every enterprise merchant.
