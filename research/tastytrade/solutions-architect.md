#### Negotiation DNA

The Solutions Architect role at Tastytrade sits at the critical intersection of derivatives domain expertise and enterprise-scale system design. You are not designing generic microservices architectures or standard API platforms — you are architecting solutions that handle real-time options pricing across tens of thousands of contracts, multi-leg order routing with atomic execution guarantees, portfolio-level Greeks computation at scale, and cross-asset integration between Tastytrade's options-native platform and IG Group's global FX/CFD infrastructure. Every architectural decision you make must account for the unique characteristics of derivatives markets: non-linear payoff structures, time-dependent pricing (theta), volatility surface dynamics, and the complex interplay of Greeks across multi-leg positions.

The IG Group acquisition has elevated the Solutions Architect role to strategic importance. You are now designing the integration architecture that connects two fundamentally different trading platforms — Tastytrade's options-native system built for active derivatives traders and IG Group's global multi-asset platform built for FX, CFD, and spread betting clients. The architectural decisions you make about data models, API contracts, event streaming patterns, and risk computation frameworks will determine whether this $1B integration succeeds technically.

Tom Sosnoff's vision for Tastytrade has always been about making options trading accessible through technology. As a Solutions Architect, you are the person who translates that vision into technical reality at enterprise scale — designing systems that can handle global trading volume while preserving the derivatives-native user experience that differentiates Tastytrade from every generic brokerage platform.

#### Options Alpha — The Derivatives-Native Premium

As a Solutions Architect at Tastytrade, the Derivatives-Native premium reflects your ability to design end-to-end technical solutions that account for the specialized requirements of derivatives trading — from market data ingestion to order execution to risk computation to client-facing analytics.

- **The Derivatives-Native Bonus (8-15% above standard fintech):** Solutions Architects with options/derivatives platform architecture expertise command a Derivatives-Native bonus of $16K-$42K above standard SA compensation at comparable fintech firms. This premium reflects your ability to design systems that model vol surfaces in real time, route complex multi-leg options orders across fragmented markets, compute portfolio Greeks at scale, and integrate multiple derivatives asset classes into a unified platform architecture. At the SA level, this typically manifests as a $14K-$24K base uplift and a $8K-$18K annual bonus uplift.

- **High-Probability Trading Focus:** Your architectural solutions must embody Tastytrade's high-probability trading philosophy. You design systems that compute probability of profit in real time for arbitrary options strategies, that surface implied volatility analytics across the entire options market, and that enable Greeks-based portfolio management at scale. Each of these capabilities requires architectural patterns specific to derivatives — event sourcing for real-time Greeks updates, CQRS for separating order execution from analytics computation, and specialized data models that capture the multi-dimensional nature of options pricing (strike, expiration, volatility, Greeks). Architects who design for these derivatives-native patterns command premium compensation.

- **IG Group Global Integration:** Solutions Architects are the primary designers of the Tastytrade-IG Group integration architecture. You define how Tastytrade's options pricing engine communicates with IG Group's FX/CFD pricing systems, how risk computation is aggregated across asset classes and regulatory jurisdictions, and how the unified platform presents a coherent experience to users who may trade options, FX, and CFDs within the same session. This cross-platform architectural challenge — spanning asset classes, regulatory regimes, and geographies — is extraordinarily complex and commands premium compensation.

- **tastylive Media Network Synergy:** Solutions Architects may design the technical architecture that connects Tastytrade's trading platform with the tastylive media network — defining data pipelines that feed real-time market analytics into live content production, APIs that enable content creators to interact with trading systems on air, and streaming infrastructure that delivers synchronized trading and media experiences to millions of viewers. This media-platform architecture convergence is unique to Tastytrade and adds an additional dimension to the SA role.

#### Global Levers

**1. The "Integration Architecture" Lever**
> "The Tastytrade-IG Group integration is fundamentally an architecture challenge — designing systems that unify options-native and multi-asset global platforms across different data models, regulatory frameworks, and latency requirements. I've designed integration architectures for [specific cross-platform financial systems] and I understand the derivatives-specific challenges: how options pricing models differ from FX/CFD pricing, how risk aggregation works across non-linear derivatives positions, and how regulatory requirements diverge between SEC/CFTC and FCA jurisdictions. I'd like my compensation to reflect the strategic value of this integration architecture expertise — specifically, a Derivatives-Native premium of $20K-$35K."

**2. The "Derivatives Platform Expertise" Lever**
> "Architecting for a derivatives trading platform requires patterns that most solutions architects have never encountered — real-time vol surface computation, atomic multi-leg order execution, Greeks-based risk streaming, and options chain data modeling. I bring deep experience with these patterns and can design solutions that account for the unique characteristics of derivatives markets. Competing offers from [CME/CBOE/IBKR] at $240K-$282K TC reflect the scarcity of architects with this derivatives-native expertise."

**3. The "Cross-Asset Architecture" Lever**
> "With IG Group's global platform now integrating with Tastytrade, the architectural challenge spans equity options, FX options, CFDs, and spread betting — each with different pricing models, risk characteristics, and regulatory requirements. I can design unified architectures that handle this cross-asset complexity while maintaining the performance characteristics each asset class demands. This cross-asset architectural capability is rare and should be reflected in a premium compensation package."

**4. The "Chicago Derivatives Architecture Market" Lever**
> "Chicago's concentration of derivatives exchanges and trading firms creates strong demand for solutions architects with derivatives platform expertise. I'm seeing SA comp packages of $235K-$285K at Chicago derivatives firms. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to be competitive at $255K-$282K TC, reflecting both the market rate and the Derivatives-Native premium for architects who understand options platform design."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Solutions Architects at Tastytrade are designing the technical foundation of the Tastytrade-IG Group integrated platform — a billion-dollar architectural challenge. In **Chicago**, target $255K-$282K TC by anchoring on CME Group and CBOE SA compensation and emphasizing your ability to design derivatives-native platform architectures. In **New York**, push for $280K-$311K TC by adding the geographic premium and any experience with institutional derivatives platform architecture. In **London**, negotiate dual-currency at £190K-£216K / $238K-$269K TC — IG Group HQ needs solutions architects who can bridge Tastytrade's Chicago-based options platform with IG's global infrastructure. The strongest lever is demonstrating specific experience designing systems for derivatives trading — vol surface computation, multi-leg order routing, Greeks streaming, options chain data modeling — that directly maps to Tastytrade's architectural challenges.
