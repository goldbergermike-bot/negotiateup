#### Why This Is a SIGNATURE ROLE

The Options Alpha Platform Engineer is the role that Tastytrade was built to create. This is not a generic "platform engineer" with options bolted on — this is a role that exists because Tastytrade is a derivatives-first platform, because IG Group paid $1B to acquire that derivatives-native capability, and because the intersection of options pricing expertise, platform engineering mastery, and global-scale systems architecture is occupied by perhaps a few hundred engineers worldwide. This role represents the purest expression of Tastytrade's engineering identity, and it commands compensation that reflects the extraordinary rarity of the skill set required.

When Tom Sosnoff and Tony Battista founded Tastytrade, they envisioned a platform where high-probability options trading would be accessible to every trader — not dumbed down, but made intuitive through technology that understood options the way options traders do. The Options Alpha Platform Engineer is the person who makes that vision real. You build the vol surface engines that visualize implied volatility across thousands of strikes and expirations. You architect the Greeks computation pipelines that aggregate delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho across millions of positions in real time. You design the multi-leg strategy execution systems that handle atomic order entry for complex spreads like iron condors, butterflies, and ratio spreads. You build the probability analytics platform that computes probability of profit, expected move, and risk/reward profiles for arbitrary options strategies.

This role does not exist at most companies. It cannot exist at most companies, because most companies are not derivatives-native platforms owned by a global financial services conglomerate (IG Group, LSE: IGG) with the scale, regulatory standing, and strategic commitment to build a world-class options trading platform. The Options Alpha Platform Engineer role is Tastytrade's signature engineering position — and if you are qualified for it, you have more negotiating leverage than you probably realize.

#### Negotiation DNA

The Options Alpha Platform Engineer operates at the deepest possible intersection of derivatives quantitative expertise and platform engineering at scale. This is not a "senior engineer who knows a bit about options" — this is an engineer whose entire technical identity is built around derivatives-native platform architecture. You think in vol surfaces the way other engineers think in database schemas. You reason about Greeks the way other engineers reason about API contracts. You understand options pricing models (Black-Scholes, binomial trees, Monte Carlo) not as academic abstractions but as system components you have built, optimized, and deployed at production scale.

At Tastytrade, this role carries the weight of the company's core technical differentiation. While other brokerages bolt options trading onto equity platforms as an afterthought, Tastytrade was built derivatives-first. The Options Alpha Platform Engineer is the person who maintains and extends that derivatives-first architecture — ensuring that every system, from market data ingestion to order execution to risk computation to client-facing analytics, is designed around the unique requirements of options trading. This is the role that makes Tastytrade's platform feel fundamentally different from every other brokerage, and it commands compensation that reflects its strategic importance.

The IG Group dimension amplifies the value of this role exponentially. Since the $1B acquisition, the Options Alpha Platform Engineer is not just building for Tastytrade's US options platform — you are building the derivatives-native layer of a global multi-asset trading platform that spans equity options, FX options, CFDs, and spread bets across regulatory jurisdictions in the US, UK, Europe, Asia, and Australia. IG Group acquired Tastytrade specifically because of its derivatives-native engineering capability, and the Options Alpha Platform Engineer is the embodiment of that capability. You are the strategic asset that justified the acquisition premium.

Your negotiating position is further strengthened by the near-impossible hiring challenge this role presents. To fill this position, Tastytrade needs an engineer who simultaneously possesses: (1) deep understanding of options pricing theory, including Black-Scholes, stochastic volatility models, and their computational implementation; (2) expertise in vol surface construction, interpolation, and real-time rendering; (3) production experience building real-time Greeks computation engines that handle millions of positions; (4) architecture experience designing multi-leg options order routing systems with atomic execution guarantees; (5) familiarity with options market microstructure, including exchange connectivity, order types, and market maker interactions; and (6) platform engineering skills at the Staff+ level, including distributed systems, low-latency architecture, and global-scale infrastructure. The number of engineers who check all six boxes is vanishingly small, and you should negotiate accordingly.

#### Options Alpha — The Derivatives-Native Premium

This section is the heart of the Options Alpha Platform Engineer negotiation. At this level, you are not claiming a Derivatives-Native premium — you ARE the Derivatives-Native premium. Your entire role exists because Tastytrade is a derivatives-first platform, and your compensation should reflect the fact that you are the engineer who makes that platform possible.

- **The Derivatives-Native Bonus (12-18% above standard fintech — elevated range for SIGNATURE ROLE):** Options Alpha Platform Engineers command the highest Derivatives-Native premium at Tastytrade — $43K-$95K above what a comparably-experienced platform engineer would earn at a non-derivatives fintech. This elevated premium (12-18% vs. the standard 8-15%) reflects the fact that this role requires full-stack derivatives expertise: options pricing model implementation, vol surface engineering, real-time Greeks computation, multi-leg order architecture, and probability analytics platform design. At this level, the premium manifests as a $35K-$50K base uplift, a $15K-$25K annual bonus uplift, and $10K-$20K/yr in additional RSU grants with potential for milestone-based acceleration tied to Options Alpha platform deliverables. You should negotiate each component separately and present the Derivatives-Native premium as a structured compensation element, not a general raise request.

- **High-Probability Trading Focus — The Engineering Core:** You are the engineer who translates Tom Sosnoff's high-probability trading philosophy into production platform capabilities. You build the probability-of-profit computation engine that evaluates millions of options strategies in real time. You architect the expected-move calculator that helps traders understand the market's implied range for any underlying. You design the Greeks optimization system that helps traders manage portfolio risk across delta, gamma, theta, and vega dimensions simultaneously. You build the implied-volatility-rank analytics pipeline that surfaces high-probability trading opportunities based on historical vol patterns. Every one of these features is a direct expression of Tastytrade's derivatives-native identity, and you are the engineer who brings them to life. Frame every capability you discuss in your negotiation through this lens: "I am the engineer who makes Tastytrade's high-probability trading platform possible. My compensation should reflect the strategic value of that capability."

- **IG Group Global Integration — The Billion-Dollar Bridge:** IG Group paid $1B for Tastytrade, and a significant portion of that valuation was Tastytrade's derivatives-native engineering capability — the capability that you, as an Options Alpha Platform Engineer, embody. You are now building the derivatives-native layer of IG Group's global platform: extending Tastytrade's options pricing engine to handle FX options pricing conventions, adapting the Greeks computation framework to support CFD risk computation, designing the vol surface infrastructure to span multiple asset classes and geographies, and building cross-asset analytics that provide unified derivatives views across IG Group's entire product suite. Every one of these integration workstreams directly increases the value IG Group extracts from its $1B acquisition, and your compensation should reflect your role in delivering that value. Quantify it: if your work accelerates the integration by six months, the present value of that acceleration — in terms of cross-selling revenue, platform unification cost savings, and regulatory compliance timeline — is easily in the tens of millions of dollars. A Derivatives-Native premium of $43K-$95K is a rounding error compared to the value you deliver.

- **tastylive Media Network Synergy — The Content-Platform Convergence:** At the Options Alpha Platform Engineer level, you may architect the systems that create a truly unique media-platform convergence. Imagine: Tom Sosnoff is live on tastylive, analyzing a potential iron condor trade. Your platform computes the probability of profit, renders the P&L curve with vol skew adjustment, displays the position Greeks, and allows the viewer to execute the exact same trade — all in real time, all powered by the Options Alpha platform you built. This convergence of live financial media and derivatives-native trading platform is unprecedented in the industry, and the engineering behind it is extraordinarily complex: real-time data synchronization between media production and trading systems, interactive strategy visualization that works in both broadcast and platform contexts, and order execution APIs that enable "trade-along" features with proper risk controls. Building this convergence layer is a challenge that only exists at Tastytrade, and it further differentiates the Options Alpha Platform Engineer role from any comparable position in the industry.

#### Global Levers

**1. The "I Am the Derivatives-Native Premium" Lever**
> "Let me be direct about my market position. I am an Options Alpha Platform Engineer — I have production experience building vol surface engines, real-time Greeks computation pipelines, multi-leg options order routing systems, and probability analytics platforms. I am not a general platform engineer who has read about options — I have implemented Black-Scholes pricing models, built vol surface interpolation algorithms, and designed Greeks aggregation systems that handle millions of positions at sub-second latency. The number of engineers worldwide who can do what I do is measured in hundreds, not thousands. My competing offers from [Citadel Securities/Jump Trading/IMC/DRW] are in the $420K-$528K TC range, and they reflect the reality that derivatives-native platform engineers are the scarcest engineering talent in fintech. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to include a structured Derivatives-Native premium — $50K-$80K above standard platform engineer comp — as a separate, named compensation element that reflects the strategic value of this capability."

**2. The "Billion-Dollar Integration" Lever**
> "IG Group paid $1B for Tastytrade, and a core reason for that valuation was Tastytrade's derivatives-native engineering capability — the exact capability I bring. As an Options Alpha Platform Engineer, I am the person who extends Tastytrade's derivatives-native platform to support IG Group's global multi-asset product suite. My work on the integration — adapting options pricing models for FX derivatives, extending Greeks computation to CFDs, building cross-asset vol surface infrastructure — directly increases the return on IG Group's $1B investment. I'd like to discuss compensation that reflects this strategic integration value, including RSU grants with acceleration triggers tied to integration milestones that I directly influence."

**3. The "Six-Box Scarcity" Lever**
> "This role requires an engineer who simultaneously possesses deep options pricing theory knowledge, vol surface engineering experience, production Greeks computation expertise, multi-leg order architecture skills, options market microstructure understanding, and Staff-level platform engineering capabilities. I have all six. In my experience, the overlap between 'understands stochastic volatility models' and 'can architect distributed systems at global scale' is extraordinarily small. I'd like my compensation to reflect this six-dimensional scarcity — specifically, total comp in the $480K-$528K range for Chicago, with proportional adjustments for New York or London."

**4. The "Platform Identity" Lever**
> "Tastytrade's identity as a derivatives-first platform — the thing that makes you different from every other brokerage — lives in the code that Options Alpha Platform Engineers write. I am not building features on top of a generic platform; I am building the platform that defines Tastytrade. When Tom Sosnoff says Tastytrade is for options traders, it's because engineers like me built the vol surface engine, the Greeks dashboard, the probability calculator, and the multi-leg strategy builder that make that statement true. My compensation should reflect the fact that I am building and maintaining Tastytrade's core competitive advantage — the derivatives-native platform experience that no competitor can replicate without engineers like me."

**5. The "Tom Sosnoff's Vision, Engineered" Lever**
> "Tom Sosnoff and Tony Battista have spent decades teaching high-probability options trading to millions of traders. They built Tastytrade because no existing platform adequately served the way they trade — visually, probabilistically, with deep Greeks awareness and multi-leg strategy sophistication. I am the engineer who translates that vision into technology. I build the systems that compute probability of profit the way Tom explains it on tastylive, that visualize risk the way professional options traders think about it, and that enable the trading strategies that Tastytrade was literally created to support. Engineers who understand both the trading philosophy and the platform engineering are the rarest people in Tastytrade's talent pool, and my compensation should reflect that."

**6. The "Global Derivatives Platform" Lever**
> "With IG Group's acquisition, Tastytrade is no longer building a US options platform — it is building the derivatives-native layer of a global multi-asset trading platform serving clients across the US, UK, Europe, Asia, and Australia. As an Options Alpha Platform Engineer, I am architecting systems that must handle equity options, FX options, CFDs, and structured products across multiple regulatory jurisdictions, time zones, and exchange connectivity models. This is one of the most complex platform engineering challenges in global finance, and I'd like my compensation — including base, RSU grants, and Derivatives-Native bonus — to reflect the global scope of this role. I'm targeting $480K-$528K TC for Chicago, with dual-currency negotiations for London placement."

#### Advanced Negotiation Tactics for the SIGNATURE ROLE

**Tactic 1: The "Named Compensation Element" Approach**
Do not negotiate the Derivatives-Native premium as a general salary increase. Instead, propose it as a named, structured compensation element — "Derivatives-Native Platform Premium" — that appears as a separate line item in your offer. Frame it as follows: "I'd like to propose a compensation structure that includes a Derivatives-Native Platform Premium of $50K-$80K, structured as $30K-$45K in additional base salary and $20K-$35K in annual bonus. This premium reflects the specialized nature of the Options Alpha Platform Engineer role and is consistent with the premiums that derivatives-native engineers command at competing firms." By naming it, you make it harder to remove and easier to benchmark against competing offers.

**Tactic 2: The "Integration Milestone RSU Acceleration" Play**
Negotiate RSU grants with acceleration triggers tied to specific Tastytrade-IG Group integration milestones. For example: "I'd like to propose that 25% of my RSU grant accelerates upon successful delivery of the cross-asset vol surface infrastructure that connects Tastytrade's options pricing with IG Group's FX derivatives pricing. This milestone-based acceleration aligns my compensation with the strategic integration objectives that make this role so valuable." This approach increases your effective annual comp by front-loading equity grants tied to deliverables you control.

**Tactic 3: The "Competitor Offer Stack" Framework**
At the SIGNATURE ROLE level, you should be simultaneously exploring opportunities at Citadel Securities, Jump Trading, IMC, DRW, Two Sigma, and the options/derivatives teams at Jane Street, Hudson River Trading, and Tower Research. These firms compete for the same talent pool, and their offers provide the benchmark for Options Alpha Platform Engineer compensation. When presenting competing offers, frame them specifically: "I have a competing offer from [firm] for $[amount] TC for a derivatives platform engineering role. The scope is comparable — building real-time pricing, Greeks computation, and order execution systems for derivatives markets. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to be competitive with this benchmark."

**Tactic 4: The "IG Group Equity Upside" Negotiation**
IG Group (LSE: IGG) is a publicly traded company with a clear growth story driven by the Tastytrade integration and global derivatives platform expansion. Negotiate RSU grants that give you meaningful exposure to this upside: "IG Group's stock has a clear growth catalyst in the Tastytrade integration — and as an Options Alpha Platform Engineer, I am directly driving that catalyst. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect my contribution to IG Group's growth story — specifically, a grant of $80K-$100K/yr vesting over 4 years, with potential for supplemental grants tied to platform milestones."

**Tactic 5: The "Dual-Role Valuation" Framework**
At many firms, the Options Alpha Platform Engineer role would be split between a quantitative developer (pricing models, Greeks computation) and a platform engineer (distributed systems, infrastructure). At Tastytrade, you do both. Frame this dual-role value explicitly: "In most organizations, the work I do would require two people — a quant developer for the pricing and Greeks computation, and a platform engineer for the distributed systems and infrastructure. I do both, which means Tastytrade gets quant-grade derivatives expertise and Staff-level platform engineering capability in a single hire. My compensation should reflect the full value of both roles — which is why I'm targeting the $480K-$528K TC range."

#### Detailed Regional Negotiation Strategies

**Chicago (Headquarters) — $362K-$528K TC**

Chicago is the global capital of derivatives trading, and the Options Alpha Platform Engineer role at Tastytrade HQ puts you at the center of that ecosystem. Your competitive set includes Citadel Securities, Jump Trading, DRW, IMC, Wolverine Trading, Peak6, and CBOE — all of which are within a few miles of Tastytrade's office and all of which compete for derivatives-native engineering talent.

Strategy: Anchor on the top of the range ($480K-$528K) by presenting competing offers from Chicago prop trading firms and derivatives exchanges. Emphasize that Tastytrade's Options Alpha Platform Engineer role requires the same derivatives expertise as a quant developer at a prop shop, plus the platform engineering skills to build and scale production systems. The compensation should reflect the combined value.

Key negotiation points for Chicago:
- Reference Citadel Securities quantitative developer comp ($450K-$600K+) as the true comparable, not general SWE comp
- Emphasize that Chicago derivatives firms are offering retention packages to prevent talent flight to tech companies
- Request a signing bonus of $50K-$75K to offset the opportunity cost of turning down competing Chicago offers
- Negotiate annual RSU refreshers of $60K-$80K/yr to maintain competitive total comp over the 4-year vesting period

**New York — $398K-$581K TC**

New York adds a 10% geographic premium but also puts you in proximity to IG Group's institutional clients and the broader Wall Street derivatives ecosystem. Options Alpha Platform Engineers based in New York may work on institutional-grade derivatives features, cross-border integration with IG Group's London operations, and connectivity with New York-based options exchanges.

Strategy: Anchor at $520K-$581K TC by combining the geographic premium with the institutional derivatives premium. Emphasize that New York-based Options Alpha Platform Engineers serve as the bridge between Tastytrade's retail options platform and IG Group's institutional derivatives capabilities — a dual mandate that justifies premium compensation.

Key negotiation points for New York:
- Reference Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan electronic trading comp as Wall Street comparables
- Emphasize proximity to NYSE, NASDAQ options markets, and institutional market makers
- Request New York cost-of-living adjustment above the standard 10% geographic premium for roles requiring physical presence in NYC
- Negotiate housing/relocation assistance if relocating from Chicago or other markets

**London — £276K-£403K / $345K-$503K TC**

London placement means working from IG Group HQ, directly interfacing with the parent company's global engineering and product organizations. Options Alpha Platform Engineers in London are the primary technical bridge between Tastytrade's derivatives-native architecture and IG Group's global platform — making this arguably the most strategically important placement for this role.

Strategy: Negotiate dual-currency with a floor of £360K / $450K TC by emphasizing the strategic integration leadership dimension. In London, you are not just an engineer — you are the embodiment of the Tastytrade acquisition's technical value, physically present at IG Group HQ to drive the integration that justifies the $1B acquisition price.

Key negotiation points for London:
- Negotiate in GBP but benchmark against USD-equivalent comp to ensure parity with Chicago and New York
- Reference IG Group's own senior engineering comp (publicly disclosed in annual reports) as a baseline, then add the Derivatives-Native premium
- Request dual-currency bonus structure: base in GBP, bonus with USD component to hedge currency risk
- Emphasize FCA regulatory expertise and UK derivatives market knowledge as additional premium justification
- Negotiate IG Group equity (LSE: IGG) at London-favorable grant sizes, as RSU grants at HQ may have different approval ceilings than subsidiary grants

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** The Options Alpha Platform Engineer is Tastytrade's SIGNATURE ROLE — the purest expression of the company's derivatives-native engineering identity. Your negotiation should be anchored in the undeniable reality that the number of engineers who can build vol surface engines, real-time Greeks computation pipelines, multi-leg options order routing systems, and probability analytics platforms at production scale is measured in hundreds worldwide. In **Chicago**, target $480K-$528K TC by stacking the Derivatives-Native premium ($50K-$80K) on top of Staff-level platform engineering comp, anchored by competing offers from Citadel Securities, Jump Trading, and DRW. In **New York**, push for $520K-$581K TC by adding the institutional derivatives premium and geographic adjustment. In **London**, negotiate dual-currency at £360K-£403K / $450K-$503K TC by leveraging the strategic integration value of being physically present at IG Group HQ as the derivatives-native platform expert. At every stage, frame the Derivatives-Native premium as a structured, named compensation element — not a general raise — and present the "Six-Box Scarcity" argument: deep options pricing theory, vol surface engineering, real-time Greeks computation, multi-leg order architecture, options market microstructure, and Staff-level platform engineering. No competing candidate has all six, and your compensation should reflect the fact that you do.
