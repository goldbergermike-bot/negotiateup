#### Negotiation DNA

Data Science at Tastytrade is fundamentally derivatives-native. You are not building recommendation engines for e-commerce or churn models for SaaS — you are modeling volatility surfaces, analyzing options flow patterns, computing probability distributions for multi-leg strategies, and building analytics systems that help millions of retail traders make high-probability trading decisions. Every model you build must account for the unique statistical properties of options markets: fat tails, volatility clustering, skew dynamics, and the non-linear payoff profiles of derivatives positions.

Tastytrade's entire brand was built on data-driven, high-probability trading. Tom Sosnoff and Tony Battista have spent decades teaching traders to think probabilistically — to sell premium when implied volatility is high, to manage positions based on Greeks, and to evaluate strategies by probability of profit rather than directional conviction. As a Data Scientist, you are building the analytical infrastructure that powers this philosophy — from backtesting frameworks that validate high-probability strategies across decades of options data to real-time analytics dashboards that surface actionable trading insights.

The IG Group acquisition expands your data universe dramatically. You now have access to global derivatives data — FX options, CFDs, spread bets — alongside Tastytrade's deep equity options dataset. Building models that span these asset classes, that identify cross-market patterns in volatility and flow, and that serve the combined platform's global user base requires a Data Scientist with genuine derivatives domain expertise.

#### Options Alpha — The Derivatives-Native Premium

As a Data Scientist at Tastytrade, the Derivatives-Native premium reflects your ability to build models and analytics systems that operate in the specialized statistical environment of options markets — where standard assumptions about normal distributions, linear relationships, and stationary processes break down.

- **The Derivatives-Native Bonus (8-15% above standard fintech):** Data Scientists with options/derivatives modeling expertise command a Derivatives-Native bonus of $15K-$40K above standard data science compensation at comparable fintech firms. This premium reflects your ability to model vol surfaces, analyze options flow data, compute probability distributions for complex spread strategies, and build analytics that incorporate the unique statistical properties of derivatives markets. At the DS level, this typically manifests as a $12K-$22K base uplift and a $8K-$18K annual bonus uplift.

- **High-Probability Trading Focus:** Your work directly powers Tastytrade's core value proposition — high-probability trading. You build models that compute probability of profit for arbitrary options strategies, that identify statistically favorable entry points based on implied volatility rank, and that backtest strategy variants across market regimes. This requires deep understanding of options pricing theory, stochastic processes, and the empirical properties of volatility — knowledge that most data scientists in fintech do not possess. Your ability to combine statistical rigor with derivatives domain expertise is the basis of the Derivatives-Native premium.

- **IG Group Global Integration:** Data Scientists driving the Tastytrade-IG Group data integration face the challenge of unifying derivatives analytics across fundamentally different asset classes. Equity options, FX options, and CFDs have different pricing models, different risk characteristics, and different data structures. Building analytics that span these asset classes — that provide unified risk views, cross-market volatility analysis, and global flow insights — requires a Data Scientist who understands the quantitative foundations of each product type. This cross-asset analytical capability is rare and commands premium compensation.

- **tastylive Media Network Synergy:** Data Scientists at Tastytrade may build the analytics that power tastylive's market analysis content — computing the statistics, probabilities, and market insights that Tom Sosnoff and other hosts discuss on air. This creates a unique feedback loop where your analytical work directly influences the financial media content consumed by millions of traders, and content engagement data flows back into platform analytics. Building models at this intersection of derivatives analytics and media impact measurement is a unique Data Science challenge.

#### Global Levers

**1. The "Derivatives Quantitative Expertise" Lever**
> "My data science work is specifically in the derivatives domain — I've built models for [vol surface construction/options flow analysis/probability-based strategy optimization/Greeks-based risk analytics]. This is fundamentally different from general fintech data science. I understand stochastic calculus, options pricing theory, and the empirical properties of volatility well enough to build production models without a quant team translating requirements. Competing offers from [CME/CBOE/Citadel] at $230K-$265K TC reflect the premium for data scientists with this derivatives quantitative background."

**2. The "Cross-Asset Analytics" Lever**
> "With IG Group's global data now available alongside Tastytrade's options data, there's a massive opportunity to build cross-asset analytics that span equity options, FX options, and CFDs. I bring experience modeling across multiple derivatives asset classes, which directly accelerates your ability to build unified analytics for the combined platform. I'd like my compensation to reflect this cross-asset analytical capability — a premium of $18K-$30K above standard data science comp."

**3. The "High-Probability Trading Analytics" Lever**
> "Tastytrade's brand is built on high-probability trading — and the analytical infrastructure behind that brand is what I'd be building and improving. I can point to specific models I've built that compute probability of profit, analyze volatility regime changes, and optimize strategy selection — exactly the analytics that power Tastytrade's trader education and platform features. I'd like a Derivatives-Native bonus that reflects the direct value of these analytical capabilities to Tastytrade's core business."

**4. The "Chicago Quant-DS Market" Lever**
> "Chicago's concentration of derivatives firms creates intense competition for data scientists with quantitative finance expertise. The line between 'data scientist' and 'quantitative researcher' blurs in the derivatives space — and compensation reflects that. I'm seeing DS comp packages of $210K-$265K at Chicago derivatives firms. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to be competitive at $240K-$265K TC, reflecting both the market rate and the Derivatives-Native premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Data Scientists at Tastytrade operate in the overlap between data science and quantitative finance — and compensation should reflect both disciplines. In **Chicago**, target $240K-$265K TC by anchoring on the quantitative researcher comp at CME Group, CBOE, and Citadel Securities, which is the true competitive set for derivatives-native data scientists. In **New York**, push for $265K-$292K TC by adding the geographic premium and emphasizing any experience with institutional derivatives analytics. In **London**, negotiate dual-currency at £180K-£202K / $225K-$252K TC — IG Group HQ needs data scientists who can bridge Tastytrade's options analytics with IG's global multi-asset data platform. The strongest lever is demonstrating quantitative finance knowledge (stochastic calculus, options pricing models, volatility modeling) alongside standard data science skills — this combination puts you in the "Derivatives-Native" category and justifies the 8-15% premium.
