#### Negotiation DNA

The Staff Software Engineer at Tastytrade is the technical fulcrum of the entire derivatives-native platform. You are setting the architectural direction for systems that handle real-time options pricing across tens of thousands of contracts, computing portfolio-level Greeks for millions of positions, and orchestrating multi-leg options order routing with microsecond precision. At this level, you are not just building features — you are defining the technical strategy that determines whether Tastytrade can scale its high-probability trading platform to a global audience through the IG Group integration.

This is a role that exists at the intersection of extreme technical depth and extreme domain specificity. A Staff SWE at a general fintech company might architect payment systems or lending platforms — important but fundamentally commodity engineering. A Staff SWE at Tastytrade is architecting volatility surface computation engines, real-time risk aggregation systems that span equity options, FX options, and CFDs, and strategy optimization frameworks that encode decades of Tom Sosnoff's high-probability trading philosophy into algorithmic systems. The scarcity of engineers who can operate at this intersection is the foundation of your negotiating position.

The IG Group dimension multiplies this scarcity. Post-acquisition, the Staff-level mandate includes driving the architectural integration of Tastytrade's options-native platform with IG Group's global multi-asset infrastructure. This means designing systems that can handle regulatory divergence (SEC/CFTC vs. FCA), market microstructure differences (equity options vs. FX vs. CFDs), and latency requirements that span Chicago, New York, and London. Staff engineers who can credibly lead this integration are extraordinarily rare and should be compensated accordingly.

#### Options Alpha — The Derivatives-Native Premium

At the Staff level, the Derivatives-Native premium is at its most powerful because your architectural decisions directly shape how Tastytrade's platform handles the core derivatives challenges — options pricing, risk management, and strategy execution at global scale.

- **The Derivatives-Native Bonus (8-15% above standard fintech):** Staff engineers with deep options/derivatives architecture expertise command a Derivatives-Native bonus of $25K-$67K above standard staff SWE compensation at comparable fintech firms. This premium — 8-15% of total comp — reflects your ability to design systems that model vol surfaces at scale, compute portfolio Greeks in real time, and route complex multi-leg options orders across fragmented markets. At the staff level, this typically manifests as a $25K-$40K base uplift, a $12K-$20K annual bonus uplift, and potential for $10K-$15K/yr in additional RSU grants tied to platform architecture milestones.

- **High-Probability Trading Focus:** As a Staff engineer, you are encoding Tastytrade's high-probability trading philosophy into the platform's architectural DNA. You design the systems that calculate probability of profit across complex multi-leg strategies, optimize Greeks exposure at the portfolio level, and surface actionable trading insights derived from volatility analysis. This is not generic platform engineering — it requires deep understanding of options pricing theory, market microstructure, and the specific trading strategies that Tastytrade's user base employs. Your architectural decisions have direct P&L impact on millions of traders, and your compensation should reflect that responsibility.

- **IG Group Global Integration:** Staff engineers at Tastytrade are the primary architects of the IG Group integration — the single most strategically important engineering initiative since the $1B acquisition. You are designing the unified platform layer that connects Tastytrade's options-native architecture with IG's global FX, CFD, and spread betting infrastructure. This involves solving cross-asset risk aggregation, multi-jurisdictional regulatory compliance (data residency, margin requirements, position reporting), and real-time cross-market analytics. Each of these architectural challenges requires derivatives-native engineering at the highest level and commands premium compensation that reflects the strategic value of the integration.

- **tastylive Media Network Synergy:** At the Staff level, you may architect the platform-content convergence layer — the systems that connect Tastytrade's trading platform with the tastylive media network to create a unified experience where market analysis, educational content, and actionable trading tools are seamlessly integrated. This requires designing real-time data pipelines that feed live market data and strategy analytics into content production workflows, and building APIs that enable content creators (including Tom Sosnoff and Tony Battista) to demonstrate trading concepts with live platform integration. This is a unique architectural challenge that amplifies the Derivatives-Native premium.

#### Global Levers

**1. The "Architectural Scarcity" Lever**
> "At the Staff level, I'm setting the architectural direction for Tastytrade's derivatives-native platform — designing systems that handle real-time vol surface computation, portfolio-level Greeks aggregation, and multi-leg options order routing at global scale. I can point to specific systems I've architected that handle [volume/scale metrics] in derivatives processing. Engineers who can architect at this level with deep derivatives domain knowledge are exceptionally rare — my competing offers from [Citadel/CME/Jump Trading] reflect this, coming in at $380K-$445K TC. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to include a substantial Derivatives-Native premium that reflects this architectural expertise."

**2. The "IG Group Integration Architect" Lever**
> "The Tastytrade-IG Group integration is a billion-dollar architectural challenge — unifying two fundamentally different platforms across asset classes, regulatory regimes, and geographies. At the Staff level, I would be one of the primary architects driving this integration. My experience designing cross-platform systems that span multiple asset classes and regulatory frameworks directly reduces the risk and timeline of this strategic initiative. I'd like to discuss how my compensation — including a structured Derivatives-Native bonus and accelerated RSU vesting — reflects the value of de-risking this integration."

**3. The "Chicago Derivatives Capital" Lever**
> "Chicago's derivatives ecosystem — CME, CBOE, Citadel, Jump Trading, Tastytrade — creates intense competition for Staff-level engineers with derivatives architecture expertise. I'm seeing total comp packages of $350K-$450K+ for Staff SWE roles at Chicago derivatives firms, with the strongest packages going to architects who can design systems that handle options pricing, risk computation, and multi-asset trading at scale. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to be at the top of this range — $400K-$445K TC — reflecting both the competitive market and the Derivatives-Native premium for this level of architectural responsibility."

**4. The "Platform Destiny" Lever**
> "Tastytrade's future as a global derivatives platform — Tom Sosnoff's original vision scaled through IG Group's global reach — depends on the architectural decisions being made right now. At the Staff level, I'm not just building features; I'm determining whether the platform can handle global options volume, cross-asset risk management, and real-time analytics at the scale IG Group's distribution network demands. I'd like my compensation to reflect this architectural impact — specifically, a total comp package that includes a Derivatives-Native bonus of $30K-$50K and RSU grants that vest accelerated against integration milestones."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** The Staff level is where the Derivatives-Native premium has maximum impact — $25K-$67K above standard fintech comp. In **Chicago**, target $400K-$445K TC by leading with architectural scarcity and anchoring on Citadel Securities, Jump Trading, and CME Group competing offers. In **New York**, push for $440K-$490K TC by emphasizing the dual-hub value of a Staff engineer who can drive integration across Tastytrade's Chicago HQ and IG Group's New York institutional presence. In **London**, negotiate dual-currency at £300K-£339K / $375K-$424K TC — Staff engineers at IG Group HQ who bridge Tastytrade's derivatives-native architecture are uniquely valuable and should be compensated at the top of IG Group's London engineering band. Always negotiate RSU grants as a separate line item with potential for acceleration tied to integration milestones — this is a lever unique to the Staff level at a post-acquisition subsidiary.
