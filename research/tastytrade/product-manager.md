#### Negotiation DNA

Product Management at Tastytrade is unlike PM work at any other fintech company. You are not defining features for a generic brokerage or payment platform — you are shaping the product experience for active options traders who think in Greeks, evaluate trades by probability of profit, and execute multi-leg strategies that require specialized order entry, risk visualization, and position management tools. Your product decisions must reflect deep understanding of how options traders think, because your users will immediately see through superficial or generalist product design.

The Tastytrade platform was born from Tom Sosnoff's conviction that options trading should be accessible, visual, and probability-driven. As a Product Manager, you are the custodian of this vision — defining product roadmaps that extend the platform's derivatives-native capabilities while integrating IG Group's global multi-asset features. This dual mandate — preserving Tastytrade's options-focused identity while expanding through IG Group's global reach — creates a product strategy challenge that few PMs have the domain knowledge to navigate.

Since the $1B IG Group acquisition, Product Managers at Tastytrade operate at the intersection of two product organizations with fundamentally different user bases. Tastytrade serves active options traders who prioritize speed, probability analysis, and multi-leg strategy tools. IG Group serves a global audience trading FX, CFDs, and spread bets who prioritize market access, leverage management, and regulatory compliance. PMs who can define product strategy that serves both audiences — who understand the derivatives domain deeply enough to make sound prioritization calls — are rare and should negotiate accordingly.

#### Options Alpha — The Derivatives-Native Premium

As a Product Manager at Tastytrade, the Derivatives-Native premium reflects your ability to make product decisions that require deep understanding of options trading mechanics, probability theory, and derivatives market structure.

- **The Derivatives-Native Bonus (8-15% above standard fintech):** Product Managers with demonstrated options/derivatives domain expertise command a Derivatives-Native bonus of $15K-$41K above standard PM compensation at comparable fintech firms. This premium reflects your ability to define product requirements that accurately model options pricing behavior, design UX flows for complex multi-leg strategies, and prioritize features that align with high-probability trading philosophy. At the PM level, this typically manifests as a $12K-$22K base uplift and a $8K-$19K annual bonus uplift.

- **High-Probability Trading Focus:** Tastytrade's product philosophy is inseparable from high-probability trading strategy. You must understand concepts like probability of profit, expected move, implied volatility rank, and portfolio Greeks deeply enough to translate them into product features that active traders find intuitive and powerful. PMs who can spec a feature like "real-time P&L visualization for iron condors adjusted for vol skew" without needing engineering to explain the domain — who can write PRDs that speak the language of options traders — command the Derivatives-Native premium because they dramatically accelerate feature delivery.

- **IG Group Global Integration:** Product Managers driving the Tastytrade-IG Group product integration must understand how derivatives products differ across the two platforms. Options chains, multi-leg strategy builders, and Greeks dashboards have no direct equivalents in IG Group's FX/CFD product suite. PMs who can define integration strategies that bring options-native features to IG Group's global platform — or that bring IG Group's multi-asset capabilities into Tastytrade's derivatives-focused UI — are solving product challenges that require deep domain knowledge and command premium compensation.

- **tastylive Media Network Synergy:** Product Managers at Tastytrade uniquely shape the intersection of trading platform and financial media. You may define product features that integrate tastylive content with platform functionality — enabling traders to follow along with Tom Sosnoff's live trading, execute strategies demonstrated on tastylive shows, and access educational content contextually within the trading platform. This content-platform product convergence is a rare PM challenge that adds further justification for Derivatives-Native premium compensation.

#### Global Levers

**1. The "Derivatives Product Expertise" Lever**
> "My value as a PM at Tastytrade is fundamentally different from a PM at a general fintech. I understand options pricing, Greeks, multi-leg strategies, and probability-based trading well enough to write product requirements that don't require translation from traders to engineers. I can spec features like real-time vol surface visualization, probability-of-profit calculators, and multi-leg order entry flows with the precision that Tastytrade's user base demands. Competing PM offers from [IBKR/CME/CBOE] reflect a 10-15% Derivatives-Native premium for this domain expertise. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to match."

**2. The "IG Group Product Integration" Lever**
> "The Tastytrade-IG Group product integration requires a PM who understands both options-native product design and global multi-asset platform strategy. I can navigate the product challenges of bringing Tastytrade's derivatives-focused features to IG Group's global user base — and vice versa. This cross-platform product strategy capability directly reduces integration risk and accelerates time-to-market for integrated products. I'd like my compensation to reflect this integration PM premium."

**3. The "Trader-PM" Lever**
> "I'm not just a PM who has read about options — I actively trade options and understand the platform experience from the user's perspective. I know what it feels like to manage a portfolio of iron condors through a volatility spike, and I can translate that experience into product requirements that genuinely improve the trader experience. PMs who combine product management expertise with active derivatives trading experience are extremely rare, and I'd like my Tastytrade comp to include a Derivatives-Native premium of $18K-$30K reflecting this unique combination."

**4. The "Chicago Trading Ecosystem" Lever**
> "Chicago's derivatives ecosystem means Tastytrade competes for derivatives-savvy PMs against CME Group, CBOE, and multiple prop trading firms that all need product managers who understand options markets. I'm seeing PM comp packages of $220K-$275K at Chicago derivatives firms for PMs with my level of domain expertise. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to be competitive at $245K-$272K TC."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Product Managers at Tastytrade must demonstrate genuine derivatives domain knowledge — not just fintech PM experience. In **Chicago**, target $245K-$272K TC by anchoring on CME Group and CBOE PM compensation and emphasizing your ability to write derivatives-native product specs without translation. In **New York**, push for $270K-$299K TC by adding the geographic premium and any experience with institutional derivatives products relevant to IG Group's New York presence. In **London**, negotiate dual-currency at £185K-£207K / $231K-$259K TC — product strategy roles at IG Group HQ that bridge Tastytrade's options focus with global multi-asset products are premium positions. The strongest lever is demonstrating that you personally trade options and can immediately contribute to product decisions without a derivatives domain learning curve.
