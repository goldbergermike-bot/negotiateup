#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Management at Tastytrade is fundamentally different from engineering management at a general fintech company. You are not managing teams that build payment rails or lending platforms — you are leading teams that build real-time options pricing engines, multi-leg strategy execution systems, and risk management platforms that serve active derivatives traders. Your team's output directly affects how millions of traders interact with options markets, and your ability to recruit, retain, and guide derivatives-native engineers is the core of your value proposition.

The IG Group acquisition has made the Engineering Manager role at Tastytrade exponentially more complex and more valuable. You are now managing teams that span two organizational cultures (Tastytrade's startup DNA and IG Group's public-company rigor), two geographies (Chicago and London), and two platform paradigms (options-native and multi-asset global). Your ability to navigate this complexity — to deliver integration milestones while preserving Tastytrade's derivatives-focused engineering culture — is a lever that commands premium compensation.

Tom Sosnoff and Tony Battista built Tastytrade with a trader's mentality: move fast, take calculated risks, and focus on high-probability outcomes. As an Engineering Manager, you are translating this philosophy into engineering team culture — building teams that ship derivatives features rapidly, that understand the Greeks and can reason about vol surfaces in sprint planning, and that maintain the options-trader mindset that differentiates Tastytrade from every other brokerage. Managers who can build and lead this kind of derivatives-native team are exceptionally scarce.

#### Options Alpha — The Derivatives-Native Premium

As an Engineering Manager at Tastytrade, the Derivatives-Native premium applies not only to your personal domain expertise but also to your ability to build, recruit, and retain derivatives-native engineering teams — a talent management challenge that is uniquely difficult in the derivatives technology space.

- **The Derivatives-Native Bonus (8-15% above standard fintech):** Engineering Managers with options/derivatives domain expertise and a track record of building derivatives-native engineering teams command a Derivatives-Native bonus of $20K-$54K above standard EM compensation at comparable fintech firms. This premium — 8-15% of total comp — reflects your dual value as both a derivatives-domain technical leader and a manager who can recruit from the scarce pool of engineers who understand Greeks, vol surfaces, and options pricing. At the EM level, this typically manifests as a $20K-$30K base uplift and a $10K-$24K annual bonus uplift.

- **High-Probability Trading Focus:** Your teams build the platform features that embody Tastytrade's high-probability trading philosophy. You must be able to evaluate technical approaches to probability-of-profit computation, Greeks-based portfolio analysis, and multi-leg strategy optimization. During sprint planning and architecture reviews, your derivatives domain knowledge directly improves team output quality and velocity. Managers who can provide substantive technical guidance on derivatives-specific engineering challenges — not just generic management — command a measurable premium.

- **IG Group Global Integration:** The IG Group integration is as much a people and organizational challenge as it is a technical one. Engineering Managers who can bridge the cultural gap between Tastytrade's Chicago-based, options-focused engineering teams and IG Group's London-based, multi-asset global engineering organization are critical to integration success. Your ability to manage distributed teams across these two organizations — aligning priorities, resolving architectural disagreements, and maintaining engineering velocity during integration — is a rare leadership skill that justifies premium compensation.

- **tastylive Media Network Synergy:** Managing the engineering teams that connect Tastytrade's trading platform with the tastylive media network requires understanding both the content production pipeline and the derivatives domain. Your teams build the systems that enable live trading demonstrations, real-time strategy analysis, and educational content integrated with platform features. Managing this cross-functional engineering challenge — where your team must serve both traders and content creators — adds a unique dimension to the EM role that further justifies the Derivatives-Native premium.

#### Global Levers

**1. The "Derivatives Team Builder" Lever**
> "My most significant value to Tastytrade is my ability to build and retain derivatives-native engineering teams. I've recruited and managed teams of [X] engineers working on [specific derivatives systems], and I understand how rare this talent pool is. At competing firms — CME Group, CBOE, Citadel Securities — Engineering Manager comp for derivatives teams is $290K-$360K TC because these firms recognize that the EM who can build a derivatives-native team is as valuable as any individual contributor. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to reflect this team-building premium."

**2. The "IG Integration Bridge" Lever**
> "The Tastytrade-IG Group integration will succeed or fail based on how well Chicago and London engineering teams collaborate. I bring experience managing distributed, cross-cultural engineering teams, and I understand the derivatives domain deeply enough to resolve technical disagreements between options-native and multi-asset engineering approaches. I'd like to discuss how my compensation reflects the integration leadership premium — managing across two organizations, two geographies, and two platform paradigms simultaneously."

**3. The "Chicago Derivatives EM Market" Lever**
> "The market for Engineering Managers with derivatives domain expertise in Chicago is extremely competitive. CME Group, CBOE, Citadel Securities, and multiple prop trading firms are all competing for the same small pool of managers who understand both engineering leadership and derivatives technology. I'm seeing total comp packages of $280K-$358K for EM roles at Chicago derivatives firms. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to be at $320K-$358K TC to reflect both the market rate and the Derivatives-Native premium for managing options-focused engineering teams."

**4. The "Culture Preservation" Lever**
> "Tastytrade's engineering culture — the trader's mentality, the focus on high-probability outcomes, the connection to Tom Sosnoff's vision — is a strategic asset that must be preserved through the IG Group integration. As an Engineering Manager, I would be a steward of that culture. I understand the derivatives domain well enough to maintain Tastytrade's options-native engineering identity while also integrating with IG Group's global platform requirements. I'd like my compensation to include a structured Derivatives-Native bonus that reflects the value of preserving this unique engineering culture."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Engineering Managers at Tastytrade carry dual responsibility — technical derivatives domain leadership and organizational integration leadership — and compensation should reflect both dimensions. In **Chicago**, target $320K-$358K TC by anchoring on CME Group and Citadel Securities EM compensation and emphasizing your ability to recruit derivatives-native engineers in a tight Chicago talent market. In **New York**, push for $350K-$393K TC by adding the geographic premium and emphasizing cross-hub management responsibilities. In **London**, negotiate dual-currency at £245K-£273K / $306K-$341K TC — IG Group HQ values EMs who can bridge the Tastytrade-IG engineering cultures, and you should press this integration leadership premium hard. Always negotiate the Derivatives-Native bonus as a separate, additive line item and request explicit integration milestone targets tied to bonus accelerators.
