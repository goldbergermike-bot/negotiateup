#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Management at Tastytrade is defined by one overarching reality: you are managing programs that deliver derivatives-native trading technology. This is not managing a payment platform migration or a CRM integration — you are coordinating the delivery of real-time options pricing systems, multi-leg strategy execution engines, and Greeks computation pipelines where delays are measured in financial impact to active traders. Every sprint, every milestone, and every cross-team dependency you manage has a direct line to whether Tastytrade's platform can reliably serve options traders making time-sensitive trading decisions.

The IG Group acquisition has made the TPM role at Tastytrade one of the most complex and strategically important program management positions in fintech. You are managing integration programs that span two engineering organizations (Chicago and London), two platform architectures (options-native and multi-asset global), and two regulatory frameworks (SEC/CFTC and FCA). The success of this $1B integration depends on program managers who can navigate the technical complexity of derivatives platform integration while managing organizational and cultural alignment between Tastytrade and IG Group.

Tom Sosnoff built Tastytrade with a trader's sense of urgency — decisions are fast, execution is decisive, and results are measured by whether traders can trade better. As a TPM, you must embody this culture while bringing the structured program management rigor that a publicly-traded parent company (IG Group, LSE: IGG) requires. This dual mandate — startup velocity with public-company governance — is a distinctive feature of the TPM role at Tastytrade.

#### Options Alpha — The Derivatives-Native Premium

As a TPM at Tastytrade, the Derivatives-Native premium reflects your ability to manage programs that deliver derivatives trading technology — where you must understand the domain well enough to assess technical risks, resolve cross-team dependencies, and make trade-off decisions that account for the unique requirements of options trading systems.

- **The Derivatives-Native Bonus (8-15% above standard fintech):** TPMs with options/derivatives program management expertise command a Derivatives-Native bonus of $14K-$38K above standard TPM compensation at comparable fintech firms. This premium reflects your ability to manage programs involving real-time pricing systems, multi-leg order execution, Greeks computation, and vol surface analytics — where program risks have financial consequences and delivery timelines are tied to market events (options expiration cycles, regulatory deadlines). At the TPM level, this typically manifests as a $12K-$22K base uplift and a $6K-$16K annual bonus uplift.

- **High-Probability Trading Focus:** Managing programs that deliver Tastytrade's high-probability trading features requires understanding what those features do and why they matter. When your engineering team says they need two more sprints to optimize the probability-of-profit computation pipeline, you need to understand whether that's a legitimate technical challenge or scope creep. When product asks for a new Greeks visualization feature, you need to understand the engineering complexity of real-time Greeks streaming well enough to give accurate delivery estimates. TPMs who can make these derivatives-domain-informed program decisions — without requiring constant translation from engineers — are rare and command premium comp.

- **IG Group Global Integration:** The Tastytrade-IG Group integration is the flagship program management challenge at Tastytrade. You are managing workstreams that span two organizations, two geographies, and two platform architectures, with dependencies that cross asset classes (options, FX, CFDs), regulatory regimes (US, UK), and engineering cultures (Tastytrade startup DNA, IG Group public-company processes). TPMs who can manage this level of cross-organizational, cross-jurisdictional program complexity with derivatives domain understanding are exceptionally valuable.

- **tastylive Media Network Synergy:** TPMs at Tastytrade may manage programs that deliver features spanning both the trading platform and the tastylive media network — coordinating between media production teams, content creators (including Tom Sosnoff and Tony Battista), engineering teams, and product managers to deliver integrated experiences. This cross-functional program complexity — spanning trading technology and media delivery — is unique to Tastytrade and adds another dimension to the TPM role.

#### Global Levers

**1. The "Integration Program Leadership" Lever**
> "The Tastytrade-IG Group integration is one of the most complex program management challenges in fintech — spanning two organizations, two geographies, two platform architectures, and two regulatory frameworks. I bring experience managing multi-stakeholder integration programs in financial technology, and I understand the derivatives domain well enough to assess technical risks, resolve architectural dependencies, and make informed trade-off decisions. I'd like my compensation to include an integration program leadership premium — $18K-$30K above standard TPM comp — reflecting the strategic value of this program management capability."

**2. The "Derivatives Domain Fluency" Lever**
> "As a TPM managing derivatives platform delivery, I don't need engineers to translate domain concepts for me. I understand options pricing, Greeks, vol surfaces, and multi-leg strategies well enough to evaluate technical proposals, assess delivery risks, and make program decisions that account for the unique requirements of derivatives trading systems. This derivatives domain fluency dramatically improves program efficiency and reduces miscommunication risk. I'd like a Derivatives-Native bonus that reflects this specialized program management value."

**3. The "Market-Driven Delivery" Lever**
> "Derivatives platform delivery is fundamentally different from generic software delivery because it's tied to market cycles. Options expiration dates, regulatory filing deadlines, and market events create hard delivery targets that cannot be moved. I understand these market-driven constraints and have managed programs that delivered trading technology on schedules dictated by markets rather than sprints. This market-aware program management capability is rare and should be reflected in premium compensation."

**4. The "Chicago Derivatives TPM Market" Lever**
> "Chicago's concentration of derivatives exchanges and trading firms creates genuine demand for TPMs who understand derivatives technology delivery. I'm seeing TPM comp packages of $210K-$255K at Chicago derivatives firms for TPMs with domain expertise and integration program experience. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to be competitive at $230K-$255K TC."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** TPMs at Tastytrade carry the weight of delivering derivatives-native trading technology across a complex, multi-organizational landscape. In **Chicago**, target $230K-$255K TC by anchoring on CME Group and CBOE TPM compensation and emphasizing your derivatives domain fluency and integration program management experience. In **New York**, push for $255K-$281K TC by adding the geographic premium and experience with cross-region program management. In **London**, negotiate dual-currency at £170K-£194K / $213K-$243K TC — IG Group HQ needs TPMs who can bridge the Tastytrade-IG integration program across Chicago and London, and this cross-organizational program leadership is premium-compensated. The strongest lever is demonstrating that you understand derivatives technology well enough to manage programs without requiring constant domain translation — frame yourself as a "Derivatives-Native TPM" who accelerates delivery by eliminating the domain knowledge gap between program management and engineering teams.
