#### Negotiation DNA

Product Design at Tastytrade is one of the most technically demanding design roles in all of fintech. You are not designing a simple stock-buying experience or a clean mobile banking interface — you are designing interactive systems that visualize vol surfaces, render real-time Greeks across multi-leg options positions, display probability distributions for complex spread strategies, and enable rapid multi-leg order entry for traders who measure platform quality in milliseconds. Tastytrade's design language was forged by Tom Sosnoff's conviction that options trading should be visual, intuitive, and probability-driven, and maintaining that design philosophy while scaling globally through IG Group requires designers with genuine derivatives domain understanding.

The visual complexity of options trading is staggering compared to equity trading or banking. An options chain alone contains hundreds of strikes across dozens of expirations, each with multiple Greeks that change in real time. A single position might involve four legs with different strikes, expirations, and Greeks profiles — all of which must be visualized clearly enough for a trader to make split-second decisions. Designing for this complexity requires a designer who understands not just information architecture and interaction design, but the actual domain of options trading. This derivatives-native design capability is rare and commands premium compensation.

IG Group's acquisition adds another dimension: you are now designing for two distinct user populations with different mental models. Tastytrade's users think in options chains, probability curves, and Greeks dashboards. IG Group's users think in price charts, leverage ratios, and margin levels. Designing a unified experience — or elegantly bridging these two paradigms — requires a designer who deeply understands both derivatives trading and multi-asset global platform UX.

#### Options Alpha — The Derivatives-Native Premium

As a Product Designer at Tastytrade, the Derivatives-Native premium reflects your ability to design interfaces for inherently complex derivatives products without oversimplifying to the point of losing functionality that active options traders require.

- **The Derivatives-Native Bonus (8-15% above standard fintech):** Product Designers with options/derivatives domain expertise command a Derivatives-Native bonus of $12K-$31K above standard design compensation at comparable fintech firms. This premium reflects your ability to design options chains, Greeks dashboards, vol surface visualizations, and multi-leg strategy builders that are both information-dense and intuitively usable. At the designer level, this typically manifests as a $10K-$18K base uplift and a $5K-$13K annual bonus uplift.

- **High-Probability Trading Focus:** Tastytrade's design philosophy is built around making high-probability trading strategies visual and accessible. You design interfaces that communicate probability of profit, expected move, and risk/reward profiles through visual language that traders can process in seconds. Designing a probability curve for an iron condor, or a Greeks heat map across a portfolio of positions, requires understanding what these concepts mean mathematically and how traders use them to make decisions. Designers who can create these interfaces without extensive hand-holding from quant teams are rare and valuable.

- **IG Group Global Integration:** Designing the unified Tastytrade-IG Group experience requires navigating two fundamentally different design paradigms. Tastytrade's UI is dense, information-rich, and optimized for active traders who want maximum data visibility. IG Group's platforms tend toward cleaner, more mainstream design that serves a broader audience. Bridging these approaches — maintaining Tastytrade's derivatives power-user experience while potentially introducing IG Group's more accessible design patterns for newer traders — is a complex design challenge that requires deep understanding of both platform cultures.

- **tastylive Media Network Synergy:** Designing the intersection of trading platform and financial media creates unique UX challenges. You may design experiences where Tom Sosnoff's live trading commentary is integrated with real-time platform functionality, where educational content is contextually surfaced alongside relevant trading tools, and where social trading features connect tastylive viewers with actionable strategies. This media-platform design convergence is unique to Tastytrade and requires a designer who understands both content UX and derivatives trading UX.

#### Global Levers

**1. The "Derivatives Visualization Specialist" Lever**
> "Designing for options traders is fundamentally more complex than designing for equity traders or banking users. I've designed interfaces for [specific derivatives visualizations: options chains, Greeks dashboards, P&L curves, vol surfaces] that handle the information density active traders demand while remaining intuitive. This specialization in derivatives-native UX is extremely rare — most designers have never worked with options data — and competing offers from [IBKR/CME/CBOE] reflect a 10-12% premium for this domain expertise. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to include a Derivatives-Native design premium."

**2. The "IG Group Design Bridge" Lever**
> "The Tastytrade-IG Group design integration is a significant UX challenge — bridging a derivatives power-user platform with a global multi-asset platform serving a more mainstream audience. I bring experience designing for complex financial products across different user segments, and I understand the options domain well enough to make design decisions that preserve Tastytrade's derivatives-native experience while extending to new audiences. I'd like my compensation to reflect this cross-platform design integration value."

**3. The "Trader-Designer" Lever**
> "I don't just design for options traders — I am an options trader. I understand what it feels like to scan an options chain for a high-probability setup, to need instant visual feedback on a multi-leg position's Greeks, and to execute a complex order under time pressure. This lived experience directly improves my design work for Tastytrade's platform. Designers who combine UX expertise with active derivatives trading experience are extraordinarily rare, and I'd like a Derivatives-Native premium of $15K-$25K to reflect this unique value."

**4. The "Chicago Design Market" Lever**
> "Chicago's concentration of derivatives firms — CME, CBOE, Tastytrade, and multiple prop shops — creates genuine competition for designers who understand financial product UX. I'm seeing design comp packages of $165K-$210K at Chicago derivatives firms for designers with my level of domain expertise. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to be competitive at $185K-$208K TC."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Product Designers at Tastytrade compete in a niche market — designers who understand derivatives UX are far scarcer than general product designers. In **Chicago**, target $185K-$208K TC by anchoring on the tiny pool of designers with options/derivatives UX experience and referencing competing offers from CME Group, CBOE, or prop trading firms. In **New York**, push for $205K-$229K TC with the geographic premium and any experience designing for institutional-grade trading interfaces. In **London**, negotiate dual-currency at £140K-£159K / $175K-$199K TC — IG Group HQ values designers who can bridge Tastytrade's options-native design language with IG Group's global platform design system. The strongest lever is a portfolio that includes derivatives-specific UX work: options chain designs, Greeks visualizations, or multi-leg strategy builders that demonstrate you can design for this domain immediately.
