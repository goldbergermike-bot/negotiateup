#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineering at Tastytrade is where machine learning meets derivatives mathematics — and the combination is explosively valuable. You are not building generic recommendation engines or chatbots — you are building models that predict volatility regimes, optimize options strategy selection based on market conditions, detect anomalous options flow patterns, personalize trading experiences for derivatives-savvy users, and generate AI-driven insights that help millions of retail traders make high-probability decisions. Every model you build must account for the unique statistical properties of options markets: fat-tailed distributions, volatility clustering, non-linear payoff structures, and the complex interplay of Greeks.

Tastytrade's founding vision — making high-probability options trading accessible to everyone — is the perfect canvas for ML/AI. Tom Sosnoff and Tony Battista have spent decades teaching probabilistic thinking to retail traders, and AI models that codify and extend this philosophy (strategy recommendation, risk optimization, market regime detection) are central to the platform's evolution. ML/AI engineers who understand both the machine learning techniques and the derivatives domain context are building the next generation of Tastytrade's competitive advantage.

The IG Group acquisition unlocks ML/AI opportunities at global scale. With IG Group's data across FX, CFDs, spread bets, and equity options, ML/AI engineers at Tastytrade can build cross-asset models that identify patterns spanning multiple derivatives markets — volatility contagion across asset classes, cross-market flow signals, and multi-product strategy optimization. This global multi-asset AI challenge, grounded in derivatives domain expertise, positions Tastytrade's ML/AI team at the frontier of financial AI.

#### Options Alpha — The Derivatives-Native Premium

As an ML/AI Engineer at Tastytrade, the Derivatives-Native premium reflects your ability to build machine learning models that operate in the specialized mathematical environment of options markets — where standard ML assumptions about stationary distributions, linear features, and independent observations break down spectacularly.

- **The Derivatives-Native Bonus (8-15% above standard fintech):** ML/AI Engineers with options/derivatives modeling expertise command a Derivatives-Native bonus of $20K-$54K above standard ML engineering compensation at comparable fintech firms. This premium reflects your ability to build models that account for volatility clustering, fat-tailed return distributions, non-linear options payoffs, and the complex interactions between Greeks. At the ML/AI level, this typically manifests as a $20K-$32K base uplift, a $10K-$18K annual bonus uplift, and potential for additional RSU grants tied to model performance milestones.

- **High-Probability Trading Focus:** Tastytrade's brand is built on high-probability trading, and ML/AI models that extend this philosophy are the platform's next competitive frontier. You build models that identify high-probability options setups based on implied volatility rank, historical vol patterns, and market regime classification. You design recommendation systems that suggest optimal strategy structures (iron condors, strangles, verticals) based on a trader's risk profile, portfolio Greeks, and market conditions. You build anomaly detection systems that identify unusual options flow — potential signal for informed trading activity. Each of these ML applications requires deep understanding of both machine learning techniques and options trading mechanics.

- **IG Group Global Integration:** ML/AI engineers driving cross-asset model development across Tastytrade and IG Group are building models that span multiple derivatives markets — detecting volatility transmission patterns between equity options and FX markets, identifying cross-asset trading opportunities, and building unified risk models that incorporate options, FX, and CFD positions. This cross-asset ML challenge requires understanding the quantitative foundations of each derivatives product type and commands premium compensation reflecting the rarity of this combined ML and multi-asset derivatives expertise.

- **tastylive Media Network Synergy:** ML/AI engineers at Tastytrade may build models that power content personalization on the tastylive media network — recommending educational content based on a trader's portfolio composition, strategy preferences, and skill level. They may also build NLP models that extract trading insights from tastylive market commentary, or generative AI systems that create personalized market analysis based on a trader's positions and watchlists. This intersection of financial AI and media personalization is a unique ML challenge at Tastytrade.

#### Global Levers

**1. The "Derivatives ML Specialist" Lever**
> "Building ML models for options markets requires fundamentally different approaches than standard fintech ML. I work with non-stationary, fat-tailed data distributions where standard assumptions break down. I've built models for [volatility prediction/strategy optimization/flow anomaly detection/regime classification] that account for the unique statistical properties of derivatives markets — volatility clustering, non-linear payoffs, Greeks interactions. This derivatives-native ML expertise is the intersection of two rare skill sets, and competing offers from [Citadel/Two Sigma/Jump Trading] at $310K-$362K TC reflect this scarcity."

**2. The "Cross-Asset AI" Lever**
> "With IG Group's global data spanning FX, CFDs, and equity options, Tastytrade has a unique opportunity to build cross-asset ML models that identify patterns no single-asset model can capture. I bring experience building ML models across multiple financial asset classes and can accelerate the development of cross-market AI capabilities. I'd like my compensation to reflect this cross-asset ML expertise — specifically, a Derivatives-Native premium of $25K-$40K."

**3. The "High-Probability AI" Lever**
> "Tastytrade's high-probability trading philosophy is the perfect foundation for ML-driven strategy optimization. I can build models that identify optimal options strategies based on implied volatility rank, market regime, and portfolio Greeks — codifying Tom Sosnoff's probabilistic trading approach into AI systems that scale to millions of traders. This is a high-impact, derivatives-native ML application that directly extends Tastytrade's core value proposition. I'd like my compensation to include an AI innovation premium alongside the Derivatives-Native bonus."

**4. The "Chicago Quant-ML Market" Lever**
> "Chicago is the epicenter of quantitative trading — and the competition for ML engineers with derivatives expertise is fierce. Citadel, Jump Trading, DRW, and Tastytrade all compete for the same small pool of ML engineers who understand both deep learning and derivatives mathematics. I'm seeing ML comp packages of $300K-$380K+ at Chicago quant firms. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to be competitive at $330K-$362K TC, reflecting the premium for derivatives-native ML engineering."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** ML/AI Engineers at Tastytrade sit at the intersection of two scarce skill sets — machine learning engineering and derivatives quantitative expertise — and compensation should reflect the multiplicative scarcity. In **Chicago**, target $330K-$362K TC by anchoring on Citadel Securities, Jump Trading, and DRW quantitative researcher compensation — these are the true comparable roles for derivatives-native ML engineers, not generic fintech ML positions. In **New York**, push for $360K-$398K TC by combining the geographic premium with institutional AI applications relevant to IG Group's New York presence. In **London**, negotiate dual-currency at £245K-£276K / $306K-$345K TC — IG Group HQ needs ML/AI engineers who can build cross-asset AI models spanning Tastytrade's options data and IG's global FX/CFD data. The strongest lever is demonstrating that your ML expertise is specifically tuned for derivatives markets — show models you've built for volatility prediction, strategy optimization, or flow analysis that account for the unique statistical properties of options data. This combination is what justifies the Derivatives-Native premium at the ML/AI level.
