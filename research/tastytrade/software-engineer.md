#### Compensation Benchmarks — 3-Region Model

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chicago (HQ) | $115K - $155K | $20K - $35K/yr | $17K - $28K | $152K - $218K |
| New York | $127K - $170K | $22K - $38K/yr | $19K - $31K | $168K - $239K |
| London | £88K - £118K / $110K - $148K | £16K - £27K/yr / $20K - $34K/yr | £13K - £21K / $16K - $26K | £117K - £166K / $146K - $208K |

*Compensation includes IG Group equity (LSE: IGG). RSUs vest over 4 years. Derivatives-Native bonuses are additive for engineers with options/derivatives domain expertise.*

#### Negotiation DNA

Tastytrade is not a general-purpose brokerage — it is a derivatives-first platform built by options traders for options traders. Co-founded by Tom Sosnoff and Tony Battista, the company was purpose-built around high-probability trading strategies, and its engineering culture reflects that DNA. As a Software Engineer at Tastytrade, you are not building generic CRUD applications — you are building real-time systems that compute Greeks, render vol surfaces, and execute multi-leg options strategies with sub-millisecond precision. This specialization is your negotiation superpower.

Since IG Group's $1B acquisition of Tastytrade in 2021, the integration of IG's global FX, CFD, and spread betting capabilities with Tastytrade's options-native platform has created unprecedented engineering complexity. Software Engineers working on this integration layer — bridging Chicago's derivatives expertise with London's global markets infrastructure — are handling problems that most fintech engineers never encounter. Your compensation should reflect the rarity of this skillset.

The "Options Alpha" premium is real and quantifiable. Engineers who can speak fluently about delta-neutral hedging, implied volatility skew, and options chain optimization are dramatically scarcer than general backend or frontend engineers. When you negotiate at Tastytrade, you are not competing against the general SWE talent pool — you are competing against the tiny subset of engineers who understand both distributed systems AND derivatives mathematics.

#### Options Alpha — The Derivatives-Native Premium

This is the single most important lever in your Tastytrade negotiation. Tastytrade's entire value proposition rests on its derivatives-native platform, and engineers who bring options/derivatives domain expertise command a measurable premium above standard fintech compensation.

- **The Derivatives-Native Bonus (8-15% above standard fintech):** Engineers who demonstrate fluency in options pricing models (Black-Scholes, binomial trees), Greeks computation (delta, gamma, theta, vega, rho), and vol surface construction can command a Derivatives-Native bonus of $12K-$33K above standard Software Engineer compensation at comparable fintech firms. This bonus reflects the scarcity of engineers who combine systems engineering with quantitative finance domain knowledge. At the SWE level, this typically manifests as a $12K-$20K uplift on base salary and a $5K-$13K uplift on annual bonus.

- **High-Probability Trading Focus:** Tastytrade's platform is built around high-probability options strategies — selling premium, managing portfolio Greeks, and optimizing probability of profit. Engineers must understand these concepts to build effective UIs, risk engines, and analytics dashboards. Candidates who can articulate how they would optimize the rendering of a multi-leg options position's P&L curve or implement real-time Greeks aggregation across a portfolio are demonstrating Derivatives-Native value that justifies premium compensation.

- **IG Group Global Integration:** Since the $1B acquisition, Tastytrade engineers increasingly work on integration points with IG Group's global platform. This means exposure to FX options, CFD pricing, and cross-border regulatory compliance — all of which are derivatives-adjacent and compound the Derivatives-Native premium. Engineers who can navigate both Tastytrade's options-centric architecture and IG Group's multi-asset global infrastructure are exceptionally rare.

- **tastylive Media Network Synergy:** Tastytrade's tastylive media network produces financial content consumed by millions of retail traders. Engineers who understand how trading concepts translate into educational content and platform features — who can build systems that connect live market analysis with actionable trading tools — add a content-platform integration dimension that further justifies Derivatives-Native premium compensation.

#### Global Levers

**1. The "Options-Native Scarcity" Lever**
> "I want to be transparent about my market position. I have experience building systems that handle real-time options pricing, Greeks computation, and multi-leg strategy execution. Engineers with this derivatives-native background are significantly scarcer than general full-stack engineers — I've seen competing offers from [IBKR/CME/CBOE] that reflect a 10-15% premium for this domain expertise. I'd like my Tastytrade offer to reflect the Derivatives-Native value I bring to your options-first platform."

**2. The "IG Group Global Integration" Lever**
> "With IG Group's global footprint now integrating with Tastytrade's platform, I understand the engineering challenges span multiple asset classes, regulatory regimes, and time zones. My ability to work across derivatives products — options, FX, CFDs — positions me to contribute to integration workstreams that are critical to the combined entity's strategy. I'd like to discuss how my compensation reflects the cross-platform complexity of this role."

**3. The "Chicago Hub Cost-of-Opportunity" Lever**
> "While Chicago's cost of living is below New York or San Francisco, I want to make sure we're benchmarking my compensation against the derivatives engineering talent market — which is concentrated in Chicago (CBOE, CME, Citadel) and commands premium comp regardless of geography. I'm seeing total comp packages of $165K-$210K for SWE roles at Chicago derivatives firms, and I'd like my Tastytrade offer to be competitive within that specific talent pool."

**4. The "High-Probability Trading Platform" Lever**
> "Tastytrade's differentiation is its focus on high-probability trading strategies — selling premium, managing risk through Greeks, and optimizing for probability of profit. Building software that makes these strategies accessible to retail traders requires deep domain understanding that goes far beyond typical fintech engineering. I'd like to discuss a Derivatives-Native bonus component that reflects this specialized value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target the upper quartile of each region's range by stacking the Derivatives-Native premium with competing offers from Chicago derivatives firms. In **Chicago**, push for $190K-$218K TC by anchoring on CME Group and CBOE competing offers. In **New York**, target $210K-$239K TC by referencing the 10% geographic premium plus derivatives scarcity. In **London**, negotiate in GBP but reference USD-equivalent comp at IG Group HQ — target £145K-£166K / $182K-$208K TC by leveraging IG Group's need for derivatives-native engineers who can bridge Tastytrade and IG platforms. Always lead with the Derivatives-Native bonus as an additive component — frame it as a specialized market premium, not a general raise request.
