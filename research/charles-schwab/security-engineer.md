#### Negotiation DNA

The Security Engineer at Charles Schwab protects $8.5 trillion in client assets from the most sophisticated threat actors in the world: nation-state hackers, organized cybercrime syndicates, insider threats, and increasingly, adversarial AI attacks. This is not hypothetical risk -- Schwab is one of the highest-value targets in the global financial system. A successful breach could compromise the financial security of 35 million Americans. Your negotiation leverage is rooted in the existential nature of your role: Schwab cannot afford to underpay for the engineers who stand between its clients and catastrophic financial loss.

The Feb 10, 2026 Sputnik Moment introduced an entirely new attack surface at Schwab. As the firm accelerates its deployment of AI-powered advisor tools, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, and AI-driven client interactions, each of these systems becomes a new vector for adversarial manipulation. AI model poisoning, prompt injection attacks on advisor-facing chatbots, and manipulation of algorithmic recommendations could all be weaponized to erode advisor trust or redirect client wealth. Security Engineers are now Guardians of Human-AI Wealth in the most literal defensive sense: you protect the AI systems that protect the advisor-client relationship.

Your competitive landscape includes security roles at financial institutions (Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citadel), Big Tech (Google, Microsoft, Amazon), and government (NSA, CISA). Schwab's unique value is the combination of financial cybersecurity mission criticality, AI security challenges, and public equity compensation certainty.

#### Sputnik Moment — The Guardians of Human-AI Wealth Premium

- **The Feb 10, 2026 Shock:** The February 10, 2026 market selloff accelerated Schwab's AI deployment timeline -- and with it, dramatically expanded the firm's AI attack surface. Security Engineers were immediately tasked with securing a new generation of AI-powered financial systems: advisor recommendation engines, client-facing chatbots, portfolio optimization algorithms, and AI-driven risk assessment tools. Each of these systems is vulnerable to adversarial AI attacks that could manipulate financial advice, compromise client data, or undermine advisor trust. Post-Sputnik Moment, AI security is not optional -- it is existential.

- **The Advisor Protection Premium:** At the Security Engineer level, the Advisor Protection premium is worth $22K-$45K in additional total compensation. This reflects the unique security challenge of protecting AI systems in a fiduciary context: a compromised recommendation engine does not just leak data -- it potentially misdirects client wealth. Security Engineers who understand the intersection of AI security, financial regulation, and advisor trust are in extremely short supply, which creates significant compensation leverage.

- **Guardian Defense Architecture:** Post-Sputnik Moment, Schwab requires all AI systems to meet a "Guardian security standard" -- meaning AI systems must be protected against adversarial inputs, model manipulation, data poisoning, and prompt injection attacks that could compromise advisor recommendations or client interactions. Security Engineers who can design and implement this Guardian defense architecture are worth a 12-16% premium, approximately $25K-$48K, because they protect the trust that underpins $8.5 trillion in client assets.

- **Concrete Dollar Impact:** A Security Engineer who positions themselves as a Guardian of Human-AI Wealth should target the $268K-$298K range in Westlake, TX. In San Francisco, target $295K-$328K. Use this framing: *"I protect AI systems against adversarial attacks in high-stakes financial environments. My experience with [AI security / adversarial ML defense / financial cybersecurity] means I understand the unique threat landscape facing Schwab's advisor AI platforms -- where a security failure is not just a data breach, but a breach of fiduciary trust."*

#### Global Levers

1. **Financial Cybersecurity Lever ($12K-$25K):** SEC/FINRA-regulated security experience commands a premium: *"I've designed and implemented security architectures for financial systems under SEC/FINRA regulatory scrutiny, including penetration testing, incident response, and compliance-driven security monitoring. At Schwab, this means I understand the regulatory security requirements that make financial cybersecurity fundamentally different from general-purpose security."*

2. **AI/ML Security Lever ($18K-$35K):** Post-Sputnik Moment, AI security is the highest-value security lever: *"I've secured AI/ML systems against adversarial attacks, including model poisoning, data contamination, prompt injection, and adversarial inputs. At Schwab, this means I can protect the advisor AI platforms that are central to the firm's post-Sputnik Moment strategy -- ensuring that AI recommendations cannot be manipulated by malicious actors."*

3. **Threat Intelligence & Incident Response Lever ($10K-$22K):** Schwab faces sophisticated threats requiring advanced defensive capabilities: *"I've built and led threat intelligence and incident response programs protecting [X in assets / Y users / Z systems]. I understand the threat landscape facing large financial institutions and have the incident response muscle memory to protect Schwab's $8.5 trillion in client assets."*

4. **Zero Trust Architecture Lever ($8K-$18K):** Schwab's post-merger architecture requires modern security patterns: *"I've designed and implemented zero trust security architectures across [X] environments, including identity-based access controls, micro-segmentation, and continuous verification. At Schwab, where the TD Ameritrade integration has created a complex multi-environment landscape, zero trust architecture is essential for protecting client wealth."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $275K TC for Westlake, TX (upper-third of the $205K-$298K range). Open your counter at $292K, citing your AI security expertise and financial cybersecurity credentials. Your walk-away floor should be $232K in Westlake, $248K in Denver, and $260K in San Francisco. Push for a $22K-$32K signing bonus and consider negotiating for a security clearance stipend if applicable. Structure your counter: *"My experience securing AI systems in financial environments makes me a Guardian of Human-AI Wealth at Schwab. I understand that AI security in wealth management is not just about protecting data -- it is about protecting the trust between advisors and clients that underpins $8.5 trillion in assets. I'd like to close at $292K TC with a $28K signing bonus, reflecting the Advisor Protection security premium."* If Schwab counters below $250K in TX, negotiate for a Senior Security Engineer title with ownership of the AI security program and a guaranteed RSU refresh at 12 months.
