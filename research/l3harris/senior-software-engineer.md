### Senior Software Engineer | L3Harris Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Traditional Defense Compensation + Stability Premium | $45B Market Cap | Defense Electronics/Communications | Standard 40-45 Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Melbourne, FL | $130K-$175K | $30K-$90K | 10% | $155K-$235K |
| Salt Lake City, UT | $125K-$170K | $30K-$90K | 10% | $150K-$230K |
| Rochester, NY | $125K-$170K | $28K-$85K | 10% | $148K-$225K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at L3Harris own critical embedded software subsystems for defense electronics products. You're the technical lead on electronic warfare software, tactical radio firmware, ISR processing algorithms, or satellite communication protocol stacks. At Senior level, you're expected to mentor junior engineers, lead technical reviews, and make architectural decisions within your subsystem. L3Harris Senior SWEs who have security clearances and embedded systems expertise are in high demand across the defense industry -- Northrop, Raytheon, and BAE all actively recruit L3Harris engineers. Use competing defense offers as leverage. L3Harris will typically match or beat defense peer offers to retain cleared, experienced engineers. [Source: L3Harris Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris Senior SWE = Raytheon Senior SWE = Northrop Senior SWE -- L3Harris pays 5-10% above defense median for cleared embedded engineers

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Cleared Engineer Retention:** "As a cleared Senior SWE, I'm actively recruited by every defense prime. L3Harris should price my compensation to prevent poaching."
- **Subsystem Ownership:** "I own critical defense subsystems. Replacing me takes 6-12 months of recruiting plus clearance processing. My retention value is high."
- **Long-Term Career Investment:** "I'm choosing L3Harris for the long-term career path. The starting compensation should reflect my commitment and expertise."

**Global Levers**

1. **Cleared Engineer Scarcity:** "Cleared Senior SWEs with embedded defense experience are among the scarcest technical talent in the market."
2. **Defense Industry Leverage:** "Northrop, Raytheon, and BAE actively recruit L3Harris Senior SWEs. I have competing defense offers to reference."
3. **Subsystem Ownership Value:** "Replacing a cleared Senior SWE costs 6-12 months and $100K+ in recruiting. My retention is worth investment."
4. **Electronic Warfare Software:** "EW software expertise is critical to L3Harris's core business and extremely rare outside of defense."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a cleared Senior SWE with embedded defense experience -- the scarcest talent in the defense market. Northrop and Raytheon are actively recruiting me at $165K base. I want L3Harris's stability and mission, but the base needs to match or beat defense peer offers. I'm targeting $170K base, $85K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus." Accept at $160K+ base with $75K+ RSU.
