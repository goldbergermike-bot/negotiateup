| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Melbourne, FL | $105K-$155K | $20K-$70K | 10% | $125K-$200K |
| Salt Lake City, UT | $100K-$150K | $20K-$70K | 10% | $120K-$195K |

**Negotiation DNA**

L3Harris is the world's leading defense electronics company with a $45B market cap. SWEs at L3Harris build embedded software for electronic warfare systems, tactical communication networks, ISR sensor processing, and satellite communication payloads. Unlike FAANG software engineering, L3Harris SWE involves significant hardware-software integration -- your code runs on custom embedded systems, FPGAs, and real-time processors in defense equipment. The culture is traditional defense: 40-45 hour weeks, 10% annual bonus, RSUs, strong 401k matching (up to 6%), pension for some positions, and stable long-term employment. Total comp is significantly below FAANG ($125K-$200K vs. $200K-$350K) but the work-life balance, job stability, and retirement benefits are dramatically better. L3Harris's Florida locations offer low cost of living and no state income tax. [Source: L3Harris SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris SWE = Raytheon SWE = Northrop SWE -- L3Harris typically pays at or slightly above defense industry median

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **40-45 Hour Standard:** "L3Harris's 40-45 hour culture is a massive quality-of-life advantage over SpaceX (60+) or FAANG (50+). I'm accepting lower TC for better life balance."
- **Florida Tax Advantage:** "No state income tax in Florida. My $140K base in Melbourne, FL has the purchasing power of $160K+ in California after state taxes."
- **Retirement Benefits:** "L3Harris's 401k matching (up to 6%) and potential pension add $10K-$20K/year in retirement value not captured in total comp."

**Global Levers**

1. **Defense Electronics Leader:** "L3Harris is #1 in defense electronics. I'm joining the most stable, specialized defense company in the market."
2. **Embedded Software Scarcity:** "SWEs who can write embedded C/C++ for real-time defense systems are scarcer than web developers. My hardware-software skills command a premium."
3. **Work-Life Comp Tradeoff:** "I'm choosing stability and balance, but I should still be at the top of L3Harris's band. Maximize base within the range."
4. **Clearance Value:** "My clearance (or willingness to obtain one) makes me 20-30% more valuable in defense. This should be reflected in starting compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm an embedded SWE with defense-relevant skills -- hardware-software integration, real-time systems, and security clearance eligibility. Within L3Harris's compensation structure, I should be at the top of band. I'm targeting $150K base, $65K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing offer from [Northrop/Raytheon/BAE] is at $145K base. The Florida tax advantage is real, but the base should still reflect my embedded systems expertise." Accept at $140K+ base with $55K+ RSU.
