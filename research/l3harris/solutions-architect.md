**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at L3Harris design how defense electronics integrate into customer systems. You architect communications network deployments for military branches, design ISR sensor integration for specific platforms (aircraft, ships, ground vehicles), and create electronic warfare system architectures for DOD customers. SAs are the technical bridge between L3Harris engineering and military customers -- your architecture proposals are often the deciding factor in contract competitions. L3Harris SAs travel 30-50% to military installations and defense exhibitions. The DC location often commands higher comp due to proximity to DOD customers and the concentration of defense industry talent. [Source: L3Harris SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris SA = Raytheon SA = Northrop Systems Architect -- customer-facing technical roles in defense

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Revenue-Generating Technical Role:** "My architectures directly win contracts. Each proposal I support is a $50M-$1B revenue opportunity."
- **Customer Technical Authority:** "I represent L3Harris's technical capability to military customers. My credibility directly impacts win rates."
- **Travel Compensation:** "30-50% travel to military installations. The travel burden deserves recognition in compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **Contract-Winning Architecture:** "My technical proposals directly win or lose $50M-$1B programs. I'm a revenue generator."
2. **Customer Relationship Value:** "My relationships with DOD technical evaluators influence procurement decisions. These relationships take years to build."
3. **Defense Integration Expertise:** "Architecting how defense electronics integrate into military platforms is rare expertise."
4. **DC Location Premium:** "Washington DC proximity to DOD customers and defense industry makes DC-based SAs more valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "My architectures directly win $50M-$1B defense contracts. I represent L3Harris's technical capability to DOD customers. I'm targeting $170K base, $82K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing SA offer from [Northrop/Raytheon] is at $165K base. Customer-facing technical roles deserve top-of-band compensation." Accept at $160K+ base with $70K+ RSU.
