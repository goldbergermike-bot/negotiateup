**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at L3Harris build data infrastructure for defense systems -- processing sensor data from ISR platforms, managing signals intelligence databases, building data pipelines for electronic warfare analysis, and enabling data-driven decision-making across defense programs. L3Harris's data engineering work involves both classified and unclassified environments, with significant work on multi-source intelligence data fusion. The data domain is defense-specific: radar returns, electronic order of battle, SIGINT intercepts, and geospatial intelligence. L3Harris is investing in modernizing its data infrastructure -- moving from legacy systems to modern data platforms -- creating opportunities for data engineers to have outsized impact.

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris DE = Raytheon DE = Northrop DE -- defense data engineering is a growing capability across all primes

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Data Modernization Impact:** "L3Harris is modernizing data infrastructure. I'm building modern data platforms to replace decades-old legacy systems."
- **Defense Data Expertise:** "ISR data processing, SIGINT analysis, and multi-source intelligence fusion are specialized data engineering domains."
- **Cleared Data Engineer Scarcity:** "Cleared data engineers are extremely rare. Most DEs work at cloud companies without clearances."

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Modernization Initiative:** "I'm modernizing L3Harris's data infrastructure -- replacing legacy systems with modern platforms. This transformation drives competitive advantage."
2. **Defense Data Domain:** "ISR, SIGINT, and intelligence data engineering are specialized domains that commercial DEs don't understand."
3. **Cleared DE Premium:** "Cleared data engineers are scarce. My clearance and defense data skills command a market premium."
4. **Defense Peer Leverage:** "Data engineers with clearances are recruited across all primes. [Northrop/Raytheon/Palantir] are competing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a cleared data engineer modernizing L3Harris's data infrastructure -- replacing legacy systems with modern platforms. Cleared DEs are scarce, and defense tech companies are offering 2x compensation. I'm targeting $155K base, $68K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing offer from [Northrop/Raytheon] is at $150K base." Accept at $145K+ base with $58K+ RSU.
