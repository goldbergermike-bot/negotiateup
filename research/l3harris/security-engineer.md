### Security Engineer | L3Harris Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Traditional Defense Compensation + Clearance Premium | $45B Market Cap | Defense Security/CMMC/Classified Systems | Standard 40-45 Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Melbourne, FL | $115K-$165K | $24K-$78K | 10% | $138K-$218K |
| Salt Lake City, UT | $110K-$160K | $24K-$78K | 10% | $133K-$213K |
| Rochester, NY | $110K-$160K | $22K-$75K | 10% | $131K-$210K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at L3Harris protect defense electronics systems, classified development environments, and sensitive defense data. You manage CMMC compliance across L3Harris facilities, secure classified development networks (SIPR, JWICS), protect defense electronics against supply chain threats, and ensure product security for systems deployed to military customers. L3Harris handles data across all classification levels, and security engineers must maintain compliance with NIST 800-171, CMMC, ITAR, and customer-specific security requirements. The cybersecurity talent gap in defense is acute -- cleared security engineers are recruited aggressively by every defense prime and increasingly by defense tech startups.

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris Security Eng = Raytheon Cyber Eng = Northrop Security Eng -- defense security is distinct from commercial cybersecurity

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Multi-Classification Security:** "I manage security across unclassified, CUI, Secret, and TS/SCI environments. Multi-classification compliance is extraordinarily complex."
- **CMMC Compliance Expertise:** "CMMC compliance is mandatory for all defense contractors. My CMMC expertise directly determines L3Harris's ability to bid on contracts."
- **Supply Chain Security:** "I protect against hardware and software supply chain threats -- a growing national security priority."

**Global Levers**

1. **CMMC Compliance = Contract Eligibility:** "Without CMMC compliance, L3Harris can't bid on contracts. My work directly enables billions in revenue."
2. **Multi-Classification Expertise:** "Managing security across multiple classification levels is rare and complex."
3. **Cleared Security Engineer Scarcity:** "Cleared security engineers are among the most aggressively recruited talent in defense."
4. **Supply Chain Security Priority:** "Hardware/software supply chain security is a national priority. My expertise is increasingly valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage security compliance across multiple classification levels -- work that directly determines L3Harris's ability to bid on contracts worth billions. Cleared security engineers are the most aggressively recruited talent in defense. I'm targeting $160K base, $74K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing offer from [Northrop/CrowdStrike] is at $155K base." Accept at $150K+ base with $62K+ RSU.
