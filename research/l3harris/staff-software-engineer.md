**Negotiation DNA**

Staff SWEs at L3Harris (often called "Principal Engineers" or "Technical Fellows-in-training") are the most senior technical leaders in the software organization. You set architecture and technical standards across multiple programs, influence technology investment decisions, and represent L3Harris's technical capability to DOD customers during proposal reviews. At Staff level, you've typically been in defense for 10+ years with deep domain expertise in electronic warfare, communications, or ISR systems. L3Harris Staff engineers are heavily recruited by defense startups (Anduril, Shield AI) at 2-3x the compensation -- use this as leverage while emphasizing your preference for L3Harris's stability and mission.

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris Staff/Principal SWE = Raytheon Principal Eng = Northrop Technical Fellow -- top of individual contributor technical track

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Defense Startup Counter-Offers:** "Anduril and Shield AI are actively recruiting cleared Staff engineers at $350K-$450K total comp. I prefer L3Harris's stability, but the gap is significant."
- **Technical Authority Value:** "As a Staff engineer, my architectural decisions span multiple programs worth $500M+. My technical authority directly impacts program success."
- **Institutional Knowledge:** "My 10+ years of defense domain expertise and customer relationships are irreplaceable. Losing me costs L3Harris years of institutional knowledge."

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Program Architecture:** "My technical decisions span multiple programs worth hundreds of millions. This architectural authority is worth top-of-band compensation."
2. **Defense Startup Leverage:** "Anduril/Shield AI are offering $350K+ to cleared Staff engineers. L3Harris's stability is worth something, but not a 50% discount."
3. **Customer Technical Authority:** "I represent L3Harris's technical capability to DOD customers. My credibility directly wins proposals."
4. **Institutional Knowledge Premium:** "Replacing my domain expertise and customer relationships takes 5+ years. This knowledge has immense retention value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a Staff-level cleared engineer with multi-program architectural authority and deep customer relationships. Defense startups are offering $350K-$450K, and I prefer L3Harris's stability -- but the base and RSU need to reflect my value. I'm targeting $195K base, $110K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. The gap between L3Harris and defense tech is already large -- it shouldn't be larger than necessary." Accept at $180K+ base with $95K+ RSU.
