**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at L3Harris manage build, test, and deployment infrastructure for defense embedded software. This is fundamentally different from cloud DevOps: you manage CI/CD pipelines for real-time embedded systems, cross-compilation environments for custom hardware, and classified network infrastructure. L3Harris DevOps spans development environments on classified networks (SIPR, JWICS), embedded software build systems for FPGAs and real-time processors, and hardware-in-the-loop test infrastructure. L3Harris is modernizing its DevOps practices -- adopting containers, infrastructure-as-code, and automated testing in environments where cloud tools don't work (air-gapped, classified). DevOps modernization is a strategic priority. [Source: L3Harris DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris DevOps = Raytheon DevSecOps = Northrop Infrastructure Eng -- defense DevOps is a distinct and growing discipline

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Classified Infrastructure Management:** "I manage development infrastructure on classified networks. This requires clearance and specialized skills that cloud DevOps engineers don't have."
- **DevOps Modernization:** "L3Harris is modernizing build and deployment practices. My work transforms how the company develops defense software."
- **Embedded CI/CD Expertise:** "CI/CD for embedded real-time systems on custom hardware is fundamentally different from cloud-native DevOps."

**Global Levers**

1. **Classified DevOps Scarcity:** "DevOps engineers who can work on classified networks with embedded systems are extremely rare."
2. **Modernization Impact:** "My DevOps modernization work accelerates development velocity across multiple programs worth hundreds of millions."
3. **Embedded Build Expertise:** "Cross-compilation, hardware-in-the-loop testing, and FPGA build infrastructure are unique to defense DevOps."
4. **Defense Peer Leverage:** "Classified DevOps engineers are recruited across all primes and by defense startups."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage classified DevOps infrastructure for embedded defense systems -- skills that don't exist in commercial tech. My modernization work accelerates development across multiple programs. I'm targeting $150K base, $65K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing offer from [Northrop/Raytheon] is at $145K base." Accept at $140K+ base with $55K+ RSU.
