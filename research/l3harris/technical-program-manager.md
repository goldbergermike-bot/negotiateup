### Technical Program Manager | L3Harris Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Traditional Defense Compensation + Program Delivery Premium | $45B Market Cap | Defense Program Execution | Standard 40-45 Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Melbourne, FL | $120K-$170K | $25K-$80K | 10% | $145K-$225K |
| Salt Lake City, UT | $115K-$165K | $25K-$80K | 10% | $140K-$220K |
| Rochester, NY | $115K-$165K | $23K-$75K | 10% | $138K-$215K |

**Negotiation DNA**

TPMs at L3Harris manage defense electronics programs through the full lifecycle: proposal, design, development, integration, test, production, and fielding. L3Harris programs span electronic warfare systems, tactical communication networks, ISR sensor payloads, and satellite communication systems. TPMs coordinate across hardware design, embedded software development, systems engineering, manufacturing, and quality assurance. Defense program management follows structured processes (Earned Value Management, EVMS milestones, CDR/PDR reviews) with DOD oversight at every stage. Each program has firm fixed-price or cost-plus contracts with specific delivery milestones -- missed milestones result in financial penalties and damaged customer relationships.

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris TPM = Raytheon Program Manager = Northrop TPM -- defense TPM includes EVM, contract management, and DOD oversight

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Program P&L Accountability:** "I manage program budgets of $50M-$500M with EVM reporting. My financial management directly impacts L3Harris profitability."
- **Full Lifecycle Management:** "I manage from proposal through fielding -- a 3-5 year lifecycle that requires sustained program leadership."
- **DOD Customer Management:** "I interface directly with DOD program offices. My customer management skills drive contract performance ratings."

**Global Levers**

1. **Program Financial Accountability:** "I manage $50M-$500M program budgets with full EVM accountability. Financial performance directly impacts L3Harris profitability."
2. **Customer Performance Ratings:** "My program execution drives CPARS ratings, which determine future contract awards. Good ratings win follow-on business."
3. **Full Lifecycle Management:** "Proposal-to-fielding program management across hardware and software is a rare and valuable skill."
4. **Defense Peer Leverage:** "Program managers with defense lifecycle experience are actively recruited across primes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage $50M-$500M defense programs with full P&L accountability. My program execution drives customer ratings that determine billions in follow-on contracts. I'm targeting $165K base, $75K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing TPM offer from [Northrop/Raytheon] is at $160K base." Accept at $155K+ base with $65K+ RSU.
