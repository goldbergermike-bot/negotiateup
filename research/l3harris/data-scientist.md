### Data Scientist | L3Harris Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Traditional Defense Compensation + Stability Premium | $45B Market Cap | Defense Analytics/ISR Intelligence | Standard 40-45 Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Melbourne, FL | $110K-$160K | $22K-$72K | 10% | $132K-$205K |
| Salt Lake City, UT | $105K-$155K | $22K-$72K | 10% | $127K-$200K |
| Rochester, NY | $105K-$155K | $20K-$68K | 10% | $125K-$195K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at L3Harris work on defense analytics: signal processing analysis, electronic warfare effectiveness modeling, ISR sensor performance optimization, and intelligence data pattern recognition. Your models analyze radar signatures, communication intercepts, and multi-source intelligence to detect threats, characterize adversary systems, and optimize L3Harris sensor performance. The analytics domain is deeply specialized -- electromagnetic spectrum analysis, acoustic signal processing, and geospatial intelligence are skills that don't exist in commercial data science. L3Harris is increasing AI/ML investment across its defense products, creating growing demand for data scientists who understand both modern ML techniques and defense-specific data domains.

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris DS = Raytheon DS = Northrop DS -- defense data science is growing across primes, with L3Harris investing heavily

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Defense Analytics Specialization:** "Electromagnetic spectrum analysis and signal processing data science are specialized domains with very few practitioners."
- **AI/ML Investment Growth:** "L3Harris is increasing AI/ML investment across products. My data science work directly improves product capability and competitiveness."
- **Cleared DS Scarcity:** "Cleared data scientists willing to work in defense are scarce. Most DS talent goes to FAANG or AI startups."

**Global Levers**

1. **Signal Processing Analytics:** "I analyze radar, SIGINT, and EW data -- specialized analytics that commercial data scientists can't do."
2. **AI/ML Product Integration:** "My models are being integrated into L3Harris products. AI-enhanced defense electronics are the future competitive advantage."
3. **Cleared DS Premium:** "Cleared data scientists are among the scarcest talent in the market."
4. **Defense Tech Competition:** "Palantir, Anduril, and defense startups are recruiting cleared DSs at 2x compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a cleared data scientist specializing in signal processing analytics and defense AI/ML -- skills at the intersection of L3Harris's core competency and future growth. Defense tech companies are offering 2x. I'm targeting $155K base, $68K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing offer from [Northrop/Palantir] is at $150K base." Accept at $145K+ base with $58K+ RSU.
