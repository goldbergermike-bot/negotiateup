### Product Designer | L3Harris Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Traditional Defense Compensation + Stability Premium | $45B Market Cap | Defense Electronics Interface Design | Standard 40-45 Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Melbourne, FL | $100K-$145K | $15K-$55K | 10% | $118K-$180K |
| Salt Lake City, UT | $95K-$140K | $15K-$55K | 10% | $113K-$175K |
| Rochester, NY | $95K-$140K | $14K-$52K | 10% | $112K-$172K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at L3Harris design interfaces for defense electronics systems -- tactical radio displays, electronic warfare operator consoles, ISR analysis workstations, and satellite ground station interfaces. Defense design is fundamentally different from consumer UX: your users are military operators who have been trained on specific interaction patterns, your designs must meet military human factors standards (MIL-STD-1472), and your interfaces must work in extreme conditions (bright sun, night vision, vibration, G-forces). The design team at L3Harris is small relative to the engineering organization, giving each designer significant influence. L3Harris is investing in modernizing operator interfaces -- moving from legacy green-screen displays to modern, touch-enabled tactical interfaces. [Source: L3Harris Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris Product Designer = Raytheon UX = Northrop HMI Designer -- defense UI/UX is a distinct discipline from consumer design

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Military Human Factors Expertise:** "I design to MIL-STD-1472 and defense human factors standards. This specialized UX knowledge doesn't exist in consumer tech."
- **Interface Modernization Initiative:** "L3Harris is modernizing legacy interfaces. My design work directly improves product competitiveness and user satisfaction."
- **Small Design Team Impact:** "As one of few designers, my work touches every major product. Per-designer impact is very high."

**Global Levers**

1. **Defense UX Specialization:** "Military human factors design expertise is rare. Few designers understand MIL-STD-1472, night vision compatibility, and tactical interface design."
2. **Interface Modernization Value:** "Modern interfaces are a competitive differentiator. My design work directly improves L3Harris's product win rate."
3. **Per-Designer Impact:** "Each designer at L3Harris has outsized product impact. My designs reach across multiple defense programs."
4. **Defense Peer Leverage:** "Defense UX designers are recruited across primes. I have market data from [Northrop/Raytheon/BAE]."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I design tactical interfaces meeting military human factors standards -- specialized UX expertise that doesn't exist in consumer tech. L3Harris's interface modernization initiative makes my work a competitive differentiator. I'm targeting $140K base, $50K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing offer from [Northrop/Raytheon] is at $135K base." Accept at $130K+ base with $40K+ RSU.
