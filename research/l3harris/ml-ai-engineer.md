### ML/AI Engineer | L3Harris Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Traditional Defense Compensation + Tech Premium | $45B Market Cap | Defense AI/Sensor Processing/EW | Standard 40-45 Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Melbourne, FL | $125K-$175K | $28K-$85K | 10% | $150K-$235K |
| Salt Lake City, UT | $120K-$170K | $28K-$85K | 10% | $145K-$230K |
| Rochester, NY | $120K-$170K | $26K-$80K | 10% | $143K-$225K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at L3Harris apply machine learning to defense electronics: automatic target recognition from sensor data, AI-enhanced electronic warfare, intelligent signal processing, and autonomous sensor management. This is ML deployment on embedded hardware in defense systems -- your models run on FPGAs, GPUs, and custom processors inside tactical equipment, not cloud servers. L3Harris is investing heavily in AI-enhanced defense electronics as the DOD pushes for more autonomous, AI-powered systems. ML engineers with defense clearances who can deploy models to embedded hardware are among the scarcest and most valuable talent in the industry. L3Harris pays a 10-15% premium over standard defense SWE for ML/AI roles, reflecting the talent competition with tech companies and AI startups. [Source: L3Harris ML Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris ML/AI Eng = Raytheon ML Eng = Northrop AI Eng -- L3Harris pays 10-15% above defense SWE base for ML roles

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **ML + Embedded Deployment:** "I deploy ML models on embedded defense hardware. This requires both ML expertise and embedded systems knowledge -- an extraordinarily rare combination."
- **AI Investment Growth:** "L3Harris is dramatically increasing AI investment. I'm at the forefront of the most important technology shift in defense electronics."
- **Massive ML Talent Gap:** "Cleared ML engineers are the scarcest talent in defense. FAANG and AI startups offer 2-3x compensation for ML talent."

**Global Levers**

1. **Embedded ML Scarcity:** "ML engineers who can deploy models on embedded defense hardware are the rarest talent in the defense industry."
2. **AI Defense Investment:** "DOD AI spending is growing 25%+ annually. L3Harris's AI-enhanced products are the future of defense electronics."
3. **Cleared ML Premium:** "Cleared ML engineers are recruited by every defense company and defense tech startup. I have maximum market leverage."
4. **FAANG/AI Startup Competition:** "My competing offers from [FAANG/OpenAI/Anthropic] are 2-3x L3Harris total comp. The defense stability premium should not be a 60% discount."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a cleared ML engineer deploying models on embedded defense hardware -- the scarcest talent combination in the industry. FAANG and AI startups are offering $300K-$400K. I'm choosing defense for the mission and stability, but L3Harris must maximize compensation within its structure. I'm targeting $170K base, $80K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing defense AI offer from [Northrop/Palantir] is at $165K base." Accept at $160K+ base with $70K+ RSU.
