**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at L3Harris lead teams building defense electronics systems -- electronic warfare, tactical communications, ISR sensors, and satellite payloads. L3Harris EMs manage teams of 10-25 engineers with a focus on program execution, technical quality, and personnel development. Unlike startup EMs, L3Harris EMs operate within a mature organizational structure with defined processes, career ladders, and program management frameworks. The role balances people management with program delivery -- you're responsible for both team development and on-time, on-budget delivery of defense programs worth $50M-$500M. L3Harris EMs receive 10-15% bonus (higher than IC 10%), reflecting management responsibility. The management career path leads to Director, VP, and SVP positions.

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris EM = Raytheon EM = Northrop EM -- L3Harris pays competitively with defense peers for management

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Program Delivery Accountability:** "I'm accountable for on-time, on-budget delivery of defense programs worth $50M-$500M. This P&L responsibility justifies top-of-band compensation."
- **Team Retention Challenge:** "Defense startups are recruiting my engineers at 2x compensation. My ability to retain cleared technical talent saves L3Harris millions in replacement costs."
- **Management Career Path:** "I'm choosing L3Harris's management career path (Director, VP, SVP). The starting EM compensation sets the foundation for my long-term career here."

**Global Levers**

1. **Program Delivery Accountability:** "I deliver defense programs worth $50M-$500M on time and on budget. My execution directly impacts L3Harris revenue and customer relationships."
2. **Cleared Team Retention:** "Retaining cleared engineers against startup poaching is my biggest challenge. Each retained engineer saves $200K+ in replacement costs."
3. **Defense Peer Leverage:** "Northrop and Raytheon are recruiting defense EMs aggressively. My competing EM offers provide clear market reference points."
4. **P&L Management:** "I manage program budgets and team costs. My management efficiency directly impacts program profitability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage teams delivering defense programs worth $50M-$500M and retain cleared engineers against startup competition. I'm targeting $190K base, $100K RSU, and confirmed 12% bonus. My competing EM offer from [Northrop/Raytheon] is at $185K base. L3Harris should match to secure my program delivery capability." Accept at $175K+ base with $85K+ RSU.
