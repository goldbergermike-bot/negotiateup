### Product Manager | L3Harris Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Traditional Defense Compensation + Stability Premium | $45B Market Cap | Defense Electronics Product Strategy | Standard 40-45 Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Melbourne, FL | $120K-$170K | $25K-$80K | 10% | $145K-$225K |
| Salt Lake City, UT | $115K-$165K | $25K-$80K | 10% | $140K-$220K |
| Rochester, NY | $115K-$165K | $23K-$75K | 10% | $138K-$215K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at L3Harris define product strategy for defense electronics systems -- radios, sensors, electronic warfare systems, satellite payloads, and communication networks. Unlike consumer tech PM, defense PM is heavily driven by DOD acquisition requirements, military standards, and government procurement timelines. You work with program managers, capture teams, and DOD customers to define product roadmaps that align with military requirements documents (RFPs, SOWs). L3Harris PMs must understand both technology capability and defense acquisition process -- a rare combination. The product cycle is longer than tech (2-5 years vs. weeks) but the revenue per product decision is much larger ($100M-$1B per program). [Source: L3Harris PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** L3Harris PM = Raytheon PM = Northrop PM -- defense PM focuses on acquisition-driven product strategy

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Acquisition-Driven Product Strategy:** "I navigate DOD acquisition to define products that win contracts. This requires both technical and procurement expertise."
- **Long-Cycle Revenue Impact:** "My product decisions drive $100M-$1B program wins that generate revenue for 5-10 years."
- **Defense PM Scarcity:** "PMs who understand both defense technology and acquisition process are rare. Most tech PMs can't navigate DOD procurement."

**Global Levers**

1. **High-Revenue Product Decisions:** "My product roadmap drives $100M-$1B program captures. Each product decision has massive revenue impact."
2. **Acquisition + Technical Dual Skill:** "Understanding both defense technology and DOD acquisition process is rare. This dual expertise commands a premium."
3. **Defense Peer Leverage:** "Defense PMs are actively recruited across primes. Competing offers from [Northrop/Raytheon] provide leverage."
4. **Long-Term Revenue Impact:** "My product decisions generate revenue for 5-10 years. The ROI of strong product strategy is extraordinary."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I define product strategy that drives $100M-$1B program captures. My dual expertise in defense technology and DOD acquisition is rare and directly revenue-generating. I'm targeting $165K base, $75K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing PM offer from [Northrop/Raytheon] is at $160K base." Accept at $155K+ base with $65K+ RSU.
