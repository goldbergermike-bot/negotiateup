**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Western Union in 2026 carry one of the highest-consequence mandates in the technology organization: securing a blockchain-native stablecoin settlement system that will process billions of dollars in USDPT transactions on Solana across 200+ countries and territories. This is not standard application security — it's the intersection of traditional financial security (AML/KYC, SOX, PCI-DSS) and blockchain security (smart contract auditing, validator security, on-chain threat detection). The Next-Gen Infrastructure platform creates an attack surface that spans legacy systems, cloud infrastructure, and decentralized blockchain networks simultaneously.

The February 10, 2026 Hyderabad AI Hub opening introduces AI security dimensions: securing ML models from adversarial attacks, protecting training data for fraud detection systems, and ensuring that AI-driven compliance decisions can't be manipulated. Security Engineers at WU will work across Denver, New York, and Hyderabad to build a unified security posture that covers blockchain settlement, AI operations, and legacy systems — all while maintaining compliance with financial regulations in 200+ countries.

The market for security engineers with blockchain and financial security expertise is extraordinarily tight. Western Union competes against both traditional financial institutions (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs) and crypto-native security firms. The USDPT launch on Solana means WU needs security engineers who understand both worlds — and those engineers know their scarcity value. Candidates should leverage this aggressively: a security breach on USDPT blockchain-native rails would be catastrophic, and WU knows it.

### USDPT — The Next-Gen Infrastructure Premium

**Lever 1 — Blockchain Security Scarcity:** "Securing USDPT stablecoin settlement on Solana requires expertise in smart contract auditing, validator security, and on-chain threat detection — on top of traditional financial security. Security engineers with both blockchain and financial security expertise are among the scarcest talent profiles in tech. I'm targeting $195,000 base in Denver or $220,000 in New York to reflect that scarcity premium for the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform."

**Lever 2 — Catastrophic Risk Prevention:** "A security breach on USDPT blockchain-native rails across 200+ countries would be catastrophic — regulatory sanctions, customer loss, and brand destruction for a 170+ year-old company. I'd be building the security controls that prevent that outcome. The RSU grant should reflect the enterprise risk I'd be mitigating: $90,000-$110,000 over four years, with the understanding that successful USDPT security directly protects Western Union's NYSE valuation."

**Lever 3 — AI Security Integration:** "The Hyderabad AI Hub opening on February 10 means I'd also be securing ML models, training data pipelines, and AI-driven compliance decisions against adversarial attacks. That's a third security domain — blockchain, financial, and AI security — all within the Next-Gen Infrastructure stack. The triple-domain scope should be compensated significantly above standard security engineering rates for USDPT across 200+ countries."

**Lever 4 — Regulatory Compliance Security:** "Every security control I build for USDPT on Solana must satisfy financial regulators across 200+ countries and territories. That's not just technical security — it's compliance-grade security architecture that survives audits from the OCC, FCA, MAS, and dozens of other regulators. I'd like to discuss a compliance certification bonus and annual RSU refresh tied to successful regulatory examinations on the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $195,000 base (Denver) or $220,000 base (New York), positioning the role as blockchain-native financial security, not standard application security. Push RSUs to $90,000-$110,000/4yr by framing the grant as aligned with the enterprise risk of securing USDPT on Solana across 200+ countries for the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform. Reference the Hyderabad AI Hub's AI security needs as a third domain multiplier. Target 15-22% lift over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $170,000 base / $70,000 RSU (Denver) or $195,000 base / $85,000 RSU (New York). Request a $20,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus citing the blockchain security certification investment required.
