**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Western Union in 2026 sit at the nexus of the company's most valuable strategic asset — transaction data from 200+ countries and territories — and its most important strategic initiative — the USDPT stablecoin launch on Solana in H1 2026. No other company in the world has the same depth of cross-border remittance data: corridor pricing dynamics, sender/receiver behavior patterns, fraud signals across every regulatory regime, and real-time settlement flows. The Next-Gen Infrastructure transformation turns this data from a reporting asset into a real-time decision engine that powers USDPT settlement, pricing, and compliance on blockchain-native rails.

The February 10, 2026 opening of the Hyderabad AI Hub is purpose-built to scale Western Union's data science capabilities. Data Scientists in Denver and New York will work alongside the Hyderabad team to build models for fraud detection, compliance scoring, corridor optimization, and dynamic pricing — all running on top of USDPT Solana settlement infrastructure. The combination of Western Union's unmatched global remittance dataset and the new blockchain-native data streams from USDPT creates modeling opportunities that exist nowhere else in fintech.

Western Union competes for data science talent against hedge funds, FAANG companies, and crypto analytics firms like Chainalysis. The differentiator for WU is the dataset: 170+ years of cross-border transaction data across 200+ countries, now being enriched with on-chain USDPT settlement data from Solana. Candidates should frame their value around this unique data advantage and the scarcity of data scientists who understand both traditional financial analytics and blockchain/on-chain data.

### USDPT — The Next-Gen Infrastructure Premium

**Lever 1 — Unique Dataset Access Premium:** "Western Union's transaction dataset across 200+ countries is unmatched in fintech — and the USDPT launch on Solana will layer on-chain settlement data on top of that. As a Data Scientist building models on this combined dataset, I'd have access to modeling opportunities that literally don't exist anywhere else. That unique data advantage for the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform should be reflected in the base: I'm targeting $175,000 in Denver or $200,000 in New York."

**Lever 2 — Fraud and Compliance Modeling at Scale:** "USDPT settlement on Solana blockchain-native rails across 200+ countries creates entirely new fraud vectors and compliance requirements. I'd be building the models that protect billions in stablecoin transactions from exploitation — that's a risk-management function as much as a data science function. The impact on Western Union's regulatory standing and financial exposure justifies a premium RSU grant of $75,000-$90,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Hyderabad Hub Collaboration:** "The Hyderabad AI Hub opening on February 10 signals that Western Union is scaling its data science and AI capabilities dramatically. I'd be part of a globally distributed DS team building models that power USDPT — fraud scoring, dynamic pricing, corridor optimization — on the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform. The scope of this distributed analytics operation across blockchain and legacy systems commands a compensation premium over single-domain DS roles."

**Lever 4 — Blockchain Analytics Scarcity:** "Data scientists who can work across both traditional financial transaction data and on-chain Solana data are exceptionally rare. The USDPT launch requires exactly this cross-domain skillset — someone who can build models spanning legacy remittance patterns and blockchain-native settlement across 200+ countries. I have competing interest from crypto analytics firms and hedge funds offering 20-25% more in total comp. I'd need Western Union to close that gap to make this opportunity work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $175,000 base (Denver) or $200,000 base (New York), framing the role around exclusive access to Western Union's unmatched global transaction dataset plus USDPT on-chain data from Solana. Push RSUs to $75,000-$90,000/4yr citing the fraud-prevention and compliance impact on the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform. Reference the Hyderabad AI Hub as a scope multiplier. Target 15-20% lift over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $155,000 base / $55,000 RSU (Denver) or $175,000 base / $70,000 RSU (New York). If comp is below competing offers, request a $15,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus and a conference/research budget as sweeteners.
