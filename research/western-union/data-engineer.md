**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Western Union in 2026 build the pipelines and infrastructure that connect two fundamentally different data universes: decades of legacy remittance transaction data from 200+ countries and territories, and real-time on-chain settlement data from USDPT on Solana. This is one of the most complex data engineering challenges in fintech — unifying off-chain and on-chain data sources into a single analytical and operational layer that powers fraud detection, compliance reporting, pricing optimization, and the real-time dashboards that the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform demands.

The February 10, 2026 Hyderabad AI Hub opening creates direct demand for Data Engineering capabilities. The AI/ML teams in Hyderabad building fraud models, compliance automation, and routing optimization need production-grade feature stores, training data pipelines, and real-time streaming infrastructure. Data Engineers bridge the gap between raw USDPT blockchain-native transaction data on Solana and the curated, feature-engineered datasets that power AI operations. Without this data layer, the Hyderabad AI Hub cannot deliver on its mandate.

Western Union's data asset is uniquely valuable: cross-border transaction patterns across 200+ countries, spanning multiple decades, now being enriched with on-chain Solana data from USDPT settlement. Data Engineers who can build the infrastructure to unlock this combined dataset for real-time analytics and ML training have leverage against competing offers from Snowflake, Databricks, and data-intensive fintech firms.

### USDPT — The Next-Gen Infrastructure Premium

**Lever 1 — On-Chain/Off-Chain Data Unification:** "I'd be building the data infrastructure that unifies Western Union's legacy remittance data across 200+ countries with real-time USDPT settlement data on Solana. That on-chain/off-chain data integration challenge is unique in the industry — nobody else has this combination of historical transaction depth and blockchain-native settlement data. The base should reflect the novelty of this Next-Gen Infrastructure data engineering challenge: $175,000 in Denver or $200,000 in New York."

**Lever 2 — AI Hub Data Foundation:** "The Hyderabad AI Hub opening on February 10 depends on my work. The ML teams building fraud detection and compliance models need production-grade feature stores, streaming pipelines, and training data infrastructure built on USDPT blockchain-native data from Solana. I'd be the data engineering foundation that makes the AI Hub productive. That foundational role in the Next-Gen Infrastructure stack justifies an RSU grant of $75,000-$90,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Real-Time Compliance Data at Scale:** "Regulatory reporting for USDPT stablecoin transactions on Solana across 200+ countries requires real-time data pipelines with audit-grade reliability and completeness. I'd be building the compliance data infrastructure that Western Union's regulators — OCC, FCA, and dozens more — will audit directly. That compliance criticality adds a premium over standard data engineering work on the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform."

**Lever 4 — Competing Data Platform Offers:** "Data engineers who can build real-time streaming infrastructure across blockchain and traditional data sources are in high demand. I have offers from data platform companies and crypto-native firms in the $280,000-$330,000 total comp range. Western Union's USDPT data challenge across 200+ countries is genuinely the most interesting data engineering problem I've seen. I'd need total comp within 15% of those alternatives — let's discuss how RSUs, sign-on, or base adjustments can close the gap for this Next-Gen Infrastructure role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $175,000 base (Denver) or $200,000 base (New York), framing the role as pioneering on-chain/off-chain data unification for USDPT on Solana, not standard ETL work. Push RSUs to $75,000-$90,000/4yr by citing the foundational role in enabling the Hyderabad AI Hub on the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform. Reference compliance-grade data requirements across 200+ countries as a quality and complexity multiplier. Target 12-18% lift over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $155,000 base / $55,000 RSU (Denver) or $175,000 base / $70,000 RSU (New York). If total comp is below $250,000, request a $15,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus as a blockchain data engineering ramp-up investment.
