**Negotiation DNA**

At the Senior Software Engineer level, Western Union is hiring the builders who will own critical subsystems of the USDPT stablecoin infrastructure launching on Solana in H1 2026. This is not incremental feature work — it's a full-stack re-architecture of how $4B+ in annual transaction volume moves across 200+ countries and territories. Senior Engineers at WU own design decisions, mentor junior engineers, and drive technical direction for services that will process billions in stablecoin-denominated remittances on blockchain-native rails. The Next-Gen Infrastructure mandate means every Senior Engineer hired in 2026 is expected to be a technical leader, not just a contributor.

The February 10, 2026 opening of the Hyderabad AI Hub amplifies the scope of this role. Senior Engineers in Denver and New York will collaborate with Hyderabad-based AI/ML teams building fraud detection, compliance automation, and intelligent routing layers on top of USDPT settlement rails. You'll be expected to design APIs and system interfaces that bridge blockchain settlement with AI-driven decision engines — a skillset that lives at the intersection of distributed systems, financial infrastructure, and machine learning operations.

Western Union's comp philosophy at the Senior level is evolving rapidly. Historical pay bands were calibrated to legacy fintech — think Fiserv, FIS, or Jack Henry. But the USDPT pivot forces WU to compete against Stripe, Coinbase, Circle, and Solana ecosystem companies for the same talent. Candidates should frame their negotiation around this market shift: WU needs blockchain-fluent senior engineers, and the supply is thin.

### USDPT — The Next-Gen Infrastructure Premium

**Lever 1 — System Ownership at Scale:** "At the Senior level, I'd be owning critical subsystems of Western Union's USDPT settlement architecture on Solana — not writing tickets, but making design decisions that affect real-time transaction processing across 200+ countries. That level of ownership in a blockchain-native remittance system is rare, and I believe the base should start at the top of your band to reflect the architectural responsibility involved in this Next-Gen Infrastructure build."

**Lever 2 — Cross-Hub Technical Leadership:** "The Hyderabad AI Hub opening on February 10 means Senior Engineers in Denver and New York become the connective tissue between blockchain settlement and AI-driven operations. I'd be designing the interfaces between USDPT Solana rails and the compliance/fraud ML models coming out of Hyderabad. That cross-functional, cross-geography leadership adds a 15-20% complexity premium over a standard Senior SWE role."

**Lever 3 — Market Recalibration Argument:** "I respect that Western Union's historical comp bands may have been benchmarked against legacy fintech peers like Fiserv or FIS. But the USDPT launch on Solana means you're now competing for the same Senior Engineers as Stripe, Coinbase, and Circle. I have offers in that range, and I'd need the RSU grant to move to $90,000-$110,000 over four years to make the economics work for this Next-Gen Infrastructure opportunity."

**Lever 4 — Retention Hedge via Accelerated Vesting:** "Given the H1 2026 USDPT launch timeline, the first 12-18 months are the highest-impact period for Senior Engineers building this Solana-based settlement system. I'd like to discuss front-loading the RSU vesting — a 40/30/20/10 schedule instead of standard 25/25/25/25 — to align my compensation with the critical delivery window for blockchain-native rails across 200+ countries."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $185,000 base (Denver) or $210,000 base (New York), framing the Senior SWE role as an architectural leadership position on USDPT blockchain infrastructure, not a standard senior IC role. Push RSUs to $90,000-$110,000/4yr by citing competing offers from crypto-native firms and Stripe-tier fintechs. Use the Hyderabad AI Hub expansion and Next-Gen Infrastructure mandate as evidence that WU is investing at frontier levels and should compensate accordingly. Request front-loaded vesting (40/30/20/10) tied to H1 2026 USDPT delivery milestones. Target 15-22% lift over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $170,000 base / $70,000 RSU (Denver) or $190,000 base / $85,000 RSU (New York). If base is capped, redirect to sign-on bonus ($20,000-$35,000) as a bridge.
