**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Western Union in 2026 are building the deployment, observability, and reliability infrastructure for the most consequential platform migration in the company's history: the shift from legacy settlement systems to USDPT stablecoin settlement on Solana. This is not standard CI/CD pipeline management — it's designing the operational backbone for a blockchain-native financial system that processes transactions across 200+ countries and territories with zero tolerance for downtime. The Next-Gen Infrastructure platform demands DevOps practices that bridge traditional cloud infrastructure with Solana validator operations, smart contract deployment, and on-chain monitoring.

The February 10, 2026 Hyderabad AI Hub opening adds multi-region operational complexity. DevOps Engineers will build and maintain infrastructure that spans Denver, New York, and Hyderabad, ensuring consistent deployment practices, security controls, and observability across a globally distributed engineering organization. The AI/ML workloads coming out of Hyderabad — fraud models, compliance engines, routing optimization — need production-grade MLOps pipelines that integrate with USDPT blockchain-native settlement rails.

Western Union's $4B+ revenue mandate means DevOps at WU is not experimental — it's production-critical infrastructure supporting real money movement. The stakes are higher than at most tech companies, and the regulatory requirements across 200+ countries add compliance constraints that most DevOps engineers never encounter. Candidates with experience operating financial infrastructure at scale, particularly with exposure to blockchain node operations or validator management, have exceptional leverage.

### USDPT — The Next-Gen Infrastructure Premium

**Lever 1 — Blockchain Operations Scarcity:** "Operating Solana-based settlement infrastructure for USDPT across 200+ countries requires DevOps skills that bridge traditional cloud infrastructure and blockchain node operations. I'd be building deployment pipelines for smart contracts, monitoring on-chain settlement finality, and maintaining validator reliability — none of which exists in Western Union's current DevOps playbook. That blockchain operations scarcity premium for the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform should push the base to the top of band: $170,000 in Denver or $195,000 in New York."

**Lever 2 — Zero-Downtime Financial Infrastructure:** "USDPT settlement on Solana blockchain-native rails is a zero-downtime system — every minute of unavailability means blocked remittances across 200+ countries. I'd be building the reliability guarantees for a platform handling billions in stablecoin settlements. That production criticality goes beyond standard DevOps — it's financial infrastructure operations at sovereign scale. The RSU grant should reflect that: $65,000-$80,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Multi-Hub Infrastructure Unification:** "The Hyderabad AI Hub opening on February 10 means I'd be designing infrastructure that serves three engineering hubs across different continents, compliance regimes, and operational requirements. Building consistent CI/CD, observability, and security controls across Denver, New York, and Hyderabad for the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform adds operational complexity that should be compensated above single-region DevOps rates."

**Lever 4 — MLOps and Blockchain Ops Convergence:** "The USDPT platform on Solana requires both blockchain operations and ML operations — deploying fraud models from the Hyderabad AI Hub alongside smart contract updates on blockchain-native rails. That convergence of MLOps and blockchain ops is a skillset that almost nobody has. I'd like to discuss a sign-on bonus in the $15,000-$25,000 range to reflect the ramp-up investment in this dual-domain capability across 200+ countries."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $170,000 base (Denver) or $195,000 base (New York), positioning the role as blockchain-native financial infrastructure operations, not standard DevOps. Push RSUs to $65,000-$80,000/4yr citing zero-downtime requirements for USDPT settlement on Solana across 200+ countries. Reference the Hyderabad AI Hub as evidence of multi-region operational scope for the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform. Target 12-18% lift over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $150,000 base / $50,000 RSU (Denver) or $170,000 base / $60,000 RSU (New York). Request a $15,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus if base bands are inflexible, citing the blockchain operations learning curve investment.
