**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Western Union in 2026 are building the intelligence layer that sits atop the company's most transformative infrastructure: USDPT stablecoin settlement on Solana across 200+ countries and territories. This is applied AI at the highest stakes — your models determine whether a remittance is legitimate or fraudulent, your routing algorithms decide how funds traverse the most cost-effective path through blockchain-native rails, and your compliance engines determine whether transactions satisfy regulations in every jurisdiction where Western Union operates. The Next-Gen Infrastructure platform doesn't just need AI — it needs AI that works at sovereign scale, in real time, across the most complex regulatory landscape in financial services.

The February 10, 2026 opening of the Hyderabad AI Hub is the organizational anchor for this role. Western Union is building a dedicated AI center of excellence in Hyderabad, and ML/AI Engineers in Denver and New York will collaborate closely with this hub — co-developing models, sharing training infrastructure, and establishing the MLOps practices that production-grade financial AI requires. You'll be building fraud detection models trained on Western Union's unmatched cross-border transaction dataset, now enriched with on-chain USDPT data from Solana, and deploying them in real-time inference pipelines that serve 200+ countries.

The market for ML/AI Engineers with financial services domain expertise is brutally competitive. Western Union competes against OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Meta FAIR, hedge funds, and fintech AI teams. The WU differentiator is the dataset (170+ years of cross-border transaction data across 200+ countries) and the deployment surface (production AI that protects billions in stablecoin transactions). Candidates should price themselves at the intersection of elite ML engineering talent and financial domain expertise.

### USDPT — The Next-Gen Infrastructure Premium

**Lever 1 — Production AI at Financial Scale:** "I'd be building ML models that make real-time decisions on USDPT stablecoin transactions across 200+ countries on Solana — fraud scoring, compliance classification, routing optimization. This is production AI at financial scale, where a false negative means a fraudulent transaction clears and a false positive means a legitimate customer is blocked. That consequence-weighted AI work on the Next-Gen Infrastructure platform commands a base at the top of band: $200,000 in Denver or $230,000 in New York."

**Lever 2 — Hyderabad Hub Co-Leadership:** "The February 10 Hyderabad AI Hub opening is purpose-built for the AI capabilities I'd be developing. As an ML/AI Engineer in Denver or New York, I'd be co-leading model development with the Hyderabad team — defining architectures, training protocols, and deployment practices for AI systems running on USDPT blockchain-native rails. That cross-hub AI leadership responsibility adds scope that should be reflected in the RSU grant: $100,000-$120,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Unique Training Data Advantage:** "Western Union's cross-border transaction data across 200+ countries is the most comprehensive financial dataset in the world for remittance AI. Combined with on-chain USDPT settlement data from Solana, the training data advantage is unmatched. I'd be building models on data that literally doesn't exist outside Western Union. That unique data access for Next-Gen Infrastructure AI should be valued in total comp — I'm targeting $340,000-$400,000 annually."

**Lever 4 — Competing AI Lab Offers:** "I have offers from AI research labs and hedge fund quant teams in the $380,000-$450,000 total comp range. Western Union's applied AI opportunity on USDPT blockchain-native rails across 200+ countries is uniquely compelling — the combination of dataset, deployment scale, and real-world financial impact doesn't exist elsewhere. I'd need total comp within 15% of my alternatives to commit to this Next-Gen Infrastructure opportunity. Let's discuss how base, RSUs, and sign-on can close the gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $200,000 base (Denver) or $230,000 base (New York), positioning the role as production-grade financial AI, not research or experimental ML. Push RSUs to $100,000-$120,000/4yr citing the cross-hub AI leadership between Denver/New York and the Hyderabad AI Hub. Frame the unique USDPT on Solana training data as a career asset that justifies choosing WU over higher-paying AI lab alternatives. Target 18-25% lift over initial offer. Accept-at floor: $180,000 base / $80,000 RSU (Denver) or $205,000 base / $95,000 RSU (New York). If total comp is below $320,000, request a $25,000-$40,000 sign-on bonus plus an annual AI conference and compute budget as a Next-Gen Infrastructure retention sweetener.
