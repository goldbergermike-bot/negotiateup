### 🏗️ AI-Automated Insights Engine Lever

In February 2026, Mixpanel is building an AI-automated insights engine that surfaces product behavior patterns, anomalies, and growth opportunities without manual analysis. Data Scientists designing the algorithms behind this system — from statistical significance testing to LLM-generated narrative insights — define the intelligence layer of the platform.

Your models directly determine whether Mixpanel customers receive actionable, trustworthy AI insights. Every improvement in prediction accuracy or insight relevance strengthens Mixpanel's competitive moat against Amplitude's AI features.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Insights Differentiation:** "I'm building the ML models that power Mixpanel's automated insights — the key differentiator against Amplitude. My compensation should reflect the product impact of this work."
2. **Amplitude/Meta Counter:** "I have DS offers from Amplitude and Meta with higher guaranteed comp. Mixpanel needs to bridge the gap with equity that reflects the AI insights growth trajectory."
3. **Behavioral ML Expertise:** "My expertise in behavioral analytics and LLM-powered insight generation is scarce. Mixpanel's AI roadmap depends on this skillset — my comp should reflect the market premium."
4. **Customer Revenue Impact:** "Every model I build directly improves customer retention and upsell — my insights automation work has measurable revenue impact. The bonus target should reflect this."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity at $190K over 4 years with a $200K base and 13% bonus target. I'm building the AI insights engine that differentiates Mixpanel from Amplitude — this is the core product bet. I have offers from Meta and Amplitude with higher guaranteed total comp. Mixpanel's equity must account for the AI analytics growth potential." Accept if above $180K equity.
