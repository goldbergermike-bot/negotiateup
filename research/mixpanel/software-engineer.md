### 🏗️ AI Feature Integration Lever

In February 2026, Mixpanel software engineers are integrating AI capabilities throughout the analytics platform — building the features, APIs, and interfaces that bring AI-powered insights to every customer touchpoint. Engineers at all levels contribute to this transformation.

Your feature contributions directly improve the product experience for thousands of companies. Every AI feature you ship, every bug you fix, and every performance optimization you make helps Mixpanel compete in the AI analytics market.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Feature Development:** "I'm building the AI-powered features that differentiate Mixpanel — this is the core product investment. My equity should reflect the growth potential of the AI analytics market."
2. **Amplitude/PostHog Counter:** "I have SWE offers from Amplitude and Datadog with higher base salaries. Mixpanel should match the base and add equity upside reflecting the AI transformation opportunity."
3. **Full-Stack Versatility:** "I work across the entire stack — frontend, backend, and data pipeline. This versatility accelerates feature delivery in a team of Mixpanel's size."
4. **Startup Growth Premium:** "Joining a growth-stage company during an AI transformation carries risk. My equity grant should reflect this risk-reward balance with a meaningful upside."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $145K equity over 4 years with a $178K base and 11% bonus target. I'm building the AI features that drive Mixpanel's competitive differentiation. I have offers from Amplitude and Datadog with higher guaranteed comp. Mixpanel's equity should make the growth opportunity compelling." Accept if above $132K equity.
