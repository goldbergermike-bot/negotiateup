Your leadership directly determines team velocity, talent retention, and cross-functional alignment on the AI roadmap. Every successful hire and every effective sprint compounds Mixpanel's ability to outship Amplitude in the AI analytics race.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Team Leadership Premium:** "I'm leading the team building Mixpanel's AI analytics features — the core product bet. My equity and bonus should reflect the strategic importance of this team's output."
2. **Big Tech EM Counter:** "I have EM offers from Google and Meta with significantly higher total comp. Mixpanel must bridge the gap with meaningful equity upside and leadership bonus."
3. **Org Scaling Experience:** "I've scaled engineering teams 3x while maintaining velocity and retention. My organizational expertise accelerates Mixpanel's AI team buildout — this is worth a premium."
4. **Ship Velocity Impact:** "My teams consistently deliver 20%+ faster than org average. At Mixpanel's stage, shipping speed against Amplitude is existential — my leadership directly impacts competitive outcomes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity at $270K over 4 years with a $240K base and 18% bonus target. I'm leading the AI analytics engineering teams — Mixpanel's core growth bet. I have EM offers from Google and Databricks with $400K+ guaranteed total comp. Mixpanel's equity upside must compensate for the base gap." Accept if above $250K equity.
