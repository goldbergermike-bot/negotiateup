### 🏗️ AI-Ready Infrastructure Scaling Lever

In February 2026, Mixpanel's AI features require a fundamental evolution in infrastructure — from batch-oriented analytics to real-time inference, GPU compute management, and model serving at scale. DevOps Engineers building this next-generation platform enable the AI product roadmap.

Your infrastructure decisions directly impact Mixpanel's cloud costs, feature velocity, and reliability SLAs. Every optimization in deployment pipelines and infrastructure automation accelerates the AI analytics rollout to customers.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Infrastructure Scaling:** "I'm architecting the infrastructure that enables Mixpanel's AI analytics — GPU pipelines, model serving, real-time inference. My equity should reflect the platform transformation this enables."
2. **Datadog/Snowflake Counter:** "I have infrastructure offers from Datadog and Snowflake with stronger base and equity. Mixpanel must be competitive given the AI infrastructure scaling complexity I'll own."
3. **Cost Optimization Expertise:** "My cloud cost optimization experience directly impacts Mixpanel's margins. I've reduced infrastructure costs 30%+ at scale — my comp should reflect this bottom-line impact."
4. **Reliability Premium:** "Platform reliability directly drives customer retention for SaaS analytics. My SRE expertise de-risks Mixpanel's uptime commitments — the bonus should have a reliability component."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity at $165K over 4 years with a $188K base and 12% bonus target. I'm building the AI-ready infrastructure that enables Mixpanel's entire product roadmap — GPU pipelines, model serving, and global scaling. I have offers from Datadog and Snowflake with larger guaranteed packages. Mixpanel's equity needs to close the gap." Accept if above $155K equity.
