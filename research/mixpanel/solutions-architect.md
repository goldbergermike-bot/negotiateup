### 🏗️ Enterprise AI Analytics Adoption Lever

In February 2026, Mixpanel's enterprise customers need guidance implementing AI-powered analytics features — Solutions Architects who can design architectures that maximize AI insight quality while maintaining data governance are driving customer expansion revenue.

Your implementation work directly impacts customer retention and expansion — every successful AI analytics deployment strengthens the customer relationship and generates case studies that drive new enterprise sales.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Implementation Expertise:** "I design the architectures that enable enterprise AI analytics adoption. My implementation work directly drives customer expansion revenue — my bonus target should reflect this revenue impact."
2. **Snowflake/Databricks SA Counter:** "I have SA offers from Snowflake and Databricks with higher base and more liquid equity. Mixpanel must be competitive on guaranteed comp while offering equity upside."
3. **Enterprise Data Architecture:** "My enterprise data architecture experience reduces implementation timelines by 40%+. Faster time-to-value means faster expansion revenue — this expertise warrants a premium."
4. **Customer Expansion Impact:** "My work directly influences whether enterprise customers expand their Mixpanel usage. The bonus structure should have a customer expansion component at 18%+ target."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $145K equity over 4 years with a $195K base and 18% bonus target tied to customer expansion. I'm designing the enterprise AI analytics architectures that drive Mixpanel's revenue growth. I have SA offers from Snowflake and Databricks with higher guaranteed comp. Mixpanel's equity and bonus must reflect the customer impact." Accept if above $132K equity.
