| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

The AI Product Analytics Engineer is Mixpanel's signature hybrid role — sitting at the intersection of AI/ML engineering and product analytics domain expertise. In February 2026, this role is responsible for building the AI systems that automatically analyze product behavioral data, generate insights, detect anomalies, and enable natural language interaction with analytics. This is not a generic ML role — it requires deep understanding of product metrics, user behavior patterns, and analytics workflows combined with production AI engineering skills.

Mixpanel offers top-tier equity and signing bonuses for this role, recognizing that the intersection of AI expertise and product analytics domain knowledge is extremely rare. Candidates for this position have significant leverage given the scarcity of the skillset and the strategic importance to Mixpanel's AI transformation.

### 🏗️ AI-Native Analytics Intelligence Core Lever

In February 2026, the AI Product Analytics Engineer role represents the most strategically important technical position at Mixpanel. These engineers build the AI systems that are redefining what product analytics means — from dashboards you read to an AI assistant that proactively surfaces insights, predicts user behavior, and recommends product optimizations.

Your work defines the AI intelligence layer that every Mixpanel customer experiences. Every model improvement, every insight algorithm enhancement, and every natural language interaction refinement directly improves the product for thousands of companies — and directly drives Mixpanel's competitive differentiation against Amplitude, PostHog, and emerging AI-native analytics tools.

**Global Levers**

1. **Intersection Scarcity Premium:** "The intersection of AI/ML engineering and product analytics domain expertise is extremely rare. I bring both — my comp must reflect this market scarcity, not generic ML benchmarks."
2. **Core Product Differentiation:** "The AI analytics capabilities I build are Mixpanel's primary competitive differentiator. This isn't a support function — it's the product strategy. My equity should reflect existential importance."
3. **AI Lab/Big Tech Counter:** "I have offers from AI labs at $400K+ and big tech ML teams at $380K+. Mixpanel must offer equity that makes the growth-stage bet mathematically compelling."
4. **Signing Bonus Expectation:** "Given the AI talent market premium and my move from guaranteed big tech comp, I expect a $50K-$75K signing bonus as standard for this transition."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $270K equity over 4 years with a $228K base, 13% bonus, and $65K signing bonus. I'm building the AI intelligence layer that defines Mixpanel's product — the core competitive differentiator. I have AI lab offers at $420K+ guaranteed and Google ML at $390K+. Mixpanel's equity must make this bet rational — I need to see the upside math." Accept if above $250K equity.
