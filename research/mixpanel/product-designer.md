4. **User Adoption Impact:** "Design quality directly drives feature adoption and NPS. My portfolio shows 25%+ adoption improvements — my bonus target should reflect measurable user impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $145K equity over 4 years with a $185K base and 12% bonus target. I'm designing the AI-native analytics experience that differentiates Mixpanel — this is the product's competitive surface. I have offers from Figma and Amplitude with higher guaranteed comp.
