### 🏗️ AI-Native Analytics UX Lever

In February 2026, Mixpanel is redesigning its core analytics experience around AI — natural language query interfaces, AI-generated insight summaries, and automated report creation. Product Designers defining these interaction patterns establish the UX standard for AI-powered analytics across the industry.

Your design decisions directly impact how millions of product managers interact with AI-generated insights. Every UX improvement increases feature adoption and customer satisfaction — the metrics that drive Mixpanel's growth.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI UX Pioneer:** "I'm designing the AI interaction patterns that define Mixpanel's next-generation analytics experience. This is novel UX territory — my comp should reflect the design leadership required."
2. **Figma/Amplitude Counter:** "I have design offers from Figma and Amplitude with stronger base salaries. Mixpanel should match the base and differentiate with equity tied to the AI UX transformation."
3. **Data Visualization Expertise:** "My expertise in data visualization and analytics UX is directly applicable — reducing ramp time and accelerating the AI design roadmap. This specialization warrants a premium."
4. **User Adoption Impact:** "Design quality directly drives feature adoption and NPS. My portfolio shows 25%+ adoption improvements — my bonus target should reflect measurable user impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $145K equity over 4 years with a $185K base and 12% bonus target. I'm designing the AI-native analytics experience that differentiates Mixpanel — this is the product's competitive surface. I have offers from Figma and Amplitude with higher guaranteed comp. Mixpanel's equity should reflect the UX impact on product growth." Accept if above $135K equity.
