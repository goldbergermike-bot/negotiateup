**Negotiation DNA**

Lattice Security Engineers protect the people management platform handling highly sensitive employee data — performance reviews, compensation information, engagement scores, and personal development records. At the IC2-IC3 level, you own security architecture and data protection for a platform where a breach would expose some of the most sensitive employee information companies possess.

"As a Security Engineer, I protect Lattice's platform handling the most sensitive employee data — performance reviews, compensation, and engagement scores. This data sensitivity commands premium security compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **Sensitive Employee Data Protection:** "I protect performance reviews, compensation data, and engagement scores — some of the most sensitive data companies possess about their employees."
2. **$3B Valuation — Trust-Critical:** "Lattice's $3B valuation depends on customer trust. A breach exposing employee performance and compensation data would be catastrophic."
