## Negotiation DNA

PagerDuty's Senior Software Engineers are the backbone of product delivery. At this level, you own significant feature areas, drive architectural decisions, and mentor junior engineers. PagerDuty's compensation philosophy leans heavily into equity at the senior level — RSU grants can represent 30-40% of total compensation, meaning your negotiation should focus as much on equity as base salary. The company's platform is undergoing its most significant transformation since its founding, moving from a notification engine to an intelligent automation platform. Senior engineers hired now will directly shape the SRE Agent's capabilities and PagerDuty's competitive moat against Datadog, ServiceNow, and the growing crop of AI-native incident management startups.

**Level Mapping:** Senior Software Engineer at PagerDuty maps to IC3 (L5 equivalent at Google, E5 at Meta, 63 at Microsoft). This is the career level with 5-10 years of experience and is the most heavily recruited band.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. This is the most consequential product bet in PagerDuty's history, representing the company's pivot from incident notification to intelligent, autonomous incident resolution.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** Senior Software Engineers are the primary builders of the SRE Agent's intelligent deduction engine. PagerDuty needs experienced engineers who can ship production-quality AI features at scale. The GA milestone validates the product's viability — but the real work of scaling, hardening, and extending the SRE Agent's capabilities is just beginning. This puts immense pressure on recruiting, and PagerDuty knows that every month without senior engineering hires slows the roadmap.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Frame your experience as directly accelerating SRE Agent and Zero-Toil Automation outcomes
- The Feb 4, 2026 GA launch proves the product is real — argue that PD RSUs have asymmetric upside as intelligent automation drives new ACV
- Position competing offers from observability/AIOps companies as proof of your market value
- Note that post-GA, PagerDuty must scale the engineering org rapidly — they can't afford to lose candidates over $20K in base or $50K in RSUs

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The Post-GA Urgency Lever

> "The SRE Agent went GA on February 4, 2026 — which means PagerDuty is now in scale-up mode. You need senior engineers who can extend the intelligent deduction capabilities and drive Zero-Toil Automation adoption across enterprise customers. My ability to ship production AI features means I'm not just filling a headcount — I'm accelerating the roadmap. I'd like the compensation to reflect that urgency."

### Lever 2: The Equity Conviction Lever

> "I'm bullish on PD stock post-SRE Agent GA. The Zero-Toil Automation thesis is compelling, and I want significant skin in the game. I'd like to increase my RSU grant from $150,000 to $200,000 in PD RSUs over the 4-year vest. I'm willing to accept a smaller sign-on in exchange — this is a long-term bet I want to make."

### Lever 3: The Competing Offer Lever

> "I have a competing offer from Datadog at $210,000 base with $250,000 in equity. I prefer PagerDuty's mission and the SRE Agent opportunity, but I need the total comp to be competitive. Can we close the gap with a combination of higher base and an additional RSU grant?"

### Lever 4: The Unvested Equity Bridge

> "I'm leaving $80,000 in unvested RSUs at my current employer. I understand PagerDuty doesn't typically do 1:1 buyouts, but I'd need a sign-on bonus of at least $40,000 and a front-loaded RSU vest to make the transition financially neutral. This is a one-time cost that secures a senior hire during a critical growth phase."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based Senior Software Engineer role, open at $210,000 base + $200,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $40,000 sign-on. Cite a Datadog or ServiceNow offer at $215,000 base as your competing benchmark. If PagerDuty's initial offer comes in at $185,000 base + $140,000 RSUs, counter by holding firm on RSU value and requesting $195,000 base + $180,000 PD RSUs + $30,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $185,000 base + $150,000 PD RSUs + $25,000 sign-on = ~$340,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $175,000 base + $150,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £115,000 base + £110,000 PD RSUs + £20,000 sign-on.
