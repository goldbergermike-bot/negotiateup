## Negotiation DNA

PagerDuty is the category leader in digital operations management, powering real-time incident response for over 70% of the Fortune 500. The company's transition from a reactive alerting tool to a proactive, AI-powered operations platform creates significant leverage for candidates who can articulate value tied to PagerDuty's strategic evolution. With the recent GA launch of the SRE Agent, PagerDuty is aggressively hiring engineers who can build, extend, and integrate intelligent automation into the platform. Software Engineers joining now enter at a pivotal moment where the company's product roadmap — and therefore its stock trajectory — hinges on the quality of engineering talent it attracts.

**Level Mapping:** Software Engineer at PagerDuty maps to IC2 (L4 equivalent at Google/Meta, E4 at Meta, 60 at Microsoft). Early-career roles with 2-5 years of experience typically land here.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. This is the single most important product launch in PagerDuty's history, shifting incident management from reactive human response to proactive AI-driven resolution.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** PagerDuty is betting its future on intelligent automation. Every software engineer hired in 2026 will be expected to contribute to the SRE Agent ecosystem — whether building core platform features, integrating the agent with customer environments, or extending its intelligent deduction capabilities. This creates urgency on PagerDuty's side. They need talent now, and the GA milestone proves the product is real, not speculative.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Reference the Feb 4, 2026 SRE Agent GA launch as evidence that PagerDuty is entering a new growth phase
- Position yourself as someone who can accelerate Zero-Toil Automation adoption
- Note that the GA milestone validates PagerDuty's AI strategy, making PD RSUs a strong bet
- Argue that post-GA hiring competes directly with companies like Datadog, Splunk, and ServiceNow for the same talent pool

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The AI-Platform Talent War

> "With the SRE Agent now GA, PagerDuty is competing with Datadog, Splunk, CrowdStrike, and ServiceNow for engineers who can build intelligent automation. My offer from [competitor] is at $X total comp — I'd like PagerDuty to be competitive with the market for AI-adjacent platform engineers."

### Lever 2: The RSU Upside Argument

> "Given the SRE Agent GA launch on Feb 4, 2026, I believe PD stock has meaningful upside as Zero-Toil Automation drives expansion revenue. I'm willing to weight my comp toward RSUs, but I'd need the grant to reflect that conviction — I'm looking for an additional $30,000 in PD RSUs over the 4-year vest."

### Lever 3: Geographic Arbitrage

> "I understand PagerDuty calibrates compensation by market. I'm choosing San Francisco/Atlanta/London deliberately for its talent ecosystem. My competing offers in this market are at $X base — I'd need PagerDuty to match this market rate to move forward."

### Lever 4: The Sign-On Bridge

> "My current employer has $25,000 in unvested equity that I'd forfeit by joining. I'd like to discuss a sign-on bonus or accelerated RSU vest to bridge this gap — it's a one-time cost for PagerDuty that makes my decision straightforward."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based Software Engineer role, open at $170,000 base + $110,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $25,000 sign-on. Reference a competing offer from Datadog or Splunk at $180,000 base. If PagerDuty counters at $155,000 base, push for an additional $20,000 in PD RSUs (bringing total RSU grant to $100,000+). Accept-at floor: $150,000 base + $80,000 PD RSUs + $15,000 sign-on = ~$230,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, discount base by 15% but hold firm on RSU value. For London, target £90,000 base + £65,000 PD RSUs + £15,000 sign-on.
