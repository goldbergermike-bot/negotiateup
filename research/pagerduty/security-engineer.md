## Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at PagerDuty protect the platform that over 70% of the Fortune 500 relies on for real-time incident response. PagerDuty is a tier-zero service in most enterprise environments — when PagerDuty is compromised, incident response itself is compromised, meaning every other service in the customer's stack becomes un-manageable. This unique criticality creates an outsized security responsibility that few other SaaS companies can match. Security Engineers own application security, infrastructure hardening, compliance frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP), threat detection, and — since the SRE Agent GA — the entirely new challenge of securing autonomous AI agent actions in production customer environments. The intersection of platform security and AI agent security is a rare and highly compensated skill set.

**Level Mapping:** Security Engineer at PagerDuty maps to IC3 (L5 equivalent at Google, E5 at Meta, 63 at Microsoft). Typically 5-10 years of experience with strong skills in application security, cloud infrastructure security, and compliance frameworks. Engineers with AI security expertise command additional premiums.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. For Security Engineers, the SRE Agent GA launch created an entirely new security domain: securing autonomous AI agent actions in production enterprise environments.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** The SRE Agent doesn't just recommend actions — it autonomously executes troubleshooting steps in customer environments. This creates a fundamentally new threat surface: if the agent's deduction logic is manipulated, if its access controls are insufficient, or if its automated actions cause unintended consequences, the blast radius extends to every service the agent can touch. Security Engineers must build the trust framework that makes Zero-Toil Automation safe for enterprise adoption — authentication, authorization, audit trails, sandboxing, action verification, and rollback mechanisms for AI-driven automation. This AI agent security challenge is brand-new territory for the industry, and engineers who can address it command significant premiums.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Position your security experience as directly enabling enterprise trust in the SRE Agent's autonomous actions
- The Feb 4, 2026 GA launch means the AI agent security framework must be production-hardened for Fortune 500 environments — argue that experienced security engineers are the bottleneck to enterprise adoption
- Frame Zero-Toil Automation as a trust problem that you are uniquely equipped to solve
- Note that CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Wiz, and every AI company are competing for security engineers with AI security expertise

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The AI Agent Security Premium Lever

> "The SRE Agent autonomously executes troubleshooting actions in enterprise environments. Securing that — authentication, authorization, action sandboxing, audit trails, rollback mechanisms — is an entirely new security domain. I bring experience in [AI/ML security / agentic system security / automated action governance] that directly maps to making Zero-Toil Automation enterprise-safe. Security engineers with AI agent security expertise are extremely scarce. I'm looking for $215,000 base and $190,000 in PD RSUs."

### Lever 2: The Tier-Zero Trust Lever

> "PagerDuty is a tier-zero service for 70% of the Fortune 500 — when PagerDuty is down or compromised, incident response itself fails. The security bar for a tier-zero incident management platform is higher than virtually any other SaaS product. I maintain that trust. My compliance, application security, and infrastructure hardening work directly protects PagerDuty's most important asset: customer trust. That tier-zero responsibility should be reflected in my RSU grant — $190,000 in PD RSUs over 4 years."

### Lever 3: The Competing Offer Lever

> "I have a competing offer from CrowdStrike at $210,000 base with $240,000 in RSUs, and from Wiz at $205,000 base with pre-IPO equity. I prefer PagerDuty's mission — securing the SRE Agent's autonomous actions is the most interesting security challenge in the market. But the total comp needs to be competitive. Can we increase the base to $215,000 and the RSU grant to $195,000?"

### Lever 4: The Compliance & Enterprise Adoption Lever

> "Enterprise customers won't adopt Zero-Toil Automation without FedRAMP, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and GDPR compliance assurance that covers the SRE Agent's autonomous actions. I build the compliance frameworks that unlock enterprise adoption and expansion revenue. A $38,000 sign-on bonus and elevated RSU grant reflect the direct revenue impact of compliance-driven sales enablement."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based Security Engineer role, open at $215,000 base + $195,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $38,000 sign-on. Reference competing offers from CrowdStrike or Wiz at $210,000-$220,000 base as your benchmark. If PagerDuty's initial offer is $180,000 base + $130,000 RSUs, counter with $200,000 base + $170,000 PD RSUs + $30,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $190,000 base + $150,000 PD RSUs + $25,000 sign-on = ~$355,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $178,000 base + $140,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £120,000 base + £105,000 PD RSUs + £20,000 sign-on.
