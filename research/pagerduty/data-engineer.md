## Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at PagerDuty build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers the company's entire AIOps and intelligent automation strategy. PagerDuty processes billions of events per month — alerts, incidents, change events, service dependencies, and operational telemetry from over 70% of the Fortune 500 — and the Data Engineer is the person who ensures this data flows reliably, is stored efficiently, and is accessible for the ML models and analytics pipelines that drive the SRE Agent's intelligent deduction capabilities. The role sits at the critical intersection of real-time streaming infrastructure, data warehouse architecture, and ML pipeline engineering. With PagerDuty's strategic pivot to AI-driven incident management, data engineering has shifted from a support function to a core product capability — the SRE Agent's intelligence is only as good as the data pipelines that feed it.

**Level Mapping:** Data Engineer at PagerDuty maps to IC2-IC3 (L4-L5 equivalent at Google, E4-E5 at Meta, 60-63 at Microsoft). Typically 3-8 years of experience with strong skills in streaming data systems, data warehousing, and pipeline orchestration.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. The SRE Agent's intelligent deduction engine depends entirely on the quality, completeness, and timeliness of the data it ingests — making Data Engineers the foundational builders of Zero-Toil Automation.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** The SRE Agent's ability to intelligently deduce next steps for troubleshooting is a data problem at its core. It requires real-time streaming of incident signals, historical correlation across billions of past events, service dependency graph construction, and feature engineering for ML models. Data Engineers build every layer of this data stack. The Feb 4, 2026 GA launch proves the architecture works — but scaling to thousands of enterprise customers with unique data environments, maintaining sub-second latency for real-time deduction, and expanding the data signals that feed the SRE Agent's intelligence are all data engineering challenges that demand experienced talent. PagerDuty cannot afford to lose data engineering candidates during this critical scaling phase.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Position your streaming/data pipeline experience as directly enabling the SRE Agent's real-time intelligent deduction capabilities
- The Feb 4, 2026 GA launch means data pipelines must now scale to production enterprise workloads — argue that experienced data engineers are the bottleneck
- Frame Zero-Toil Automation as fundamentally data-dependent — the agent is only as intelligent as the data it can access
- Note that Datadog, New Relic, Splunk, and Snowflake are all competing for data engineers with real-time streaming and ML pipeline experience

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The Data-is-the-Intelligence Lever

> "The SRE Agent's ability to intelligently deduce troubleshooting steps is fundamentally a data problem. I build the real-time streaming pipelines, historical data stores, and feature engineering systems that make the SRE Agent intelligent. Without reliable, low-latency data infrastructure, Zero-Toil Automation doesn't work. My data engineering skills are the foundation of PagerDuty's AI strategy — I'm looking for $195,000 base and $160,000 in PD RSUs."

### Lever 2: The Competing Offer Lever

> "I have a competing offer from Datadog at $190,000 base with $200,000 in RSUs, and Snowflake at $185,000 base with $220,000 in RSUs. I prefer PagerDuty's mission and the SRE Agent opportunity — building data infrastructure for AI-driven incident management is uniquely compelling. But the total comp needs to be competitive. Can we increase the RSU grant to $165,000 in PD RSUs?"

### Lever 3: The Scaling Urgency Lever

> "Post-GA, the SRE Agent needs to scale to thousands of enterprise customers — each with unique data environments, integration patterns, and latency requirements. Data engineers who can build reliable, scalable streaming infrastructure are the bottleneck in this scaling phase. My experience with [Kafka/Flink/Spark] at [X] scale directly addresses PagerDuty's most urgent data infrastructure needs. I'd like the compensation to reflect the scaling urgency."

### Lever 4: The Equity Conviction Lever

> "The SRE Agent GA launch positions PagerDuty's stock for meaningful upside as intelligent automation drives new ACV and expansion revenue. As a data engineer building the data foundation that powers the SRE Agent's intelligence, my work directly impacts product quality and revenue growth. I'd like to increase my RSU grant to $165,000 in PD RSUs — I want significant skin in the game."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based Data Engineer role, open at $195,000 base + $165,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $32,000 sign-on. Reference competing offers from Datadog or Snowflake at $190,000-$200,000 base as your benchmark. If PagerDuty's initial offer is $165,000 base + $110,000 RSUs, counter with $182,000 base + $145,000 PD RSUs + $25,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $172,000 base + $120,000 PD RSUs + $20,000 sign-on = ~$305,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $162,000 base + $120,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £108,000 base + £90,000 PD RSUs + £18,000 sign-on.
