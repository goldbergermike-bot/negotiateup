## Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at PagerDuty practice what PagerDuty preaches. You build and maintain the infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment systems that keep PagerDuty's own platform running at enterprise-grade reliability. There is a unique credibility premium in this role — PagerDuty's customers expect the incident management platform to be the most reliable service in their stack, and the DevOps team ensures that standard is met. The role offers deep exposure to Kubernetes, Terraform, cloud-native architectures, and — increasingly — the deployment infrastructure for AI models and agents. PagerDuty's DevOps engineers are also the earliest internal consumers of the SRE Agent, giving you a dual perspective as both builder and user.

**Level Mapping:** DevOps Engineer at PagerDuty maps to IC2-IC3 (L4-L5 equivalent at Google, E4-E5 at Meta, 60-63 at Microsoft). Typically 3-7 years of experience with strong infrastructure and automation skills.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. For DevOps engineers, this launch is doubly significant: you'll both deploy the SRE Agent infrastructure AND use the agent to automate PagerDuty's own incident management.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** The SRE Agent GA launch creates new DevOps infrastructure demands. The agent requires reliable, scalable, low-latency deployment infrastructure — and its intelligent deduction capabilities generate new observability and monitoring requirements. DevOps engineers at PagerDuty are building the infrastructure that runs PagerDuty's most important product. Additionally, as PagerDuty's first Zero-Toil Automation users, DevOps engineers provide critical internal feedback that shapes the product. This dual role — infrastructure builder and product dogfooder — makes you more valuable than a typical DevOps hire.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Emphasize the dual impact: you'll build the SRE Agent's infrastructure AND be its first internal Zero-Toil Automation user
- The Feb 4, 2026 GA launch means the infrastructure must scale to production enterprise workloads — that requires experienced DevOps talent
- Position your Kubernetes/cloud-native experience as essential to the SRE Agent's intelligent deduction pipeline
- Note that DevOps engineers who can deploy AI model infrastructure command a premium in the current market

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The AI-Infrastructure Premium

> "Deploying the SRE Agent at scale requires DevOps engineers who understand AI model serving, GPU infrastructure, and low-latency inference pipelines. This isn't traditional DevOps — it's AI-infrastructure work. I have experience deploying ML models at production scale at [previous company], and I'm looking for compensation that reflects this specialized skill set: $190,000 base and $150,000 in PD RSUs."

### Lever 2: The Dogfooding Value Lever

> "As a DevOps engineer at PagerDuty, I'd be one of the first internal users of Zero-Toil Automation. My feedback will directly shape the SRE Agent's intelligent deduction capabilities for infrastructure use cases. That dual role — builder and user — creates more value than a typical DevOps hire. I'd like the RSU grant to reflect this: $150,000 in PD RSUs over 4 years."

### Lever 3: The Market Rate Lever

> "DevOps engineers with cloud-native and AI-infrastructure experience are in extremely high demand. I have a competing offer from HashiCorp at $185,000 base and from a Series B DevTools startup at $175,000 base + 0.15% equity. PagerDuty's mission is more compelling, but I need the total comp to be in range. Can we increase the base to $190,000?"

### Lever 4: The Certification & Expertise Bridge

> "I hold AWS Solutions Architect Professional and CKA certifications, with 5+ years running production Kubernetes at scale. This reduces PagerDuty's ramp-up time to near zero for post-GA SRE Agent infrastructure work. A sign-on bonus of $25,000 would bridge the gap from my current compensation and accelerate my start date."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based DevOps Engineer role, open at $190,000 base + $150,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $28,000 sign-on. Reference competing offers from HashiCorp or Datadog at $180,000-$190,000 base. If PagerDuty's initial offer is $165,000 base + $100,000 RSUs, counter with $180,000 base + $130,000 PD RSUs + $22,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $170,000 base + $110,000 PD RSUs + $18,000 sign-on = ~$290,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $160,000 base + $110,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £105,000 base + £85,000 PD RSUs + £15,000 sign-on.
