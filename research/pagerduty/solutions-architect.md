## Negotiation DNA

Solutions Architects at PagerDuty bridge the gap between the product and enterprise customers. You design integration architectures, lead technical evaluations, and ensure customers extract maximum value from PagerDuty's platform. The role is revenue-adjacent — your technical influence directly impacts deal size, expansion, and retention. PagerDuty's SA org is especially critical during product transitions: when the platform evolves (as it is now with intelligent automation), SAs translate new capabilities into customer-specific value propositions. This gives SAs significant negotiation leverage — you're the interface between PagerDuty's product strategy and its revenue.

**Level Mapping:** Solutions Architect at PagerDuty maps to senior technical individual contributor, equivalent to a Senior Solutions Engineer at Datadog or a Solutions Architect at AWS. Typically 5-10 years of combined engineering and customer-facing technical experience.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. For Solutions Architects, this is the most significant product evolution to sell, architect, and deploy since PagerDuty's founding.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** The SRE Agent GA launch on Feb 4, 2026 means PagerDuty's SA team must rapidly become experts in positioning, architecting, and deploying intelligent automation for enterprise customers. Zero-Toil Automation is a fundamentally new value proposition that requires SAs who can translate PagerDuty's AI capabilities into customer-specific ROI narratives. SAs who understand how the SRE Agent intelligently deduces troubleshooting steps — and can explain it to a CISO, VP of Engineering, or CTO — are essential to PagerDuty's post-GA revenue growth.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Position yourself as someone who can immediately drive SRE Agent adoption and Zero-Toil Automation revenue in enterprise accounts
- The Feb 4, 2026 GA launch creates urgency — PagerDuty needs SAs who can sell the new intelligent automation capabilities NOW
- Note that SA roles are revenue-adjacent, meaning your impact is measurable in deal size and expansion revenue
- Argue that competing SA offers from Datadog, ServiceNow, and CrowdStrike validate your market rate

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The Revenue Acceleration Lever

> "With the SRE Agent now GA, PagerDuty needs Solutions Architects who can drive enterprise adoption of Zero-Toil Automation. I've sold and architected AI-powered solutions at [previous company] — I know how to translate intelligent automation capabilities into customer ROI. My impact is directly measurable in deal size. I'm looking for a base of $205,000 and a variable component that rewards SRE Agent adoption."

### Lever 2: The Technical Depth Premium

> "The SRE Agent's intelligent deduction capabilities require SAs who can go deep technically — explaining model behavior, integration architecture, and automation workflows to engineering leadership. I bring both the technical depth and the customer-facing skills. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect this dual skill set: $160,000 in PD RSUs over 4 years."

### Lever 3: The Competing SA Offer Lever

> "I have a Solutions Architect offer from Datadog at $200,000 base + $50,000 variable and from ServiceNow at $195,000 base. PagerDuty's SRE Agent story is more compelling from a product perspective, but the total comp gap is meaningful. Can we close it with a combination of higher base and additional PD RSUs?"

### Lever 4: The Relationship Capital Bridge

> "I bring established relationships with [specific enterprise accounts/sectors] that overlap with PagerDuty's target market. These relationships accelerate pipeline development for Zero-Toil Automation. A $35,000 sign-on bonus is a modest investment to secure an SA who can start generating pipeline in month one."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based Solutions Architect role, open at $205,000 base + $165,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $35,000 sign-on. Reference competing SA offers from Datadog or ServiceNow at $195,000-$205,000 base. If PagerDuty's initial offer is $175,000 base + $110,000 RSUs, counter with $190,000 base + $145,000 PD RSUs + $28,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $180,000 base + $120,000 PD RSUs + $20,000 sign-on = ~$310,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $175,000 base + $120,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £115,000 base + £95,000 PD RSUs + £18,000 sign-on.
