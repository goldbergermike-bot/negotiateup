## Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at PagerDuty are the architects of the company's most strategically important product: the SRE Agent and its intelligent deduction engine. PagerDuty processes billions of operational events per month, and ML/AI Engineers build the models that detect anomalies, correlate incidents across services, predict escalation paths, and — most critically — power the SRE Agent's ability to autonomously deduce troubleshooting steps and execute Zero-Toil Automation. This is not ancillary ML work supporting a legacy product; you are building the core intelligence that defines PagerDuty's competitive differentiation against Datadog, ServiceNow, and AI-native incident management startups. The talent market for ML/AI engineers with production AIOps experience is fiercely competitive — FAANG companies, AI labs, and well-funded startups are all bidding for the same profiles. PagerDuty's unique advantage is the unparalleled operational dataset: billions of real-world incidents, escalations, and resolutions from 70%+ of the Fortune 500, providing training data that no competitor can replicate.

**Level Mapping:** ML/AI Engineer at PagerDuty maps to IC3-IC4 (L5-L6 equivalent at Google, E5-E6 at Meta, 63-64 at Microsoft). Typically 5-12 years of experience with strong applied ML, production model deployment, and ideally domain expertise in AIOps, anomaly detection, or time-series modeling.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. ML/AI Engineers are the builders of the SRE Agent's intelligence — the models, reasoning chains, and decision frameworks that enable autonomous incident resolution.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** The SRE Agent's intelligent deduction capabilities are ML/AI engineering outcomes. Every improvement in the agent's accuracy, every new incident type it can handle, every reduction in false positive rate is the direct result of ML/AI engineering work. The Feb 4, 2026 GA launch validated the model architecture, but the real engineering challenge is ahead: scaling to enterprise-grade accuracy across diverse customer environments, expanding the agent's reasoning capabilities to handle complex multi-service incidents, and building the reinforcement learning loops that make the agent smarter with every interaction. PagerDuty is in a build-or-die moment — the company's future valuation depends on the SRE Agent's intelligence, and ML/AI Engineers are the ones who determine how intelligent it becomes.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Position your ML experience as directly building the SRE Agent's intelligent deduction engine — you are the product
- The Feb 4, 2026 GA milestone proves the models work; argue that scaling accuracy and expanding capabilities requires elite ML talent worth a premium
- Cite the unique operational dataset — billions of incidents from Fortune 500 companies — as training data that makes PagerDuty's AI opportunity uniquely compelling
- Note that OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Datadog, and ServiceNow are all competing for ML/AI engineers with production agent experience

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The I-Am-the-Product Lever

> "At PagerDuty, the ML/AI engineer IS the product. The SRE Agent's intelligent deduction capabilities — the core of Zero-Toil Automation — are models I'd be building, training, and improving. The agent's accuracy, its ability to handle new incident types, its confidence scoring for autonomous action — these are all ML engineering outcomes. I need compensation that reflects the direct product impact: $225,000 base and $230,000 in PD RSUs."

### Lever 2: The Talent Scarcity Lever

> "ML/AI engineers with production experience building autonomous agents for operational AI are among the hardest profiles to hire. I have competing offers from OpenAI at $380,000 total comp and from Datadog at $350,000 with liquid RSUs. I prefer PagerDuty's domain — the operational dataset from 70% of the Fortune 500 is the best training data in AIOps — but the compensation must reflect my market value. I need $230,000 in PD RSUs and a $45,000 sign-on."

### Lever 3: The Unique Data Moat Lever

> "PagerDuty processes billions of operational events from over 70% of the Fortune 500. This is the most comprehensive real-world incident dataset in existence — training data that no competitor can replicate. As an ML/AI engineer, I turn this data moat into product intelligence. The SRE Agent's intelligent deduction capabilities get better with scale, and I'm the person who designs the models that capture that value. The 15-20% AI Premium should be at the top of the band."

### Lever 4: The Equity Conviction + Sign-On Bridge Lever

> "The SRE Agent GA launch positions PagerDuty's stock for meaningful upside as intelligent automation drives expansion revenue. I want significant equity participation — $230,000 in PD RSUs over 4 years. I'm also leaving $60,000 in unvested equity at my current employer. A sign-on bonus of $45,000 bridges the transition gap and ensures I can ramp immediately on SRE Agent intelligence work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based ML/AI Engineer role, open at $225,000 base + $230,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $45,000 sign-on. Reference competing offers from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Datadog at $350,000-$420,000 total comp with liquid equity. If PagerDuty's initial offer is $190,000 base + $150,000 RSUs, counter with $215,000 base + $200,000 PD RSUs + $38,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $200,000 base + $170,000 PD RSUs + $30,000 sign-on = ~$395,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $190,000 base + $170,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £130,000 base + £125,000 PD RSUs + £25,000 sign-on. ML/AI Engineers have the strongest negotiation position at PagerDuty — the entire SRE Agent strategy depends on the intelligence you build.
