## Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at PagerDuty sit at the intersection of people leadership and technical execution. You own team delivery, hiring velocity, and engineering culture for a critical product area. PagerDuty's mid-size scale (~1,100 employees) means EMs have broader scope than at larger companies — you'll likely manage 8-12 engineers and own multiple product surfaces. This creates a compelling narrative for negotiation: you're not a layer of management, you're a direct multiplier on the engineering org's output. PagerDuty's post-GA hiring surge means the company is scaling teams rapidly, and experienced EMs who can build and retain high-performing teams are essential. The EM role also carries significant RSU grants, reflecting the company's understanding that engineering leadership turnover is enormously disruptive.

**Level Mapping:** Engineering Manager at PagerDuty maps to M1 (L6 equivalent management track at Google, M1 at Meta, 65 at Microsoft). Typically manages one team with 6-12 direct reports.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. This is the defining product moment for PagerDuty, transforming the company from an incident alerting platform to an intelligent automation platform.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** The SRE Agent GA launch triggers a hiring surge — PagerDuty needs to rapidly scale the engineering teams that build and extend intelligent automation capabilities. Engineering Managers are the linchpin of this scaling effort. You'll be hiring, onboarding, and shipping product with new teams in a high-stakes environment where Zero-Toil Automation adoption is the company's top priority. PagerDuty cannot afford to lose EM candidates because the cost of unfilled EM roles cascades — it delays hiring for the entire team.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Emphasize that post-Feb 4, 2026 GA, PagerDuty is entering a team-scaling phase that depends on strong EMs
- Position your hiring track record as directly accelerating Zero-Toil Automation delivery
- Note that the SRE Agent's intelligent deduction capabilities require specialized engineering teams — and building those teams is your job
- Argue that PD RSUs have clearer upside now that the GA milestone de-risks the AI strategy

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The Team-Builder Premium

> "Post-SRE Agent GA, PagerDuty needs to scale engineering teams rapidly. I've built and scaled teams from 4 to 15 engineers at [previous company], delivering AI-adjacent features on compressed timelines. That team-building experience has direct value for PagerDuty's Zero-Toil Automation roadmap. I'd like my base to reflect the premium on engineering leaders who can hire and ship simultaneously — I'm targeting $240,000."

### Lever 2: The Equity Alignment Lever

> "As an Engineering Manager, my decisions directly impact product velocity and quality — which drives PD stock performance. I want significant equity alignment. I'm requesting $270,000 in PD RSUs over 4 years, reflecting my conviction that the SRE Agent and Zero-Toil Automation will drive meaningful revenue growth."

### Lever 3: The Management Scarcity Lever

> "The market for experienced engineering managers in the AIOps space is extremely tight. I have offers from Datadog at $230,000 base and from a Series C startup at $220,000 base + 0.3% equity. PagerDuty's mission resonates more, but I need the total compensation to be competitive. Can we work on closing the gap?"

### Lever 4: The Relocation & Sign-On Bridge

> "I'm relocating to [San Francisco/Atlanta/London] for this role, which carries $30,000 in one-time costs. Combined with $60,000 in unvested equity I'm leaving behind, I need a sign-on package of at least $45,000 to make this transition work. This is a one-time investment for PagerDuty in securing an engineering leader during your most critical growth phase."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based Engineering Manager role, open at $240,000 base + $270,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $45,000 sign-on. Reference competing EM offers from Datadog or CrowdStrike at $235,000+ base. If PagerDuty's initial offer is $210,000 base + $180,000 RSUs, counter with $225,000 base + $240,000 PD RSUs + $35,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $210,000 base + $200,000 PD RSUs + $30,000 sign-on = ~$390,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $200,000 base + $200,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £135,000 base + £160,000 PD RSUs + £25,000 sign-on.
