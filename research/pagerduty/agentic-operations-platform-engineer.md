## Negotiation DNA

Agentic Operations Platform Engineers at PagerDuty are building the company's future: the Agentic Operations platform that transforms incident management from human-driven reaction to AI-agent-driven autonomous resolution. This role sits at the apex of PagerDuty's engineering organization — you are not building features within the existing product; you are architecting the agent infrastructure, orchestration layer, and decision framework that enables the SRE Agent and its successors to autonomously manage the full incident lifecycle for the world's largest enterprises. PagerDuty's Feb 4, 2026 SRE Agent GA launch proved the concept; the Agentic Operations Platform Engineer builds the scalable, extensible, enterprise-grade agent platform that turns the concept into PagerDuty's competitive moat. The role requires expertise spanning autonomous agent architecture, LLM orchestration, reinforcement learning, distributed systems, and enterprise security — a combination so rare that PagerDuty has created a dedicated 20-25% Agentic AI Premium for the position.

The operational dataset PagerDuty has accumulated — billions of real-world incidents, escalations, resolutions, and post-mortems from over 70% of the Fortune 500 — is the world's most comprehensive training corpus for agentic operations. No competitor has this depth of operational knowledge. As an Agentic Operations Platform Engineer, you are the person who transforms this dataset into agent intelligence — building the reasoning chains, decision frameworks, and autonomous action capabilities that make PagerDuty's agents more capable than any alternative. Your work directly determines whether PagerDuty becomes the platform of record for AI-driven operations or gets displaced by AI-native startups. The compensation reflects this existential importance.

**Level Mapping:** Agentic Operations Platform Engineer at PagerDuty maps to IC4-IC5 (L6-L7 equivalent at Google, E6-E7 at Meta, 65-67 at Microsoft). This is a staff-to-principal level role requiring 8-15+ years of experience with deep expertise in agent systems, ML infrastructure, and distributed platform architecture.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Agentic Operations Platform Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. The SRE Agent is the first product built on the Agentic Operations platform. The Agentic Operations Platform Engineer is responsible for the platform itself — the agent infrastructure, orchestration, and intelligence layer that powers not just the SRE Agent but the entire future portfolio of PagerDuty AI agents.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** PagerDuty's 2026-2028 strategy is to evolve from a single-agent product (SRE Agent) to a multi-agent Agentic Operations platform where specialized AI agents handle different aspects of operations — incident detection, root-cause analysis, remediation, communication, post-mortem generation, and capacity planning. The Agentic Operations Platform Engineer builds the shared infrastructure that makes this multi-agent vision possible: the agent orchestration layer, the inter-agent communication protocol, the shared context and memory systems, the decision-making framework, and the governance guardrails that ensure autonomous agents operate safely at enterprise scale. This is the most architecturally consequential role at PagerDuty, and the company knows that losing Agentic Operations Platform Engineer candidates to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, or AI-native startups would delay the platform roadmap by quarters. Your negotiation leverage is at maximum.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Position yourself as building the agent platform, not just agent features — you are architecting PagerDuty's multi-agent future
- The Feb 4, 2026 SRE Agent GA launch proves the first agent works; argue that the platform for multiple agents is the next strategic priority and the harder engineering challenge
- Cite the operational dataset from 70%+ of the Fortune 500 as the moat that makes PagerDuty's Agentic Operations platform defensible
- Note that OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Datadog, and ServiceNow are all competing for engineers who can build production agent platforms

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The Platform-Not-Feature Lever

> "I'm not joining PagerDuty to build features within the SRE Agent — I'm architecting the Agentic Operations platform that powers the SRE Agent and every future AI agent PagerDuty will build. The agent orchestration layer, inter-agent communication, shared memory systems, and governance framework — this is platform-level infrastructure work that determines PagerDuty's competitive position for the next decade. I need $240,000 base and $260,000 in PD RSUs to reflect the platform-level impact."

### Lever 2: The Agentic AI Talent War Lever

> "I have competing offers from Anthropic at $480,000 total comp and from OpenAI at $460,000 with liquid equity. Engineers who can build production-grade multi-agent platforms for enterprise operations are the single most contested talent pool in AI. I believe PagerDuty's operational dataset from 70% of the Fortune 500 gives the Agentic Operations platform a unique advantage — but the compensation must be competitive with top-tier AI lab offers. I need $260,000 in PD RSUs and a $50,000 sign-on."

### Lever 3: The Multi-Agent Architecture Lever

> "PagerDuty's roadmap calls for specialized AI agents beyond the SRE Agent — agents for detection, root-cause analysis, remediation, communication, post-mortem, and capacity planning. I architect the shared platform that enables this multi-agent ecosystem: orchestration, inter-agent protocols, shared context, and decision frameworks. This multi-agent platform architecture is the hardest unsolved problem in enterprise AI operations, and my experience in [agent systems / multi-agent orchestration / distributed AI platforms] directly addresses it."

### Lever 4: The Equity Upside + Agentic Premium Lever

> "The SRE Agent GA launch validated the single-agent thesis. The Agentic Operations platform — supporting multiple specialized agents operating in concert — will drive the next phase of PagerDuty's revenue growth. As the platform architect, my work directly determines the trajectory. I want maximum equity participation: $260,000 in PD RSUs with a guaranteed annual refresh of 15% of the initial grant. The 20-25% Agentic AI Premium should be at the top of the band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based Agentic Operations Platform Engineer role, open at $240,000 base + $265,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $50,000 sign-on. Reference competing offers from Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google DeepMind at $450,000-$500,000 total comp with liquid equity and research resources. If PagerDuty's initial offer is $200,000 base + $180,000 RSUs, counter with $228,000 base + $240,000 PD RSUs + $42,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $215,000 base + $200,000 PD RSUs + $35,000 sign-on = ~$430,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $200,000 base + $200,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £140,000 base + £145,000 PD RSUs + £30,000 sign-on. Agentic Operations Platform Engineers have the strongest negotiation position of any role at PagerDuty — the entire multi-agent future depends on the platform you architect.
