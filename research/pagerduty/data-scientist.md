## Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at PagerDuty sit at the core of the company's AIOps strategy. PagerDuty processes billions of events, and data scientists build the models that detect anomalies, reduce noise, correlate incidents, and power the company's intelligent automation features. The role blends applied ML, statistical analysis, and product analytics — you'll work with massive-scale operational data that few companies outside of hyperscalers can match. PagerDuty's data science org is a competitive advantage, and the company invests accordingly. With the company's strategic pivot toward AI-driven incident resolution, data scientists are no longer a support function — they're building the core product.

**Level Mapping:** Data Scientist at PagerDuty maps to IC3 data science (L5 equivalent at Google, IC5 at Meta, 62-63 at Microsoft). Typically 4-8 years of experience with strong applied ML and statistical modeling skills.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. The SRE Agent's intelligence is built on models and data pipelines that data scientists own — making this role central to PagerDuty's product future.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** Data Scientists are the engine behind the SRE Agent's ability to intelligently deduce incident resolution steps. The Feb 4, 2026 GA launch validates the model architecture, but scaling accuracy, expanding to new incident types, and reducing false positives requires continuous data science investment. PagerDuty's Zero-Toil Automation vision depends on models that are accurate enough for autonomous action — and building that trust requires world-class data science. If you have experience with anomaly detection, time-series modeling, or LLM-powered agents, you're exactly the profile PagerDuty is competing for.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Position your ML/statistical modeling experience as directly powering the SRE Agent's intelligent deduction capabilities
- The Feb 4, 2026 GA milestone proves the models work — argue that improving them further requires specialized data science talent worth a premium
- Frame Zero-Toil Automation as a data-quality problem that you're uniquely equipped to solve
- Note that Datadog, New Relic, and Splunk are all competing for the same pool of AIOps data scientists

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The Model-Is-the-Product Lever

> "At PagerDuty, the data science models ARE the product. The SRE Agent's intelligent deduction capabilities — the core of Zero-Toil Automation — are built on the models I'd be developing and improving. This isn't analytics work; it's product-core ML. I'm looking for compensation that reflects the direct product impact: $205,000 base and $180,000 in PD RSUs."

### Lever 2: The Specialized Talent Scarcity Lever

> "Data scientists with experience in operational AI — anomaly detection, time-series at scale, LLM-powered agents — are among the hardest profiles to hire. I have competing offers from Datadog at $200,000 base and from a well-funded AI startup at $195,000 base + 0.2% equity. I prefer PagerDuty's domain and the SRE Agent opportunity, but I need the compensation to reflect my market value."

### Lever 3: The Equity Upside Lever

> "The SRE Agent GA launch positions PagerDuty's stock for meaningful upside. As a data scientist directly improving the models that power Zero-Toil Automation, my work will drive expansion revenue. I'd like to increase my RSU grant to $180,000 in PD RSUs — I want my compensation closely tied to the outcomes I'm driving."

### Lever 4: The Sign-On & Transition Bridge

> "I'm leaving $45,000 in unvested equity at my current employer, plus I'll need to relocate. A sign-on bonus of $35,000 would make the transition clean and let me focus on ramping quickly post-SRE Agent GA. This is a modest cost to secure a data scientist who can immediately contribute to PagerDuty's AI capabilities."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based Data Scientist role, open at $205,000 base + $180,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $35,000 sign-on. Reference competing offers from Datadog or a well-funded AI startup at $195,000-$205,000 base. If PagerDuty's initial offer is $175,000 base + $120,000 RSUs, counter with $195,000 base + $160,000 PD RSUs + $28,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $180,000 base + $130,000 PD RSUs + $22,000 sign-on = ~$320,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $170,000 base + $130,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £110,000 base + £100,000 PD RSUs + £18,000 sign-on.
