## Negotiation DNA

Staff Software Engineers at PagerDuty are force multipliers. You set technical direction for entire product areas, drive cross-team architecture, and are expected to influence the company's engineering culture. At this level, PagerDuty's comp structure shifts heavily toward equity — RSU grants can represent 40-50% of total compensation. The company competes directly with FAANG, Datadog, CrowdStrike, and well-funded startups for Staff-level talent, and losing a Staff candidate is acutely painful. PagerDuty's org is lean enough that each Staff engineer has outsized impact, which gives you significant negotiation leverage. Your negotiation should be framed around strategic impact, not just engineering output.

**Level Mapping:** Staff Software Engineer at PagerDuty maps to IC4 (L6 equivalent at Google, E6 at Meta, 65-66 at Microsoft). Typically 10-15+ years of experience with demonstrated technical leadership across teams.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. This represents PagerDuty's most significant platform shift: from a reactive incident management tool to an intelligent, autonomous operations platform.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** Staff Engineers are the architects of the SRE Agent's future. The GA launch on Feb 4, 2026 was just the beginning — PagerDuty must now scale the intelligent deduction engine, expand Zero-Toil Automation to new domains (security, change management, capacity planning), and ensure enterprise-grade reliability. These are Staff-level problems. PagerDuty knows that a single Staff hire can accelerate the roadmap by quarters. This urgency, combined with a thin market for engineers who understand both AI/ML and incident management at scale, gives you extraordinary leverage.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Position yourself as someone who can own the technical vision for SRE Agent's next generation
- The Feb 4, 2026 GA milestone means PagerDuty is past the "will it work?" phase — argue that PD RSUs now have a clearer risk/reward profile
- Reference Zero-Toil Automation as the thesis that drives PagerDuty's TAM expansion
- Note that Staff-level hires are the hardest to replace — PagerDuty's cost of a missed hire is measured in quarters of roadmap delay

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The Strategic Architect Lever

> "At the Staff level, I'm not filling a role — I'm shaping PagerDuty's technical trajectory. With the SRE Agent now GA, the next challenge is scaling intelligent automation across the full incident lifecycle. I bring the architectural experience to lead that effort. I'd like my compensation to reflect the strategic nature of this hire — specifically, a base of $260,000 and an RSU grant of $400,000 in PD RSUs."

### Lever 2: The Concentrated Equity Bet

> "I believe the SRE Agent GA launch positions PD stock for meaningful upside over the next 4 years. Zero-Toil Automation is a genuinely differentiated value prop. I want to make a concentrated bet — I'd accept $240,000 base if we can increase the RSU grant to $420,000 in PD RSUs. I want significant alignment between my compensation and PagerDuty's success."

### Lever 3: The FAANG Counteroffer Lever

> "I have a Staff offer from Google at $290,000 base + $500,000 RSUs. I'm drawn to PagerDuty because of the SRE Agent opportunity and the outsized impact a Staff engineer can have at your scale. But the comp gap is real — I need PagerDuty to close it to a point where the decision is about mission, not money."

### Lever 4: The Retention Risk Lever

> "My current employer is offering a $150,000 retention package to keep me. I'm committed to making a move, but I need a sign-on bonus and RSU grant that makes leaving financially rational. A $50,000 sign-on plus front-loaded RSU vesting would bridge the gap — this is a one-time cost for a Staff hire who will drive years of platform value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based Staff Software Engineer role, open at $265,000 base + $400,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $55,000 sign-on. Reference a competing Staff offer from Google, Datadog, or CrowdStrike at $280,000+ base. If PagerDuty's initial offer is $235,000 base + $280,000 RSUs, counter with $250,000 base + $360,000 PD RSUs + $45,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $240,000 base + $300,000 PD RSUs + $35,000 sign-on = ~$510,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $220,000 base + $280,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £150,000 base + £240,000 PD RSUs + £35,000 sign-on.
