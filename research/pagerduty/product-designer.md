## Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at PagerDuty design mission-critical interfaces used during high-stress incidents by SREs, DevOps engineers, and on-call responders. The design bar is exceptionally high — every pixel matters when a customer's production system is down at 3 AM. PagerDuty's design org is small but influential, with designers embedded directly in cross-functional product teams and given significant autonomy. The company's expansion into AI-driven automation creates entirely new design challenges: how do you build trust in an AI agent that autonomously resolves incidents? How do you design for transparency and override controls? These are novel UX problems that make PagerDuty an unusually compelling design opportunity — and give you negotiation leverage as someone who can solve them.

**Level Mapping:** Product Designer at PagerDuty maps to IC3 design (L5 equivalent design at Google, IC5 at Meta, 62-63 at Microsoft). Typically 4-8 years of design experience with a strong portfolio in enterprise SaaS or developer tools.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. This fundamentally changes the design challenge at PagerDuty from "how do humans manage incidents?" to "how do humans trust and collaborate with an intelligent agent?"

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** The SRE Agent's GA launch on Feb 4, 2026 creates a wave of new design work. PagerDuty needs designers who can craft experiences for human-AI collaboration — the interfaces where operators review the agent's intelligent deductions, approve automated actions, and override when necessary. Zero-Toil Automation only works if humans trust the agent, and trust is fundamentally a design problem. Designers with experience in AI-powered products, transparency patterns, or complex workflow design are uniquely valuable to PagerDuty right now.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Frame your experience in AI/ML product design or complex enterprise UX as directly enabling Zero-Toil Automation adoption
- Reference the Feb 4, 2026 SRE Agent GA as proof that PagerDuty has novel, high-impact design problems to solve
- Position the intelligent deduction UI as a design challenge that requires specialized talent — not a commodity skill
- Argue that design quality directly impacts SRE Agent adoption and, therefore, PagerDuty's revenue

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The AI-UX Specialist Premium

> "The SRE Agent's intelligent automation capabilities need exceptional design to build user trust. I've designed AI-powered interfaces at [previous company] — explainability layers, confidence indicators, human-in-the-loop controls. This is exactly the UX challenge PagerDuty faces with Zero-Toil Automation. I'm looking for a base of $190,000 to reflect this specialized AI-UX design expertise."

### Lever 2: The Impact-Per-Designer Lever

> "PagerDuty's design org is lean — each designer has outsized impact on product quality and customer experience. The SRE Agent's GA launch means there's a wave of new surfaces to design. My work will directly influence how enterprises adopt intelligent automation. I'd like my RSU grant increased to $140,000 in PD RSUs to reflect that impact."

### Lever 3: The Design Talent War Lever

> "Enterprise SaaS designers who can work on AI-powered products are in extremely high demand. I have a competing offer from Figma at $185,000 base and from Datadog at $180,000 base. PagerDuty's SRE Agent design challenge is more interesting, but I need the comp to be competitive. Can we close the base gap and increase the RSU grant?"

### Lever 4: The Portfolio-to-Revenue Bridge

> "My portfolio includes [specific AI/enterprise design work] that directly maps to PagerDuty's Zero-Toil Automation UX challenges. Bringing this experience means faster iteration on the SRE Agent's interface — which accelerates adoption and revenue. A $25,000 sign-on bonus is a small investment to secure a designer who can hit the ground running post-GA."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based Product Designer role, open at $190,000 base + $145,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $28,000 sign-on. Reference competing design offers from Figma, Datadog, or Atlassian at $180,000-$190,000 base. If PagerDuty's initial offer is $165,000 base + $100,000 RSUs, counter with $180,000 base + $130,000 PD RSUs + $22,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $170,000 base + $110,000 PD RSUs + $18,000 sign-on = ~$295,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $155,000 base + $110,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £100,000 base + £85,000 PD RSUs + £15,000 sign-on.
