## Negotiation DNA

Product Managers at PagerDuty define what gets built, for whom, and why. The role carries significant cross-functional influence — PMs work directly with engineering, design, data science, sales, and customer success to drive product outcomes. PagerDuty's PM org is lean, meaning each PM owns substantial surface area and is expected to make high-impact prioritization decisions. This scope creates natural negotiation leverage: you're not one of fifty PMs fighting for visibility — you're one of a handful directly shaping the product roadmap. PagerDuty's transition to an AI-powered platform also means PM candidates with experience in ML-driven products, developer tools, or automation platforms command a premium.

**Level Mapping:** Product Manager at PagerDuty maps to mid-level PM (L5 PM at Google, IC5 at Meta, 62-63 at Microsoft). Typically 4-8 years of PM experience with ownership of a major product area.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. This launch redefines PagerDuty's product strategy and opens entirely new product surfaces that need PM leadership.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** The SRE Agent GA launch on Feb 4, 2026 creates new PM roles and expands existing ones. PagerDuty needs PMs who can define the roadmap for intelligent automation — how the SRE Agent learns, what workflows it automates, how Zero-Toil Automation is packaged and priced. These are high-leverage PM decisions that directly impact PagerDuty's revenue trajectory. If you have experience in AI/ML product management or developer tooling, your skill set maps directly to PagerDuty's highest-priority product investments.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Position your AI/ML or developer tool PM experience as directly relevant to extending the SRE Agent post-GA
- Reference the Feb 4, 2026 GA milestone to show PagerDuty's commitment — this isn't a science project, it's a shipped product
- Argue that Zero-Toil Automation opens new pricing/packaging opportunities that a strong PM will capture
- Note that PagerDuty competes with Datadog, ServiceNow, and Atlassian for PMs who understand intelligent automation

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The AI Product Expertise Premium

> "With the SRE Agent now GA, PagerDuty needs PMs who can define the roadmap for intelligent automation products. I've shipped AI-powered features at [previous company] and understand the unique challenges of PM'ing ML-driven products — data quality, feedback loops, user trust. This expertise is directly applicable to Zero-Toil Automation. I'm looking for a base of $200,000 to reflect this specialized skill set."

### Lever 2: The Revenue Impact Lever

> "The SRE Agent's GA launch creates new monetization opportunities — usage-based pricing, tiered automation, enterprise add-ons. As PM, I'll directly influence how these are packaged and positioned. That's a revenue-impact role, not a feature-shipping role. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect this — $180,000 in PD RSUs over 4 years, aligning my compensation with the revenue upside I'll drive."

### Lever 3: The Competing PM Offer Lever

> "I have a PM offer from Atlassian at $195,000 base and from Datadog at $190,000 base. Both are strong product orgs, but PagerDuty's SRE Agent opportunity is more compelling. I need the total comp to close the gap — can we increase the base to $200,000 and add $20,000 to the RSU grant?"

### Lever 4: The Sign-On Acceleration

> "I'm forfeiting $50,000 in unvested equity by leaving my current role. A sign-on bonus of $35,000 would bridge most of that gap and make the decision straightforward. This is a modest one-time cost compared to the value a PM will drive for the SRE Agent product line."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based Product Manager role, open at $200,000 base + $180,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $35,000 sign-on. Reference competing PM offers from Datadog or Atlassian at $190,000-$200,000 base. If PagerDuty's initial offer is $175,000 base + $120,000 RSUs, counter with $190,000 base + $160,000 PD RSUs + $30,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $180,000 base + $130,000 PD RSUs + $20,000 sign-on = ~$325,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $170,000 base + $130,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £105,000 base + £100,000 PD RSUs + £18,000 sign-on.
