## Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at PagerDuty drive the execution of the company's most complex, cross-functional initiatives. TPMs own the "how" and "when" — coordinating engineering, product, design, infrastructure, and go-to-market teams to ship on time and on spec. PagerDuty's current product transformation, from incident notification to intelligent automation, creates a higher density of cross-functional programs than any prior era. TPMs who can manage ambiguity, drive alignment across competing priorities, and ship reliably are at a premium. The role carries meaningful equity because PagerDuty recognizes that execution velocity — which TPMs directly control — is a key differentiator.

**Level Mapping:** Technical Program Manager at PagerDuty maps to mid-senior TPM (L5-L6 equivalent TPM at Google, IC5 at Meta, 63-65 at Microsoft). Typically 5-10 years of experience with a track record of shipping complex technical programs.

### PagerDuty SRE Agent & Zero-Toil Automation Lever

On **Feb 4, 2026**, PagerDuty launched the **SRE Agent** to **General Availability (GA)** — an AI agent that intelligently deduces next steps for troubleshooting, enabling **Zero-Toil Automation**. The GA launch itself was a massive cross-functional program — and the post-GA roadmap is even more complex.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:** The SRE Agent's GA launch on Feb 4, 2026 was just the first milestone. PagerDuty's post-GA roadmap includes enterprise-scale deployment, new intelligent deduction domains, regulatory compliance, and international expansion of Zero-Toil Automation capabilities. Each of these is a major cross-functional program that needs a TPM to drive. PagerDuty is entering its most program-intensive era, and the demand for TPMs who can coordinate AI product delivery at enterprise scale far exceeds supply.

**How to use this in negotiation:**
- Frame the SRE Agent post-GA roadmap as a portfolio of high-complexity programs that require experienced TPM leadership
- Reference the Feb 4, 2026 GA milestone as proof of PagerDuty's execution capability — and argue that sustaining that velocity requires dedicated TPM investment
- Position Zero-Toil Automation as a program with regulatory, security, and international dimensions that amplify TPM value
- Note that AI-product TPMs are scarce — the intelligent automation space requires TPMs who understand both ML delivery and enterprise requirements

## 4 Global Levers

### Lever 1: The Program Complexity Premium

> "PagerDuty's post-SRE Agent GA roadmap is a portfolio of highly complex, cross-functional programs — scaling intelligent automation, enterprise compliance, international deployment of Zero-Toil Automation. I've managed programs of this complexity at [previous company], shipping AI features to enterprise customers on tight timelines. My base should reflect the scope: I'm targeting $210,000."

### Lever 2: The Execution Velocity Lever

> "TPMs directly control shipping velocity. At [previous company], I cut delivery timelines by 30% on a comparable AI product launch. For PagerDuty, that kind of acceleration on the SRE Agent roadmap translates directly to faster revenue capture. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect this value: $180,000 in PD RSUs over 4 years."

### Lever 3: The Competing TPM Offer Lever

> "I have a TPM offer from Google at $205,000 base + $280,000 RSUs and from Datadog at $195,000 base. PagerDuty's SRE Agent program is a once-in-a-career opportunity to lead a category-defining product launch. But I need the compensation to narrow the gap with my alternatives — can we increase the base and RSU components?"

### Lever 4: The Immediate Impact Lever

> "I can start contributing from day one because I've managed AI product delivery programs with the same stakeholder complexity PagerDuty faces post-GA. A sign-on bonus of $35,000 bridges the gap from my current compensation and eliminates any financial friction from an immediate start date."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** For a San Francisco-based TPM role, open at $210,000 base + $185,000 in PD RSUs (4yr vest) + $35,000 sign-on. Reference competing TPM offers from Google or Datadog at $200,000-$210,000 base. If PagerDuty's initial offer is $185,000 base + $130,000 RSUs, counter with $200,000 base + $165,000 PD RSUs + $30,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $190,000 base + $140,000 PD RSUs + $22,000 sign-on = ~$335,000 Year 1 TC. For Atlanta, target $175,000 base + $135,000 PD RSUs. For London, target £115,000 base + £100,000 PD RSUs + £18,000 sign-on.
