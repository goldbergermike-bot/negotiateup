**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Mastercard shape how billions of people interact with the global payments network — from the checkout flow a consumer sees on their phone to the merchant dashboard that processes $28B+ in annual transaction volume. This is design at a scale and consequence level that few companies match: every interaction pattern must work across 210+ countries, dozens of languages, multiple authentication modalities, and regulatory frameworks that vary by jurisdiction. A Product Designer here is not decorating interfaces — they are defining the trust signals, authentication ceremonies, and credential management experiences that determine whether 3.3 billion cardholders feel safe transacting.

The strategic moment amplifies this role's value. Mastercard's Digital Identity Wallets initiative requires designers who can create intuitive experiences for biometric enrollment, credential storage, and identity verification — flows that must feel effortless while providing bank-grade security. The Agent Pay Acceptance Framework introduces an entirely new design challenge: how do humans review, approve, and monitor transactions that AI agents initiate on their behalf? And the Trust Orchestrator positioning means Mastercard's design system must extend to developer-facing experiences — API documentation, integration wizards, and sandbox environments. Designers who understand payment UX, identity authentication flows, and developer experience are exceptionally rare.

### Digital Identity Wallets — The Trust Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Pay Transparency Design:** "The Agent Pay Acceptance Framework creates a fundamentally new UX challenge: designing interfaces that give humans visibility and control over AI-agent transactions. This requires rethinking notification patterns, approval flows, and spending dashboards for autonomous commerce. I've designed trust and transparency experiences for autonomous systems, and I understand how to make AI-driven actions feel safe without being intrusive. I'm targeting a base of $175K to reflect the design innovation premium this role demands."

**Lever 2 — Digital Identity Wallets Credential UX:** "The Digital Identity Wallets experience is the front door to Mastercard's Trust Orchestrator platform. How users enroll biometrics, store credentials, and share verified identity attributes will determine adoption rates across the entire ecosystem. I've designed identity verification and credential management flows that achieved 90%+ completion rates — I'd like the RSU grant at $130K over four years to reflect the direct revenue impact of wallet adoption."

**Lever 3 — Biometric Authentication Ceremony Design:** "Mastercard's biometric authentication leadership depends on experiences that feel natural and trustworthy — facial recognition prompts, fingerprint enrollment flows, and behavioral biometric consent patterns. I've shipped biometric UX at scale with accessibility compliance across multiple markets. I'd like a $15K sign-on bonus to bridge the gap between my current offer and comparable design roles at Apple Pay and Google."

**Lever 4 — Trust Orchestrator Developer Experience:** "The Trust Orchestrator platform needs a designer who can create the developer-facing experience — API documentation, integration flows, sandbox tools — that makes Mastercard's identity and payment APIs the easiest to adopt. Developer experience design is a specialized skill that drives platform adoption. I'd like a guaranteed annual portfolio review with a path to Senior Designer within 18 months, including a $20K base adjustment at promotion tied to Digital Identity Wallets platform metrics."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $180K base / $140K RSU (4yr) for New York, targeting $350K total comp. Lead with the Agent Pay design challenge: "Designing human oversight for AI-agent commerce is a design problem that didn't exist two years ago — Mastercard needs a designer who has thought deeply about trust, transparency, and autonomous system UX." If the band is tight, push for a $15K sign-on and accelerated promotion path to Senior Designer. Your accept-at floor is $280K total comp ($150K base, $100K RSU, $30K bonus). Frame around the Digital Identity Wallets adoption imperative: "The Trust Orchestrator vision succeeds or fails based on design — if the wallet experience isn't intuitive, no amount of engineering infrastructure matters."
