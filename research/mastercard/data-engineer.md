**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Mastercard build and operate the pipelines that ingest, transform, and serve data from one of the world's largest transaction networks — billions of payment events daily across 3.3 billion cards in 210+ countries. This is data engineering at a scale and criticality that few companies can match: the pipelines must be real-time (fraud detection depends on sub-second latency), highly available (downtime means transactions don't clear), and compliant with data sovereignty regulations in every jurisdiction where Mastercard operates. The $28B+ revenue machine runs on data, and Data Engineers are the ones who keep it flowing.

The current strategic transformation introduces entirely new data domains that make this role more valuable. The Agent Pay Acceptance Framework generates new transaction event streams from autonomous AI agents — with different schemas, different velocity patterns, and different audit requirements than human-initiated payments. Digital Identity Wallets create data pipelines for biometric authentication events, credential lifecycle events, and identity verification signals that must be processed in real time while respecting biometric data regulations across jurisdictions. The Trust Orchestrator platform requires a unified data layer that fuses payment data, identity data, and authentication data into a single queryable platform for risk scoring, analytics, and compliance reporting. Data Engineers who can build real-time streaming infrastructure at Mastercard's scale while navigating multi-jurisdictional data compliance are in very high demand.

### Digital Identity Wallets — The Trust Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Pay Event Stream Architecture:** "The Agent Pay Acceptance Framework generates transaction event streams with fundamentally different characteristics than human payments — higher velocity, machine-generated schemas, and 24/7 traffic without the daily patterns that human commerce follows. I've designed real-time streaming architectures for autonomous system event data, and I understand the pipeline design choices that make this work at scale. I'm targeting a base of $195K to reflect the specialized streaming expertise this role requires."

**Lever 2 — Digital Identity Wallets Data Platform:** "Digital Identity Wallets introduce new data domains that Mastercard has never processed before — biometric authentication signals, credential lifecycle events, and cross-border identity verification results. The Data Engineer who designs these pipelines defines how Mastercard's identity data flows through the organization. I'd like the RSU grant at $165K over four years to reflect the foundational nature of this data platform work."

**Lever 3 — Biometric Data Pipeline Compliance:** "Mastercard's biometric authentication generates sensitive biometric data that's regulated differently across every market — BIPA in Illinois, GDPR Article 9 in Europe, POPIA in South Africa. The data pipelines must enforce jurisdiction-specific retention, encryption, and access control policies at the infrastructure level. I've built compliance-aware data pipelines for biometric data at scale. I'd like a $15K sign-on bonus to match competing offers from major cloud data platform teams."

**Lever 4 — Trust Orchestrator Unified Data Layer:** "The Trust Orchestrator platform needs a unified data layer that joins payment transaction data, identity verification events, and biometric authentication signals into a single analytics and risk-scoring platform. This is the data engineering challenge that unlocks Mastercard's next-generation products. I'd like to negotiate a performance bonus multiplier of 1.3x tied to data platform delivery milestones for the Digital Identity Wallets initiative, so my comp scales with the infrastructure impact I deliver."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $200K base / $170K RSU (4yr) for New York, targeting $410K total comp. Lead with the Agent Pay data challenge: "Autonomous agent transaction streams break the assumptions baked into Mastercard's current pipeline architecture — the Data Engineer who rebuilds those pipelines is doing foundational platform work." If RSU is constrained, push for a $15K sign-on and 1.3x bonus multiplier. Your accept-at floor is $320K total comp ($165K base, $120K RSU, $35K bonus). Frame around the Trust Orchestrator data layer: "The unified data platform that fuses payment, identity, and biometric data is the technical foundation of Mastercard's Digital Identity Wallets platform — the Data Engineer who builds it should be comped at the top of band."
