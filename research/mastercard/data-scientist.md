**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Mastercard sit on one of the most valuable proprietary datasets in the world — billions of transactions across 3.3 billion cards, spanning 210+ countries, with decades of historical depth. This is not generic data science; Mastercard's $28B+ revenue is built on the intelligence extracted from transaction flows, and Data Scientists here build the models that detect fraud, price risk, forecast merchant revenue, and optimize network routing. The outputs of this work directly impact Mastercard's bottom line and the security of every transaction on the network.

The current strategic landscape makes Data Scientists even more critical. The Agent Pay Acceptance Framework requires entirely new fraud detection and risk scoring models — when an AI agent initiates a transaction, the behavioral signals are fundamentally different from human-initiated payments, and traditional fraud models fail. Digital Identity Wallets generate new data streams around biometric authentication patterns, credential usage, and identity verification events that need to be modeled for both product optimization and security. The Trust Orchestrator vision requires Data Scientists who can build the intelligence layer that ties payment signals, identity signals, and authentication signals together into a unified risk and trust score. This combination of payment domain expertise and modern ML/AI skills gives Data Scientists substantial negotiation leverage.

### Digital Identity Wallets — The Trust Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Pay Fraud Model Innovation:** "The Agent Pay Acceptance Framework breaks traditional fraud models because AI agents don't exhibit human behavioral patterns — there's no typing rhythm, no geolocation consistency, no session-based fraud signals. Building fraud detection for autonomous commerce requires a Data Scientist who can design new feature engineering approaches from first principles. I've built anomaly detection systems for non-human actors, and I'm targeting a base of $200K to reflect the model innovation this role requires."

**Lever 2 — Digital Identity Wallets Trust Scoring:** "Digital Identity Wallets create a new data surface for Mastercard — biometric authentication confidence scores, credential verification events, cross-platform identity usage patterns. The Data Scientist who builds the trust scoring models for this data will define how Mastercard differentiates its identity platform. I'd like the RSU grant at $170K over four years, reflecting the proprietary IP I'll be creating in identity trust models."

**Lever 3 — Biometric Authentication Signal Analysis:** "Mastercard's biometric authentication generates high-dimensional signal data — facial geometry, fingerprint minutiae patterns, behavioral biometric streams. Building models that distinguish genuine users from spoofing attempts while minimizing false rejections directly impacts transaction approval rates and revenue. My experience in biometric signal processing and liveness detection is directly applicable. I'd like a $20K sign-on bonus to match competing offers from FAANG ML research teams."

**Lever 4 — Trust Orchestrator Intelligence Layer:** "The Trust Orchestrator platform needs an intelligence layer that fuses payment data, identity data, and authentication data into real-time risk decisions. This is the kind of cross-domain modeling that creates defensible competitive advantage — and it requires a Data Scientist who can work across multiple data modalities. I'd like to negotiate a performance bonus multiplier of 1.5x in year one, tied to model deployment milestones for the Digital Identity Wallets trust scoring system."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $205K base / $175K RSU (4yr) for New York, targeting $422K total comp. Lead with the Agent Pay fraud model challenge: "Traditional fraud detection doesn't work for AI-agent transactions — Mastercard needs Data Scientists who can design detection systems for autonomous commerce from scratch." If RSU is constrained, push for a $20K sign-on and 1.5x bonus multiplier in year one. Your accept-at floor is $340K total comp ($170K base, $130K RSU, $40K bonus). Frame every counter through the Trust Orchestrator lens: "The intelligence layer that fuses payment, identity, and biometric data is the moat around Mastercard's Digital Identity Wallets platform — the Data Scientist who builds it deserves above-band comp."
