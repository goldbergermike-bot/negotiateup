**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Mastercard build the intelligent systems that protect, optimize, and differentiate a payment network processing billions of transactions across 3.3 billion cards globally. This is not research for research's sake — every model ships to production, every algorithm operates at planetary scale, and the outputs directly impact $28B+ in annual revenue. Mastercard's ML/AI Engineers build fraud detection models that evaluate transactions in under 50 milliseconds, recommendation systems that optimize payment routing across global networks, and risk scoring engines that banks and merchants depend on for real-time decisioning. The proprietary dataset — decades of transaction history across 210+ countries — is one of the most valuable training corpora in the world, and ML/AI Engineers are the ones who turn it into competitive advantage.

The current strategic moment is a golden age for ML/AI Engineers at Mastercard. The Agent Pay Acceptance Framework requires entirely new ML models: when AI agents initiate transactions, traditional behavioral fraud signals disappear, and new detection approaches must be built from first principles. Digital Identity Wallets depend on ML for biometric authentication — facial recognition, fingerprint matching, liveness detection, and behavioral biometric models that must be accurate, fast, and resistant to adversarial attacks. The Trust Orchestrator vision requires ML/AI Engineers who can build unified risk and trust scoring models that fuse payment signals, identity signals, and authentication signals into real-time decisions. Engineers who combine deep ML expertise with payment domain knowledge and identity/biometric systems experience are among the most sought-after professionals in technology.

### Digital Identity Wallets — The Trust Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Pay Anomaly Detection Innovation:** "The Agent Pay Acceptance Framework renders Mastercard's existing fraud models partially obsolete — AI agents don't have typing patterns, don't exhibit geolocation drift, and don't show the behavioral signals that current fraud detection relies on. Building anomaly detection for autonomous commerce requires an ML Engineer who can design new feature spaces and detection architectures from scratch. I've built anomaly detection systems for non-human actor environments, and I'm targeting a base of $230K to reflect the model innovation this initiative requires."

**Lever 2 — Digital Identity Wallets Biometric ML Pipeline:** "Digital Identity Wallets depend on ML models for every authentication event — facial recognition with anti-spoofing, fingerprint matching with liveness detection, behavioral biometric profiling for continuous authentication. These models must operate at sub-100ms latency, maintain false acceptance rates below 0.001%, and resist adversarial attacks. I've shipped production biometric ML systems with these performance characteristics. I'd like the RSU package at $240K over four years to reflect the IP value of the biometric models I'll be building."

**Lever 3 — Biometric Authentication Model Robustness:** "Mastercard's biometric authentication leadership depends on ML models that work across demographic groups, lighting conditions, device types, and adversarial attack vectors. Building demographically fair, robust biometric models that maintain accuracy under real-world conditions is one of the hardest problems in applied ML. I've published research on fairness-aware biometric systems and have production deployment experience. I'd like a $30K sign-on bonus to match competing offers from DeepMind and Meta AI Research."

**Lever 4 — Trust Orchestrator Unified Risk Scoring:** "The Trust Orchestrator platform needs an ML-powered unified risk scoring engine that fuses payment transaction features, identity verification confidence scores, and biometric authentication signals into a single real-time trust decision. This is a multi-modal, multi-domain ML system that creates Mastercard's core competitive moat. I'd like to negotiate accelerated RSU vesting — 30% in year one — plus a guaranteed refresher review at 12 months with a minimum $60K incremental grant, because the Trust Orchestrator risk model I build in the first year will define the platform's intelligence layer for years to come."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $235K base / $240K RSU (4yr) for New York, targeting $530K total comp. Lead with the Agent Pay anomaly detection challenge: "Traditional fraud ML doesn't work when the transacting entity is an AI agent — Mastercard needs ML Engineers who can design detection systems for autonomous commerce from first principles." Benchmark against Google L5 MLE ($450K-$600K) and Meta IC5 MLE ($400K-$550K) to establish market rate. If RSU is capped, push for a $30K sign-on and accelerated vesting (30/25/25/20). Your accept-at floor is $430K total comp ($195K base, $190K RSU, $45K bonus). Frame every counter through the Digital Identity Wallets biometric lens: "The biometric ML models powering Trust Orchestrator authentication are the product — the ML Engineer who builds them is creating the core IP that Mastercard's identity platform monetizes."
