### Software Engineer | Juniper Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI-Native Networking | HPE Unified Sales Comp | Mist AI Platform | Networking Infrastructure Tier

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Sunnyvale | $120K–$155K | $30K–$50K | 8–12% | $168K–$218K |
| Westford (MA) | $110K–$142K | $28K–$45K | 8–12% | $158K–$200K |
| Remote US | $105K–$138K | $25K–$42K | 8–12% | $158K–$195K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Juniper's Software Engineers are the foundation of the AI-native networking stack that powers Mist AI and the broader HPE networking portfolio. With the January 2026 HPE acquisition complete and unified sales compensation now in effect, SWEs at Juniper operate at the intersection of enterprise networking and AI-driven automation — a combination that few companies can match. The Mist AI platform's demonstrated 90% reduction in IT support tickets proves that code written by Juniper engineers directly translates to massive customer ROI, making this a high-leverage negotiation position.

**HPE Unified Sales Comp — The Synergy Accelerator Premium**

With HPE's acquisition of Juniper finalized and the unified sales compensation structure launched in January 2026, Software Engineers have a unique window to negotiate from a position of strength. The unified comp plan merges HPE's traditionally generous benefits and stock programs with Juniper's competitive base salaries and networking-focused equity grants. Candidates should position themselves as "Synergy Accelerators" — engineers who don't just write code but actively drive the HPE-Juniper integration forward. The Mist AI platform's 90% ticket reduction for customers is concrete proof that Juniper's AI-native approach delivers measurable operational savings, and the engineers who build and maintain this platform deserve premium compensation that reflects that value. Negotiate by referencing both HPE's and Juniper's legacy pay bands and selecting the higher of the two for each comp component — base from whichever was higher, RSU grants from whichever was more generous, and bonus targets from the more favorable structure. Integration periods historically create comp band ambiguity; use this to your advantage by anchoring to the top of both ranges.

**Global Levers**

1. **Mist AI Impact Quantification:** "The Mist AI platform I'll be contributing to has demonstrated a 90% reduction in IT support tickets for enterprise customers — I'd like my compensation to reflect the direct revenue impact of this technology."
2. **HPE-Juniper Band Arbitrage:** "Given the unified compensation structure, I'd like to understand how my offer maps against both legacy HPE and legacy Juniper bands, and I'd expect to be positioned at the higher of the two."
3. **AI-Native Networking Scarcity:** "Engineers with combined networking protocol and AI/ML experience are exceptionally scarce — my background in both positions me to accelerate the integration roadmap."
4. **Retention Through Integration:** "Post-acquisition retention is critical, and I'd like to discuss a sign-on or retention grant that reflects my commitment to seeing the integration through its first two years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm very excited about the Juniper/HPE mission and the Mist AI platform. I have a competing offer at $195K total comp from [Cisco/Arista/Palo Alto]. Given the integration opportunity and my networking + AI background, I'm looking for $210K–$218K total comp, with at least $145K base and $45K in RSUs over four years. I can accept at $195K total comp if we can structure a $15K sign-on bonus to bridge the gap. I'd like to finalize this week."
