**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Juniper/HPE are responsible for making the most complex networking technology in the enterprise world feel intuitive, actionable, and delightful. The Mist AI platform's ability to deliver a 90% ticket reduction is not just an engineering achievement — it is fundamentally a design achievement, because the AI-driven insights are only valuable if network administrators can understand and act on them through well-crafted interfaces. With the January 2026 HPE acquisition complete, Product Designers face the critical challenge of unifying the UX across Juniper Mist, HPE Aruba Central, and the combined management console, making this one of the most consequential design roles in enterprise tech.

**HPE Unified Sales Comp — The Synergy Accelerator Premium**

Product Designers are uniquely positioned as "Synergy Accelerators" because the visible manifestation of the HPE-Juniper integration is the unified user experience. Every customer interaction with the combined platform runs through the design layer — dashboards, workflows, alerts, and AI-driven recommendations all need to be redesigned for the merged product. The unified sales compensation structure launched in January 2026 means that sales teams are now selling a unified story, and the design of that unified product directly impacts deal velocity and customer satisfaction. The Mist AI 90% ticket reduction is a design outcome as much as an engineering one — the AI insights reduce tickets only because the interface makes them actionable. Negotiate by referencing this direct line from design quality to customer ROI. Historically, HPE offered slightly higher equity for design roles, while Juniper's base salaries were more competitive for designers focused on networking products. Push for the best of both: Juniper's base and HPE's equity. If you have a portfolio showing enterprise networking UX work, you hold rare skills that command a scarcity premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **Unified UX Ownership:** "The unified Juniper-HPE product experience will be defined by the design decisions made in the next 12–18 months. I'll be shaping the interface that every customer sees — my comp should reflect the strategic weight of this work."
2. **Mist AI Usability Impact:** "The Mist AI 90% ticket reduction only works because the interface makes AI insights actionable. Design is a direct driver of this metric, and I'd like my compensation to reflect that contribution."
3. **Enterprise Networking UX Scarcity:** "Designers with deep enterprise networking domain experience are exceptionally rare. My portfolio demonstrates this specialization, and I'd like a scarcity premium reflected in my offer."
4. **Design System Integration:** "Unifying the design systems of two enterprise networking companies is a multi-quarter effort that requires senior design judgment. I'd like a retention component to ensure continuity through completion."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the opportunity to define the unified Juniper-HPE product experience. I have a competing offer at $185K total comp from [Cisco/ServiceNow/Datadog]. Given my enterprise networking UX portfolio and my ability to lead the design system integration, I'm targeting $195K–$205K total comp, structured as $142K base, $38K RSUs over four years, and a 10% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $182K total comp, but I'd need a $10K sign-on bonus at that level. I'd like to decide within the next week."
