### DevOps Engineer | Juniper Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI-Native Networking | HPE Unified Sales Comp | Mist AI Platform | Infrastructure Automation Tier

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Sunnyvale | $128K–$168K | $25K–$45K | 8–12% | $180K–$232K |
| Westford (MA) | $118K–$155K | $22K–$40K | 8–12% | $168K–$215K |
| Remote US | $115K–$150K | $20K–$38K | 8–12% | $168K–$208K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Juniper/HPE are the operational backbone of the AI-native networking platform, owning the CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and deployment automation that ensure Mist AI and Junos OS reach millions of enterprise devices reliably and securely. With the January 2026 HPE acquisition complete, DevOps engineers face the massive challenge of merging two separate build systems, deployment pipelines, cloud environments, and monitoring stacks into a unified operational platform — work that is invisible to customers but essential to every product launch. The Mist AI platform's 90% ticket reduction only works if the cloud infrastructure supporting it operates at five-nines availability, making DevOps engineers direct contributors to customer ROI.

**HPE Unified Sales Comp — The Synergy Accelerator Premium**

DevOps Engineers are essential "Synergy Accelerators" because the HPE-Juniper integration cannot ship a single unified product without merged build systems, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud infrastructure. The unified sales compensation structure launched in January 2026 means both companies' products now flow through a single go-to-market motion — and the DevOps engineers who make that possible by unifying the operational infrastructure are directly enabling revenue. The Mist AI platform's 90% ticket reduction depends on cloud infrastructure reliability: every dropped deployment, every misconfigured service, every missed monitoring alert directly degrades the AI models that deliver this metric. Negotiate by framing your work as the foundation that enables every other team's output. HPE historically offered DevOps/SRE roles stronger equity packages and on-call compensation, while Juniper provided higher base salaries for infrastructure roles. Push for the best of both. Additionally, emphasize the one-time nature of the infrastructure merge — you are being hired during the most operationally complex period in the combined company's history, and that temporal scarcity commands a premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **Infrastructure Merger Complexity:** "Merging two enterprise-scale CI/CD and cloud infrastructure stacks is a once-in-a-career operational challenge. I'd like my comp to reflect the scope and criticality of this integration work."
2. **Mist AI Uptime Dependency:** "The Mist AI platform's 90% ticket reduction depends on five-nines cloud availability. As the DevOps engineer ensuring that uptime, I'm a direct contributor to the customer ROI metric."
3. **On-Call and Operational Premium:** "I'd like to discuss on-call compensation separately from base salary. HPE's legacy on-call structure was more generous — I'd like the unified structure to adopt that standard."
4. **Dual-Pipeline Expertise:** "My experience with both Juniper-style and HPE-style deployment systems makes me uniquely qualified to lead the pipeline unification. This cross-domain expertise commands a scarcity premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm motivated by the challenge of unifying the Juniper-HPE operational infrastructure. I have a competing offer at $215K total comp from [Cloudflare/Datadog/HashiCorp]. Given my experience leading infrastructure mergers during acquisitions and my deep knowledge of networking platform deployment, I'm targeting $225K–$232K total comp, structured as $162K base, $42K RSUs over four years, and a 12% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $208K total comp, with an $8K sign-on bonus required at that level. I'd like to finalize by the end of this week."
