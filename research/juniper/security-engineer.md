**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Juniper/HPE protect the AI-native networking infrastructure that enterprises worldwide depend on for critical operations. With the January 2026 HPE acquisition finalized, security engineers face the critical challenge of securing the integration itself — merging identity systems, unifying security policies across Juniper and HPE infrastructure, conducting threat modeling on the combined attack surface, and ensuring that the Mist AI platform's cloud infrastructure meets the security standards of both companies' enterprise customer base. The Mist AI platform's 90% ticket reduction depends on customers trusting the platform with their network telemetry — and that trust is built and maintained by security engineers.

**HPE Unified Sales Comp — The Synergy Accelerator Premium**

Security Engineers are essential "Synergy Accelerators" because the HPE-Juniper integration creates a temporarily expanded attack surface that must be defended while two companies' security postures are merged into one. The unified sales compensation structure launched in January 2026 includes security-focused products (Juniper ATP, Connected Security, HPE Aruba security features) that are now sold as a unified portfolio — and the security engineers who build and validate these products directly enable revenue. The Mist AI 90% ticket reduction depends on the platform being trustworthy: enterprise customers will only send their network telemetry to a cloud platform if they believe it is secure. Every security vulnerability that is prevented, every compliance certification that is maintained, and every threat that is mitigated directly protects the revenue generated by Mist AI. Negotiate by quantifying the risk you mitigate: a single security breach during integration could destroy billions in combined company value and customer trust. HPE historically offered security engineers higher equity and bonus targets, reflecting the critical nature of the role. Juniper's base salaries for security roles were competitive with pure-play security companies. Push for the best of both, plus an integration-period premium for the additional attack surface you'll be defending.

**Global Levers**

1. **Integration Attack Surface Mitigation:** "The HPE-Juniper integration temporarily expands the attack surface across identity systems, cloud infrastructure, and API surfaces. I'm being hired to defend against this elevated risk — my comp should reflect the stakes."
2. **Mist AI Trust Foundation:** "Enterprise customers trust Mist AI with their network telemetry because of the security guarantees we provide. The 90% ticket reduction revenue depends on this trust, and I'm the engineer maintaining it."
3. **Security Clearance and Certification Premium:** "I hold [CISSP/OSCP/relevant clearance] certifications that are required for enterprise security roles. These credentials command a market premium that should be reflected in my offer."
4. **Compliance Continuity:** "Maintaining SOC 2, FedRAMP, and ISO 27001 compliance during an acquisition integration is exceptionally complex. My experience with compliance during M&A is a scarce skill."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm committed to securing the Juniper-HPE integration and the Mist AI platform. I have a competing offer at $242K total comp from [Palo Alto Networks/CrowdStrike/Cisco Security]. Given my experience with security during enterprise acquisitions and my expertise in cloud-native network security, I'm targeting $252K–$262K total comp, structured as $180K base, $52K RSUs over four years, and a 14% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $238K total comp, with a $12K sign-on bonus required at that level. I need to respond to my other offers by Thursday."
