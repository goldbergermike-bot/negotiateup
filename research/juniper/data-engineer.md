### Data Engineer | Juniper Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI-Native Networking | HPE Unified Sales Comp | Mist AI Platform | Data Pipeline Infrastructure Tier

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Sunnyvale | $130K–$170K | $25K–$48K | 8–12% | $185K–$238K |
| Westford (MA) | $120K–$158K | $22K–$42K | 8–12% | $172K–$220K |
| Remote US | $118K–$155K | $20K–$40K | 8–12% | $172K–$215K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Juniper/HPE build and maintain the data pipelines, streaming architectures, and data lake infrastructure that fuel the Mist AI platform and the combined company's analytics capabilities. With the January 2026 HPE acquisition finalized, data engineers face the formidable task of integrating two separate telemetry collection systems, data warehouses, and ETL pipelines into a unified data platform capable of processing network events from millions of devices across both installed bases. The Mist AI platform's 90% ticket reduction is only possible because the underlying data infrastructure delivers clean, real-time telemetry to the AI models — and data engineers are the ones who ensure that pipeline reliability.

**HPE Unified Sales Comp — The Synergy Accelerator Premium**

Data Engineers are foundational "Synergy Accelerators" because the HPE-Juniper integration's success depends on merging two massive network telemetry datasets into a unified data platform that serves both companies' AI and analytics products. The unified sales compensation structure launched in January 2026 means that sales teams need unified dashboards, unified customer analytics, and unified reporting — all of which depend on the data pipelines built by data engineers. The Mist AI 90% ticket reduction is powered by real-time data flowing through pipelines that data engineers build and maintain; without reliable data infrastructure, the AI models cannot make accurate predictions, and the metric collapses. Negotiate by framing yourself as the infrastructure layer that enables every AI and analytics initiative in the combined company. HPE historically offered data engineering roles stronger equity and bonus packages, while Juniper's base salaries for data engineers were competitive with cloud-native data companies. Push for the best of both: Juniper's base and HPE's equity and bonus structure. Additionally, emphasize the one-time data migration challenge — integrating two telemetry platforms is a project measured in quarters, not weeks, and justifies a retention grant.

**Global Levers**

1. **Telemetry Platform Unification:** "Merging two enterprise-scale network telemetry platforms into a unified data lake is a 12–18 month initiative. I'd like my comp to reflect the strategic importance and complexity of this foundational work."
2. **Mist AI Pipeline Dependency:** "Every AI model in Mist AI depends on the data pipeline I'll be building and maintaining. The 90% ticket reduction metric is only as reliable as the data infrastructure — I'm the engineer ensuring that reliability."
3. **Data Platform Scarcity:** "Data Engineers with experience building real-time streaming pipelines at scale for network telemetry are rare. My background in both batch and streaming architectures for IoT/networking data commands a premium."
4. **Migration Retention Grant:** "The data platform migration is a multi-quarter project that requires continuity. I'd like a retention RSU grant of $15K–$25K vesting over 18 months to ensure I see the migration through completion."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building the unified data platform for Juniper-HPE. I'm currently evaluating offers at $215K and $225K total comp from [Databricks/Snowflake/Confluent]. Given my experience building real-time telemetry pipelines for networking platforms and my ability to lead the data migration, I'm targeting $230K–$238K total comp, structured as $165K base, $45K RSUs over four years, and a 12% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $215K total comp, with a $12K sign-on bonus required at that level. I'd like to make a decision within the next week."
