**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Juniper/HPE are the analytical engine behind the AI-native networking platform, transforming terabytes of network telemetry into the predictive models and anomaly detection algorithms that power Mist AI. With the January 2026 HPE acquisition finalized, data scientists have access to an unprecedented dataset — the combined network telemetry from Juniper's and HPE Aruba's installed bases, covering millions of enterprise access points, switches, and routers. The Mist AI platform's 90% ticket reduction is a direct output of data science work — the models that predict failures, classify anomalies, and recommend remediations are built by this team.

**HPE Unified Sales Comp — The Synergy Accelerator Premium**

Data Scientists at Juniper/HPE are "Synergy Accelerators" in the most literal sense: the combined company's AI story depends on data scientists who can merge the telemetry datasets from both companies' installed bases and build models that work across the unified platform. The unified sales compensation structure launched in January 2026 means that sales teams are now selling AI-native networking capabilities as a core differentiator — and every sale depends on the models built by data scientists. The Mist AI 90% ticket reduction is the single most powerful proof point that data science at Juniper delivers measurable customer ROI, justifying premium compensation for the scientists who build these models. Negotiate by positioning your skills as the foundation of HPE's AI networking revenue story. HPE historically offered data scientists stronger equity packages and bonus targets, while Juniper's base salaries were highly competitive. Push for Juniper's higher base and HPE's more generous RSU grants and bonus targets. The combined telemetry dataset is a unique asset — emphasize that your ability to work across both datasets makes you more valuable than a data scientist at either company alone.

**Global Levers**

1. **Combined Telemetry Dataset:** "The merged Juniper-HPE telemetry dataset is the largest and most diverse network dataset in enterprise networking. My ability to build models across this unified data makes me uniquely valuable."
2. **Mist AI Model Ownership:** "The models that power the 90% ticket reduction are the core of Juniper's competitive moat. I'd like compensation that reflects the direct revenue impact of the data science behind Mist AI."
3. **AI Talent Market Premium:** "Data Scientists with networking domain expertise and production ML experience are being recruited aggressively by every major networking vendor. My comp should reflect current market rates for this intersection."
4. **Cross-Platform Model Integration:** "Building models that generalize across both Juniper and HPE Aruba hardware is a unique technical challenge. I'd like a sign-on bonus that reflects the ramp-up investment in learning both platforms."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the opportunity to build AI models on the combined Juniper-HPE telemetry dataset. I'm evaluating offers at $228K and $240K total comp from [Cisco AI/Google Cloud/Datadog]. Given my experience building production ML models for network anomaly detection, I'm targeting $240K–$248K total comp, structured as $170K base, $52K RSUs over four years, and a 14% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $225K total comp, with a $15K sign-on bonus required at that level. I need to respond to my other offers by end of week."
