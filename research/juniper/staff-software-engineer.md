### Staff Software Engineer | Juniper Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI-Native Networking | HPE Unified Sales Comp | Mist AI Platform | +15% Staff-Level Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Sunnyvale | $195K–$250K | $75K–$130K | 12–18% | $310K–$408K |
| Westford (MA) | $182K–$235K | $68K–$118K | 12–18% | $292K–$385K |
| Remote US | $178K–$228K | $65K–$112K | 12–18% | $292K–$372K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Juniper/HPE are the architects of the AI-native networking future, setting technical direction across multiple teams and owning system-level decisions that determine whether the HPE-Juniper integration succeeds or stumbles. At this level, engineers are expected to define the technical strategy for converging Junos OS, Mist AI, and HPE Aruba into a unified networking platform — work that directly impacts billions in combined revenue. The Mist AI platform's 90% ticket reduction validates that Juniper's architectural decisions at the staff level translate directly into customer value, making Staff SWEs among the most critical hires in the post-acquisition landscape.

**HPE Unified Sales Comp — The Synergy Accelerator Premium**

For Staff Software Engineers, the January 2026 unified HPE-Juniper compensation structure represents the single most powerful negotiation lever available. At this level, you are not merely an individual contributor — you are a "Synergy Accelerator" who defines the architectural blueprint for the combined company's networking stack. HPE's acquisition of Juniper was predicated on the value of AI-native networking, and the Mist AI platform's 90% ticket reduction is the quantified proof that this bet is paying off. Staff-level engineers who can drive this integration own disproportionate leverage. Historically, HPE's staff-level equity grants were 15–25% more generous than Juniper's, while Juniper offered higher base salaries at this tier. The unified comp structure is still being calibrated — this ambiguity is your leverage. Demand the higher base from Juniper's legacy band ($230K–$250K), the more generous RSU package from HPE's legacy band ($110K–$130K/4yr), and a bonus target that reflects staff-level scope (15–18%). Additionally, push for a one-time integration retention grant of $50K–$80K in RSUs, vesting over 18–24 months, as HPE has strong incentive to retain staff-level talent through the critical integration period.

**Global Levers**

1. **Architectural Authority Premium:** "At the Staff level, I'll be making architectural decisions that determine the success of the HPE-Juniper platform convergence. These decisions have multi-year, multi-billion-dollar revenue implications — I'd like compensation that reflects that scope."
2. **Mist AI Platform Ownership:** "The Mist AI platform's 90% ticket reduction represents a generational shift in enterprise networking. As a Staff SWE, I'll be extending this platform's capabilities across the combined HPE-Juniper portfolio — that's a unique value proposition."
3. **Integration Retention Grant:** "Post-acquisition attrition at the Staff IC level is the most damaging to product velocity. I'd like to discuss a retention RSU grant of $50K–$80K vesting over 18–24 months to ensure alignment through the integration."
4. **Dual-Company Band Maximization:** "I'd like my offer structured using the higher of HPE's and Juniper's legacy comp bands for each component: base, RSUs, and bonus target. The unified structure should benefit candidates, not constrain them."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the opportunity to shape the HPE-Juniper networking platform at the Staff level. I'm currently holding offers at $370K and $395K total comp from [Google Cloud Networking/Arista/Cisco Principal]. Given my track record of leading platform-level architecture across distributed networking systems, I'm targeting $395K–$408K total comp, structured as $245K base, $125K RSUs over four years, a 17% bonus target, and a $60K retention grant over 18 months. My accept-at floor is $370K total comp, but I would need the retention grant included at any level. I need to make a decision by Friday."
