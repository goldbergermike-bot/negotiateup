### Solutions Architect | Confluent Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced (Base + Equity + Bonus) | Apache Kafka Originators | Flink-First 2026 Strategy

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View | $168K–$210K | $155K–$258K | 10–15% | $208K–$278K |
| London | £72K–£92K | £62K–£105K | 10–15% | £85K–£118K |
| Bangalore | ₹42L–₹62L | ₹30L–₹50L | 10–15% | ₹50L–₹78L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Confluent SAs are the technical voice converting enterprise prospects from self-managed Kafka to Confluent Cloud — and now, adding Flink as a new upsell motion. The SA challenge is uniquely technical: Kafka architecture (partitioning strategy, replication, consumer group design) and Flink job design (state management, windowing, exactly-once semantics) require deep distributed systems expertise. In 2026, the Flink-first strategy gives SAs a new revenue lever: every Kafka customer is a potential Flink customer. SAs who can architect streaming + processing solutions (Kafka + Flink together) drive 2x the deal size of Kafka-only SAs. Balanced comp with three levers. [Source: Confluent SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Confluent Senior SA = Google Customer Engineer = Databricks Senior SA = MongoDB Senior SA

**Global Levers**

1. **Kafka + Flink Dual Revenue Motion:** "I can sell both Kafka (streaming) and Flink (processing) in every engagement — that's 2x the deal size of a Kafka-only SA. The Kafka + Flink combined architecture is Confluent's differentiated offering."
2. **Self-Managed to Cloud Migration:** "Every self-managed Kafka deployment I migrate to Confluent Cloud converts CapEx to subscription revenue. Migration SAs directly drive the most valuable revenue conversion at Confluent."
3. **Deep Distributed Systems Expertise:** "Kafka architecture + Flink job design requires rare distributed systems expertise. Partitioning strategy, state management, exactly-once semantics — I bring the technical depth that enterprise customers need."
4. **Three Levers:** Push for 20% more RSUs AND 15% bonus. Frame the dual revenue motion: "I drive both Kafka and Flink revenue in every engagement. That dual selling motion justifies above-band SA comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an SA role architecting Kafka + Flink solutions — driving 2x deal sizes through the dual streaming + processing motion — I'm targeting $245K in RSUs over 4 years with a 15% bonus. I also drive self-managed-to-cloud migration revenue. I have competing SA offers from [Databricks/Snowflake] with stronger equity." Confluent will counter at $215K-$240K RSUs — accept at $225K+ with 12-15% bonus.
