**Negotiation DNA**

Confluent TPMs coordinate execution across the Kafka + Flink product portfolio — managing the dependencies between broker development, Flink runtime, Confluent Cloud infrastructure, ksqlDB, Connect ecosystem, and the open-source community release cadence. The 2026 Flink-first strategy creates the most complex TPM challenge: coordinating Flink product development alongside ongoing Kafka evolution, while managing the open-source vs. commercial feature split for both projects. TPMs at open-source companies have a unique challenge that most enterprise TPMs don't face: balancing Apache Foundation release cycles with commercial product timelines. Balanced comp with three levers. [Source: Confluent TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Confluent Senior TPM = Google L4 TPM = Databricks Senior TPM = MongoDB Senior TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Kafka + Flink Dual-Track Coordination:** "I manage two major product tracks simultaneously — Kafka evolution and Flink acceleration — with shared engineering resources and cross-product dependencies. This dual-track coordination complexity is unique to Confluent."
2. **Open-Source + Commercial Release Management:** "I coordinate Apache Foundation release cycles alongside Confluent Cloud commercial releases. Balancing open-source community timelines with commercial product deadlines is a TPM challenge that doesn't exist at non-open-source companies."
3. **Flink Strategy Acceleration:** "The Flink-first strategy has tight timelines. I'm the TPM ensuring Flink features ship on schedule — directly accelerating Confluent's primary growth investment."
4. **Three Levers:** Push for 20% more equity AND 15% bonus. Frame: "I coordinate the programs that determine whether the Flink-first strategy succeeds on schedule. That execution dependency justifies above-band comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a TPM role coordinating Kafka + Flink dual-track development with open-source community release management — the programs that determine whether Confluent's Flink-first strategy delivers on time — I'm targeting $235K in RSUs over 4 years with a 15% bonus. I have competing TPM offers from [ServiceNow/Datadog] with stronger equity." Confluent will counter at $208K-$232K RSUs — accept at $218K+ with 12-15% bonus.
