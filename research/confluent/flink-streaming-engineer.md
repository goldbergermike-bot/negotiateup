### Flink Streaming Engineer | Confluent Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced (Base + Equity + Bonus) | Apache Kafka Originators | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15–25% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View | $192K–$238K | $230K–$380K | 10–15% | $270K–$358K |
| London | £82K–£108K | £92K–£155K | 10–15% | £110K–£158K |
| Bangalore | ₹52L–₹80L | ₹45L–₹72L | 10–15% | ₹68L–₹108L |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Confluent's signature role for 2026 — the Flink Streaming Engineer. You're building the core of Confluent's primary strategic investment: making Apache Flink the unified stream processing standard. This means building managed Flink on Confluent Cloud — autoscaling, state management, checkpoint optimization, exactly-once processing guarantees, and the Flink SQL layer that makes stream processing accessible to every developer. This role represents Confluent's evolution from a Kafka company to a Kafka + Flink platform company. The processing layer is where Confluent captures the highest-value compute revenue — streaming data is a pipeline, but processing streaming data is where the compute dollars are.

**Level Mapping:** Confluent Flink Streaming Eng (Senior) = Databricks Spark Runtime Eng = Google L4-L5 Stream Processing = Amazon Kinesis Senior Eng

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Flink Streaming Engineer works at the core of Confluent's 2026 strategic pivot:
- **Managed Flink Runtime:** The hosted Flink service on Confluent Cloud — autoscaling, resource management, and multi-tenant isolation for stateful stream processing
- **Flink SQL Engine:** The SQL layer that makes stream processing accessible to data engineers and analysts — not just Java/Scala developers
- **State Management at Scale:** The state backend infrastructure that enables exactly-once processing with fault tolerance across distributed Flink clusters
- **Kafka-Flink Native Integration:** The zero-copy, native integration between Kafka topics and Flink processing — no data movement, no serialization overhead, unified security model
- **Real-Time AI Processing:** The Flink runtime extensions for ML model inference on streaming data — enabling real-time AI applications on Confluent Cloud

**Global Levers**

1. **Flink-First = Confluent's Future:** "Flink is Confluent's primary strategic investment for 2026. I'm building the core product that defines Confluent's evolution from a Kafka company to a Kafka + Flink platform company. My engineering directly determines whether the Flink-first strategy succeeds."
2. **Processing Revenue > Pipeline Revenue:** "Streaming data through Kafka is pipeline revenue. Processing streaming data through Flink is compute revenue — higher margin, higher value. I'm building the product that captures the highest-value revenue at Confluent."
3. **Apache Flink Community Leadership:** "My contributions to Flink go upstream to the Apache Foundation. I'm not just building a product — I'm shaping the open-source stream processing standard used by thousands of companies worldwide."
4. **Kafka-Flink Native Integration — Competitive Moat:** "No other company can offer native Kafka + Flink integration with zero data movement. My work on the Kafka-Flink integration layer IS Confluent's competitive moat against AWS Kinesis, GCP Dataflow, and Azure Stream Analytics."
5. **Agentic AI Premium (15-25%):** If building the real-time AI processing layer or autonomous stream optimization agents, push for the full agentic premium: "I'm enabling real-time AI on Confluent — ML model inference on streaming data that allows autonomous agents to process and act on events in real-time."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $360K in RSUs over 4 years with a 15% bonus for this Flink Streaming Engineer role. I'm building the core of Confluent's primary strategic investment — the managed Flink service that transforms Confluent from a Kafka company into the unified real-time data platform. My work on Kafka-Flink native integration creates the competitive moat that cloud providers can't replicate. I have a Databricks offer with pre-IPO equity at $420K and an Amazon Kinesis team offer. Confluent's Flink vision is the most compelling stream processing opportunity, but the equity needs to reflect that I'm building the company's future." Confluent will counter at $315K-$355K RSUs — accept at $335K+ with 15% bonus confirmed. This is the role that determines whether Confluent successfully pivots from a Kafka company to a platform company.
