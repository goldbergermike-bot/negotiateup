**Negotiation DNA**

Confluent Data Scientists work with a unique dataset: the metadata from millions of Kafka and Flink deployments — throughput patterns, consumer lag signals, partition rebalancing events, and Flink job performance metrics. This operational data enables ML-powered features: auto-scaling, intelligent partitioning, anomaly detection, and cost optimization for Confluent Cloud. In 2026, the Flink-first strategy creates new DS opportunities: building ML models that optimize Flink job scheduling, state management, and checkpoint tuning. Confluent's consumption-based pricing means every DS optimization that improves efficiency or reduces cost-per-event directly impacts customer retention and expansion. Balanced comp with three levers. [Source: Confluent DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Confluent Senior DS = Google L4 DS = Databricks Senior DS = MongoDB Senior DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Streaming Operations Data Moat:** "Confluent has operational data from millions of Kafka + Flink deployments — throughput patterns, consumer lag, partition behavior, job performance. This streaming-specific dataset enables ML models that no competitor can build."
2. **Flink ML Optimization:** "Flink job optimization is a new ML frontier: auto-scaling, state management, checkpoint tuning, and job scheduling. My ML models directly improve the managed Flink experience that drives Confluent's 2026 growth."
3. **Consumption Optimization = Retention:** "Confluent's consumption-based pricing means cost optimization is customer retention. My ML models that reduce cost-per-event directly protect and grow subscription revenue."
4. **Three Levers:** Push for 25% more equity AND 15% bonus. Frame: "ML models that optimize Flink performance directly drive the managed Flink product experience. That product impact justifies above-band comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a DS role building ML models on Confluent's streaming operations dataset — optimizing Flink job performance and Kafka cluster efficiency — I'm targeting $265K in RSUs over 4 years with a 15% bonus. My models directly improve the managed Flink experience that drives 2026 growth. I have competing DS offers from [Databricks/MongoDB] with stronger equity." Confluent will counter at $235K-$260K RSUs — accept at $245K+ with 15% bonus.
