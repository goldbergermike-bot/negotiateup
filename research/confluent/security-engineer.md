### Security Engineer | Confluent Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced (Base + Equity + Bonus) | Apache Kafka Originators | Flink-First 2026 Strategy

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View | $180K–$222K | $190K–$310K | 10–15% | $235K–$305K |
| London | £78K–£100K | £78K–£128K | 10–15% | £98K–£138K |
| Bangalore | ₹48L–₹72L | ₹38L–₹62L | 10–15% | ₹58L–₹92L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Confluent Security Engineers protect the real-time data infrastructure that enterprises trust with their most sensitive event streams — financial transactions, healthcare events, PII data flows, and compliance-critical audit trails. Kafka is the "central nervous system" for enterprise data — if it's compromised, every downstream system is affected. The security surface is uniquely challenging: securing multi-tenant Kafka clusters, Flink job isolation, schema-level access control, and end-to-end encryption for data-in-motion (not just data-at-rest). Confluent's enterprise customers (banks, healthcare, government) require security certifications (SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP) that are table stakes for revenue. Balanced comp with three levers.

**Level Mapping:** Confluent Senior Security Eng = Google L4 Security = Databricks Senior Security Eng = MongoDB Senior Security Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Central Nervous System Security:** "Kafka is the central nervous system for enterprise data — every critical event flows through it. Compromising Kafka means compromising every downstream system. My security work protects the most critical data infrastructure layer."
2. **Data-in-Motion Security:** "Most security focuses on data-at-rest. I secure data-in-motion — real-time event streams flowing between systems. End-to-end encryption, schema-level access control, and multi-tenant isolation for streaming data is a specialized security domain."
3. **Flink Job Isolation:** "The Flink-first strategy creates new security challenges: job isolation in multi-tenant processing, state access control, and checkpoint security. I'm securing a new processing layer alongside the existing streaming layer."
4. **Security Certifications = Revenue:** "SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP — every certification I maintain unlocks an enterprise segment. My security work directly enables revenue from regulated industries."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a security role protecting Confluent's real-time data infrastructure — the central nervous system for enterprise data with data-in-motion security challenges unique to streaming — I'm targeting $295K in RSUs over 4 years with a 15% bonus. Streaming security expertise is rare. I have competing security offers from [CrowdStrike/Snowflake] with stronger equity." Confluent will counter at $260K-$290K RSUs — accept at $270K+ with 15% bonus.
