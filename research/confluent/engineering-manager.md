**Negotiation DNA**

Confluent EMs lead teams building the foundational real-time data platform — Kafka brokers, Flink processors, Confluent Cloud managed services, ksqlDB, and the Connect ecosystem. The 2026 challenge: scaling the Flink engineering team rapidly while maintaining the quality bar that Kafka's enterprise customers demand. Confluent's co-founders (Jay Kreps, Neha Narkhede, Jun Rao) created Kafka at LinkedIn — they're deeply technical and expect EMs to make architectural decisions alongside people management. The Flink-first strategy means EMs who can recruit Flink specialists (a scarce talent pool) and integrate them with existing Kafka teams are in high demand. Balanced comp model with 15-20% bonus at EM level. [Source: Confluent EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Confluent EM = Google L5 Manager = Meta M1 = Databricks EM = MongoDB EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Flink Team Building:** "Confluent needs to rapidly scale the Flink engineering team while the talent pool of experienced Flink engineers is extremely small. I can recruit, onboard, and retain Flink specialists — that team-building capability directly accelerates Confluent's primary growth strategy."
2. **Technical EM Culture:** "Confluent's co-founders created Kafka — they expect EMs to be deeply technical. I bring both management skill and the distributed systems expertise to review Kafka/Flink architecture decisions alongside my team."
3. **Open-Source Community Management:** "My team contributes to Apache Kafka and Flink. I manage the balance between open-source community contribution and Confluent Cloud commercial differentiation — that's a management challenge unique to open-source companies."
4. **Push All Three Levers:** Push equity 25% higher AND push bonus to 20%. Frame: "I'm building the team that executes the Flink-first strategy. Team quality determines product quality determines revenue growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an EM role building the Flink engineering team — Confluent's primary growth investment for 2026 — I'm targeting $410K in RSUs over 4 years with a 20% bonus. Flink talent is scarce, and I can recruit and retain the specialists Confluent needs. I have competing EM offers from [Databricks/MongoDB] with stronger equity packages." Confluent will counter at $360K-$400K RSUs — accept at $375K+ with 18-20% bonus.
