### DevOps / Platform Engineer | Confluent Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced (Base + Equity + Bonus) | Apache Kafka Originators | Flink-First 2026 Strategy

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View | $170K–$210K | $170K–$280K | 10–15% | $215K–$285K |
| London | £72K–£92K | £68K–£115K | 10–15% | £88K–£120K |
| Bangalore | ₹42L–₹65L | ₹32L–₹55L | 10–15% | ₹52L–₹85L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Confluent Platform Engineers build the infrastructure that runs Confluent Cloud — the multi-cloud Kubernetes orchestration, Kafka cluster provisioning, Flink job scheduling, and the autoscaling systems that manage billions of events per day. This is "streaming infrastructure for streaming infrastructure" — you're building the platform that runs the platform that everyone else uses for real-time data. The Flink-first strategy adds new infrastructure challenges: Flink state management at scale, checkpoint storage, and GPU-aware scheduling for ML-powered stream processing. Multi-cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) deployment is a core requirement. Balanced comp with three levers. [Source: Confluent Platform Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Confluent Senior Platform Eng = Google L4 SRE = Databricks Senior Platform Eng = MongoDB Senior Platform Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Streaming Infrastructure for Streaming Infrastructure:** "I'm building the platform that runs Confluent Cloud — the infrastructure that runs the streaming infrastructure that enterprises depend on. Every reliability decision I make affects billions of events per day."
2. **Flink Infrastructure — New Challenge:** "The Flink-first strategy requires new infrastructure: stateful job management, checkpoint storage, autoscaling for processing workloads, and GPU scheduling for ML stream processing. I'm building the infra for Confluent's primary growth product."
3. **Multi-Cloud Scale:** "Confluent Cloud runs on AWS, GCP, and Azure. I build the multi-cloud Kubernetes orchestration that ensures consistent performance and reliability across all three cloud providers."
4. **Three Levers — Push All:** Push for 25% more equity AND 15% bonus. Frame: "Platform reliability is the product. If Confluent Cloud goes down, customers lose real-time data. My infrastructure work IS the product quality."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a platform engineering role building Confluent Cloud infrastructure — multi-cloud Kafka + Flink cluster management processing billions of events per day — I'm targeting $265K in RSUs over 4 years with a 15% bonus. I'm building the reliability layer for real-time data infrastructure that enterprises depend on. I have competing platform offers from [Databricks/MongoDB] with stronger equity." Confluent will counter at $235K-$260K RSUs — accept at $245K+ with 15% bonus.
