**Negotiation DNA**

Confluent ML/AI Engineers build intelligent streaming systems — ML models that run ON real-time data streams. This is a unique ML engineering discipline: your models don't run on batch data, they run on continuous, unbounded data streams through Flink. Anomaly detection on streaming data, real-time predictive models, intelligent auto-scaling, and AI-powered stream processing optimization are all ML challenges that are fundamentally different from batch ML. The Flink-first strategy makes this role critical: building ML capabilities native to Flink enables Confluent to position as the real-time AI processing platform, not just a data pipeline. The Agentic AI Premium (15-25%) applies because you're building autonomous streaming agents that detect, respond to, and optimize data flows without human intervention.

**Level Mapping:** Confluent Senior ML Eng = Google L4 ML = Databricks Senior ML = MongoDB Senior ML

**Global Levers**

1. **Real-Time ML — Fundamentally Different Discipline:** "ML on streaming data is fundamentally different from batch ML. Unbounded data, concept drift, real-time feature computation, and continuous model updating — I bring specialized streaming ML expertise that batch ML engineers don't have."
2. **Flink ML Processing Platform:** "Building ML capabilities native to Flink transforms Confluent from a data pipeline into a real-time AI processing platform. My ML engineering work creates an entirely new product category."
3. **Agentic AI Premium (15-25%):** "I'm building autonomous streaming agents — ML systems that detect anomalies, optimize throughput, predict failures, and auto-remediate issues on live data streams without human intervention. This is agentic AI applied to real-time data infrastructure."
4. **Streaming ML Scarcity:** Streaming ML engineers are the rarest talent segment in data infrastructure. Push for 30% more RSUs: "ML engineers who understand streaming (not batch) are extremely rare. That scarcity justifies above-band equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an ML/AI role building real-time ML capabilities native to Flink — creating the streaming AI processing platform that is Confluent's next product category — I'm targeting $345K in RSUs over 4 years with a 15% bonus and the 15-25% Agentic AI Premium. I have a Databricks ML offer with pre-IPO equity at $400K and a MongoDB Voyage AI offer at $350K. Confluent's real-time ML positioning is unique, but the equity needs to reflect streaming ML scarcity." Confluent will counter at $300K-$340K RSUs — accept at $320K+ with 15% bonus.
