**Negotiation DNA**

Design at Confluent is the art of making distributed streaming infrastructure accessible to developers who aren't distributed systems experts. You're designing the Confluent Cloud console: Flink SQL editors, Kafka topic management, stream lineage visualization, schema evolution UIs, and connector configuration workflows. The 2026 Flink-first strategy creates new design surfaces: Flink job monitoring, stateful processing visualization, and Flink SQL query building. The design challenge is unique — making real-time data pipelines visible and manageable through intuitive UIs. Balanced comp with three levers. Small design team means outsized per-designer impact.

**Level Mapping:** Confluent Senior Designer = Google L4 UX = Databricks Senior Designer = MongoDB Senior Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Making Streaming Accessible:** "I'm designing UIs that make Kafka and Flink accessible to developers who aren't distributed systems experts. Translating real-time data pipeline complexity into intuitive interfaces directly drives Confluent Cloud adoption."
2. **Flink UX — New Design Surface:** "The Flink-first strategy creates entirely new design surfaces: Flink SQL editors, job monitoring dashboards, stateful processing visualization. I'm defining the UX for a product category that's being built in real-time."
3. **Stream Lineage Visualization:** "Visualizing data flowing through streaming pipelines in real-time is one of the hardest visualization challenges in data infrastructure. Stream lineage, data quality monitoring, and pipeline health — all visual design problems."
4. **Small Team, Big Impact:** Push for 20% more RSUs. Frame: "Confluent's design team is small — each designer covers a large product surface area. My per-designer impact is 3-5x higher than at larger companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a design role creating the UX for Confluent's Flink product — new design surfaces that define the managed stream processing experience — I'm targeting $170K in RSUs over 4 years with a 15% bonus. The design team is small, so my impact per designer is outsized. I have competing design offers with stronger initial equity." Confluent will counter at $148K-$165K RSUs — accept at $155K+ with 12-15% bonus.
