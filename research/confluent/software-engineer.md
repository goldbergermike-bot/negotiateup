**Negotiation DNA**

Confluent is the company that created Apache Kafka — the de facto standard for real-time data streaming used by 80%+ of the Fortune 500. In 2026, the strategic pivot is to Apache Flink: Confluent is positioning Flink as the unified stream processing standard, with Confluent Cloud's managed Flink service becoming the primary growth driver alongside Kafka. You're not just building a streaming platform — you're building the real-time data infrastructure that every AI agent, every event-driven architecture, and every real-time application depends on. The balanced comp model (base + equity + 10-15% bonus) gives you three negotiation levers. Confluent's stock has been volatile, so push for larger RSU grants to account for price risk.

**Level Mapping:** Confluent SWE = Google L3 = Meta E3 = Databricks SWE = Elastic SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Kafka Originators — Industry Standard:** "Confluent created Kafka — the streaming platform that 80%+ of the Fortune 500 depends on. I'm building the product that defined real-time data infrastructure as a category."
2. **Flink-First 2026 Strategy:** "Confluent's 2026 strategy is Flink-first — making Apache Flink the unified stream processing standard. I'll be building managed Flink capabilities that represent Confluent's primary growth vector."
3. **AI-Era Real-Time Infrastructure:** "Every AI agent needs real-time data. Every RAG pipeline needs fresh data. Every event-driven AI application runs on streaming infrastructure. Confluent is the real-time data layer for the AI economy."
4. **Three Levers — Push All Three:** Unlike equity-only companies, Confluent has base + equity + bonus. Push for 20% more RSUs AND push the bonus from 10% to 15%. Most candidates negotiate only equity — the bonus is the overlooked lever.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I appreciate the initial offer. Based on competing offers from [Databricks/MongoDB] and my interest in the Flink-first strategy, I'd like to see the RSU grant increased to $180K over 4 years with the bonus confirmed at 15%. Confluent's real-time data platform is the foundation for AI applications — the comp should reflect that strategic importance." Confluent will counter at $155K-$175K RSUs — accept at $165K+ with 12-15% bonus.
