**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Tempus design the interfaces that oncologists use to make precision medicine treatment decisions — Tempus One (the physician-facing clinical decision support platform), diagnostic report layouts, clinical trial matching interfaces, and data visualization tools. The role has direct clinical impact: designing how AI-generated treatment recommendations are presented to oncologists, ensuring information hierarchy supports rapid clinical decision-making. Healthcare UX at Tempus requires understanding oncology workflows, clinical information needs, and the cognitive load of physicians making treatment decisions. Tempus's startup culture means designers have significant influence on product direction. [Source: Tempus Design 2025]
