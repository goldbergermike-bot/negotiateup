**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Tempus lead technical design for the clinical data platform, physician-facing tools, and data infrastructure that power precision medicine AI. Senior engineers own the architecture of systems that process multimodal clinical data — genomic sequencing results, pathology images, clinical records, treatment outcomes — and make this data accessible to AI models and physician-facing applications. Tempus's senior engineering culture emphasizes ownership, technical quality, and clinical impact. Senior engineers make architectural decisions that affect data pipeline reliability, model serving latency, and the accuracy of clinical decision support tools. The role requires strong distributed systems skills combined with understanding of healthcare data (genomics, clinical records, imaging). [Source: Tempus Engineering Career Framework 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Tempus Senior SWE = Google L4 = Flatiron Senior = Foundation Medicine Senior

**Global Levers**

1. **Growth-Stage Senior Equity:** "At the senior level, equity upside is the most meaningful comp lever. Tempus is expanding into multiple disease areas — my equity grants could appreciate significantly. Push for $150K+ in equity."
2. **Clinical Platform Architecture:** "My architectural decisions affect the reliability and accuracy of Tempus's clinical decision support — used by oncologists treating cancer patients. This responsibility premium should be in the comp."
3. **National Market Benchmark:** "Senior engineers at Tempus should be benchmarked against national precision medicine and health tech companies, not Chicago-only rates."
4. **Precision Medicine Domain:** "I bring healthcare/precision medicine engineering experience that shortens the domain ramp by 6-12 months."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $210K with equity at $160K/4yr and a 12% bonus. My senior engineering experience in [clinical data platforms / healthcare infrastructure / precision medicine] makes me immediately effective at Tempus." Tempus will counter at $175K-$200K base with $90K-$135K equity. Accept if total comp exceeds $270K. Push on equity.
