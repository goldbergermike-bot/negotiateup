### Security Engineer | Tempus Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** AI-Driven Precision Medicine / Growth-Stage / Equity Upside / Genomic + Clinical Data Protection

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Tempus protect one of the most sensitive data assets in precision medicine — the world's largest clinical+molecular data library containing genomic sequencing data, pathology images, clinical records, and treatment outcomes for hundreds of thousands of cancer patients. This data is both HIPAA-protected (clinical records) and represents uniquely sensitive genomic information covered by GINA. Security engineers manage cloud security (AWS), application security, data access controls, HIPAA/SOC 2 compliance, and the security of AI model training pipelines (protecting against data poisoning and model extraction attacks). Tempus's pharma partnerships require strong security posture — pharmaceutical companies will not share proprietary data with a partner that has security vulnerabilities.

**Level Mapping:** Tempus Security = Google L4 Security = Flatiron Security = Foundation Medicine Security

**Global Levers**

1. **Genomic + Clinical Data Sensitivity:** "Tempus's data library contains genomic and clinical data for hundreds of thousands of cancer patients. This is among the most sensitive data in healthcare — the security mandate justifies premium comp."
2. **Growth-Stage Equity:** "Push for top equity. Strong security posture directly enables pharma partnerships — Tempus's highest-margin revenue."
3. **HIPAA + Genomic Security:** "I bring experience with HIPAA, GINA, and genomic data security — specialized compliance expertise."
4. **AI Security:** "Securing ML training pipelines against data poisoning and model extraction is a specialized skill."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with equity at $150K/4yr and a 12% bonus. My healthcare security experience protecting [genomic data / clinical platforms / AI systems] directly enables Tempus's pharma partnerships." Tempus will counter at $170K-$195K base with $80K-$130K equity. Accept if total comp exceeds $260K. Push on equity.
