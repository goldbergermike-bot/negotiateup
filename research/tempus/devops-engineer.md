**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Tempus manage the cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and platform engineering for a rapidly scaling precision medicine platform. Tempus runs on AWS with a cloud-native, Kubernetes-based architecture that must handle diverse workloads: genomic analysis pipelines (compute-intensive), ML model training and serving, real-time clinical decision support (low-latency), and high-volume data ingestion from healthcare partners. The infrastructure must satisfy HIPAA compliance, SOC 2, and clinical data integrity requirements while maintaining the deployment velocity of a growth-stage company. DevOps engineers at Tempus build internal developer platforms that accelerate the entire engineering organization. [Source: Tempus Infrastructure 2025]
