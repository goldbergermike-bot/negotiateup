**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Tempus design the technical architecture for integrating Tempus's precision medicine platform with healthcare systems, pharmaceutical partners, and clinical trial networks. The role requires designing data integration architectures (clinical data ingestion from EHRs, lab systems, and pathology platforms), clinical workflow integrations (embedding Tempus One into existing clinical workflows), and pharma partnership data architectures (secure data sharing for drug development analytics). Solutions Architects must understand healthcare interoperability standards (HL7 FHIR, clinical data models), cloud architecture (AWS), API design, and the unique requirements of pharma data sharing agreements. The role is client-facing — SAs work directly with healthcare system IT teams and pharma data science organizations. [Source: Tempus Solutions Architecture 2025]
