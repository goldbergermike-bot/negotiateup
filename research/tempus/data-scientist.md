### Data Scientist | Tempus Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** AI-Driven Precision Medicine / Growth-Stage / Equity Upside / Oncology Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Chicago IL | $150K–$205K | $60K–$165K/4yr | 10–12% | $185K–$295K |
| Bay Area CA | $160K–$215K | $65K–$175K/4yr | 10–12% | $200K–$310K |
| Remote US | $140K–$200K | $55K–$155K/4yr | 10–12% | $175K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Tempus analyze the world's largest clinical+molecular dataset for precision medicine — building models and analytics that discover biomarkers, predict treatment outcomes, optimize clinical trial design, and generate real-world evidence for pharmaceutical partners. The role is uniquely high-impact: Tempus's data science directly influences which treatments oncologists recommend for cancer patients and which drug candidates pharmaceutical companies advance. Data scientists work with multimodal data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, clinical records, imaging, outcomes), requiring expertise in survival analysis, causal inference, high-dimensional statistics, and biological interpretation. Tempus's pharma partnerships mean data science work also generates direct revenue — analytical insights sold to pharmaceutical companies for drug development and market access.

**Level Mapping:** Tempus Data Scientist = Google L4 DS = Flatiron DS = Foundation Medicine DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue-Generating Analytics:** "My analytical insights are sold to pharmaceutical partners — this is revenue-generating data science, not cost-center analytics. Comp should reflect revenue attribution."
2. **Growth-Stage Equity:** "Push for top equity grants. Tempus's pharma partnerships are growing rapidly — my data science directly expands this revenue."
3. **Oncology Domain Expertise:** "I bring precision medicine data science experience — survival analysis, biomarker discovery, treatment outcome modeling — that general data scientists lack."
4. **Clinical Impact Frame:** "My analyses influence cancer treatment decisions. The clinical responsibility premium should be in comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $200K with equity at $145K/4yr and a 12% bonus. My precision medicine data science experience with [biomarker discovery / survival analysis / clinical analytics] directly generates pharma partnership revenue." Tempus will counter at $165K-$190K base with $80K-$120K equity. Accept if total comp exceeds $250K. Push on equity.
