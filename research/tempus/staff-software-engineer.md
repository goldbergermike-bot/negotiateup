**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Tempus set the technical direction for the company's precision medicine platform — the data infrastructure, ML serving systems, clinical applications, and developer experience that power everything Tempus does. At a growth-stage company ($6B+ valuation), Staff engineers have outsized influence: they shape the architecture that must scale as Tempus expands from oncology into cardiology, neurology, infectious disease, and beyond. Staff engineers at Tempus interact directly with the C-suite and scientific leadership, making technical decisions that affect the company's product strategy and competitive positioning. The equity component is particularly meaningful at the Staff level — a significant equity grant at a growth-stage company with expanding TAM has substantial upside potential.

**Level Mapping:** Tempus Staff SWE = Google L5-L6 = Flatiron Staff = Microsoft Principal

**Global Levers**

1. **Growth-Stage Staff Equity:** "Staff engineers at growth-stage companies should receive significant equity — my technical leadership directly drives company valuation. Push for $200K+ in equity."
2. **Platform-Wide Architecture:** "My architectural decisions scale across all of Tempus's disease areas — oncology, cardiology, neurology. As the platform expands, my architecture serves an increasingly large business."
3. **Big Tech Comp Parity:** "At the Staff level, Tempus competes with Google, Meta, and established biotech for talent. Comp should be competitive with Big Tech L5-L6."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "Staff bonus targets range 12-18%. Target 18% for platform-level architectural scope."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $245K with equity at $220K/4yr and an 18% bonus. I'm setting the technical direction for Tempus's entire precision medicine platform as the company expands into multiple disease areas. My staff-level architecture experience at [current company] makes me immediately impactful." Tempus will counter at $205K-$235K base with $130K-$190K equity. Accept if total comp exceeds $340K. Push hard on equity — growth-stage upside is the primary lever.
