**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Tempus build production machine learning systems for precision medicine — the core technology that differentiates Tempus from traditional healthcare analytics companies. Tempus's AI platform processes multimodal data (genomics, transcriptomics, clinical records, pathology images, treatment outcomes) using state-of-the-art ML techniques: transformers for clinical NLP, graph neural networks for molecular interaction modeling, multimodal learning for combining diverse data types, and deep learning for pathology image analysis. ML engineers build the infrastructure (feature stores, model registries, inference serving, monitoring) and the models themselves. Tempus's AI directly impacts clinical care — models deployed to oncologists influence treatment decisions — creating both extraordinary impact and significant responsibility. The AI/ML premium at Tempus is 15-25% above standard engineering bands. [Source: Tempus AI/ML Engineering 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Tempus ML Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML = Flatiron ML = Recursion ML

**Global Levers**

1. **Clinical AI Impact:** "My models influence cancer treatment decisions. This is clinical-grade AI with life-or-death stakes — not content recommendation. The responsibility premium should be reflected."
2. **Growth-Stage AI Equity:** "Push for top equity. Tempus's AI capabilities directly drive its valuation and pharma partnership revenue."
3. **Precision Medicine AI Scarcity:** "ML engineers who understand both production ML and oncology/genomics are extremely rare."
4. **Big Tech AI Competition:** "Tempus competes with Google DeepMind, Recursion, and Foundation Medicine for AI talent. Comp should compete."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $210K with equity at $170K/4yr and a 15% bonus. My precision medicine ML experience with [clinical prediction / multimodal learning / genomics AI] directly powers Tempus's core value proposition." Tempus will counter at $175K-$200K base with $95K-$140K equity. Accept if total comp exceeds $275K. Push on equity.
