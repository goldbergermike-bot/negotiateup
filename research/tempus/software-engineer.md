### Software Engineer | Tempus Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** AI-Driven Precision Medicine / Growth-Stage / Equity Upside / Chicago HQ

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Chicago IL | $140K–$195K | $50K–$150K/4yr | 10% | $170K–$270K |
| Bay Area CA | $150K–$205K | $55K–$160K/4yr | 10% | $185K–$285K |
| Remote US | $135K–$190K | $45K–$140K/4yr | 10% | $160K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Tempus build the technology platform that powers AI-driven precision medicine for cancer and other diseases. The engineering scope spans the clinical data platform (ingesting and structuring clinical records, genomic data, pathology images), the physician-facing portal (Tempus One — real-time clinical decision support), the clinical trial matching engine, diagnostic report generation, and internal data management tools. Tempus has a modern tech stack (Python, Go, React, AWS, Kubernetes) and a startup-meets-biotech engineering culture that values speed, technical quality, and clinical impact. As a recently public company ($6B+ valuation), Tempus offers equity (TEM stock) that has growth-stage upside — the company is expanding from oncology into cardiology, neurology, and infectious disease. Chicago headquarters provides lower cost of living than Bay Area/NYC with competitive comp. [Source: Tempus Technology Careers 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Tempus SWE = Google L3-L4 = Flatiron Health SWE = Foundation Medicine SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Growth-Stage Equity Upside:** "Tempus is a recently public company with significant growth runway — expanding from oncology into multiple disease areas. My equity grants have meaningful upside as the company scales. Push for top-of-band equity."
2. **Chicago Cost Advantage:** "Chicago offers strong purchasing power with lower cost of living than Bay Area or NYC. But my comp should reflect national market rates for precision medicine engineering talent, not Chicago-only benchmarks."
3. **Clinical Impact Culture:** "My engineering work directly impacts cancer patient care. This mission-driven context attracts top talent — Tempus should match the comp to retain them."
4. **Modern Tech Stack:** "Tempus runs a modern, cloud-native stack. My experience with [Python/Go/React/AWS/Kubernetes] means I'm productive from day one."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $190K with equity at $130K/4yr and a 10% bonus. My experience building [clinical data platforms / healthcare applications / ML-serving infrastructure] at [current company] maps directly to Tempus's technology needs." Tempus will counter at $155K-$180K base with $65K-$110K equity. Accept if total comp exceeds $220K. Push on equity for growth upside.
