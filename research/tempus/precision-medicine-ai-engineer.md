**Negotiation DNA**

Tempus ($6B+ valuation, publicly traded as TEM since 2024) is the leading AI-driven precision medicine company, building the world's largest library of clinical and molecular data and an operating system to make that data accessible and actionable for physicians. The Precision Medicine AI Engineer is Tempus's signature technical role — building ML models that match cancer patients with optimal therapies, predict treatment outcomes, identify biomarkers, and accelerate clinical trial enrollment. Tempus has assembled one of the most comprehensive oncology datasets in the world: genomic sequencing data, clinical records, imaging, pathology, and treatment outcomes for hundreds of thousands of cancer patients. The company's AI platform analyzes this multimodal data to provide real-time clinical decision support to oncologists. This role combines deep ML engineering (transformers, graph neural networks, multimodal learning) with precision medicine domain expertise (oncology, genomics, clinical trial design). Tempus competes with Foundation Medicine (Roche), Flatiron Health (Roche), and Guardant Health for AI talent, and also with Big Tech AI labs.

**Level Mapping:** Tempus Senior AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML = Flatiron Health Senior = Foundation Medicine Senior

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Precision Medicine AI Engineer at Tempus builds AI that directly impacts cancer patient outcomes:
- **Multimodal Clinical Data:** Working with the world's largest clinical+molecular oncology dataset — genomics, transcriptomics, imaging, pathology, treatment outcomes
- **Real-Time Clinical Decision Support:** AI models deployed to oncologists at the point of care — your predictions influence treatment decisions for cancer patients
- **Clinical Trial Matching:** ML systems that match patients to optimal clinical trials, accelerating drug development and expanding treatment access
- **Next-Generation Diagnostics:** Building AI-powered diagnostic tools that identify biomarkers and predict treatment response

**Global Levers**

1. **Precision Medicine AI Scarcity:** "Engineers who combine production ML (transformers, multimodal learning, GNNs) with oncology domain expertise (genomic biomarkers, treatment pathways, clinical trial design) are the rarest talent in healthcare AI. My dual expertise eliminates the 12-18 month domain ramp that generic ML engineers face."
2. **Patient Outcome Impact:** "My AI models directly influence treatment decisions for cancer patients. This isn't ad optimization or content recommendation — it's clinical decision support where model accuracy has life-or-death consequences. The responsibility premium should be in the comp."
3. **Growth-Stage Equity Upside:** "Tempus went public at $6B+ valuation and is growing rapidly. My equity grants have meaningful upside potential as the company expands beyond oncology into cardiology, neurology, and infectious disease. Push for top-of-band equity to maximize participation in this growth."
4. **Competitive AI Market:** "Google Health, Recursion, Genentech, and Foundation Medicine are all hiring for similar roles. Tempus needs to compete with Big Tech AI comp for engineers who understand precision medicine."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $210K with equity at $175K/4yr and a 15% bonus target. I'm building the AI that directly impacts cancer patient outcomes — the signature value proposition of Tempus as a company. My precision medicine AI experience with [oncology ML / biomarker discovery / clinical decision support] means I deliver production AI from month one." Tempus will counter at $175K-$200K base with $100K-$150K equity. Accept if total comp exceeds $280K. Push hard on equity — growth-stage upside is the key lever. **Floor: $260K TC minimum for the signature AI role.**
