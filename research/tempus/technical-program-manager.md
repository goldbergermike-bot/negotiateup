**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Tempus drive complex, cross-functional programs spanning AI/ML engineering, data platform, clinical operations, pharma partnerships, and product development. Tempus's growth-stage environment means programs move fast, scope changes frequently, and TPMs must navigate ambiguity while maintaining execution quality. Programs include platform scaling initiatives (expanding from oncology to new disease areas), pharma partnership delivery programs (data analytics for drug development), clinical integration projects (embedding Tempus into hospital workflows), and infrastructure modernization. TPMs coordinate across data scientists, ML engineers, software engineers, clinical informaticists, and business development teams. The clinical context adds complexity — programs must satisfy HIPAA compliance, clinical data integrity requirements, and pharma partnership SLAs. [Source: Tempus Program Management 2025]
