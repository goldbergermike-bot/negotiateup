### Product Manager | Tempus Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** AI-Driven Precision Medicine / Growth-Stage / Equity Upside / Clinical Product Strategy

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Chicago IL | $150K–$210K | $65K–$170K/4yr | 10–15% | $195K–$305K |
| Bay Area CA | $160K–$220K | $70K–$180K/4yr | 10–15% | $210K–$320K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Tempus own the strategy for precision medicine products — Tempus One (physician clinical decision support), diagnostic products (genomic profiling, liquid biopsy), data products (sold to pharma partners), and clinical trial matching platforms. PMs at Tempus operate at the intersection of AI, oncology, and product strategy — making decisions about which clinical insights to surface, how to present AI recommendations to physicians, and which pharma partnership products to build. The role requires deep understanding of oncology workflows, precision medicine science, and the clinical evidence hierarchy. Tempus's growth-stage culture means PMs have broad scope, rapid iteration cycles, and direct influence on company strategy. Pharma partnership products are a key revenue driver, and PMs who can navigate pharma relationships while building clinically impactful products are especially valuable.

**Level Mapping:** Tempus PM = Google L4-L5 PM = Flatiron PM = Foundation Medicine PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Pharma Revenue Product Strategy:** "My product decisions directly impact pharma partnership revenue — Tempus's highest-margin business. Product strategy quality drives revenue growth."
2. **Growth-Stage Equity:** "PMs at growth-stage companies drive product-market fit and revenue growth. Push for top equity grants."
3. **Precision Medicine Domain:** "I bring oncology and precision medicine product expertise that general PMs lack."
4. **National PM Benchmark:** "Bench against national precision medicine and health tech market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with equity at $150K/4yr and a 15% bonus. My precision medicine product experience with [clinical decision support / pharma data products / oncology platforms] directly drives Tempus's product strategy." Tempus will counter at $170K-$195K base with $85K-$130K equity. Accept if total comp exceeds $260K. Push on equity.
