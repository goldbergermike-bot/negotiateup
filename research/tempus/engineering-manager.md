**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Tempus lead teams building the precision medicine platform that serves oncologists, pharmaceutical partners, and clinical trial networks. Tempus's growth-stage culture means EMs have broad scope, rapid headcount growth, and direct access to senior leadership. EMs must build and scale teams while maintaining the technical quality and clinical reliability of the platform. The role requires partnering with data scientists, clinical informaticists, and product leaders to translate precision medicine requirements into engineering deliverables. Tempus's mission-driven culture attracts strong talent, but retaining engineers in a competitive market requires strong EM leadership. Equity grants at the EM level are meaningful — Tempus's growth trajectory makes stock-based comp the highest-leverage variable. [Source: Tempus Engineering Leadership 2025]

**Global Levers**

1. **Growth-Stage EM Equity:** "EMs at growth-stage companies should receive significant equity — my team-building directly drives company scale and valuation. Push for $190K+ in equity."
2. **Rapid Scaling Leadership:** "Tempus is scaling across disease areas, requiring rapid team growth. EMs who can build high-performing teams quickly command a premium."
3. **Big Tech EM Competition:** "At the EM level, Tempus competes with Google, Meta, and established biotech. Comp should be competitive."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "EM bonus targets range 12-18%. Target 18%."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $230K with equity at $195K/4yr and an 18% bonus. I'm building and leading the engineering teams that power Tempus's precision medicine platform during its highest-growth phase." Tempus will counter at $195K-$220K base with $110K-$170K equity. Accept if total comp exceeds $310K. Push hard on equity.
