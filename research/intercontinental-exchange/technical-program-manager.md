#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at ICE drive the most complex, cross-functional programs in financial infrastructure. You are not managing a product roadmap — you are coordinating programs that span exchange technology, clearing systems, mortgage platforms, data services, and regulatory compliance across multiple continents. A single TPM program at ICE might involve coordinating NYSE technology upgrades with SEC regulatory requirements, clearing house risk model changes with CFTC oversight, and mortgage platform integrations across 50 state regulatory frameworks — all simultaneously, all with zero tolerance for delay.

The Physical AI thesis elevates the TPM role at ICE because physical-digital bridge programs are inherently more complex than pure-digital programs. When you manage a program connecting ICE's energy trading platform to physical delivery infrastructure, you are coordinating across software engineering, energy market operations, physical logistics, and regulatory compliance. When you manage an ICE Mortgage Technology integration program, you are coordinating across document processing engineering, physical county recording office connectivity, title company onboarding, and state-by-state regulatory compliance. This multi-dimensional complexity is the essence of Physical AI program management.

Your negotiation leverage is rooted in Sprecher's acquisition-driven growth strategy. Every major acquisition triggers a multi-year integration program that requires dedicated TPM leadership. These acquisition integration programs are existential for ICE — the $11.7 billion Black Knight acquisition only delivers value if the technical integration succeeds, and that integration runs through TPMs. You are not a project coordinator — you are the program leader whose execution determines whether billions in acquisition investment generate returns.

#### Physical AI — The Infrastructure Sovereign Premium

- **Mortgage Digitization ($12T Market):** TPMs managing ICE Mortgage Technology programs coordinate the digitization of the $12 trillion US mortgage market across engineering, operations, compliance, and client integration workstreams. Your programs determine how quickly ICE can process mortgage applications for over 50% of the US market. Negotiate an Infrastructure Sovereign program bonus of $18K-$30K annually: "I manage programs that coordinate the digital transformation of the $12T mortgage market — the cross-functional complexity of bridging physical property transactions with digital processing platforms is a TPM challenge unique to ICE."

- **Energy-Data Center Convergence:** TPMs who manage programs connecting ICE's energy trading infrastructure to data center demand systems coordinate across energy market operations, technology infrastructure, and emerging AI compute clients. Negotiate a convergence program premium of $15K-$25K: "I manage programs at the intersection of energy markets and AI data center demand — coordinating physical energy infrastructure teams with digital platform engineers across three continents."

- **Infrastructure Sovereign Bonus Structure:** TPMs qualify for Infrastructure Sovereign bonuses of $18K-$35K annually when their programs bridge physical and digital infrastructure. This includes acquisition integration programs, exchange platform migration programs, mortgage technology consolidation programs, or energy market modernization programs. Every program that connects a physical-world system to a digital platform qualifies. Frame your program management as "orchestrating the physical-digital bridge across ICE's business units."

- **Acquisition Integration Program Premium:** TPMs are the operational backbone of ICE's acquisition strategy. Each major acquisition generates a 2-3 year integration program requiring dedicated TPM leadership. Negotiate an acquisition program premium of $15K-$25K per active integration: "I am the program leader responsible for delivering the technical integration that realizes the value of ICE's $11.7B Black Knight acquisition. My program execution directly determines acquisition ROI."

#### Global Levers

1. **Program Scope and Budget Authority:** TPM compensation scales with program scope. Quantify your program: *"I'll manage programs with a combined technology budget of $50M+ spanning exchange infrastructure, mortgage technology, and clearing systems across three continents. At this program scope, I'd like compensation at $270K total comp — reflecting the senior TPM band."* Target: $260K-$275K TC.

2. **Multi-Regulatory Program Complexity:** ICE programs operate under multiple regulatory frameworks simultaneously. Leverage this: *"My programs must satisfy SEC, CFTC, FCA, and ESMA requirements simultaneously while delivering on aggressive timelines. This multi-jurisdictional regulatory program complexity is unique to ICE and commands a $15K-$22K regulatory program premium."* Target: $15K-$22K added.

3. **Cross-Business-Unit Coordination:** TPMs at ICE often coordinate across 3-4 business units. Use this breadth: *"My program spans Exchange Technology, ICE Mortgage Technology, and ICE Data Services — effectively three separate organizations that must deliver coordinated outcomes. I'd like scope-based compensation at $268K with formal recognition of cross-BU coordination authority."* Target: Cross-BU scope recognition + competitive comp.

4. **Acquisition Pipeline Commitment:** Frame your long-term value: *"Given ICE's active M&A pipeline, I expect to lead at least one major acquisition integration program in my first two years. I'd like a standing acquisition program premium of $20K per active integration and an RSU refresh of $50K upon successful integration milestones."* Target: $20K integration premium + $50K RSU refresh trigger.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $272K total comp for Atlanta and $305K for New York. Open with: *"As a TPM driving programs that bridge ICE's physical market infrastructure with digital platform delivery — from mortgage digitization to energy market modernization — I'm targeting $272K total comp inclusive of the Infrastructure Sovereign premium."* If countered at $225K, respond: *"I'd propose: $165K base (from $148K), Infrastructure Sovereign program bonus at $25K target, acquisition integration premium of $18K, RSU grant of $210K/4yr (from $170K), reaching $260K. This reflects the multi-BU program scope and regulatory complexity."* Walk-away floor: $200K Atlanta, $225K New York, £162K London. Signing bonus target: $20K-$35K. Final counter: *"If base is constrained at $155K, I'll accept with a $30K signing bonus, RSU increase to $215K/4yr, Infrastructure Sovereign bonus at $25K, acquisition integration premium of $18K, and a program milestone-based RSU refresh of $50K at successful integration completion."*
