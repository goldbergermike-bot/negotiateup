#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at ICE build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers the world's most important financial markets. ICE generates and processes an extraordinary volume of market data: real-time price feeds from NYSE and ICE Futures exchanges, clearing and settlement data for trillions in notional derivatives, mortgage application data covering over half the US market, and energy commodity pricing data used by producers, utilities, and traders worldwide. The scale is staggering — NYSE alone generates hundreds of millions of messages per day, and ICE's energy markets produce pricing data for commodities that power the global economy.

The Physical AI thesis makes Data Engineering at ICE uniquely compelling. Your data pipelines do not just move digital records — they ingest, transform, and deliver data that represents physical-world phenomena. Energy pricing data references actual pipeline flow rates, storage levels, and weather conditions. Mortgage data references actual properties, physical documents, and real estate market conditions. Commodity data references actual delivery schedules, warehouse receipts, and transportation logistics. As a Data Engineer, you are building the data infrastructure that makes the physical world legible to digital markets.

ICE Data Services is a standalone business unit generating hundreds of millions in annual revenue by monetizing ICE's proprietary data through subscription feeds, analytics products, and benchmark pricing services. Data Engineers who build the pipelines feeding ICE Data Services products are directly contributing to a major revenue stream. Your data infrastructure is not a cost center — it is the production system for one of ICE's highest-margin businesses. This revenue-generating role is your negotiation lever.

#### Physical AI — The Infrastructure Sovereign Premium

- **Mortgage Digitization ($12T Market):** Data Engineers building pipelines for ICE Mortgage Technology process data from over 50% of US mortgage applications. Your data infrastructure handles loan applications, credit reports, property appraisals, title documents, and closing records for the $12 trillion mortgage market. Negotiate an Infrastructure Sovereign data bonus of $18K-$28K annually: "My data pipelines process the financial records of the $12T US mortgage market — every loan application, every credit decision, every property record flows through infrastructure I build and maintain."

- **Energy-Data Center Convergence:** Data Engineers who build pipelines connecting ICE's energy market data to data center demand analytics are creating the data infrastructure for the Physical AI economy. As AI compute demand drives unprecedented energy consumption, ICE's energy pricing data becomes critical for data center operators. Negotiate a convergence data premium of $15K-$25K: "I build the data pipelines that connect energy market pricing to AI data center demand forecasting — the data infrastructure bridge between physical energy markets and digital compute planning."

- **Infrastructure Sovereign Bonus Structure:** Data Engineers qualify for Infrastructure Sovereign bonuses of $18K-$35K annually when their data infrastructure bridges physical and digital systems. This includes market data feed pipelines, mortgage document processing pipelines, energy data ingestion from physical metering systems, or commodity data streams from warehouse and delivery systems. Frame every pipeline as "the data bridge between physical-world events and digital market intelligence."

- **Data Revenue Attribution Premium:** ICE Data Services monetizes data infrastructure through subscription products. Data Engineers whose pipelines directly feed revenue-generating data products earn a data revenue premium of $12K-$22K. Position this: "My data pipelines are the production infrastructure for ICE Data Services products generating $150M+ in annual subscription revenue. The reliability and quality of my pipelines directly affect ICE's data revenue."

#### Global Levers

1. **Data Volume and Velocity Premium:** ICE's data infrastructure operates at extraordinary scale. Use volume metrics: *"I'll build pipelines processing hundreds of millions of messages per day from NYSE alone, plus energy pricing, mortgage, and clearing data across ICE's global platforms. At this data velocity, I'd like compensation at $272K total comp reflecting the engineering complexity."* Target: $265K-$278K TC.

2. **Real-Time Streaming Expertise:** ICE requires ultra-low-latency data delivery for trading platforms. Negotiate for this expertise: *"My experience with real-time streaming architectures — sub-millisecond data delivery, exactly-once semantics, at-scale state management — directly supports ICE's exchange data feed requirements. I'd like a $15K-$22K streaming infrastructure premium."* Target: $15K-$22K added.

3. **Data Quality and Regulatory Compliance:** Financial data must meet strict regulatory accuracy standards. Leverage this: *"ICE's data feeds are used as regulatory benchmarks and legal references for contract settlement. The data quality standards I maintain are not just engineering goals — they're regulatory mandates from SEC, CFTC, and ESMA. I'd like a $12K-$18K regulatory data quality premium."* Target: $12K-$18K added.

4. **Multi-Platform Data Unification:** ICE's acquisitions create disparate data platforms that need consolidation. Frame your role as strategic: *"ICE needs to unify data infrastructure across NYSE, ICE Futures, ICE Mortgage Technology, and acquired platforms like Black Knight into a coherent data fabric. I'd like to discuss data platform unification scope at senior-band compensation of $275K with an RSU refresh commitment upon successful unification milestones."* Target: Senior-band comp + milestone-based RSU refresh.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $275K total comp for Atlanta and $308K for New York. Open with: *"As a Data Engineer building the data infrastructure that bridges ICE's physical market data with digital platform delivery — from energy pricing to mortgage records — I'm targeting $275K total comp inclusive of the Infrastructure Sovereign premium."* If countered at $225K, respond: *"I'd propose: $168K base (from $148K), Infrastructure Sovereign data bonus at $25K target, data revenue attribution premium of $15K, RSU grant of $210K/4yr (from $175K), reaching $260K. This reflects the data velocity requirements and revenue-generating nature of ICE's data infrastructure."* Walk-away floor: $200K Atlanta, $225K New York, £162K London. Signing bonus target: $20K-$35K. Final counter: *"If base is firm at $155K, I'll accept with a $30K signing bonus, RSU increase to $220K/4yr, Infrastructure Sovereign bonus at $25K, data revenue premium of $15K, and a platform unification milestone RSU refresh of $40K. Year 1 effective comp: $270K."*
