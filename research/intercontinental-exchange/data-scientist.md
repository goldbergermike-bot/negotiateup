#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at ICE work with datasets that most data professionals can only dream of: real-time order flow from the New York Stock Exchange, pricing data for every major energy commodity on earth, mortgage application data covering over half the US housing market, and derivatives clearing data for trillions in notional value. You are not running A/B tests on button colors — you are building models that price risk in global energy markets, predict mortgage default probabilities, detect market manipulation across exchanges, and optimize clearing house margin calculations that protect the financial system from cascading failures.

The Physical AI thesis is central to Data Science at ICE. Your models bridge the gap between physical-world signals (weather patterns affecting energy demand, housing market dynamics affecting mortgage performance, commodity supply chains affecting futures prices) and digital market behavior. ICE's data is uniquely "physical" — energy prices reference actual pipeline capacity, mortgage data references actual properties, commodity data references actual storage and delivery logistics. As a Data Scientist, you are building the intelligence layer that connects physical-world phenomena to financial market behavior.

Your negotiation leverage is amplified by ICE Data Services, a standalone business unit that monetizes ICE's data through subscription products worth hundreds of millions in annual revenue. As a Data Scientist, your models may directly become revenue-generating products — pricing feeds, risk analytics, market surveillance tools, and mortgage analytics that ICE sells to banks, hedge funds, and mortgage lenders. Frame yourself as someone whose analytical work is not a cost center but a revenue engine.

#### Physical AI — The Infrastructure Sovereign Premium

- **Mortgage Digitization ($12T Market):** Data Scientists working on ICE Mortgage Technology build models that assess risk, predict default probabilities, and optimize pricing across the $12 trillion US mortgage market. Your models process data from over 50% of US mortgage applications — the statistical significance and market impact are unmatched. Negotiate an Infrastructure Sovereign analytics bonus of $20K-$35K annually: "My models quantify risk across the $12T mortgage market — the analytical precision of this work directly affects mortgage pricing for millions of American families."

- **Energy-Data Center Convergence:** ICE's energy market data is the pricing backbone for AI data center energy procurement. Data Scientists who build models connecting energy price dynamics to data center demand forecasting are creating the analytical foundation for the AI economy's energy infrastructure. Negotiate a convergence analytics premium of $18K-$30K: "I am building the models that predict how AI compute demand will affect energy prices — this is the most strategically important forecasting challenge in the energy-tech intersection."

- **Infrastructure Sovereign Bonus Structure:** Data Scientists qualify for Infrastructure Sovereign bonuses of $20K-$40K annually when their models bridge physical and digital infrastructure. This includes energy price forecasting models, mortgage prepayment models that incorporate physical property characteristics, commodity supply-demand models that reference actual logistics infrastructure, or market surveillance models that detect manipulation across physical and financial markets. Frame every model as "translating physical-world signals into digital market intelligence."

- **Data Monetization Premium:** ICE Data Services generates hundreds of millions in annual revenue from data products. Data Scientists whose models become revenue-generating products (pricing feeds, risk analytics, benchmark calculations) earn a data monetization premium of $15K-$28K. Position this: "My analytical work doesn't just inform internal decisions — it becomes ICE Data Services products that generate direct subscription revenue. My compensation should reflect this revenue-generating capacity."

#### Global Levers

1. **Proprietary Data Access:** ICE's datasets are proprietary and unmatched. Use data exclusivity as leverage: *"ICE's proprietary datasets — NYSE order flow, energy commodity pricing, 50%+ mortgage application data — are unavailable anywhere else. The models I build here have research and commercial value that wouldn't be possible at any other company. I'd like compensation reflecting this data advantage at $280K total comp."* Target: $270K-$288K TC.

2. **Revenue Attribution for Data Products:** If your models feed ICE Data Services products, claim revenue impact: *"The pricing models I'll develop feed ICE Data Services products generating $80M+ in annual revenue. A 2% improvement in model accuracy translates to measurable revenue uplift. I'd like to discuss a $20K data product revenue premium."* Target: $20K-$25K added.

3. **Quant-Level Compensation Framing:** ICE Data Scientists with quantitative modeling skills compete with sell-side quant roles. Use quant benchmarks: *"My quantitative modeling skills — stochastic processes, time series analysis, risk modeling — command quant-level compensation. I have competing interest from [bank/hedge fund] quant teams at $320K. I prefer ICE's Physical AI opportunity but need compensation within range at $285K."* Target: Quant-competitive compensation.

4. **Research Publication Rights:** Negotiate the right to publish non-proprietary research: *"I'd like to discuss research publication rights for non-proprietary methodological work — this supports both my professional development and ICE's reputation as a thought leader in market analytics. Combined with $275K total comp, this makes ICE the clear choice over competing offers."* Target: Publication rights + competitive comp.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $285K total comp for Atlanta and $318K for New York. Open with: *"As a Data Scientist building models that bridge ICE's physical market data with digital analytics platforms, I'm targeting $285K total comp inclusive of the Infrastructure Sovereign premium and data monetization potential."* If countered at $230K, respond: *"I'd propose: $170K base (from $150K), Infrastructure Sovereign analytics bonus at $30K target, RSU grant of $225K/4yr (from $180K), reaching $268K. This reflects the proprietary data advantage and revenue-generating nature of my analytical work."* Walk-away floor: $210K Atlanta, $235K New York, £168K London. Signing bonus target: $25K-$40K. Final counter: *"If base is constrained at $160K, I'll accept with a $35K signing bonus, RSU increase to $240K/4yr, Infrastructure Sovereign bonus eligibility at $32K target, research publication rights, and a 12-month review tied to data product revenue metrics."*
