#### Negotiation DNA

Product Managers at ICE do not build products for consumers — they build products for the global financial system. Your users are banks, broker-dealers, mortgage lenders, energy traders, and central counterparties. Your product decisions affect market structure, regulatory compliance, and systemic risk. A single feature you ship could change how trillions of dollars in derivatives are cleared, how millions of mortgages are processed, or how energy prices are discovered for an entire continent. This is product management at the highest stakes.

The Physical AI thesis gives Product Managers at ICE a unique strategic lens. ICE's product portfolio spans the physical-digital divide: energy futures contracts that reference physical delivery points, mortgage technology that digitizes physical property transactions, and exchange platforms that convert physical trading floor activities into electronic workflows. As a Product Manager, you define how these physical-world processes become digital products — you are the strategic architect of ICE's Physical AI transformation.

ICE's acquisition-driven growth under Sprecher creates a product integration challenge that is your negotiation lever. Every acquisition (Ellie Mae, Black Knight, Simplifile, MERSCORP, IDC) brings a product portfolio that must be unified with ICE's existing offerings. Product Managers who can rationalize overlapping product lines, identify cross-sell opportunities across business units, and design integrated platform experiences are extraordinarily valuable. Position yourself as the PM who "turns twenty acquired products into one platform."

#### Physical AI — The Infrastructure Sovereign Premium

- **Mortgage Digitization ($12T Market):** Product Managers owning ICE Mortgage Technology products manage the digital transformation of the $12 trillion US mortgage market. Your product decisions determine how 50%+ of US mortgage applications are processed — from origination through closing and servicing. Negotiate an Infrastructure Sovereign product bonus of $20K-$35K annually: "I am defining the product strategy for the platform that digitizes the largest asset class in America. My roadmap decisions directly affect $6 trillion in annual mortgage origination volume."

- **Energy-Data Center Convergence:** Product Managers who define ICE's energy data products at the intersection of energy markets and AI data center demand are creating entirely new product categories. As AI compute drives unprecedented energy demand, ICE's energy market data becomes critical infrastructure. Negotiate a convergence product premium of $15K-$28K: "I'm building the product that connects energy market intelligence to data center capacity planning — a product category that didn't exist two years ago and will be worth billions."

- **Infrastructure Sovereign Bonus Structure:** Product Managers qualify for Infrastructure Sovereign bonuses of $20K-$40K annually when their product work bridges physical and digital infrastructure. This includes defining product strategy for e-closing platforms, energy market data APIs, exchange connectivity products, or clearing risk dashboards. Frame every product initiative as a "physical-digital bridge product" to maximize bonus eligibility.

- **Cross-Platform Product Rationalization Premium:** ICE's acquisitions create overlapping product lines that need rationalization. Product Managers who lead cross-platform product strategy earn rationalization premiums of $15K-$25K. Position this during negotiation: "My experience in product portfolio rationalization directly supports ICE's post-acquisition integration strategy — I can identify the $50M+ in product synergies that justify these acquisitions."

#### Global Levers

1. **Revenue Ownership Framing:** ICE Product Managers often own products with direct revenue attribution. Use P&L language: *"The product I'll own generates $120M+ in annual revenue across mortgage technology data services. Given direct revenue ownership, I'd like to discuss compensation at $290K total comp — a fraction of the revenue my product decisions influence."* Target: $280K-$295K TC.

2. **Regulatory Product Expertise:** ICE's products must comply with SEC, CFTC, ESMA, and FCA regulations. Product Managers with regulatory expertise are scarce: *"I bring regulatory product expertise that ensures my roadmap decisions are both commercially optimal and fully compliant across SEC, CFTC, and FCA frameworks. This dual competency is rare and commands a premium — I'm targeting a $20K regulatory product premium."* Target: $20K-$25K added.

3. **B2B Enterprise Product Premium:** Unlike consumer PMs, ICE Product Managers manage products sold to sophisticated institutional buyers (banks, brokers, lenders). Negotiate for this complexity: *"Managing enterprise products for institutional financial clients requires domain expertise that takes years to develop. I'd like my compensation to reflect the B2B enterprise product premium at $275K total comp."* Target: $265K-$295K TC.

4. **Acquisition Product Integration Scope:** Frame your role as acquisition-critical: *"With ICE's active M&A pipeline, I expect to lead product integration for at least one major acquisition in my first two years. I'd like a $15K acquisition integration bonus and RSU refresh of $40K upon successful product integration milestones."* Target: $15K bonus + $40K RSU refresh trigger.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $290K total comp for Atlanta and $325K for New York. Open with: *"As a Product Manager defining ICE's physical-digital product strategy across mortgage technology and market infrastructure, I'm targeting $290K total comp inclusive of the Infrastructure Sovereign premium."* If countered at $240K, respond: *"I'd propose bridging the gap through: $170K base (from $155K), Infrastructure Sovereign product bonus at $28K target, RSU grant of $230K/4yr (from $190K), reaching $275K. This reflects the revenue scope and regulatory complexity of this PM role."* Walk-away floor: $215K Atlanta, $240K New York, £172K London. Signing bonus target: $25K-$40K. Final counter: *"If base is capped at $160K, I'll accept with a $35K signing bonus, $240K RSU/4yr, written Infrastructure Sovereign bonus eligibility at $30K target, and a product milestone-based RSU refresh of $40K at the 12-month mark."*
