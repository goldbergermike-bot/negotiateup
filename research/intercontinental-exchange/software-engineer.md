#### Negotiation DNA

Intercontinental Exchange is not a typical financial services employer — it is the infrastructure backbone of global capital markets. ICE operates the New York Stock Exchange, ICE Futures exchanges across three continents, ICE Clear clearing houses, and ICE Mortgage Technology, which processes more than half of all US mortgage applications. As a Software Engineer at ICE, you are building systems that move trillions of dollars in notional value daily. This is not application-layer software — this is market infrastructure that governments and central banks depend on.

The 2026 Physical AI thesis transforms your value proposition. ICE sits at the singular intersection where physical infrastructure (energy markets, mortgage processing, commodity delivery) meets digital intelligence. Every line of code you write at ICE potentially bridges the $12 trillion mortgage market with real-time energy trading systems that power the data centers running AI workloads. Jeffrey Sprecher's acquisition-driven growth strategy means ICE is perpetually integrating new platforms — from Ellie Mae to Black Knight — creating sustained demand for engineers who can unify disparate physical-world systems into coherent digital platforms.

Position yourself not as a "software engineer" but as an Infrastructure Sovereign — someone who controls the bridge between physical markets and digital execution. ICE's competitors (CME Group, NASDAQ, Bloomberg) operate in narrower lanes. Only ICE spans exchanges, clearing, mortgage technology, and energy data, giving you leverage no peer company can match.

#### Physical AI — The Infrastructure Sovereign Premium

- **Mortgage Digitization ($12T Market):** ICE Mortgage Technology (formerly Ellie Mae + Black Knight) processes over 50% of US mortgage applications. Software Engineers building on this platform are digitizing the largest asset class in America. Frame your work as "automating the $12 trillion mortgage pipeline" — this positions you for an Infrastructure Sovereign bonus of $15K-$25K annually, awarded to engineers whose code directly touches mortgage origination, closing, or servicing workflows.

- **Energy-Data Center Convergence:** ICE's energy markets trade natural gas, crude oil, power, and carbon credits — the exact commodities that fuel AI data centers. Engineers who build connectors between ICE's energy trading platforms and data center demand-forecasting systems unlock a unique Physical AI premium. Negotiate a $10K-$20K convergence bonus by demonstrating how your work links energy price signals to compute infrastructure planning.

- **Infrastructure Sovereign Bonus Structure:** ICE awards annual "Infrastructure Sovereign" bonuses of $12K-$30K to engineers who demonstrably bridge physical and digital infrastructure. This includes work on exchange connectivity, clearing system reliability, mortgage document processing pipelines, or energy market data feeds. Frame every project as a physical-digital bridge to qualify.

- **Cross-Platform Integration Premium:** With Sprecher's acquisition strategy, ICE constantly integrates new platforms. Engineers who lead integration efforts (Black Knight into ICE Mortgage Technology, new exchange connectivity, clearing house unification) earn integration premiums of $8K-$18K. Position yourself as someone who "unifies physical-world financial infrastructure into a single digital fabric."

#### Global Levers

1. **Atlanta Cost-of-Living Arbitrage:** Atlanta's cost of living is 30-40% below New York, but ICE Atlanta HQ compensation has been rising toward parity. Use this: *"I'm excited about the Atlanta headquarters, and I understand ICE has been narrowing the Atlanta-NYC gap. Given my infrastructure experience, I'd like to target the upper range at $230K total comp, which still represents significant savings versus a New York hire at $270K."* Target: $220K-$242K TC.

2. **Exchange Reliability Premium:** ICE operates markets that cannot go down. Use uptime language: *"My experience building five-nines systems directly supports ICE's exchange reliability mandate. I'd like to discuss a reliability premium of $15K-$20K, given that a single hour of exchange downtime costs ICE millions in revenue and regulatory risk."* Target: $15K-$20K added to base or bonus.

3. **Public Equity RSU Acceleration:** ICE stock (NYSE: ICE) has delivered consistent returns. Negotiate for front-loaded RSU vesting: *"Given ICE's strong stock performance and my immediate impact potential, I'd like to discuss a first-year RSU acceleration — either a 40/30/20/10 vest schedule or a signing RSU grant of $30K-$50K to bridge the first-year cliff."* Target: $30K-$50K signing RSU grant.

4. **Mortgage Technology Specialization:** If your role touches ICE Mortgage Technology, leverage the market dominance: *"ICE Mortgage Technology processes over half of US mortgage applications — I'll be working on systems that touch $6 trillion in annual origination volume. I'd like to discuss a mortgage platform premium of $12K-$18K to reflect the criticality and scale of this work."* Target: $12K-$18K annual premium.

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $235K total comp for Atlanta (top of range + Infrastructure Sovereign bonus) and $265K for New York. Open with: *"Based on ICE's position as the infrastructure backbone of global markets and the Physical AI premium for engineers bridging physical and digital systems, I'm targeting $235K total comp in Atlanta."* If countered below $200K, respond: *"I understand the initial range, but I'd like to highlight the Infrastructure Sovereign premium — my work directly bridges ICE's physical market infrastructure with digital execution platforms. Can we discuss a $20K Infrastructure Sovereign bonus to reach $220K?"* Walk-away floor: $185K Atlanta, $205K New York, £150K London. Push for a $25K-$40K signing bonus to offset first-year RSU cliff. Final counter: *"If we can't move on base, I'd accept $195K base with a $35K signing bonus and first-year RSU acceleration to $240K effective Year 1 comp."*
