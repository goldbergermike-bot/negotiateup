#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at ICE operate at the most strategically important frontier in financial infrastructure. ICE's competitive advantage in the 2026 landscape is defined by how effectively it deploys artificial intelligence across its exchange, clearing, mortgage, and energy platforms. You are not building AI for a social media feed — you are building AI that detects market manipulation across the world's largest stock exchange, automates mortgage underwriting for over half the US market, predicts energy commodity prices that affect the cost of powering AI data centers, and optimizes clearing house risk models that protect the financial system from cascading failures.

The Physical AI thesis is most literally embodied in the ML/AI Engineer role. You are building AI models that understand physical-world phenomena and translate them into financial market intelligence. Your computer vision models read physical mortgage documents — handwritten signatures, notary stamps, property photographs. Your NLP models parse physical legal documents — title records, county filings, regulatory disclosures. Your predictive models forecast physical commodity delivery — pipeline flow rates, storage utilization, weather-driven demand. This is AI that must understand the physical world, not just digital data.

Your negotiation leverage is amplified by the AI talent war. ML/AI Engineers with financial infrastructure experience are among the most sought-after professionals in technology. Big Tech, AI startups, hedge funds, and financial infrastructure companies all compete for the same talent pool. ICE must pay competitively with Google, Meta, and OpenAI — while offering the unique Physical AI differentiation that pure-tech companies cannot match. Frame your negotiation as choosing ICE's Physical AI mission over Big Tech's consumer AI — but requiring competitive compensation to make that choice.

#### Physical AI — The Infrastructure Sovereign Premium

- **Mortgage Digitization ($12T Market):** ML/AI Engineers working on ICE Mortgage Technology are building the AI that automates the $12 trillion US mortgage market. Your models perform document understanding on physical mortgage documents (reading handwritten applications, extracting data from scanned title reports, verifying signatures on closing documents), automated underwriting (assessing borrower risk across millions of applications), and fraud detection (identifying document forgery and application fraud). Negotiate an Infrastructure Sovereign AI bonus of $35K-$55K annually: "My AI models automate decisions across the $12T mortgage market — from document understanding to underwriting to fraud detection. Each model improvement affects mortgage processing for millions of American families."

- **Energy-Data Center Convergence:** ML/AI Engineers who build predictive models for ICE's energy markets are creating the AI that forecasts energy prices for the data centers running AI workloads. This is recursively self-referential Physical AI — your AI predicts the energy costs of running AI. Negotiate a convergence AI premium of $30K-$45K: "I build the AI models that predict energy prices for the data centers that run AI workloads — this recursive Physical AI challenge is unique to ICE and represents the most strategically important modeling work in the energy-tech intersection."

- **Infrastructure Sovereign Bonus Structure:** ML/AI Engineers qualify for the highest-tier Infrastructure Sovereign bonuses: $35K-$60K annually. At this level, bonuses are tied to model deployment outcomes — improvements in mortgage automation rates, accuracy of energy price predictions, reduction in false positives for market surveillance, or optimization of clearing risk models. Every deployed model that bridges physical-world understanding with digital market intelligence qualifies. Request explicit model-outcome bonus metrics: "I'd like my Infrastructure Sovereign bonus tied to specific model performance metrics — mortgage automation rate improvement, energy forecast accuracy, or market surveillance precision."

- **AI Talent Retention Premium:** ICE competes with Big Tech for ML/AI talent. Engineers who choose ICE over Google, Meta, or OpenAI earn an AI talent retention premium of $25K-$40K, structured as an annual retention bonus above standard compensation. Position this explicitly: "I am choosing ICE's Physical AI mission over competing offers from [Big Tech/AI startup] that offer $50K+ more in base compensation. The AI talent retention premium should bridge this gap while reflecting my commitment to ICE's Physical AI thesis."

#### Global Levers

1. **Big Tech Competitive Anchoring:** ML/AI Engineers can anchor against Big Tech compensation. Use explicit comparisons: *"My competing offers from [Google/Meta/Amazon] ML teams are in the $420K-$480K total comp range. I'm choosing ICE for the Physical AI opportunity, but I need compensation within 15% of Big Tech — I'm targeting $392K total comp in Atlanta."* Target: $380K-$392K TC.

2. **Model Revenue Impact:** If your models feed ICE Data Services products or improve mortgage automation rates, quantify the impact: *"My document understanding models will increase mortgage automation rates from 65% to 80%, reducing manual processing costs by $30M+ annually. I'd like a $25K-$35K model impact bonus tied to automation rate improvements."* Target: $25K-$35K model impact bonus.

3. **Research and Compute Budget:** ML/AI Engineers need significant compute resources. Negotiate for this: *"I'd like to confirm a dedicated ML compute budget of $200K-$400K annually for model training, experimentation, and deployment infrastructure. Additionally, I'd like conference attendance and publication support for 3-4 top-tier ML conferences annually."* Target: Secure dedicated compute budget and conference support.

4. **Patent and IP Compensation:** AI innovations at ICE may be patentable. Negotiate for IP recognition: *"My ML innovations may generate patentable intellectual property. I'd like confirmation of ICE's patent bonus program ($5K-$15K per filed patent) and written agreement that I will be named as inventor on patents derived from my work."* Target: Patent bonus confirmation + inventor naming rights.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $390K total comp for Atlanta and $435K for New York. Open with: *"As an ML/AI Engineer building Physical AI models that bridge ICE's physical market infrastructure with intelligent automation — from mortgage document understanding to energy price prediction — I'm targeting $390K total comp, competitive with Big Tech ML roles while reflecting ICE's Physical AI premium."* If countered at $310K, respond: *"I appreciate the offer but need to close the gap with competing Big Tech offers. I'd propose: $235K base (from $200K), Infrastructure Sovereign AI bonus at $50K target, AI talent retention premium of $30K, RSU grant of $320K/4yr (from $260K), reaching $375K. This keeps ICE within 10% of Big Tech alternatives."* Walk-away floor: $280K Atlanta, $315K New York, £225K London. Signing bonus target: $40K-$65K. Final counter: *"If base is constrained at $215K, I'll accept with a $60K signing bonus, RSU increase to $340K/4yr with 35% Year 1 vest, Infrastructure Sovereign AI bonus at $50K, AI talent retention premium of $30K, and a $300K annual ML compute budget. Year 1 effective comp: $400K."*
