#### Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at ICE face a design challenge unlike any in consumer technology: your users are professional traders executing million-dollar positions in milliseconds, mortgage loan officers processing applications under regulatory deadlines, and risk managers monitoring clearing house exposures worth billions. These users do not tolerate friction — a poorly designed interface in a trading platform can cost a user millions in a single session. A confusing mortgage application workflow can delay thousands of home closings. Design at ICE is not about aesthetics — it is about precision under pressure.

The Physical AI thesis creates a fascinating design challenge. ICE's platforms must represent physical-world complexity (energy delivery schedules, property title chains, commodity storage logistics) through digital interfaces that are intuitive enough for rapid decision-making. You are designing the visual and interaction layer that bridges physical infrastructure and digital execution. When a trader views an energy futures curve on your interface, they are making decisions about physical natural gas delivery at actual pipeline interconnection points. When a loan officer uses your mortgage platform, they are guiding a family through the largest financial transaction of their lives involving a physical property.

Your negotiation leverage comes from the rarity of enterprise financial UX expertise. Consumer designers are plentiful; designers who understand order books, clearing workflows, mortgage origination pipelines, and energy market dynamics are exceptionally scarce. ICE's acquisition history means multiple design systems need unification — this is a strategic design leadership opportunity that commands premium compensation.

#### Physical AI — The Infrastructure Sovereign Premium

- **Mortgage Digitization ($12T Market):** Product Designers on ICE Mortgage Technology are designing the interface through which over 50% of US mortgage applications are processed. Your design decisions determine how loan officers, underwriters, and borrowers experience the $12 trillion mortgage market. Negotiate an Infrastructure Sovereign design bonus of $12K-$22K annually: "I am designing the interface for the largest financial transaction most Americans will ever make — the experience layer for the $12T mortgage market demands a premium."

- **Energy-Data Center Convergence:** Designers who create dashboards and visualization tools connecting ICE's energy market data to data center demand planning are building interfaces for a new category of Physical AI users. Negotiate a convergence design premium of $10K-$18K: "I'm designing the visual intelligence layer that connects energy commodity markets to AI infrastructure planning — a design surface that requires both financial visualization expertise and data center domain knowledge."

- **Infrastructure Sovereign Bonus Structure:** Product Designers qualify for Infrastructure Sovereign bonuses of $12K-$25K annually when their design work bridges physical and digital infrastructure. This includes designing trading interfaces that visualize physical delivery, mortgage platforms that digitize paper-based processes, or energy dashboards that connect market prices to physical grid conditions. Frame every design project as "making the physical world legible through digital interfaces."

- **Design System Unification Premium:** ICE's acquisitions have created multiple disparate design systems across NYSE, ICE Mortgage Technology, ICE Data Services, and ICE Futures. Designers who lead design system unification earn a premium of $10K-$18K. Position this: "I will unify the design language across ICE's acquired platforms into a coherent design system — this design infrastructure work is foundational to ICE's platform strategy."

#### Global Levers

1. **Enterprise Design Scarcity:** Financial enterprise UX designers are far scarcer than consumer designers. Use market scarcity: *"Enterprise financial UX expertise — understanding order books, clearing workflows, and regulatory interfaces — takes years to develop. The talent pool is a fraction of consumer design. I'd like my compensation to reflect this scarcity at $225K total comp."* Target: $215K-$228K TC.

2. **User Impact at Scale:** ICE's platforms serve hundreds of thousands of professional users. Quantify your impact: *"My designs will be used by 200,000+ mortgage professionals processing $6 trillion in annual origination volume. The revenue impact of a 5% improvement in user efficiency is measured in hundreds of millions. I'd like a $15K design impact premium."* Target: $15K-$20K added.

3. **Research and Usability Budget:** Negotiate for design research resources as part of your compensation package: *"I'd like to confirm a dedicated research budget of $50K-$75K annually for usability studies, user interviews, and design validation — this is a multiplier on my design effectiveness and should be considered part of the total value proposition."* Target: Secure dedicated research budget.

4. **Design Leadership Path:** Frame your trajectory toward design leadership: *"I see a path from Product Designer to Design Lead within 18 months, given ICE's need to unify acquired design systems. I'd like to start at $220K total comp with a written commitment to review for Design Lead promotion and associated compensation increase at the 12-month mark."* Target: Built-in promotion review.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $225K total comp for Atlanta and $250K for New York. Open with: *"As a Product Designer specializing in enterprise financial UX and Physical AI interface design, I'm targeting $225K total comp inclusive of the Infrastructure Sovereign design premium."* If countered at $180K, respond: *"I'd bridge the gap through: $140K base (from $125K), Infrastructure Sovereign design bonus at $18K target, RSU grant of $170K/4yr (from $140K), reaching $210K. This reflects the enterprise design scarcity and the regulatory interface complexity of ICE's products."* Walk-away floor: $165K Atlanta, $185K New York, £132K London. Signing bonus target: $15K-$25K. Final counter: *"If base is firm at $130K, I'll accept with a $22K signing bonus, RSU increase to $175K/4yr, Infrastructure Sovereign bonus eligibility at $18K, and a design research budget of $60K annually. Effective Year 1 comp: $215K."*
