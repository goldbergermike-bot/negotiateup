#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at ICE operate at the intersection of technical excellence and business-critical infrastructure management. You are not managing a team building consumer features — you are leading engineers who keep the world's most important financial markets running. Your team's code executes NYSE trades, clears derivatives positions worth billions, processes mortgage applications for half the US housing market, and prices the energy commodities that power the global economy. A single outage on your watch can trigger regulatory investigations, congressional hearings, and front-page headlines.

The Physical AI dimension amplifies your management role. ICE's unique position bridging physical infrastructure (energy delivery, property transactions, commodity storage) and digital markets means your teams work on problems that pure-tech companies never encounter. Your engineers must understand physical delivery logistics for oil contracts, real estate title chains for mortgage processing, and power grid dynamics for energy trading. Managing this hybrid physical-digital engineering workforce requires a rare combination of technical depth, domain expertise, and people leadership.

Your negotiation leverage is rooted in the scarcity of engineering managers who can lead teams across ICE's diverse business units while maintaining the regulatory compliance, uptime guarantees, and latency requirements that financial infrastructure demands. Sprecher's acquisition strategy means you will inevitably inherit teams from acquired companies — managing cultural integration alongside technical integration is a skill ICE pays a premium for.

#### Physical AI — The Infrastructure Sovereign Premium

- **Mortgage Digitization ($12T Market):** Engineering Managers overseeing ICE Mortgage Technology teams manage the digitization of the $12 trillion US mortgage market. Your team processes over 50% of US mortgage applications — your management decisions directly affect whether American families can close on their homes. Negotiate an Infrastructure Sovereign management bonus of $30K-$50K annually: "My team owns the digital pipeline for the largest asset class in America. The management premium should reflect the systemic impact of this responsibility."

- **Energy-Data Center Convergence:** Managers leading teams at the intersection of ICE's energy trading platforms and data infrastructure are uniquely positioned for the Physical AI premium. As AI data centers consume increasing amounts of energy, ICE's energy markets become critical pricing infrastructure for the AI economy. Negotiate a convergence management premium of $20K-$35K: "I manage the team that connects ICE's energy price discovery to the infrastructure demands of AI compute — the management complexity of bridging physical and digital domains commands a premium."

- **Infrastructure Sovereign Bonus Structure:** Engineering Managers qualify for Infrastructure Sovereign bonuses of $30K-$55K annually, tied to team outcomes that bridge physical and digital infrastructure. This includes team-level metrics on exchange uptime, mortgage processing throughput, clearing system reliability, or energy data feed accuracy. Frame your management as "leading the team that controls the physical-digital bridge" to qualify at the highest bonus tier.

- **Acquisition Team Integration Premium:** Every ICE acquisition brings new engineering teams that must be culturally and technically integrated. Engineering Managers who successfully merge acquired teams into ICE's engineering culture earn integration management premiums of $20K-$35K per acquisition cycle. Position this during negotiation: "I have experience integrating engineering teams from acquired companies — this directly supports ICE's growth-by-acquisition strategy and deserves specific compensation."

#### Global Levers

1. **Team Size and Scope Multiplier:** Engineering Manager compensation at ICE scales with team size and business-unit scope. Negotiate based on headcount: *"I'll be managing a team of 12-15 engineers across two critical systems — exchange connectivity and clearing infrastructure. At this scope, I'd like to discuss compensation at $380K total comp, reflecting the M2 band rather than M1."* Target: $370K-$392K TC.

2. **Regulatory Burden Premium:** ICE operates under SEC, CFTC, FCA, and multiple global regulatory frameworks. Your team must maintain compliance across all of them. Use this: *"My team operates under multi-jurisdictional regulatory oversight — SEC, CFTC, and FCA simultaneously. The management complexity of maintaining engineering velocity while ensuring regulatory compliance across three continents deserves a $25K-$35K regulatory management premium."* Target: $25K-$35K added to bonus.

3. **On-Call and Incident Management:** Financial infrastructure requires 24/7 management availability. Negotiate explicitly for this: *"As Engineering Manager for market infrastructure, I'm effectively on-call during all market hours across global time zones — US, European, and Asian sessions. I'd like to discuss either a $20K on-call premium or additional RSU compensation of $60K/4yr to reflect this availability requirement."* Target: $20K annual premium or $60K additional RSUs.

4. **Hiring Authority Leverage:** Engineering Managers at ICE often have significant hiring authority. Frame this as additional responsibility: *"I'll be responsible for growing the team from 8 to 15 engineers over the next 18 months — effectively building a second team. I'd like my compensation to reflect this growth mandate at $375K total comp with a commitment to re-evaluate at the 12-month mark when the team reaches target headcount."* Target: Built-in compensation review trigger.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $385K total comp for Atlanta and $430K for New York. Open with: *"As an Engineering Manager leading teams that own ICE's physical-digital bridge infrastructure, I'm targeting $385K total comp in Atlanta, inclusive of the Infrastructure Sovereign management premium."* If countered at $310K, respond: *"To bridge the gap, I'd propose: $215K base (from $195K), Infrastructure Sovereign management bonus at $40K target, RSU grant of $340K/4yr (from $280K), and a $45K signing bonus. This reaches $370K total comp — appropriate for the M2 scope of this role."* Walk-away floor: $285K Atlanta, $320K New York, £230K London. Signing bonus target: $35K-$55K. Final counter: *"If base is firm at $200K, I'll accept with an RSU increase to $360K/4yr, a $50K signing bonus, written Infrastructure Sovereign bonus eligibility at $45K target, and a 12-month compensation review tied to team growth milestones."*
