#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at Fidelity Investments orchestrate the delivery of programs that span Fidelity's 15,000+ engineer organization and touch $4.9 trillion in managed assets. You are the connective tissue between engineering teams, product organizations, compliance departments, and executive leadership — ensuring that Fidelity's most critical technical initiatives ship on time, on budget, and in compliance with federal regulations. With a $12 billion annual technology budget funding hundreds of concurrent programs, TPMs at Fidelity manage complexity at a scale that few organizations in the world can match.

The FIDD (Fidelity Institutional Digital Dollar) stablecoin launch is the defining TPM challenge of 2026. The GENIUS Act imposes hard regulatory deadlines for stablecoin compliance — reserve systems, consumer protection frameworks, and reporting infrastructure must be production-ready before FIDD can launch. A TPM who can coordinate the cross-functional delivery of a regulated stablecoin product — aligning engineering, legal, compliance, and business teams around federal deadlines — is worth exponentially more than a TPM managing routine feature releases. The Stability Premium for TPMs with regulated program delivery experience ranges from $18K-$35K above standard offers.

Position yourself as the person who guarantees FIDD ships on the regulatory timeline. CEO Abigail Johnson's crypto-forward strategy depends on execution, and execution at this scale depends on TPMs. Every day of delay in FIDD's launch costs Fidelity market share in the $150B+ stablecoin market. Your ability to de-risk the launch timeline, coordinate across 50+ stakeholders, and navigate regulatory complexity is your primary negotiation lever.

#### Regulatory Resilience — The FIDD Stability Premium

- **GENIUS Act Regulatory Deadline Management:** The GENIUS Act creates hard compliance deadlines for stablecoin issuers — these are not negotiable launch dates driven by business strategy but federal regulatory requirements with legal consequences. TPMs who can build program plans around regulatory milestones, manage compliance dependencies, and coordinate with federal regulators and internal legal teams command a Stability Premium of $18K-$30K above standard offers. Target $230K-$265K total compensation (Boston) if you bring experience managing programs with regulatory deadlines.

- **FIDD Cross-Functional Program Delivery:** The FIDD launch requires coordinating across engineering (infrastructure, smart contracts, API development), compliance (GENIUS Act requirements, SEC coordination), legal (stablecoin licensing, consumer protection), and business (institutional client onboarding, marketing). TPMs must build and maintain program plans that align all of these stakeholders around a shared timeline. Negotiate a $15K-$25K premium by demonstrating your track record of delivering cross-functional programs involving regulatory stakeholders.

- **$12B Tech Moat — Program Scale:** Fidelity's $12 billion technology budget means TPMs manage programs with budgets and team sizes that rival major tech companies. The FIDD program alone may involve 50-100+ engineers, dozens of compliance specialists, and multiple executive stakeholders. Use this scale in negotiation: *"Managing a program of this complexity — coordinating 50+ engineers, compliance teams, and federal regulators within Fidelity's $12B technology organization — requires senior program management expertise. My compensation should reflect the scale and regulatory stakes of the FIDD launch."*

- **Stability Premium Dollar Amounts:** TPMs managing FIDD-related programs should target: base salary uplift of $15K-$22K (targeting $155K-$175K base in Boston), Profit-Based RSU enhancement of $8K-$12K annually, delivery milestone bonus of $10K-$20K tied to FIDD launch milestones, and a signing bonus of $20K-$35K. Total first-year Stability Premium: $53K-$89K. These premiums reflect the outsized impact of program execution on FIDD's regulatory timeline and market launch.

#### Global Levers

1. **Delivery Milestone Bonus:** Tie bonus compensation to FIDD launch milestones. Script: *"I'd like to discuss a milestone bonus structure tied to FIDD delivery: $5K upon completing the compliance architecture review, $8K upon passing the federal reserve attestation audit, and $12K upon production launch. This aligns my incentives directly with the regulatory timeline."*

2. **Profit-Based RSU Enhancement:** Script: *"My program management directly determines whether FIDD launches on time — and every month of delay costs Fidelity market share in the $150B stablecoin market. I'd like an RSU allocation that reflects this impact: $38K-$45K annually."*

3. **Scope and Title Guarantee:** Script: *"I'd like the offer to explicitly state that I'll serve as the lead TPM for the FIDD stablecoin launch program, with direct reporting to the VP of Engineering and regular engagement with the Chief Compliance Officer. This scope justification supports the compensation level we've discussed."*

4. **Signing Bonus for Immediate Availability:** Script: *"To start immediately on the FIDD program — which I understand has an aggressive regulatory timeline — I'll need to leave my current position before my next equity vest. A signing bonus of $25K-$35K would offset this forfeited equity and enable me to start within two weeks."*

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $238K total compensation (Boston), positioning yourself at the 65th percentile. Your counter-offer script: *"I'm uniquely qualified to lead the FIDD stablecoin program — my experience managing [regulated product launches/cross-functional programs with compliance dependencies] directly applies to the GENIUS Act timeline and Fidelity's institutional launch strategy. I'm targeting $238K total compensation: $162K base, $40K in Profit-Based RSUs, and $36K bonus, plus a $28K signing bonus and a delivery milestone bonus of up to $25K tied to FIDD launch milestones."* Walk-away floors: Boston $185K TC, Durham $167K TC, Dallas $170K TC. If base is constrained, push for milestone bonuses and RSU enhancements — TPMs have strong leverage here because their impact on launch timelines is directly measurable.
