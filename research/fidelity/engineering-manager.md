#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at Fidelity Investments lead teams that build and maintain systems powering $4.9 trillion in managed assets and 46 million individual investor accounts. Unlike pure-play tech companies where engineering management is often separated from business impact, Fidelity EMs operate at the intersection of technology delivery and financial services regulation. Your team's output directly affects Fidelity's competitive position against Schwab, Vanguard, and an emerging class of crypto-native financial platforms. With a $12 billion annual technology budget, Fidelity's engineering management chain oversees one of the largest private technology organizations in the world.

The 2026 FIDD (Fidelity Institutional Digital Dollar) stablecoin launch creates an extraordinary opportunity for Engineering Managers. The GENIUS Act's regulatory requirements demand not just technical excellence but organizational discipline — compliance milestones, audit readiness, cross-functional coordination with legal and regulatory teams, and the ability to scale engineering teams rapidly while maintaining quality. EMs who can lead FIDD-related teams — stablecoin infrastructure, compliance automation, digital custody systems — command Stability Premiums of $25K-$45K above standard management offers.

Position yourself as the leader who can both build high-performing teams and navigate the regulatory complexity that defines Fidelity's digital asset strategy. CEO Abigail Johnson's crypto-forward vision requires managers who understand that shipping compliant code to a federal deadline is fundamentally different from shipping a consumer feature on a flexible timeline. Your experience managing regulated engineering teams, leading compliance-adjacent projects, or scaling teams under pressure is your primary negotiation lever.

#### Regulatory Resilience — The FIDD Stability Premium

- **GENIUS Act Compliance Delivery:** The GENIUS Act imposes hard regulatory deadlines for stablecoin issuers — reserve attestation systems, consumer protection frameworks, and real-time reporting infrastructure must be production-ready before FIDD can launch. Engineering Managers who can lead teams to deliver compliant systems on regulatory timelines are critically scarce. This delivery capability commands a Stability Premium of $25K-$40K above standard EM offers. Negotiate for $310K-$372K total compensation (Boston) by demonstrating your track record of delivering regulated or compliance-critical systems on time.

- **FIDD Team Building and Scaling:** The FIDD stablecoin initiative requires Fidelity to rapidly scale engineering teams — from initial architecture teams of 8-12 engineers to production-scale organizations of 30-50+. Engineering Managers who can hire, onboard, and ramp engineers quickly while maintaining code quality and regulatory compliance are the bottleneck. Negotiate a $15K-$25K premium on base salary by framing your hiring track record: *"In my previous role, I scaled my team from 6 to 22 engineers in 9 months while shipping on schedule. I can replicate this for the FIDD initiative."*

- **$12B Tech Moat — Management at Scale:** Fidelity's $12 billion technology budget means Engineering Managers oversee teams with best-in-class tooling, infrastructure, and support. But it also means managing within a large, complex organization with multiple stakeholders. Use this complexity as leverage: *"Managing engineering teams within a $12B technology organization requires a different caliber of leadership than managing a 5-person startup team. My experience leading cross-functional teams at scale directly supports the organizational complexity of the FIDD launch."*

- **Stability Premium Dollar Amounts:** Engineering Managers leading FIDD-adjacent teams should target: base salary of $210K-$238K (Boston), Profit-Based RSU allocation of $50K-$65K annually, performance bonus target of 25-30% (vs. standard 20-22%), and a signing bonus of $35K-$55K. Total first-year Stability Premium: $75K-$130K above standard Engineering Manager offers at Fidelity. These premiums are justified by the regulatory urgency of the FIDD launch and the scarcity of EMs with regulated infrastructure delivery experience.

#### Global Levers

1. **Management Bonus Target Uplift:** Fidelity's bonus structure for managers is typically 20-25% of base. Negotiate for a higher target tied to FIDD delivery milestones. Script: *"Given the critical nature of the FIDD launch and the regulatory deadlines involved, I'd like to discuss a bonus target of 28-30% of base, with 50% tied to FIDD delivery milestones and 50% tied to team performance metrics. This aligns my incentives directly with Fidelity's strategic priorities."*

2. **Headcount Guarantee:** Your team size directly impacts your scope and future compensation trajectory. Negotiate for guaranteed headcount. Script: *"To deliver the FIDD compliance infrastructure on timeline, I'll need a team of at least 12 engineers within the first 6 months. I'd like the offer to include a headcount commitment of 12 FTEs, with authorization to hire 4 additional engineers in Q3 based on delivery progress."*

3. **Dual-Ladder Flexibility:** Fidelity supports both management and IC tracks. Negotiate for the option to move between tracks without compensation loss. Script: *"As the FIDD initiative matures, I want to ensure I have the flexibility to shift between management and principal engineering roles without a compensation reset. Can we document this dual-ladder eligibility in my offer?"*

4. **Leadership Development Budget:** Fidelity invests heavily in leadership development. Negotiate for a dedicated budget. Script: *"I'd like to include a $15K annual leadership development budget for executive coaching, conference attendance, and management training. This investment in my growth directly benefits Fidelity by ensuring I can lead increasingly complex teams as the FIDD initiative scales."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $340K total compensation (Boston), which sits at the 70th percentile and signals that you expect top-of-band treatment. Your counter-offer script: *"I'm excited about leading the FIDD engineering team and the opportunity to build regulated digital infrastructure at Fidelity's scale. I'm targeting $340K total compensation: $220K base, $58K in Profit-Based RSUs, and $62K bonus target, plus a $45K signing bonus and guaranteed headcount of 12 engineers. I have competing offers from [JPMorgan/Coinbase/Amazon] that exceed $350K, but Fidelity's FIDD opportunity is uniquely compelling."* Walk-away floors: Boston $258K TC, Durham $232K TC, Dallas $238K TC. If base is constrained by band limits, push for an accelerated promotion review at 12 months to Senior Engineering Manager (Band 8) with a guaranteed $30K+ compensation increase.
