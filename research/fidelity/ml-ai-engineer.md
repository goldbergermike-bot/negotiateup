#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at Fidelity Investments build the intelligent systems that power one of the world's largest financial services platforms. With $4.9 trillion in assets under management and 46 million investor accounts, Fidelity generates training data at a scale that most AI companies can only imagine — billions of transactions, decades of market history, millions of portfolio optimization events, and comprehensive behavioral data from one of the largest retail investor bases in the world. Your models do not just predict; they make decisions that directly affect how trillions of dollars are managed, invested, and protected.

The 2026 FIDD (Fidelity Institutional Digital Dollar) stablecoin launch creates an AI/ML frontier that did not exist 18 months ago. The GENIUS Act's compliance requirements demand intelligent systems for real-time anomaly detection, automated compliance monitoring, reserve optimization modeling, and predictive risk assessment. ML/AI Engineers who can build these regulated intelligent systems — models that not only perform well but are explainable, auditable, and compliant with federal standards — represent the highest-demand engineering specialty in financial services. The Stability Premium for ML/AI Engineers with this combination of skills ranges from $30K-$55K above standard offers.

Your negotiation position is exceptionally strong. ML/AI Engineers are among the most competitive talent categories globally, with FAANG companies, hedge funds, and AI labs all competing for the same candidates. Fidelity's $12B tech budget positions it to compete at these levels, and its unique combination of massive proprietary data, institutional scale, and a crypto-forward strategy creates a differentiated value proposition that pure-play tech or crypto companies cannot match. Use competing offers aggressively — Fidelity's recruiters are authorized to match or exceed FAANG and quant fund compensation for ML/AI talent.

#### Regulatory Resilience — The FIDD Stability Premium

- **GENIUS Act Compliance AI:** The GENIUS Act requires stablecoin issuers to implement ongoing monitoring of reserve adequacy, suspicious transaction detection, and consumer protection mechanisms. ML/AI Engineers will build the intelligent systems that automate these compliance requirements — anomaly detection models for identifying suspicious stablecoin transactions, predictive models for reserve adequacy under stress scenarios, and NLP systems for automated regulatory report generation. Engineers with experience building compliant, auditable ML systems can negotiate a Stability Premium of $30K-$45K above standard offers. Target $330K-$375K total compensation (Boston).

- **FIDD Predictive Risk and Stability Modeling:** The FIDD stablecoin must maintain its dollar peg under extreme market conditions. ML/AI Engineers will build predictive models that forecast redemption surges, detect market manipulation attempts, optimize reserve allocation strategies, and trigger automated stability mechanisms before depegging events occur. These models must be both highly accurate and fully explainable — federal regulators will demand to understand why an automated system triggered a specific action. Negotiate for a $25K-$40K model complexity premium by demonstrating experience with explainable AI, regulatory-grade model validation, or financial risk modeling.

- **$12B Tech Moat — AI Compute and Data Advantage:** Fidelity's $12 billion technology budget funds GPU clusters, proprietary training data (decades of market and transaction history), and dedicated ML infrastructure that enable model development at a scale that rivals OpenAI and Google DeepMind for financial applications. This computational advantage is your leverage: *"Fidelity's $12B tech investment gives me access to training data and compute that would cost millions at a startup. I want my compensation to reflect the ML talent that this infrastructure is designed to attract — I'm targeting the 80th percentile."*

- **Stability Premium Dollar Amounts:** ML/AI Engineers working on FIDD-related intelligent systems should target: base salary uplift of $22K-$38K (targeting $210K-$245K base in Boston), Profit-Based RSU enhancement of $12K-$22K annually, model performance bonus of $10K-$20K tied to model accuracy and regulatory audit outcomes, and a signing bonus of $35K-$55K. Total first-year Stability Premium: $79K-$135K. These premiums reflect the extreme scarcity of ML/AI engineers who can build compliant, explainable, production-grade intelligent systems for regulated financial infrastructure.

#### Global Levers

1. **Research Publication and Conference Budget:** ML/AI Engineers value the ability to publish and present. Script: *"I'd like to include a $15K annual research and conference budget covering NeurIPS, ICML, KDD, and AI in Finance conferences. Publishing Fidelity's ML research enhances the firm's recruiting brand and positions Fidelity as a leader in applied financial AI."*

2. **Profit-Based RSU Maximization to Quant Fund Parity:** Script: *"Quantitative hedge funds (Two Sigma, Citadel, Renaissance) offer ML engineers total compensation packages of $400K-$700K. While Fidelity's mission is different, I'd like to discuss an RSU allocation that approaches competitive parity — $55K-$65K annually — given the strategic importance of AI/ML to the FIDD initiative."*

3. **GPU Compute Budget:** Negotiate for a dedicated compute budget. Script: *"I'd like a dedicated GPU compute allocation equivalent to $50K-$80K annually in cloud compute credits for FIDD model development. This ensures I can iterate quickly on the compliance AI and risk modeling systems without competing for shared resources."*

4. **Signing Bonus for Equity Bridge:** Script: *"I'll be forfeiting approximately $120K in unvested equity and stock options by leaving my current position. A signing bonus of $45K-$55K, plus an accelerated Profit-Based RSU vesting schedule, would bridge this gap and demonstrate Fidelity's commitment to competing for top ML talent."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $345K total compensation (Boston), which positions you at the 75th percentile and signals that you expect premium treatment. Your counter-offer script: *"I'm deeply excited about building the AI/ML systems for FIDD — compliance AI, predictive risk models, and real-time anomaly detection at institutional scale. Based on my ML engineering experience, competing offers from [Google/Meta/Two Sigma/OpenAI], and the strategic importance of AI to FIDD's success, I'm targeting $345K total compensation: $228K base, $60K in Profit-Based RSUs, and $57K bonus, plus a $50K signing bonus. I believe this reflects both the market for ML/AI talent and the unique impact of building regulated AI systems for a $4.9T asset manager."* Walk-away floors: Boston $255K TC, Durham $229K TC, Dallas $235K TC. If base is constrained, push hard on RSU enhancement and signing bonus — Fidelity has significant flexibility in these areas for ML/AI talent, and recruiters know they are competing with $500K+ offers from quant funds.
