**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity Technical Program Managers coordinate the complex cross-functional execution required to deliver the combined PingOne + ForgeRock identity platform — managing the programs that merge two identity engineering organizations, integrate two technology stacks, and ship unified features to enterprises managing 100M+ CIAM users. You drive the program cadence across engineering, product, design, and operations teams, manage the merger integration milestones, and ensure delivery timelines align with competitive market windows against Okta and Microsoft Entra ID. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, comp is base-heavy with meaningful bonus targets and phantom equity participation units. Your program execution directly determines the speed at which the combined platform reaches market. [Source: Ping Identity TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity TPM (TPM2-TPM3) = Okta TPM = CyberArk TPM = SailPoint TPM = ForgeRock TPM = Microsoft Identity TPM (L62-L63)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity TPM now coordinates programs across the combined platform managing 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity deployments on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your program management spans two engineering organizations, two technology stacks, and two deployment models simultaneously — a dual-organization coordination challenge no other identity company presents at this scale. "As a Technical Program Manager coordinating delivery across the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I manage the programs that unify two identity organizations to serve 100M+ CIAM users. TPMs who can coordinate merger integration programs across dual-stack identity teams command a Complexity Premium — this is the hardest identity program management in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **Merger Integration Program Management:** "I manage the programs that integrate two complete identity engineering organizations — coordinating the merger of PingOne and ForgeRock teams, technology stacks, and delivery processes. Merger integration program management is the most complex coordination challenge in identity."
2. **Cross-Stack Delivery Coordination:** "I coordinate delivery across both PingOne cloud-native and ForgeRock on-prem engineering teams — managing dependencies between two technology architectures shipping unified features. Dual-stack program coordination requires expertise in both identity platforms."
3. **CIAM Release Management:** "I manage release programs for identity features serving 100M+ consumer users — coordinating the zero-downtime deployments, backward compatibility testing, and enterprise upgrade paths that CIAM-scale identity demands."
4. **Competitive Timing Execution:** "My program execution determines whether Ping Identity ships competitive features before Okta and Microsoft Entra ID. TPMs whose delivery coordination directly impacts competitive timing and market share command premium comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $195K base and $75K phantom equity over 4 years with a 15% bonus target for this Technical Program Manager role. I coordinate the merger integration programs that unify PingOne and ForgeRock into a single platform serving 100M+ CIAM users — the most complex program management challenge in identity. I have competing offers from [Okta TPM at $262K TC / Microsoft Identity TPM at $272K TC / SailPoint TPM at $248K TC]. TPMs who can manage dual-organization merger integration while maintaining CIAM delivery velocity are the coordination bottleneck." Accept at $175K+ base and $58K+ phantom equity.
