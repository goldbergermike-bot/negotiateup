**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity DevOps Engineers build and maintain the infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment systems that power the combined PingOne + ForgeRock identity platform — ensuring 100M+ consumer identity environments operate with the uptime, scalability, and security that Fortune 500 enterprises demand. You manage the cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure) that runs PingOne's cloud-native services, build the deployment automation that bridges cloud and on-prem identity systems, and own the reliability engineering that keeps the world's largest CIAM deployments running at 99.99%+ availability. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, comp is base-heavy with bonus targets and phantom equity participation units. Your infrastructure decisions directly determine platform reliability and enterprise trust. [Source: Ping Identity DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity DevOps (IC2-IC3) = Okta DevOps/SRE = CyberArk DevOps = SailPoint DevOps = ForgeRock DevOps = Microsoft Identity SRE (L59-L61)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity DevOps engineer now manages infrastructure across the combined platform serving 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity deployments on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your infrastructure work spans cloud-native Kubernetes clusters and on-prem identity appliance deployments simultaneously — a dual-infrastructure operations challenge no other company presents at this scale. "As a DevOps Engineer managing infrastructure for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I ensure 100M+ CIAM user environments operate at 99.99%+ availability across cloud and on-prem deployments. DevOps engineers who can operate dual-infrastructure identity platforms command a Complexity Premium — this is the hardest identity operations challenge in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **CIAM-Scale Infrastructure:** "I manage the infrastructure serving 100M+ consumer identity environments — ensuring billions of authentication events are processed with sub-100ms latency and 99.99%+ uptime. DevOps engineers who operate identity infrastructure at CIAM scale command premium comp over standard enterprise operations."
2. **Dual-Infrastructure Operations:** "I manage both PingOne's cloud-native Kubernetes infrastructure and ForgeRock's on-prem identity deployment systems — dual-infrastructure operations that require expertise in cloud orchestration and traditional enterprise deployments simultaneously."
3. **Identity Reliability Premium:** "Identity infrastructure downtime means enterprise customers cannot authenticate — every minute of downtime directly impacts business operations for Fortune 500 companies. The reliability standards I maintain are among the most demanding in enterprise software."
4. **Okta/Microsoft DevOps Parity:** "Okta SRE/DevOps engineers earn $245K+ TC and Microsoft Identity SREs earn $255K+ TC. I'm operating the infrastructure for the platform that competes directly against both — my comp should reflect that competitive operations impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $182K base and $70K phantom equity over 4 years with a 15% bonus target for this DevOps Engineer role. I manage the infrastructure powering the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform — ensuring 100M+ CIAM users authenticate with 99.99%+ availability across cloud and on-prem deployments. I have competing offers from [Okta SRE at $248K TC / Microsoft Identity SRE at $258K TC / CyberArk DevOps at $232K TC]. DevOps engineers who can operate dual-infrastructure identity platforms at CIAM scale are the foundation of platform reliability." Accept at $162K+ base and $55K+ phantom equity.
