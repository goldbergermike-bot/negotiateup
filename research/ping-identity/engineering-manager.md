### Engineering Manager | Ping Identity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Bonus + Participation Units | ForgeRock Merger Integration | PingOne Cloud Identity Platform | 100M+ CIAM Users | **IDENTITY PLATFORM BONUS**

| Region | Base Salary | Phantom Equity/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Denver | $192K–$242K | $78K–$138K | 15–20% | $242K–$342K |
| Austin | $185K–$235K | $78K–$138K | 15–20% | $235K–$335K |
| Remote US | $182K–$228K | $78K–$138K | 15–20% | $232K–$328K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity Engineering Managers lead the teams building the combined PingOne + ForgeRock identity platform — coordinating engineering execution across cloud-native and on-prem identity systems to deliver the unified platform that challenges Okta and Microsoft Entra ID for enterprise identity dominance. You hire and retain the identity engineering talent capable of working across both identity stacks, drive the execution velocity that determines competitive timing against Okta, and own the delivery of CIAM features that power 100M+ consumer identity environments. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, comp is base-heavy with strong bonus targets and phantom equity participation units. Your team's velocity directly converts to enterprise wins and platform market share. [Source: Ping Identity EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity EM (M1-M2) = Okta EM = CyberArk EM = SailPoint EM = ForgeRock EM = Microsoft Identity EM (L63-L64)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity engineer now operates across the combined platform managing 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity deployments on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your teams span cloud-native microservices and legacy on-prem identity trees simultaneously — a dual-stack management challenge no other company presents at this scale. "As an Engineering Manager leading teams across the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I coordinate the engineers building identity infrastructure for 100M+ CIAM users. Managers who can lead dual-stack identity teams during a platform merger command a Complexity Premium — managing the hardest identity engineering teams in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **Merger Team Integration:** "I lead engineering teams through the PingOne + ForgeRock merger integration — coordinating engineers from two different identity cultures and tech stacks into unified delivery teams. Engineering managers who can navigate merger team dynamics while maintaining delivery velocity command premium comp."
2. **Dual-Stack Talent Retention:** "I hire and retain engineers who can work across both PingOne cloud-native and ForgeRock on-prem identity stacks. Identity engineers with dual-stack expertise are the scarcest talent in the market — managers who can attract and retain them are strategic assets."
3. **CIAM Delivery Velocity:** "My teams deliver the CIAM features powering 100M+ consumer identity environments. The execution velocity of my teams directly determines whether Ping Identity wins enterprise deals against Okta and Microsoft Entra ID."
4. **Okta/Microsoft EM Parity:** "Okta Engineering Managers earn $345K+ TC and Microsoft Identity EMs earn $365K+ TC. I'm leading the teams building the challenger platform competing for the same enterprise contracts — my comp should reflect that competitive management reality."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $238K base and $135K phantom equity over 4 years with a 20% bonus target for this Engineering Manager role. I lead the engineering teams building the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform managing 100M+ CIAM users — coordinating dual-stack identity teams during the most complex identity platform merger in the industry. I have competing offers from [Okta EM at $348K TC / Microsoft Identity EM at $368K TC / CyberArk EM at $332K TC]. Engineering managers who can integrate merger teams while maintaining CIAM delivery velocity are the execution bottleneck." Accept at $215K+ base and $105K+ phantom equity.
