**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity Software Engineers build the foundational identity infrastructure powering the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform — the unified cloud and on-prem identity system that competes directly against Okta and Microsoft Entra ID for enterprise and consumer identity dominance. You write the authentication flows, authorization engines, and identity orchestration code that protects 100M+ consumer identities across the world's largest CIAM deployments. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, comp is base-heavy with meaningful bonus targets and phantom equity participation units that vest over four years, giving you upside exposure to the combined platform's valuation growth without public market volatility. Your code directly powers the identity platform challenging the Okta/Microsoft duopoly. [Source: Ping Identity SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity SWE (IC2-IC3) = Okta SWE = CyberArk SWE = SailPoint SWE = ForgeRock SWE = Microsoft Identity SWE (L59-L61)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity engineer now operates across the combined platform managing 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity deployments on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your work spans cloud-native microservices and legacy on-prem identity trees simultaneously — a dual-stack identity engineering challenge no other company presents at this scale. "As a Software Engineer on the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I build identity infrastructure managing 100M+ CIAM users across cloud and on-prem environments. Engineers who can work across both identity stacks command a Complexity Premium — this is the hardest identity engineering in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **CIAM Scale Premium:** "I build authentication and authorization infrastructure for 100M+ consumer identity environments. Engineers building identity at this CIAM scale — handling billions of authentication events across the world's largest consumer deployments — command premium comp over standard enterprise identity work."
2. **ForgeRock Integration Expertise:** "I work across both the PingOne cloud platform and ForgeRock's on-prem identity stack — dual-stack identity engineering that requires understanding two complete identity architectures. This combined platform complexity is unique in the identity market."
3. **Okta/Microsoft Competitive Threat:** "Okta and Microsoft Entra ID are the primary competitors, and Ping Identity needs top engineering talent to win enterprise deals. Okta SWEs at IC2-IC3 earn $245K+ TC — Ping Identity engineers building the challenger platform deserve competitive comp."
4. **Thoma Bravo Upside + Base Security:** "As a private company, I want strong base compensation reflecting the reduced liquidity of phantom equity. My participation units should reflect the combined platform's valuation trajectory post-merger — this is a pre-IPO opportunity in the identity space."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $185K base and $72K phantom equity over 4 years with a 15% bonus target for this Software Engineer role. I build the PingOne + ForgeRock combined identity platform managing 100M+ CIAM users — the most complex identity engineering in the market. I have competing offers from [Okta SWE at $248K TC / CyberArk SWE at $235K TC / Microsoft Identity at $252K TC]. Engineers building the challenger platform to the Okta/Microsoft duopoly in the largest CIAM environments command premium comp." Accept at $168K+ base and $58K+ phantom equity.
