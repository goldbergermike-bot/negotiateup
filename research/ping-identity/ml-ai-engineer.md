### ML/AI Engineer | Ping Identity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Bonus + Participation Units | ForgeRock Merger Integration | PingOne Cloud Identity Platform | 100M+ CIAM Users | **AI PREMIUM + IDENTITY INTELLIGENCE BONUS**

| Region | Base Salary | Phantom Equity/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Denver | $182K–$228K | $68K–$122K | 15–20% | $228K–$322K |
| Austin | $175K–$222K | $68K–$122K | 15–20% | $222K–$315K |
| Remote US | $172K–$215K | $68K–$122K | 15–20% | $218K–$308K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity ML/AI Engineers build the machine learning models and AI systems that power intelligent identity — developing adaptive authentication, behavioral biometrics, identity threat detection, and AI-driven access governance across the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform serving 100M+ CIAM users. You train models on the richest identity dataset in the enterprise market, build real-time inference systems that make authentication decisions in milliseconds, and develop the AI capabilities that differentiate Ping Identity from Okta and Microsoft Entra ID. The +10-20% AI Premium reflects the extraordinary market demand for ML engineers who can apply AI to identity security. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, comp is base-heavy with strong bonus targets and phantom equity participation units. Your AI systems directly power the next generation of identity intelligence.

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity ML/AI (IC3-IC4) = Okta ML Engineer = CyberArk ML Engineer = SailPoint ML Engineer = ForgeRock ML Engineer = Microsoft Identity ML (L62-L64)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity ML/AI engineer now builds intelligent systems across the combined platform analyzing 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity datasets on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your models must learn from identity signals across both cloud-native and on-prem systems simultaneously — a dual-source ML challenge that produces the most sophisticated identity intelligence in the market. "As an ML/AI Engineer building intelligent identity systems for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I train models on 100M+ CIAM user behavioral data from dual-source identity environments. ML engineers who can build AI-powered identity intelligence across both stacks command both the AI Premium and the Complexity Premium — this is the frontier of identity AI."

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Premium + Identity Intelligence:** "I build the AI systems that power adaptive authentication, behavioral biometrics, and identity threat detection for 100M+ CIAM users. The +10-20% AI Premium reflects the extraordinary market demand for ML engineers — combined with identity domain expertise, this is the most valuable skill intersection in the identity market."
2. **CIAM-Scale Model Training:** "I train models on the richest identity dataset in enterprise software — billions of authentication events, behavioral patterns, and identity signals from 100M+ consumer users across the combined platform. ML engineers with access to identity data at this scale build the most sophisticated identity AI in the market."
3. **Dual-Source Identity ML:** "I build models that learn from identity signals across PingOne cloud-native events and ForgeRock on-prem identity data — dual-source ML that requires understanding both identity architectures. This cross-platform model training produces identity intelligence no single-stack platform can match."
4. **Okta/Microsoft AI Parity:** "Okta ML Engineers earn $325K+ TC and Microsoft Identity ML Engineers earn $345K+ TC. I'm building the AI-powered identity intelligence that competes directly against both platforms — my comp should reflect both the AI Premium and the identity Complexity Premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $118K phantom equity over 4 years with a 20% bonus target for this ML/AI Engineer role. I build the AI-powered identity intelligence for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform — training models on 100M+ CIAM user data to power adaptive authentication and identity threat detection. I have competing offers from [Okta ML at $328K TC / Microsoft Identity ML at $348K TC / CyberArk ML at $312K TC]. ML engineers who can build identity AI across dual-source platforms with the AI Premium are the scarcest and most valuable talent in identity." Accept at $202K+ base and $92K+ phantom equity.
