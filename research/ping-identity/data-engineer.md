### Data Engineer | Ping Identity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Bonus + Participation Units | ForgeRock Merger Integration | PingOne Cloud Identity Platform | 100M+ CIAM Users | **IDENTITY DATA BONUS**

| Region | Base Salary | Phantom Equity/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Denver | $152K–$192K | $42K–$75K | 10–15% | $178K–$248K |
| Austin | $148K–$185K | $42K–$75K | 10–15% | $175K–$242K |
| Remote US | $142K–$182K | $42K–$75K | 10–15% | $168K–$235K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity Data Engineers build and maintain the data pipelines, identity data lakes, and analytics infrastructure that power the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform — processing billions of authentication events, identity lifecycle changes, and access management signals across 100M+ CIAM user environments. You design the data architectures that unify identity data from cloud-native and on-prem sources, build real-time streaming pipelines for authentication analytics, and maintain the data infrastructure that enables identity intelligence, fraud detection, and compliance reporting for the world's largest enterprises. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, comp is base-heavy with bonus targets and phantom equity participation units. Your data pipelines directly power the identity intelligence that differentiates the platform. [Source: Ping Identity DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity DE (IC2-IC3) = Okta DE = CyberArk DE = SailPoint DE = ForgeRock DE = Microsoft Identity DE (L59-L61)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity data engineer now builds pipelines across the combined platform processing data from 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity data volumes on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your data engineering spans cloud-native event streams and on-prem identity logs simultaneously — a dual-source data integration challenge that produces the richest identity data corpus in the market. "As a Data Engineer building pipelines for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I process identity data from 100M+ CIAM user environments — billions of authentication events from dual-source cloud and on-prem systems. Data engineers who can build unified identity data architectures across both stacks command a Complexity Premium — this is the hardest identity data engineering in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **CIAM-Scale Data Processing:** "I build data pipelines processing billions of authentication events, identity lifecycle changes, and access signals across 100M+ consumer identity environments. Data engineers who operate at CIAM data volumes — petabytes of identity signals — command premium comp over standard enterprise data engineering."
2. **Dual-Source Data Unification:** "I unify identity data from PingOne cloud-native event streams and ForgeRock on-prem identity logs into a coherent data architecture — building the unified identity data lake that powers analytics, compliance, and intelligence across both platforms."
3. **Real-Time Identity Streaming:** "I build real-time streaming pipelines that process authentication events with sub-second latency — enabling real-time fraud detection, identity risk scoring, and compliance monitoring at CIAM scale. Real-time identity data engineering is among the most demanding streaming challenges."
4. **Okta/Microsoft DE Parity:** "Okta Data Engineers earn $252K+ TC and Microsoft Identity Data Engineers earn $258K+ TC. I'm building the identity data infrastructure that competes directly against both platforms — my comp should reflect that competitive data engineering impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $188K base and $72K phantom equity over 4 years with a 15% bonus target for this Data Engineer role. I build the identity data pipelines for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform — processing billions of authentication events from 100M+ CIAM user environments across dual-source cloud and on-prem systems. I have competing offers from [Okta DE at $255K TC / Microsoft Identity DE at $262K TC / SailPoint DE at $242K TC]. Data engineers who can unify dual-source identity data architectures at CIAM scale are the foundation of platform intelligence." Accept at $168K+ base and $55K+ phantom equity.
