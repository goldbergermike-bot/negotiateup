### Product Manager | Ping Identity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Bonus + Participation Units | ForgeRock Merger Integration | PingOne Cloud Identity Platform | 100M+ CIAM Users | **IDENTITY PLATFORM BONUS**

| Region | Base Salary | Phantom Equity/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Denver | $165K–$208K | $55K–$98K | 10–15% | $202K–$282K |
| Austin | $158K–$202K | $55K–$98K | 10–15% | $195K–$275K |
| Remote US | $155K–$195K | $55K–$98K | 10–15% | $192K–$268K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity Product Managers define the product vision and roadmap for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock identity platform — determining which identity capabilities ship, how cloud-native and on-prem features converge, and which CIAM innovations win enterprise customers away from Okta and Microsoft Entra ID. You translate complex identity market dynamics into product strategy, prioritize features across the dual-stack platform, and own the go-to-market positioning that determines whether the combined platform captures enterprise identity market share. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, comp is base-heavy with meaningful bonus targets and phantom equity participation units that give you upside exposure to the platform's valuation growth. Your product decisions directly shape the competitive trajectory of the identity market's strongest challenger. [Source: Ping Identity PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity PM (PM2-PM3) = Okta PM = CyberArk PM = SailPoint PM = ForgeRock PM = Microsoft Identity PM (L62-L63)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity product manager now owns roadmap decisions across the combined platform managing 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity deployments on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your product strategy must span cloud-native SaaS and on-prem deployment models simultaneously — a dual-modality product challenge no other identity company presents at this scale. "As a Product Manager defining the roadmap for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I own product strategy across 100M+ CIAM user environments. PMs who can navigate dual-stack identity product decisions command a Complexity Premium — this is the hardest identity product management in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **CIAM Product Strategy:** "I define product strategy for identity environments managing 100M+ consumer users — prioritizing authentication flows, identity orchestration features, and CIAM capabilities that win enterprise deals. Product managers who own strategy at CIAM scale command premium comp."
2. **Merger Roadmap Integration:** "I unify the PingOne and ForgeRock product roadmaps into a coherent platform vision — resolving feature overlap, identifying integration opportunities, and defining the combined platform's competitive differentiation. Merger product integration is the hardest PM challenge in identity."
3. **Okta/Microsoft Competitive Positioning:** "I own the competitive positioning against Okta and Microsoft Entra ID — defining the product strategy that wins enterprise identity deals. PMs who can position a challenger platform against established market leaders command premium comp."
4. **Enterprise Customer Impact:** "My product decisions directly determine which Fortune 500 enterprises choose Ping Identity over Okta and Microsoft. Product managers whose roadmap decisions drive enterprise revenue command comp reflecting that revenue impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $205K base and $95K phantom equity over 4 years with a 15% bonus target for this Product Manager role. I define the product roadmap for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform managing 100M+ CIAM users — unifying two identity product lines into the strongest challenger to Okta and Microsoft. I have competing offers from [Okta PM at $285K TC / SailPoint PM at $268K TC / CyberArk PM at $272K TC]. Product managers who can integrate merger roadmaps while winning against established identity leaders are exceptionally scarce." Accept at $185K+ base and $72K+ phantom equity.
