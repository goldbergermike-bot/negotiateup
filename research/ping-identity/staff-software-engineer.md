**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity Staff Software Engineers are the principal architects of the combined PingOne + ForgeRock identity platform — setting the technical vision for how cloud-native and on-prem identity systems merge into a unified architecture that manages 100M+ consumer identities. You define the platform's technical direction, solve the hardest cross-system integration challenges between PingOne and ForgeRock, drive org-wide architectural standards, and represent Ping Identity's technical authority in customer-facing identity design reviews with Fortune 500 enterprises. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, your comp structure is base-heavy with significant bonus targets and phantom equity participation units that vest over four years, giving you meaningful upside exposure to the combined platform's valuation. Your architectural decisions directly determine whether Ping Identity captures market share from Okta and Microsoft Entra ID. [Source: Ping Identity Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity Staff SWE (IC5) = Okta Staff SWE = CyberArk Staff SWE = SailPoint Staff SWE = ForgeRock Staff SWE = Microsoft Identity Principal SWE (L64-L65)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity engineer now operates across the combined platform managing 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity deployments on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your work spans cloud-native microservices and legacy on-prem identity trees simultaneously — a dual-stack identity engineering challenge no other company presents at this scale. "As a Staff Software Engineer setting the technical vision for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I architect the identity infrastructure managing 100M+ CIAM users across the world's largest enterprises. Staff engineers who define the merger integration architecture command the highest Complexity Premium — I own the hardest identity architecture problem in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Architecture Authority:** "I set the technical vision for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock identity platform — defining how two complete identity architectures merge into a unified system that manages 100M+ CIAM users. Staff engineers who own platform-level architecture decisions at this scale are the rarest talent in identity."
2. **Merger Integration Complexity:** "I solve the hardest cross-system integration challenges between PingOne cloud-native services and ForgeRock's on-prem identity engine. This merger integration architecture work is a once-in-a-decade technical challenge that requires deep expertise in both identity paradigms."
3. **Okta/Microsoft Principal Parity:** "Okta Staff SWEs earn $395K+ TC and Microsoft Identity Principal SWEs earn $420K+ TC. I'm defining the architectural vision for the platform that competes directly against both — my comp should reflect principal-level identity architecture impact."
4. **Pre-IPO Architect Premium:** "Staff engineers who define the combined platform architecture directly impact Ping Identity's enterprise win rate and valuation trajectory. My phantom equity participation units should reflect the outsized architectural leverage I have on the platform's competitive position and eventual exit."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $275K base and $168K phantom equity over 4 years with a 20% bonus target for this Staff Software Engineer role. I define the technical vision for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform — merging two complete identity architectures into a unified system managing 100M+ CIAM users. I have competing offers from [Okta Staff SWE at $398K TC / Microsoft Identity Principal SWE at $425K TC / CyberArk Staff SWE at $378K TC]. Staff engineers who can architect identity platform mergers at this scale are a once-in-a-decade hiring opportunity." Accept at $245K+ base and $132K+ phantom equity.
