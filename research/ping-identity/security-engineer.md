**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity Security Engineers are the guardians of the combined PingOne + ForgeRock identity platform — securing the authentication infrastructure, cryptographic systems, and identity data stores that protect 100M+ consumer identities for the world's largest enterprises. You perform security architecture reviews, conduct penetration testing of identity protocols, implement zero-trust controls, and ensure the platform meets the compliance requirements (SOC 2, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, GDPR) that Fortune 500 enterprises and government agencies demand. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, comp is base-heavy with meaningful bonus targets and phantom equity participation units. Your security work directly protects the trust foundation that identity platforms are built on. [Source: Ping Identity Security Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity Security (IC3-IC4) = Okta Security Engineer = CyberArk Security Engineer = SailPoint Security = ForgeRock Security = Microsoft Identity Security (L61-L63)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity security engineer now secures the combined platform protecting 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity deployments on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your security work spans two complete authentication architectures, two cryptographic systems, and two compliance frameworks simultaneously — a dual-stack security challenge where a breach in either system compromises the entire platform. "As a Security Engineer protecting the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I secure the identity infrastructure managing 100M+ CIAM users. Security engineers who can secure dual-stack identity platforms command the highest Complexity Premium — a breach in the identity platform is the most catastrophic security event in enterprise software."

**Global Levers**

1. **Identity Security Criticality:** "I secure the identity platform that protects 100M+ consumer identities — a breach of the identity infrastructure is the single most catastrophic security event possible for enterprise customers. Security engineers protecting identity platforms command premium comp reflecting that existential risk."
2. **Dual-Stack Security Architecture:** "I secure both PingOne's cloud-native authentication infrastructure and ForgeRock's on-prem identity systems — performing security reviews, penetration testing, and compliance audits across two complete identity security architectures simultaneously."
3. **Compliance + Regulatory Expertise:** "I ensure the combined platform meets SOC 2, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, and GDPR compliance requirements — the regulatory frameworks that determine whether Fortune 500 enterprises and government agencies can deploy the platform. Compliance-enabling security engineers directly impact enterprise revenue."
4. **Okta/CyberArk Security Parity:** "Okta Security Engineers earn $295K+ TC and CyberArk Security Engineers earn $285K+ TC. I'm securing the identity platform that competes directly against both — my comp should reflect the security criticality of protecting the challenger platform's 100M+ user environments."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base and $95K phantom equity over 4 years with a 15% bonus target for this Security Engineer role. I secure the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform protecting 100M+ CIAM users — dual-stack identity security where a breach is the most catastrophic event in enterprise software. I have competing offers from [Okta Security at $298K TC / CyberArk Security at $288K TC / Microsoft Identity Security at $305K TC]. Security engineers who can protect dual-stack identity platforms at CIAM scale are the trust foundation of the entire platform." Accept at $192K+ base and $72K+ phantom equity.
