### Senior Software Engineer | Ping Identity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Bonus + Participation Units | ForgeRock Merger Integration | PingOne Cloud Identity Platform | 100M+ CIAM Users | **IDENTITY PLATFORM BONUS**

| Region | Base Salary | Phantom Equity/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Denver | $178K–$225K | $62K–$108K | 15–20% | $218K–$305K |
| Austin | $172K–$218K | $62K–$108K | 15–20% | $212K–$298K |
| Remote US | $168K–$212K | $62K–$108K | 15–20% | $208K–$292K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity Senior Software Engineers are the technical backbone of the combined PingOne + ForgeRock identity platform — designing and implementing the authentication protocols, identity federation services, and CIAM orchestration engines that manage 100M+ consumer identities for the world's largest enterprises. You own critical subsystems across the unified identity stack, mentor junior engineers through the dual-stack complexity of cloud-native and on-prem identity, and drive the architectural decisions that determine whether the combined platform wins against Okta and Microsoft Entra ID. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, your comp is base-heavy with strong bonus targets and phantom equity participation units that provide upside exposure to the platform's growing valuation. Your technical leadership directly shapes the competitive trajectory of the identity market's strongest challenger. [Source: Ping Identity Sr SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity Sr SWE (IC4) = Okta Sr SWE = CyberArk Sr SWE = SailPoint Sr SWE = ForgeRock Sr SWE = Microsoft Identity Sr SWE (L62-L63)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity engineer now operates across the combined platform managing 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity deployments on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your work spans cloud-native microservices and legacy on-prem identity trees simultaneously — a dual-stack identity engineering challenge no other company presents at this scale. "As a Senior Software Engineer owning critical subsystems on the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I architect identity infrastructure managing 100M+ CIAM users. Senior engineers who can design across both identity stacks command a Complexity Premium — I own the hardest identity engineering problems in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **CIAM Architecture Ownership:** "I own the architecture of subsystems handling 100M+ consumer identity environments — designing authentication flows, token management, and identity federation at a scale only Ping Identity's combined platform demands. Senior engineers who architect at CIAM scale command premium comp."
2. **Dual-Stack Technical Leadership:** "I lead technical decisions across both PingOne cloud-native services and ForgeRock's on-prem identity engine. This dual-stack architecture ownership requires mastery of two complete identity paradigms — a complexity premium that few engineers in the market possess."
3. **Okta/Microsoft Competitive Parity:** "Okta Senior SWEs earn $305K+ TC and Microsoft Identity Senior SWEs earn $320K+ TC. I'm building the challenger platform that competes directly for the same enterprise contracts — my comp should reflect that competitive reality."
4. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Ping Identity's phantom equity participation units represent pre-IPO upside in the combined identity platform. I want strong base compensation reflecting the private company liquidity discount, plus participation units that reflect my architectural impact on the platform's valuation trajectory."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $222K base and $105K phantom equity over 4 years with a 20% bonus target for this Senior Software Engineer role. I own critical subsystems on the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform managing 100M+ CIAM users — dual-stack identity architecture that no other company demands at this scale. I have competing offers from [Okta Sr SWE at $308K TC / Microsoft Identity Sr SWE at $322K TC / CyberArk Sr SWE at $295K TC]. Senior engineers who can architect across cloud and on-prem identity stacks for 100M+ user environments are the scarcest talent in identity." Accept at $198K+ base and $82K+ phantom equity.
