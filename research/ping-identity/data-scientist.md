### Data Scientist | Ping Identity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Bonus + Participation Units | ForgeRock Merger Integration | PingOne Cloud Identity Platform | 100M+ CIAM Users | **IDENTITY ANALYTICS BONUS**

| Region | Base Salary | Phantom Equity/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Denver | $162K–$205K | $52K–$92K | 10–15% | $198K–$275K |
| Austin | $155K–$198K | $52K–$92K | 10–15% | $192K–$268K |
| Remote US | $152K–$192K | $52K–$92K | 10–15% | $188K–$262K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity Data Scientists analyze the identity signals, authentication patterns, and risk indicators across the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform — building the models that detect fraudulent access, optimize authentication flows, and provide identity intelligence across 100M+ CIAM user environments. You work with the richest identity dataset in the enterprise market, developing behavioral analytics, anomaly detection models, and identity risk scoring algorithms that protect the world's largest consumer identity deployments. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, comp is base-heavy with meaningful bonus targets and phantom equity participation units. Your models directly power the identity intelligence that differentiates Ping Identity from Okta and Microsoft Entra ID. [Source: Ping Identity DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity DS (IC3-IC4) = Okta DS = CyberArk DS = SailPoint DS = ForgeRock DS = Microsoft Identity DS (L61-L63)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity data scientist now works across the combined platform's identity data spanning 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity datasets on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your models must process identity signals from both cloud-native and on-prem systems simultaneously — a dual-source analytics challenge that produces the richest identity intelligence in the market. "As a Data Scientist analyzing identity data across the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I build models on 100M+ CIAM user datasets — the richest identity signal corpus in the enterprise market. Data scientists who can model across dual-stack identity environments command a Complexity Premium — this is the hardest identity analytics in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **CIAM-Scale Identity Analytics:** "I build models analyzing authentication patterns, risk signals, and behavioral data across 100M+ consumer identity environments. Data scientists who work with identity datasets at this CIAM scale — billions of authentication events, millions of user profiles — command premium comp over standard enterprise analytics."
2. **Fraud Detection + Risk Scoring:** "My models detect fraudulent access attempts, calculate identity risk scores, and optimize authentication flows in real time across the world's largest consumer identity deployments. The accuracy of my models directly impacts Ping Identity's enterprise value proposition."
3. **Dual-Source Data Integration:** "I analyze identity data from both PingOne cloud-native signals and ForgeRock on-prem identity logs — dual-source analytics that requires understanding two different identity data architectures. This merger data integration challenge is unique in identity analytics."
4. **Okta/Microsoft Analytics Parity:** "Okta Data Scientists earn $278K+ TC and Microsoft Identity Data Scientists earn $292K+ TC. I'm building the identity intelligence that competes directly against both platforms — my comp should reflect that competitive analytics impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $202K base and $88K phantom equity over 4 years with a 15% bonus target for this Data Scientist role. I build the identity analytics and risk models for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform — analyzing 100M+ CIAM user datasets that produce the richest identity intelligence in the market. I have competing offers from [Okta DS at $282K TC / Microsoft Identity DS at $295K TC / CyberArk DS at $265K TC]. Data scientists who can model identity risk across dual-stack platforms at CIAM scale are the scarcest analytics talent in identity." Accept at $182K+ base and $68K+ phantom equity.
