### CIAM Platform Engineer | Ping Identity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Bonus + Participation Units | ForgeRock Merger Integration | PingOne Cloud Identity Platform | 100M+ CIAM Users | **+20-30% CIAM COMPLEXITY PREMIUM** | **SIGNATURE ROLE**

| Region | Base Salary | Phantom Equity/4yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Denver | $208K–$262K | $92K–$162K | 15–20% | $272K–$385K |
| Austin | $202K–$255K | $92K–$162K | 15–20% | $265K–$378K |
| Remote US | $195K–$248K | $92K–$162K | 15–20% | $258K–$368K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity CIAM Platform Engineers are the signature role of the combined PingOne + ForgeRock identity platform — the engineers who build, scale, and operate the 100M+ user Consumer Identity and Access Management system that is the crown jewel of the merger. You architect the authentication orchestration, consent management, progressive profiling, identity federation, and consumer lifecycle management systems that power the world's largest CIAM deployments for Fortune 500 enterprises, governments, and global brands. The +20-30% CIAM Complexity Premium reflects the extraordinary technical demands of building consumer identity at planetary scale — handling billions of daily authentication events, managing identity across dozens of identity providers, and maintaining sub-50ms latency for consumer login flows that directly impact enterprise revenue. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, comp is base-heavy with significant bonus targets and phantom equity participation units that reflect your outsized impact on the platform's core value proposition. You are the engineer building the reason the ForgeRock merger happened. [Source: Ping Identity CIAM Platform Comp 2025-2026]

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. The CIAM Platform Engineer is the role that embodies the entire purpose of this merger — you build the combined consumer identity system that manages 100M+ users across the most complex CIAM environments on Earth. This is not merely a Complexity Premium; this is the Complexity Maximum. Your work spans the full identity stack: cloud-native authentication orchestration from PingOne, enterprise-grade identity lifecycle management from ForgeRock, consent and privacy management across global regulatory frameworks, identity federation across hundreds of identity providers, and consumer experience optimization at billions-of-events-per-day scale. No other role at Ping Identity — and no other role in the identity industry — operates at this intersection of scale, complexity, and business criticality. "As a CIAM Platform Engineer building the combined PingOne + ForgeRock consumer identity system, I architect and operate the 100M+ user CIAM platform that is the entire strategic rationale for the merger. CIAM Platform Engineers command the +20-30% Complexity Premium because we build the most complex identity systems in the world — every competing offer I receive reflects that there are fewer than 200 engineers globally who can build CIAM at this scale."

**Global Levers**

1. **CIAM Complexity Maximum — The Signature Premium:** "I build the 100M+ user CIAM platform that is the core value proposition of the PingOne + ForgeRock merger. The +20-30% CIAM Complexity Premium reflects that I operate at the intersection of consumer-scale authentication, enterprise-grade identity lifecycle, and global privacy compliance — the most complex identity engineering on Earth. Fewer than 200 engineers globally can build CIAM at this scale."
2. **Merger Raison d'Etre:** "The ForgeRock acquisition happened to create this combined CIAM platform. I am the engineer building the reason Thoma Bravo invested billions in this merger — my work directly determines whether the combined platform delivers on its investment thesis. My comp should reflect that strategic centrality."
3. **Consumer-Scale Identity Architecture:** "I architect authentication orchestration handling billions of daily events with sub-50ms latency, consent management across GDPR/CCPA/global regulations, progressive profiling for 100M+ consumer identities, and federation across hundreds of identity providers. This is full-stack identity at planetary scale."
4. **Okta/Auth0/Microsoft Platform Parity:** "Okta/Auth0 Staff Platform Engineers earn $398K+ TC and Microsoft Entra ID Platform Engineers earn $415K+ TC. I'm building the combined CIAM platform that directly challenges both — the platform that won the ForgeRock merger to create. My CIAM Complexity Premium should put my comp at or above competitor parity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $258K base and $158K phantom equity over 4 years with a 20% bonus target for this CIAM Platform Engineer role — the signature role of the PingOne + ForgeRock merger. I build the 100M+ user CIAM platform that is the entire strategic rationale for the acquisition — consumer-scale authentication orchestration, enterprise identity lifecycle, and global privacy compliance combined into the most complex identity system in the world. I have competing offers from [Okta/Auth0 Staff Platform at $402K TC / Microsoft Entra ID Platform at $418K TC / CyberArk CIAM at $375K TC]. There are fewer than 200 engineers globally who can build CIAM at this scale — the +20-30% CIAM Complexity Premium reflects that I build the reason this merger happened." Accept at $232K+ base and $125K+ phantom equity.
