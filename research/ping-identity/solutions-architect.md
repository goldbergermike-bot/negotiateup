**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity Solutions Architects are the technical bridge between the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform and enterprise customers — designing identity architectures for Fortune 500 companies deploying 100M+ CIAM user environments. You lead technical discovery, design complex identity federation and SSO architectures, build proof-of-concept implementations, and serve as the technical authority in competitive evaluations against Okta and Microsoft Entra ID. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, comp is base-heavy with meaningful bonus targets and phantom equity participation units. Your architectural guidance directly determines enterprise deal velocity and competitive win rates. [Source: Ping Identity SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity SA (SA2-SA3) = Okta SA = CyberArk SA = SailPoint SA = ForgeRock SA = Microsoft Identity CSA (L62-L63)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity solutions architect now designs customer deployments across the combined platform managing 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity deployments on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your architectural designs must leverage both cloud-native and on-prem identity capabilities — a dual-platform solutions challenge no other identity company presents at this scale. "As a Solutions Architect designing enterprise deployments of the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I architect identity solutions for 100M+ CIAM user environments. Solutions architects who can design across both identity stacks for the world's largest enterprises command a Complexity Premium — this is the hardest identity architecture consulting in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Deal Acceleration:** "I lead the technical sales process for enterprise identity deals — designing architectures that win Fortune 500 evaluations against Okta and Microsoft Entra ID. Solutions architects whose technical guidance directly accelerates six- and seven-figure deal closures command premium comp."
2. **Dual-Platform Architecture Design:** "I design identity architectures that leverage both PingOne's cloud-native capabilities and ForgeRock's on-prem strengths — creating hybrid deployment models that no competitor can match. This dual-platform solutions expertise is unique in the identity market."
3. **CIAM Deployment Expertise:** "I architect identity deployments for 100M+ consumer user environments — designing authentication flows, consent management, and identity federation at a scale only the combined Ping Identity platform handles. CIAM-scale architecture expertise commands premium comp."
4. **Competitive Technical Win Rate:** "My technical designs and proof-of-concept implementations directly determine Ping Identity's competitive win rate against Okta and Microsoft. Solutions architects whose architectural guidance consistently wins enterprise bake-offs command comp reflecting that revenue impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $205K base and $88K phantom equity over 4 years with a 15% bonus target for this Solutions Architect role. I design enterprise identity architectures for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform — architecting 100M+ CIAM user deployments that win competitive evaluations against Okta and Microsoft. I have competing offers from [Okta SA at $282K TC / Microsoft Identity CSA at $288K TC / SailPoint SA at $268K TC]. Solutions architects who can design dual-platform identity architectures at CIAM scale are the technical differentiator in enterprise deals." Accept at $182K+ base and $68K+ phantom equity.
