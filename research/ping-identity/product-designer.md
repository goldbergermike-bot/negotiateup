**Negotiation DNA**

Ping Identity Product Designers create the user experiences for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock identity platform — designing the authentication flows, admin consoles, identity orchestration interfaces, and CIAM experiences that 100M+ consumers and thousands of enterprise administrators interact with daily. You design experiences that make complex identity infrastructure accessible, unify the visual and interaction design language across two merged product lines, and create the UX that differentiates Ping Identity from Okta and Microsoft Entra ID in competitive evaluations. As a Thoma Bravo portfolio company, comp is base-heavy with bonus targets and phantom equity participation units. Your design decisions directly shape enterprise buyer perception and consumer authentication experience. [Source: Ping Identity Designer Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Ping Identity Designer (D2-D3) = Okta Designer = CyberArk Designer = SailPoint Designer = ForgeRock Designer = Microsoft Identity Designer (L60-L62)

**ForgeRock Merger — The Complexity Premium**

The completed ForgeRock merger created the most comprehensive identity platform in the market — combining PingOne's cloud-native identity orchestration with ForgeRock's battle-tested on-prem identity management used by governments and Fortune 500 enterprises. Every Ping Identity designer now creates experiences across the combined platform managing 100M+ CIAM user environments, the most complex consumer identity deployments on Earth. This Complexity Premium means your design work must unify two distinct product design languages into a coherent experience that serves both cloud-native and on-prem deployment models. "As a Product Designer unifying the experience of the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform, I design identity interfaces for 100M+ CIAM users and thousands of enterprise admins. Designers who can merge two identity product design systems while improving usability command a Complexity Premium — this is the hardest identity design challenge in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **CIAM Experience Design:** "I design authentication and identity experiences for 100M+ consumer users — every login flow, consent screen, and identity verification interaction I design is experienced by millions of people daily. Designers who create CIAM experiences at this scale command premium comp."
2. **Merger Design Unification:** "I unify two complete product design systems — PingOne's cloud-native UX and ForgeRock's enterprise admin experience — into a coherent design language. Design system unification during a platform merger is the hardest design challenge in enterprise identity."
3. **Competitive UX Differentiation:** "In competitive evaluations against Okta and Microsoft Entra ID, the admin and end-user experience is a key differentiator. My design work directly influences enterprise buying decisions — designers whose UX wins competitive bake-offs command premium comp."
4. **Enterprise + Consumer Dual Audience:** "I design for two radically different audiences simultaneously — enterprise identity administrators managing complex policy configurations and consumers experiencing seamless authentication. This dual-audience design challenge is unique to the CIAM space."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $165K base and $60K phantom equity over 4 years with a 15% bonus target for this Product Designer role. I design the unified experience for the combined PingOne + ForgeRock platform — merging two identity design systems while creating CIAM experiences for 100M+ users. I have competing offers from [Okta Designer at $218K TC / SailPoint Designer at $205K TC / CyberArk Designer at $198K TC]. Designers who can unify merger design systems while creating world-class CIAM experiences are exceptionally rare." Accept at $148K+ base and $48K+ phantom equity.
