### Edge Runtime Engineer — Fly.io Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Edge Runtime Engineers at Fly.io build the core runtime infrastructure — Firecracker microVM orchestration, the Machines API, global networking (Anycast, WireGuard), and the edge compute layer that enables developers to run full-stack applications close to users worldwide.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Chicago (USD) | Remote US (USD) |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Mid (IC2) | $170,000–$243,000 | $155,000–$225,000 |
| Senior (IC3) | $240,000–$323,000 | $223,000–$305,000 |
| Staff+ (IC4+) | $318,000–$415,000 | $300,000–$395,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, startup equity (stock options, 4-year vest), and potential bonus. Edge Runtime roles command a 5-10% premium due to specialized microVM, networking, and distributed systems expertise.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Fly.io

This is the signature engineering role at Fly.io. Edge Runtime Engineers build the platform's core infrastructure — the Firecracker microVM orchestration system (Machines API), global Anycast networking, WireGuard-based private networking, and the distributed systems that make "deploy anywhere" work reliably. This is deeply technical systems programming work.

Fly.io is a private startup headquartered in Chicago with a small, highly talented engineering team. The company uses Firecracker (the microVM technology behind AWS Lambda) as its compute primitive, running workloads in lightweight VMs that boot in under 100ms. Edge Runtime Engineers work at the intersection of virtualization, networking, and distributed systems — a rare combination of skills.

The small team and technical depth create a role where individual engineers have massive impact. Each Edge Runtime Engineer's work directly affects the experience of thousands of developers deploying on Fly.io.

#### Fly.io Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| IC2 | Edge Runtime Engineer | 2–4 years |
| IC3 | Senior Edge Runtime Engineer | 4–7 years |
| IC4 | Staff Edge Runtime Engineer | 7–12 years |
| IC5 | Principal Edge Runtime Engineer | 12+ years |

#### Lever 1: Firecracker MicroVM Orchestration

"Fly.io's Machines API orchestrates Firecracker microVMs globally. I bring experience with virtualization, container orchestration, or microVM management that directly advances this core capability."

#### Lever 2: Global Networking Engineering

"Fly.io's global networking — Anycast routing, WireGuard tunnels, distributed load balancing — enables seamless edge deployment. My networking expertise strengthens this critical infrastructure layer."

#### Lever 3: Distributed Systems at Edge Scale

"Running applications across 30+ global regions requires sophisticated distributed systems — consensus, state management, and failure handling. I bring the distributed systems expertise this demands."

#### Lever 4: Startup Equity for Core Infrastructure

"As an Edge Runtime Engineer building Fly.io's core technology, I expect a meaningful equity grant that reflects my foundational impact on the platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $195,000 base with equity valued at $70K-$110K/year (options). Accept-at floor: $270,000 total comp. Push for a larger option grant reflecting the core infrastructure nature of this role.
