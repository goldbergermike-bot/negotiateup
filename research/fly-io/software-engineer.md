Equity value depends on future fundraising rounds or exit. Startup equity carries higher risk but significant upside potential.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Fly.io

Fly.io is a private startup headquartered in Chicago that builds an edge application platform powered by Firecracker microVMs (the same technology behind AWS Lambda). The platform enables developers to deploy full-stack applications — servers, databases, storage — to regions close to their users with a simple CLI experience. Fly.io differentiates from traditional PaaS (Heroku, Railway) through its use of microVMs instead of containers, enabling stronger isolation and faster boot times.

As a small, well-funded startup, Fly.io offers the combination of high base salary, significant equity upside, and the technical depth of building a global edge application platform from the ground up. Engineers work on Firecracker microVM orchestration, global networking (Anycast, WireGuard), distributed databases (Fly Postgres, LiteFS), and the developer platform (flyctl CLI, Machines API).

The small team size means each engineer has outsized impact. Fly.io competes for talent with both Big Tech and other developer-focused startups (Vercel, Railway, Render).

#### Fly.io Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| IC2 | Software Engineer | 2–4 years |
| IC3 | Senior Software Engineer | 4–7 years |
| IC4 | Staff Software Engineer | 7–12 years |
| IC5 | Principal Software Engineer | 12+ years |

*Fly.io has a flat hierarchy with fewer levels than large companies. Leveling may be informal.*

#### Lever 1: Firecracker MicroVM Platform

"Fly.io is built on Firecracker microVMs — the same technology behind AWS Lambda. I bring experience with microVM orchestration, virtualization, or container runtime engineering that directly advances Fly.io's core platform."

#### Lever 2: Global Edge Infrastructure

"Fly.io operates infrastructure across 30+ regions. I build the global networking, Anycast routing, and WireGuard connectivity that makes edge deployment seamless."

#### Lever 3: Startup Equity Negotiation

"As an early-stage engineer at a well-funded startup, my contributions have outsized impact. I expect a meaningful equity grant that reflects my ability to build core platform capabilities with a small team."

#### Lever 4: Developer Experience Excellence

"Fly.io's flyctl CLI and developer experience are core differentiators. I bring a developer-first approach that keeps Fly.io's deployment experience magical."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $185,000 base with equity valued at $60K-$100K/year (options). Accept-at floor: $250,000 total comp (factoring equity at current valuation). Negotiate for a larger equity grant given startup risk.
