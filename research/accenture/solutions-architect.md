### Solutions Architect | Accenture Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + RSU Grants + Bonus (12-18%) | Technology Consulting Architecture Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $150K-$205K | $50K-$120K | $18K-$37K (12-18%) | $218K-$362K |
| San Francisco | $155K-$210K | $55K-$125K | $19K-$38K (12-18%) | $227K-$373K |
| London | £100K-£145K | £25K-£60K | £12K-£26K (12-18%) | £137K-£231K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Accenture are client-facing technical leaders who design technology architectures for the firm's largest consulting engagements. Accenture SAs work on enterprise transformations worth $10M-$200M+ — cloud migrations, ERP modernizations, AI platform deployments, and digital transformations for 95% of the Fortune 500. SAs at Accenture map to the Manager/Senior Manager level, with more substantial RSU grants, higher bonus (12-18%), and growing equity participation. Accenture's public company status means RSU grants have real market value. SAs also contribute to pre-sales, helping win competitive pitches against IBM, Deloitte, and cloud providers.

**Level Mapping:** Accenture Manager / Senior Manager (SA) = AWS Senior SA = Google Cloud Customer Engineer (L5) = Deloitte SM (SA)

**Global Levers**

1. **Engagement Revenue Enablement:** "I design architectures for engagements worth $10M-$200M. My technical credibility is what makes these deals viable and executable."
2. **RSU Maximization:** "At the SA level, RSUs should be $120K+ over 4 years. My architecture work directly drives Accenture's technology revenue."
3. **Pre-Sales Win Rate Impact:** "My architecture presentations help Accenture win competitive pitches against IBM, Deloitte, and cloud providers. I'm driving revenue, not just delivering it."
4. **Cloud Provider SA Benchmark:** "SAs at AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure earn $280K-$400K TC. Accenture's base + RSU + bonus needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm designing architectures for Accenture's largest client transformations. I need $200K base, RSUs worth $115K over 4 years, a 15% guaranteed bonus, and a $25K signing bonus. Cloud provider SA roles offer $310K-$380K TC." Accenture will counter at $180K-$190K base with $80K-$100K RSUs. Accept if total first-year TC exceeds $265K.
