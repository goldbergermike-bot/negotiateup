**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Accenture build data pipelines, data lakes, and analytics infrastructure for the firm's massive Data & AI practice. Accenture's data practice serves thousands of clients across every industry — you'll build data infrastructure for financial institutions, healthcare systems, retailers, and governments. As a public company, Accenture offers RSU grants that provide equity upside not available at MBB or most Big 4 firms. Bonus ranges 10-15%. The scale of Accenture's data practice means data engineers work with every major data platform — Databricks, Snowflake, AWS, Azure, GCP — building cross-platform expertise faster than at any single tech company.
