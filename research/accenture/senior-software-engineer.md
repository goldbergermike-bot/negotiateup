### Senior Software Engineer | Accenture Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + RSU Grants + Bonus (10-15%) | Consultant/Manager Level

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $140K-$185K | $45K-$100K | $14K-$28K (10-15%) | $175K-$313K |
| San Francisco | $145K-$190K | $50K-$110K | $15K-$29K (10-15%) | $183K-$329K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Accenture lead technical delivery for client engagements and internal platform development. At the Consultant/Manager level, Accenture's comp becomes more competitive — RSU grants increase meaningfully, and bonus trends toward the higher end of 10-15%. Senior engineers at Accenture are expected to lead technical design, manage delivery teams, and interface with client stakeholders. Accenture's public company status means RSU grants have real market value and daily liquidity — a significant advantage over private consulting firms. The firm's massive scale means senior engineers can choose to specialize in specific industries or technologies, building deep expertise while maintaining access to Accenture's global delivery network.

**Level Mapping:** Accenture Consultant / Manager = Google L4-L5 = Deloitte Manager = PwC Manager

**Global Levers**

1. **RSU Grant Escalation:** "At the senior level, RSU grants should increase significantly. I want $100K+ over 4 years, reflecting my technical leadership contribution."
2. **Client Delivery Leadership:** "I lead technical delivery for engagements worth $2M-$15M. My technical decisions directly determine client satisfaction and engagement profitability."
3. **Accenture's Public Company Advantage:** "Unlike MBB and most Big 4, Accenture offers liquid equity. This is a competitive advantage — I want to maximize it through a larger RSU allocation."
4. **AI Integration Premium:** "If I bring AI/ML skills: 'Engineers who can integrate AI into enterprise solutions command a 15-20% premium. Accenture's $3B AI investment means this expertise is in high demand.'"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm leading technical delivery at Accenture's senior level. I need $180K base, RSUs worth $95K over 4 years, and a 13% guaranteed bonus. I'd also like a $18K signing bonus. My tech alternatives offer $300K-$380K TC." Accenture will counter at $160K-$170K base with $70K-$85K RSUs. Accept if total first-year TC exceeds $220K.
