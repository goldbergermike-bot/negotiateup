**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Accenture work within the firm's Security practice — one of the largest cybersecurity consulting operations globally. Accenture Security serves government agencies, financial institutions, critical infrastructure operators, and Fortune 500 companies with managed security services, incident response, and security consulting. As a public company, Accenture offers RSU grants that provide equity upside alongside base and bonus (10-15%). Security engineers may work on client-facing engagements, internal security infrastructure, or Accenture's managed security services platform. The firm's $3B AI investment has created new security challenges that require specialized expertise. [Source: Accenture Security Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Accenture Consultant (Security) = Google L4 Security = CrowdStrike Senior = Deloitte Senior Consultant (Cyber)

**Global Levers**

1. **Security Practice Scale:** "Accenture's security practice is one of the world's largest. I'm joining a practice with massive client reach and the resources to invest in cutting-edge security capabilities."
2. **RSU Equity Push:** "Push for $85K+ in RSUs over 4 years. Security talent is scarce, and the RSU component should reflect this premium."
3. **Government & Clearance Premium:** "If holding security clearances: 'My clearance enables government and defense engagements that most engineers can't support. This access premium is 15-20%.'"
4. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers are the most supply-constrained talent in tech. Pure-play security companies pay $250K-$380K TC."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm joining Accenture's world-class security practice. I need $170K base, RSUs worth $80K over 4 years, and a 13% guaranteed bonus. Plus a $15K signing bonus. Security companies offer $260K-$350K TC." Accenture will counter at $150K-$160K base with $55K-$70K RSUs. Accept if total first-year TC exceeds $205K.
