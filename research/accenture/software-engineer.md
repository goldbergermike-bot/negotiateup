Accenture serves 95% of the Fortune 500, making it the world's largest technology consulting firm with $65B+ in revenue and $230B market cap. As a public company (ACN on NYSE), Accenture offers RSU grants that provide real equity upside — a significant advantage over MBB and most Big 4. Bonus ranges 10-15%. The sheer scale of Accenture means engineers work across every industry and technology stack imaginable. [Source: Accenture Technology Consulting 2025-2026]

3. **$3B AI Investment Opportunity:** "Accenture is investing $3B+ in AI. Software engineers who can build AI-integrated solutions are in high demand and should command a premium."
4. **Client Billing Revenue:** "Accenture bills my time at $150-$300/hour. At 1,800 billable hours, I generate $270K-$540K in revenue for the firm."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about Accenture's scale and client exposure. I need $165K base, RSUs worth $75K over 4 years, and a 12% guaranteed bonus. I'd also like a $15K signing bonus. My total first-year TC should reach $200K+." Accenture will counter at $145K-$155K base with $50K-$60K RSUs. Accept if total first-year TC reaches $190K+.
