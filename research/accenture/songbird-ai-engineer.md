### Songbird AI Engineer | Accenture Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + RSU Grants + Bonus (10-15%) | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+10-20% GENERATIVE AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $145K-$200K | $50K-$120K | $15K-$30K (10-15%) | $175K-$350K |
| San Francisco | $150K-$210K | $55K-$130K | $15K-$32K (10-15%) | $179K-$372K |
| Bangalore | ₹22L-₹42L | ₹8L-₹20L | ₹2L-₹6L (10-15%) | ₹32L-₹68L |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Accenture's signature AI engineering role. Songbird is Accenture's internal GenAI platform — an enterprise-grade AI orchestration system that powers the firm's AI consulting engagements. Songbird AI Engineers build the core LLM infrastructure, RAG pipelines, agent frameworks, and enterprise AI deployment systems that Accenture sells to its massive client base. Accenture is the world's largest IT services and consulting firm ($230B market cap, $65B+ revenue), and as a public company, it offers RSU grants that other consulting firms (MBB, Big 4 except PwC) do not. The RSU component makes Accenture's total comp more competitive than base + bonus alone would suggest. Bonus ranges 10-15%, and RSU grants vest over 4 years. Accenture has made massive AI investments — $3B+ committed to AI capabilities. [Source: Accenture AI Platform Engineering 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Accenture Consultant/Senior Analyst (Tech) = Google L3-L4 = Deloitte Senior Consultant = PwC Senior Associate

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Songbird AI Engineer builds Accenture's central AI delivery capability:
- **Enterprise GenAI Scale:** Building AI orchestration for the world's largest consulting firm's client base (95% of Fortune 500)
- **$3B AI Investment:** Accenture has committed $3B+ to AI, and Songbird is a core part of this investment
- **RSU Upside:** Unlike MBB and most Big 4, Accenture's public stock provides real equity upside
- **Global Delivery Network:** Your platform serves AI deployments across 120+ countries

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Investment Priority:** "Accenture has committed $3B+ to AI capabilities. Songbird is central to this investment. My engineering work directly builds the AI platform the firm is betting its future on."
2. **RSU Escalation:** "Accenture's RSU grants are my primary equity lever. I want the initial grant at $120K+ over 4 years, reflecting the GenAI premium and the strategic importance of Songbird."
3. **Client Revenue Platform:** "Every AI engagement Accenture sells — worth $1M-$50M+ — runs on the Songbird platform. I'm building the revenue engine for the firm's AI practice."
4. **Public Company Equity Advantage:** "Unlike McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and Deloitte, Accenture offers real equity with daily liquidity. Push for maximum RSU allocation — this is Accenture's key competitive advantage in comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the AI platform that powers Accenture's $3B AI investment. I need $195K base, RSUs worth $115K over 4 years, and a guaranteed 13% bonus. I also want a $20K signing bonus. The combination of base + equity + bonus should reach $245K+ first-year TC." Accenture will counter at $175K-$185K base with $80K-$100K RSUs. Push for RSU escalation. Accept if total first-year TC exceeds $230K.
