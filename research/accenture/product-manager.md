**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Accenture drive product strategy for the firm's internal technology platforms (including Songbird AI and MyNav), client-facing digital products, and the tools used across Accenture's 750,000+ employees. Accenture PMs operate at unprecedented scale — the firm serves 95% of the Fortune 500, and your product decisions can impact millions of end users. As a public company, Accenture's RSU grants provide equity upside not available at most consulting firms. Bonus ranges 10-15%, with RSUs as the primary variable comp lever. PMs at Accenture can specialize in AI, cloud, security, or industry-specific products. [Source: Accenture Technology Product Management 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Accenture Consultant / Manager (PM) = Google L4-L5 PM = Deloitte Manager PM = PwC Manager PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Scale Impact:** "I drive product strategy for platforms used by 750,000+ Accenture employees and thousands of clients. This scale of impact is rare in any PM role."
2. **RSU Equity Push:** "Push RSU grants to $95K+ over 4 years. As a public company, Accenture's equity is liquid and has appreciated 15%+ annually."
3. **AI Platform Product Ownership:** If touching Songbird: "I'm shaping product strategy for Accenture's flagship AI platform — the product at the center of the firm's $3B AI investment."
4. **Tech PM Comp Benchmark:** "PMs at Google, Meta, and Stripe earn $300K-$450K TC. Accenture's base + RSU + bonus combination needs to be competitive for experienced PMs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm driving product strategy at massive scale. I need $180K base, RSUs worth $90K over 4 years, and a 13% guaranteed bonus. Plus a $18K signing bonus. Tech PM offers are at $320K-$420K TC." Accenture will counter at $160K-$170K base with $60K-$75K RSUs. Accept if total first-year TC exceeds $220K.
