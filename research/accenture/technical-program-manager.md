**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Accenture coordinate complex multi-team technology programs — platform migrations, AI deployments, cloud transformations, and global delivery programs. Accenture's TPM role involves managing programs at unprecedented scale: projects spanning hundreds of engineers across multiple countries, with $10M-$100M+ in investment. As a public company, Accenture offers RSU grants alongside base and bonus (10-15%). The global delivery model adds unique complexity — TPMs coordinate teams across US, India, Philippines, and Europe. Program management at Accenture's scale requires both technical depth and cross-cultural leadership. [Source: Accenture Technology Program Management 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Accenture Consultant / Manager (TPM) = Google L4-L5 TPM = Amazon Senior TPM = Deloitte Manager TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Program Scale:** "I manage programs with $10M-$100M in investment across multiple geographies. The scale of program management at Accenture is unmatched."
2. **RSU Equity Push:** "Push for $90K+ in RSUs over 4 years. TPMs managing large programs should have equity that reflects the value they protect through successful delivery."
3. **Global Delivery Complexity:** "Coordinating teams across 5+ countries and time zones is significantly more complex than single-location program management."
4. **FAANG TPM Comp Gap:** "TPMs at Google, Meta, and Amazon earn $280K-$380K TC. Accenture's base + RSU + bonus needs to narrow this gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm managing large-scale global programs at Accenture. I need $175K base, RSUs worth $85K over 4 years, and a 13% guaranteed bonus. Plus a $18K signing bonus. FAANG TPM roles offer $300K-$370K TC." Accenture will counter at $155K-$165K base with $55K-$70K RSUs. Accept if total first-year TC exceeds $215K.
