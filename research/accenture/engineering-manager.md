**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Accenture lead technology delivery teams for client engagements and internal platforms at the Manager/Senior Manager level. Accenture's EMs manage teams of 8-20 engineers and are accountable for engagement delivery, team utilization, and client satisfaction. At this level, RSU grants become more substantial, and bonus increases to 12-18%. Accenture's scale means EMs can specialize in specific industries or technology areas while still managing teams across the firm's global delivery network. The Managing Director promotion (Accenture's Partner equivalent) is 3-5 years away, making this a critical career investment period. [Source: Accenture Technology Management 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Accenture Manager / Senior Manager = Google L5-L6 EM = Deloitte Manager/SM = PwC Director

**Global Levers**

1. **RSU Maximization:** "At the Manager/SM level, RSU grants should be $120K+ over 4 years. This is the primary lever for making Accenture's comp competitive with tech companies."
2. **Global Team Leadership:** "I manage teams spanning multiple geographies in Accenture's global delivery model. The complexity of cross-cultural, cross-timezone management warrants a premium."
3. **Client Portfolio P&L:** "I own delivery P&L for engagements worth $5M-$25M annually. My management directly determines whether these engagements are profitable."
4. **MD Track Investment:** "I'm 3-5 years from Managing Director ($500K-$1M+ comp). My current package should reflect this investment trajectory."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm leading engineering teams that deliver Accenture's highest-value engagements. I need $195K base, RSUs worth $115K over 4 years, and a 15% guaranteed bonus. Plus a $25K signing bonus. Tech EM roles offer $380K-$480K TC." Accenture will counter at $175K-$185K base with $80K-$100K RSUs. Accept if total first-year TC exceeds $265K.
