**Level Mapping:** Accenture Consultant (Data Science) = Google L4 Data Scientist = Meta IC4 DS = Deloitte Manager (DS)

**Global Levers**

1. **RSU Equity Push:** "Accenture's RSU grants are the primary equity lever. I want $95K+ over 4 years, reflecting the premium for data science expertise in Accenture's AI-focused strategy."
2. **Applied Intelligence Scale:** "Accenture's Applied Intelligence practice is the largest in consulting. I'll work on more AI deployments across more industries than any other employer can offer."
3. **GenAI Data Science Premium:** "Data scientists who can work with LLMs, fine-tune models, and build GenAI applications command a 15-20% premium. Accenture's $3B AI investment depends on this expertise."
4. **MBB Data Scientist Comp Comparison:** "Data scientists at MBB earn $220K-$360K TC (all cash). Accenture's base + RSU + bonus needs to be competitive with the lower end of this range."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm bringing data science expertise to Accenture's largest AI practice. I need $175K base, RSUs worth $90K over 4 years, and a 13% guaranteed bonus. Plus a $18K signing bonus. MBB pays $250K-$350K TC cash for comparable roles." Accenture will counter at $155K-$165K base with $60K-$75K RSUs. Accept if total first-year TC exceeds $215K.
