**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Accenture work within Accenture Song (formerly Accenture Interactive) — one of the world's largest digital design and marketing agencies. Accenture Song has over 45,000 professionals and is recognized as a design powerhouse, winning numerous industry awards. Designers create enterprise products, digital experiences, and service design systems for Fortune 500 clients. As a public company, Accenture offers RSU grants alongside base and bonus (10-15%) — a meaningful equity component not available at most consulting firms. The design practice combines creative excellence with consulting methodology, producing work at massive enterprise scale. [Source: Accenture Song Design Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Accenture Analyst / Consultant (Design) = Google L3-L4 UX = Meta IC3-IC4 Designer = Deloitte Consultant (Design)

**Global Levers**

1. **Accenture Song Brand:** "Accenture Song is one of the world's largest and most awarded design agencies. My work carries this brand premium and impacts enterprise-scale products."
2. **RSU Equity Lever:** "Push for $65K+ in RSUs over 4 years. This equity component differentiates Accenture from other consulting firms for design talent."
3. **Cross-Industry Design Portfolio:** "Designing for Accenture Song gives me a portfolio spanning every major industry — healthcare, finance, automotive, retail. This breadth is impossible at a single-product company."
4. **Enterprise Design Scale:** "I design products deployed to millions of end users at enterprise scale. The complexity and impact of enterprise design at Accenture exceeds most tech company roles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm joining one of the world's largest design agencies. I need $150K base, RSUs worth $60K over 4 years, and a 12% guaranteed bonus. Plus a $12K signing bonus. Tech design roles offer $220K-$310K TC." Accenture will counter at $130K-$140K base with $35K-$50K RSUs. Accept if total first-year TC reaches $175K+.
