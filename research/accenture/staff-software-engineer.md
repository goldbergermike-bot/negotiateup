### Staff Software Engineer | Accenture Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + RSU Grants + Bonus (12-18%) | Senior Manager / Managing Director Level

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $165K-$215K | $70K-$150K | $20K-$39K (12-18%) | $253K-$404K |
| San Francisco | $170K-$225K | $75K-$160K | $20K-$41K (12-18%) | $264K-$426K |
| London | £110K-£155K | £35K-£80K | £13K-£28K (12-18%) | £158K-£263K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Accenture map to the Senior Manager / Managing Director level — the tier where Accenture's comp structure includes substantial RSU grants, higher bonus percentages (12-18%), and proximity to the Managing Director promotion (Accenture's equivalent of Partner). At this level, you're setting technical direction for practice areas, leading multiple delivery teams, and representing Accenture's technical capabilities in client pitches and analyst briefings. Accenture's RSU grants at this level are the largest comp lever — push hard on initial grant size. The Managing Director promotion (2-4 years away) brings comp to $500K-$1M+.

**Level Mapping:** Accenture Senior Manager / MD = Google L5-L6 = Deloitte Senior Manager/Director = PwC Director/MD

**Global Levers**

1. **RSU Maximization:** "At this level, RSUs are the primary variable comp lever. I want the initial grant at $150K+ over 4 years. Accenture's stock has appreciated 15%+ annually — maximizing RSUs compounds wealth creation."
2. **Practice Area Technical Authority:** "I set technical direction for an entire practice area at the world's largest IT services firm. My decisions affect thousands of engineers and billions in engagement revenue."
3. **MD Track Investment:** "I'm 2-4 years from Managing Director, where comp jumps to $500K-$1M+. My current comp should reflect this proximity and the firm's investment in my progression."
4. **FAANG Staff Benchmark:** "Staff engineers at FAANG earn $450K-$650K TC. Accenture's $300K-$425K TC is more competitive than other consulting firms but still has a gap. RSU escalation is the way to close it."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm setting technical direction at the pre-MD level. I need $210K base, RSUs worth $140K over 4 years, a 15% guaranteed bonus, and a $30K signing bonus. My FAANG alternatives are at $480K-$600K TC." Accenture will counter at $190K-$200K base with $100K-$120K RSUs. Push on RSU escalation. Accept if total first-year TC exceeds $300K.
