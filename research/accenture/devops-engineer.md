DevOps Engineers at Accenture work within the firm's Cloud First practice — managing cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and production deployments for client engagements and internal platforms. Accenture Cloud First is a $20B+ business unit focused on cloud migration, modernization, and managed services. DevOps engineers at Accenture work across AWS, Azure, and GCP, building multi-cloud competency that's rare in the market. As a public company, Accenture offers RSU grants alongside base and bonus (10-15%). The cloud practice is a major growth driver for the firm, and DevOps engineers are critical to delivery capacity.
