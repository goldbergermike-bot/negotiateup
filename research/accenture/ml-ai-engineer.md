**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Accenture build production AI systems for the firm's Applied Intelligence practice and the Songbird AI platform. Accenture has committed $3B+ to AI capabilities, making ML/AI engineers among the most strategically important hires at the firm. This role involves deploying enterprise AI at massive scale — across industries, geographies, and use cases. Accenture's public company status means RSU grants provide real equity upside, and the firm's AI investment creates strong demand for engineers who can deliver production ML systems. Bonus ranges 10-15%, with RSU grants providing the primary variable comp component. [Source: Accenture Applied Intelligence ML Engineering 2025-2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **$3B AI Investment Priority:** "Accenture's $3B AI commitment puts ML engineers at the center of the firm's growth strategy. My comp should reflect this strategic priority."
2. **RSU Escalation:** "Push RSU grants to $100K+ over 4 years. ML/AI talent commands a premium, and Accenture's equity is the way to express that premium."
3. **Enterprise AI Scale:** "I'll deploy AI across more industries and client environments than any single tech company can offer. This breadth of production AI experience is uniquely valuable."
4. **AI Company Competition:** "ML engineers at AI companies earn $350K-$550K TC with equity. Accenture needs to be competitive through base + RSU + bonus combination."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building AI systems at the center of Accenture's $3B investment. I need $175K base, RSUs worth $95K over 4 years, and a 13% guaranteed bonus. Plus a $18K signing bonus. AI companies offer $370K-$450K TC." Accenture will counter at $155K-$165K base with $65K-$80K RSUs. Accept if total first-year TC exceeds $215K.
