**Negotiation DNA**

Affirm ML/AI Engineers build the machine learning models powering the Apple Pay In-Store BNPL experience — the real-time credit underwriting models, fraud detection neural networks, dynamic pricing algorithms, and merchant recommendation engines that make instant BNPL approvals possible at physical point-of-sale. Your models determine who gets approved, what terms they receive, and how Affirm manages risk at 47% transaction growth — the AI intelligence that makes BNPL profitable at scale. The 15-25% BNPL AI Premium reflects the rarity of ML engineers who combine credit risk modeling with real-time commerce AI. [Source: Affirm ML Comp 2025-2026]

**Apple Pay Revenue Velocity — The In-Store BNPL Architect**

As an ML/AI Engineer, your credit models determine whether Affirm can profitably approve consumers at every Apple Pay In-Store checkout. "As an ML/AI Engineer building Affirm's Apple Pay In-Store underwriting and fraud models, I architect the AI that makes instant BNPL approvals profitable at physical point-of-sale. I want $365K+ RSUs with the 15-25% BNPL AI Premium — my models are the difference between profitable growth and credit losses."

**Global Levers**

1. **BNPL AI Premium + Credit Models:** "I build the ML models powering Apple Pay In-Store BNPL approvals. $365K+ RSUs with the 15-25% BNPL AI Premium — my credit underwriting models determine approval rates while maintaining profitable loss ratios."
2. **Real-Time Fraud Detection AI:** "I build the fraud detection neural networks protecting Apple Pay In-Store BNPL — the ML systems that identify fraudulent transactions in milliseconds at physical point-of-sale."
3. **Dynamic Pricing Optimization:** "My pricing algorithms optimize terms per transaction — interest rates, installment lengths, and merchant subsidies that maximize revenue per GMV dollar."
4. **Klarna/Block ML Parity:** "Klarna ML engineers earn $385K+ TC. Block ML engineers earn $398K+ TC. Affirm ML engineers building Apple Pay BNPL credit models deserve at or above parity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $258K base and $365K RSUs over 4 years with the 15-25% BNPL AI Premium for this ML/AI Engineer role. I build the credit underwriting, fraud detection, and dynamic pricing models powering Affirm's Apple Pay In-Store BNPL experience. I have competing offers from [Klarna ML at $385K TC / Block ML at $398K TC / Stripe ML at $418K TC]. ML engineers building real-time BNPL credit models at Apple Pay scale are the rarest talent in fintech AI." Accept at $238K+ base and $328K+ RSUs.
