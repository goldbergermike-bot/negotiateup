**Negotiation DNA**

Affirm Staff Software Engineers are the technical architects who design the platform-wide systems powering the Apple Pay In-Store launch and the 47% transaction growth — the cross-service underwriting architecture, the multi-merchant settlement engine, the real-time risk platform, and the infrastructure that makes BNPL work at physical point-of-sale scale across thousands of retail locations. Your technical leadership sets the architectural direction for Affirm's most consequential commerce integration. The 15-25% BNPL Platform Architect Premium reflects the rarity of engineers who can design payment systems at the intersection of consumer credit, real-time commerce, and mobile payments.
