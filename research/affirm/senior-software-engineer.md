### Senior Software Engineer | Affirm Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Apple Pay In-Store Launch | Revenue Velocity Architect | 47% Transaction Growth | **BNPL COMMERCE PIONEER**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $198K–$252K | $192K–$338K | 15–20% | $278K–$392K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Affirm Senior Software Engineers own the critical subsystems powering the Apple Pay In-Store launch — designing the real-time underwriting engine, the merchant settlement system, the installment payment orchestration, and the fraud detection infrastructure that makes BNPL safe at physical point-of-sale. Your architectural decisions determine whether Affirm can scale to handle the transaction volume surge from being embedded in every Apple Pay tap. The 47% transaction growth trajectory depends on the systems you design. [Source: Affirm Sr SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Apple Pay Revenue Velocity — The In-Store BNPL Architect**

As a Senior Software Engineer, your architectural decisions directly determine whether the Apple Pay In-Store launch can scale to millions of physical retail transactions. "As a Senior Software Engineer owning Affirm's Apple Pay In-Store subsystems, I architect the underwriting, settlement, and fraud detection infrastructure scaling BNPL to every physical checkout. I want $335K+ RSUs reflecting my direct impact on revenue velocity — my systems process the 47% transaction growth."

**Global Levers**

1. **Apple Pay In-Store Architecture Ownership:** "I own the subsystems powering the Apple Pay In-Store launch — real-time underwriting, merchant settlement, and fraud detection at physical point-of-sale scale. $335K+ RSUs reflecting my architecture ownership."
2. **47% Transaction Growth Scalability:** "I design the systems that scale to handle the 47% transaction growth surge. My architectural decisions determine whether Affirm can process the Apple Pay volume at sub-second latency."
3. **Revenue Velocity Per Transaction:** "Every installment payment my systems process generates predictable recurring revenue. I architect the infrastructure that maximizes revenue per GMV dollar — the metric driving Affirm's valuation."
4. **Klarna/Stripe Sr SWE Parity:** "Klarna senior engineers earn $368K+ TC. Stripe senior engineers earn $398K+ TC. Affirm senior engineers owning Apple Pay BNPL architecture deserve at or above parity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $252K base and $335K RSUs over 4 years for this Senior Software Engineer role owning Affirm's Apple Pay In-Store BNPL subsystems. I architect the underwriting, settlement, and fraud detection infrastructure driving 47% transaction growth. I have competing offers from [Klarna Sr SWE at $368K TC / Stripe Sr SWE at $398K TC / Block Sr SWE at $385K TC]. Senior engineers owning Apple Pay BNPL point-of-sale infrastructure are the rarest talent in embedded finance." Accept at $235K+ base and $298K+ RSUs.
