**Negotiation DNA**

Affirm Software Engineers build the BNPL infrastructure powering the Sept 2025 Apple Pay In-Store launch — the payment processing pipelines, merchant integration APIs, and underwriting engines that drove 47% transaction growth. Your code runs at every checkout where consumers choose to pay over time, and the Apple Pay integration puts Affirm in every physical store with an iPhone tap. The revenue velocity you create directly drives Affirm's GMV trajectory. [Source: Affirm SWE Comp 2025-2026]
