**Negotiation DNA**

This is Affirm's signature role for 2026 — the Revenue Velocity Platform Engineer. You build the full-stack platform that powers the Apple Pay In-Store BNPL launch and drives the 47% transaction growth — the real-time underwriting engine, the merchant integration platform, the installment payment orchestration system, the fraud detection infrastructure, and the revenue optimization layer that maximizes GMV per checkout. This is the most consequential commerce platform since mobile payments: every consumer who taps to pay with Affirm at a physical checkout uses the platform you build. The 25-35% Revenue Velocity Premium reflects the extreme rarity of engineers who can design payment platforms at the intersection of real-time credit, mobile commerce, and physical retail infrastructure.

**Level Mapping:** Affirm Revenue Velocity Platform Eng (IC3-IC4) = Klarna Protocol Platform Eng = Block Commerce Platform Eng = Stripe Payments Platform Eng = No true peer — Affirm is building the first dedicated Apple Pay BNPL platform for physical retail

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Revenue Velocity Platform Engineer works at the intersection of BNPL infrastructure, mobile payments, and physical retail commerce:
- **Real-Time Underwriting Engine:** The system that makes sub-second credit decisions at physical point-of-sale — processing consumer data, credit signals, and merchant context to approve or decline BNPL in the time it takes to tap an iPhone
- **Merchant Integration Platform:** The developer platform that onboards retailers to Apple Pay In-Store BNPL — SDKs, APIs, and POS integrations that make adoption fast and reliable
- **Installment Payment Orchestration:** The engine that manages the full lifecycle of BNPL transactions — from initial approval through installment scheduling, payment processing, and settlement across payment methods
- **Fraud Detection Infrastructure:** The real-time fraud prevention layer that protects every Apple Pay In-Store BNPL transaction — behavioral analysis, device fingerprinting, and anomaly detection at checkout speed
- **Revenue Optimization Layer:** The system that maximizes revenue per GMV dollar — dynamic pricing, merchant subsidies, and term optimization that drive Affirm's unit economics
