| Bay Area Remote | $155K–$220K | $80K–$210K/4yr | 18–25% | $225K–$365K |
| Other US | $150K–$210K | $70K–$195K/4yr | 18–25% | $210K–$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Genentech build machine learning systems that directly accelerate drug discovery — one of the highest-leverage applications of AI in any industry. Genentech's ML capabilities span molecular property prediction (predicting drug candidate efficacy and toxicity from molecular structure), protein structure prediction (AlphaFold-style approaches for target identification), clinical trial optimization (adaptive trial design, patient matching), image analysis (pathology, radiology), NLP (extracting insights from scientific literature and clinical notes), and real-world evidence analytics. The AI/ML premium at Genentech is significant — 15-25% above standard engineering bands — because drug discovery ML talent combines rare ML engineering skills with even rarer biological domain knowledge. Bay Area biotech competes aggressively with Google DeepMind, Recursion, Insitro, and Microsoft Research for this talent. [Source: Genentech AI/ML Research and Engineering 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Genentech ML Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML = Recursion Senior ML = Insitro Senior ML

**Global Levers**

1. **Drug Discovery AI Premium:** "ML engineers who can build models for molecular property prediction, protein folding, and clinical trial optimization are among the rarest talent in tech. I'm not building ad-click models — I'm building models that discover medicines. The AI premium should be at the top of band."
2. **Bay Area AI Market:** "AI/ML engineers in Bay Area biotech command $240K-$380K TC. Genentech competes with Google DeepMind, Recursion, and Insitro for this talent."
3. **Biological Domain + ML Engineering:** "I combine production ML engineering (model training, serving, monitoring) with biological domain knowledge. This dual expertise is the rarest skill combination in biotech — most researchers can't engineer, and most engineers can't understand biology."
4. **R&D Pipeline Impact:** "A successful ML model can identify drug targets worth billions, predict clinical trial outcomes, or optimize patient selection. The ROI on a well-compensated ML engineer is astronomical in drug discovery."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $225K with RSUs at $200K/4yr and a 25% bonus target. My drug discovery ML experience — specifically [molecular modeling / clinical prediction / protein engineering] at [current company] — directly accelerates Genentech's AI-driven R&D pipeline." Genentech will counter at $185K-$215K base with $110K-$175K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $310K. Push on bonus target — Genentech has strong bonus flexibility for AI roles.
