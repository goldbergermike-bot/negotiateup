### Data Scientist | Genentech Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Roche Subsidiary / Bay Area Biotech Premium / RSU + Bonus / Drug Discovery Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| South San Francisco | $155K–$215K | $70K–$195K/4yr | 15–22% | $210K–$340K |
| Bay Area Remote | $145K–$205K | $65K–$185K/4yr | 15–22% | $195K–$320K |
| Other US | $140K–$195K | $60K–$170K/4yr | 15–22% | $185K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Genentech work at the intersection of statistics, biology, and drug development — building models that influence which drug candidates advance, how clinical trials are designed, and which patients respond best to treatments. The role is uniquely high-impact in biotech: a successful predictive model for patient stratification can mean the difference between a $5B blockbuster drug and a failed clinical trial. Genentech's data scientists work on biomarker discovery (identifying molecular signatures that predict drug response), clinical trial optimization (adaptive trial design, patient recruitment), real-world evidence analytics (post-market drug effectiveness), and commercial analytics (market access, pricing optimization). The company values statistical rigor — many data scientists hold PhDs — but also values engineers who can build production systems, not just Jupyter notebooks. Bay Area biotech comp for data scientists is premium. [Source: Genentech Data Science Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Genentech Data Scientist = Google L4 DS = Moderna DS = Illumina DS (higher TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Drug Discovery Impact:** "My models directly influence Genentech's R&D pipeline — which targets to pursue, which patients to enroll, which biomarkers to track. A single successful model can influence a drug program worth billions."
2. **Bay Area DS Market:** "Data scientists in Bay Area biotech command $210K-$340K TC. Genentech's offer should reflect this market, not health IT benchmarks."
3. **Biostatistics + ML Hybrid:** "I combine traditional biostatistics (survival analysis, causal inference, mixed-effects models) with modern ML engineering (deep learning, NLP, production deployment). This hybrid skillset is exactly what Genentech needs."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "Genentech DS bonus targets range from 15-22%. I'm targeting 22% given my [drug discovery analytics / clinical trial modeling / biomarker] expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $210K with RSUs at $175K/4yr and a 22% bonus target. My biotech data science experience — specifically [biomarker discovery / clinical trial optimization / patient stratification] at [current company] — directly accelerates Genentech's highest-priority analytics." Genentech will counter at $175K-$200K base with $90K-$150K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $280K. Push on bonus target.
