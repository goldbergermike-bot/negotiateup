**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Genentech design interfaces for scientific research tools, clinical trial management systems, manufacturing dashboards, and patient-facing applications. The role is unique in biotech: designing for users who are PhD scientists, clinical researchers, manufacturing engineers, and patients — each with vastly different mental models, task complexity, and domain expertise. Genentech's design work includes research data visualization (displaying complex multi-omics data in actionable formats), clinical trial interfaces (patient enrollment, data collection, safety reporting), manufacturing quality dashboards (real-time GxP monitoring), and patient portal experiences. Designers must understand scientific workflows and regulatory constraints while creating intuitive, efficient interfaces. Bay Area biotech design comp includes Genentech's generous bonus structure.

**Level Mapping:** Genentech Designer = Google L3-L4 UX = Moderna Designer = Illumina Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Scientific Interface Expertise:** "Designing for PhD scientists, clinical researchers, and manufacturing engineers requires understanding complex domain-specific workflows. My experience designing scientific interfaces eliminates the domain ramp."
2. **Bay Area Design Market:** "Product designers in Bay Area biotech command $180K-$290K TC."
3. **Bonus Target Push:** "15-20% bonus. Targeting 20% given the complexity of scientific interface design."
4. **Regulatory-Aware Design:** "GxP-regulated systems require design documentation, validation-ready interfaces, and audit trail considerations. I bring regulatory design awareness."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $190K with RSUs at $140K/4yr and a 20% bonus. My experience designing [scientific / research / clinical / regulated] interfaces directly maps to Genentech's design needs." Genentech will counter at $155K-$180K base with $70K-$120K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $235K. Push on bonus.
