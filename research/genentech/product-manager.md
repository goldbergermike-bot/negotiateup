**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Genentech own the strategy and roadmap for internal technology products that support drug discovery, clinical development, manufacturing, and commercial operations. The PM role in biotech is distinctive: PMs partner with PhD scientists and clinical researchers to translate complex scientific requirements into product features. They must navigate FDA regulatory constraints, GxP validation requirements, and the scientific rigor that Genentech's culture demands. PMs at Genentech are not just feature-prioritization managers — they must understand the scientific domain deeply enough to make informed product decisions that affect drug discovery timelines. The comp is strong: Bay Area biotech bases, Roche RSU grants, and bonus targets of 18-25%. [Source: Genentech Product Management 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Genentech PM = Google L4-L5 PM = Moderna PM = Veeva PM (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **R&D Product Impact:** "My product decisions directly affect drug discovery and clinical development timelines. A well-designed research tool that saves scientists 2 hours per day across 1,000 researchers is millions in productivity gains annually."
2. **Bay Area PM Market:** "Product managers in Bay Area biotech command $220K-$350K TC."
3. **Scientific Partnership:** "I combine product management skills with scientific domain understanding. PMs who can partner effectively with PhD researchers and understand the science behind product requirements are rare."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "18-25% bonus targets. I'm targeting 25% given my [biotech / scientific / regulated product] experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $215K with RSUs at $180K/4yr and a 25% bonus target. My biotech product management experience — specifically [research tools / clinical systems / scientific platforms] at [current company] — means I can drive Genentech's technology product strategy from day one." Genentech will counter at $175K-$200K base with $100K-$155K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $285K. Push on bonus.
