**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Genentech drive complex, cross-functional technology programs that support drug discovery, clinical development, and manufacturing. TPMs coordinate across R&D informatics, clinical systems, manufacturing technology, and commercial platforms — navigating a matrixed organization that includes both Genentech and Roche stakeholders. Programs at Genentech often have regulatory dimensions: clinical system implementations must meet FDA validation timelines, manufacturing technology programs have GxP compliance requirements, and research data platforms must satisfy data integrity regulations. TPMs must be technically fluent, scientifically curious, and skilled at managing programs where scientists, engineers, and regulatory teams have competing priorities.

**Level Mapping:** Genentech TPM = Google L4-L5 TPM = Moderna TPM = Illumina TPM (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **R&D Program Impact:** "The technology programs I manage directly affect drug discovery timelines. A well-executed platform migration or research tool deployment can accelerate an R&D program worth billions."
2. **Bay Area TPM Market:** "TPMs in Bay Area biotech command $220K-$345K TC."
3. **Regulatory Program Expertise:** "I bring experience managing programs with FDA validation requirements, GxP compliance, and regulatory submission timelines. These constraints add significant complexity that general TPMs struggle with."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "18-22% bonus. Targeting 22% given the regulatory complexity and R&D impact of programs I'll manage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $210K with RSUs at $175K/4yr and a 22% bonus. My experience managing technology programs in [biotech / pharma / regulated environments] directly maps to Genentech's highest-priority programs." Genentech will counter at $175K-$200K base with $90K-$150K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $280K. Push on bonus.
