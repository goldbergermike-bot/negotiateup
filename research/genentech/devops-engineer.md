**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Genentech manage the infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines for one of the most heavily regulated software environments outside of defense. Biotech infrastructure must satisfy FDA GxP (Good Practice) requirements, 21 CFR Part 11 (electronic records), HIPAA for clinical data, and Roche's internal quality standards. DevOps engineers build validated deployment pipelines, manage cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure), implement infrastructure-as-code, and ensure every deployment meets audit requirements. The role is uniquely complex because GxP-validated environments have stricter change control requirements than standard enterprise deployments — every infrastructure change must be documented, tested, and approved through a formal validation process. Genentech's DevOps team is also driving cloud migration from legacy on-premises lab and research infrastructure. [Source: Genentech IT Infrastructure 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Genentech DevOps = Google L3-L4 SRE = Moderna DevOps = Illumina DevOps (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **GxP Infrastructure Expertise:** "GxP-validated DevOps is not standard DevOps. Every deployment pipeline, infrastructure change, and access control must satisfy FDA audit requirements. My experience with [GxP / validated systems / FDA compliance] eliminates the 6-12 month regulatory ramp."
2. **Bay Area DevOps Market:** "DevOps engineers in the Bay Area command $200K-$320K TC. Genentech competes with Big Tech and biotech startups for this talent."
3. **Cloud Migration Value:** "Genentech is migrating research and lab infrastructure to the cloud. DevOps engineers who can lead this migration while maintaining GxP compliance bring forward-looking value."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "15-20% bonus target. I'm targeting 20% given the regulatory complexity of GxP DevOps."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with RSUs at $165K/4yr and a 20% bonus. My regulated DevOps experience with [GxP / FDA compliance / validated systems] at [current company] directly maps to Genentech's infrastructure needs." Genentech will counter at $170K-$195K base with $85K-$140K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $260K. Push on bonus target.
