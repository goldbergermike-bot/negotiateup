**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Genentech lead technical design and architecture for systems that support the biotech R&D pipeline. At the senior level, engineers own platform decisions that affect research data management, clinical trial operations, manufacturing quality systems, and commercial analytics. Genentech values senior engineers who combine technical leadership with scientific curiosity — understanding the biological context of the systems they build. The comp at senior level is strong: Bay Area biotech bases top $220K, Roche RSUs provide stable equity, and bonus targets of 18-22% create meaningful TC advantage over many tech companies. Senior engineers at Genentech have the rare privilege of seeing their platform work contribute to medicines that improve patient lives — a mission alignment that the company leverages in recruiting.

**Level Mapping:** Genentech Senior SWE = Google L4-L5 = Moderna Senior = Illumina Senior (higher TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Bay Area Senior Engineer Market:** "Senior software engineers in the Bay Area biotech corridor command $230K-$360K TC. Genentech's offer needs to be competitive with Google, Recursion, Insitro, and well-funded biotech startups for senior engineering talent."
2. **R&D Platform Leadership:** "As a senior engineer, my platform decisions affect the efficiency of Genentech's entire R&D pipeline — 80+ molecules in development. The leverage of good platform architecture on drug discovery timelines is enormous."
3. **Bonus Target Push:** "Genentech's senior engineering bonus targets range from 18-22%. I'm targeting 22% given my [specific domain expertise / platform leadership experience]. The 4% delta on a $200K base is meaningful."
4. **Roche Global Stability:** "Roche's $60B+ annual revenue provides exceptional financial stability. The RSU grants are in one of the most stable healthcare companies globally — a meaningful advantage over startup equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $220K with RSUs at $190K/4yr and a 22% bonus target. My senior engineering experience in [regulated software / biotech platforms / research informatics] makes me immediately effective at Genentech's senior level." Genentech will counter at $185K-$210K base with $100K-$160K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $300K. Push on bonus — it's the most flexible lever at Genentech.
