### Software Engineer | Genentech Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Roche Subsidiary / Bay Area Biotech Premium / RSU + Bonus / R&D-Driven Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| South San Francisco | $145K–$205K | $60K–$180K/4yr | 15–20% | $190K–$310K |
| Bay Area Remote | $140K–$195K | $55K–$170K/4yr | 15–20% | $180K–$295K |
| Other US | $130K–$185K | $50K–$155K/4yr | 15–20% | $165K–$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Genentech build technology that supports one of the world's most productive biotech R&D organizations. The role spans research informatics (LIMS, lab automation, data management), clinical trial technology (EDC, patient randomization, trial management), manufacturing systems (GxP-compliant automation), commercial platforms, and enterprise IT. Genentech's South San Francisco campus houses 10,000+ employees, and the engineering culture balances scientific rigor with modern software practices. As a Roche subsidiary, Genentech offers strong total compensation: competitive base salary, Roche RSUs (RHHBY stock), and generous bonus targets (15-20%) that significantly exceed health IT companies. Bay Area biotech comp is premium — Genentech competes with Big Tech, health tech, and biotech startups for software talent. The company's R&D culture means engineers work alongside PhD scientists, understanding biological context while building production software. [Source: Genentech Technology Careers 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Genentech SWE = Google L3-L4 = Meta E3-E4 = Illumina SWE (higher TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Bay Area Biotech Market Rate:** "Genentech competes for software talent in the Bay Area against Google, Meta, biotech startups, and health tech companies. My comp should reflect Bay Area biotech market rates, which include premium base salary and strong bonus targets."
2. **Biotech Bonus Advantage:** "Genentech's 15-20% bonus targets are significantly higher than typical tech company bonuses. Push for 20% — this is where Genentech's comp structure creates meaningful TC advantage."
3. **R&D Impact Frame:** "My engineering work supports drug discovery and clinical trials that generate billions in revenue. The software I build isn't a cost center — it accelerates the R&D pipeline that IS Genentech's business."
4. **GxP/Regulatory Complexity:** "I bring experience building software in regulated environments (GxP, FDA compliance, HIPAA). Biotech software engineering requires regulatory awareness that general software engineers lack."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $200K with RSUs at $160K/4yr and a 20% bonus target. My experience building [research informatics / clinical trial systems / regulated software] at [current company] maps directly to Genentech's technology needs." Genentech will counter at $165K-$185K base with $80K-$130K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $250K. Push hardest on bonus target — it's Genentech's most flexible lever.
