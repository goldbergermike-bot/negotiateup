| Other US | $145K–$205K | $65K–$180K/4yr | 15–25% | $195K–$325K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Genentech is the pioneer of the biotechnology industry — founded in 1976, it created the first recombinant DNA drug (human insulin) and the first biotech blockbuster (Herceptin). Now a subsidiary of Roche (the world's largest biotech company), Genentech operates with significant autonomy from its South San Francisco campus. The Computational Biology Engineer is Genentech's signature technical role — building computational tools, bioinformatics pipelines, and ML models that accelerate drug discovery and development. This role sits at the intersection of software engineering and biological science, requiring proficiency in both coding (Python, R, C++) and biological domains (genomics, proteomics, molecular biology, pharmacology). Genentech's R&D pipeline has 80+ molecules in development across oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and ophthalmology, and computational biology is increasingly driving target identification, biomarker discovery, patient stratification, and clinical trial optimization. Bay Area biotech comp is premium — Genentech pays significantly above health IT companies and competitively with Big Tech for specialized computational biology talent.

**Level Mapping:** Genentech Comp Bio Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML = Illumina Senior Comp Bio = Recursion Senior Scientist

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Computational Biology Engineer at Genentech works at the frontier of drug discovery:
- **80+ Molecule Pipeline:** Computational tools directly influence which drug candidates advance — your code affects which medicines reach patients
- **Multi-Omics Data:** Working with genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical data from world-class research teams
- **Pioneer Biotech Culture:** Genentech's campus in South San Francisco is the birthplace of biotech — the culture values scientific rigor and innovation
- **Roche Global Resources:** Access to Roche's global research network, clinical trial data, and manufacturing capabilities

**Global Levers**

1. **Bay Area Biotech Premium:** "South San Francisco is the global epicenter of biotech, and computational biology talent here competes with Google Health, Recursion, Insitro, and dozens of well-funded biotech startups. My comp should reflect Bay Area biotech market rates — not Roche global bands or health IT benchmarks."
2. **Pipeline Impact Quantification:** "My computational tools directly influence which drug candidates advance through Genentech's 80+ molecule pipeline. A successful drug generates billions in revenue. The R&D leverage of computational biology — identifying the right targets, stratifying the right patients — has enormous downstream financial impact."
3. **Rare Skill Intersection:** "Computational biology engineers who combine strong software engineering (production code, ML systems) with deep biological domain knowledge (genomics, molecular biology, pharmacology) are exceptionally rare. I'm not a biologist who codes or a coder who reads papers — I'm a true hybrid, and this dual expertise commands a premium."
4. **Bonus Target Maximization:** "Genentech's bonus targets range from 15-25% for senior technical roles. Given the strategic importance of computational biology to the R&D pipeline, I'm targeting 25%."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $220K with RSUs at $190K/4yr and a 25% bonus target. My computational biology experience — building [genomics pipelines / ML models for drug discovery / biomarker analysis tools] at [current company] — directly accelerates Genentech's R&D computational capabilities." Genentech will counter at $180K-$205K base with $100K-$160K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $300K. Push on bonus target — Genentech has strong bonus flexibility for R&D roles. **Floor: $280K TC minimum for Bay Area comp bio roles.**
