**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Genentech build the data infrastructure that powers drug discovery, clinical trials, and manufacturing — processing multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics), clinical trial data, real-world evidence (RWE), and manufacturing quality data. The role is uniquely complex because biotech data is diverse and domain-specific: FASTQ files, CDISC clinical trial standards, GxP-regulated manufacturing data, and unstructured research documents all flow through the data platform. Genentech's data engineers build ETL/ELT pipelines, data lakes, real-time streaming systems, and data quality frameworks using modern tools (Spark, Databricks, Snowflake, Airflow) while maintaining compliance with FDA data integrity requirements (21 CFR Part 11). Bay Area biotech comp for data engineers is premium — Genentech competes with Big Tech, health tech, and well-funded biotech startups. [Source: Genentech Data Platform Architecture 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Genentech Data Engineer = Google L3-L4 DE = Illumina DE = Moderna DE (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Omics Data Expertise:** "Biotech data engineering requires handling genomics (FASTQ, BAM, VCF), clinical (CDISC, SDTM, ADaM), and manufacturing (GxP) data standards. My experience with [specific biotech data types] eliminates the 6-12 month domain ramp."
2. **Bay Area Biotech Market Rate:** "Data engineers in the Bay Area biotech corridor command $200K-$320K TC. Genentech's offer should reflect this market reality."
3. **FDA Data Integrity Compliance:** "I bring experience building data pipelines in FDA-regulated environments (21 CFR Part 11). This regulatory data engineering expertise is rare and commands a premium."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "Genentech's 15-20% bonus targets are a major comp lever. I'm targeting 20% given my biotech data engineering expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with RSUs at $165K/4yr and a 20% bonus target. My biotech data engineering experience with [genomics / clinical / manufacturing data] at [current company] means I'm productive on Genentech's data platform from week one." Genentech will counter at $170K-$195K base with $85K-$140K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $260K. Push on bonus target.
