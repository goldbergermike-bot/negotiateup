**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Genentech are the highest IC technical leaders, setting architectural direction for technology platforms across the R&D, clinical, manufacturing, and commercial organizations. At this level, engineers influence decisions that span Genentech's South San Francisco campus and connect to Roche's global technology network. Staff engineers at Genentech combine deep technical expertise with scientific fluency — they can discuss platform architecture with engineering teams and data strategy with PhD scientists in the same meeting. Comp at the Staff level is exceptional: Bay Area biotech premium bases, substantial Roche RSU grants, and bonus targets of 20-28% create total comp that competes with Big Tech L5-L6 in the Bay Area. The stability of Roche's $60B+ revenue base means the equity component is less volatile than tech company RSUs. [Source: Genentech Staff Engineering Framework 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Genentech Staff SWE = Google L5-L6 = Microsoft Principal = Moderna Staff

**Global Levers**

1. **Big Tech Parity Frame:** "Staff engineers at Genentech should be compensated competitively with Google L5-L6 in the Bay Area. I'm bringing equivalent technical leadership scope to a company with Roche's $60B+ revenue stability."
2. **Cross-Organization Architecture:** "At the Staff level, my architectural decisions span R&D, clinical, manufacturing, and commercial — the entire drug lifecycle. This cross-organizational scope justifies top-of-band compensation."
3. **Bonus Target Maximization:** "Staff-level bonus targets at Genentech range from 20-28%. I'm targeting 28% given my [technical leadership scope / strategic architecture impact]. On a $240K base, the difference between 20% and 28% is $19K annually."
4. **Roche Global Platform Influence:** "Staff engineers at Genentech often influence Roche's global technology strategy. This global scope — affecting R&D operations in Basel, Tokyo, and beyond — justifies premium comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $250K with RSUs at $250K/4yr and a 28% bonus target. I'm bringing Staff-level technical leadership to Genentech's most critical platform decisions. My experience leading [enterprise platform architecture / biotech technology strategy] at [current company] makes me immediately impactful." Genentech will counter at $210K-$240K base with $140K-$220K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $370K. Push on bonus target — it's Genentech's most flexible lever at Staff level.
