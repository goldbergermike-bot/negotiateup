**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Genentech protect some of the most valuable intellectual property in the world — drug compound data, clinical trial results, manufacturing processes, and proprietary research. Pharmaceutical IP theft is a major national security concern, with state-sponsored actors actively targeting biotech R&D data. Genentech's security engineers must protect research data, clinical trial data (HIPAA + GxP), manufacturing systems, and enterprise IT across Genentech's South San Francisco campus and Roche's global network. The role requires understanding of pharma-specific regulatory security requirements (21 CFR Part 11, GxP computerized systems validation, HIPAA), research data classification, and the unique threat landscape facing biotech companies.

**Level Mapping:** Genentech Security = Google L4 Security = Moderna Security = Illumina Security (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **IP Protection Premium:** "Genentech's R&D data — drug compound data, clinical trial results, manufacturing processes — is worth billions. The IP protection mandate justifies premium security compensation."
2. **Bay Area Security Market:** "Security engineers in the Bay Area command $215K-$340K TC."
3. **Pharma Regulatory Security:** "I bring experience with FDA-regulated security (21 CFR Part 11, GxP validation, HIPAA). Pharma security has unique regulatory requirements beyond standard enterprise security."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "15-22% bonus. Targeting 22% given the critical nature of IP and clinical data protection."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $210K with RSUs at $175K/4yr and a 22% bonus. My pharma/biotech security experience with [IP protection / GxP security / clinical data HIPAA] at [current company] directly addresses Genentech's highest-priority security needs." Genentech will counter at $175K-$200K base with $90K-$150K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $280K. Push on bonus.
