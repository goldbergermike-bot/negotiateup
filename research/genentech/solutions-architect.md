**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Genentech design end-to-end technical architectures for the R&D, clinical, manufacturing, and commercial technology ecosystem. The role requires deep understanding of both enterprise architecture patterns and biotech-specific systems: LIMS (Laboratory Information Management), CTMS (Clinical Trial Management), MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems), EDC (Electronic Data Capture), and regulatory submission platforms. Solutions Architects must design systems that satisfy FDA validation requirements (GxP, 21 CFR Part 11), integrate with Roche's global technology landscape, and support the scientific workflows of PhD researchers. Architectures must balance innovation speed (R&D needs rapid iteration) with regulatory compliance (GxP requires validated, change-controlled systems).

**Level Mapping:** Genentech SA = Google L5 Solutions = Moderna SA = Veeva SA (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **R&D Architecture Strategic Impact:** "My architectural decisions shape the technology platforms supporting Genentech's 80+ molecule pipeline. Good architecture accelerates drug discovery; poor architecture creates bottlenecks that delay medicines reaching patients."
2. **Bay Area SA Market:** "Solutions architects in Bay Area biotech command $230K-$360K TC."
3. **GxP Architecture Expertise:** "Designing architectures that satisfy FDA GxP validation while enabling rapid R&D iteration is uniquely complex. I bring this regulatory architecture expertise."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "18-22% bonus. Targeting 22% for architectural leadership scope."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $220K with RSUs at $185K/4yr and a 22% bonus. My biotech solutions architecture experience — designing [LIMS / CTMS / GxP-validated platforms] — directly maps to Genentech's technology architecture needs." Genentech will counter at $180K-$210K base with $100K-$160K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $295K. Push on bonus.
