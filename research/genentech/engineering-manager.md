**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Genentech lead technology teams that support drug discovery, clinical development, manufacturing, and commercial operations. The role is uniquely challenging in biotech: EMs must manage teams of engineers while partnering with PhD scientists, understanding regulatory requirements, and navigating a culture that values scientific rigor above all. Genentech's EM comp is strong — Bay Area biotech premium bases, Roche RSU grants, and bonus targets of 20-28% that significantly exceed most tech companies. EMs at Genentech are evaluated on team delivery, talent retention, scientific partnership quality, and the ability to translate complex R&D requirements into engineering roadmaps. The Roche organizational matrix adds complexity — EMs often navigate both Genentech and Roche stakeholders. [Source: Genentech Engineering Leadership 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Genentech EM = Google L5-L6 EM = Moderna EM = Illumina EM (higher TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Bay Area EM Market:** "Engineering managers in Bay Area biotech command $270K-$400K TC. Genentech's offer needs to compete with Google, Recursion, and biotech startups."
2. **Bonus Target Maximization:** "Genentech EMs have bonus targets of 20-28%. I'm targeting 28% — the top of band. On a $230K base, the 8% difference is $18.4K annually."
3. **R&D Team Leadership Premium:** "Leading engineering teams in an R&D environment requires scientific fluency, regulatory awareness, and the ability to partner with PhD researchers. This specialized leadership commands a premium over standard tech EM roles."
4. **Retention Value in Biotech:** "Biotech engineering talent is scarce. Every engineer I retain saves Genentech $150K+ in recruiting costs plus 6-12 months of productivity loss."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $235K with RSUs at $220K/4yr and a 28% bonus target. My experience managing engineering teams in [biotech / regulated environments / R&D-adjacent technology] makes me effective from day one." Genentech will counter at $200K-$225K base with $120K-$190K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $330K. Push on bonus target — it's the strongest lever.
