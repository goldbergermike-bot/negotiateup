#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at CME Group build the machine learning infrastructure and models that sit at the frontier of financial AI. You design, train, and deploy models that leverage CME's unparalleled derivatives dataset — 6.4 billion contracts annually across CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and COMEX, spanning every major asset class with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Your models power market surveillance, risk analytics, pricing optimization, anomaly detection, and increasingly, the AI-driven products that CME's clients use to make trading decisions. At CME, ML/AI engineering is not a research experiment — it is production infrastructure that operates at exchange scale with exchange-grade reliability requirements.

The February 2026 pivot from "selling data" to "hydrating models" was designed around ML/AI Engineers. You are the engineers CME is building the model-hydration platform for — and also the engineers who build it. In this dual role, you both define what "high-fidelity" means for AI model consumption (what data formats, feature representations, temporal resolutions, and quality guarantees AI models need) and build the ML infrastructure that demonstrates the value of CME's High-Fidelity Data to external clients. ML/AI Engineers at CME now command a 15-20% premium under the "High-Fidelity Data" pay bands, reflecting the strategic centrality of this role. Under CEO Terry Duffy's technology-forward strategy, ML/AI engineering has become the fastest-growing engineering discipline at CME, with direct C-suite sponsorship and board-level visibility.

CME's public equity (NASDAQ: CME, ~$80B market cap) provides liquid, high-value RSU grants. The combination of CME's uniquely rich training data, exchange-scale production requirements, and strategic commitment to AI makes this one of the most compelling ML/AI engineering environments in financial technology — a point you should leverage in negotiations.

#### Model Hydration — The High-Fidelity Data Premium

- **The Feb 2026 Strategic Shift:** In February 2026, CME Group formally transitioned from traditional data licensing to "hydrating models" — delivering high-fidelity, ML-optimized data feeds for AI model training and real-time inference. ML/AI Engineers are at the epicenter of this shift: they define the model-hydration data specifications, build the demonstration models that prove CME's data value, and architect the ML infrastructure that powers the platform. ML/AI Engineers working on model-hydration see total comp packages $41K-$80K above standard ML engineering bands.

- **High-Fidelity Data Pay Bands:** CME has created premium "High-Fidelity Data" pay bands for ML/AI Engineers working on model-hydration infrastructure and demonstration models. At the ML/AI Engineer level, this translates to a 15-20% premium — pushing the Chicago ceiling from $398K to approximately $458K-$478K for engineers with demonstrated expertise in financial ML, real-time inference systems, or ML infrastructure at scale.

- **Why CME's Data Is Uniquely Valuable:** CME's derivatives data — real-time options pricing, implied and realized volatility surfaces, order book microstructure at sub-millisecond resolution, trade flow analytics, and Greeks across every major asset class — is the highest-fidelity financial dataset available for AI model training. No synthetic data can replicate the complexity and information density of CME's live derivatives markets. ML/AI Engineers who build models and infrastructure on top of this data are working with training data that competitors cannot obtain or reproduce.

- **Frame Yourself as the Model-Hydration ML Architect:** In negotiations, position yourself as "the ML engineer who both defines what high-fidelity data means for AI models and builds the infrastructure that proves CME's data creates superior models." This dual framing — domain expert and infrastructure builder — is unique to CME's model-hydration initiative and commands the maximum High-Fidelity Data premium. Emphasize experience with financial ML, real-time inference, feature engineering at scale, or ML platform architecture.

#### Global Levers

**1. Financial ML & Derivatives Modeling Experience — $30K-$55K Lever**
Experience building ML models on financial data, especially derivatives. Script: *"I've built production ML models for [derivatives pricing / volatility forecasting / risk modeling / market microstructure] processing [X] events per second. This is the exact domain CME's model-hydration initiative targets. I expect the High-Fidelity Data ML premium — targeting $380K-$430K total comp."*

**2. ML Infrastructure & Platform Architecture — $25K-$45K Lever**
Experience building ML platforms, feature stores, or inference systems at scale. Script: *"I've architected ML infrastructure supporting [X] models in production with [X]ms p99 inference latency. CME's model-hydration platform requires exactly this kind of ML infrastructure expertise. I'd like the comp to reflect the platform-architecture premium."*

**3. Competing Offers from Quant Firms / AI Companies — $25K-$50K Lever**
ML/AI Engineers are the most contested talent pool in technology. Script: *"I have competing offers from [quant firm / AI company] at $[X]K total comp. CME's model-hydration initiative offers a unique combination of the world's best financial training data and exchange-scale production requirements, but I need the package to be competitive with my alternatives."*

**4. Published ML Research & Patents — $15K-$30K Lever**
Published work in financial ML, time-series modeling, or real-time inference. Script: *"My published research in [topic] with [X] citations demonstrates thought leadership in the exact domain CME's model-hydration strategy targets. I'd like the comp to reflect the intellectual capital and reputation I bring."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $385K total comp (Chicago) to land at $355K-$398K. Open with: *"Based on CME's High-Fidelity Data ML bands and my experience building [financial ML models / ML infrastructure], I'm targeting $385K total comp, structured as $245K base, $90K RSU/4yr, and $50K bonus."* If countered below $310K, respond: *"ML/AI Engineers with production financial-ML experience are the scarcest talent in the market. Given my [specific experience] and competing offers, $315K is my absolute walk-away floor."* For New York, anchor at $415K; walk-away at $335K. For London, anchor at £298K / $375K; walk-away at £240K / $302K. Push for a $40K-$65K signing bonus and a guaranteed annual RSU refresh of $30K-$50K.
