#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at CME Group build and maintain the data infrastructure that processes, transforms, stores, and delivers the world's most comprehensive derivatives dataset. CME's four exchanges — CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and COMEX — generate massive volumes of market data from 6.4 billion annual contracts representing roughly $1 quadrillion in notional value. You build the pipelines that ingest tick-level trade data, order book snapshots, settlement prices, volatility surfaces, and Greeks, and you ensure this data flows reliably to internal analytics systems, client-facing feeds, and CME's $600M+ annual market data business. At CME, data engineering is not a support function — it is the foundation of the company's highest-margin revenue stream.

The February 2026 strategic pivot from "selling data" to "hydrating models" made Data Engineers the single most critical engineering function at CME Group. You are building the core pipeline infrastructure that transforms CME's raw derivatives data into High-Fidelity Data feeds — optimized for AI/ML model training and real-time inference. This requires designing streaming architectures that preserve sub-millisecond temporal fidelity, building transformation layers that convert raw exchange data into ML-consumable feature formats, and creating quality assurance systems that guarantee data completeness and accuracy at production scale. Data Engineers on model-hydration pipelines command a 15-20% premium under CME's "High-Fidelity Data" pay bands — the largest premium for any non-ML engineering role — because they are building the literal plumbing of CME's strategic future.

CEO Terry Duffy's technology-forward strategy has positioned data engineering as a top-tier engineering discipline at CME, with dedicated headcount growth and compensation budget. Your RSU grants in CME's liquid public equity (NASDAQ: CME) offer strong upside in a company whose revenue growth is increasingly driven by the data infrastructure you build.

#### Model Hydration — The High-Fidelity Data Premium

- **The Feb 2026 Strategic Shift:** In February 2026, CME Group officially transitioned from traditional market data licensing to "hydrating models" — building high-fidelity data pipelines that deliver ML-optimized derivatives data for AI model training and real-time inference. Data Engineers are the primary builders of these pipelines. Those working on model-hydration data infrastructure see total comp packages $30K-$58K above standard data engineering bands.

- **High-Fidelity Data Pay Bands:** CME has established dedicated "High-Fidelity Data" pay bands for Data Engineers building model-hydration pipelines. At the Data Engineer level, this translates to a 15-20% premium — pushing the Chicago ceiling from $288K to approximately $331K-$346K for engineers with demonstrated experience in streaming data architectures, ML feature pipelines, or high-throughput data transformation systems.

- **Why CME's Data Is Uniquely Valuable:** CME's derivatives data — real-time options pricing across every major asset class, implied and realized volatility surfaces, order book microstructure at sub-millisecond granularity, trade flow analytics, and Greeks — is the richest dataset in quantitative finance. Data Engineers who build the pipelines that preserve the temporal fidelity and signal integrity of this data through transformation into AI-consumable formats are creating the most valuable data infrastructure in the financial industry.

- **Frame Yourself as the Model-Hydration Pipeline Builder:** In negotiations, position yourself as "the engineer who builds the pipelines that transform CME's raw derivatives data into the high-fidelity feeds that hydrate AI models." This is the most direct framing for the High-Fidelity Data premium. Emphasize experience with Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Spark Streaming, dbt, or similar streaming/batch data processing frameworks. Reference specific throughput numbers and data quality guarantees you have achieved.

#### Global Levers

**1. Streaming Data Pipeline & ML Feature Engineering — $20K-$38K Lever**
Experience building streaming data pipelines or ML feature stores is the strongest lever. Script: *"I've built streaming data pipelines processing [X] TB/day at [sub-second latency] for [specific ML/analytics use case]. This maps directly to CME's model-hydration pipeline architecture. I expect the High-Fidelity Data premium — targeting $270K-$300K total comp."*

**2. Financial Market Data Infrastructure — $15K-$28K Lever**
Experience with exchange market data, FIX feeds, or financial data infrastructure. Script: *"My experience building data infrastructure for [exchange / market data provider / trading firm] gives me deep understanding of the unique data quality and latency requirements of financial market data. CME's model-hydration pipelines demand exactly this expertise. I'd like the comp to reflect that specialization."*

**3. Competing Offers from Data-Intensive Companies — $15K-$25K Lever**
Data engineering talent is heavily recruited by tech companies and trading firms. Script: *"I have a competing offer from [company] at $[X]K total comp. CME's model-hydration data pipeline challenge is uniquely compelling — the data is richer and the stakes are higher than anywhere else — but I need the package to be competitive."*

**4. Data Quality & Governance Experience — $10K-$18K Lever**
Data quality assurance at production scale is critical for model-hydration pipelines. Script: *"I've implemented data quality frameworks that achieved [X]% data completeness and [X]ms data freshness SLAs at [company]. For CME's model-hydration pipelines, data integrity is non-negotiable — AI models trained on incomplete or corrupted data produce catastrophic results. I'd like the comp to reflect this data quality expertise."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $275K total comp (Chicago) to land at $252K-$288K. Open with: *"Based on CME's High-Fidelity Data bands for Data Engineers and my experience building [streaming pipeline / ML feature infrastructure], I'm targeting $275K total comp, structured as $182K base, $60K RSU/4yr, and $33K bonus."* If countered below $228K, respond: *"Given that Data Engineers building model-hydration pipelines are the highest-priority engineering hire at CME right now, and my [specific pipeline experience], $230K is my walk-away floor."* For New York, anchor at $298K; walk-away at $248K. For London, anchor at £214K / $269K; walk-away at £176K / $221K. Push for a $20K-$35K signing bonus.
