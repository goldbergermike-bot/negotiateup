#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at CME Group orchestrate the delivery of complex, cross-functional technology programs that underpin the world's largest derivatives marketplace. You coordinate across engineering, product, operations, compliance, and business teams to deliver programs that affect 6.4 billion annual contracts across CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and COMEX. At CME, programs are not internal-only — they carry regulatory implications (CFTC, SEC, FCA), market-integrity requirements, and client-facing delivery timelines that make execution failure unacceptable. TPMs at CME operate under constraints that few other technology organizations face: zero tolerance for market disruption, multi-regulator coordination, and the need to maintain $1 quadrillion in notional value flowing through the system during every change.

The February 2026 pivot from "selling data" to "hydrating models" created the most ambitious cross-functional program at CME Group. The model-hydration initiative spans data engineering, ML infrastructure, market data operations, client integration, legal/compliance, and commercial teams — all coordinated by Technical Program Managers. TPMs who lead model-hydration programs command a 15-20% premium under CME's "High-Fidelity Data" pay bands because they orchestrate the delivery of CME's most strategically important initiative across an unprecedented number of stakeholders.

CEO Terry Duffy's technology-forward strategy has elevated TPMs within CME's organizational hierarchy. Model-hydration TPMs report into the CTO organization with direct visibility to the executive committee. Your RSU grants in CME's liquid public equity (NASDAQ: CME) provide meaningful upside, and the high-visibility nature of model-hydration programs creates clear paths to Director and VP-level program leadership.

#### Model Hydration — The High-Fidelity Data Premium

- **The Feb 2026 Strategic Shift:** In February 2026, CME Group formally transitioned from traditional data licensing to "hydrating models" — delivering high-fidelity, ML-optimized data feeds for AI model training. Technical Program Managers orchestrate the cross-functional delivery of this initiative, coordinating engineering, data operations, client integration, compliance, and commercial teams. TPMs leading model-hydration programs see total comp packages $29K-$56K above standard TPM bands.

- **High-Fidelity Data Pay Bands:** CME has created "High-Fidelity Data" pay bands for TPMs who lead model-hydration program delivery. At the TPM level, this translates to a 15-20% premium — pushing the Chicago ceiling from $282K to approximately $324K-$338K for TPMs with demonstrated experience managing ML-platform delivery, data-infrastructure programs, or complex cross-functional technology initiatives in regulated environments.

- **Why CME's Data Is Uniquely Valuable:** CME's derivatives data — options pricing, volatility surfaces, order flow, and Greeks across every major asset class — requires a complex, multi-stakeholder delivery program to transform into AI-consumable feeds. The model-hydration program spans data engineering, ML infrastructure, market data operations, regulatory compliance, and commercial go-to-market — a scope that demands exceptional program management. TPMs who can coordinate this breadth of stakeholders are essential to CME's strategic success.

- **Frame Yourself as the Model-Hydration Program Orchestrator:** In negotiations, position yourself as "the program leader who orchestrates the end-to-end delivery of CME's model-hydration initiative across engineering, data operations, compliance, and commercial teams." Emphasize experience managing complex, multi-stakeholder technology programs in regulated environments. This framing connects your program management expertise to CME's Feb 2026 strategic pivot.

#### Global Levers

**1. ML-Platform / Data-Infrastructure Program Delivery — $18K-$35K Lever**
Experience delivering complex ML-platform or data-infrastructure programs. Script: *"I've led the delivery of [specific ML platform / data infrastructure program] coordinating [X] teams across [engineering, data, compliance, etc.]. This cross-functional orchestration experience maps directly to CME's model-hydration program needs. I expect the High-Fidelity Data TPM premium — targeting $265K-$295K total comp."*

**2. Regulated-Environment Program Management — $12K-$25K Lever**
TPM experience in financial services, healthcare, or other regulated environments. Script: *"I've managed program delivery in [regulated industry] with [specific regulator] coordination requirements. CME's CFTC/SEC/FCA regulatory environment requires exactly this kind of compliance-aware program management. I'd like the comp to reflect this regulated-environment expertise."*

**3. Competing TPM Offers — $12K-$22K Lever**
Technical Program Managers with financial infrastructure experience are scarce. Script: *"I have a competing TPM offer from [company] at $[X]K total comp. CME's model-hydration program is the most compelling cross-functional delivery challenge I've seen, but I need the package to be competitive."*

**4. Scale & Complexity Track Record — $10K-$20K Lever**
Demonstrated ability to manage programs at exchange scale. Script: *"I've delivered programs affecting [X] daily transactions / [X] teams / $[X]M in budget. CME's model-hydration initiative operates at similar scale with higher stakes. I'd like the comp to reflect the complexity and consequence of this program."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $270K total comp (Chicago) to land at $248K-$282K. Open with: *"Based on CME's High-Fidelity Data TPM bands and my track record delivering [ML-platform / data-infrastructure programs], I'm targeting $270K total comp, structured as $178K base, $58K RSU/4yr, and $34K bonus."* If countered below $225K, respond: *"Given the strategic scope of the model-hydration program and my regulated-environment delivery experience, $228K is my walk-away floor."* For New York, anchor at $292K; walk-away at $242K. For London, anchor at £210K / $264K; walk-away at £172K / $216K. Push for a $18K-$32K signing bonus.
