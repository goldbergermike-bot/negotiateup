#### Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at CME Group shape the user experience of the world's largest derivatives marketplace. You design the interfaces, data visualizations, and workflows that traders, risk managers, and quantitative analysts use to interact with markets that process 6.4 billion contracts and roughly $1 quadrillion in notional value annually. CME's platforms span CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and COMEX — each with distinct user populations and information density requirements. Financial UX at this scale demands expertise in complex data visualization, high-density information architecture, and real-time interface design that can convey market state at a glance.

The February 2026 shift from "selling data" to "hydrating models" created a new design domain at CME Group. Product Designers are now responsible for designing the developer experience, API documentation interfaces, data catalog UX, and visualization dashboards that help AI/ML engineers discover, evaluate, and integrate CME's High-Fidelity Data feeds into their model training pipelines. This is a fundamentally different design challenge than traditional exchange UI — it requires understanding how data scientists and ML engineers consume data, what makes a data product discoverable, and how to visualize data quality and coverage in intuitive ways. CME has created "High-Fidelity Data" pay bands that provide a 15-20% premium for designers working on model-hydration experiences.

Under CEO Terry Duffy's technology-forward strategy, design has gained significant organizational influence at CME. Product Designers working on model-hydration products collaborate directly with data engineers, ML engineers, and product managers to shape the experience layer of CME's most strategic initiative. Your RSU grants in CME's liquid public equity (NASDAQ: CME) offer meaningful upside in a consistently profitable company.

#### Model Hydration — The High-Fidelity Data Premium

- **The Feb 2026 Strategic Shift:** In February 2026, CME Group transitioned from traditional data licensing to "hydrating models" — delivering high-fidelity, ML-optimized data feeds for AI model training. Product Designers working on model-hydration experiences design the interfaces through which hundreds of AI/ML teams discover and consume CME's data. Designers on High-Fidelity Data products see total comp packages $24K-$46K above standard design bands.

- **High-Fidelity Data Pay Bands:** CME's "High-Fidelity Data" pay bands provide a 15-20% premium for designers working on model-hydration product experiences. At the Product Designer level, this pushes the Chicago ceiling from $232K to approximately $267K-$278K for designers with demonstrated experience in data product UX, developer experience design, or complex data visualization.

- **Why CME's Data Is Uniquely Valuable:** CME's derivatives data — options pricing, volatility surfaces, order book depth, trade flow, and Greeks — requires sophisticated visualization and interaction design to make it accessible to AI/ML consumers. Designers who can create intuitive data discovery experiences, quality dashboards, and integration workflows for this uniquely complex dataset are building the experience layer of CME's most strategically important product.

- **Frame Yourself as the Model-Hydration Experience Designer:** In negotiations, position yourself as "the designer who makes CME's high-fidelity derivatives data discoverable and usable for AI/ML teams." Emphasize experience with data product UX, developer portals, API documentation design, or complex data visualization. This framing connects your design skills to CME's Feb 2026 strategic shift.

#### Global Levers

**1. Data Product & Developer Experience Design — $15K-$30K Lever**
Experience designing data products, developer portals, or API experiences is the strongest lever. Script: *"I've designed the developer experience for [specific data product / API platform] serving [X] developers. This maps directly to CME's model-hydration product UX needs. I expect my comp to reflect the High-Fidelity Data design premium — targeting $215K-$245K total comp."*

**2. Complex Financial Data Visualization — $10K-$20K Lever**
Financial UX expertise is rare among designers. Script: *"My experience designing [trading interfaces / financial dashboards / data visualization systems] gives me deep fluency in high-density information design. At CME's scale — 6.4 billion contracts across four exchanges — this financial UX expertise is directly applicable and scarce. I'd like the comp to reflect that specialization."*

**3. Competing Design Offers from Fintech — $10K-$20K Lever**
Design talent with financial domain experience is heavily recruited. Script: *"I have a competing offer from [Bloomberg / Stripe / fintech company] at $[X]K total comp. CME's model-hydration design challenge is uniquely compelling, but I need the package to be competitive."*

**4. Design Systems & Scalable UX Infrastructure — $8K-$15K Lever**
Experience building design systems that scale across multiple products. Script: *"I've built and maintained design systems serving [X] products and [X] engineers. CME's four exchanges and expanding model-hydration product line need scalable design infrastructure. I'd like the comp to reflect the platform value of this design-systems expertise."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $220K total comp (Chicago) to land at $200K-$232K. Open with: *"Based on CME's High-Fidelity Data design bands and my experience designing [data product / developer experience], I'm targeting $220K total comp, structured as $148K base, $45K RSU/4yr, and $27K bonus."* If countered below $185K, respond: *"Given the specialized nature of data product design and my [specific financial UX experience], $188K is my walk-away floor."* For New York, anchor at $238K; walk-away at $200K. For London, anchor at £170K / $214K; walk-away at £142K / $179K. Push for a $15K-$25K signing bonus.
