#### Negotiation DNA

An Engineering Manager at CME Group leads the teams that build and operate the infrastructure powering the world's largest derivatives marketplace. You are responsible for the delivery, reliability, and performance of systems that process 6.4 billion contracts annually across CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and COMEX — roughly $1 quadrillion in notional value. Your leadership directly impacts CME's ability to maintain its dominant market position and its $600M+ annual market data revenue stream. At this level, you own headcount planning, hiring, team performance, technical roadmap execution, and cross-functional collaboration with product and business stakeholders.

The February 2026 strategic shift from "selling data" to "hydrating models" has fundamentally changed what CME expects from Engineering Managers. You are now expected to build and lead teams that operate at the intersection of traditional exchange infrastructure and AI/ML data platforms. The model-hydration initiative requires Engineering Managers who can recruit engineers with both low-latency systems expertise and data-pipeline skills, set team direction toward High-Fidelity Data objectives, and deliver against an aggressive roadmap to transform CME's derivatives data into AI-consumable feeds. Managers who lead model-hydration teams command a 15-20% compensation premium under CME's "High-Fidelity Data" pay bands.

CEO Terry Duffy's technology-forward strategy has elevated engineering leadership within CME's organizational hierarchy. Engineering Managers now report closer to the C-suite, have larger headcount budgets, and wield greater influence over strategic technology decisions. CME's public equity structure (NASDAQ: CME) ensures your RSU grants carry liquid, high-value upside in one of the most consistently profitable financial infrastructure companies globally.

#### Model Hydration — The High-Fidelity Data Premium

- **The Feb 2026 Strategic Shift:** In February 2026, CME Group pivoted from traditional data licensing to "hydrating models" — building high-fidelity, ML-optimized data pipelines that feed AI model training and real-time inference. Engineering Managers who lead model-hydration teams are at the center of this transformation. Those who manage High-Fidelity Data teams see total comp packages $41K-$80K above standard engineering management bands.

- **High-Fidelity Data Pay Bands:** CME has established premium "High-Fidelity Data" pay bands for managers who build and lead model-hydration engineering teams. At the Engineering Manager level, this translates to a 15-20% premium — pushing the Chicago ceiling from $398K to approximately $458K-$478K for managers with demonstrated experience leading ML-infrastructure or data-platform teams.

- **Why CME's Data Is Uniquely Valuable:** CME's derivatives data — spanning options pricing, volatility surfaces, order book depth, trade flow, and Greeks across every major asset class — is the most information-rich financial dataset on earth. Engineering Managers who build teams that transform this data into AI-consumable formats are leading the most strategically important engineering effort at CME. Your ability to recruit, retain, and develop engineers who can bridge exchange infrastructure and ML data engineering is a critical competitive advantage.

- **Frame Yourself as the Model-Hydration Team Builder:** In negotiations, position yourself as "the leader who builds and scales the engineering teams that power CME's model-hydration platform." Emphasize your ability to recruit engineers with the rare combination of exchange-infrastructure and AI-pipeline skills, and your track record of delivering complex data-platform projects. This framing unlocks the High-Fidelity Data management premium.

#### Global Levers

**1. Model-Hydration Team Leadership Experience — $30K-$55K Lever**
If you have led teams building ML data platforms or streaming data infrastructure, this is your strongest lever. Script: *"I've built and led a team of [X] engineers delivering [specific ML data platform], growing the team from [X] to [Y] while shipping on schedule. This experience maps directly to CME's model-hydration team-building needs. I expect my compensation to reflect the High-Fidelity Data management premium — targeting $380K-$420K total comp."*

**2. Headcount Growth & Team-Scaling Track Record — $20K-$35K Lever**
CME is actively expanding engineering headcount for model-hydration work. Script: *"I've scaled engineering teams from [X] to [Y] engineers in [timeframe], maintaining velocity and quality throughout. At CME's growth stage for the model-hydration initiative, this team-scaling expertise is directly valuable. I'd like the comp to reflect the management premium for high-growth teams."*

**3. Competing Management Offers — $25K-$40K Lever**
Engineering management talent in financial infrastructure is scarce. Script: *"I have a competing Engineering Manager offer from [company] at $[X]K total comp. I'm drawn to CME's model-hydration mission and the engineering leadership opportunity, but I need the package to be competitive. Can we enhance the RSU component or add a signing bonus to close the gap?"*

**4. Retention & Team Stability Premium — $15K-$30K Lever**
Engineering Manager attrition is costly — your departure risks losing the entire team. Script: *"Given that Engineering Manager transitions typically create 6-9 months of team disruption, I'd like to discuss retention-oriented compensation: a guaranteed annual RSU refresh of $30K-$50K and a retention bonus at the 2-year mark. This aligns CME's stability interests with my long-term commitment."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $380K total comp (Chicago) to land at $340K-$398K. Open with: *"Based on CME's High-Fidelity Data management bands and my track record scaling engineering teams that deliver [specific ML/data platform], I'm targeting $380K total comp, structured as $235K base, $95K RSU/4yr, and $50K bonus."* If countered below $310K, respond: *"Given the strategic importance of building model-hydration teams and my demonstrated ability to recruit and retain the engineers CME needs, $315K is my walk-away floor."* For New York, anchor at $410K; walk-away at $335K. For London, anchor at £295K / $371K; walk-away at £245K / $308K. Push for a $35K-$55K signing bonus and guaranteed RSU refresh.
