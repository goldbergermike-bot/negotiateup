#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at CME Group work with the most comprehensive derivatives dataset on the planet. You analyze patterns in 6.4 billion annual contracts across CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and COMEX — spanning futures, options, swaps, and OTC products across every major asset class. Your work directly informs CME's product strategy, market surveillance, risk management, and the pricing of CME's $600M+ annual market data business. At CME, data science is not an auxiliary function — it is core to how the company understands, prices, and monetizes its markets.

The February 2026 pivot from "selling data" to "hydrating models" positioned Data Scientists at the center of CME's most strategic initiative. You are now responsible for defining what makes CME's data "high-fidelity" for AI/ML consumption — identifying which features of derivatives data (volatility surfaces, order flow patterns, Greeks dynamics, market microstructure signals) are most valuable for model training, and working with data engineers to build the transformation pipelines that deliver these features at production quality. This is where deep quantitative finance expertise meets modern ML engineering, and it is the reason CME created "High-Fidelity Data" pay bands with a 15-20% premium for Data Scientists working on model-hydration initiatives.

CEO Terry Duffy's technology-forward strategy has elevated data science within CME's organizational hierarchy. Data Scientists on model-hydration projects now collaborate directly with CME's Chief Data Officer and Chief Technology Officer, and their work directly shapes the company's fastest-growing revenue stream. Your RSU grants in CME's liquid public equity (NASDAQ: CME) provide meaningful upside in a company with robust revenue growth and strong free cash flow.

#### Model Hydration — The High-Fidelity Data Premium

- **The Feb 2026 Strategic Shift:** In February 2026, CME Group formally pivoted from traditional data licensing to "hydrating models" — transforming its raw derivatives market data into high-fidelity, ML-optimized feeds for AI model training and real-time inference. Data Scientists are the domain experts who define what "high-fidelity" means — which features of CME's data are most valuable for AI models, how to measure data quality, and how to validate that model-hydration pipelines preserve signal integrity. Data Scientists on model-hydration projects see total comp packages $31K-$60K above standard data science bands.

- **High-Fidelity Data Pay Bands:** CME has established "High-Fidelity Data" pay bands for Data Scientists working on model-hydration projects. At the Data Scientist level, this translates to a 15-20% premium — pushing the Chicago ceiling from $298K to approximately $343K-$358K for scientists with demonstrated expertise in derivatives analytics, feature engineering for ML, or market microstructure research.

- **Why CME's Data Is Uniquely Valuable:** CME's derivatives data encompasses real-time options pricing, implied and realized volatility surfaces, order book microstructure at sub-millisecond granularity, trade flow analytics, and Greeks across every major asset class. This is the richest dataset in quantitative finance for training AI models on market dynamics. Data Scientists who can extract, validate, and engineer features from this data for ML consumption are building the intellectual foundation of CME's model-hydration business.

- **Frame Yourself as the High-Fidelity Data Quality Authority:** In negotiations, position yourself as "the scientist who defines what high-fidelity means for CME's model-hydration data" — the domain expert who ensures that CME's derivatives data retains its signal integrity through the transformation pipeline. This framing connects your quantitative expertise to CME's Feb 2026 strategic shift and unlocks the premium.

#### Global Levers

**1. Derivatives / Quantitative Finance Expertise — $20K-$40K Lever**
Deep knowledge of derivatives pricing, volatility modeling, or market microstructure is the strongest lever. Script: *"My expertise in [derivatives pricing / volatility surface modeling / market microstructure] directly applies to defining what makes CME's data high-fidelity for AI model training. I understand the Feb 2026 shift to model hydration, and I can define the feature engineering strategy that maximizes the value of CME's derivatives data. I expect the High-Fidelity Data premium — targeting $275K-$310K total comp."*

**2. ML Feature Engineering & Pipeline Experience — $15K-$30K Lever**
Experience building ML feature pipelines from financial data. Script: *"I've designed feature engineering pipelines that transform [raw financial data] into ML-consumable features serving [X] models in production. This is exactly the transformation layer CME needs for model hydration. I'd like the comp to reflect this combination of domain expertise and ML engineering skill."*

**3. Competing Offers from Quant Firms / Hedge Funds — $20K-$35K Lever**
Quantitative firms in Chicago and New York aggressively recruit data scientists with financial domain expertise. Script: *"I have a competing offer from [quant firm / hedge fund] at $[X]K total comp. CME's model-hydration initiative offers a unique opportunity to define the data standard for AI in derivatives markets, but I need the package to be competitive."*

**4. Research Publication & Domain Authority — $10K-$20K Lever**
Published research in derivatives analytics, market microstructure, or financial ML. Script: *"My published research in [topic] has been cited [X] times and demonstrates domain authority in exactly the area CME's model-hydration strategy targets. I'd like the comp to reflect the intellectual capital I bring to defining CME's high-fidelity data standards."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $285K total comp (Chicago) to land at $260K-$298K. Open with: *"Based on CME's High-Fidelity Data bands for Data Scientists and my expertise in [derivatives analytics / feature engineering], I'm targeting $285K total comp, structured as $185K base, $65K RSU/4yr, and $35K bonus."* If countered below $235K, respond: *"Given my domain expertise in [specific area] and the premium CME places on scientists who can define high-fidelity data standards, $240K is my walk-away floor."* For New York, anchor at $308K; walk-away at $255K. For London, anchor at £220K / $277K; walk-away at £182K / $229K. Push for a $20K-$35K signing bonus.
