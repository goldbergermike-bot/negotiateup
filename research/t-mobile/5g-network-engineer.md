**Negotiation DNA**

The 5G Network Engineer is T-Mobile's signature technical role — building and optimizing the largest 5G network in the United States. T-Mobile's $250B market cap is built on its 5G leadership, having won the race to deploy nationwide 5G through strategic Sprint spectrum acquisition and aggressive network buildout. You are designing, deploying, and optimizing the 5G radio access network (RAN), core network architecture, and network automation systems that serve 120M+ postpaid customers and power T-Mobile's next-generation services including fixed wireless access (FWA), IoT, edge computing, and enterprise solutions.

This role commands a 15-20% 5G premium over standard T-Mobile engineering compensation because 5G network engineers require specialized expertise in mmWave/mid-band/low-band spectrum deployment, O-RAN architecture, network slicing, and RAN optimization — skills that are in extremely high demand as every carrier and equipment vendor competes for the same talent pool.

**Level Mapping:** T-Mobile 5G Network Engineer (Senior) = Ericsson Senior RAN Engineer = Nokia Senior Network Architect = Qualcomm Senior Systems Engineer = Verizon Senior Network Engineer

**T-Mobile 5G Leadership Premium**

T-Mobile's 5G leadership is not just marketing — it represents the most valuable spectrum portfolio and largest deployed 5G network in the US. The Sprint acquisition gave T-Mobile unmatched mid-band (2.5 GHz) spectrum holdings that enable the best balance of coverage and capacity in the industry. 5G Network Engineers at T-Mobile are building on this spectrum advantage to deliver services that competitors cannot match: faster average 5G speeds, broader 5G coverage, and more spectrum-efficient network design. The company's fixed wireless access (FWA) business — enabled by 5G — has become a major growth vector, adding millions of broadband customers and disrupting traditional cable providers.

**Global Levers**

1. **Signature Role — 5G Network Leadership:** "I'm building the largest 5G network in America — the infrastructure that underpins T-Mobile's $250B market cap. 5G is not a feature; it's T-Mobile's entire competitive strategy. The network quality I deliver determines subscriber growth, FWA expansion, and enterprise revenue. This signature role warrants premium 5G compensation."

2. **5G Talent Scarcity Premium:** "Engineers with 5G RAN, network core, and optimization expertise are among the most sought-after in telecom. Ericsson, Nokia, Qualcomm, Samsung, and every major carrier compete for this talent with $250K-$400K+ packages. T-Mobile's offer should include the 5G premium to attract from this pool — I'd like RSUs of $[X]K."

3. **Spectrum Advantage Execution:** "T-Mobile's mid-band spectrum advantage is only valuable if the network is engineered to exploit it. I bring expertise in [spectrum optimization/RAN deployment/network architecture] that directly maximizes the ROI on T-Mobile's spectrum investments worth tens of billions."

4. **FWA Revenue Engine:** "T-Mobile's fixed wireless access business — powered by 5G — is disrupting cable broadband and growing rapidly. The 5G network quality I engineer directly determines FWA capacity, coverage, and customer experience. Every FWA subscriber I enable generates recurring broadband revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building T-Mobile's 5G network — the combination of the best spectrum portfolio, largest deployed network, and aggressive innovation agenda is the most compelling 5G opportunity in the industry. I hold a competing offer from [Ericsson/Qualcomm/Verizon] at $[X]K total comp. To make T-Mobile competitive: $[205K] base, $[175K] RSUs over four years, and a $[30K] signing bonus. At $[310-345]K, this reflects the 5G talent premium and the signature nature of this role. T-Mobile's 5G future depends on engineers like me — let's align."
