### DevOps Engineer | T-Mobile Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $250B 5G Leader | Network + Platform Infrastructure | 5G-Scale Reliability

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Bellevue / Seattle | $130K–$185K | $48K–$148K | 10-15% | $165K–$268K |
| NYC / San Francisco | $135K–$190K | $52K–$155K | 10-15% | $175K–$280K |
| Dallas / Denver | $122K–$175K | $40K–$132K | 10-15% | $150K–$248K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at T-Mobile ensure the reliability and performance of infrastructure supporting the nation's largest 5G network and 120M+ customers. T-Mobile's infrastructure spans network operations systems, consumer-facing platforms (T-Mobile app, account management), 5G service delivery infrastructure, and enterprise solutions — all requiring 24/7 reliability and rapid deployment capabilities. When T-Mobile's customer-facing systems go down, 120M+ customers are affected; when network management systems fail, 5G service quality degrades across the country.

T-Mobile's DevOps transformation is advanced relative to telecom peers — the company has embraced cloud-native architectures, Kubernetes at scale, infrastructure-as-code, and CI/CD pipelines that enable rapid feature delivery. This modern approach to infrastructure, driven by T-Mobile's tech-forward culture, creates a more appealing DevOps environment than traditional telecom companies.

**Level Mapping:** T-Mobile DevOps Engineer (L4-L6) = Google L3-L5 SRE = Amazon SDE II-III (Infrastructure) = Microsoft 60-63

**T-Mobile Infrastructure Premium**

T-Mobile's infrastructure challenge is uniquely demanding: supporting both telecommunications network operations (cell towers, spectrum management, network core) and modern cloud-native software platforms (consumer apps, 5G APIs, enterprise services). DevOps Engineers who can ensure reliability across this spectrum bring a rare dual expertise that is valued at both T-Mobile and in the broader market.

**Global Levers**

1. **5G-Scale Reliability:** "T-Mobile's 5G network serves 120M+ customers — infrastructure failures at this scale are measured in millions of dollars per hour and brand damage. My reliability track record of [X]% uptime at [company] directly protects T-Mobile's subscriber base. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Telecom + Cloud Hybrid Expertise:** "T-Mobile's infrastructure spans telecom network operations and cloud-native platforms. DevOps engineers with both expertise are rare. My experience with [cloud + telecom infrastructure] is exactly this dual skill set. RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Seattle Market Competition:** "I have a competing offer from [AWS/Microsoft/Google] at $[X]K in the Seattle market. T-Mobile's infrastructure challenge is more complex and more compelling, but the compensation needs to be locally competitive."

4. **Platform Modernization Value:** "T-Mobile's ongoing cloud migration and infrastructure modernization require DevOps engineers who can drive transformation while maintaining reliability. My experience leading similar modernizations at [company] creates immediate value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "T-Mobile's infrastructure challenges — 5G network operations plus cloud-native platforms for 120M+ customers — are the most interesting in telecom. To align with the Seattle market: a base of $[X+10-12]K, RSU grant of $[Y+22-35]K, and a signing bonus of $[15-25]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[225-268]K, this reflects the competitive Seattle infrastructure market and the dual telecom-cloud complexity. I'm ready to commit."
