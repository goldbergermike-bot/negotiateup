**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at T-Mobile build models that optimize the nation's largest 5G network and personalize experiences for 120M+ postpaid customers. From network capacity planning and coverage optimization models to customer churn prediction, pricing optimization, and marketing attribution — data science at T-Mobile directly impacts the company's ability to leverage its $40B+ network investment and grow its subscriber base. T-Mobile's data scientists work with uniquely rich datasets that combine network performance metrics, customer behavior, competitive intelligence, and 5G service analytics.

T-Mobile has invested heavily in data science capabilities, recognizing that AI/ML-driven optimization is a key competitive advantage in wireless — the carrier that best predicts and responds to customer needs and network demands wins.

**Level Mapping:** T-Mobile Data Scientist (L4-L6) = Google L3-L5 DS = Meta E3-E5 DS = Amazon DS II-III = Microsoft 60-63

**T-Mobile Network Intelligence Premium**

T-Mobile's data science is uniquely impactful because models directly influence network investment decisions worth billions and customer retention for 120M+ subscribers. A churn prediction model that improves retention by 0.1% saves T-Mobile hundreds of millions annually. A network optimization model that improves 5G capacity utilization maximizes the ROI on tens of billions in spectrum and infrastructure investment.

**Global Levers**

1. **Network Optimization Revenue Impact:** "My models will optimize T-Mobile's 5G network — maximizing the ROI on $40B+ in spectrum and infrastructure investment. Even marginal improvements in network efficiency translate to hundreds of millions in value. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Customer Intelligence at Scale:** "Churn prediction, pricing optimization, and marketing attribution for 120M+ customers — my models directly impact T-Mobile's subscriber growth and customer lifetime value. RSUs of $[Y]K reflect this revenue impact."

3. **Seattle DS Market Competition:** "I have a competing offer from [Amazon/Microsoft/Google] at $[X]K in the Seattle market. T-Mobile's unique telecom data science opportunity is compelling, but the compensation needs to be locally competitive."

4. **5G Service Analytics:** "T-Mobile's 5G leadership creates unique analytics opportunities — modeling 5G service adoption, FWA capacity planning, and enterprise 5G usage patterns. This 5G analytics expertise is rare and valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Applying data science to T-Mobile's 5G network optimization and 120M+ customer intelligence is a compelling analytical challenge. To align with the Seattle market: a base of $[180-195]K, RSU grant of $[135-158]K, and a signing bonus of $[20-30]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[245-285]K, this reflects the competitive Seattle DS market and T-Mobile's unique network + customer analytics scope. I'm ready to accept."
