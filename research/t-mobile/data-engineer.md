### Data Engineer | T-Mobile Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $250B 5G Leader | Network + Customer Data at Scale | 5G Analytics Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Bellevue / Seattle | $132K–$188K | $50K–$152K | 10-15% | $168K–$275K |
| NYC / San Francisco | $137K–$193K | $55K–$158K | 10-15% | $178K–$288K |
| Dallas / Denver | $125K–$178K | $42K–$138K | 10-15% | $155K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at T-Mobile build the data infrastructure that powers intelligence across the nation's largest 5G network and 120M+ postpaid customer base. T-Mobile generates massive data volumes — network performance telemetry from millions of cell sites, customer usage patterns, billing and account data, and 5G service analytics. Data Engineers design the pipelines, streaming architectures, and data platforms that transform this data into the intelligence driving network optimization, customer experience personalization, churn prediction, and 5G service development.

T-Mobile's data infrastructure is undergoing significant modernization — migrating to cloud-native platforms, implementing real-time streaming architectures, and building the data foundations for AI/ML-driven network management and customer intelligence.

**Level Mapping:** T-Mobile Data Engineer (L4-L6) = Google L3-L5 DE = Meta E3-E5 DE = Amazon DE II-III = Microsoft 60-63

**T-Mobile Network Data Premium**

T-Mobile's data is uniquely valuable because it combines network performance data (cell site telemetry, 5G quality metrics, coverage data) with customer behavior data (usage patterns, churn signals, service preferences). Data Engineers who can build infrastructure connecting these domains enable T-Mobile to optimize its $40B+ network investment and drive customer lifetime value for 120M+ subscribers.

**Global Levers**

1. **Network + Customer Data Integration:** "I'll build data infrastructure that connects T-Mobile's 5G network telemetry with customer behavior data — enabling network optimization, customer intelligence, and 5G service analytics. This cross-domain data expertise is rare. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **5G Analytics Infrastructure:** "T-Mobile's 5G leadership generates unique data that powers next-generation analytics. Building the infrastructure to process and analyze 5G network data at scale requires specialized data engineering. RSUs of $[Y]K reflect this 5G data expertise."

3. **Bellevue/Seattle Market Competition:** "T-Mobile competes for data engineering talent in the Seattle market against Microsoft, Amazon, and Snowflake. I have a competing offer from [Big Tech/data company] at $[X]K total comp."

4. **Data Modernization Acceleration:** "T-Mobile's data infrastructure modernization is critical to leveraging AI/ML for network management and customer intelligence. My experience with [cloud-native data platforms] accelerates this transformation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Building T-Mobile's data platform — connecting 5G network intelligence with customer analytics for 120M+ subscribers — is a compelling data engineering challenge. To align with the Seattle market: a base of $[X+10-12]K, RSU grant of $[Y+25-38]K, and a signing bonus of $[18-28]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[230-275]K, this reflects the competitive data engineering market and T-Mobile's unique data platform opportunity. I'm ready to accept."
