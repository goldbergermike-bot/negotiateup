**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at T-Mobile own the architecture and implementation of systems that serve 120M+ postpaid customers and enable the company's 5G services strategy. At the Senior level, you drive technical decisions for T-Mobile's consumer platforms, network management systems, 5G-enabled services, or enterprise solutions. T-Mobile's Senior SWEs are expected to combine deep technical expertise with product and business acumen — understanding how engineering decisions impact customer experience and T-Mobile's competitive positioning against Verizon and AT&T.

T-Mobile's Senior SWE compensation has increased significantly as the company competes for senior talent in the Bellevue/Seattle market. Total comp of $205K-$345K reflects the competitive local market and the strategic importance of senior engineering talent to T-Mobile's technology transformation.

**Level Mapping:** T-Mobile Senior SWE (L6) = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Amazon SDE III = Microsoft 63 = Verizon L5 = AT&T Senior

**T-Mobile Senior Engineering Premium**

Senior SWEs at T-Mobile have outsized impact because the company's technology strategy is aggressive and fast-moving. Senior engineers drive decisions that affect millions of customers and differentiate T-Mobile from Verizon and AT&T. The company's willingness to challenge telecom conventions means Senior SWEs have more freedom to innovate and more influence on product direction than at more traditional carriers.

**Global Levers**

1. **Senior Technical Ownership at Scale:** "I'll own architecture decisions for systems serving 120M+ customers. At the Senior level, my technical decisions directly impact T-Mobile's 5G services, customer experience, and competitive positioning. I'd like a base of $[200-215]K."

2. **Seattle Tech Market Premium:** "T-Mobile competes for senior engineering talent against Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta in the Bellevue/Seattle market. Senior SWE packages at these companies are $350K-$500K+. I'd like RSUs of $[165-185]K to narrow this gap."

3. **5G Platform Architecture:** "T-Mobile's 5G services require senior engineers who can architect platforms leveraging 5G capabilities — low latency, network slicing, edge computing. My experience with [relevant technologies] positions me to drive this architecture."

4. **Un-carrier Technical Leadership:** "T-Mobile's culture of challenging telecom conventions requires senior engineers who bring innovation and modern engineering practices. My track record of driving technical innovation at [company] directly supports T-Mobile's Un-carrier strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the Senior SWE role — driving technical direction for T-Mobile's consumer platforms and 5G services at a $250B company with Un-carrier energy. To align with the Bellevue market: a base of $[205-215]K, RSU grant of $[165-185]K, and a signing bonus of $[30-40]K. My competing offer from [Google/Amazon] is $[X]K at L5/SDE III. At $[295-330]K, this reflects the Seattle senior engineering market and T-Mobile's consumer-scale impact. I'm ready to commit."
