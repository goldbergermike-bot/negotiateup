**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at T-Mobile orchestrate the delivery of complex technology programs across the nation's largest 5G network and 120M+ customer platform. When T-Mobile deploys a major 5G network upgrade across thousands of cell sites, launches a new consumer product to 120M+ customers, or rolls out enterprise 5G solutions — a TPM drives the program. The role demands deep technical literacy in both telecommunications and software platforms, combined with exceptional coordination across network engineering, software development, product, and operations teams.

T-Mobile's program complexity is unique because it spans both physical infrastructure (cell towers, spectrum deployment, network equipment) and digital platforms (consumer apps, enterprise services, 5G APIs). TPMs who can bridge these worlds deliver programs that neither a pure telecom TPM nor a pure software TPM could manage.

**Level Mapping:** T-Mobile TPM (L5-L7) = Google L4-L6 TPM = Meta E4-E6 TPM = Amazon TPM L5-L7

**T-Mobile Program Complexity Premium**

T-Mobile's TPMs operate in a uniquely complex environment that combines network infrastructure programs (5G deployment, spectrum activation, cell site construction) with software platform programs (app features, enterprise services, customer experience). This dual physical-digital program complexity, combined with the pace of T-Mobile's Un-carrier culture, creates TPM challenges that exceed most technology companies.

**Global Levers**

1. **Physical + Digital Program Complexity:** "T-Mobile's programs span network infrastructure deployment and software platform delivery — a dual complexity that doesn't exist at pure tech companies. My experience managing [infrastructure + software] programs is exactly this dual expertise."

2. **5G Deployment Scale:** "Managing 5G network deployment programs affecting thousands of cell sites and millions of customers requires exceptional coordination. My program delivery track record at [company] demonstrates this capability."

3. **Seattle TPM Market Competition:** "I have a competing offer from [Amazon/Microsoft/Google] at $[X]K in the Seattle market. T-Mobile's unique program complexity is compelling, but the compensation needs to be locally competitive."

4. **Un-carrier Delivery Pace:** "T-Mobile's culture demands faster delivery than traditional telecom. TPMs who can maintain this pace while managing cross-organization programs create significant competitive advantage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "T-Mobile's TPM challenges — managing programs that span 5G network deployment and software platform delivery at Un-carrier pace — are the most complex in telecom. To align with the Seattle market: a base of $[190-205]K, RSU grant of $[145-165]K, and a signing bonus of $[22-35]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[270-310]K, this reflects the dual physical-digital program complexity and the competitive Seattle TPM market. I'm ready to deliver."
