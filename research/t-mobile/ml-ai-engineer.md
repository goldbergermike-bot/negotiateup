**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at T-Mobile build the intelligence systems that optimize the nation's largest 5G network and personalize experiences for 120M+ customers. From AI-driven network optimization (predicting congestion, automating capacity planning, optimizing spectrum allocation) to customer intelligence (churn prediction, next-best-action, marketing personalization) to conversational AI (T-Mobile's customer service automation) — ML touches every critical function at a $250B wireless leader. T-Mobile's AI investment is strategic: the carrier that best leverages AI for network management and customer experience wins the competitive battle.

The AI Premium of 10-20% reflects extreme talent scarcity for ML engineers with telecom domain expertise — engineers who understand both modern ML frameworks and network optimization, customer analytics, or conversational AI.

**Level Mapping:** T-Mobile ML/AI Engineer (L5-L7) = Google L4-L6 ML = Meta E4-E6 ML = Amazon Applied Scientist II-III

**T-Mobile Network AI Premium**

T-Mobile's AI applications uniquely span network optimization and customer intelligence. AI-driven network management — predicting congestion patterns, automating spectrum allocation, optimizing 5G beamforming — can improve network performance for 120M+ customers while reducing operational costs. Customer AI — churn prediction, personalization, conversational service — drives subscriber growth and retention worth billions. ML engineers who can apply AI across both domains create outsized competitive advantage.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Talent Scarcity Premium:** "ML engineers with telecom domain expertise are exceptionally rare. I have competing offers from [Google/Amazon/Microsoft] at $[X]K including AI premiums. T-Mobile's offer should reflect this scarcity."

2. **Network AI Revenue Impact:** "AI-driven network optimization directly improves T-Mobile's 5G service quality and reduces operational costs. Even marginal improvements in network efficiency translate to hundreds of millions in value for a $250B carrier."

3. **Customer AI Retention Impact:** "Churn prediction and personalization models for 120M+ customers directly impact subscriber retention — each 0.1% improvement saves hundreds of millions annually. My models have direct P&L attribution."

4. **5G AI Innovation:** "T-Mobile's 5G leadership creates unique AI opportunities — network slicing optimization, edge AI inference, and 5G-enabled AI services. This intersection of 5G and AI is the frontier of telecom technology."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Applying AI to T-Mobile's 5G network optimization and 120M+ customer intelligence is the most compelling telecom ML opportunity in the industry. I hold a competing offer from [Google/Amazon] at $[X]K including an AI premium. To make T-Mobile competitive: $[200-215]K base, $[165-185]K RSUs, and a $[25-40]K signing bonus. At $[290-335]K, this reflects the AI talent premium and the dual network-customer ML impact. I'm ready to build T-Mobile's AI future."
