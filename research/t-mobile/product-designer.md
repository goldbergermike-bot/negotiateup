**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at T-Mobile shape the experience for 120M+ wireless customers across the T-Mobile app, account management, self-service tools, and 5G-enabled services. T-Mobile's Un-carrier strategy extends to design — challenging the confusing, frustrating experiences traditional carriers are known for and replacing them with simple, transparent, consumer-friendly interfaces. Your design decisions directly impact customer satisfaction (a key competitive differentiator), self-service adoption (reducing customer care costs), and the adoption of new 5G-enabled services.

T-Mobile has invested in building a strong design organization, recruiting talent from Big Tech consumer companies to bring modern design practices to wireless. The company's Bellevue headquarters location enables recruitment from the Seattle tech ecosystem.

T-Mobile's consumer experience is a key differentiator against Verizon and AT&T — simpler pricing, clearer account management, better self-service tools. Designers who can deliver on the Un-carrier promise through world-class consumer experience create measurable competitive advantage.
