**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at T-Mobile shape the experience for 120M+ wireless customers across the T-Mobile app, account management, self-service tools, and 5G-enabled services. T-Mobile's Un-carrier strategy extends to design — challenging the confusing, frustrating experiences traditional carriers are known for and replacing them with simple, transparent, consumer-friendly interfaces. Your design decisions directly impact customer satisfaction (a key competitive differentiator), self-service adoption (reducing customer care costs), and the adoption of new 5G-enabled services.

T-Mobile has invested in building a strong design organization, recruiting talent from Big Tech consumer companies to bring modern design practices to wireless. The company's Bellevue headquarters location enables recruitment from the Seattle tech ecosystem.

**T-Mobile Design Innovation Premium**

T-Mobile's Un-carrier positioning means design is a strategic competitive advantage, not just a functional requirement. T-Mobile's consumer experience is a key differentiator against Verizon and AT&T — simpler pricing, clearer account management, better self-service tools. Designers who can deliver on the Un-carrier promise through world-class consumer experience create measurable competitive advantage.

**Global Levers**

1. **Un-carrier Design Impact:** "T-Mobile's competitive advantage includes simpler, better consumer experience — design is literally a brand differentiator. My design work directly impacts how T-Mobile differentiates against Verizon and AT&T. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **120M+ Customer Scale:** "My designs will be used by 120M+ customers daily. At this scale, UX improvements in self-service, account management, and service adoption translate to millions in operational savings and revenue. RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Seattle Design Market Competition:** "I have a competing offer from [Amazon/Microsoft/Google] at $[X]K in the Seattle market. T-Mobile's Un-carrier design challenge is compelling, but the compensation needs to be locally competitive."

4. **5G Service Experience:** "Designing experiences for new 5G-enabled services — FWA broadband, IoT, edge computing — requires designers who can make complex technology accessible. This emerging design domain commands premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Designing T-Mobile's Un-carrier consumer experience for 120M+ customers — making wireless simple and delightful — is exactly the design challenge I want. To align with the Seattle market: a base of $[X+10-12]K, RSU grant of $[Y+20-30]K, and a signing bonus of $[12-20]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[205-245]K, this reflects the Seattle design market and the Un-carrier brand differentiation value of design. I'm ready to join."
