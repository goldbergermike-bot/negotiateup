### Security Engineer | T-Mobile Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $250B 5G Leader | Critical Telecom Infrastructure Security | Consumer Data + Network Protection

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Bellevue / Seattle | $140K–$200K | $52K–$162K | 12-15% | $180K–$295K |
| NYC / San Francisco | $145K–$205K | $58K–$168K | 12-15% | $190K–$310K |
| Dallas / Denver | $132K–$190K | $45K–$148K | 12-15% | $165K–$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at T-Mobile protect critical telecommunications infrastructure serving 120M+ postpaid customers, the nation's largest 5G network, and massive volumes of consumer personal and financial data. T-Mobile's security challenges are amplified by the company's history — previous data breaches have heightened the organization's security investment and commitment. The company has responded by building one of the most invested-in security programs in telecom, creating opportunities for Security Engineers to work with modern security tooling, threat intelligence, and security engineering practices.

T-Mobile's security scope spans network infrastructure security (5G core, RAN), application security (T-Mobile app, account systems), consumer data protection (PII, payment data, CPNI), and IoT/device security. Security Engineers are critical to maintaining customer trust and regulatory compliance.

**Level Mapping:** T-Mobile Security Engineer (L4-L6) = Google L3-L5 Security = Meta E3-E5 Security = Amazon Security Engineer II-III

**T-Mobile Security Investment Premium**

T-Mobile's elevated security investment — driven by previous incidents and regulatory scrutiny — means Security Engineers have access to significant resources, modern tooling, and organizational support. The company's security program is among the most well-funded in telecom, and Security Engineers who help T-Mobile demonstrate industry-leading security practices protect both the company's reputation and its regulatory standing.

**Global Levers**

1. **Critical Infrastructure Protection:** "I'll protect telecommunications infrastructure serving 120M+ Americans — infrastructure classified as critical national infrastructure. The scope and stakes of telecom security exceed most tech companies. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Security Investment Leverage:** "T-Mobile's elevated security investment means I'll work with best-in-class security tools and resources. This investment in security excellence is compelling, and I'd like RSUs of $[Y]K reflecting the importance T-Mobile places on security."

3. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Cybersecurity talent with telecom infrastructure expertise is exceptionally rare. I have a competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto/AWS] at $[X]K. T-Mobile needs to be competitive for this scarce talent."

4. **5G Security Frontier:** "5G introduces new security challenges — network slicing security, IoT device security, edge computing security. I bring expertise in emerging 5G security that is at the frontier of telecom cybersecurity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Protecting T-Mobile's 5G infrastructure and 120M+ customers' data is a security mission I'm passionate about — and T-Mobile's elevated security investment makes this an ideal environment. To align with market rates: a base of $[185-200]K, RSU grant of $[140-162]K, and a signing bonus of $[22-35]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[255-295]K, this reflects security talent scarcity and critical infrastructure protection responsibility. I'm ready to defend T-Mobile."
