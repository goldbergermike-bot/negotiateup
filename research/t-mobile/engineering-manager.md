### Engineering Manager | T-Mobile Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $250B 5G Leader | Multi-Team Technical Leadership | Platform + 5G Team Building

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Bellevue / Seattle | $168K–$235K | $78K–$218K | 15-20% | $235K–$385K |
| NYC / San Francisco | $175K–$242K | $82K–$225K | 15-20% | $245K–$400K |
| Dallas / Denver | $158K–$222K | $68K–$198K | 15-20% | $215K–$355K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at T-Mobile lead teams building technology for the most innovative wireless carrier in America. Whether you're managing a consumer platform team (T-Mobile app, customer experience), a 5G services team (FWA, enterprise, IoT), or a network engineering team, your leadership directly impacts products used by 120M+ customers and enables T-Mobile's $250B market position. T-Mobile EMs are expected to combine technical depth with strong people leadership — hiring Big Tech caliber engineers in the competitive Bellevue/Seattle market, setting technical direction, and delivering at the pace T-Mobile's Un-carrier culture demands.

T-Mobile has invested significantly in engineering management quality, recruiting leaders from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to bring Big Tech management practices to a telecom company with startup energy.

**Level Mapping:** T-Mobile EM (M1-M2) = Google L5-L6 Manager = Meta E5-E6 Manager = Amazon L6-L7 Manager = Microsoft 63-65 Manager

**T-Mobile Management Premium**

T-Mobile EMs have a unique talent attraction advantage: the company's innovative, fast-moving culture resonates with engineers who want meaningful consumer impact without Big Tech's scale of bureaucracy. However, leveraging this advantage requires EM compensation competitive with the Bellevue/Seattle market, where managers at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google earn $400K-$600K+ total comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **Seattle Market EM Competition:** "T-Mobile competes for engineering managers in the Bellevue/Seattle market against Amazon, Microsoft, and Google — where EM packages are $400K-$600K+. I'd like compensation that demonstrates T-Mobile's commitment to competitive management talent at $[X]K total comp."

2. **Talent Recruitment Multiplier:** "My ability to recruit engineers from Big Tech directly impacts T-Mobile's engineering capabilities. Competitive EM compensation enables me to credibly attract top talent from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google."

3. **5G Platform Team Leadership:** "Leading teams that build on T-Mobile's 5G advantage — creating differentiated products and services — requires managers with both technical depth and 5G domain understanding. This dual expertise commands premium compensation."

4. **Un-carrier Innovation Culture:** "T-Mobile's culture of challenging telecom conventions requires managers who can foster innovation while delivering reliably. My management track record at [company] aligns with this balance."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Leading engineering at T-Mobile — building teams that leverage the nation's best 5G network into differentiated products — is exactly the high-impact management I want. To align with the Seattle market: a base of $[220-235]K, RSU grant of $[195-218]K, 20% bonus, and a $[40-55]K signing bonus. My competing offer from [Amazon/Microsoft] is $[X]K. At $[340-385]K, this reflects the Seattle EM market and T-Mobile's unique 5G platform opportunity. I'm ready to lead."
