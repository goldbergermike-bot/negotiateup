**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at T-Mobile own the strategy and roadmap for products serving 120M+ wireless customers at a $250B company. Whether you're driving the T-Mobile app product strategy, defining next-generation 5G consumer services, or building enterprise wireless solutions, you sit at the intersection of technology, business, and the Un-carrier customer experience philosophy. T-Mobile PMs operate with high ownership and fast decision-making — the company's culture of challenging telecom conventions means product decisions move quickly and have outsized competitive impact.

T-Mobile has elevated the PM function significantly, hiring product leaders from Amazon, Google, and consumer tech companies. PMs here have meaningful P&L ownership and direct impact on subscriber growth, ARPU, and new revenue streams enabled by 5G.

**Level Mapping:** T-Mobile PM (P3-P5) = Google L4-L6 PM = Meta E4-E6 PM = Amazon PM L5-L7 = Microsoft 62-65 PM

**T-Mobile Product Strategy Premium**

T-Mobile PMs have a unique advantage: 5G leadership creates product opportunities that competitors cannot yet match. Products leveraging T-Mobile's superior 5G network — fixed wireless broadband, enterprise 5G, IoT connectivity — represent significant growth vectors. PMs who can identify and execute on these 5G-enabled product opportunities drive differentiated revenue growth.

At $[270-310]K, this reflects the Seattle PM market and T-Mobile's unique 5G product opportunity. I'm ready to accept."
