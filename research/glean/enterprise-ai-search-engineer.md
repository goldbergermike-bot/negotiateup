### Enterprise AI Search Engineer | Glean Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Growth-Stage Comp + Pre-IPO Equity | $4.6B Valuation | Palo Alto | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15-30% ML PREMIUM** | Enterprise AI Search Leader

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Palo Alto / Bay Area | $220K-$300K | $180K-$430K | — | $265K-$408K |
| New York City | $220K-$300K | $180K-$430K | — | $265K-$408K |
| Remote US | $198K-$270K | $162K-$387K | — | $239K-$367K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The Enterprise AI Search Engineer is Glean's signature role — the position at the core of building the AI-powered enterprise search platform that is rapidly becoming essential infrastructure for knowledge work. You will build and optimize the search and retrieval systems that understand enterprise data across every application — Slack, Google Workspace, Salesforce, Jira, Confluence, and hundreds more — using AI to deliver answers, not just links. This role combines deep search engineering (ranking, retrieval, NLP) with modern AI (LLMs, RAG, embeddings, knowledge graphs) at enterprise scale. The +15-30% ML Premium reflects the scarcity of engineers who can build AI-powered search systems that work reliably across massive, heterogeneous enterprise data.

**Level Mapping:** Glean Enterprise AI Search Engineer = Google L5-L6 Search Engineer = Meta AI Research Engineer IC5-IC6 = Elasticsearch Principal Engineer

**The Growth-Stage Equity Opportunity — $4.6B and Growing**
Glean is valued at $4.6B with explosive enterprise adoption — the company is one of the fastest-growing enterprise AI platforms. The equity represents significant pre-IPO upside: "Glean is dominating enterprise AI search with a $4.6B valuation and rapid revenue growth. I want my equity to reflect that I'm joining at the inflection point — before this becomes a $20B+ company."

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Scarcity:** "Enterprise AI search engineering — combining traditional search (ranking, retrieval, indexing) with modern AI (LLMs, RAG, embeddings) across heterogeneous enterprise data — requires a rare skill set that fewer than 500 engineers in the world possess at this level: $295K base and $420K equity/4yr."
2. **Enterprise Search + AI Dual Expertise:** "I bring deep experience in both search engineering (BM25, semantic search, knowledge graphs) and modern AI systems (RAG, LLM integration, embeddings). That dual expertise is Glean's core competency: $290K base."
3. **Competing Offers:** "Google Search offers $285K / $550K RSU for search infrastructure work. Anthropic offers $280K / $500K equity for RAG systems. Glean's enterprise AI search focus is uniquely compelling: $295K base and $425K equity/4yr."
4. **Revenue Impact:** "Enterprise AI search is Glean's entire product. My improvements to search quality directly drive enterprise adoption and expansion revenue: $290K base."
5. **Pre-IPO Equity at Inflection Point:** "Glean's $4.6B valuation is early for an enterprise platform with this adoption trajectory. I want front-loaded equity: $420K/4yr with 35% year-one vesting."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm an enterprise search engineer who has built AI-powered search systems at scale — semantic search, RAG pipelines, knowledge graphs, and cross-application retrieval. I'm holding a Google Search offer at $285K / $550K RSU and an Anthropic offer at $280K / $500K equity. Glean is building the platform that will define how knowledge workers access information, and I want to be at the core of that mission. To join: $295K base, $420K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $65K signing bonus. At $295K, I sign immediately. Floor is $265K."
