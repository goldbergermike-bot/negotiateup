**Negotiation DNA:** Salesforce Subsidiary ($15.7B Acquisition) | Data Visualization Leader | Liquid RSUs

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle HQ | $160K–$220K | $85K–$210K | 10-15% | $215K–$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Tableau build the AI-powered features that keep the visualization platform competitive. This includes Tableau AI (powered by Salesforce Einstein), automated insight generation, predictive analytics capabilities, and natural language query features (Ask Data). The Salesforce acquisition provides access to Einstein AI infrastructure, making Tableau DS roles part of a larger AI organization. Liquid RSUs and Salesforce comp bands apply.

**Level Mapping:** Tableau Senior DS = Salesforce LMTS DS = Google L4 DS = Meta IC4 DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Einstein AI Integration:** "Tableau AI leverages Salesforce Einstein infrastructure. I'm building AI features that serve both Tableau's millions of users and the broader Salesforce AI platform."
2. **Microsoft Copilot Competition:** "Tableau AI competes directly with Microsoft Copilot in Power BI. My AI features determine whether Tableau maintains market leadership."
3. **Automated Insights at Scale:** "Building automated insight generation for millions of Tableau users requires ML systems that work at unprecedented scale."
4. **Google/Meta DS Counter:** Both offer competitive DS compensation. Push for top-of-band RSUs.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $200K over 4 years. My Einstein AI integration work competes directly with Microsoft Copilot, and I have DS offers from Google and Meta." Counter at $165K-$190K RSUs is competitive.
