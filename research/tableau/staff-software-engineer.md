### Staff Software Engineer | Tableau Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Salesforce Subsidiary ($15.7B Acquisition) | Data Visualization Leader | Liquid RSUs

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle HQ | $210K–$260K | $180K–$340K | 10-15% | $340K–$475K |
| San Francisco | $215K–$265K | $185K–$350K | 10-15% | $345K–$485K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Engineers at Tableau are the technical architects who define the visualization platform's future direction. Within Salesforce, Staff Engineers map to the Principal MTS level, which is a well-established and well-compensated level. Staff Engineers at Tableau have the unique advantage of a stable, liquid comp package (Salesforce RSUs + bonus) combined with the technical influence of leading the industry-standard data visualization platform. Staff Engineers may also contribute to Salesforce-wide technical initiatives (Data Cloud, Einstein AI). [Source: Tableau/Salesforce Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Tableau Staff SWE = Salesforce Principal MTS = Google L5 = Meta E5

**Global Levers**

1. **Principal MTS Level Placement:** "I expect placement at the Principal MTS level within Salesforce, which includes top-of-band RSUs and the full Salesforce comp infrastructure."
2. **Cross-Org Technical Leadership:** "At Staff level, my influence extends beyond Tableau into Salesforce's broader data platform. I can contribute to Data Cloud, Einstein AI, and the broader Salesforce data strategy."
3. **Established Refresh Cycle:** "Salesforce has a consistent annual RSU refresh program. My long-term comp trajectory is predictable and stable — unlike startups where refreshes are discretionary."
4. **Google/Meta Staff Counter:** Both offer competitive Staff-level comp. Push for top of Principal MTS band.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $460K total comp with RSUs at $330K over 4 years at the Principal MTS level. I have Staff-level offers from Google and Meta with comparable equity." Counter at $290K-$320K RSUs is competitive.
