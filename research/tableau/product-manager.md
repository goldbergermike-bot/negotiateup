**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at Tableau own the product roadmap for the industry-standard data visualization platform within Salesforce. PMs balance maintaining Tableau's product excellence with integrating into the Salesforce platform (Data Cloud, Einstein AI, AppExchange). The PM role benefits from Salesforce's established PM career path and comp infrastructure. PMs on AI features (Tableau AI, Einstein integration) are the most sought-after.
