**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at Tableau own the product roadmap for the industry-standard data visualization platform within Salesforce. PMs balance maintaining Tableau's product excellence with integrating into the Salesforce platform (Data Cloud, Einstein AI, AppExchange). The PM role benefits from Salesforce's established PM career path and comp infrastructure. PMs on AI features (Tableau AI, Einstein integration) are the most sought-after.

**Level Mapping:** Tableau PM = Salesforce PM = Google L5 PM = Meta IC5 PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Category-Leading Product:** "I'm managing the roadmap for the category-leading data visualization product. Tableau defines the market — my product decisions set the standard."
2. **Salesforce Platform Integration:** "My product decisions impact how Tableau integrates with the $250B Salesforce ecosystem. Platform integration PM work has enormous downstream impact."
3. **Einstein AI Product Strategy:** If owning AI features, push for AI premium: "I'm defining Tableau's AI strategy against Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini."
4. **Google/Meta PM Counter:** Both offer competitive PM comp. Push for top of band.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $200K over 4 years. I'm managing the category-leading data visualization product and defining AI strategy." Counter at $165K-$190K RSUs is competitive.
