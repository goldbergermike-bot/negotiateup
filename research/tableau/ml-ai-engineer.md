### ML / AI Engineer | Tableau Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Salesforce Subsidiary ($15.7B Acquisition) | Data Visualization Leader | **+10–20% AI PREMIUM** | Liquid RSUs

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle HQ | $170K–$230K | $95K–$220K | 10-15% | $230K–$355K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Tableau build the Einstein AI-powered features within the visualization platform. This includes automated insights, natural language query (Ask Data), predictive analytics, and AI-powered visualization recommendations. Access to Salesforce's Einstein AI infrastructure and research teams provides resources that smaller competitors lack. ML/AI engineers at Tableau compete for talent against Microsoft (Power BI Copilot), Google (Looker Gemini), and pure-play AI companies. [Source: Tableau/Salesforce ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Tableau ML/AI Eng = Salesforce Einstein ML Eng = Google L4 ML = Meta IC4 ML

**Global Levers**

1. **Einstein AI Platform Access:** "I have access to Salesforce's Einstein AI infrastructure — one of the largest enterprise AI platforms in the world. This amplifies my individual ML impact."
2. **Microsoft Copilot Competition:** "Tableau AI competes directly with Microsoft Copilot in Power BI. Microsoft has billions in AI R&D budget. Attracting top ML talent to compete requires premium comp."
3. **Enterprise ML at Scale:** "Building ML features for millions of Tableau users requires production ML systems at unprecedented scale — not research prototypes."
4. **Google/OpenAI/Anthropic Counter:** AI companies offer $350K+ TC for ML engineers. Push Salesforce RSUs higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $345K total comp with RSUs at $210K over 4 years. Tableau AI competes against Microsoft Copilot, and I need comp that reflects the AI talent market." Counter at $175K-$200K RSUs is competitive.
