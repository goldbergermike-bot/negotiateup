**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Tableau manage infrastructure for both the Tableau Cloud (SaaS) platform and the on-premise Tableau Server deployments. Tableau's infrastructure is increasingly integrated with Salesforce's broader cloud infrastructure (Hyperforce), adding complexity. The dual-deployment model (cloud + on-premise) creates a larger infrastructure surface than pure-SaaS products. Salesforce's liquid RSUs and established comp bands provide stable compensation.

**Level Mapping:** Tableau Senior DevOps = Salesforce SRE = Google L4 SRE = Datadog DevOps

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual-Deployment Infrastructure:** "Supporting both Tableau Cloud and Tableau Server creates a significantly larger infrastructure surface than pure-SaaS platforms."
2. **Hyperforce Integration:** If working on Salesforce Hyperforce migration, push for premium: "I'm integrating Tableau into Salesforce's next-generation cloud infrastructure."
3. **Enterprise Scale:** "Tableau serves millions of users at enterprise scale. Infrastructure reliability directly impacts revenue and customer trust."
4. **Datadog/HashiCorp Counter:** Both offer competitive infrastructure comp. Push for top of band.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $175K over 4 years. I'm managing dual-deployment infrastructure at enterprise scale with Hyperforce integration requirements." Counter at $145K-$165K RSUs is competitive.
