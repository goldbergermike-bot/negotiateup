### Data Engineer | Tableau Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Salesforce Subsidiary ($15.7B Acquisition) | Data Visualization Leader | Liquid RSUs

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle HQ | $155K–$215K | $80K–$200K | 10-15% | $205K–$330K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Tableau build the data connectivity, preparation, and pipeline infrastructure that connects the visualization platform to enterprise data sources. Tableau connects to hundreds of data sources — cloud warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), databases, spreadsheets, and APIs. The Salesforce Data Cloud integration adds a new dimension: connecting Tableau's visualization engine with Salesforce's unified customer data platform. DEs benefit from Salesforce's liquid RSUs and established comp bands. [Source: Tableau/Salesforce DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Tableau Senior DE = Salesforce LMTS DE = Google L4 DE = Snowflake DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Cloud Integration:** If working on Salesforce Data Cloud integration, push for premium: "I'm connecting Tableau with Salesforce Data Cloud — the unified data layer for the entire Salesforce ecosystem. This integration impacts hundreds of thousands of customers."
2. **Multi-Source Connectivity:** "Tableau's value depends on connecting to every enterprise data source. My connector work directly impacts the platform's addressable market."
3. **Salesforce Comp Stability:** "Liquid RSUs, annual refreshes, and established comp bands make Salesforce/Tableau the stable choice. I should be at top of band for this stability."
4. **Snowflake/Databricks DE Counter:** Both pay premium for DE roles. Push RSUs higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $190K over 4 years. My data connectivity work directly impacts Tableau's addressable market, and I have competing DE offers from Snowflake and Databricks." Counter at $155K-$180K RSUs is competitive.
