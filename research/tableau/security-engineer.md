**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Tableau protect a platform that visualizes and presents enterprise data — financial metrics, customer data, HR information, and strategic business intelligence. Tableau's integration with Salesforce Data Cloud means security extends across the entire Salesforce data ecosystem. The dual-deployment model (Tableau Cloud + on-premise Server) creates a broad security surface. Salesforce's well-established security engineering team and comp bands apply.

**Level Mapping:** Tableau Senior Security Eng = Salesforce Security Eng = CrowdStrike Senior Eng = Google L4 Security

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Data Security:** "Tableau visualizes the most sensitive enterprise data. A security breach in the visualization layer could expose data that was otherwise secured in the warehouse."
2. **Salesforce Security Ecosystem:** "I'm part of Salesforce's broader security organization, which protects one of the largest enterprise SaaS platforms in the world."
3. **AI Security Challenges:** If securing AI features (Einstein, Ask Data), push for AI security premium: "AI features introduce prompt injection and data exfiltration risks through natural language queries."
4. **CrowdStrike/Palo Alto Counter:** Cybersecurity companies offer premium comp. Push Salesforce RSUs higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $200K over 4 years. I'm securing a platform that visualizes sensitive enterprise data across the entire Salesforce ecosystem." Counter at $165K-$190K RSUs is competitive.
