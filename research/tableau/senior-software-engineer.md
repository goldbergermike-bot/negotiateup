### Senior Software Engineer | Tableau Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Salesforce Subsidiary ($15.7B Acquisition) | Data Visualization Leader | Liquid RSUs

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle HQ | $170K–$225K | $100K–$220K | 10-15% | $230K–$345K |
| San Francisco | $175K–$230K | $105K–$225K | 10-15% | $235K–$355K |
| Remote US | $155K–$210K | $85K–$200K | 10-15% | $215K–$325K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at Tableau own significant subsystems of the data visualization platform — the VizQL engine, dashboard framework, data connectivity layer, or AI-powered features. Within the Salesforce organization, Tableau senior engineers have strong career growth paths into Salesforce's broader engineering org. The 10-15% bonus and liquid Salesforce RSUs provide a stable, transparent compensation structure. Senior engineers benefit from Salesforce's established comp bands and consistent refresh grants.

**Level Mapping:** Tableau Senior SWE = Salesforce LMTS = Google L4 = Meta E4

**Global Levers**

1. **Established Comp Bands:** "Salesforce has transparent comp bands. I expect to be placed at the top of band for LMTS given my experience and the technical depth required."
2. **Cross-Platform Technical Depth:** "Building visualizations that render consistently across desktop, web, mobile, and embedded requires deep platform expertise."
3. **Salesforce Career Path:** "My career path at Tableau includes growth into Salesforce's broader engineering leadership. The total career value extends beyond current comp."
4. **Snowflake/Databricks Counter:** Both offer higher equity at senior level. Push Salesforce RSUs higher: "Snowflake and Databricks are offering 30-40% higher equity grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $210K over 4 years, placed at top of band for LMTS. I'm owning core platform subsystems and I have competing offers with higher equity." Counter at $180K-$200K RSUs is strong.
