### Data Visualization Engineer | Tableau Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Salesforce Subsidiary ($15.7B Acquisition) | Data Visualization Leader | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | Liquid RSUs

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle HQ | $160K–$220K | $80K–$200K | 10-15% | $210K–$335K |
| San Francisco | $165K–$225K | $85K–$210K | 10-15% | $215K–$345K |
| Remote US | $145K–$200K | $70K–$180K | 10-15% | $195K–$310K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Tableau's signature engineering role. Data Visualization Engineers build the visualization rendering engine, chart types, interactive dashboard framework, and the visual analytics capabilities that made Tableau the industry standard for data visualization. Tableau was acquired by Salesforce for $15.7B in 2019, meaning engineers receive Salesforce RSUs (NYSE: CRM) — liquid, stable, and tied to a $250B+ market cap company. This liquidity is a major advantage over private competitors (ThoughtSpot, Alteryx). Tableau operates as a semi-autonomous division within Salesforce, maintaining its own engineering culture in Seattle while benefiting from Salesforce's compensation infrastructure.

**Level Mapping:** Tableau Data Viz Eng (Senior) = Salesforce LMTS = Google L4 = Meta E4

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Data Visualization Engineer works across Tableau's core rendering and analytics engine:
- **VizQL Engine:** Tableau's proprietary visual query language that translates data questions into visualizations
- **Chart Type Framework:** Building new chart types and visual analytics components
- **Dashboard Rendering:** High-performance interactive dashboard rendering at enterprise scale
- **Tableau AI (Einstein):** AI-powered visualization recommendations and automated insights
- **Cross-Platform Rendering:** Desktop, web, mobile, and embedded visualization consistency

**Global Levers**

1. **Industry Standard Builder:** "Tableau is the industry standard for data visualization. I'm building the rendering engine that defines how the world visualizes data. This is category-defining work."
2. **Salesforce Liquid RSUs:** "Salesforce RSUs are liquid and tied to a $250B+ market cap. This stability is a competitive advantage over ThoughtSpot (private) and Alteryx (PE-backed). I should get top-of-band because I'm choosing Tableau for the mission, not the liquidity premium."
3. **Einstein AI Visualization:** If working on AI-powered visualization, push for AI premium: "Tableau AI/Einstein visualization recommendations compete with Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini. This AI work justifies premium comp."
4. **VizQL Engine Rarity:** VizQL expertise is rare and deeply technical. Push for specialization premium.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $325K total comp with RSUs at $195K over 4 years. I'm building the industry-standard visualization engine, and I have offers from ThoughtSpot and Databricks with larger equity grants (compensating for illiquidity). Tableau's liquid RSUs are attractive, but the grant needs to reflect this role's importance." Counter at $160K-$185K RSUs is competitive.
