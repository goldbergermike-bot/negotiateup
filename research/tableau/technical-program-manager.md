### Technical Program Manager | Tableau Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Salesforce Subsidiary ($15.7B Acquisition) | Data Visualization Leader | Liquid RSUs

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle HQ | $155K–$215K | $75K–$190K | 10-15% | $200K–$325K |
| San Francisco | $160K–$220K | $80K–$195K | 10-15% | $205K–$335K |
| Remote US | $145K–$200K | $65K–$170K | 10-15% | $185K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

TPMs at Tableau coordinate cross-functional programs within both the Tableau engineering organization and across Salesforce. Key programs include Salesforce platform integration (Data Cloud, Einstein AI, Hyperforce), Tableau Cloud migration and scaling, AI feature launches, and enterprise security compliance. TPMs benefit from Salesforce's well-established program management culture and comp bands. The dual-org coordination (Tableau + Salesforce) adds complexity that pure-product TPMs don't face.

**Level Mapping:** Tableau Senior TPM = Salesforce Senior TPM = Google L5 TPM = Meta TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Org Program Management:** "I coordinate programs across both Tableau and Salesforce engineering organizations. This dual-org coordination is significantly more complex than single-org program management."
2. **Platform Integration Programs:** If managing Salesforce integration programs (Data Cloud, Hyperforce), push for premium: "These integration programs impact both Tableau's product and Salesforce's platform strategy."
3. **Established TPM Career Path:** Salesforce has a well-established TPM career path from Senior TPM to Director to VP.
4. **Google/Meta TPM Counter:** Both offer competitive TPM comp. Push for top of band.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $180K over 4 years. I'm coordinating programs across both Tableau and Salesforce engineering organizations — a dual-org complexity that's unique to this role." Counter at $150K-$175K RSUs is competitive.
