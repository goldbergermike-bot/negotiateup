### Software Engineer | Tableau Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Salesforce Subsidiary ($15.7B Acquisition) | Data Visualization Leader | Liquid RSUs

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle HQ | $145K–$200K | $60K–$180K | 10-15% | $185K–$300K |
| San Francisco | $150K–$205K | $65K–$185K | 10-15% | $190K–$310K |
| Remote US | $135K–$185K | $55K–$165K | 10-15% | $170K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Tableau is a Salesforce subsidiary (acquired for $15.7B), headquartered in Seattle. SWEs build the data visualization platform used by millions of analysts worldwide. Engineers receive Salesforce RSUs (NYSE: CRM, $250B+ market cap) — liquid and stable. Tableau maintains a semi-autonomous engineering culture within Salesforce, with its own engineering leadership, product roadmap, and Seattle campus. The 10-15% bonus is a meaningful cash component that ThoughtSpot and private competitors can't easily match. Salesforce's established compensation bands provide clear level mapping.

**Level Mapping:** Tableau SWE = Salesforce MTS = Google L3 = Meta E3

**Global Levers**

1. **Liquid RSU Stability:** "Salesforce RSUs are liquid and tied to a $250B+ company. This stability justifies choosing Tableau over higher-risk equity at startups."
2. **Industry-Standard Product:** "Tableau is the data visualization industry standard. I'm building a product that defines the category."
3. **Salesforce Ecosystem Integration:** If working on Salesforce platform integration (Einstein, Data Cloud), push for premium: "Integration with the $250B Salesforce ecosystem creates unique technical challenges and impact."
4. **ThoughtSpot/Databricks Counter:** Both offer larger equity grants (compensating for illiquidity or higher risk). Frame: "ThoughtSpot is offering a 40% larger equity grant. Tableau's liquid RSUs are attractive, but the gap should be smaller."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $170K over 4 years. I'm building the industry-standard data visualization platform, and competitors are offering larger equity grants." Counter at $140K-$160K RSUs is competitive.
