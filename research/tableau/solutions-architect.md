**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Tableau design and deploy data visualization solutions for enterprise customers. Tableau SAs are highly technical — they configure data connections, design dashboard architectures, optimize query performance, and integrate Tableau with enterprise data ecosystems. The Salesforce acquisition has expanded the SA role: SAs now help customers deploy Tableau as part of the broader Salesforce platform (CRM Analytics, Data Cloud). Salesforce comp and benefits apply.
