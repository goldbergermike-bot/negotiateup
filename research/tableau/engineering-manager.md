### Engineering Manager | Tableau Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Salesforce Subsidiary ($15.7B Acquisition) | Data Visualization Leader | Liquid RSUs

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle HQ | $205K–$255K | $160K–$310K | 10-15% | $315K–$445K |
| San Francisco | $210K–$260K | $165K–$320K | 10-15% | $320K–$455K |
| Remote US | $190K–$240K | $140K–$280K | 10-15% | $290K–$410K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Tableau lead teams building the industry-standard data visualization platform within the Salesforce organization. EMs benefit from Salesforce's mature management career path — clear level mapping, consistent comp bands, and established leadership development programs. The challenge is managing teams that maintain Tableau's product excellence while integrating with Salesforce's broader platform (Data Cloud, Einstein AI, Hyperforce). EMs at Tableau have the unique advantage of leading a semi-autonomous product team with the comp and career infrastructure of a $250B company. [Source: Tableau/Salesforce EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Tableau EM = Salesforce EM = Google L5 Manager = Meta M1

**Global Levers**

1. **Salesforce Management Career Path:** "Salesforce has one of the most established engineering management career paths in the industry. My growth trajectory from EM to Director to VP is clear and well-compensated."
2. **Product Integration Leadership:** "I'm managing teams that balance Tableau's product excellence with Salesforce platform integration. This dual mandate requires exceptional leadership."
3. **IC Parity:** Staff/Principal ICs at Salesforce can earn $300K+ in RSUs. EMs must match: "My equity needs to be at least equal to the Principal MTS ICs I manage."
4. **Google/Meta EM Counter:** Both offer competitive EM comp. Push for top of band.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $300K over 4 years. I'm managing Tableau engineering teams with Salesforce integration mandates, and I need comp that exceeds my Principal MTS ICs." Counter at $260K-$290K RSUs is competitive.
