**Negotiation DNA**

Payoneer Global Inc. (NASDAQ: PAYO) processes billions of dollars in cross-border payments for 2M+ customers across 190+ countries — generating massive volumes of transaction data that feed pricing models, risk systems, compliance reporting, and business analytics. The Jan 20, 2026 acquisition of Boundless adds a completely new data domain: employment records, payroll transactions, benefits data, compliance documentation, and EOR entity management data from the Compliant Global Employment platform. Data Engineers at Payoneer are tasked with building the unified data infrastructure that connects these two worlds.

The data engineering challenge post-Boundless is substantial. Two separate data platforms — Payoneer's payment transaction data warehouse and Boundless's employment data systems — must be integrated into a unified data architecture while maintaining data quality, regulatory compliance, and query performance. Data Engineers must build pipelines that handle real-time payment events, batch payroll processing, multi-currency transformations, and jurisdiction-specific data residency requirements. The combined platform needs to support operational analytics, regulatory reporting across financial and employment regulators, and ML/AI workloads.

Compensation includes RSU grants on a 4-year vesting schedule. Data engineering talent is in high demand across fintech, with competition from Wise, Deel, Remote, Stripe, and major cloud data companies. The Boundless integration creates acute demand for data engineers who can execute platform migrations and build cross-domain data models — a window of leverage that candidates should capitalize on.

### Boundless — The Compliant Global Employment Premium

**Lever 1: Data Platform Unification Post-Acquisition**

The Jan 20, 2026 Boundless acquisition requires merging two data platforms into one. Data Engineers who can execute this unification while maintaining data quality and compliance are exceptionally valuable.

> *"Merging Payoneer's payment data warehouse with Boundless's employment data systems is a foundational data engineering project. The unified platform needs to support real-time payment analytics, batch payroll reporting, cross-domain joins between payment and employment data, and regulatory reporting for both financial and employment regulators across 190+ countries. I've led data platform consolidations during acquisitions, and that experience justifies a base of $175,000 with an $80,000 RSU grant."*

**Lever 2: Multi-Jurisdiction Data Compliance Pipelines**

The Compliant Global Employment platform requires data pipelines that respect jurisdiction-specific data residency, retention, and privacy requirements — a specialized data engineering challenge.

> *"Building data pipelines for Compliant Global Employment isn't standard ETL — every jurisdiction has different rules for data residency, retention periods, and access controls. A payroll record for an EOR employee in Germany has different handling requirements than one in Singapore. I've built compliance-aware data architectures for regulated environments, and that specialization commands a $15,000 premium. Can we move the base to $170,000?"*

**Lever 3: Cross-Domain Data Models for Revenue Growth**

Data Engineers who can build the models connecting payment data with employment data enable new revenue opportunities — working capital products based on payroll data, employment cost analytics for marketplace sellers, and compliance risk scoring.

> *"The highest-leverage data engineering work at Payoneer right now is building cross-domain data models that connect payment transactions with Compliant Global Employment records. These models enable new products: working capital underwriting using payroll data, employment cost forecasting for marketplace sellers, and compliance risk scores that combine financial and employment signals. That revenue-driving data work justifies $180,000 base and a performance bonus tied to product launches."*

**Lever 4: Data Engineering Talent Competition**

Fintech data engineers with cross-border experience are actively recruited by Stripe, Wise, Deel, and major tech companies. Payoneer must compete at market rate.

> *"I have an offer from Stripe at $290,000 total comp for a data engineering role focused on cross-border payments. Payoneer's combined payments-plus-employment data challenge is more interesting — the Boundless acquisition created a dataset no competitor can replicate. But I need the total comp within competitive range. Can we get to $280,000 through a $170,000 base, $80,000 RSU, and $30,000 bonus?"*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $280,000+ total compensation in New York by anchoring at $175,000 base and $80,000 RSU. The strongest lever is data platform unification — the Jan 20, 2026 Boundless acquisition created a data consolidation mandate that directly determines whether Payoneer can unlock cross-domain revenue opportunities. Accept-at floor: $225,000 total comp ($150,000 base + $50,000 RSU + $25,000 bonus). Below this, the role is priced as standard fintech data engineering when the Boundless acquisition demands cross-domain platform unification expertise.
