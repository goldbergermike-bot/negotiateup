### Data Scientist | Waymo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Google-Adjacent Comp | Alphabet RSUs (GOOGL) | Self-Driving Leader | Top-Tier Stability

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View (HQ) | $170K-$235K | $145K-$390K | 15% | $260K-$425K |
| San Francisco | $170K-$235K | $145K-$390K | 15% | $260K-$425K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Waymo Data Scientists analyze the performance of the world's most advanced autonomous driving system using data that no other company has access to. You quantify safety metrics, measure ride quality, analyze fleet operations, optimize routing, and build the analytical frameworks that help Waymo demonstrate to regulators, riders, and the public that autonomous vehicles are safer than human drivers. This is data science with real-world stakes — your analyses directly inform safety decisions, expansion planning, and regulatory strategy. Waymo's compensation follows Google bands with GOOGL RSUs, and the role requires a rare combination of statistical rigor and domain expertise in autonomous driving, transportation, and safety-critical systems.

**Level Mapping:** Waymo Data Scientist = Google DS L3-L4 = Meta Data Scientist (IC3-IC4) = Amazon Applied Scientist = Apple Data Scientist

**Global Levers**

1. **Unique Autonomous Driving Dataset:** "I'll analyze the most comprehensive real-world autonomous driving dataset in existence — millions of miles of driverless operation with rich sensor, telemetry, and rider data. This dataset is unique to Waymo, and the analytical insights I extract directly shape the company's safety case and expansion strategy."
2. **Safety-Critical Analytics:** "My analyses directly inform Waymo's safety decisions and regulatory strategy. When I quantify the safety performance of the autonomous driving system, those numbers go to regulators, board members, and the public. Analytical rigor in this role has stakes that far exceed typical data science."
3. **Google DS Parity:** "I expect compensation competitive with Google Data Scientist bands, plus a premium for the specialized domain expertise in autonomous driving safety and fleet analytics."
4. **Regulatory Impact:** "Waymo's expansion to new cities depends on demonstrating safety to regulators. My analytical work — safety comparisons, incident analysis, performance metrics — is the evidence base that makes expansion possible. I'm not just analyzing data; I'm enabling Waymo's commercial growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Waymo's data science challenges are uniquely high-stakes — my analyses will directly inform safety decisions and regulatory strategy for autonomous vehicles. I'm targeting $350K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $225K. I have a Google DS offer at $[X] and a competing offer from [Meta/Netflix] at $[Y]. Waymo's unique dataset and mission make this the most impactful DS role available." Accept at $300K+ RSUs with base above $210K.
