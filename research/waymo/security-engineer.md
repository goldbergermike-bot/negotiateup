**Negotiation DNA**

Waymo Security Engineers protect the most safety-critical software system in consumer technology — autonomous vehicles operating on public roads. A security breach at Waymo doesn't mean stolen data; it could mean compromised vehicle control systems, manipulated sensor data, or unauthorized access to fleet operations. The security stakes at Waymo exceed any other tech company: you're protecting a system where a security failure could have physical-world consequences. Waymo's security scope spans vehicle software security, cloud infrastructure protection, fleet communication security, sensor data integrity, and regulatory compliance. Compensation follows Google Security Engineering bands with GOOGL RSUs. The role requires expertise in embedded systems security, automotive cybersecurity standards, and cloud security — a rare combination. [Source: Waymo Security Engineering Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Waymo Security Engineer = Google Security Engineer L3-L4 = Meta Security Engineer (IC3-IC4) = Amazon Security Engineer = Apple Security Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **Safety-Critical Security:** "I'm protecting autonomous vehicles operating on public roads — a security breach could compromise vehicle control systems with physical-world safety consequences. This is the highest-stakes security engineering role in tech, and compensation should reflect these stakes."
2. **Automotive + Cloud Security Expertise:** "Waymo's security spans embedded vehicle systems, cloud infrastructure, fleet communications, and sensor data integrity. This requires expertise across automotive cybersecurity (ISO 21434), cloud security, and embedded systems security — a rare combination that commands a premium."
3. **Google Security Parity:** "My compensation should match Google Security Engineering bands. I have a Google security offer at $[X] — Waymo's unique security challenges are compelling, but comp needs to be at parity."
4. **Regulatory Compliance Impact:** "Autonomous vehicle security is increasingly regulated. My work ensures Waymo meets evolving cybersecurity requirements from NHTSA, state regulators, and international standards. Security compliance directly enables Waymo's expansion."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Waymo's security challenges are uniquely high-stakes — protecting autonomous vehicles on public roads. I'm targeting $350K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $225K. I have a Google Security Engineer offer at $[X] and a competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto Networks] at $[Y]. The automotive + cloud security combination at Waymo is uniquely compelling." Accept at $300K+ RSUs with base above $210K.
