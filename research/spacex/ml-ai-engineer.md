### ML/AI Engineer | SpaceX Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Mission-Driven Equity + Intensity Premium | $180B+ Private Valuation | Autonomous Systems/Computer Vision | 60+ Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Hawthorne, CA | $155K-$210K | $110K-$300K | Performance | $205K-$375K |
| Redmond, WA | $155K-$210K | $110K-$300K | Performance | $205K-$375K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at SpaceX build the autonomous systems that will define the future of spaceflight. Key domains include: computer vision for autonomous docking and landing, predictive models for satellite constellation management, anomaly detection in vehicle telemetry, natural language processing for mission documentation, and reinforcement learning for spacecraft navigation. Starship's Mars mission requires fully autonomous operation -- no ground control possible with 20-minute communication delays. Every ML model you deploy has physical-world consequences: your computer vision model guides a spacecraft to dock with the ISS, your anomaly detector decides whether to abort a mission. ML talent at SpaceX is scarcer than SWE talent because few ML engineers want aerospace hours and constraints. [Source: SpaceX ML Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** SpaceX ML Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML = DeepMind Research Eng -- but with real-world physical system deployment

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Physical-World ML Deployment:** "My models control physical systems -- spacecraft, rockets, satellites. ML deployment at SpaceX has consequences that don't exist in ad tech or recommendation systems."
- **Autonomous Spaceflight:** "Mars missions require fully autonomous ML systems -- no human override possible. I build ML for the highest-autonomy application in existence."
- **ML Talent Scarcity at SpaceX:** "ML engineers willing to work SpaceX hours in aerospace are extremely rare. My combination of ML expertise and aerospace willingness commands a scarcity premium."

**Global Levers**

1. **Autonomous Spaceflight ML:** "I build ML systems for autonomous spacecraft operation -- the highest-consequence ML deployment in the world. Mars missions require full autonomy with no ground override."
2. **Computer Vision for Docking/Landing:** "My CV models guide spacecraft to dock with the ISS and land boosters on drone ships. This is physical-world computer vision at the highest stakes."
3. **ML Scarcity Premium:** "ML engineers willing to work SpaceX hours are exceptionally rare. Competing demand from FAANG and AI startups at higher comp makes SpaceX ML recruiting very difficult."
4. **Starlink ML Optimization:** "ML-driven satellite constellation optimization directly improves service for 3M+ subscribers and drives revenue growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build autonomous ML systems for spacecraft -- the highest-consequence ML deployment in the world. ML engineers willing to work SpaceX hours are rare, and competing offers from [Google Brain/DeepMind/OpenAI] are $380K+ total comp with liquidity. I'm targeting $280K in equity over 4 years. SpaceX's autonomous spaceflight mission is unmatched -- but the equity must reflect both the ML talent scarcity and the physical-world deployment premium." Accept at $240K+ equity.
