### Product Designer | SpaceX Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Mission-Driven Equity + Intensity Premium | $180B+ Private Valuation | Starlink Consumer/Enterprise Design | 60+ Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Hawthorne, CA | $135K-$180K | $80K-$220K | Performance | $175K-$300K |
| Redmond, WA | $135K-$180K | $80K-$220K | Performance | $175K-$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at SpaceX shape the Starlink user experience -- from the consumer app used by 3M+ subscribers to the enterprise networking dashboard, aviation and maritime connectivity interfaces, and internal mission control tools. Design at SpaceX is lean: a small team covers what would be 20+ designers at a FAANG company. Each designer owns entire product surfaces end-to-end, from research through shipping. The engineering-first culture means designers must be technically fluent and able to work directly with firmware and systems engineers. SpaceX design is high-impact but under-resourced compared to tech companies, meaning your individual design decisions reach millions of users with less organizational support.

**Level Mapping:** SpaceX Product Designer = Google L4-L5 UX = Meta IC4-IC5 -- with broader scope and less design org support

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Lean Design Team, Massive Scope:** "SpaceX's design team is a fraction of FAANG size. I own product surfaces that would be staffed by 3-5 designers elsewhere."
- **Hardware-Integrated Design:** "I design interfaces for satellite hardware, ground stations, and mission operations -- not just consumer apps. Hardware-integrated design is rare."
- **3M+ User Impact:** "My design decisions directly impact 3M+ Starlink subscribers. Per-designer user impact is among the highest in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **Starlink User Experience:** "Starlink's 3M+ subscribers interact with my designs daily. User experience directly drives retention and subscriber growth."
2. **Lean Design Team Leverage:** "I cover the design surface of 3-5 FAANG designers. My individual leverage on user experience is extraordinary."
3. **Hardware-Software Design:** "Designing across satellites, consumer apps, and mission control tools requires a design versatility that pure software designers don't develop."
4. **Starlink IPO Thesis:** "My equity participates in Starlink's $100B+ IPO trajectory. Strong design drives the subscriber metrics that determine valuation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I design for Starlink's 3M+ subscribers with a scope that would require 3-5 designers at Google. I'm targeting $200K in equity over 4 years. My competing design offer from [FAANG] is $260K total comp for a narrower design surface. Starlink's growth and my outsized per-designer impact justify the equity." Accept at $170K+ equity.
