### Senior Software Engineer | SpaceX Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Mission-Driven Equity + Intensity Premium | $180B+ Private Valuation | Starship/Falcon/Starlink | 60+ Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Hawthorne, CA | $155K-$205K | $120K-$320K | Performance | $210K-$385K |
| Starbase, TX | $145K-$195K | $120K-$320K | Performance | $200K-$375K |
| Redmond, WA | $155K-$205K | $120K-$320K | Performance | $210K-$385K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at SpaceX are the technical backbone of the company's software infrastructure. Whether you work on Falcon mission software, Starlink ground systems, Starship avionics, or Dragon crew systems, you're building software that operates at the highest consequence level in the industry. SpaceX's $180B+ private valuation makes it the most valuable private company ever. Senior engineers are expected to own entire subsystems with minimal management oversight -- SpaceX runs lean teams where each engineer covers the work of 2-3 at traditional aerospace. 60+ hours/week is baseline. Equity is illiquid but appreciating, with tender offers providing periodic liquidity. [Source: SpaceX Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** SpaceX Senior SWE = Google L4-L5 = Meta E4-E5 -- with higher ownership scope and 1.5x hours

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Ownership Scope Premium:** "I own entire subsystems at SpaceX -- work that would be split across 2-3 engineers at Google. This ownership scope premium should be reflected in equity."
- **Hardware-Software Integration:** "I write software that interfaces directly with physical hardware -- rockets, satellites, ground stations. Hardware-coupled software engineering is scarcer and more valuable than pure cloud software."
- **Launch Campaign Surges:** "Launch campaigns require 80+ hour weeks. These surge periods represent significant personal sacrifice beyond the 60+ hour baseline."

**Global Levers**

1. **System Ownership:** "As a Senior SWE, I own complete subsystems end-to-end. SpaceX's lean team structure means my impact scope is 2-3x what it would be at FAANG."
2. **$180B+ Trajectory + Starlink IPO:** "My equity participates in both the launch services business and the Starlink constellation. The Starlink IPO alone could make this the most valuable equity grant of my career."
3. **Hardware-Software Scarcity:** "Engineers who can write production software that controls physical systems (rockets, satellites) are extremely scarce. This skill commands a premium."
4. **Maximum Equity Push:** "Below-market base, illiquid equity, 60+ hours, system ownership. Equity must compensate: $290K over 4 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "As a Senior SWE, I own entire subsystems that SpaceX would staff with 2-3 engineers at Google. I'm accepting below-market base, illiquidity, and 60+ hour weeks. I'm targeting $290K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [FAANG] is $320K total comp with full liquidity at 40 hours. SpaceX's mission and Starlink IPO thesis are compelling -- but the equity must close the gap." Accept at $250K+ equity.
