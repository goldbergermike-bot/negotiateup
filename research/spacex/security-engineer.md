**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at SpaceX protect the most consequential attack surface in the tech industry: the Starlink satellite constellation (5,000+ satellites), rocket launch systems, Dragon crew capsules carrying astronauts, and national security payload missions. SpaceX handles ITAR-controlled data, works with the DOD and intelligence community, and operates critical space infrastructure that nation-state adversaries actively target. A security breach could compromise national security missions, endanger astronaut safety, or disrupt internet service for millions. Security at SpaceX spans satellite communications security, ground station hardening, launch infrastructure protection, and insider threat programs. Clearance-eligible or cleared candidates receive a premium. [Source: SpaceX Security Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** SpaceX Security Eng = Google L4-L5 Security = CrowdStrike Senior -- but with space systems, ITAR, and national security scope

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Nation-State Threat Model:** "I defend against nation-state adversaries targeting space infrastructure. This threat model is more sophisticated than standard enterprise security."
- **Space Systems Security:** "Satellite communications security, ground station hardening, and launch infrastructure protection -- these security domains don't exist at most companies."
- **ITAR and Clearance Requirements:** "I handle ITAR-controlled data and may work on classified programs. The clearance requirement constrains my career flexibility."

**Global Levers**

1. **Critical Space Infrastructure:** "I protect 5,000+ Starlink satellites, rocket launch systems, and crew capsules. This is the most consequential security surface in tech."
2. **National Security Missions:** "SpaceX launches DOD and intelligence payloads. My security work directly supports national security -- breach consequences extend far beyond data loss."
3. **Nation-State Defense:** "SpaceX is a target for nation-state adversaries (China, Russia). I defend against the most sophisticated threat actors in the world."
4. **Clearance Premium:** "Security clearance constrains my career options and personal life. This constraint deserves a 10-15% premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I protect the most consequential attack surface in tech -- 5,000+ satellites, national security payloads, and crew capsules targeted by nation-state adversaries. ITAR and potential clearance requirements constrain my career. I'm targeting $260K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto] is $300K total comp with liquidity and no clearance constraints. SpaceX's national security mission and equity upside must compensate." Accept at $220K+ equity.
