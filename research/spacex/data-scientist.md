### Data Scientist | SpaceX Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Mission-Driven Equity + Intensity Premium | $180B+ Private Valuation | Satellite Analytics/Predictive Maintenance | 60+ Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Hawthorne, CA | $140K-$190K | $90K-$260K | Performance | $185K-$330K |
| Redmond, WA | $140K-$190K | $90K-$260K | Performance | $185K-$330K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at SpaceX work on problems that don't exist at any other company: predicting satellite hardware failures from orbital telemetry, optimizing Starlink constellation coverage patterns, modeling rocket engine performance degradation, and analyzing launch vehicle reusability data. Every model you build has direct hardware consequences -- your predictive maintenance models determine whether a Falcon 9 booster flies again or gets retired. Starlink network optimization models directly impact service quality for 3M+ subscribers. The data is unique (orbital mechanics, propulsion telemetry, atmospheric re-entry heating) and the consequence is extreme (bad models = lost vehicles or degraded service).

**Level Mapping:** SpaceX DS = Google L4 DS = Meta DS IC4 -- with unique aerospace data domains

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Unique Aerospace Data Domain:** "Orbital mechanics, propulsion telemetry, re-entry thermal modeling -- these data domains are exclusive to SpaceX and NASA. My expertise development is SpaceX-specific."
- **Hardware-Consequence Models:** "My predictive models determine whether a $60M booster flies again. Model errors have direct hardware cost consequences -- not just metric movements."
- **Constellation Optimization:** "I optimize coverage patterns for 5,000+ satellites serving 3M+ subscribers. My models directly impact Starlink revenue and user experience."

**Global Levers**

1. **Booster Reusability Analytics:** "My models determine if a Falcon 9 booster is safe to fly again -- a decision worth $60M per flight. Model accuracy directly drives SpaceX's economics."
2. **Constellation Optimization:** "I optimize the orbital mechanics of 5,000+ Starlink satellites to maximize coverage. This is the most complex network optimization problem in existence."
3. **Unique Data Domain:** "Aerospace telemetry data science skills are extraordinarily rare. My expertise is developed exclusively at SpaceX and doesn't transfer to standard tech roles."
4. **Revenue Impact:** "Starlink service quality and booster reusability both directly drive revenue. My models have measurable P&L impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build predictive models that determine $60M booster reusability decisions and optimize coverage for 5,000+ satellites. My data science domain (orbital mechanics, propulsion telemetry) is exclusively developed at SpaceX. I'm targeting $240K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [FAANG] is $280K total comp for transferable cloud data science. SpaceX's unique domain and equity trajectory must compensate." Accept at $210K+ equity.
