### DevOps Engineer | SpaceX Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Mission-Driven Equity + Intensity Premium | $180B+ Private Valuation | Launch Infrastructure/Starlink Ops | 60+ Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Hawthorne, CA | $140K-$185K | $85K-$240K | Performance | $180K-$320K |
| Redmond, WA | $140K-$185K | $85K-$240K | Performance | $180K-$320K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at SpaceX manage the infrastructure that supports 100+ rocket launches per year and the world's largest satellite constellation. This is not standard cloud DevOps -- you manage hybrid infrastructure spanning ground stations across 40+ countries, mission control systems, launch site networks, and the Starlink satellite operations platform. Deployments have real-world physical consequences: a bad configuration push to ground stations can knock Starlink offline for millions of users, and mission control infrastructure must have zero downtime during launch windows. SpaceX DevOps runs leaner than FAANG -- each engineer manages infrastructure that would require 3-5 SREs at Google. [Source: SpaceX DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** SpaceX DevOps = Google L4 SRE = Amazon Senior SysDE -- but with physical infrastructure and launch operations

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Launch Operations On-Call:** "I maintain infrastructure during launch operations -- zero-downtime windows where failures delay $200M missions. This on-call intensity exceeds standard SRE."
- **Hybrid Physical Infrastructure:** "I manage ground stations across 40+ countries, not just cloud regions. Physical infrastructure DevOps is scarcer and more complex than cloud-only."
- **Lean Infrastructure Team:** "I manage infrastructure that would require 3-5 SREs at Google. My per-engineer infrastructure scope is extraordinary."

**Global Levers**

1. **Launch-Critical Infrastructure:** "Mission control and launch infrastructure must have zero downtime during launch windows. My infrastructure work directly enables 100+ launches/year."
2. **Global Ground Station Network:** "I manage Starlink ground stations across 40+ countries -- hybrid physical-cloud infrastructure that doesn't exist at cloud-native companies."
3. **Starlink Uptime = Revenue:** "Starlink service uptime for 3M+ subscribers directly drives revenue. My infrastructure reliability has measurable P&L impact."
4. **Lean Team Leverage:** "I cover infrastructure that would require 3-5 SREs at Google. My per-engineer impact and scope deserve recognition."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage launch-critical infrastructure and a global ground station network across 40+ countries -- infrastructure that directly enables 100+ launches/year and 3M+ Starlink subscribers. My scope is 3-5x a Google SRE. I'm targeting $220K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [FAANG] is $270K total comp for cloud-only infrastructure. SpaceX's unique physical infrastructure challenges and equity trajectory must compensate." Accept at $190K+ equity.
