### Solutions Architect | SpaceX Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Mission-Driven Equity + Intensity Premium | $180B+ Private Valuation | Starlink Enterprise/Government Solutions | 60+ Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Hawthorne, CA | $155K-$200K | $100K-$270K | Performance | $205K-$350K |
| Redmond, WA | $155K-$200K | $100K-$270K | Performance | $205K-$350K |
| Washington, DC | $155K-$200K | $100K-$270K | Performance | $205K-$350K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at SpaceX design and deploy Starlink enterprise and government connectivity solutions. Starlink Business, Starlink Aviation, Starlink Maritime, and Starlink Government represent SpaceX's fastest-growing revenue segments. SAs work with airlines, shipping companies, government agencies, and enterprises to architect Starlink deployments at scale -- integrating satellite connectivity into existing IT infrastructure, designing redundancy architectures, and ensuring compliance with government security requirements. This is a customer-facing technical role with travel requirements and direct revenue attribution. Every enterprise deal you architect contributes directly to Starlink's $3B+ revenue base.

**Level Mapping:** SpaceX SA = AWS Senior SA = Azure Solutions Architect -- but with satellite networking and government security compliance

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Direct Revenue Attribution:** "Every enterprise deployment I architect has measurable revenue. I'm not a cost center -- I directly contribute to Starlink's $3B+ revenue."
- **Satellite Networking Expertise:** "I architect solutions using satellite connectivity -- a networking domain that cloud SAs don't understand. This unique expertise commands a premium."
- **Government Compliance:** "I design Starlink Government solutions meeting DOD/IC security requirements. Government-compliant solution architecture is scarce and high-value."

**Global Levers**

1. **Starlink Revenue Growth:** "Starlink enterprise revenue is SpaceX's fastest-growing segment. My solution architectures directly drive deal closure and revenue growth."
2. **Satellite Networking Scarcity:** "SAs who understand satellite constellation networking, ground station architecture, and space-based connectivity are extremely rare."
3. **Government Solutions Premium:** "Starlink Government solutions require security compliance expertise (FedRAMP, IL5+). This adds complexity and career constraint value."
4. **Direct Revenue Impact:** "My architectural designs directly determine enterprise deal sizes -- typically $500K-$10M+. My individual revenue attribution is measurable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I architect Starlink enterprise solutions with direct revenue attribution -- deals ranging from $500K to $10M+. Satellite networking SAs are extremely rare, and my government compliance expertise adds additional scarcity value. I'm targeting $250K in equity over 4 years. My competing SA offer from [AWS/Azure] is $290K total comp for cloud-only architecture. SpaceX's Starlink revenue trajectory and unique domain must compensate." Accept at $215K+ equity.
