### Data Engineer | SpaceX Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Mission-Driven Equity + Intensity Premium | $180B+ Private Valuation | Starlink/Telemetry Data Infrastructure | 60+ Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Hawthorne, CA | $140K-$190K | $90K-$260K | Performance | $185K-$330K |
| Redmond, WA | $140K-$190K | $90K-$260K | Performance | $185K-$330K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at SpaceX build the data infrastructure that processes telemetry from 5,000+ Starlink satellites, Falcon 9 launches (100+/year), Starship test campaigns, and Dragon crew missions. This is data engineering at a scale and consequence level that doesn't exist elsewhere: real-time satellite telemetry processing, launch vehicle health monitoring, and orbital mechanics data pipelines. SpaceX generates petabytes of data from its constellation and launch operations. Data infrastructure directly enables mission safety -- telemetry anomalies must be detected in real-time to prevent vehicle loss. Below-market base with illiquid equity; the Starlink data infrastructure work is among the most unique data engineering in the industry. [Source: SpaceX DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** SpaceX DE = Google L4 DE = Databricks Senior DE -- but with real-time telemetry and satellite constellation data

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Telemetry-Critical Infrastructure:** "My data pipelines process real-time telemetry from 5,000+ satellites and active rocket flights. Pipeline failures during flight operations can compromise mission safety."
- **Unique Data Domain:** "Satellite constellation telemetry, orbital mechanics data, and launch vehicle health monitoring -- these data domains don't exist at any other company except NASA."
- **Scale + Consequence:** "Petabyte-scale data infrastructure where latency directly impacts mission safety. This is not typical batch ETL work."

**Global Levers**

1. **5,000+ Satellite Telemetry:** "I process real-time telemetry from the largest satellite constellation ever deployed. This data engineering challenge is unprecedented in scale and criticality."
2. **Mission Safety Data:** "Telemetry anomaly detection directly prevents vehicle loss. My data pipelines are safety-critical infrastructure."
3. **Unique Data Domain Premium:** "Orbital mechanics, launch vehicle telemetry, and satellite constellation data -- skills that transfer to exactly zero other companies except NASA/JPL."
4. **Starlink Data Scale:** "Starlink's 3M+ subscribers and 5,000+ satellites generate data at a scale that rivals the largest tech companies, with higher consequence."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build data infrastructure processing real-time telemetry from 5,000+ satellites and 100+ annual rocket launches -- safety-critical data engineering that doesn't exist elsewhere. I'm targeting $240K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [Databricks/Snowflake] is $300K total comp for cloud-native, transferable-skills data engineering. SpaceX's unique data domain and Starlink upside must compensate for illiquidity and intensity." Accept at $210K+ equity.
