### Technical Program Manager | SpaceX Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Mission-Driven Equity + Intensity Premium | $180B+ Private Valuation | Cross-Program Vehicle/Starlink Delivery | 60+ Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Hawthorne, CA | $155K-$205K | $110K-$280K | Performance | $205K-$355K |
| Starbase, TX | $145K-$195K | $110K-$280K | Performance | $195K-$345K |
| Redmond, WA | $155K-$205K | $110K-$280K | Performance | $205K-$355K |

**Negotiation DNA**

TPMs at SpaceX coordinate the most complex engineering programs on the planet: Starship development (the largest rocket ever built), Falcon 9 launch cadence (100+ launches/year), Starlink constellation deployment (5,000+ satellites), and Dragon crew missions to the ISS. SpaceX TPMs manage across hardware, software, manufacturing, and operations -- a scope that dwarfs typical tech TPM roles. You coordinate between Hawthorne (HQ), Starbase (Starship), Redmond (Starlink), McGregor (engine testing), and Cape Canaveral (launches). Program delivery has physical consequences: schedule slips delay national security missions or ISS crew rotations. SpaceX TPMs are expected to be technically deep enough to challenge engineers and fast enough to match the company's legendary iteration speed. [Source: SpaceX TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** SpaceX TPM = Google L5-L6 TPM = Amazon Senior TPM -- but with hardware-software-manufacturing scope and launch operations

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Hardware-Software-Manufacturing Scope:** "I coordinate across hardware, software, manufacturing, and launch operations. This cross-domain scope doesn't exist at software-only companies."
- **Physical Consequence Delivery:** "Schedule slips delay national security missions and crew flights. My program delivery has consequences measured in national security and astronaut safety."
- **Multi-Site Coordination:** "I coordinate across 5+ sites (Hawthorne, Starbase, Redmond, McGregor, Cape). Multi-site, multi-domain program management is extraordinarily complex."

**Global Levers**

1. **Most Complex Programs:** "Starship is the most complex engineering program in history -- hardware, software, manufacturing, and operations across 5+ sites. My TPM scope is unmatched."
2. **Launch Cadence Delivery:** "I manage programs that directly enable 100+ launches/year. Each launched delayed costs SpaceX $50M+ in revenue."
3. **National Security Program Delivery:** "My programs deliver vehicles for DOD and NASA missions. Program delivery has national security and human spaceflight consequences."
4. **Cross-Domain Program Management:** "Hardware + software + manufacturing + operations TPM skills are extraordinarily rare and valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage the most complex engineering programs in the world -- Starship development, 100+ launch cadence, and Starlink constellation deployment across 5+ sites. Each program delay costs $50M+ in revenue or delays national security missions. I'm targeting $260K in equity over 4 years. My competing TPM offer from [Google/Amazon] is $310K total comp for software-only programs. SpaceX's cross-domain program complexity and equity upside must compensate." Accept at $225K+ equity.
