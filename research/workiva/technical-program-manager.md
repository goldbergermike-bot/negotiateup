**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Workiva coordinate the delivery of compliance platform features that enterprises depend on for regulatory obligations. TPMs manage programs that span the connected reporting platform — from document editing and data integration to compliance workflows and ESG reporting. The regulatory calendar adds unique program management complexity: SEC filing deadlines, audit seasons, and regulatory rule changes create hard deadlines that cannot slip.

Workiva compensates TPMs competitively within the GRC technology sector. The role benefits from the criticality of on-time delivery in compliance software — when Workiva misses a feature release needed for a new regulatory requirement, customers face compliance risk. This urgency gives effective TPMs significant organizational influence and justifies premium compensation for those who can navigate the complexity.

TPMs at Workiva need both technical credibility and regulatory awareness. Understanding the compliance calendar (when SEC filings are due, when CSRD takes effect, when audit seasons peak) helps TPMs plan and prioritize effectively. TPMs who can communicate with both engineering teams and compliance-focused product managers are most effective.

**Workiva Regulatory Delivery Premium**
TPMs who bring experience managing delivery for compliance or regulated software products have particular leverage. The regulatory calendar creates immovable deadlines — if a new SEC reporting requirement takes effect on January 1, Workiva's features must be ready before that date. TPMs who understand this constraint and can manage toward regulatory deadlines (not just internal release dates) bring directly transferable value.

TPMs with experience managing remote-first engineering teams are valuable at Workiva, where the distributed workforce requires program management practices that work without relying on in-person coordination.

**Global Levers**
1. **Regulatory Delivery Experience:** "I've managed delivery for [compliance/regulated] software products where regulatory deadlines are immovable. This experience directly maps to Workiva's compliance calendar-driven development."
2. **Remote Program Management:** "I've managed complex programs across distributed teams. Workiva's remote-first culture requires TPMs who can drive alignment and execution without relying on in-person meetings."
3. **Cross-Functional Coordination:** "I've coordinated delivery across [X] teams with [Y] dependencies at [company]. Workiva's platform complexity requires exactly this multi-team program management capability."
4. **Technical Credibility:** "I combine program management with genuine technical depth in [area]. TPMs who can engage credibly with architects on trade-offs are more effective program leaders."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my experience managing [compliance software/regulated product] delivery programs, I'm targeting total compensation of $218K. TPMs who understand regulatory delivery constraints and can drive cross-team execution in a remote environment are rare. My floor is $198K in total comp. I'd welcome additional RSUs and a sign-on bonus to facilitate the transition."
