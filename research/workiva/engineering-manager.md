**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Workiva lead teams building the compliance and reporting platform that thousands of enterprises depend on for regulatory obligations. An EM at Workiva typically manages 6-12 engineers and owns delivery for product areas within the connected reporting platform — whether that's the document editing engine, data connectors, compliance workflow automation, ESG reporting features, or the platform infrastructure. The role requires understanding both the technical challenges of building collaborative document platforms and the regulatory domain that drives product requirements.

Workiva compensates EMs competitively for the GRC technology sector, with total comp ranging from $192K-$350K depending on location and level. While lower than FAANG EM compensation in absolute terms, the purchasing power in Ames, Denver, or remote settings is substantial. Workiva's culture emphasizes sustainable leadership — EMs are not expected to drive 80-hour weeks, and the company values managers who build healthy, productive teams.

Workiva's engineering organization has grown significantly as the company expands its platform capabilities, particularly in ESG reporting and AI-powered compliance features. EMs who can build and retain strong engineering teams in a competitive market — particularly for remote roles where Workiva competes with Bay Area remote comp — are highly valued.

**Workiva GRC Leadership Premium**
Engineering Managers who bring experience in regulated technology domains — financial services, healthcare IT, or compliance/audit technology — have strong leverage. Understanding the regulatory context helps EMs make better product prioritization decisions, communicate more effectively with product management, and build teams that appreciate the significance of compliance software quality (bugs in compliance software can have legal consequences for customers).

EMs with experience leading remote-first engineering teams are particularly valued, as Workiva's distributed workforce requires managers who can build culture, maintain velocity, and develop talent without relying on in-office proximity.

**Global Levers**
1. **Regulated Domain Leadership:** "I've led engineering teams in [regulated technology domain] where software quality has legal and compliance implications. This experience directly maps to the stakes of building Workiva's compliance platform."
2. **Remote Team Building:** "I've built and managed high-performing remote engineering teams of [X] people. At Workiva, where remote-first is the norm, this remote leadership experience ensures I can maintain team cohesion and productivity."
3. **Talent Retention in Competitive Market:** "I've maintained [X%] retention rate by [specific practices]. In a market where remote engineers have abundant options, my retention skills protect Workiva's investment in talent."
4. **Growth-Stage Scaling:** "I've led teams through [growth phase] at [company], scaling from [X] to [Y] engineers while maintaining delivery velocity. Workiva's growth trajectory requires EMs who can scale teams effectively."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my experience leading [team size] engineers in [regulated technology/compliance domain], I'm targeting total compensation of $295K. Engineering Managers who understand both engineering leadership and regulatory compliance context are rare. My floor is $270K in total comp. I'd welcome a strong RSU component given Workiva's GRC market position, and a sign-on bonus to offset any compensation gap."
