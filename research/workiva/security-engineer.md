**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Workiva protect a platform that processes the most sensitive corporate data in existence — SEC filings before public release, internal audit findings, SOX control documentation, and non-public financial information. The security stakes are extraordinary: a breach of pre-release SEC filings would constitute material non-public information leakage with criminal insider-trading implications. This existential risk creates genuine leverage for security professionals who can protect Workiva's platform.

Workiva compensates Security Engineers at a premium over standard engineering roles, typically 10-15% higher, reflecting the scarcity of security talent and the critical nature of the role. The company maintains SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and FedRAMP certifications, and security engineers are responsible for maintaining these certifications while keeping pace with platform evolution.

The security challenges at Workiva are distinctive: protecting multi-tenant document collaboration in real-time, ensuring data isolation between competing enterprises who both use the platform, implementing role-based access controls for sensitive financial data, and building security monitoring for a platform where the consequences of failure include securities law violations.

**Workiva Financial Data Protection Premium**
Security Engineers with experience protecting financial data — MNPI (material non-public information) controls, financial data classification, insider trading prevention systems, or SEC filing security — have exceptional leverage at Workiva. Few security professionals have experience with the specific regulatory requirements around financial data protection, and those who do command significant premiums.

Engineers with experience in compliance-driven security programs — building and maintaining SOC 2, FedRAMP, or ISO 27001 certifications — have additional leverage because these certifications are prerequisites for Workiva's enterprise customers. If you can automate compliance evidence collection and security control monitoring, you directly reduce Workiva's audit costs and accelerate the compliance cycle.

**Global Levers**
1. **Financial Data Security:** "I bring experience protecting [MNPI/sensitive financial data/regulatory documents]. The security stakes at Workiva — protecting pre-release SEC filings — require this specialized knowledge."
2. **Compliance Certification Experience:** "I've led or contributed to [SOC 2/FedRAMP/ISO 27001] certification programs. This directly reduces Workiva's compliance burden and enables enterprise sales."
3. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers are in short supply nationally, and those with financial data protection experience are even rarer. This scarcity justifies premium compensation regardless of office location."
4. **Multi-Tenant Security Expertise:** "I've built security controls for multi-tenant SaaS platforms where data isolation between competing customers is critical. This directly maps to Workiva's architecture."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Given my expertise in [financial data security/compliance platform protection/regulatory security], I'm targeting total compensation of $222K. Security engineers who understand the specific risks of protecting pre-release financial data are in exceptional demand. My floor is $202K in total comp. I'd welcome additional RSUs and a sign-on bonus to facilitate the transition."
