**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Workiva own the strategy and execution for compliance and reporting products that enterprises depend on for regulatory obligations. PMs here make decisions that directly affect how Fortune 500 companies file with the SEC, manage SOX compliance, produce ESG reports, and coordinate audit workflows. The regulatory domain adds a unique dimension to product management — PMs must understand evolving regulations (SEC rules, CSRD, ISSB standards) and translate them into product requirements that help customers comply efficiently.

Workiva compensates PMs in line with its Midwest-headquartered cost structure while remaining competitive for the GRC sector. The total comp of $150K-$268K provides strong purchasing power in Workiva's primary markets. The company values PMs who combine product instincts with regulatory domain knowledge — this combination is rare and commands premium positioning within Workiva's bands.

Workiva's PM culture is collaborative and customer-driven. PMs work closely with customers (compliance officers, controllers, audit directors) who are deeply knowledgeable about their domain and have specific requirements driven by regulatory obligations. PMs who can build productive relationships with these expert users and translate their needs into scalable platform features thrive at Workiva.

**Workiva ESG & Regulatory Product Premium**
Product Managers who bring direct experience with compliance software, regulatory reporting, or GRC platforms have the strongest negotiating position. The domain knowledge required to make effective product decisions for SEC filings, SOX compliance, or ESG reporting takes years to develop, and PMs who arrive with this expertise can contribute to product strategy immediately rather than spending months learning the regulatory landscape.

PMs with experience in the rapidly growing ESG reporting market are in particularly high demand. The EU CSRD, SEC climate disclosures, and ISSB standards are creating massive new compliance workloads, and Workiva needs PMs who understand these frameworks and can build products that help enterprises comply.

**Global Levers**
1. **Regulatory Domain Expertise:** "I bring direct experience with [SEC reporting/SOX compliance/ESG reporting] product management. PMs who understand regulatory requirements and can translate them into product features are rare and immediately impactful."
2. **ESG Market Knowledge:** "My experience in [ESG reporting/sustainability data/CSRD compliance] aligns with Workiva's fastest-growing market. I can define ESG product features from day one."
3. **Customer Empathy:** "I've worked directly with [compliance officers/auditors/controllers] at [company]. Understanding these personas' workflows and pain points is essential for effective GRC product management."
4. **National PM Rates:** "Product Managers with GRC domain expertise command national rates. I'd like the offer to reflect the specialized nature of compliance product management."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my product management experience in [GRC/compliance technology/ESG reporting] and my track record of [measurable product outcome], I'm targeting total compensation of $228K. PMs who combine product skills with regulatory domain knowledge are rare and directly impact Workiva's product-market fit. My floor is $208K in total comp. I'd welcome a stronger RSU component and a sign-on bonus."
