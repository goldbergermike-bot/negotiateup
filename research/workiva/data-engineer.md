**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Workiva build the data infrastructure that powers compliance and reporting for thousands of enterprises. The platform processes highly sensitive financial and regulatory data — SEC filings, audit evidence, sustainability metrics, and internal controls documentation — requiring data pipelines that are not only performant but also auditable, tamper-evident, and compliant with regulatory requirements. This is not standard data engineering; every pipeline must maintain complete data lineage and provenance for audit purposes.

Workiva's compensation reflects its Midwest roots and $5B market cap, with Data Engineer packages lower than Bay Area peers but competitive for the GRC/compliance technology sector. The remote-first policy means you can access Workiva compensation from anywhere in the US, and the purchasing power in lower cost-of-living areas can exceed what Bay Area salaries provide. The company offers strong benefits including generous PTO, employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), and a collaborative, sustainable-pace culture.

The data engineering challenges at Workiva are genuinely interesting: multi-tenant data isolation for sensitive regulatory data, real-time data synchronization for collaborative document editing, regulatory data connectors that map diverse source systems to compliance frameworks, and increasingly, AI-ready data pipelines for automated compliance checking and report generation.

**Workiva Compliance Data Premium**
Data Engineers who bring experience with compliance data — audit trail implementation, data lineage tracking, or regulatory data transformation — have particular leverage at Workiva. The company's data engineering challenges are fundamentally different from consumer analytics: compliance data must be immutable, auditable, and traceable, with strict retention and access control requirements. Engineers who understand these constraints build better pipelines faster.

If you bring experience with financial data processing, XBRL data handling, or ESG data collection and normalization, these skills directly support Workiva's product roadmap. The growing complexity of regulatory requirements (SEC modernization, CSRD, ISSB standards) means Data Engineers who can build flexible, extensible data pipelines for evolving compliance frameworks are particularly valuable.

**Global Levers**
1. **Compliance Data Expertise:** "I bring experience building data pipelines for [financial/regulatory/audit] data with strict lineage and auditability requirements. This directly maps to Workiva's core data engineering challenges."
2. **Regulatory Data Processing:** "My experience with [XBRL/financial data/ESG metrics] processing means I understand the domain-specific data quality and transformation requirements that compliance data demands."
3. **National Market Rates:** "While I appreciate Workiva's Midwest-based compensation, data engineers with compliance data expertise command national market rates. I'd like the offer to reflect the specialized nature of this skillset."
4. **Remote Work Productivity:** "I'm highly productive in remote environments and bring experience building data infrastructure in distributed teams. Workiva's remote culture aligns with my working style."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "With my data engineering experience in [compliance data/financial data/regulatory data], I'm targeting total compensation of $195K. Data Engineers who understand the auditability and lineage requirements of compliance data are rare. My floor is $180K in total comp. I'd welcome a stronger RSU component given Workiva's growth in the GRC market, and a sign-on bonus to offset any transition gap."
