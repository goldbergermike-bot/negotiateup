**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Workiva build and maintain the connected reporting platform that thousands of enterprises rely on for regulatory compliance. As an SWE at Workiva, you contribute to features across the platform — document editing, data connectors, compliance workflows, collaboration features, reporting templates, or infrastructure services. The engineering challenges are real and meaningful: building reliable, auditable software that helps companies meet legal obligations.

Workiva's base SWE compensation reflects its Ames, Iowa headquarters and Midwest-oriented cost structure. Total comp of $130K-$232K is lower than Bay Area peers in absolute terms but provides excellent purchasing power in Workiva's primary markets. The remote-first policy means you can access this compensation from anywhere in the US, and the company offers strong benefits including generous PTO, ESPP, 401(k) matching, and a culture that genuinely values work-life balance.

Workiva's tech stack is modern and developer-friendly: Go for backend services, TypeScript/React for frontend, Python for data processing, AWS for cloud infrastructure, and Kubernetes for orchestration. The engineering culture emphasizes code quality, testing, and sustainable development practices. For early-to-mid career engineers, Workiva provides the opportunity to work on enterprise-grade software in a supportive environment with strong mentorship.

**Workiva Platform Premium**
Software Engineers who bring experience with collaborative editing systems, document processing, or enterprise SaaS architecture can negotiate above standard bands. Workiva's platform has unique technical requirements — real-time multi-user editing with audit trails, data integration with enterprise financial systems, and regulatory-grade data quality — that not all engineers have experience with.

Engineers with Go language proficiency have an advantage, as Workiva's backend is heavily Go-based. If you also bring React expertise for the frontend, you match Workiva's full-stack requirements and can contribute across the platform.

**Global Levers**
1. **Modern Stack Alignment:** "I bring hands-on experience with [Go/TypeScript/React/AWS] which maps directly to Workiva's tech stack. This means immediate productivity without tooling ramp-up."
2. **Remote Work Effectiveness:** "I'm highly effective in remote settings with a track record of [specific outcomes]. Workiva's remote-first culture aligns with my working style."
3. **Enterprise SaaS Experience:** "My experience building [enterprise SaaS/multi-tenant platforms] means I understand the reliability and security standards that Workiva's enterprise customers demand."
4. **Multiple Offer Leverage:** "I'm evaluating offers from [comparable companies] at $X. Workiva's product domain and culture are appealing, and a competitive offer would help me decide."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my engineering experience with [Go/enterprise SaaS/relevant technologies] and my competing offers at $X, I'm targeting total compensation of $190K. I understand Workiva's compensation philosophy, but engineers with relevant enterprise platform experience should be positioned at the upper end of the band. My floor is $175K in total comp, and I'm open to creative structuring through additional RSUs or a sign-on bonus."
