**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Workiva maintain the cloud infrastructure that enterprises depend on for their most critical regulatory filings. When Workiva's platform has downtime during SEC filing season or audit season, customers face real regulatory penalties and reputational damage. This criticality means DevOps engineers must build infrastructure that is not only reliable but also auditable — every deployment, configuration change, and access event must be logged and traceable for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and FedRAMP compliance.

Workiva's compensation for DevOps Engineers reflects its Midwest-based cost structure while remaining competitive for the GRC technology sector. The remote-first policy expands the effective compensation by allowing engineers to work from lower cost-of-living areas. Benefits are strong, including generous PTO, ESPP, and a culture that genuinely respects work-life balance — rare in the DevOps/SRE world where on-call can be demanding.

The tech stack is modern: AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, and observability with Datadog. Workiva has invested in infrastructure modernization, and DevOps engineers work with contemporary tools rather than maintaining legacy infrastructure. The compliance overlay adds an interesting dimension — building infrastructure that is both agile and audit-ready is a genuine engineering challenge.

**Workiva Compliance Infrastructure Premium**
DevOps Engineers who bring experience with compliance-certified cloud infrastructure — SOC 2 Type II, FedRAMP, ISO 27001 — have direct leverage because these certifications are prerequisites for Workiva's enterprise customers. Engineers who can build infrastructure-as-code that passes compliance audits automatically, rather than requiring manual remediation, provide significant operational value.

Engineers with experience in regulated industries (financial services, healthcare, government) bring understanding of the controls and processes that compliance-grade infrastructure requires. If you've built infrastructure that supports audit trails, immutable logging, and evidence collection, these skills directly map to Workiva's operational requirements.

**Global Levers**
1. **Compliance-Ready Infrastructure:** "I bring experience building cloud infrastructure that maintains [SOC 2/FedRAMP/ISO 27001] compliance continuously, not just at audit time. This reduces risk and operational cost for Workiva's compliance posture."
2. **Regulated Industry Experience:** "My DevOps experience in [financial services/healthcare/government] means I understand the infrastructure controls that regulated environments demand. I won't need to learn these requirements on the job."
3. **Infrastructure Automation:** "I've automated [X%] of infrastructure operations at [company], reducing deployment time by [Y%] while maintaining compliance. This efficiency directly supports Workiva's platform reliability and development velocity."
4. **Remote DevOps Effectiveness:** "I'm experienced with distributed infrastructure operations and remote on-call practices. My ability to maintain reliability from a remote setting aligns with Workiva's remote-first culture."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "With my experience building [compliance-certified/regulated-industry] cloud infrastructure, I'm targeting total compensation of $192K. DevOps engineers who can build audit-ready infrastructure that supports regulatory compliance platforms are in specialized demand. My floor is $175K in total comp. I'd welcome a stronger RSU grant given Workiva's market growth, and a sign-on bonus to offset any transition gap."
