**Negotiation DNA**
The Compliance Platform Engineer is Workiva's most strategically important technical role. Workiva's entire business is built on helping enterprises manage regulatory compliance — SEC filings, SOX compliance, ESG reporting, and audit management — through its connected reporting platform. Engineers in this role build the core compliance workflow engine, regulatory data connectors, and audit-trail infrastructure that Fortune 500 companies depend on for their most sensitive reporting obligations. When Workiva's platform has issues, companies miss regulatory deadlines with real legal and financial consequences.

Workiva's $5B market cap and Ames, Iowa headquarters mean lower cost-of-living-adjusted compensation compared to Bay Area companies. However, the company's remote-first work policy and Midwestern efficiency culture mean you can earn a competitive salary while enjoying a significantly lower cost of living. Total comp of $155K-$235K in Ames or remote positions often provides more purchasing power than $250K+ in San Francisco.

The negotiation leverage for Compliance Platform Engineers lies in the extreme specialization of the role. Engineers who understand both regulatory compliance frameworks (SEC regulations, SOX requirements, ESG reporting standards, XBRL) and modern software engineering are rare. Most engineers don't choose to learn securities regulation, and most compliance experts don't have engineering skills. If you bridge this gap, you occupy a niche that Workiva cannot easily fill.

**Workiva Regulatory Compliance Premium**
Engineers who bring direct experience with regulatory compliance technology — SEC EDGAR filing systems, XBRL tagging, SOX control frameworks, or ESG data collection and reporting (GRI, SASB, TCFD, CSRD) — command a significant premium at Workiva. The regulatory landscape is becoming more complex every year, particularly with the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the SEC's climate disclosure rules creating enormous new compliance workloads. Engineers who understand these regulations and can build automation tools for them are directly tied to Workiva's revenue growth.

The ESG reporting boom is Workiva's biggest growth driver. If you bring experience with sustainability data management, carbon accounting platforms, or ESG reporting frameworks, you're aligned with Workiva's highest-growth market segment. Additionally, engineers with experience building real-time collaboration features (similar to Google Docs) bring relevant skills for Workiva's connected reporting platform.

**Global Levers**
1. **Regulatory Domain Expertise:** "I bring both engineering skills and understanding of [SEC regulations/SOX/ESG reporting frameworks]. Engineers who can translate regulatory requirements into software features are exceptionally rare and directly tied to Workiva's product-market fit."
2. **ESG Growth Alignment:** "My experience with [sustainability data/ESG reporting/CSRD compliance] aligns with Workiva's fastest-growing market segment. I can contribute to ESG platform features from day one, which has direct revenue implications."
3. **Cost-of-Living Advantage:** "While I understand Workiva's Midwest-based compensation philosophy, I'd like the offer to reflect the market for compliance technology engineers nationally, not just locally. My skills are nationally scarce regardless of my location."
4. **Remote Work Value Exchange:** "I'm excited about Workiva's remote-first culture. In exchange for the flexibility, I'm willing to accept a moderate location adjustment, but the total comp still needs to be competitive with remote roles at comparable GRC/compliance companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Given my specialized expertise in [regulatory compliance technology/ESG data automation/SEC reporting systems], I'm targeting total compensation of $225K. Engineers who bridge compliance domain knowledge and modern software engineering are in the top percentile of scarcity for Workiva's hiring needs. My floor is $205K in total comp. I'm open to creative structuring — additional RSUs to align with Workiva's growth, or a sign-on bonus to bridge any compensation gap from my current role."
