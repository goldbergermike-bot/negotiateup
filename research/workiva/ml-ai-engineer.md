**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Workiva are building the intelligence layer for the company's compliance and reporting platform. This includes AI-powered document review and generation, automated compliance checking against regulatory frameworks, anomaly detection in financial data, NLP for extracting information from regulatory filings, and increasingly, generative AI features that help users draft and review compliance documents. The regulatory domain provides unique ML challenges — models must be highly accurate because errors in compliance documents have legal consequences.

Workiva has been rapidly expanding its AI capabilities, recognizing that AI-powered compliance automation is the next major value driver for the platform. This investment creates strong demand for ML/AI engineers, and Workiva is willing to pay above its standard engineering bands (typically 15-25% premium) to attract AI talent. The company competes with larger tech companies for ML engineers, and has been increasing compensation for AI roles specifically.

The unique appeal for ML/AI engineers is the combination of rich compliance datasets, clear product impact (every model improvement helps customers meet regulatory obligations more efficiently), and the opportunity to work on document AI problems in a high-stakes domain where accuracy is paramount. If you're interested in applying ML to real-world business problems with measurable impact, Workiva provides a compelling environment.

**Workiva Compliance AI Premium**
ML/AI Engineers with expertise in document AI for financial and regulatory text are in the strongest negotiating position. Workiva's AI challenges involve processing financial statements, regulatory filings, audit reports, and ESG disclosures — documents that require higher accuracy than general-purpose NLP. If you've built NLP models for financial or legal text, document classification systems for regulated industries, or automated review tools for compliance documents, your skills directly map to Workiva's highest-priority AI initiatives.

Engineers with experience in responsible AI — building ML systems that are explainable, auditable, and reliable for high-stakes decisions — have additional leverage. In compliance contexts, AI decisions must be traceable and explainable to auditors and regulators, which requires ML engineering approaches that go beyond optimizing accuracy metrics.

**Global Levers**
1. **Compliance AI Specialization:** "I bring ML expertise specifically applied to [financial documents/regulatory text/compliance automation]. AI engineers who understand the accuracy and explainability requirements of compliance applications are rare."
2. **Document AI Experience:** "My experience with [document understanding/NLP for financial text/automated document review] directly addresses Workiva's core AI product challenges."
3. **AI Market Premium:** "ML/AI engineers command a 20-30% premium over standard engineering roles in today's market. Even at a Midwest-headquartered company, AI talent must be compensated at national rates."
4. **Responsible AI Expertise:** "I bring experience building [explainable/auditable/responsible] AI systems. In compliance contexts, AI decisions must be traceable — this is not optional. My responsible AI expertise reduces risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Given my expertise in [compliance AI/document NLP/financial text understanding], I'm targeting total compensation of $240K. ML engineers who can build accurate, explainable AI features for regulatory compliance platforms are in exceptional demand. My floor is $218K in total comp. I'd welcome a stronger RSU allocation given Workiva's growth in AI-powered compliance, and a sign-on bonus of $15K-$25K."
