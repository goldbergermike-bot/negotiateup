**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Workiva own the design and implementation of critical features within the connected reporting platform. Whether building the real-time collaborative editing engine, designing data connector architectures that pull financial data from ERP systems, implementing compliance workflow automation, or developing ESG reporting features, Seniors make the technical decisions that determine platform quality and reliability. The stakes are high — Workiva's customers use the platform for legally required regulatory filings, and system failures or data errors have real legal and financial consequences.

Workiva compensates Senior SWEs at approximately 25-30% above its base SWE band, with total comp of $162K-$292K depending on location. This is competitive within the GRC technology sector and for remote-first positions, though below Bay Area-headquartered companies at similar revenue scale. The purchasing power advantage of Workiva's primary markets significantly narrows this gap.

Senior Engineers at Workiva benefit from a modern tech stack (Go, Python, TypeScript, React, AWS, Kubernetes), interesting technical challenges (real-time collaboration, regulatory data processing, multi-tenant security), and a culture that values work-life balance and sustainable pace. The career trajectory is strong, with clear paths to Staff Engineer or Engineering Manager roles.

**Workiva Connected Reporting Premium**
Senior Engineers who bring experience with real-time collaborative systems (operational transform or CRDT algorithms), document processing engines, or multi-tenant SaaS architecture have strong leverage. Workiva's connected reporting platform shares technical DNA with Google Docs — multiple users simultaneously editing documents with real-time synchronization — but adds the complexity of regulatory compliance, data lineage, and audit trail requirements.

Engineers with experience in financial data integration (connecting to SAP, Oracle, Workday, and other enterprise systems) bring domain-relevant skills that accelerate Workiva's product development. If you've built ETL pipelines or integration connectors for enterprise financial systems, this experience is directly transferable.

**Global Levers**
1. **Collaborative Systems Expertise:** "I bring experience building real-time collaborative editing systems using [OT/CRDTs/conflict resolution algorithms]. This directly maps to Workiva's connected reporting platform architecture."
2. **Enterprise Integration Experience:** "I've built integration connectors for [SAP/Oracle/Workday] financial systems. This experience accelerates Workiva's ability to connect customer data sources to the compliance platform."
3. **Full-Stack Senior Capability:** "I contribute across the full stack — backend services, API design, and frontend features. At Workiva's size, full-stack Senior Engineers have outsized productivity impact."
4. **Remote Senior Track Record:** "I've been a highly effective senior engineer in remote settings, delivering [specific outcomes]. My remote effectiveness aligns with Workiva's distributed engineering culture."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "With my senior engineering experience in [collaborative systems/enterprise data integration/compliance platforms], I'm targeting total compensation of $242K. Senior engineers who understand both modern platform architecture and the regulatory domain are in high demand. My floor is $222K in total comp. I'd welcome a stronger RSU component given Workiva's market growth, and a sign-on bonus to offset any transition gap."
