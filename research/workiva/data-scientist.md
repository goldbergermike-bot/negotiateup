**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Workiva analyze and model the compliance and reporting data that flows through the platform — financial statements, audit findings, ESG metrics, internal controls, and regulatory submissions. The analytical opportunities are distinctive: building models to detect compliance anomalies, predict filing risks, optimize audit workflows, and quantify ESG performance. Few companies have access to the breadth and depth of regulatory compliance data that Workiva processes.

Workiva compensates Data Scientists competitively within the GRC technology sector, with packages that reflect the company's Midwest-based cost structure. Total comp is lower than Bay Area peers in absolute terms but provides strong purchasing power in Ames, Denver, and other Workiva locations. The remote-first policy allows Data Scientists to access Workiva's analytical challenges from anywhere.

The role is evolving rapidly as Workiva invests in AI and machine learning. Data Scientists increasingly contribute to product-embedded intelligence — automated compliance checking, anomaly detection in financial data, and predictive models for regulatory risk — rather than purely internal analytics. This product integration creates career growth opportunities and potential for higher compensation as AI becomes more central to Workiva's platform.

**Workiva Regulatory Analytics Premium**
Data Scientists who bring expertise in financial analytics — audit analytics, financial statement analysis, fraud detection, or regulatory compliance modeling — have specialized leverage at Workiva. The company's dataset includes patterns across thousands of enterprises' compliance workflows, and Data Scientists who can extract predictive insights from this data directly enhance the platform's value proposition.

If you bring experience with ESG data analysis, sustainability metrics modeling, or carbon accounting analytics, you're aligned with Workiva's fastest-growing data science needs. The EU CSRD and SEC climate disclosure rules are creating demand for sophisticated ESG analytics that Workiva is positioning to serve.
