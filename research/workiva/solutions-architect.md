**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Workiva design the enterprise compliance architectures that help the world's largest companies implement connected reporting. The role requires understanding Workiva's platform capabilities deeply while also understanding each customer's unique regulatory landscape, existing technology ecosystem (SAP, Oracle, Workday integrations), and organizational compliance processes. SAs work directly with CFOs, controllers, compliance officers, and IT directors to design solutions that streamline regulatory reporting.

Workiva compensates Solutions Architects at levels that reflect both the technical complexity and the revenue influence of the role. SAs are involved in Workiva's largest enterprise deals, and their solution designs directly determine deal outcomes and customer success. The role requires a rare combination of compliance domain expertise, technical architecture skills, and executive communication ability.

The career trajectory for SAs at Workiva is strong, with paths to Principal Architect, Customer Success leadership, or Product Management. The company values SAs who develop deep domain expertise in specific compliance areas (SEC reporting, SOX, ESG) and become trusted advisors to enterprise customers.

**Workiva Compliance Architecture Premium**
Solutions Architects who bring direct compliance domain expertise — SEC filing workflows, SOX control frameworks, ESG reporting architectures, or audit management systems — have exceptional leverage. The ability to design Workiva implementations that align with specific regulatory requirements, rather than generic SaaS deployments, is what distinguishes a great Workiva SA from a good one.

SAs with experience integrating compliance platforms with enterprise ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, Workday) and financial data sources bring critical skills for Workiva's enterprise customers. Most large enterprises have complex data landscapes, and SAs who can design data flows from source systems through Workiva's platform to regulatory outputs create the most value.
