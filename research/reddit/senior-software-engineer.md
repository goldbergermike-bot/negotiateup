| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Reddit Senior Software Engineers own the technical architecture of systems serving 100M+ DAU — feed ranking algorithms, real-time messaging infrastructure, community moderation tools, ad targeting systems, and the API platform that powers Reddit's data licensing revenue. At the senior level, you're making architectural decisions that directly impact Reddit's revenue trajectory and platform reliability. The $1B share buyback makes RSU-heavy packages the optimal negotiation strategy. [Source: Reddit Sr SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As a Senior Software Engineer making architectural decisions that drive revenue, I want significantly more RSUs. Reddit's $1B buyback tells me management believes the stock is undervalued — and the buyback creates a liquidity floor by reducing float. I'm asking for an additional $40K-$65K in RSU grants over 4 years. The buyback de-risks my equity compensation while my architectural work directly drives the revenue growth that increases share value." Push for RSU-heavy packages — argue that senior engineers create the most direct value-to-stock-price connection.

**Global Levers**

1. **$1B Buyback — RSU Liquidity Floor:** "Reddit's $1B buyback creates a price floor for my RSUs. At the senior level, my architectural decisions directly drive revenue — and the buyback signals management agrees the stock is undervalued. Shift $35K-$50K from cash to RSUs."
2. **Post-IPO Profitability — Senior Impact:** "Reddit hit profitability and announced a $1B buyback. As a senior engineer, my technical decisions on ad targeting, feed ranking, and platform reliability directly drove this outcome. My compensation should reflect senior-level impact on profitability."
3. **100M+ DAU Architecture Ownership:** "I own the architecture of systems serving 100M+ DAU. Feed ranking, real-time messaging, and ad delivery at this scale require senior engineers who can make the right trade-offs under load."
4. **Data Licensing Technical Strategy:** "Reddit's data licensing deals generate significant revenue. My senior engineering decisions on API architecture, content systems, and data quality directly increase the value of these partnerships."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $242K base and $258K RSUs over 4 years for this Senior Software Engineer role. Reddit's $1B buyback creates a liquidity floor — I want an equity-heavy package because management is signaling undervaluation. My architectural work on feed ranking and ad systems directly drives the revenue growth supporting that buyback. I have competing offers from [Snap at $315K TC / Pinterest at $328K TC / Discord at $322K TC]. Reddit's buyback upside is unique — but RSUs must reflect senior-level impact." Accept at $225K+ base and $228K+ RSUs.
