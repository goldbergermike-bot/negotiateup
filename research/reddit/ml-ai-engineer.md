**Negotiation DNA**

Reddit ML/AI Engineers build the machine learning systems that power Reddit's highest-value capabilities — feed ranking, ad targeting, content recommendation, community health detection, and the conversational AI features transforming how users discover and engage with content. Your ML models directly determine the metrics that drive Reddit's revenue: time-on-platform, ad click-through rates, content quality, and user retention. The 15-25% AI Premium reflects the scarcity of ML talent and the outsized impact of ML on Reddit's business metrics. [Source: Reddit ML Comp 2025-2026]

**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As an ML/AI Engineer with the 15-25% AI Premium, I build the models that directly drive Reddit's engagement and ad revenue metrics. I want maximum RSU allocation — $268K+ over 4 years. Reddit's $1B buyback signals the stock is undervalued, and my ML models on feed ranking, ad targeting, and content recommendation are the single biggest lever on revenue growth. The buyback creates a liquidity floor, and my AI Premium reflects that ML engineering has the most direct impact on the metrics that drive share price. Every percentage improvement in feed ranking or ad targeting translates to millions in incremental revenue." Push for ML-premium RSU packages — the combination of AI scarcity premium and buyback upside makes this the optimal equity play.
