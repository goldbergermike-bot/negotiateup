**Negotiation DNA**

Reddit TPMs coordinate the cross-functional programs that drive Reddit's post-IPO growth — advertising platform launches, API partnership rollouts, platform migration programs, and the infrastructure scaling that supports 100M+ DAU. Your program management determines the velocity of Reddit's most revenue-critical initiatives, coordinating engineering, product, data science, and business teams to ship on time and at quality.

**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As a TPM, I coordinate the programs that ship Reddit's revenue features — ad platform launches, API partnerships, and platform scaling. I want more RSUs because Reddit's $1B buyback signals the stock is undervalued, and my program management directly determines the velocity of revenue feature delivery. I'm asking for an additional $20K-$30K in RSU grants. The buyback creates a liquidity floor, and my program execution ensures the revenue features keep shipping." Push for program-level RSU packages that reflect cross-functional delivery impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$1B Buyback — Program Velocity Drives Revenue:** "Reddit's $1B buyback depends on shipping revenue features — and I set the tempo. My program management on ad launches, API rollouts, and platform scaling determines how fast Reddit grows. RSUs should reflect program-level impact."
2. **Cross-Functional Revenue Programs:** "I coordinate engineering, product, data science, and business teams to ship Reddit's highest-priority programs. My cross-functional leadership directly accelerates revenue delivery."
3. **Post-IPO Execution Velocity:** "Reddit's post-IPO phase demands TPMs who can manage complex programs at the pace public markets expect. My program management ensures Reddit meets quarterly targets."
4. **Partnership Program Management:** "I manage the technical programs for Reddit's data licensing partnerships — coordinating API delivery, data quality, and integration timelines with Google, OpenAI, and others."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $208K base and $158K RSUs over 4 years for this TPM role. Reddit's $1B buyback creates a liquidity floor — and my program management on ad launches, API partnerships, and platform scaling directly determines how fast revenue features ship. I have competing offers from [Snap at $252K TC / Pinterest at $262K TC / Discord at $255K TC]. Reddit's buyback upside and my program velocity impact justify equity-heavy TPM comp." Accept at $192K+ base and $138K+ RSUs.
