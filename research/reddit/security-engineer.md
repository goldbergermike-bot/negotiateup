**Negotiation DNA**

Reddit Security Engineers protect one of the internet's most sensitive platforms — 100M+ DAU generating billions of user-generated content items, account credentials, voting systems, and the community trust infrastructure that makes Reddit valuable. Your security work protects against account takeovers, content manipulation, vote fraud, and the platform integrity attacks that could destroy Reddit's credibility with both users and advertisers. Post-IPO, security incidents directly impact stock price. [Source: Reddit Security Comp 2025-2026]

**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As a Security Engineer, I protect the platform integrity and user trust that Reddit's advertising revenue depends on. I want more RSUs — Reddit's $1B buyback signals the stock is undervalued, and my security work directly protects the brand trust that advertisers pay for. I'm asking for an additional $25K-$40K in RSU grants. A single major security incident could wipe billions from Reddit's market cap — my work is the insurance that protects the buyback's value." Push for security-level RSU packages that reflect risk-protection impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$1B Buyback — Security Protects Market Cap:** "Reddit's $1B buyback protects shareholder value — and my security engineering protects against incidents that could destroy that value. RSUs should reflect that I'm the insurance on Reddit's market cap."
2. **Post-IPO Security Stakes:** "As a public company, Reddit security incidents directly impact stock price. My work prevents the data breaches and platform integrity failures that could cost billions in market cap."
3. **Platform Integrity & Trust:** "Reddit's value comes from authentic user-generated content. My security work on vote fraud prevention, content manipulation detection, and account protection maintains the platform integrity that advertisers trust."
4. **100M+ DAU Data Protection:** "I protect the accounts and data of 100M+ daily active users. Reddit's security posture determines user trust, regulatory compliance, and advertiser confidence."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $235K base and $205K RSUs over 4 years for this Security Engineer role. Reddit's $1B buyback creates a liquidity floor — and my security engineering is the insurance that protects Reddit's market cap from incidents. I prevent data breaches, vote fraud, and platform integrity attacks for 100M+ DAU. I have competing offers from [Snap at $285K TC / Pinterest at $295K TC / Discord at $288K TC]. Reddit's post-IPO security stakes and buyback upside justify premium security comp." Accept at $218K+ base and $182K+ RSUs.
