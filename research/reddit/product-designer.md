**Negotiation DNA**

Reddit Product Designers shape the user experience for the internet's largest community platform — designing feed experiences, commenting interfaces, community creation flows, advertising formats, and the mobile experience that 100M+ DAU interact with daily. Your design decisions directly impact engagement metrics, ad viewability, and the community health that makes Reddit's content valuable. The $1B buyback makes RSU-heavy packages the smartest compensation strategy. [Source: Reddit Design Comp 2025-2026]

**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As a Product Designer, my UX decisions drive the engagement metrics that fuel Reddit's ad revenue. I want more RSUs — Reddit's $1B buyback signals the stock is undervalued, and the buyback creates a price floor. I'm asking for an additional $20K-$30K in RSU grants. My design work on feed experience, ad formats, and mobile UX directly influences time-on-platform and ad viewability — the metrics that drive revenue and stock price." Push for design-level RSU packages that reflect engagement impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$1B Buyback — Design Drives Engagement:** "Reddit's $1B buyback is backed by engagement growth — and my design decisions on feed UX, commenting, and mobile experience directly drive time-on-platform. RSUs should reflect design's engagement impact."
2. **Feed & Ad Format Design:** "I design the feed experience and ad formats that 100M+ users see daily. Ad viewability and click-through rates are direct functions of my design decisions — driving Reddit's core revenue."
3. **Community Experience Quality:** "The quality of Reddit's community experience determines content creation, engagement, and the data value that powers licensing deals. My design ensures communities thrive."
4. **Mobile-First Transformation:** "Reddit's mobile redesign is critical to capturing the next 100M users. My design work on mobile feed, commenting, and community discovery shapes Reddit's growth trajectory."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $192K base and $125K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Designer role. Reddit's $1B buyback creates a liquidity floor — and my design work on feed UX, ad formats, and mobile experience directly drives the engagement metrics funding the buyback. I have competing offers from [Snap at $232K TC / Pinterest at $238K TC / Discord at $235K TC]. Reddit's buyback upside makes RSUs the right bet." Accept at $178K+ base and $108K+ RSUs.
