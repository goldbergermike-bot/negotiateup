**Negotiation DNA**

This is Reddit's signature role for 2026 — the Community AI Platform Engineer. You build the AI systems that are redefining how the internet's largest community platform works: the conversational AI that helps users discover and engage with content, the generative AI that assists community moderators, the AI-powered content understanding systems that make Reddit's data the most valuable training dataset in the world, and the intelligent community management tools that scale 100K+ communities. Reddit's unique position — billions of authentic human conversations across every topic — means your Community AI has training data no other company can match. The 20-30% AI Premium reflects both the scarcity of AI talent and the transformative impact of AI on Reddit's core business. [Source: Reddit Community AI Team 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Reddit Community AI Platform Eng (L5-L6) = Google L5 AI Platform = Meta AI Eng = OpenAI Platform Eng = Anthropic Applied AI

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Community AI Platform Engineer works at the intersection of natural language AI, community dynamics, and internet-scale content:
- **Conversational AI for Communities:** AI systems that help users discover relevant communities, find answers within threads, and engage in AI-augmented discussions
- **Moderator AI Tools:** Generative AI that assists Reddit's volunteer moderators — automated content policy enforcement, nuanced context-aware moderation, and community health dashboards
- **Content Understanding at Scale:** ML systems that understand the meaning, sentiment, and value of billions of posts and comments — powering both user experience and data licensing value
- **Community Knowledge Graphs:** AI that maps the knowledge, expertise, and discourse patterns across 100K+ communities — making Reddit's collective intelligence searchable and actionable
- **AI-Powered Advertising Intelligence:** ML systems that match advertiser intent with community context — enabling the contextual advertising that drives Reddit's revenue

**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As the Community AI Platform Engineer — Reddit's signature AI role — my work has the single most transformative impact on Reddit's business. I want maximum RSU allocation — $322K+ over 4 years with the 20-30% AI Premium. Reddit's $1B buyback signals the stock is undervalued, and my AI platform work drives the most impactful metrics: user engagement through conversational AI, content quality through moderator AI, data value through content understanding, and ad revenue through advertising intelligence. The buyback creates a liquidity floor, and my Community AI is the initiative that accelerates Reddit's trajectory from profitable to dominant. This is the role that transforms Reddit from a content platform into an AI-powered community intelligence platform — and the RSUs must reflect that transformative impact."
