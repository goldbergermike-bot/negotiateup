### Engineering Manager | Reddit Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Community Platform & Digital Advertising | $1B Share Buyback (Feb 2026) | Post-IPO Growth

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Reddit Engineering Managers lead teams building the platform's highest-impact systems — advertising delivery, feed ranking, content moderation, community tools, and real-time infrastructure serving 100M+ DAU. At EM level, you own team velocity, technical quality, and the hiring pipeline that determines Reddit's engineering capacity during its critical post-IPO scaling phase. The $1B buyback creates the strongest equity negotiation environment for managers who directly control the teams driving revenue growth. [Source: Reddit EM Comp 2025-2026]

**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As an Engineering Manager, I control the team output that drives Reddit's revenue metrics. I want an equity-heavy package — $320K+ RSUs over 4 years. Reddit's $1B buyback signals the stock is undervalued, and my team's velocity on ad systems, feed ranking, and platform features directly determines the revenue growth that supports share price appreciation. The buyback creates a liquidity floor that de-risks my equity, and my management directly influences the engineering output that makes the company profitable." Push for manager-level RSU packages that reflect team-level revenue impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$1B Buyback — Team-Level RSU Impact:** "Reddit's $1B buyback creates a price floor — my team's output directly drives the revenue growth that funds it. I want $300K+ RSUs because I control the engineering velocity on Reddit's highest-revenue systems."
2. **Post-IPO Scaling Leadership:** "Reddit's post-IPO phase requires engineering managers who can scale teams, maintain quality, and accelerate revenue features. I build and lead the teams that execute Reddit's growth strategy."
3. **Hiring Pipeline Ownership:** "I own the hiring pipeline for Reddit's engineering organization. The quality of engineers I recruit and retain directly determines Reddit's competitive position and execution speed."
4. **Cross-Functional Revenue Impact:** "I partner with product, design, and data science to ship revenue-critical features. My team's execution on ad targeting, engagement features, and data infrastructure drives Reddit's profitability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $262K base and $322K RSUs over 4 years for this Engineering Manager role. Reddit's $1B buyback creates a liquidity floor — and as EM, my team's velocity on ad systems and engagement features directly drives the revenue growth that funds the buyback. I lead hiring, set technical direction, and execute Reddit's post-IPO growth strategy. I have competing offers from [Snap at $372K TC / Pinterest at $388K TC / Discord at $385K TC]. Reddit's buyback upside and my team-level revenue impact justify equity-heavy comp." Accept at $245K+ base and $288K+ RSUs.
