**Negotiation DNA**

Reddit Staff Software Engineers set the technical direction for entire platform domains — defining the architecture of Reddit's advertising engine, content recommendation systems, real-time infrastructure, and developer platform. At staff level, you're the technical authority whose decisions shape Reddit's revenue trajectory, platform scalability, and competitive positioning against Meta, Twitter/X, and TikTok. The $1B buyback makes this the optimal time to negotiate maximum RSU allocation. [Source: Reddit Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As a Staff Engineer setting technical direction for Reddit's revenue-critical systems, my work directly determines stock price trajectory. I want the maximum possible RSU allocation — $420K+ over 4 years. Reddit's $1B buyback tells me the company believes shares are undervalued, and the buyback creates a liquidity floor that de-risks my equity. At staff level, my architectural decisions on ad systems, feed ranking, and data infrastructure generate tens of millions in incremental revenue. The RSU package must reflect that my technical direction drives the profitability that funds the buyback." Push for $380K-$435K RSU grants — staff engineers have the strongest case for equity-heavy comp.
