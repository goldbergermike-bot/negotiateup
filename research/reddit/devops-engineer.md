**Negotiation DNA**

Reddit DevOps Engineers own the infrastructure reliability and deployment velocity for a platform serving 100M+ DAU across web, mobile, and API surfaces. Your work on CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes orchestration, observability systems, and incident response directly determines Reddit's uptime — and uptime equals ad revenue. Every minute of downtime costs Reddit ad impressions, and your infrastructure ensures the platform's reliability during peak traffic events that can spike 10-50x during viral moments.

**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As a DevOps Engineer, I ensure the uptime and deployment velocity that directly protect Reddit's ad revenue. I want more RSUs — Reddit's $1B buyback signals the stock is undervalued, and my infrastructure reliability ensures the platform generates the revenue that funds the buyback. I'm asking for an additional $20K-$30K in RSU grants. My CI/CD improvements, reliability engineering, and incident response directly protect millions in daily ad revenue." Push for infrastructure-level RSU packages that reflect reliability-to-revenue impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$1B Buyback — Uptime Protects Revenue:** "Reddit's $1B buyback depends on reliable ad revenue — and my DevOps work ensures 99.9%+ uptime for a 100M+ DAU platform. RSUs should reflect that my infrastructure reliability directly protects the revenue stream."
2. **Deployment Velocity — Feature Speed:** "I own the CI/CD pipeline that determines how fast Reddit ships features. Faster deployment means faster revenue feature releases — my infrastructure acceleration drives business velocity."
3. **100M+ DAU Scale Reliability:** "I maintain infrastructure serving 100M+ DAU with traffic spikes of 10-50x during viral events. This scale of reliability engineering is matched only by the largest social platforms."
4. **Cost Optimization — Profitability Impact:** "My infrastructure optimization directly reduces Reddit's cloud costs. Every dollar saved in infrastructure costs flows directly to the profitability that funds the $1B buyback."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $212K base and $168K RSUs over 4 years for this DevOps Engineer role. Reddit's $1B buyback creates a liquidity floor — and my infrastructure reliability directly protects the ad revenue funding the buyback. I ensure 99.9%+ uptime for 100M+ DAU. I have competing offers from [Snap at $255K TC / Pinterest at $262K TC / Discord at $258K TC]. Reddit's buyback upside and my reliability impact justify equity-heavy DevOps comp." Accept at $198K+ base and $148K+ RSUs.
