**Negotiation DNA**

Reddit Software Engineers build the infrastructure powering the internet's largest community platform — 100M+ DAU, 100K+ active communities, and a rapidly scaling advertising business that drove Reddit's 2024 IPO and 2025 profitability milestone. Your engineering drives the feed algorithms, real-time commenting systems, community tools, and ad delivery infrastructure that convert Reddit's massive engagement into revenue. The $1B share buyback announced February 2026 signals management's confidence in the stock's undervaluation — making RSUs the most compelling negotiation lever. [Source: Reddit SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As a Software Engineer, I want more of my compensation in RSUs rather than cash. Reddit's $1B buyback tells me the company believes the stock is undervalued — and the buyback itself creates price support by reducing float. Every RSU I receive benefits from the buyback's liquidity floor. I'm asking for an additional $25K-$40K in RSU grants because the buyback de-risks equity compensation and signals the stock has significant upside from here." Push for RSU-heavy packages — the buyback makes equity the smartest compensation bet at Reddit.

**Global Levers**

1. **$1B Buyback — RSU Liquidity Floor:** "Reddit's $1B share buyback creates a price floor for my RSUs. I want more equity because the company is signaling the stock is undervalued — and actively supporting the price. Shift $20K-$30K from cash to RSUs."
2. **Post-IPO Profitability Inflection:** "Reddit hit profitability in 2025 and announced a $1B buyback in 2026. This is the inflection point — I'm joining a company that just proved its business model works. My engineering accelerates revenue growth."
3. **100M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "I build systems serving 100M+ daily active users across 100K+ communities. This scale of real-time community infrastructure is matched only by Meta and Twitter/X."
4. **AI & Data Licensing Revenue:** "Reddit's data licensing deals (Google, OpenAI) create a unique revenue stream. My engineering on content systems directly increases the value of Reddit's data assets."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $192K base and $142K RSUs over 4 years for this Software Engineer role. Reddit's $1B share buyback creates a liquidity floor that makes RSUs the smartest compensation vehicle — I want an equity-heavy package. I'm building platform infrastructure for 100M+ DAU at a company that just proved profitability. I have competing offers from [Snap at $228K TC / Pinterest at $238K TC / Discord at $235K TC]. Reddit's buyback upside and data licensing moat make it uniquely attractive — but the RSUs need to reflect that." Accept at $178K+ base and $125K+ RSUs.
