**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As a Solutions Architect, I design the integrations that enable Reddit's advertising and data licensing revenue. I want more RSUs — Reddit's $1B buyback signals the stock is undervalued, and my architecture directly enables the revenue partnerships that fund the buyback. I'm asking for an additional $25K-$40K in RSU grants. My API design, ad platform architecture, and data licensing integrations directly determine how much revenue Reddit can generate from its partnerships." Push for architecture-level RSU packages that reflect partnership revenue enablement.

**Global Levers**

1. **$1B Buyback — Architecture Enables Revenue:** "Reddit's $1B buyback depends on ad and licensing revenue — and my architecture enables every major revenue partnership. RSUs should reflect that my solutions design directly determines Reddit's revenue capacity."
2. **Data Licensing Architecture:** "I architect the data delivery systems for Reddit's AI training data partnerships — Google, OpenAI, and others. My API design determines the scale and value of Reddit's most unique revenue stream."
3. **Advertising Platform Integration:** "I design the ad platform integrations that enable major brands to spend on Reddit. My architecture determines campaign performance, measurement accuracy, and advertiser satisfaction."
4. **Developer Platform & API Strategy:** "Reddit's developer API ecosystem creates the third-party integrations that extend Reddit's reach. My architectural decisions shape the developer experience and ecosystem growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and $178K RSUs over 4 years for this Solutions Architect role. Reddit's $1B buyback creates a liquidity floor — and my architecture enables the ad and data licensing revenue that funds the buyback. I design the integrations powering Reddit's major revenue partnerships. I have competing offers from [Snap at $262K TC / Pinterest at $272K TC / Discord at $265K TC]. Reddit's data licensing moat and buyback upside justify equity-heavy SA comp." Accept at $202K+ base and $158K+ RSUs.
