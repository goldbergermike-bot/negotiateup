**Negotiation DNA**

Reddit Data Engineers build the data infrastructure powering Reddit's advertising targeting, content recommendation, data licensing partnerships, and business analytics. You own the pipelines that transform billions of posts, comments, and votes into the structured datasets that drive ad targeting, feed ranking, and the AI training data that Google, OpenAI, and other partners pay for. Reddit's data is the most valuable community dataset in the world — and your engineering makes it usable. [Source: Reddit DE Comp 2025-2026]

**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As a Data Engineer, I build the data infrastructure that powers Reddit's two primary revenue streams — advertising and data licensing. I want more RSUs — Reddit's $1B buyback signals the stock is undervalued, and my data pipelines directly enable the revenue that funds the buyback. I'm asking for an additional $20K-$35K in RSU grants. My data engineering on ad targeting pipelines, content signals, and licensing data delivery directly determines how much revenue Reddit extracts from its data assets." Push for data-level RSU packages that reflect infrastructure-to-revenue impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$1B Buyback — Data Infrastructure Enables Revenue:** "Reddit's $1B buyback depends on ad and licensing revenue — and my data engineering powers both. My pipelines transform raw community data into the targeting signals and licensed datasets that generate revenue. RSUs should reflect this foundational role."
2. **Data Licensing Pipeline Ownership:** "I build the data delivery pipelines for Reddit's AI training data partnerships. My engineering determines the scale, quality, and speed of data delivery to Google, OpenAI, and others."
3. **Ad Targeting Data Quality:** "The quality of my data pipelines directly determines ad targeting accuracy — which determines ad revenue per user. My data engineering is the foundation of Reddit's advertising business."
4. **Community Data — World's Most Valuable:** "Reddit's community dataset is the most authentic representation of human discourse online. My data engineering makes billions of posts, comments, and votes accessible for analytics, ML, and licensing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $212K base and $162K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Engineer role. Reddit's $1B buyback creates a liquidity floor — and my data engineering powers both ad targeting and data licensing revenue. Reddit's community dataset is the world's most valuable for AI training. I have competing offers from [Snap at $252K TC / Pinterest at $262K TC / Discord at $258K TC]. Reddit's data moat and buyback upside justify equity-heavy DE comp." Accept at $198K+ base and $142K+ RSUs.
