**Negotiation DNA**

Reddit Data Scientists work with one of the most unique datasets in tech — billions of posts, comments, and votes across 100K+ communities, representing authentic human discourse on every topic imaginable. Your analysis drives ad targeting optimization, feed ranking improvements, community health metrics, and the data licensing strategy that generates revenue from partnerships with Google, OpenAI, and other AI companies. Reddit's data is the training data for the AI era — and your data science makes it valuable. [Source: Reddit DS Comp 2025-2026]

**$1B Share Buyback — The Profitability Script**

Reddit announced a $1B share buyback program in February 2026 — the strongest signal of financial confidence a public company can send. The buyback creates a 'liquidity floor' for Reddit stock: the company is literally buying its own shares, reducing supply and supporting the price. "As a Data Scientist, I optimize the ad targeting and feed ranking models that directly drive Reddit's revenue. I want more RSUs — Reddit's $1B buyback signals the stock is undervalued, and my data science directly improves the metrics that drive share price. I'm asking for an additional $25K-$40K in RSU grants. My optimization of ad CTR, engagement metrics, and content quality scores directly translates to revenue growth — and the buyback's liquidity floor makes RSUs the optimal compensation vehicle." Push for data-science-level RSU packages that reflect analytics-to-revenue impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$1B Buyback — Data Drives Revenue:** "Reddit's $1B buyback is funded by ad revenue growth — and my data science on targeting, ranking, and engagement optimization directly drives that growth. RSUs should reflect my analytics-to-revenue pipeline."
2. **Unique Community Dataset:** "Reddit's dataset is the most authentic representation of human discourse online — billions of posts across 100K+ communities. My data science unlocks the value of this unique asset."
3. **Data Licensing Valuation:** "Reddit's data licensing deals with Google and OpenAI are valued based on data quality metrics I define. My data science directly determines the value of Reddit's most unique revenue stream."
4. **Ad Targeting Optimization:** "I optimize ad targeting models that determine Reddit's ad revenue per user. Every percentage improvement in CTR and engagement directly translates to millions in incremental revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and $188K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Scientist role. Reddit's $1B buyback creates a liquidity floor — and my data science on ad targeting, feed ranking, and data licensing quality directly drives the revenue funding the buyback. Reddit's dataset is uniquely valuable for the AI era. I have competing offers from [Snap at $268K TC / Pinterest at $278K TC / Discord at $272K TC]. Reddit's data moat and buyback upside justify equity-heavy DS comp." Accept at $202K+ base and $168K+ RSUs.
