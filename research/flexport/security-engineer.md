"As a Security Engineer, I protect Flexport's logistics platform handling sensitive international trade data — customs documentation, sanctions compliance, and financial transactions across 100+ jurisdictions. This trade security complexity commands premium compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **International Trade Security:** "I protect systems handling customs documentation, export controls, and sanctions screening across 100+ countries. This international trade compliance security is far more complex than standard application security."
2. **$8B Valuation — Security-Critical Platform:** "Flexport's $8B valuation depends on customer trust. Any security breach involving trade documentation or customs data would have severe regulatory and reputational consequences."
3. **Compliance Framework Expertise:** "I maintain security compliance frameworks across multiple international trade jurisdictions — customs, export controls, and sanctions regulations that require specialized security knowledge."
4. **Security Talent Competition:** "Security engineers with trade compliance expertise are scarce. Logistics companies and financial institutions compete for security engineers who understand international regulatory requirements."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base and $210K equity over 4 years with 15% bonus for this Security Engineer role. I protect Flexport's logistics platform handling sensitive international trade data across 100+ jurisdictions — customs documentation, sanctions compliance, and financial transactions. I have competing offers from [project44 at $325K TC / Amazon Logistics at $340K TC / Maersk Digital at $312K TC]. Security engineers with trade compliance expertise are rare."
