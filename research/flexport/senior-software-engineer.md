**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy (Private) | Freight Forwarding + Supply Chain Tech | $8B Valuation | Global Logistics Platform | **LOGISTICS TECH PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options or RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $175K–$235K | $120K–$280K | 10–15% | $248K–$395K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Flexport Senior Software Engineers own critical systems within the global logistics platform — leading technical design for shipment management, customs automation, carrier integration, and supply chain analytics. At the IC3-IC4 level, you drive architectural decisions, mentor junior engineers, and deliver projects that directly impact Flexport's ability to move freight globally. With the $8B valuation and Convoy asset acquisition expanding trucking capabilities, Senior SWEs are building an increasingly comprehensive digital freight platform. Private equity at this stage offers meaningful upside toward potential IPO. [Source: Flexport Sr SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Supply Chain Digitization — The Logistics Tech Premium**

As a Senior Software Engineer at Flexport, you lead the technical design of systems that power global trade. Your architectural decisions affect shipment routing, customs compliance, and carrier management across multiple transportation modes. "As a Senior Software Engineer, I lead technical design for Flexport's logistics platform — my architectural decisions affect how freight moves across oceans and borders. I want IC3-IC4 equity reflecting both my technical leadership and Flexport's $8B valuation."

**Global Levers**

1. **Technical Leadership — Logistics Complexity:** "I lead technical design for systems handling multi-modal freight routing, customs compliance across 100+ countries, and real-time tracking. This logistics domain complexity, combined with senior technical leadership, commands premium compensation."
2. **$8B Valuation — Pre-IPO Equity:** "Flexport's $8B valuation and growth trajectory toward potential IPO mean equity grants carry significant upside. Senior engineers receive larger equity grants that amplify this upside potential."
3. **Convoy Integration Leadership:** "I lead the technical integration of Convoy's technology assets into Flexport's platform — expanding trucking capabilities and building the most comprehensive digital freight platform in the market."
4. **project44/FourKites/Maersk Competition:** "Senior supply chain platform engineers are aggressively recruited across the logistics tech sector. project44, FourKites, and Maersk Digital offer $370K+ TC packages for senior engineers with logistics domain expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $228K base and $265K equity over 4 years with 15% bonus for this Senior Software Engineer role. I lead technical design for Flexport's logistics platform — driving architectural decisions that affect global freight movement. I have competing offers from [project44 at $375K TC / FourKites at $355K TC / Maersk Digital at $345K TC]. Senior engineers with logistics-tech expertise and architectural leadership are rare." Accept at $195K+ base and $210K+ equity.
