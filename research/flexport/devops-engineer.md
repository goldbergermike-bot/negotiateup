**Negotiation DNA**

Flexport DevOps Engineers ensure the reliability, scalability, and security of the global logistics platform — maintaining infrastructure that supports real-time shipment tracking, customs processing, and carrier management across worldwide freight operations. At the IC2-IC3 level, you own CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, monitoring systems, and deployment automation for a platform where downtime directly impacts physical cargo movement. When Flexport's systems go down, shipments stop — making reliability engineering uniquely high-stakes. [Source: Flexport DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Logistics Infrastructure — The Uptime Premium**

As a DevOps Engineer at Flexport, you maintain infrastructure where reliability has physical-world consequences — cargo delays, missed customs windows, and carrier scheduling failures. "As a DevOps Engineer, I ensure the reliability of Flexport's logistics platform — where downtime means physical cargo stops moving. I want IC2-IC3 equity reflecting the critical nature of logistics infrastructure uptime."

**Global Levers**

1. **Physical-World Reliability:** "Platform downtime at Flexport has physical consequences — shipments stop, customs windows close, carriers miss pickups. I ensure the reliability of infrastructure where uptime directly affects global freight movement."
2. **$8B Valuation — Platform Reliability:** "Flexport's $8B valuation depends on platform reliability. Every minute of downtime has measurable revenue impact across thousands of active shipments."
3. **Multi-Region Infrastructure:** "I manage infrastructure supporting logistics operations across multiple regions and time zones — requiring 24/7 reliability and global deployment strategies."
4. **Supply Chain Tech Competition:** "DevOps engineers who understand logistics platform reliability requirements are competed for across the supply chain tech sector."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $208K base and $195K equity over 4 years with 10% bonus for this DevOps Engineer role. I ensure the reliability of Flexport's logistics platform — where downtime means physical cargo stops moving globally. I have competing offers from [project44 at $308K TC / FourKites at $290K TC / Amazon Logistics at $315K TC]. DevOps engineers who understand logistics reliability constraints are scarce." Accept at $175K+ base and $148K+ equity.
