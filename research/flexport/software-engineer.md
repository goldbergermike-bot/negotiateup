### Software Engineer | Flexport Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy (Private) | Freight Forwarding + Supply Chain Tech | $8B Valuation | Global Logistics Platform | **LOGISTICS TECH PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options or RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $150K–$210K | $70K–$200K | 10% | $195K–$320K |
| Remote US | $140K–$195K | $60K–$180K | 10% | $178K–$295K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Flexport Software Engineers build the technology platform powering the world's most modern freight forwarder — digitizing global trade across ocean, air, trucking, and rail logistics. At the IC2-IC3 level, you build and maintain the systems handling shipment booking, tracking, customs documentation, and carrier management for thousands of global importers and exporters. Flexport's $8B valuation reflects its unique position as both a licensed freight forwarder and a technology company, meaning your code directly moves physical goods across borders. Private equity at this stage carries meaningful upside as Flexport pursues growth toward potential public markets. [Source: Flexport SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Supply Chain Digitization — The Logistics Tech Premium**

As a Software Engineer at Flexport, you build software that has direct physical-world impact — every feature you ship affects how cargo moves across oceans and borders. This tangible impact, combined with the complexity of international logistics (customs regulations, multi-modal routing, carrier APIs, trade compliance), creates a unique engineering challenge. "As a Software Engineer at Flexport, I build the platform digitizing global freight forwarding — my code directly impacts how physical goods cross borders. I want IC2-IC3 equity at $8B valuation because this logistics-tech intersection is uniquely valuable."

**Global Levers**

1. **Physical-World Software Impact:** "My code directly affects how cargo moves globally — shipment routing, customs automation, and carrier management. This physical-world impact requires understanding both software engineering and logistics operations, a rare combination."
2. **$8B Valuation — Growth Equity:** "Flexport's $8B valuation and private status mean equity grants carry significant upside potential. Engineers joining now benefit from pre-IPO pricing while building the platform that's digitizing a $4 trillion global freight industry."
3. **Domain Complexity Premium:** "International logistics involves customs regulations across 100+ countries, multi-modal routing optimization, and real-time tracking across dozens of handoff points. This domain complexity commands a premium over standard SWE roles."
4. **project44/FourKites Competition:** "Supply chain tech companies are competing aggressively for engineers. project44, FourKites, and Maersk Digital all offer competitive packages for SWEs who understand logistics platforms."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $200K base and $185K equity over 4 years with 10% bonus for this Software Engineer role. I build the platform digitizing global freight forwarding — my code moves physical goods across borders at scale. I have competing offers from [project44 at $295K TC / FourKites at $280K TC / Maersk Digital at $275K TC]. Engineers who combine software skills with logistics domain understanding are scarce." Accept at $170K+ base and $140K+ equity.
