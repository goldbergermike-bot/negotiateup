**Negotiation DNA**

Flexport Data Scientists apply statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and optimization algorithms to the world's most complex logistics challenges — route optimization, demand forecasting, carrier performance prediction, and supply chain risk assessment. At the IC2-IC3 level, you build models that directly improve how freight moves globally, optimizing shipment routing across ocean, air, and ground transportation modes while reducing costs and transit times for Flexport's customers. Flexport's $8B valuation reflects the competitive advantage created by data-driven logistics decisions. [Source: Flexport DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Flexport DS (IC2-IC3) = project44 DS = FourKites DS = Maersk Digital DS = C.H. Robinson DS = Google L3-L4 DS

**Supply Chain Analytics — The Optimization Premium**

As a Data Scientist at Flexport, you build predictive models and optimization algorithms that directly impact global freight movement. Your models determine optimal shipping routes, predict carrier reliability, forecast demand, and assess supply chain risks. "As a Data Scientist, I build the predictive models and optimization algorithms powering Flexport's logistics decisions — route optimization, demand forecasting, and supply chain risk assessment. I want equity reflecting how my models directly improve freight movement."

**Global Levers**

1. **Logistics Optimization Models:** "I build optimization models for multi-modal freight routing, carrier selection, and demand forecasting. These models directly reduce shipping costs and transit times — measurable revenue impact that justifies premium compensation."
2. **$8B Valuation — Data-Driven Advantage:** "Flexport's competitive moat depends on superior logistics intelligence. My predictive models and optimization algorithms are the core differentiator versus traditional freight forwarders."
3. **Supply Chain Domain Expertise:** "Data scientists who understand freight forwarding — tariff optimization, carrier reliability modeling, customs clearance prediction — are exceptionally rare. This domain expertise is not available from standard DS hiring pools."
4. **project44/FourKites Competition:** "Supply chain analytics is a competitive talent market. project44, FourKites, and Amazon Logistics offer competitive packages for data scientists with logistics modeling expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $210K base and $200K equity over 4 years with 10% bonus for this Data Scientist role. I build the predictive models and optimization algorithms powering Flexport's logistics intelligence — route optimization, demand forecasting, and supply chain risk assessment. I have competing offers from [project44 at $315K TC / Amazon Logistics at $325K TC / FourKites at $295K TC]. Data scientists with logistics optimization expertise are scarce." Accept at $178K+ base and $155K+ equity.
