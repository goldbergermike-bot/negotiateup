**Supply Chain Data — The Logistics Intelligence Premium**

As a Data Engineer at Flexport, you build the data foundation for supply chain intelligence — processing and serving data from thousands of shipments across multiple transportation modes, customs jurisdictions, and carrier networks. "As a Data Engineer, I build the data infrastructure powering Flexport's supply chain intelligence — processing shipment tracking, customs data, and carrier metrics across global freight. I want IC2-IC3 equity reflecting the foundational importance of logistics data."

**Global Levers**

1. **Supply Chain Data Infrastructure:** "I build data pipelines processing shipment tracking, customs documentation, and carrier performance data across global freight networks. This logistics data complexity — multi-modal, multi-jurisdictional, real-time — exceeds standard data engineering challenges."
2. **$8B Valuation — Data-Driven Logistics:** "Flexport's competitive advantage depends on data-driven logistics decisions. My data infrastructure enables route optimization, carrier selection, and supply chain forecasting — directly impacting Flexport's revenue and market position."
3. **Logistics Data Domain Expertise:** "Data engineers who understand freight forwarding data — customs tariff codes, bill of lading schemas, carrier API data models — are exceptionally rare. This domain expertise commands a premium over generic data engineering roles."
4. **project44/FourKites DE Competition:** "Supply chain visibility companies are competing aggressively for data engineers. project44 and FourKites offer competitive packages for DEs who can build real-time logistics data pipelines."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $208K base and $195K equity over 4 years with 10% bonus for this Data Engineer role. I build the data infrastructure powering Flexport's supply chain intelligence — processing shipment tracking and customs data across global freight networks. I have competing offers from [project44 at $310K TC / FourKites at $295K TC / Maersk Digital at $288K TC]. Data engineers with logistics domain expertise are scarce." Accept at $175K+ base and $150K+ equity.
