### ML/AI Engineer | Flexport Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy (Private) | Freight Forwarding + Supply Chain Tech | $8B Valuation | Global Logistics Platform | **LOGISTICS AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options or RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$228K | $90K–$245K | 10–15% | $225K–$368K |
| Remote US | $152K–$212K | $78K–$220K | 10–15% | $205K–$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Flexport ML/AI Engineers build machine learning models and AI systems that optimize global freight operations — demand forecasting, route optimization, customs classification automation, carrier matching, and supply chain risk prediction. At the IC2-IC4 level, you develop and deploy ML models that directly improve how cargo moves across the global logistics network. Flexport's $8B valuation reflects the competitive advantage created by AI-driven logistics, and ML/AI engineers are central to that differentiation. [Source: Flexport ML/AI Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Flexport ML/AI (IC2-IC4) = project44 ML Engineer = FourKites ML Engineer = Maersk Digital ML Engineer = Google L3-L5 ML Logistics

**Logistics AI — The Optimization Premium**

As an ML/AI Engineer at Flexport, you build intelligent systems that optimize physical-world logistics operations. Your models determine the fastest, cheapest, and most reliable routes for global freight. "As an ML/AI Engineer, I build the machine learning systems optimizing Flexport's global freight operations — route optimization, demand forecasting, and carrier matching. I want equity reflecting how my models create Flexport's core competitive advantage."

**Global Levers**

1. **Physical-World ML Impact:** "My ML models optimize real-world freight movement — routing cargo across oceans and borders, predicting carrier reliability, and automating customs classification. This physical-world optimization is uniquely challenging and valuable."
2. **$8B Valuation — AI Differentiation:** "Flexport's competitive moat depends on AI-driven logistics intelligence. My models are the core differentiator versus traditional freight forwarders who rely on manual operations."
3. **Supply Chain ML Expertise:** "ML engineers who understand logistics — freight routing constraints, customs compliance rules, carrier reliability signals — are extremely rare. This domain expertise commands a significant premium."
4. **AI Competition — Logistics Sector:** "Amazon Logistics, project44, and Maersk Digital all invest heavily in logistics ML. Engineers who can build optimization models for global freight are competed for aggressively."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $220K base and $230K equity over 4 years with 15% bonus for this ML/AI Engineer role. I build the machine learning systems optimizing Flexport's global freight operations — route optimization, demand forecasting, and carrier matching. I have competing offers from [Amazon Logistics at $352K TC / project44 at $335K TC / Maersk Digital at $320K TC]. ML engineers with logistics domain expertise are exceptionally scarce." Accept at $188K+ base and $178K+ equity.
