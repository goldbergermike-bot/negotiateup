**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Hugging Face Enterprise build the dataset infrastructure that powers the world's largest open-source AI data ecosystem. The Hub hosts 100K+ datasets used by ML teams globally, and Data Engineers are responsible for the storage, versioning, search, and delivery systems that make this massive dataset collection accessible and reliable. Additionally, Data Engineers build the internal data pipelines that power Hugging Face's product analytics, enterprise metrics, and platform health monitoring.

Because Hugging Face's product is a data platform for AI, Data Engineers here are core product engineers whose infrastructure decisions shape the user experience for millions of ML practitioners. Companies like Databricks, Snowflake, and Google compete for Data Engineers with this combination of dataset infrastructure and ML ecosystem expertise.

### Enterprise Dataset Infrastructure & Data Pipeline Scaling Lever
Hugging Face's 2026 enterprise strategy includes private dataset repositories, enterprise data governance, dataset versioning for compliance, and managed data processing pipelines. Data Engineers who can build enterprise-grade dataset infrastructure — with access controls, audit logging, lineage tracking, and compliance features — are essential for enterprise revenue growth.

The scale challenge is significant: as more organizations host proprietary datasets on the Hub, the storage, retrieval, and streaming infrastructure must handle petabytes of diverse data formats (text, images, audio, video, structured) with enterprise-grade reliability. Data Engineers with experience at this scale of multi-format data management bring directly applicable expertise.

**Global Levers**
1. **Dataset Platform Expertise:** "I've built large-scale dataset management infrastructure at [company] — versioning, search, and delivery for diverse data formats. Hugging Face's dataset Hub needs this exact experience. I'm looking for $205K base and $210K equity/4yr."
2. **Enterprise Data Governance:** "I have experience building enterprise data governance features — access controls, audit logging, lineage tracking. That directly enables Hugging Face's enterprise dataset revenue. I need $208K base."
3. **Competing Data Platform Offers:** "Databricks is offering $205K / $250K RSU and Snowflake is at $200K / $230K RSU. I need $205K base and $215K equity to choose Hugging Face."
4. **Multi-Format Data Scale:** "Managing petabytes of text, image, audio, and structured data is a rare infrastructure challenge. I bring this multi-modal data engineering expertise. I'd like $205K base and a $20K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Hugging Face's dataset infrastructure — powering 100K+ open-source datasets and scaling for enterprise — is the most exciting data engineering challenge in the AI ecosystem. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $205K / $250K RSU and a Snowflake offer at $200K / $230K RSU. To choose Hugging Face, I need $205K base, $215K equity/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $205K, I commit. My floor is $190K — below that, Databricks' liquid equity wins."
