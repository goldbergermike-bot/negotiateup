### Data Scientist | Hugging Face Enterprise Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity | Open-Source AI Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Model Evaluation Intelligence & Hub Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $170K–$225K | $130K–$245K | 5–10% | $220K–$308K |
| New York | $165K–$220K | $130K–$245K | 5–10% | $215K–$301K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Hugging Face Enterprise build the intelligence layer that makes the Hub smart — model quality scoring algorithms, automated benchmark evaluation systems, model recommendation engines, dataset quality metrics, and the analytics that help enterprise customers discover and evaluate models for their specific use cases. You sit at the intersection of ML research and product engineering, building ML-powered features that serve ML practitioners — a uniquely recursive and high-leverage position.

Because Hugging Face's users are ML practitioners, the Data Scientist role demands exceptional domain expertise. You must understand transformer architectures, fine-tuning methodologies, evaluation benchmarks, and model deployment patterns deeply enough to build features that sophisticated ML engineers find genuinely useful. This deep ML domain knowledge, combined with product data science skills, is a rare combination that few candidates possess.

### Model Evaluation Intelligence & Hub Analytics Lever
Hugging Face's 2026 strategy includes building intelligent model evaluation and recommendation systems — helping enterprise customers automatically evaluate models against their specific tasks, compare model quality across architectures, and identify the best model for their use case without manual benchmarking. Data Scientists who can build these evaluation intelligence systems will transform the Hub from a model repository into an intelligent model marketplace.

The Open LLM Leaderboard and model evaluation infrastructure are among Hugging Face's most visible and impactful features. Data Scientists who can extend these evaluation frameworks to serve enterprise needs — private benchmarks, custom evaluation criteria, automated model selection — are building the infrastructure that differentiates Hugging Face's enterprise offering from self-hosted model registries.

**Global Levers**
1. **Meta-ML Evaluation Expertise:** "I build ML systems that evaluate ML models — benchmark design, quality scoring, automated evaluation pipelines. That recursive expertise is rare and directly applicable to Hugging Face's evaluation infrastructure. I need $220K base and $235K equity/4yr."
2. **Open-Source ML Evaluation Influence:** "I've contributed to ML evaluation benchmarks used by the community. My work at Hugging Face will shape how the industry evaluates models. That influence commands $225K base."
3. **Competing AI Company DS Offers:** "Google is offering L5 DS at $222K / $280K RSU and Databricks is at $218K / $260K RSU. I need $220K base and $240K equity to choose Hugging Face."
4. **Enterprise Model Discovery Revenue:** "My evaluation intelligence features will directly drive enterprise Hub subscriptions — enterprises will pay for intelligent model recommendations. That revenue impact justifies $220K base and a $25K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Building the intelligence layer for the world's largest AI model ecosystem — model evaluation, quality scoring, intelligent recommendations — is the most impactful data science role in the ML community. I'm holding a Google L5 DS offer at $222K / $280K RSU and a Databricks offer at $218K / $260K RSU. To choose Hugging Face, I need $220K base, $238K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $220K, I commit to building Hugging Face's evaluation intelligence. My floor is $205K — below that, Google's liquid equity wins."
