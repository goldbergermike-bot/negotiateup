### Technical Program Manager | Hugging Face Enterprise Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity | Open-Source AI Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Enterprise Product Launch & Open-Source Release Orchestration

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $170K–$220K | $120K–$225K | 10–15% | $230K–$313K |
| New York | $165K–$215K | $120K–$225K | 10–15% | $225K–$305K |
| Paris | EUR145K–EUR187K | EUR102K–EUR191K | 10–15% | EUR196K–EUR266K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Hugging Face Enterprise orchestrate the most complex cross-functional initiatives at the company — enterprise product launches, open-source library releases, platform migrations, compliance certification programs, and the coordination between engineering, product, ML research, community, and go-to-market teams. At Hugging Face, TPMs navigate a unique complexity: every major initiative has both an open-source community dimension and an enterprise product dimension, requiring coordination across fundamentally different stakeholder groups.

The TPM role at Hugging Face is deeply technical — you must understand ML model architectures, inference serving, and open-source development workflows well enough to identify risks and resolve dependencies across a globally distributed engineering organization. Companies like GitHub, Google, and Databricks compete for TPMs with this open-source + enterprise technical depth.

### Enterprise Product Launch & Open-Source Release Orchestration Lever
Hugging Face's 2026 roadmap includes simultaneous enterprise product launches (Inference Endpoints upgrades, enterprise Hub features, compliance certifications) and high-profile open-source releases (Transformers library updates, new model architectures, community tools). TPMs must orchestrate these parallel workstreams — managing dependencies between enterprise features and open-source infrastructure, coordinating with ML researchers on model release timelines, and ensuring enterprise SLAs aren't disrupted by community-facing launches.

The global coordination dimension adds complexity: Hugging Face's engineering spans San Francisco, New York, and Paris, and TPMs must coordinate across time zones while managing both open-source community expectations and enterprise customer commitments. TPMs with experience at globally distributed open-source companies bring directly applicable skills.

**Global Levers**
1. **Open-Source + Enterprise TPM Expertise:** "I've orchestrated programs at companies that balance open-source releases with enterprise product delivery — managing the unique coordination challenges this dual model creates. That expertise commands $215K base and $215K equity/4yr."
2. **Global Program Coordination:** "I've managed cross-functional programs across US and European engineering teams. Hugging Face's global footprint needs this experience. I need $218K base."
3. **Competing TPM Offers:** "GitHub is offering TPM at $215K / $260K RSU and Google is at L5 TPM with $210K / $250K RSU. I need $215K base and $220K equity to choose Hugging Face."
4. **Compliance Program Acceleration:** "I've led SOC 2 and enterprise compliance programs at [company]. Accelerating Hugging Face's compliance by 6+ months directly enables enterprise revenue. I'd like a $25K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Orchestrating Hugging Face's parallel enterprise and open-source initiatives — across a globally distributed team — is the most complex TPM role in AI. I'm holding a GitHub TPM offer at $215K / $260K RSU and a Google L5 TPM offer at $210K / $250K RSU. To choose Hugging Face, I need $215K base, $220K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $215K, I commit to building the program management infrastructure for Hugging Face's enterprise growth. My floor is $200K — below that, GitHub's liquid equity wins."
