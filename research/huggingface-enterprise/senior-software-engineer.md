### Senior Software Engineer | Hugging Face Enterprise Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Growth-Stage Equity | Open-Source AI Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Enterprise-Grade Model Serving & Hub Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $205K–$260K | $200K–$350K | 5–10% | $273K–$410K |
| New York | $200K–$255K | $200K–$350K | 5–10% | $268K–$403K |
| Paris | EUR175K–EUR222K | EUR170K–EUR298K | 5–10% | EUR233K–EUR350K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Hugging Face Enterprise own major infrastructure domains: the Hub's model hosting and versioning system, the Inference Endpoints serving platform, the Spaces compute layer, enterprise authentication and access controls, or the Transformers library integration layer. At this level, Hugging Face expects engineers who can independently architect solutions for millions of users, make build-vs-buy decisions for critical infrastructure, and mentor the growing engineering team.

Hugging Face's position as the GitHub of AI means Senior SWEs shape how the entire industry discovers, shares, and deploys models. This is an outsized-impact role that attracts talent from Google, Meta AI, and the top AI labs. Competing offers from these companies — which often include liquid equity and established career ladders — are your primary negotiation leverage. Emphasize the trade-off you're making by choosing growth-stage equity over public-company liquidity.

### Enterprise-Grade Model Serving & Hub Infrastructure Lever
Hugging Face's 2026 enterprise push demands that the Hub and Inference Endpoints meet Fortune 500 reliability, security, and performance requirements. Senior Engineers will architect enterprise model registries with fine-grained access controls, build auto-scaling inference serving that handles variable enterprise workloads cost-efficiently, and create the monitoring and observability infrastructure that enterprise customers expect. This work directly determines Hugging Face's enterprise revenue.

The model serving challenge is technically demanding: serving diverse model architectures (from 7B parameter models to 70B+ models) efficiently on heterogeneous GPU hardware, with dynamic batching, model caching, and automatic optimization. Senior Engineers with model serving and GPU infrastructure experience are in extraordinary demand as every company deploys open-source models in production.

**Global Levers**
1. **Model Serving Architecture Premium:** "I've built production model serving infrastructure at [company] — auto-scaling, multi-model, multi-GPU with enterprise SLAs. Hugging Face needs this exact expertise for Inference Endpoints. I'm looking for $255K base and $340K equity/4yr."
2. **Open-Source Ecosystem Leadership:** "I'm a recognized contributor to the open-source ML ecosystem with deep community relationships. My work at Hugging Face will carry outsized influence and adoption. That impact commands $258K base."
3. **Competing Senior AI Offers:** "Google is offering L5 at $250K / $380K RSU and Anthropic is at $248K / $330K equity. Hugging Face's open-source mission is compelling, but I need $255K base and $345K equity to offset the liquidity gap."
4. **Enterprise Revenue Enablement:** "My infrastructure work directly enables enterprise model serving revenue. Every enterprise Inference Endpoints customer I help onboard adds six-figure ARR. I'd like $260K base and a $35K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Hugging Face is the platform that defines how the world uses open-source AI — and I want to build the enterprise infrastructure that monetizes that position. I'm holding a Google L5 offer at $250K / $380K RSU and an Anthropic offer at $248K / $330K equity. To choose Hugging Face, I need $255K base, $340K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $35K signing bonus. At $255K base, I commit to building enterprise-grade model serving. My floor is $235K — below that, Google's liquid equity is the rational choice."
