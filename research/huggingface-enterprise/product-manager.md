### Product Manager | Hugging Face Enterprise Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Growth-Stage Equity | Open-Source AI Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Enterprise Model Marketplace & Monetization Strategy

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $180K–$235K | $155K–$280K | 10–15% | $253K–$363K |
| New York | $175K–$230K | $155K–$280K | 10–15% | $248K–$355K |
| Paris | EUR153K–EUR200K | EUR132K–EUR238K | 10–15% | EUR215K–EUR309K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Hugging Face Enterprise drive the strategy for monetizing the world's largest open-source AI platform — defining which features become enterprise-only, how to price model hosting and inference, and how to build a product that Fortune 500 companies will pay for while keeping the open-source community thriving. This is one of the most strategically complex PM roles in tech: every product decision must balance community goodwill with enterprise revenue, open-source principles with commercial viability.

PMs at Hugging Face must be deeply technical — understanding transformer architectures, model deployment workflows, fine-tuning processes, and the ML lifecycle well enough to make informed product decisions for the world's most sophisticated AI practitioners. PMs with ML practitioner backgrounds or deep open-source ecosystem experience are particularly valuable and command a premium.

### Enterprise Model Marketplace & Monetization Strategy Lever
Hugging Face's 2026 product strategy centers on building the enterprise AI marketplace — premium model hosting, managed inference, enterprise-grade model evaluation, and curated model collections for specific industries. PMs who can define the marketplace strategy, pricing models, and enterprise feature roadmap are directly responsible for Hugging Face's revenue trajectory.

The open-source monetization challenge is particularly nuanced: PMs must define what's free vs. paid in a way that grows the community (the moat) while capturing value from enterprises willing to pay for reliability, security, and support. PMs who have navigated open-source monetization at companies like GitHub, Elastic, or MongoDB bring directly applicable strategic experience.

**Global Levers**
1. **Open-Source Monetization PM Expertise:** "I've driven open-source monetization strategy at [company] — defining free vs. paid features, enterprise pricing, and community-commercial balance. That experience is directly applicable and commands $230K base and $270K equity/4yr."
2. **ML Domain PM Premium:** "I've been an ML practitioner and a PM. I understand the model lifecycle from the practitioner side, which is essential for building products that ML teams actually pay for. I need $232K base."
3. **Competing PM Offers:** "GitHub is offering PM at $228K / $290K RSU and Databricks is at $230K / $310K RSU. I need $230K base and $275K equity to choose Hugging Face."
4. **Marketplace Revenue Strategy Impact:** "My product decisions will define how Hugging Face monetizes the world's largest AI model ecosystem. That strategic leverage justifies $235K base and a $30K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Defining the product strategy for the world's largest AI model ecosystem — enterprise monetization, model marketplace, inference pricing — is the most strategically consequential PM role in the AI industry. I'm holding a GitHub PM offer at $228K / $290K RSU and a Databricks offer at $230K / $310K RSU. To choose Hugging Face, I need $230K base, $272K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $230K, I commit to building Hugging Face's enterprise revenue engine. My floor is $215K — below that, Databricks' liquid equity and established enterprise PM role wins."
