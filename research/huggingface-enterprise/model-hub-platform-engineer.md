### Model Hub Platform Engineer | Hugging Face Enterprise Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Growth-Stage Equity + AI Premium | Open-Source AI Platform Leader | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | 2026 Focus: Next-Gen Model Hub Architecture & Enterprise Model Marketplace

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $215K–$275K | $230K–$400K | 10–15% | $305K–$460K |
| New York | $210K–$270K | $230K–$400K | 10–15% | $300K–$453K |
| Paris | EUR183K–EUR234K | EUR196K–EUR340K | 10–15% | EUR260K–EUR392K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The Model Hub Platform Engineer is Hugging Face's signature role — the position that builds and evolves the core platform that defines Hugging Face's identity and value. The Hub is the center of the open-source AI ecosystem: 500K+ models, 100K+ datasets, millions of monthly active users, and the infrastructure that the world's AI teams depend on to discover, share, version, and deploy models. You don't just build features on a platform — you build the platform that powers the global AI ecosystem.

Model Hub Platform Engineers architect and build the model storage and versioning system (Git LFS at massive scale), the model discovery and search infrastructure, the model card rendering and documentation system, the API layer that serves billions of model downloads, the enterprise model registry with access controls and audit logging, and the integration layer that connects the Hub with Transformers, Inference Endpoints, and Spaces. This requires an extraordinarily rare skill combination: distributed systems expertise (handling billions of requests), ML domain knowledge (understanding model formats, architectures, and workflows), developer tools sensibility (building APIs and interfaces that millions of developers love), and the architectural judgment to evolve a beloved platform without breaking the community experience.

### Next-Gen Model Hub Architecture & Enterprise Model Marketplace Lever
Hugging Face's 2026 Hub evolution centers on transforming the model repository into an intelligent enterprise model marketplace — where enterprises can discover models by task and performance, evaluate models against their data before deploying, manage model versions with enterprise governance, and deploy directly to managed inference with a single click. The Model Hub Platform Engineer will architect the systems that make this marketplace vision possible: intelligent search and recommendation, enterprise-grade model versioning with compliance tracking, seamless inference deployment pipelines, and the data model that unifies models, datasets, evaluations, and deployments into a coherent platform.

This architecture work determines Hugging Face's commercial future. The Hub's open-source model repository is the company's moat — it's why millions of developers use Hugging Face and why enterprises trust the platform. But the enterprise marketplace features must be built without compromising the open-source experience that created the moat in the first place. Model Hub Platform Engineers who can navigate this architectural tension — building enterprise-grade features on a beloved open-source foundation — are solving Hugging Face's most important and most difficult technical challenge.

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Scarcity Premium:** "Engineers who can architect the platform powering the world's AI model ecosystem — distributed systems at billion-request scale, ML domain expertise, and open-source community sensibility — are vanishingly rare. This is Hugging Face's defining technical role. I'm looking for $270K base and $390K equity/4yr."
2. **Enterprise Model Marketplace Architecture Impact:** "I'll be architecting the platform that transforms the Hub from a model repository into an enterprise AI marketplace. My architecture decisions will determine Hugging Face's commercial trajectory. That foundational impact commands $275K base and $400K equity/4yr."
3. **Competing Platform Engineer Offers:** "Google is offering L6 Infrastructure at $278K / $510K RSU and GitHub Staff Platform at $272K / $460K RSU — both liquid. I need $275K base, $395K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $55K signing bonus."
4. **Platform = Ecosystem Moat:** "The Hub is Hugging Face's moat — it's why the company exists and why enterprises pay. My platform architecture work directly protects and extends that moat. I'd like retention-grade equity: $400K/4yr with guaranteed $110K/year refreshes starting year two."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Building the platform that powers the world's AI model ecosystem — the Hub that 500K+ models and millions of developers depend on — is the most consequential platform engineering role in the AI industry. I'm holding a Google L6 Infrastructure offer at $278K / $510K RSU and a GitHub Staff Platform offer at $272K / $460K RSU — both liquid, both compelling. To choose Hugging Face, I need $275K base, $395K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, a $55K signing bonus, and guaranteed $110K/year equity refreshes starting year two. The Hub is Hugging Face's identity — and I'm the engineer who can evolve it into the enterprise AI marketplace the industry needs. At $275K base, I sign immediately and dedicate my career to making the Hub the default platform for every AI team on earth. My floor is $255K — below that, Google's liquid equity and infrastructure resources make the trade-off irrational, even for a role this consequential."
