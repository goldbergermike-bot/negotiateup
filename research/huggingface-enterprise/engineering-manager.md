### Engineering Manager | Hugging Face Enterprise Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Significant Growth-Stage Equity | Open-Source AI Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Scaling Enterprise Engineering Organization

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $220K–$275K | $220K–$390K | 10–15% | $303K–$453K |
| New York | $215K–$270K | $220K–$390K | 10–15% | $298K–$443K |
| Paris | EUR187K–EUR234K | EUR187K–EUR332K | 10–15% | EUR258K–EUR386K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Hugging Face Enterprise lead teams building the infrastructure, products, and features that power the world's largest open-source AI platform. EMs here manage 6-12 engineers across Hub infrastructure, Inference Endpoints, Spaces, Transformers library, or enterprise features. The EM role at Hugging Face is deeply technical — you must understand ML systems, model serving architecture, and open-source development dynamics well enough to make informed architectural trade-offs and participate in design reviews.

At Hugging Face, EMs face a unique leadership challenge: balancing open-source community engagement (where engineers contribute to public repositories and engage with community feedback) with enterprise product delivery (where the priority is shipping features that drive revenue). EMs who can navigate this tension — keeping engineers engaged with the community while shipping enterprise features on schedule — bring a rare organizational capability.

### Scaling Enterprise Engineering Organization Lever
Hugging Face's 2026 growth plan requires scaling the engineering organization to support both open-source platform development and enterprise product delivery — two very different engineering cultures that must coexist. EMs must hire engineers who are passionate about open-source AI and also effective at shipping enterprise features, create team structures that balance community contributions with product roadmap execution, and build processes that maintain Hugging Face's collaborative culture at 2-3x the current team size.

The global hiring dimension adds further complexity: Hugging Face has a strong presence in Paris and across Europe, and EMs must build globally distributed teams that collaborate effectively across time zones. EMs with experience managing distributed engineering teams at open-source or developer tools companies bring directly applicable experience.

**Global Levers**
1. **Open-Source + Enterprise EM Expertise:** "I've led engineering teams that balance open-source community engagement with enterprise product delivery at [company]. That dual-mode leadership capability is rare. I'm looking for $270K base and $375K equity/4yr."
2. **Global Team Building:** "I've built distributed engineering teams across US and Europe — exactly the hiring footprint Hugging Face operates. That global EM experience commands $273K base."
3. **Competing EM Offers:** "Google is offering L6 EM at $268K / $430K RSU and Databricks EM at $260K / $400K RSU — both liquid. I need $270K base and $380K equity to choose Hugging Face."
4. **ML Engineering Talent Network:** "I can bring a network of exceptional ML infrastructure engineers to Hugging Face. That hiring multiplier justifies $275K base and a $40K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Hugging Face's engineering leadership challenge — scaling an org that balances open-source community magic with enterprise product rigor — is uniquely compelling. I'm holding a Google L6 EM offer at $268K / $430K RSU and a Databricks EM offer at $260K / $400K RSU. To choose Hugging Face, I need $270K base, $380K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $40K signing bonus. At $270K, I commit to building the engineering organization for Hugging Face's enterprise era. My floor is $250K — below that, Google's liquid equity is the rational choice."
