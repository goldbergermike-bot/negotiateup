**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Hugging Face Enterprise face one of the most unique and consequential security challenges in tech: securing an open platform that hosts 500K+ models, 100K+ datasets, and millions of active users — while enterprise customers trust it with their proprietary models, datasets, and inference workloads. The threat surface is enormous: malicious model uploads (models that execute code on download), poisoned datasets, compromised Spaces applications, supply chain attacks through the Transformers library, and the standard enterprise security concerns of access control, data isolation, and compliance.

Hugging Face's position as the "npm/GitHub of AI" means a security breach could have cascading effects across the entire AI industry — if a popular model is compromised, every organization using it is affected. Security Engineers who understand both traditional application security and the emerging field of ML model security are in extreme demand and short supply.

### Model Supply Chain Security & Enterprise Compliance Lever
Hugging Face's 2026 security mandate includes building the model supply chain security infrastructure that the entire AI industry needs: model provenance verification, malware scanning for uploaded models, model signing and integrity verification, and secure model distribution pipelines. This is a nascent field — model supply chain security is where software supply chain security was 10 years ago — and Security Engineers who can define and build these systems are pioneering an entirely new security discipline.

The enterprise compliance dimension is equally critical: Fortune 500 customers require SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, and increasingly AI-specific compliance certifications. Security Engineers who can build compliance programs while simultaneously inventing model security best practices are building Hugging Face's enterprise moat.

**Global Levers**
1. **Model Supply Chain Security Pioneer:** "Model supply chain security is a nascent field and I'm one of few security engineers with this expertise. I've built artifact integrity and provenance systems at [company]. That pioneering expertise commands $230K base and $250K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Security + Traditional Security Dual Expertise:** "Combining ML model security knowledge with enterprise application security experience is exceptionally rare. I bring both. I need $232K base."
3. **Competing Security Offers:** "GitHub is offering Security Engineer at $225K / $270K RSU and CrowdStrike is at $220K / $260K RSU. I need $228K base and $250K equity to choose Hugging Face."
4. **Enterprise Compliance Revenue Enablement:** "SOC 2, HIPAA, and AI-specific compliance certifications directly enable Hugging Face's enterprise deals. I've accelerated compliance programs at [company]. I'd like a $30K signing bonus for the revenue impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Securing the world's largest AI model ecosystem — model supply chain security, enterprise compliance, and protecting millions of developers — is the most consequential security engineering role in AI. I'm holding a GitHub offer at $225K / $270K RSU and a CrowdStrike offer at $220K / $260K RSU. To choose Hugging Face, I need $228K base, $248K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $228K, I commit to building AI security for the industry. My floor is $212K — below that, GitHub's liquid equity and established security program wins."
