**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Hugging Face Enterprise shape the experience for the world's largest AI model and dataset ecosystem — designing how ML practitioners discover models, explore datasets, deploy inference endpoints, and collaborate through Spaces. The design challenge is uniquely complex: the Hub must feel approachable to beginners (first-time model users) while being powerful enough for expert ML researchers pushing state-of-the-art models. This dual-audience design tension requires exceptional skill.

Hugging Face's open-source community is deeply design-sensitive — the platform's usability is a core competitive advantage over self-hosted alternatives. Designers who can create intuitive interfaces for technically complex ML workflows (model cards, dataset viewers, evaluation dashboards, inference playgrounds) bring a rare combination of technical understanding and design craft. Companies like Figma, GitHub, and Vercel compete for designers with this developer-tool sensibility.

### Enterprise AI Platform Experience Design Lever
Hugging Face's 2026 enterprise product expansion creates new design challenges: enterprise model registries with complex permission hierarchies, team collaboration spaces, audit and compliance dashboards, and enterprise inference monitoring interfaces. Designers must create enterprise-grade experiences that feel like the delightful open-source Hub — not bloated enterprise software. This "enterprise experience that doesn't feel enterprise" design philosophy is rare and valuable.

Additionally, the AI interaction design challenge is growing: designing model playgrounds, inference testing interfaces, and evaluation comparison views requires understanding how AI models behave and how to help users build intuition about model capabilities and limitations. Designers with AI interface experience are pioneering new interaction patterns.

**Global Levers**
1. **Developer Tool Design Specialization:** "Designing for ML practitioners — model discovery, dataset exploration, inference testing — requires deep domain understanding. I've designed developer tools at [company]. That specialization commands $200K base and $190K equity/4yr."
2. **Open-Source Community Design Impact:** "Hugging Face's design decisions affect millions of developers. The community influence of this role is enormous. I need $202K base to reflect that impact."
3. **Competing Design-Forward Offers:** "GitHub is offering $195K / $230K RSU and Figma is at $192K / $220K RSU. I need $200K base and $195K equity to choose Hugging Face."
4. **Enterprise + Community Design Tension:** "Designing enterprise features that feel like the beloved open-source Hub — not bloated enterprise software — is a rare design skill. I'd like $200K base and a $20K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Designing the experience for the world's largest AI model ecosystem — making complex ML workflows intuitive for millions of developers — is the most impactful design role in AI tooling. I'm holding a GitHub offer at $195K / $230K RSU and a Figma offer at $192K / $220K RSU. To choose Hugging Face, I need $200K base, $195K equity/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $200K, I commit. My floor is $185K — below that, GitHub's liquid equity wins."
