**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Runway work at the frontier of generative AI — building and optimizing the models that power video generation, image synthesis, and creative AI tools used by millions. You'll work on diffusion model training, inference optimization, multimodal architectures, and the ML infrastructure that enables Runway to ship new model capabilities every quarter. The +15-30% ML Premium reflects the extreme demand for engineers who can build and optimize generative models at production scale — particularly those with video and multimodal experience.

**Level Mapping:** Runway ML/AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta ML Engineer IC4-IC5 = OpenAI Research Engineer = Stability AI ML Engineer

**The Startup Equity Play — Pre-IPO at $4B+ Valuation**
ML engineers are the core value creators at Runway — model quality directly drives product differentiation and revenue. Push for equity that reflects this: "The models I build are Runway's product. Model quality improvements translate directly to user growth and enterprise revenue. I want equity that reflects my role at the center of value creation — $400K/4yr minimum."

**Global Levers**
1. **ML Premium (+15-30%):** "Generative AI ML engineers with production experience are among the most sought-after professionals in tech. I have direct experience with [diffusion models / video generation / multimodal architectures], and that expertise commands a 15-30% premium. I'm looking for $265K base."
2. **Model Quality = Revenue:** "Runway's revenue is directly proportional to model quality. Every improvement I make to Gen-3's output quality, speed, or capabilities drives user acquisition and retention. That revenue leverage justifies $270K base and $400K equity/4yr."
3. **Competing AI Lab Offers:** "I have offers from OpenAI at $260K base / $500K equity and Anthropic at $250K base / $400K equity. Runway's creative AI focus is where I want to apply my skills, but the comp needs to be competitive: $270K base and $410K equity/4yr."
4. **Training Compute Cost Leverage:** "I optimize training runs that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per run. A 15% efficiency improvement saves more than my annual salary. That cost leverage should be reflected in compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm an ML engineer specializing in generative models — diffusion architectures, video generation, and inference optimization. I'm holding an OpenAI offer at $260K / $500K equity and a Stability AI offer at $240K / $350K equity. Runway is the leader in creative AI, and Gen-3 is the best video generation system available. To join: $270K base, $400K equity/4yr, and a $55K signing bonus. The ML Premium applies to my skill set. At $270K, I sign this week. Floor is $245K base."
