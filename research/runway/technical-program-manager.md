**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Runway coordinate the most complex cross-functional programs in creative AI — Gen-3 model launches, enterprise platform releases, infrastructure migrations, and the multi-team efforts that ship new AI capabilities to millions of creators. At Runway's pace of innovation, TPMs are essential: model development, product engineering, design, safety, and infrastructure teams must all converge for successful launches, and TPMs orchestrate that convergence. The role requires deep technical understanding of generative AI systems — you need to understand model training timelines, inference infrastructure constraints, and content safety requirements to effectively manage programs.
