### Data Engineer | Runway Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive AI Startup Comp + Pre-IPO Equity | $4B+ Valuation | NYC HQ | Creative AI Data Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $155K-$210K | $90K-$260K | — | $178K-$275K |
| San Francisco | $155K-$210K | $90K-$260K | — | $178K-$275K |
| Remote US | $140K-$189K | $81K-$234K | — | $160K-$248K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Runway build the data infrastructure that fuels generative AI model training — massive video and image datasets, data pipelines for model training and evaluation, data quality systems, and the analytics infrastructure that measures model performance and product usage. In a company where model quality is the product, data quality is the foundation. You'll work with petabytes of video and image data, building pipelines that ensure training data is clean, diverse, representative, and legally compliant. This role is critical to Runway's model development velocity.

**Level Mapping:** Runway Data Engineer = Google L3-L4 Data Engineer = Meta Data Engineer IC3-IC4 = Amazon Data Engineer II

**The Startup Equity Play — Pre-IPO at $4B+ Valuation**
Data engineers at AI companies have more leverage than at traditional tech companies — your data pipelines directly impact model quality and training efficiency. Push for equity that reflects the AI-specific impact: "Data quality is the foundation of model quality at Runway. My pipelines directly determine Gen-3's capabilities."

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Data Infrastructure Premium:** "Data engineering at an AI company isn't traditional ETL — I'm building training data pipelines for generative models, handling petabytes of video data with quality, diversity, and compliance requirements. That AI-specific expertise commands a premium: $205K base."
2. **Competing Offers:** "I have a Databricks offer at $195K base / $200K RSU and a Snowflake offer at $185K / $250K RSU. Runway's creative AI data challenges are more compelling, but I need $205K base and $250K equity/4yr to offset the liquidity gap."
3. **NYC Market Rate:** "Data engineer comp in NYC at AI companies starts at $180K+ base. I need $195K base minimum to be competitive with the NYC market."
4. **Training Data = Model Quality:** "Every improvement in training data quality translates directly to Gen-3 output quality. My data pipelines are the foundation of Runway's core product — $200K base and $250K equity/4yr."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a data engineer with experience building large-scale data pipelines for ML training — petabyte-scale video/image datasets, data quality systems, and real-time analytics. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $195K / $200K RSU. Runway's creative AI data challenges are where I want to work. To join: $205K base, $245K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $205K, I'm in. Floor is $185K."
