**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Runway own critical product and infrastructure systems end-to-end — from the real-time video editing canvas and collaboration engine to the API gateway serving enterprise customers and the deployment infrastructure for Gen-3. At a company of Runway's size (~150-200 engineers), senior SWEs have enormous scope: you'll architect systems, mentor junior engineers, and make technical decisions that directly shape the product roadmap. Runway's creative AI tools are used by filmmakers, studios, and millions of creators — your engineering decisions have immediate, visible impact on the creative process.

**The Startup Equity Play — Pre-IPO at $4B+ Valuation**
Runway is valued at $4B+ with a clear path toward becoming the dominant AI-native creative tools platform. Senior engineers joining now get meaningful pre-IPO equity at a valuation that could double or triple by IPO. Use competing public-company offers to push equity higher: "Google is offering me $400K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. Runway's equity needs to compensate for the illiquidity risk — I'm looking for $375K/4yr minimum."

**Global Levers**
1. **Technical Leadership Scope:** "As a senior SWE at Runway's scale, I'll own entire product surfaces and make architectural decisions that shape the platform. That scope is Staff-level at a larger company. I'd like $245K base and $360K equity/4yr to reflect the breadth of ownership."
2. **Competing Public Company Offers:** "I have a Meta offer at $225K base / $350K RSU with liquid equity and a proven refresher cadence. Runway is where I want to build, but I need $245K base and $370K equity/4yr to offset the liquidity gap."
3. **NYC Premium:** "Senior engineering comp in NYC needs to reflect the market — Google, Meta, and Datadog all pay $230K+ base for senior SWEs in New York. I'm looking for $240K base minimum."
4. **Product Revenue Impact:** "Runway's enterprise revenue depends on platform reliability and feature velocity. As a senior SWE owning key product surfaces, my work directly drives ARR growth — that revenue impact should be reflected in equity: $370K/4yr with refresh commitments."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a senior engineer who has built production creative tools and real-time collaboration systems at scale. I'm holding offers from Meta at $225K / $350K RSU and a Series C startup at $230K / $400K equity. Runway's creative AI mission is uniquely compelling — I want to build the tools that redefine how people create. To make the move: $245K base, $365K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $50K signing bonus. At $245K, I sign this week. My floor is $220K base."
