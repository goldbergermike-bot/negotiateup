**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Runway build the product infrastructure that brings AI-native creative tools to millions of creators worldwide — from the web-based video editor and real-time collaboration systems to the API platform that enables enterprise customers to integrate Gen-3 video generation into their workflows. Runway is a uniquely creative AI company: you're not just building enterprise SaaS, you're building tools that filmmakers, designers, and artists use to create things that were impossible six months ago. The engineering culture values shipping speed, product intuition, and deep technical ownership — SWEs at Runway own entire product surfaces from backend to frontend.

**The Startup Equity Play — Pre-IPO at $4B+ Valuation**
Runway is valued at $4B+ and growing rapidly as generative video becomes the next frontier of AI. Unlike large public companies, Runway offers meaningful pre-IPO equity that could appreciate significantly. Use this: "Runway's $4B+ valuation is early innings for generative video — I want my equity to reflect that I'm joining before the liquidity event." Push for larger equity grants by emphasizing the illiquidity risk of private shares compared to public RSUs.

**Global Levers**
1. **Creative AI Product Impact:** "Runway's product is used by Hollywood studios, ad agencies, and millions of individual creators. As a SWE building the product layer, my work directly drives user growth and enterprise revenue. I'd like $215K base and $275K equity/4yr to reflect that product impact."
2. **Competing Offers from Public Companies:** "I have a Google offer at $190K base / $250K RSU/4yr with fully liquid equity. Runway's mission is more compelling, but the liquidity gap is real — I need $215K base and $280K equity/4yr or a $40K signing bonus to bridge the difference."
3. **NYC Cost of Living:** "New York City compensation needs to reflect the cost of living reality. $160K base is Bay Area mid-level for a SWE — in NYC, I need $200K+ base to be competitive."
4. **Pre-IPO Risk Premium:** "I'm trading liquid public equity for pre-IPO shares. That risk deserves compensation — I'd like an additional $50K in equity or a $35K signing bonus to offset the illiquidity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building Runway's creative tools platform — AI-native video editing is the future and Runway is defining it. I'm currently weighing an offer from Google at $190K base / $250K RSU with liquid equity. Runway is where I want to be, but I need the economics to work: $210K base, $275K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $210K base, I'll sign this week. My floor is $190K base — below that, the Google liquid equity is too strong."
