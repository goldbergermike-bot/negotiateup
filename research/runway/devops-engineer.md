**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Runway manage the infrastructure that serves real-time AI inference to millions of creators — GPU clusters for model training, edge deployment for low-latency video generation, CI/CD pipelines for rapid model deployment, and the monitoring systems that ensure 99.9%+ uptime for enterprise customers. At an AI company, DevOps is unusually complex: you're managing GPU fleets, optimizing inference serving costs, deploying models that are gigabytes in size, and scaling infrastructure for workloads that are fundamentally different from traditional web services. Runway's infrastructure must handle bursty video generation workloads with sub-second latency expectations.

**Level Mapping:** Runway DevOps Engineer = Google L3-L4 SRE = Meta Production Engineer IC3-IC4 = Amazon SDE/DevOps II
