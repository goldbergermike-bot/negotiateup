### Staff Software Engineer | Runway Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive AI Startup Comp + Pre-IPO Equity | $4B+ Valuation | NYC HQ | Creative AI Pioneer | Technical Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $220K-$280K | $250K-$500K | — | $283K-$405K |
| San Francisco | $220K-$280K | $250K-$500K | — | $283K-$405K |
| Remote US | $198K-$252K | $225K-$450K | — | $254K-$365K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Staff Software Engineers at Runway are the technical backbone of the company — setting architectural direction, driving cross-team technical initiatives, and making the highest-leverage engineering decisions. At Runway's scale, Staff engineers are among the most senior technical ICs: you'll define the platform architecture for real-time AI inference, design the systems that scale Gen-3 to millions of concurrent users, and establish engineering best practices across the organization. Staff SWEs at Runway operate with near-VP-level technical authority in a company where technical excellence is the core differentiator.

**The Startup Equity Play — Pre-IPO at $4B+ Valuation**
Staff engineers should negotiate aggressively for equity — at this level, you're making decisions that directly drive company valuation. Push for equity grants that reflect your impact: "As a Staff engineer setting architectural direction, my decisions will determine whether Runway can scale to 10x its current user base. The equity should reflect that leverage — $475K/4yr minimum."

**Global Levers**
1. **Architectural Authority:** "Staff-level engineers at Runway define the technical roadmap. I'll own architecture decisions that determine platform scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency. That's founding-engineer-level impact at a $4B+ company — $275K base and $475K equity/4yr."
2. **Cross-Team Technical Leadership:** "I'll drive technical initiatives across multiple teams and establish engineering standards for the organization. At a public company, this scope would be Principal Engineer. I need $270K base and $480K equity/4yr."
3. **Competing Staff Offers:** "I have a Google L6 offer at $260K base / $600K RSU and a Stripe Staff offer at $270K / $500K RSU. Runway's creative AI mission is where I want to build, but the equity gap needs closing: $275K base and $490K equity/4yr with refresh guarantees."
4. **Scaling Expertise Premium:** "I've scaled systems from thousands to millions of users at [previous company]. That scaling expertise is exactly what Runway needs as Gen-3 adoption accelerates — $275K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a Staff-level engineer with experience scaling creative tools and real-time systems to millions of users. I'm holding offers from Google L6 at $260K / $600K RSU and Stripe Staff at $270K / $500K RSU. Runway's vision of AI-native creative tools is the most exciting problem in tech. To join: $275K base, $480K equity/4yr, and a $65K signing bonus. At $275K, I'm in. My floor is $250K base."
