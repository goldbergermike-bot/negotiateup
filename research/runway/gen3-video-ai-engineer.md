### Gen-3 Video AI Engineer | Runway Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive AI Startup Comp + Pre-IPO Equity | $4B+ Valuation | NYC HQ | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15-30% ML PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $210K-$285K | $200K-$450K | — | $260K-$398K |
| San Francisco | $210K-$285K | $200K-$450K | — | $260K-$398K |
| Remote US | $189K-$257K | $180K-$405K | — | $234K-$358K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The Gen-3 Video AI Engineer is Runway's signature role — the position at the absolute core of what makes Runway the leader in AI-native video generation. You will build and optimize the Gen-3 Alpha model architecture: video diffusion pipelines, temporal consistency systems, motion modeling, text-to-video conditioning, and the real-time inference infrastructure that enables filmmakers and creators to generate cinematic-quality video from text prompts. Runway invented the creative AI tools category with Gen-1 and Gen-2, and Gen-3 represents a generational leap in video generation quality. This role requires a rare combination of deep generative modeling expertise, video understanding, and production engineering — making it one of the most sought-after positions in the AI industry. The +15-30% ML Premium reflects the extreme scarcity of engineers with video diffusion model experience.

**Level Mapping:** Runway Gen-3 Video AI Engineer = Google L5-L6 Research Engineer = Meta AI Research Engineer IC5-IC6 = OpenAI Research Engineer = Stability AI Senior ML Engineer

**The Startup Equity Play — Pre-IPO at $4B+ Valuation**
Runway is valued at $4B+ and growing rapidly as generative video becomes the next frontier of AI. Unlike large public companies, Runway offers meaningful pre-IPO equity that could appreciate significantly if the company continues its trajectory toward becoming the Adobe of AI-native creative tools. Use this to your advantage: "Runway's $4B+ valuation represents early innings for generative video — this market will be worth tens of billions. I want my equity to reflect that I'm joining at this stage, not after the liquidity event." The base salary at Runway is competitive with top AI companies in NYC, and the equity provides asymmetric upside. Push for higher equity grants by emphasizing the illiquidity discount — you're taking real risk by holding private shares.

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Scarcity:** "There are fewer than 500 engineers in the world with production experience building video diffusion models. I've built [temporal consistency systems / video generation pipelines / motion modeling architectures] at scale, and that expertise is in extraordinary demand from Stability, Pika, and OpenAI Sora. I'm looking for $275K base and $425K equity/4yr to reflect this scarcity."
2. **Gen-3 Technical Impact:** "Gen-3 is Runway's flagship product and core value driver. The quality of the video generation model directly determines Runway's market position and enterprise revenue. As someone who will directly improve Gen-3's output quality and inference speed, my work has outsized revenue impact — $275K base and $440K equity/4yr."
3. **Competing Video AI Offers:** "I have competing offers from Pika at $250K base / $400K equity and Stability AI at $230K base / $350K equity for video generation work. Runway is the leader in this space, which is why it's my first choice — but I need the comp to be competitive: $280K base and $430K equity/4yr."
4. **NYC Cost of Living Premium:** "New York City has the highest cost of living in the US for tech workers. My base needs to reflect NYC economics — $275K minimum to be competitive with what I'd earn at comparable roles at Google NYC or Meta NYC."
5. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "I'm joining a $4B+ company before its liquidity event. That illiquidity deserves compensation — I'd like front-loaded vesting (35% year one) and a commitment to equity refreshes as the valuation grows. $440K equity/4yr with milestone-based acceleration tied to Gen-3 model milestones."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a video AI engineer who has spent the last several years building exactly what Runway needs — video diffusion models, temporal consistency systems, and real-time inference for generative video. I'm holding an offer from Pika at $250K base / $400K equity and a Google DeepMind offer at $280K base / $500K RSU for video generation research. Both are strong, but Runway is where I want to be — Gen-3 is the best video generation system in the world, and I want to make it even better. To make the move, I need $280K base, $430K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $60K signing bonus. The ML Premium applies — video diffusion expertise is among the rarest skill sets in AI. At $280K base, I sign immediately. My floor is $250K base — below that, the Google liquid equity and research budget make it the rational choice, even though my passion is with Runway's creative tools mission."
