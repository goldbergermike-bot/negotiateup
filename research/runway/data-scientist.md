**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Runway analyze model performance, user behavior, and product metrics to drive decisions about model development priorities, product features, and go-to-market strategy. In a generative AI company, data science has unique depth: you're evaluating model output quality through quantitative metrics (FID, FVD, CLIP scores), designing A/B experiments for model improvements, analyzing creator workflows to inform product direction, and building the analytical frameworks that connect model capabilities to business outcomes. This is data science at the intersection of art and AI.

**Level Mapping:** Runway Data Scientist = Google L3-L4 Data Scientist = Meta Data Scientist IC3-IC4 = Amazon Applied Scientist

**The Startup Equity Play — Pre-IPO at $4B+ Valuation**
Data scientists who can bridge model evaluation and business metrics are especially valuable at AI companies. Your analyses directly inform model development investment decisions worth millions of dollars.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Model Evaluation Expertise:** "Data science at a generative AI company requires deep understanding of model evaluation metrics — FID, FVD, CLIP scores, human preference evaluation. I bring that specialized expertise plus traditional product analytics. $210K base and $260K equity/4yr."
2. **Business Impact Analytics:** "My analyses directly inform which model improvements to prioritize — decisions that drive user growth and enterprise revenue. That strategic impact justifies $205K base."
3. **Competing Offers:** "I have a Spotify offer at $195K / $180K RSU and a Meta offer at $185K / $250K RSU. Runway's unique intersection of AI and creativity is compelling, but I need $210K base to offset the liquidity risk."
4. **NYC Premium:** "Data scientist comp in NYC starts at $175K+ at top companies. I'm looking for $200K base minimum."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a data scientist with experience in both ML model evaluation and product analytics — I can bridge the gap between model quality metrics and business outcomes. I'm holding a Meta offer at $185K / $250K RSU. Runway's creative AI mission is uniquely exciting. To join: $210K base, $255K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. Floor is $185K."
