**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Runway define the roadmap for AI-native creative tools that are redefining how humans create visual content. You'll decide which Gen-3 capabilities to ship, design the enterprise product strategy, prioritize between model improvements and product features, and translate creator needs into technical requirements. Runway's PM role is uniquely challenging: you need deep intuition for creative workflows AND understanding of generative AI capabilities and limitations. You're shipping products where the underlying technology improves faster than the product can adapt — requiring PMs who can think in quarters while building for years.

**Level Mapping:** Runway PM = Google L5 PM = Meta PM IC5 = Amazon Senior PM-Tech

**The Startup Equity Play — Pre-IPO at $4B+ Valuation**
PMs at Runway directly shape product strategy and go-to-market — your roadmap decisions determine revenue growth trajectory. Negotiate equity that reflects your strategic impact.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Product Strategy Expertise:** "Shipping AI products requires a fundamentally different PM approach — managing non-deterministic outputs, setting quality bars for generated content, and building trust with creative professionals who have high standards. I bring that AI product expertise: $230K base and $310K equity/4yr."
2. **Creative Industry Understanding:** "Runway's enterprise customers are studios, agencies, and media companies. I understand creative workflows and can translate creator needs into product requirements that drive enterprise revenue — $225K base."
3. **Revenue Impact:** "PM decisions at Runway directly drive ARR — which features to build, which segments to target, how to position Gen-3 for enterprise. That revenue impact justifies $230K base and $305K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offers:** "I have a Google PM offer at $215K / $350K RSU and an Figma PM offer at $220K / $300K RSU. Runway's creative AI product challenge is uniquely compelling, but I need $230K base to offset liquidity risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a PM with deep experience in creative tools and AI products. I'm holding a Google PM offer at $215K / $350K RSU. Runway is building the future of creative work, and I want to drive that product strategy. To join: $230K base, $305K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. Floor is $205K."
