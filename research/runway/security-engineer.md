**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Runway protect both the technical infrastructure and the AI models themselves — a dual mandate that makes this role uniquely complex at a generative AI company. You'll secure the model serving infrastructure, implement content safety systems that prevent harmful video generation, protect intellectual property and training data, ensure enterprise compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, content licensing), and defend against adversarial attacks on the generation models. AI security is a nascent field — there's no established playbook for securing video generation systems, making this role both challenging and high-impact.

**Level Mapping:** Runway Security Engineer = Google L4-L5 Security Engineer = Meta Security Engineer IC4-IC5 = AWS Security Engineer II-III
