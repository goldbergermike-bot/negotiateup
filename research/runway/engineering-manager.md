### Engineering Manager | Runway Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive AI Startup Comp + Pre-IPO Equity | $4B+ Valuation | NYC HQ | Creative AI Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $210K-$275K | $200K-$450K | — | $260K-$388K |
| San Francisco | $210K-$275K | $200K-$450K | — | $260K-$388K |
| Remote US | $189K-$248K | $180K-$405K | — | $234K-$349K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Runway lead teams that build the products and infrastructure powering AI-native creative tools for millions. At Runway's scale, EMs have unusually broad scope — you might own an entire product surface (the video editor, the API platform, model serving infrastructure) with a team of 5-12 engineers. EMs at Runway need deep technical credibility: the team builds cutting-edge AI products, and effective leadership requires understanding generative models, real-time systems, and creative workflows. The role combines people management, technical direction, and product strategy — Runway's EMs are player-coaches who can review model architecture PRs and set quarterly roadmaps.

**The Startup Equity Play — Pre-IPO at $4B+ Valuation**
Engineering managers at high-growth AI startups should push for equity commensurate with their organizational impact. Your team's output directly drives company valuation — negotiate accordingly.

**Global Levers**
1. **Organizational Leverage:** "As an EM at Runway, I'll multiply the output of 5-12 engineers building core products. My organizational impact is measured in team velocity, not individual contributions — that multiplier effect justifies $270K base and $430K equity/4yr."
2. **Technical + Management Premium:** "Runway needs EMs who can review model architecture decisions AND build high-performing teams. That dual competency is rare — most EMs are either technical or people-focused. I bring both: $265K base."
3. **Competing EM Offers:** "I have a Google M1 offer at $250K / $450K RSU and a Stripe EM offer at $260K / $400K RSU. Runway's creative AI mission is where I want to lead, but I need $270K base and $440K equity/4yr."
4. **Retention Risk Management:** "Great EMs reduce attrition and accelerate hiring. The cost of losing and replacing an engineer at Runway is $300K+. My ability to retain and recruit talent has measurable ROI — $265K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm an engineering manager with experience leading ML infrastructure and product engineering teams at [previous company]. I'm holding a Google M1 offer at $250K / $450K RSU and a startup EM offer at $260K / $400K equity. Runway's creative AI vision is where I want to build and lead. To join: $270K base, $435K equity/4yr, and a $55K signing bonus. At $270K, I commit immediately. Floor is $245K."
