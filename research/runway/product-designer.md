**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Runway are designing the interface between humans and AI creativity — arguably the most exciting design challenge in tech. You'll design the video generation canvas, the model interaction patterns, the real-time collaboration UX, and the creative workflows that make AI tools feel intuitive to filmmakers, designers, and artists. Runway's product is inherently visual and creative, meaning designers have outsized influence on the product experience. This isn't traditional SaaS design — you're inventing new interaction paradigms for AI-generated content, designing for non-deterministic outputs, and creating UX patterns that don't exist anywhere else.

**Level Mapping:** Runway Product Designer = Google L4-L5 UX Designer = Meta Product Designer IC4-IC5 = Figma Senior Product Designer

**The Startup Equity Play — Pre-IPO at $4B+ Valuation**
At a creative tools company, design quality is a primary differentiator. Push for compensation that reflects design's outsized impact on Runway's product-market fit and brand.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI UX Innovation:** "Designing AI-native creative tools requires inventing new interaction paradigms — there's no playbook for designing video generation UX. I bring the creative problem-solving and AI product design experience to pioneer these patterns. $210K base and $250K equity/4yr."
2. **Creative Tools Background:** "I've designed creative tools at [Figma/Adobe/Canva] and understand how creators think and work. That domain expertise is critical for Runway's product quality — $205K base."
3. **Brand & Product Differentiation:** "Runway's design quality is a key differentiator — the product looks and feels premium compared to competitors. Maintaining that design bar requires top talent: $210K base."
4. **Competing Offers:** "I have a Figma offer at $200K / $250K RSU and a Canva offer at $195K / $200K RSU. Runway's AI-native creative tools design challenge is more compelling, but I need $210K base to make the move."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a product designer who has spent years designing creative tools and understands both the creative process and AI interaction design. I'm holding a Figma offer at $200K / $250K RSU. Runway's AI-native video tools are the most exciting design challenge in tech. To join: $210K base, $250K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. Floor is $190K."
