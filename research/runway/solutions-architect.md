Solutions Architects at Runway bridge the gap between Gen-3's AI capabilities and enterprise customer needs — designing integration architectures for studios, media companies, ad agencies, and creative platforms that want to embed AI video generation into their workflows. You'll work with Runway's API platform, design custom deployment architectures, solve enterprise-scale technical challenges, and serve as the trusted technical advisor for Runway's highest-value customers. As Runway scales its enterprise business, SAs are the tip of the spear — your technical credibility and solution design directly close six- and seven-figure deals.

3. **Pre-Sales Technical Leadership:** "I reduce sales cycle length and increase close rates through deep technical engagement. That's measurable revenue acceleration — $220K base."
4. **Competing Offers:** "I have a Databricks SA offer at $210K / $250K RSU and an AWS SA offer at $200K / $200K RSU. Runway's creative AI enterprise market is more exciting, but I need $220K base."
