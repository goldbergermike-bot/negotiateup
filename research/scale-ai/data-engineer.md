### Data Engineer | Scale AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | AI Data Infrastructure Leader | $2B Secondary Market Liquidity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $168K-$210K | $150K-$265K | — | $206K-$276K |
| New York | $173K-$221K | $150K-$265K | — | $211K-$287K |
| Washington DC | $176K-$227K | $150K-$265K | — | $214K-$293K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Scale AI build the pipelines that flow the world's most critical AI training data — from raw input through RLHF annotation, quality verification, and delivery to customers including OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and the US Department of Defense. At $14B+ valuation, Scale's data engineering challenges are uniquely consequential: you are building the systems that curate, process, and deliver the training data that determines whether frontier AI models are accurate, safe, and aligned with human values. Every data pipeline you build directly impacts the quality of AI systems used by billions of people. Scale's dual customer base means your pipelines must handle both commercial AI lab scale (petabytes of training data) and government-grade data integrity requirements simultaneously.

**$2B Secondary Market — Private Equity as Good as Cash**
Scale AI has a $2B+ secondary market for employee shares — meaning your pre-IPO equity is functionally liquid. You don't need to wait for an IPO to realize value from your equity grants. Scale's secondary market means you can sell shares on established secondary platforms at current valuation ($14B+), providing liquidity that most pre-IPO companies cannot offer. When comparing Scale's equity to public company RSUs, factor in that Scale's shares are tradeable on secondary markets at predictable valuations. This transforms the typical 'pre-IPO equity gamble' into near-cash compensation. Negotiate equity aggressively: "Scale's $2B secondary market means this equity is as liquid as public RSUs. I should be compensated at public-company equity levels, not startup-discount levels."

**Global Levers**
1. **RLHF Pipeline Specialization:** "Data engineers who understand RLHF data pipelines — the specific data flow patterns for human feedback collection, preference ranking aggregation, reward model training data, and alignment evaluation datasets — are a tiny subset of the data engineering market. My experience with [RLHF data systems/human feedback pipelines/preference data architecture] directly maps to Scale's highest-growth data product line."
2. **Training Data Curation at Scale:** "Building data pipelines that curate AI training datasets at petabyte scale while maintaining statistical quality guarantees is fundamentally harder than traditional data engineering. Every data quality issue in my pipeline propagates directly into customer AI models. My experience with [large-scale data quality/ML training data pipelines/data curation systems] ensures Scale's core data product maintains its quality premium."
3. **Evaluation Dataset Management:** "Scale's expansion into AI evaluation requires entirely new data pipeline patterns — managing evaluation benchmarks, test datasets, model comparison data, and safety evaluation corpora. My experience with [ML evaluation data/benchmark dataset management/test data infrastructure] positions me to build the data foundation for Scale's GenAI evaluation platform."
4. **Government Data Pipeline Compliance:** "Building data pipelines for government customers requires data lineage tracking, chain-of-custody documentation, and compliance with classified data handling requirements that commercial pipelines don't need. My experience with [government data systems/classified data pipelines/NIST data handling] enables Scale to serve its government customers without building a separate data engineering team."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building the data pipelines that power the world's AI training infrastructure at Scale. I'm evaluating offers from [Databricks/Snowflake/Google] in the $265K-$280K TC range. My target for Scale is $200K base with $250K/4yr equity, putting my TC at $263K. My specific expertise in [RLHF data pipelines/training data curation/evaluation dataset management] directly maps to Scale's core data infrastructure needs. My accept-at floor is $190K base with $220K/4yr equity. I'd also like to discuss whether there's a data engineering on-call compensation structure for pipeline reliability."
