### DevOps Engineer | Scale AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | AI Data Infrastructure Leader | $2B Secondary Market Liquidity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $172K-$215K | $160K-$282K | — | $212K-$286K |
| New York | $177K-$226K | $160K-$282K | — | $217K-$297K |
| Washington DC | $181K-$232K | $160K-$282K | — | $221K-$303K |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Scale AI build and maintain the infrastructure backbone that processes billions of data labeling tasks, powers GPU clusters for model evaluation, and deploys the Donovan AI platform to government/defense environments with the highest security and reliability standards. At $14B+ valuation, Scale's infrastructure challenges are uniquely demanding: you must engineer data pipelines that handle petabyte-scale annotation workflows for commercial AI labs like OpenAI and Meta, while simultaneously maintaining FedRAMP-compliant deployment environments for DoD and intelligence agency contracts. The dual-infrastructure mandate — commercial velocity and government-grade reliability — makes Scale's DevOps role significantly more complex and valuable than equivalent positions at single-market companies.

**$2B Secondary Market — Private Equity as Good as Cash**
Scale AI has a $2B+ secondary market for employee shares — meaning your pre-IPO equity is functionally liquid. You don't need to wait for an IPO to realize value from your equity grants. Scale's secondary market means you can sell shares on established secondary platforms at current valuation ($14B+), providing liquidity that most pre-IPO companies cannot offer. When comparing Scale's equity to public company RSUs, factor in that Scale's shares are tradeable on secondary markets at predictable valuations. This transforms the typical 'pre-IPO equity gamble' into near-cash compensation. Negotiate equity aggressively: "Scale's $2B secondary market means this equity is as liquid as public RSUs. I should be compensated at public-company equity levels, not startup-discount levels."

**Global Levers**
1. **Data Pipeline Scale Premium:** "Scale's infrastructure processes billions of data labeling tasks across petabyte-scale datasets. DevOps engineers who can build and maintain data pipelines at this scale — spanning annotation orchestration, GPU cluster management for evaluation, and multi-cloud deployment — are exceptionally rare. My experience with [Kubernetes at scale/GPU infrastructure/petabyte data pipelines] directly accelerates Scale's infrastructure roadmap."
2. **Government Deployment Expertise:** "Deploying AI platforms into FedRAMP-authorized, IL4/IL5, and air-gapped government environments requires specialized DevOps knowledge that takes years to develop. My experience with [FedRAMP deployment/government cloud/DISA STIG compliance] is directly applicable to Scale's Donovan platform deployment. This government infrastructure expertise commands a 10-15% premium over commercial-only DevOps roles."
3. **GPU Infrastructure Scarcity:** "Managing GPU clusters for AI model evaluation at Scale's volume requires expertise in GPU scheduling, CUDA optimization, and AI-specific infrastructure patterns. DevOps engineers with genuine GPU infrastructure experience are among the most scarce hires in the industry. My background in [GPU cluster management/ML infrastructure/AI compute optimization] puts me in a talent pool that every AI company is competing for."
4. **Uptime Revenue Impact:** "Every hour of downtime on Scale's data labeling platform directly impacts revenue from AI lab contracts and SLA commitments to government customers. My reliability engineering experience — maintaining [X nines] availability for [critical infrastructure systems] — directly protects Scale's revenue and customer relationships."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about Scale's infrastructure challenges — building the data pipelines and deployment systems that power both commercial AI labs and government AI platforms. I'm evaluating offers from [Google SRE/Amazon/Cloudflare] in the $270K-$290K TC range. My target for Scale is $205K base with $265K/4yr equity, putting my TC at $271K. My specific expertise in [GPU infrastructure/government deployment/petabyte-scale data pipelines] maps directly to Scale's highest-priority infrastructure needs. My accept-at floor is $195K base with $230K/4yr equity. I'd also like to discuss on-call compensation structure given the 24/7 nature of Scale's data platform."
