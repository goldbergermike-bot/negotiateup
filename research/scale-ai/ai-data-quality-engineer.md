### AI Data Quality Engineer | Scale AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | AI Data Infrastructure Leader | $2B Secondary Market Liquidity | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+20-35% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $215K-$268K | $320K-$558K | — | $295K-$408K |
| New York | $221K-$281K | $320K-$558K | — | $301K-$421K |
| Washington DC | $226K-$289K | $320K-$558K | — | $306K-$431K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The AI Data Quality Engineer is Scale AI's signature role — the engineer who ensures that the data powering the world's most consequential AI systems is accurate, safe, and aligned with human values. You are building the RLHF pipeline engineering systems that determine whether frontier AI models learn the right behaviors, the evaluation frameworks that measure whether AI is safe for deployment, the data quality systems that detect and correct errors across billions of annotations, and the model safety evaluation infrastructure that governments and AI labs depend on to assess AI risk. At $14B+ valuation, this role sits at the exact intersection of Scale's commercial AI lab business and government/defense contracts — both customer segments need the highest possible data quality, and both are willing to pay premium prices for it. The +20-35% Agentic AI Premium reflects that AI Data Quality Engineers who can build autonomous, self-improving quality systems are the single scarcest role in AI infrastructure. This is the role that Alexandr Wang built Scale AI to enable: ensuring that the data foundation of AI is trustworthy.

**Level Mapping:** Scale AI Data Quality Engineer = Google L5 ML Engineer = Meta ML Engineer (IC5) = OpenAI Research Engineer = Anthropic AI Safety Engineer = DeepMind Research Engineer (no direct equivalent — this role is unique to Scale's AI data infrastructure model)

**$2B Secondary Market — Private Equity as Good as Cash**
Scale AI has a $2B+ secondary market for employee shares — meaning your pre-IPO equity is functionally liquid. You don't need to wait for an IPO to realize value from your equity grants. Scale's secondary market means you can sell shares on established secondary platforms at current valuation ($14B+), providing liquidity that most pre-IPO companies cannot offer. When comparing Scale's equity to public company RSUs, factor in that Scale's shares are tradeable on secondary markets at predictable valuations. This transforms the typical 'pre-IPO equity gamble' into near-cash compensation. Negotiate equity aggressively: "Scale's $2B secondary market means this equity is as liquid as public RSUs. I should be compensated at public-company equity levels, not startup-discount levels."

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Scarcity Premium:** "AI Data Quality Engineer is Scale's signature role — it defines Scale's core value proposition to every customer from OpenAI to the DoD. Engineers who combine RLHF pipeline engineering, evaluation framework design, and large-scale data quality systems expertise are functionally unique in the market. There is no established talent pipeline for this role — every hire is a custom acquisition. My equity target of $520K-$558K/4yr reflects this scarcity premium and the direct revenue impact of this position. I'm benchmarking against [Anthropic AI Safety/OpenAI Research Engineer/DeepMind] roles that compete for the same talent."
2. **RLHF Pipeline Engineering — AI Alignment Infrastructure:** "The RLHF pipelines I build at Scale determine whether frontier AI models learn to be helpful, harmless, and honest. This is not abstract — the data quality of Scale's RLHF output directly shapes the alignment properties of models used by billions of people. My experience with [RLHF pipeline architecture/preference data collection systems/reward model training data/human feedback quality assurance] is the technical foundation of AI alignment at scale. The market value of this expertise has increased 40-60% in the past 18 months."
3. **Evaluation Framework Design — Defining AI Safety Metrics:** "Scale's evaluation frameworks are becoming the industry standard for measuring AI model safety, accuracy, and capability. I can design the evaluation systems that governments and AI labs use to determine whether models are safe for deployment — including adversarial robustness testing, bias detection, hallucination measurement, and capability benchmarking. My experience with [AI evaluation methodology/safety benchmarking/red-team evaluation design] directly shapes Scale's most strategically important product line."
4. **Labeling Quality Assurance at Scale — The Revenue Foundation:** "Scale's entire business depends on the claim that its data is higher quality than alternatives. I build the systems that make this claim provably true — automated quality detection across billions of annotations, annotator performance evaluation, inter-rater reliability measurement, and data distribution analysis. A 0.5% improvement in labeling quality across Scale's platform translates directly to improved customer retention and contract expansion. My track record of [specific quality metric improvements] demonstrates measurable impact on the metrics that drive Scale's revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply aligned with Scale's mission and this signature role. Building the RLHF pipelines, evaluation frameworks, and data quality systems that determine whether AI is safe and accurate is exactly the work I want to be doing. I'm evaluating offers from Anthropic ($380K TC as AI Safety Engineer), OpenAI ($395K TC as Research Engineer), and DeepMind ($370K TC), all of which compete for the same skillset. My target for Scale is $258K base with $530K/4yr equity, putting my TC at $390K. Given Scale's $2B secondary market, I'm treating this equity as liquid and benchmarking against public company RSU grants plus the pre-IPO appreciation upside. My specific expertise in [RLHF pipeline engineering/evaluation framework design/data quality ML systems/model safety evaluation] maps directly to Scale's signature role requirements. My accept-at floor is $242K base with $460K/4yr equity — below that, the Anthropic and OpenAI offers become the dominant choice. I'd also like to discuss a front-loaded vesting schedule (40/20/20/20) given the immediate impact I expect to deliver in this role."
