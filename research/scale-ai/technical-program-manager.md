### Technical Program Manager | Scale AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | AI Data Infrastructure Leader | $2B Secondary Market Liquidity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $168K-$210K | $145K-$258K | — | $204K-$275K |
| New York | $173K-$221K | $145K-$258K | — | $209K-$285K |
| Washington DC | $176K-$227K | $145K-$258K | — | $213K-$291K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Scale AI coordinate the most complex cross-functional programs in AI infrastructure — orchestrating workstreams that span commercial AI lab contracts (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic), government and defense programs (DoD, NSCAI, intelligence agencies), and internal platform development across data labeling, RLHF pipelines, model evaluation, and the GenAI Platform. At $14B+ valuation, Scale's TPM role is uniquely demanding because you are managing programs across customers with radically different timelines, security requirements, and success metrics. A single TPM might coordinate a rapid commercial delivery for an AI lab alongside a multi-year government contract with classified security requirements — all while ensuring the underlying platform evolves to serve both.

**Level Mapping:** Scale TPM = Google L4-L5 TPM = Meta TPM (IC4-IC5) = Amazon Sr. TPM = Apple TPM = Microsoft Sr. PM 62-64

**$2B Secondary Market — Private Equity as Good as Cash**
Scale AI has a $2B+ secondary market for employee shares — meaning your pre-IPO equity is functionally liquid. You don't need to wait for an IPO to realize value from your equity grants. Scale's secondary market means you can sell shares on established secondary platforms at current valuation ($14B+), providing liquidity that most pre-IPO companies cannot offer. When comparing Scale's equity to public company RSUs, factor in that Scale's shares are tradeable on secondary markets at predictable valuations. This transforms the typical 'pre-IPO equity gamble' into near-cash compensation. Negotiate equity aggressively: "Scale's $2B secondary market means this equity is as liquid as public RSUs. I should be compensated at public-company equity levels, not startup-discount levels."

**Global Levers**
1. **Cross-Customer Program Complexity:** "TPMs at Scale coordinate programs spanning commercial AI labs, government/defense contracts, and internal platform development — three customer segments with fundamentally different delivery cadences, security postures, and success metrics. This tri-segment program complexity far exceeds the scope of a single-product TPM role. My experience managing [multi-stakeholder/cross-segment/government + commercial] programs directly maps to Scale's coordination challenges."
2. **Government Contract Delivery Premium:** "Government program management requires understanding of FAR/DFAR compliance, CDRL delivery schedules, and government milestone-based payment structures. My experience with [DoD program management/government contract delivery/cleared program execution] enables me to manage Scale's highest-value government programs from day one. Government-experienced TPMs command a 10-15% premium because the domain knowledge takes years to develop."
3. **Platform Velocity Impact:** "The TPM who coordinates Scale's platform development across engineering, product, and customer delivery teams directly determines the company's execution velocity. My track record of [specific program delivery achievements — reduced delivery timelines, improved cross-team coordination] translates to measurably faster product velocity at Scale."
4. **AI Lab Delivery Relationships:** "I bring program management relationships and credibility with [specific AI labs/enterprise customers] that enable smoother delivery coordination. A TPM who already understands how [OpenAI/Anthropic/Meta] operates internally can coordinate Scale's delivery to these customers with minimal ramp-up — that relationship capital has direct value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the coordination challenges at Scale — managing programs that span the world's leading AI labs and US national security agencies simultaneously. I'm evaluating offers from [Google/Amazon/Microsoft] in the $260K-$280K TC range. My target for Scale is $200K base with $240K/4yr equity, putting my TC at $260K. My specific program management experience with [government contracts/AI lab delivery/multi-segment coordination] makes me immediately productive across Scale's program portfolio. My accept-at floor is $190K base with $210K/4yr equity. I'd also like to discuss how equity refreshes work for TPMs who successfully deliver high-impact programs."
