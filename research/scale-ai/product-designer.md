**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Scale AI shape the interfaces through which the world's most consequential AI systems are labeled, evaluated, and deployed. You are designing the data labeling UX used by hundreds of thousands of annotators worldwide, the evaluation dashboards that AI researchers use to assess model safety and accuracy, and the Donovan interface through which US military and intelligence analysts interact with AI. At $14B+ valuation, Scale's design challenges are uniquely complex — you must make billion-scale data operations intuitive for annotators, AI researchers, and government analysts simultaneously. The quality of your design work directly impacts data quality, which directly impacts the safety and accuracy of frontier AI models.

**$2B Secondary Market — Private Equity as Good as Cash**
Scale AI has a $2B+ secondary market for employee shares — meaning your pre-IPO equity is functionally liquid. You don't need to wait for an IPO to realize value from your equity grants. Scale's secondary market means you can sell shares on established secondary platforms at current valuation ($14B+), providing liquidity that most pre-IPO companies cannot offer. When comparing Scale's equity to public company RSUs, factor in that Scale's shares are tradeable on secondary markets at predictable valuations. This transforms the typical 'pre-IPO equity gamble' into near-cash compensation. Negotiate equity aggressively: "Scale's $2B secondary market means this equity is as liquid as public RSUs. I should be compensated at public-company equity levels, not startup-discount levels."

**Global Levers**
1. **Data Labeling UX Impact:** "The quality of Scale's data labeling interface directly determines annotation accuracy, which directly determines AI model quality for every customer from OpenAI to the DoD. A 1% improvement in labeling UX efficiency across Scale's annotator workforce translates to millions of dollars in throughput gains. My design experience in [complex workflow tools/annotation interfaces/data-heavy UX] is directly tied to Scale's core revenue engine."
2. **Multi-Audience Design Complexity:** "Scale's design challenges span three radically different user populations: annotators performing data labeling at scale, AI researchers evaluating model outputs, and government analysts using Donovan for national security applications. Designing for this range of users and security contexts is far more complex than a single-product design role. This complexity premium should be reflected in my equity grant."
3. **Evaluation Dashboard Expertise:** "Scale's expansion into AI evaluation and RLHF tooling requires entirely new design patterns for model assessment, data quality visualization, and evaluation workflow management. My experience with [data visualization/ML tooling UX/complex dashboard design] positions me to lead this emerging product area where design is the primary differentiator."
4. **Government UX Clearance Premium:** "Designing for government/defense users requires understanding of classified information handling, accessibility compliance (Section 508), and government UX standards. My experience with [government design systems/FedRAMP interfaces/defense UX] is directly applicable to Donovan and commands a premium in the design market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the design challenges at Scale — making billion-scale data operations intuitive across annotators, AI researchers, and government analysts. I'm evaluating offers from [Google/Figma/Notion] in the $240K-$260K TC range. My target for Scale is $190K base with $210K/4yr equity, putting my TC at $243K. Given the multi-audience design complexity and my specific experience in [data labeling UX/evaluation dashboards/government interfaces], this reflects the scope of the role. My accept-at floor is $180K base with $180K/4yr equity. I'd also appreciate a $25K-$35K signing bonus to bridge the first-year equity cliff."
