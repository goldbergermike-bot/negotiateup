**Negotiation DNA**
Scale AI is the foundational data infrastructure company powering the world's most advanced AI systems — from OpenAI to the US Department of Defense. As a Software Engineer at Scale, you are building the platforms that label, curate, and evaluate the data that determines whether frontier AI models succeed or fail. At a $14B+ valuation with both commercial AI lab contracts and stable government revenue streams, Scale offers a uniquely de-risked pre-IPO compensation profile where your equity is functionally liquid through a $2B secondary market. The dual customer base — hyperscale AI labs and US defense/intelligence agencies — means Scale's growth trajectory is insulated from any single market downturn.

**$2B Secondary Market — Private Equity as Good as Cash**
Scale AI has a $2B+ secondary market for employee shares — meaning your pre-IPO equity is functionally liquid. You don't need to wait for an IPO to realize value from your equity grants. Scale's secondary market means you can sell shares on established secondary platforms at current valuation ($14B+), providing liquidity that most pre-IPO companies cannot offer. When comparing Scale's equity to public company RSUs, factor in that Scale's shares are tradeable on secondary markets at predictable valuations. This transforms the typical 'pre-IPO equity gamble' into near-cash compensation. Negotiate equity aggressively: "Scale's $2B secondary market means this equity is as liquid as public RSUs. I should be compensated at public-company equity levels, not startup-discount levels."

**Global Levers**
1. **Equity Liquidity Parity:** "Scale's $2B secondary market makes your equity functionally equivalent to public RSUs. I'm benchmarking my equity package against Google L3-L4 RSU grants, not startup option packages. My competing offer from [Google/Meta] includes $180K in annual RSU vesting — Scale's equity grant should match or exceed this given the pre-IPO upside."
2. **AI Infrastructure Scarcity:** "Engineers who can build data infrastructure at this scale — powering RLHF pipelines and evaluation systems for frontier AI — are among the scarcest talent in the market. My experience with [distributed systems/data pipelines/ML infrastructure] directly maps to Scale's core platform needs."
3. **Government Revenue Stability:** "Scale's DoD and NSCAI contracts provide recurring, high-margin revenue that de-risks the company far beyond a typical Series E startup. This revenue stability should be reflected in my base salary — I'm not taking a 'startup discount' when Scale has government-grade revenue predictability."
4. **Pre-IPO Upside Capture:** "At $14B valuation with a clear path to IPO, every equity dollar I negotiate today could multiply 2-4x. I want to maximize my equity allocation now while the pre-IPO discount still exists, especially since I can access liquidity through the secondary market in the interim."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm very excited about Scale's mission and the opportunity to build data infrastructure that powers frontier AI. I'm currently evaluating offers from [Google/Meta/Anthropic] with total compensation in the $260K-$280K range. Given Scale's $2B secondary market making equity functionally liquid, I'd like to see my equity grant increased from $200K/4yr to $250K/4yr, and my base moved to $195K to match the L4 benchmark. At those numbers, I'm ready to sign. My accept-at floor is $190K base with $230K/4yr equity — below that, the public company offers become too compelling to leave on the table."
