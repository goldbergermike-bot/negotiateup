**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Scale AI lead the teams building the data infrastructure that the entire AI industry depends on — from data labeling platforms processing billions of annotations to RLHF pipelines training frontier models to the Donovan platform serving US defense and intelligence agencies. At $14B+ valuation, Scale's EM role carries unique scope: you are managing teams that simultaneously serve commercial AI labs (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic) and government/defense customers with vastly different requirements, timelines, and security postures. Scale's dual customer base means EMs must balance rapid commercial iteration with government-grade reliability, making this role significantly more complex than a typical EM position at a single-market company.

**$2B Secondary Market — Private Equity as Good as Cash**
Scale AI has a $2B+ secondary market for employee shares — meaning your pre-IPO equity is functionally liquid. You don't need to wait for an IPO to realize value from your equity grants. Scale's secondary market means you can sell shares on established secondary platforms at current valuation ($14B+), providing liquidity that most pre-IPO companies cannot offer. When comparing Scale's equity to public company RSUs, factor in that Scale's shares are tradeable on secondary markets at predictable valuations. This transforms the typical 'pre-IPO equity gamble' into near-cash compensation. Negotiate equity aggressively: "Scale's $2B secondary market means this equity is as liquid as public RSUs. I should be compensated at public-company equity levels, not startup-discount levels."

**Global Levers**
1. **Dual-Customer Complexity Premium:** "Managing engineering teams that serve both commercial AI labs and government/defense customers is fundamentally more complex than single-market management. My teams need to maintain two different development cadences, security postures, and stakeholder relationships simultaneously. This dual-customer complexity should be reflected in both base salary and equity — I'm benchmarking against Google L5 EM compensation of $380K-$420K TC."
2. **Equity Leadership Multiplier:** "As an EM, my decisions about team structure, technical direction, and hiring directly impact Scale's ability to execute on its $14B+ valuation trajectory. I want my equity grant to reflect this organizational leverage — $475K-$515K/4yr, aligned with the top of the range. My impact multiplies through every engineer on my team."
3. **Talent Market Leverage:** "Engineering managers who understand AI data infrastructure and can recruit top talent in this market are exceptionally scarce. I bring a network of [X] senior engineers and a track record of building [specific team types]. Scale's ability to hire the next 10 engineers on my team depends on having an EM who can close top candidates — that's a multiplier worth investing in."
4. **Government Clearance Premium:** "My existing [TS/SCI/Secret] clearance and experience managing cleared engineering teams is directly relevant to Scale's Donovan platform and DoD contracts. Cleared EMs command a 10-15% premium in the market, and the 12-18 month timeline to obtain clearance makes this capability immediately valuable to Scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about leading an engineering team at Scale and building data infrastructure that serves both the world's leading AI labs and national security. I'm evaluating a Google L5 EM offer at $400K TC with guaranteed RSU liquidity, and I want to make Scale work. My target is $255K base with $475K/4yr equity, putting my TC at $374K — which reflects both the dual-customer complexity premium and the pre-IPO upside. I'd also like to discuss a signing bonus of $40K-$60K to offset the first-year equity cliff. My accept-at floor is $240K base with $420K/4yr equity. Below that, the risk-adjusted Google EM offer becomes the more rational choice."
