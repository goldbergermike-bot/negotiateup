### Data Scientist | Scale AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | AI Data Infrastructure Leader | $2B Secondary Market Liquidity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $178K-$222K | $175K-$308K | — | $222K-$299K |
| New York | $183K-$233K | $175K-$308K | — | $227K-$310K |
| Washington DC | $187K-$240K | $175K-$308K | — | $231K-$317K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Scale AI work at the meta-level of AI data — you are the data scientist analyzing the data that trains other AI systems. Your work spans data quality analytics that determine labeling accuracy across billions of annotations, model evaluation metrics that measure whether frontier AI systems are safe and performant, and labeling accuracy analysis that directly impacts every customer from OpenAI to the US Department of Defense. At $14B+ valuation, Scale's data science team provides the analytical foundation for the company's core value proposition: that Scale's data is measurably better than alternatives. Your statistical rigor and analytical insights are the evidence that supports Scale's premium pricing and customer retention across both commercial and government contracts.

**$2B Secondary Market — Private Equity as Good as Cash**
Scale AI has a $2B+ secondary market for employee shares — meaning your pre-IPO equity is functionally liquid. You don't need to wait for an IPO to realize value from your equity grants. Scale's secondary market means you can sell shares on established secondary platforms at current valuation ($14B+), providing liquidity that most pre-IPO companies cannot offer. When comparing Scale's equity to public company RSUs, factor in that Scale's shares are tradeable on secondary markets at predictable valuations. This transforms the typical 'pre-IPO equity gamble' into near-cash compensation. Negotiate equity aggressively: "Scale's $2B secondary market means this equity is as liquid as public RSUs. I should be compensated at public-company equity levels, not startup-discount levels."

**Global Levers**
1. **Data Quality Revenue Impact:** "My analytical work directly determines whether Scale can prove its data quality premium to customers. The difference between 'we think our labels are better' and 'we can statistically prove our labels are 3% more accurate with p<0.001' is the difference between losing and winning a $50M AI lab contract. My expertise in [statistical analysis/data quality metrics/experimental design] has a direct and measurable revenue impact."
2. **Model Evaluation Analytics Scarcity:** "Data scientists who understand both classical statistics and modern AI evaluation metrics — including RLHF alignment scoring, model safety benchmarking, and multi-dimensional quality assessment — are extremely scarce. My background in [ML evaluation/NLP metrics/alignment measurement] maps directly to Scale's expansion into the GenAI evaluation platform."
3. **Government Analytics Premium:** "Analytical work for government and defense contracts requires understanding of classified data handling, formal verification methods, and reporting standards that commercial data science roles don't require. My experience with [government analytics/defense data science/cleared analytical work] directly supports Scale's Donovan platform metrics and DoD contract deliverables."
4. **Cross-Customer Insights Leverage:** "I can build analytical frameworks that serve both commercial AI labs and government customers — measuring labeling quality, annotator performance, and model evaluation metrics in ways that scale across all of Scale's customer segments. This cross-customer analytical capability multiplies my impact versus a single-product data scientist."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the unique meta-level data science challenges at Scale — analyzing the data quality that determines AI model performance globally. I'm evaluating offers from [Google/Meta/Databricks] in the $280K-$300K TC range. My target for Scale is $215K base with $290K/4yr equity, putting my TC at $288K. My specific expertise in [data quality analytics/model evaluation metrics/labeling accuracy measurement] directly maps to Scale's core differentiation. My accept-at floor is $200K base with $255K/4yr equity. Below that threshold, the guaranteed compensation at my public company alternatives becomes too significant to forgo."
