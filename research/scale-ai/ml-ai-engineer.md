| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $205K-$258K | $285K-$498K | — | $276K-$383K |
| New York | $211K-$271K | $285K-$498K | — | $282K-$395K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Scale AI build the machine learning systems that evaluate, improve, and assure the quality of the data powering the world's most advanced AI models. You are engineering the model evaluation frameworks used to assess frontier AI systems for safety, accuracy, and alignment; the RLHF systems that generate the human feedback data critical to AI alignment; and the ML-powered data quality systems that ensure Scale's labeling output meets the exacting standards of customers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and the US Department of Defense. At $14B+ valuation, Scale's ML engineers operate at the meta-level of AI — building AI systems that evaluate and improve other AI systems. The +20-35% Agentic AI Premium reflects the extreme market scarcity of engineers who can build autonomous evaluation and data quality systems that operate at Scale's volume.

**Level Mapping:** Scale ML/AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta ML Engineer (IC4-IC5) = Amazon Applied Scientist II-III = Apple ML Engineer = OpenAI Research Engineer

**$2B Secondary Market — Private Equity as Good as Cash**
Scale AI has a $2B+ secondary market for employee shares — meaning your pre-IPO equity is functionally liquid. You don't need to wait for an IPO to realize value from your equity grants. Scale's secondary market means you can sell shares on established secondary platforms at current valuation ($14B+), providing liquidity that most pre-IPO companies cannot offer. When comparing Scale's equity to public company RSUs, factor in that Scale's shares are tradeable on secondary markets at predictable valuations. This transforms the typical 'pre-IPO equity gamble' into near-cash compensation. Negotiate equity aggressively: "Scale's $2B secondary market means this equity is as liquid as public RSUs. I should be compensated at public-company equity levels, not startup-discount levels."

**Global Levers**
1. **Agentic AI Premium Activation:** "The market for ML engineers who can build autonomous evaluation systems, agentic data quality pipelines, and self-improving RLHF frameworks is commanding a 20-35% premium over standard ML engineering compensation. My specific experience with [agentic systems/autonomous evaluation/self-improving ML pipelines] places me in the agentic AI talent tier. I'm benchmarking against OpenAI and Anthropic offers that reflect this premium — my equity target of $460K-$498K/4yr reflects the agentic AI market rate."
2. **Model Evaluation Systems Expertise:** "Building ML systems that evaluate other ML models — measuring safety, accuracy, alignment, and capability across dozens of dimensions — is a discipline that barely existed three years ago. My experience with [model evaluation/LLM benchmarking/safety assessment/red-teaming ML systems] directly maps to Scale's GenAI Platform evaluation roadmap. Engineers with genuine model evaluation ML expertise are the scarcest hire in AI right now."
3. **RLHF Systems Architecture:** "Scale's RLHF data products are among its highest-value offerings — the human feedback data that trains reward models and aligns frontier AI systems. ML engineers who can build the systems that collect, aggregate, quality-check, and deliver RLHF data at scale are building the infrastructure that determines whether AI alignment succeeds. My experience with [RLHF pipelines/reward modeling/preference learning systems] is directly tied to Scale's most strategic product line."
4. **Data Quality ML Innovation:** "I can build ML-powered data quality systems that automatically detect labeling errors, annotator biases, and data distribution issues across billions of annotations. These systems compound in value — every quality improvement I build multiplies across Scale's entire data output, improving every customer's AI training data simultaneously. My track record of [specific quality improvement metrics] demonstrates measurable impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply excited about building the ML systems that evaluate and improve the world's AI at Scale. I'm currently evaluating offers from [OpenAI/Anthropic/DeepMind] in the $370K-$400K TC range, reflecting the agentic AI premium. My target for Scale is $248K base with $475K/4yr equity, putting my TC at $367K. Given Scale's $2B secondary market, I'm treating this equity as functionally liquid and benchmarking against public company RSU grants. My specific expertise in [model evaluation ML/RLHF systems/autonomous data quality] directly accelerates Scale's highest-priority ML initiatives. My accept-at floor is $235K base with $420K/4yr equity. Below that, the AI lab offers with their own pre-IPO equity and higher base salaries become the dominant option."
