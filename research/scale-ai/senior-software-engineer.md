### Senior Software Engineer | Scale AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | AI Data Infrastructure Leader | $2B Secondary Market Liquidity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $195K-$242K | $240K-$415K | — | $255K-$346K |
| New York | $201K-$254K | $240K-$415K | — | $261K-$358K |
| Washington DC | $205K-$261K | $240K-$415K | — | $265K-$366K |

**Negotiation DNA**
As a Senior Software Engineer at Scale AI, you are a technical leader building the core data infrastructure that the world's most important AI systems depend on — from OpenAI's training pipelines to the US military's Donovan AI platform. Scale's $14B+ valuation reflects its position as the essential middleware layer between raw data and frontier AI models, and senior engineers here own critical systems spanning data labeling platforms, RLHF pipelines, model evaluation frameworks, and the GenAI Platform. Your dual-customer architecture — commercial AI labs generating rapid growth and government/defense contracts providing stable recurring revenue — creates a compensation environment where Scale can offer both aggressive pre-IPO equity and competitive base salaries.

**$2B Secondary Market — Private Equity as Good as Cash**
Scale AI has a $2B+ secondary market for employee shares — meaning your pre-IPO equity is functionally liquid. You don't need to wait for an IPO to realize value from your equity grants. Scale's secondary market means you can sell shares on established secondary platforms at current valuation ($14B+), providing liquidity that most pre-IPO companies cannot offer. When comparing Scale's equity to public company RSUs, factor in that Scale's shares are tradeable on secondary markets at predictable valuations. This transforms the typical 'pre-IPO equity gamble' into near-cash compensation. Negotiate equity aggressively: "Scale's $2B secondary market means this equity is as liquid as public RSUs. I should be compensated at public-company equity levels, not startup-discount levels."

**Global Levers**
1. **Equity Liquidity Parity at Senior Level:** "At the senior level, equity becomes the dominant compensation lever. Google L4 RSU grants range $280K-$400K/4yr with guaranteed liquidity. Scale's $2B secondary market means I should benchmark against those numbers directly — my target is $380K/4yr in equity, reflecting both public-company parity and pre-IPO upside premium."
2. **System Ownership Leverage:** "Senior engineers at Scale own entire subsystems — data labeling orchestration, evaluation pipelines, RLHF data flow. I bring [specific system ownership experience] that maps directly to Scale's platform architecture. The ramp-up cost of losing a senior engineer who owns a critical system is 6-12 months of productivity."
3. **AI Lab Competing Offer Framing:** "I have a competing offer from [Anthropic/OpenAI/DeepMind] at $340K+ TC. These AI-native companies are Scale's direct talent competitors. While I prefer Scale's infrastructure mission, the compensation gap needs to be within 10% for me to choose pre-IPO equity over guaranteed public-company RSUs."
4. **Government Platform Premium:** "My experience with [security-sensitive systems/high-reliability infrastructure/FedRAMP environments] is directly relevant to Scale's Donovan platform and DoD contracts. Engineers who can work across both commercial and government codebases command a premium — Scale's government revenue depends on retaining engineers with this dual capability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply aligned with Scale's mission of building the data infrastructure layer for AI. My current competing offers put me at $330K-$350K total compensation at [Google L4/Meta E4/Anthropic]. Given that Scale's secondary market makes equity functionally liquid, I'd like to see my package structured as $230K base with $380K/4yr equity — that puts my TC at $325K, which is within striking distance of my public company offers while giving me meaningful pre-IPO upside. My accept-at floor is $220K base with $340K/4yr equity. Below that threshold, the risk-adjusted value of my Google L4 offer becomes dominant."
