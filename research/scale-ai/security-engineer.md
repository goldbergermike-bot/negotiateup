### Security Engineer | Scale AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | AI Data Infrastructure Leader | $2B Secondary Market Liquidity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $188K-$235K | $195K-$342K | — | $237K-$321K |
| New York | $194K-$247K | $195K-$342K | — | $243K-$332K |
| Washington DC | $197K-$254K | $195K-$342K | — | $246K-$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Scale AI protect the most sensitive data in AI — the training datasets, RLHF annotations, model evaluation results, and customer intellectual property that flow through Scale's platform from the world's leading AI labs and US government agencies. At $14B+ valuation, Scale's security challenges are uniquely high-stakes: you are securing data from OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google alongside classified information from the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies. A single security breach could compromise both commercial customer trust and national security. Scale's dual-customer model means security engineers must maintain both SOC 2/ISO 27001 commercial compliance and FedRAMP/IL4/IL5 government authorization simultaneously — a scope of security responsibility that few companies demand.

**Level Mapping:** Scale Security Engineer = Google L4-L5 Security = Meta Security Engineer (IC4-IC5) = Amazon Security Engineer II-III = Apple Security Engineer = Microsoft Security Engineer 62-64

**$2B Secondary Market — Private Equity as Good as Cash**
Scale AI has a $2B+ secondary market for employee shares — meaning your pre-IPO equity is functionally liquid. You don't need to wait for an IPO to realize value from your equity grants. Scale's secondary market means you can sell shares on established secondary platforms at current valuation ($14B+), providing liquidity that most pre-IPO companies cannot offer. When comparing Scale's equity to public company RSUs, factor in that Scale's shares are tradeable on secondary markets at predictable valuations. This transforms the typical 'pre-IPO equity gamble' into near-cash compensation. Negotiate equity aggressively: "Scale's $2B secondary market means this equity is as liquid as public RSUs. I should be compensated at public-company equity levels, not startup-discount levels."

**Global Levers**
1. **Clearance-Gated Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers with active [TS/SCI/Secret] clearances who also have experience with AI data infrastructure security are among the most scarce talent in the entire technology industry. My active clearance alone took 12-18 months and significant investment to obtain. Combined with my expertise in [AI data security/ML pipeline security/data labeling platform security], I'm in a talent pool that Scale cannot easily access. This scarcity should be reflected in a 15-20% premium over uncleared security engineering roles."
2. **AI Training Data Security Specialization:** "Securing AI training datasets is fundamentally different from traditional application security. Data poisoning attacks, model extraction through API abuse, annotation pipeline integrity, and RLHF data tampering are emerging attack vectors that most security engineers haven't encountered. My experience with [AI/ML security/data integrity/adversarial ML defense] directly addresses Scale's most critical and novel security challenges."
3. **FedRAMP Authorization Revenue Enabler:** "Scale's government contracts — worth tens of millions in recurring revenue — depend entirely on maintaining FedRAMP authorization and government security compliance. My experience with [FedRAMP authorization/DISA STIG compliance/IL4-IL5 environments/ATO processes] directly enables and protects this revenue stream. Losing FedRAMP authorization would eliminate Scale's entire government business."
4. **Dual-Compliance Architecture:** "Maintaining simultaneous compliance across commercial standards (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, GDPR) and government standards (FedRAMP High, NIST 800-171, ITAR) requires a security architecture that most companies never need to build. My ability to design security frameworks that satisfy both compliance universes simultaneously is directly tied to Scale's ability to serve its dual customer base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the security challenges at Scale — protecting the most sensitive data in AI across both commercial AI labs and government agencies. I'm evaluating offers from [Google Security/CrowdStrike/Palo Alto Networks] in the $310K-$330K TC range. With my active [TS/SCI] clearance and AI security expertise, my target for Scale is $228K base with $320K/4yr equity, putting my TC at $308K. The clearance premium alone justifies a 15% increase over Scale's uncleared security engineering band. My accept-at floor is $215K base with $280K/4yr equity. Below that, the cleared security market offers too many alternatives at higher guaranteed compensation."
