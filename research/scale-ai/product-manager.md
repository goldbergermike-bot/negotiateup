**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Scale AI define the roadmap for the data infrastructure platform that powers frontier AI development worldwide. You are shaping products across three critical domains: the core data labeling and annotation platform serving AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic, the Donovan government AI platform serving DoD and intelligence agencies, and the GenAI Platform providing model evaluation and RLHF tools. At $14B+ valuation, Scale PMs sit at the intersection of commercial AI growth and government contract stability — a unique product leadership position where your decisions directly impact how the world's most consequential AI systems are trained, evaluated, and deployed.

**Level Mapping:** Scale PM = Google L5 PM = Meta PM (IC5) = Amazon Sr. PM = Apple PM = Microsoft Sr. PM 62-63

**$2B Secondary Market — Private Equity as Good as Cash**
Scale AI has a $2B+ secondary market for employee shares — meaning your pre-IPO equity is functionally liquid. You don't need to wait for an IPO to realize value from your equity grants. Scale's secondary market means you can sell shares on established secondary platforms at current valuation ($14B+), providing liquidity that most pre-IPO companies cannot offer. When comparing Scale's equity to public company RSUs, factor in that Scale's shares are tradeable on secondary markets at predictable valuations. This transforms the typical 'pre-IPO equity gamble' into near-cash compensation. Negotiate equity aggressively: "Scale's $2B secondary market means this equity is as liquid as public RSUs. I should be compensated at public-company equity levels, not startup-discount levels."

**Global Levers**
1. **Platform Strategy Ownership:** "Product Managers at Scale don't just manage features — they define the data infrastructure strategy for an entire AI ecosystem. My product decisions directly impact revenue from AI lab contracts worth tens of millions annually and government contracts with multi-year commitments. This strategic ownership should be reflected in my equity grant: $330K-$355K/4yr, aligned with the scope of impact."
2. **Donovan / Government Product Premium:** "PMs who can navigate both commercial product velocity and government procurement cycles are exceptionally rare. My experience with [FedRAMP/DoD acquisition/government product management] directly maps to Scale's Donovan platform roadmap. Government product PMs command a 10-15% premium because the domain expertise takes years to develop."
3. **AI Evaluation Domain Expertise:** "Scale is expanding from data labeling into full AI evaluation and RLHF tooling. My background in [model evaluation/ML product management/data quality systems] positions me to lead the GenAI Platform product strategy — the highest-growth segment of Scale's business. PMs with genuine AI evaluation expertise are the bottleneck for this expansion."
4. **Customer Relationship Leverage:** "I bring existing relationships with [specific AI labs/enterprise customers/government agencies] that directly accelerate Scale's sales pipeline. A PM who can close product-led deals with existing customer relationships is worth significantly more than one who needs 6-12 months to build those connections."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply excited about shaping Scale's product strategy across the data labeling platform, Donovan, and GenAI evaluation tools. I'm currently evaluating offers from [Google/Anthropic/Databricks] in the $310K-$330K TC range. My target for Scale is $220K base with $330K/4yr equity, putting my TC at $303K — competitive with my alternatives while reflecting Scale's pre-IPO upside. Given my domain expertise in [AI evaluation/government platforms/data infrastructure], I believe this is well-justified. My accept-at floor is $210K base with $290K/4yr equity. I'd also like to discuss a signing bonus to bridge the first-year equity cliff."
