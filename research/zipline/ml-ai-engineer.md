**Level Mapping:** Zipline ML/AI (IC2-IC4) = Wing ML Engineer = Amazon Prime Air ML Engineer = Google L3-L5 ML

**Drone AI — The Autonomous Flight Premium**

As an ML/AI Engineer at Zipline, you build models enabling autonomous drone flight and precision delivery. "As an ML/AI Engineer, I build the machine learning models enabling Zipline's autonomous drone flight — navigation, obstacle avoidance, and precision landing. I want equity reflecting the safety-critical nature of drone AI."

**Global Levers**

1. **Safety-Critical Drone AI:** "I build ML models for autonomous drone flight — where model accuracy affects aviation safety. Navigation, obstacle avoidance, and precision landing models must meet aviation-grade reliability."
2. **$4.2B Valuation — Core AI Capability:** "ML/AI engineers build Zipline's core autonomous flight capability. Without drone AI, there is no autonomous delivery."
3. **Precision Delivery ML:** "I build models enabling Zipline's P2 Zip to deliver packages with precision to homes — requiring advanced computer vision and control algorithms."
4. **Drone AI Competition:** "Wing, Amazon Prime Air, and other drone companies compete for ML engineers with autonomous flight experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and $220K equity over 4 years with 15% bonus for this ML/AI Engineer role. I build the machine learning models enabling Zipline's autonomous drone flight and precision delivery — safety-critical AI for aviation operations. I have competing offers from [Wing at $338K TC / Amazon Prime Air at $348K TC]. ML engineers building autonomous flight AI are scarce." Accept at $185K+ base and $172K+ equity.
