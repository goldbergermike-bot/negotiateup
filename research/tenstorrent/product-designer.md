### Product Designer | Tenstorrent Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** [Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Sovereign AI Bonus] | RISC-V AI Silicon | Blackhole/Wormhole Architecture | Jim Keller Leadership | Developer Experience Focus

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$108K–C$142K | C$35K–C$55K | 8–12% | C$168K–C$232K |
| Austin | $105K–$140K | $30K–$48K | 8–12% | $155K–$215K |
| Remote US | $98K–$135K | $28K–$45K | 8–12% | $148K–$205K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Tenstorrent shape the developer experience for RISC-V AI silicon — designing the interfaces, documentation systems, SDK dashboards, and developer tools that determine whether engineers worldwide adopt Blackhole and Wormhole chips over NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem. Under Jim Keller's leadership, design is not cosmetic — it is a strategic weapon in the battle for developer mindshare. At a late-stage startup valued at ~$3.5B, designers have direct access to engineering leadership and can influence product direction in ways that would take years at larger semiconductor companies.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

Product Designers at Tenstorrent play a critical role in the Sovereign AI ecosystem: if the developer experience for RISC-V AI silicon is poor, no amount of chip performance will convince nations to adopt Tenstorrent over NVIDIA. Dozens of countries pursuing AI independence need tools, dashboards, and documentation that their domestic AI teams can use effectively — often with less specialized talent than Silicon Valley companies employ. Designers must create intuitive onboarding flows, performance monitoring dashboards, and SDK interfaces that lower the barrier to Sovereign AI deployment. Jim Keller's track record (AMD Zen, Apple A-series, Tesla FSD) draws elite engineers, but the developer experience layer is what converts engineering excellence into market adoption. The Blackhole and Wormhole chip families need world-class design to compete. Candidates should negotiate for Sovereign AI UX bonuses of $8K–$14K annually, tied to developer adoption metrics and international deployment usability milestones.

**Global Levers**

1. **Developer Experience Equity Impact:** "The developer experience I design will directly determine Tenstorrent's ability to compete with NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem for developer mindshare. I'm requesting a 20% equity uplift reflecting the strategic impact of design on platform adoption."
2. **Sovereign AI UX Bonus:** "I'll be designing the tools and interfaces that Sovereign AI programs in dozens of countries use daily. I'm requesting a $10K–$14K annual Sovereign AI UX bonus tied to developer adoption and usability metrics."
3. **Design Scarcity in Semiconductor:** "Product designers with deep developer tools and semiconductor ecosystem experience are extremely rare — most design talent flows to consumer tech. My background in [developer tools design/technical product design] commands a scarcity premium: $135K+ base."
4. **Signing Bonus for Portfolio Impact:** "I'll be redesigning the Tenstorrent developer portal and SDK onboarding within my first 90 days. A $10K–$15K signing bonus reflects the immediate impact expected and offsets my transition from [current company]."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the chance to shape developer experience for RISC-V AI silicon at Tenstorrent. I have a design offer from [Figma/Vercel/Datadog] at $195K total comp. Given Tenstorrent's pre-IPO equity at ~$3.5B and the Sovereign AI developer experience opportunity, I'm targeting $198K–$205K total comp: $135K base, $45K equity, and a $12K Sovereign AI UX bonus. My accept-at floor is $182K total comp — below that, the risk premium doesn't clear my alternative. I can sign this week at $190K+ and contribute immediately to the Blackhole developer experience launch."
