### Software Engineer | Tenstorrent Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** [Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Sovereign AI Bonus] | RISC-V AI Silicon | Blackhole/Wormhole Architecture | Jim Keller Leadership | Late-Stage Startup ~$3.5B Valuation

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$115K–C$148K | C$40K–C$65K | 8–12% | C$175K–C$242K |
| Austin | $118K–$155K | $30K–$50K | 8–12% | $162K–$225K |
| Remote US | $110K–$148K | $28K–$48K | 8–12% | $155K–$215K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Tenstorrent Software Engineers work at the intersection of open-source RISC-V architecture and next-generation AI silicon, building the compiler toolchains, firmware, and runtime systems that power the Blackhole and Wormhole chip families. Under Jim Keller's technical leadership — the architect behind AMD Zen, Apple A-series, and Tesla's FSD chip — even entry-level engineers gain exposure to silicon-software co-design that is unavailable at any other company. As the only viable open-architecture alternative to NVIDIA's proprietary CUDA ecosystem, Tenstorrent's software stack is a critical enabler for nations pursuing Sovereign AI independence.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

Tenstorrent's RISC-V-based AI processors represent the only credible open-architecture alternative to NVIDIA's dominant CUDA ecosystem. Dozens of nations — from Canada and the EU to Japan, India, and the Gulf states — are actively pursuing Sovereign AI strategies that require domestically controllable, non-proprietary chip architectures. As a Software Engineer at Tenstorrent, your work on compiler infrastructure, driver stacks, and performance optimization directly enables these countries to build AI capability independent of US/NVIDIA supply chains. Jim Keller's track record of shipping transformative silicon (AMD Zen, Apple A-series, Tesla FSD) has attracted elite talent and positioned Tenstorrent for exponential growth as Sovereign AI demand accelerates through 2026–2028. Candidates should negotiate for explicit Sovereign AI project bonuses of $8K–$15K, framing their contributions as enabling national AI independence. The Blackhole and Wormhole chip launches represent inflection points — engineers joining now receive pre-IPO equity at a ~$3.5B valuation with significant upside as government contracts scale.

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Acceleration:** "Given Tenstorrent's ~$3.5B valuation and the Blackhole chip ramp, I'd like to discuss an enhanced equity grant that reflects the pre-IPO upside — specifically an additional 15–20% in options vesting over four years."
2. **Sovereign AI Bonus:** "My work will directly support Sovereign AI deployments for international partners. I'd like to include a $10K–$15K annual Sovereign AI project bonus tied to government and international program milestones."
3. **Jim Keller Talent Premium:** "Tenstorrent attracts elite silicon talent because of Jim Keller's leadership. To remain competitive with offers from AMD, Apple, and NVIDIA, I'm looking for a base salary at the 75th percentile of your posted range."
4. **RISC-V Ecosystem Scarcity:** "Engineers with RISC-V compiler and toolchain experience are exceptionally scarce. My background in [specific RISC-V/embedded systems skill] positions me to contribute immediately to the Wormhole software stack, which justifies a signing bonus of $12K–$18K."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm very excited about Tenstorrent's mission under Jim Keller and the Blackhole/Wormhole roadmap. I currently hold a competing offer at $180K total comp from [AMD/Qualcomm/Intel]. Given Tenstorrent's pre-IPO equity upside and the unique Sovereign AI opportunity, I'd like to target $205K–$215K in total comp, broken down as $148K base, $50K equity, and a $12K Sovereign AI bonus. My accept-at floor is $192K total comp — below that, the risk-adjusted value doesn't clear my competing offer. I believe the equity upside at a ~$3.5B valuation makes this a win-win, and I'm ready to sign this week if we can align on these numbers."
