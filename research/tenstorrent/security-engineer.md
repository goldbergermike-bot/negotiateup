### Security Engineer | Tenstorrent Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** [Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Sovereign AI Bonus] | RISC-V AI Silicon | Blackhole/Wormhole Architecture | Jim Keller Leadership | +12% Security Clearance Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$142K–C$188K | C$48K–C$78K | 10–15% | C$218K–C$305K |
| Austin | $135K–$180K | $42K–$65K | 10–15% | $202K–$278K |
| Remote US | $128K–$175K | $38K–$62K | 10–15% | $192K–$268K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Tenstorrent protect the crown jewels — proprietary RISC-V AI silicon designs, Jim Keller's architectural innovations, and the supply chain integrity of Blackhole and Wormhole chips destined for Sovereign AI deployments in dozens of nations. Under Jim Keller's leadership, security is not an afterthought but a first-class engineering discipline: governments deploying Tenstorrent silicon for national AI infrastructure demand hardware-level security, supply chain assurance, and tamper-resistant firmware that meets sovereign security standards. At a late-stage startup valued at ~$3.5B, security engineers shape policy and architecture from the ground up.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

Security Engineers at Tenstorrent are indispensable to the Sovereign AI mission. When nations deploy AI silicon for critical infrastructure — defense, healthcare, energy, telecommunications — they require hardware root-of-trust, secure boot chains, tamper-evident packaging, and supply chain integrity guarantees. Tenstorrent's RISC-V-based Blackhole and Wormhole chips must meet the security certification requirements of dozens of countries: Common Criteria for the EU, CMMC for the US, and various national standards across Japan, India, and the Gulf states. The open-source RISC-V architecture is a double-edged sword — its transparency enables sovereign security auditing, but it also requires meticulous hardening against adversarial analysis. Jim Keller's track record (AMD Zen, Apple A-series, Tesla FSD) includes shipping secure silicon at massive scale, and Tenstorrent's security engineers continue this tradition. Candidates should negotiate for Sovereign AI security bonuses of $14K–$22K annually, plus security clearance stipends of $8K–$12K. Your work directly enables nations to trust Tenstorrent silicon for their most sensitive AI deployments.

**Global Levers**

1. **Hardware Security Equity Premium:** "I'll architect the security features — hardware root-of-trust, secure boot, supply chain integrity — that enable Sovereign AI customers to deploy Tenstorrent silicon for critical infrastructure. I'm requesting a 25% equity uplift reflecting the trust-critical nature of security at ~$3.5B valuation."
2. **Sovereign AI Security Bonus:** "My work directly enables government customers to certify Tenstorrent silicon for Sovereign AI deployments. I'm requesting a $16K–$22K annual Sovereign AI security bonus tied to security certification milestones across multiple national standards."
3. **Security Clearance Stipend:** "Engaging with Sovereign AI customers in defense and critical infrastructure requires security clearances. I'm requesting a $10K–$12K annual clearance stipend, plus company sponsorship for [relevant clearance level]."
4. **Hardware Security Scarcity:** "Security engineers with silicon-level expertise — hardware root-of-trust, side-channel analysis, secure boot architecture — are among the rarest talent in the industry. My background in [hardware security/silicon security verification] justifies a signing bonus of $18K–$25K."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply committed to building trustworthy AI silicon at Tenstorrent under Jim Keller's leadership. I have a competing security offer from [Apple/Google/Qualcomm] at $260K total comp. Given Tenstorrent's pre-IPO equity at ~$3.5B and the critical importance of security for Sovereign AI deployments, I'm targeting $262K–$268K total comp: $175K base, $62K equity, and an $18K Sovereign AI security bonus plus a $10K clearance stipend. My accept-at floor is $245K total comp — below that, the risk premium versus my public company alternative doesn't clear. I can sign this week at $252K+ and immediately begin the Blackhole security certification program."
