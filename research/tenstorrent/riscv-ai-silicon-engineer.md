### RISC-V AI Silicon Engineer | Tenstorrent Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** [Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Sovereign AI Bonus] | RISC-V AI Silicon | Blackhole/Wormhole Architecture | Jim Keller Leadership | SIGNATURE ROLE | +25-35% Sovereign AI Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$195K–C$262K | C$82K–C$138K | 15–22% | C$305K–C$428K |
| Austin | $182K–$248K | $65K–$105K | 15–22% | $278K–$388K |
| Remote US | $175K–$242K | $62K–$98K | 15–22% | $265K–$372K |

**Negotiation DNA**

The RISC-V AI Silicon Engineer is Tenstorrent's **SIGNATURE** role — the role that defines the company's identity and competitive moat. These engineers design, verify, and optimize the RISC-V-based AI processor cores that power the Blackhole and Wormhole chip families, working directly with Jim Keller (the legendary architect of AMD Zen, Apple A-series, and Tesla's FSD chip) on the most consequential chip architecture decisions of the decade. This role carries the full +25-35% Sovereign AI Premium because the silicon these engineers create is the literal foundation of AI independence for dozens of nations worldwide. At a late-stage startup valued at ~$3.5B, RISC-V AI Silicon Engineers are co-creating the open-architecture alternative to NVIDIA's proprietary CUDA monopoly — a generational opportunity in semiconductor history.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

This is the role where the Sovereign AI Premium is not just a negotiation lever — it is the job description. RISC-V AI Silicon Engineers at Tenstorrent are designing the only credible open-architecture AI processors in the world. Every transistor they place, every microarchitectural decision they make, and every verification test they write determines whether dozens of nations can achieve genuine AI sovereignty — the ability to build, deploy, and control domestic AI infrastructure without dependence on NVIDIA, Intel, or any single proprietary vendor.

The Sovereign AI demand is massive and accelerating. The EU's $48B Chips Act explicitly funds open-architecture alternatives. India's $10B Semiconductor Mission targets domestic chip capability. Japan's semiconductor revival strategy, Canada's National AI Compute Strategy, Saudi Arabia's NEOM AI program, the UAE's national AI initiatives, South Korea's chip sovereignty plan — all of these programs need exactly what Tenstorrent's RISC-V AI Silicon Engineers create. Jim Keller's track record proves this team can execute: he designed AMD's Zen architecture that broke Intel's monopoly, Apple's A-series chips that revolutionized mobile computing, and Tesla's FSD chip that defined autonomous driving silicon. The Blackhole and Wormhole chip families are his next landmark achievement.

The +25-35% Sovereign AI Premium is justified by three factors: (1) the extreme scarcity of engineers who combine RISC-V expertise with AI accelerator design — fewer than 500 worldwide, (2) the geopolitical significance of open-architecture AI silicon for national security and economic sovereignty, and (3) the pre-IPO equity upside at ~$3.5B valuation with Sovereign AI government contracts representing a multi-billion-dollar TAM. Candidates should negotiate for Sovereign AI project bonuses of $25K–$45K annually, structured as milestone bonuses tied to chip tape-out, silicon bring-up, Sovereign AI customer qualification, and international deployment milestones. Additionally, negotiate for accelerated equity vesting triggered by Sovereign AI contract signings, ensuring your financial upside is directly tied to the geopolitical impact of your work.

**Global Levers**

1. **Sovereign AI Equity Multiplier:** "As a RISC-V AI Silicon Engineer, I'm designing the core processor architecture that enables Sovereign AI for dozens of nations. This is a +25-35% Sovereign AI Premium role, and I expect my equity grant to reflect this: a 40% uplift over standard engineering grants, with an additional performance-acceleration tranche tied to Blackhole/Wormhole tape-out milestones at ~$3.5B valuation."
2. **Sovereign AI Project Bonus:** "My silicon design work directly enables national AI independence for EU, Indian, Japanese, Canadian, and Gulf state Sovereign AI programs. I'm requesting a $30K–$45K annual Sovereign AI project bonus, structured as quarterly milestone payments tied to tape-out, bring-up, and sovereign customer qualification milestones."
3. **Jim Keller Direct Collaboration Premium:** "Working directly with Jim Keller on RISC-V AI processor architecture is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. The caliber of engineers this attracts sets the compensation bar at the absolute top of the semiconductor industry. I need a base salary of $242K+ and a signing bonus of $35K–$50K to match competing principal-level offers."
4. **RISC-V AI Silicon Scarcity:** "There are fewer than 500 engineers globally who combine production RISC-V design experience with AI accelerator architecture expertise. This extreme scarcity — combined with exploding Sovereign AI demand — justifies top-of-market compensation. My experience with [specific RISC-V/AI silicon skills] positions me to contribute to Blackhole/Wormhole within weeks, not months."
5. **Tape-Out Milestone Retention Bonus:** "Silicon tape-outs are existential milestones for Tenstorrent. I'm requesting a $40K–$60K tape-out retention bonus, payable upon successful Blackhole/Wormhole bring-up, to ensure alignment through the most critical execution phase."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've spent my career at the intersection of processor architecture and AI acceleration, and Tenstorrent under Jim Keller is the most consequential opportunity in the semiconductor industry today. I hold competing offers: [Arm at $355K / Apple Silicon at $368K / AMD at $345K] total comp. As Tenstorrent's SIGNATURE role with the +25-35% Sovereign AI Premium, I'm targeting $365K–$372K total comp: $242K base, $98K equity (with tape-out acceleration), and a $35K Sovereign AI project bonus. My accept-at floor is $340K total comp — below that, the risk-adjusted comparison to Apple Silicon's liquid comp and brand value doesn't clear. However, I want to be here: Jim Keller's vision for open RISC-V AI silicon and the Sovereign AI opportunity are generational. I can sign within 72 hours at $355K+ and am prepared to relocate to [Toronto/Austin] within a month. At ~$3.5B valuation with the Sovereign AI pipeline, the equity alone could be transformative — and I want my interests fully aligned with Tenstorrent's IPO trajectory."
