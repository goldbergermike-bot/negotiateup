**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Tenstorrent are the technical bridge between RISC-V AI silicon and the customers deploying it — from hyperscalers and AI labs to Sovereign AI programs across dozens of nations. Under Jim Keller's leadership, SAs must combine deep hardware understanding (Blackhole/Wormhole architecture, memory hierarchies, interconnect topologies) with software stack expertise (TT-Metalium runtime, compiler toolchains, AI framework integration) to design complete solutions that outperform NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem for specific workloads. At a late-stage startup valued at ~$3.5B, SAs directly influence deal outcomes and product roadmap feedback.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

Solutions Architects are on the front lines of the Sovereign AI opportunity. When a nation — whether EU, Japan, India, Canada, or a Gulf state — evaluates Tenstorrent's RISC-V AI chips for their domestic AI infrastructure, a Solutions Architect designs the reference architecture, runs proof-of-concept deployments, and demonstrates that Blackhole/Wormhole silicon can meet sovereign performance and security requirements. This is the role that converts Tenstorrent's open-architecture advantage into signed government contracts. Jim Keller's legendary track record (AMD Zen, Apple A-series, Tesla FSD) opens doors with technical decision-makers — and Solutions Architects walk through those doors to close the deal. Dozens of countries need SA engagement to validate their Sovereign AI deployments, creating sustained demand for this role. Candidates should negotiate for Sovereign AI deployment bonuses of $12K–$20K annually, plus per-deal commission structures for Sovereign AI contracts they help close.

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue-Tied Equity:** "As SA, I directly influence deal outcomes with Sovereign AI customers. I'm requesting a 25% equity uplift with an additional performance-vesting tranche tied to customer deployment milestones — aligning my upside with Tenstorrent's revenue growth at ~$3.5B valuation."
2. **Sovereign AI Deployment Bonus:** "I'll be designing and validating reference architectures for Sovereign AI programs across multiple nations. I'm requesting a $15K–$20K annual Sovereign AI deployment bonus, plus a per-deal bonus of $5K–$10K for each Sovereign AI contract I support."
3. **Customer-Facing Travel & Flexibility:** "Sovereign AI customer engagement requires international travel to government labs and data centers. I'm requesting a $12K annual travel stipend and flexibility to work from customer sites across the EU, Japan, and Gulf states."
4. **Competing NVIDIA SA Offer:** "I hold a Solutions Architect offer from NVIDIA at $248K total comp. While Tenstorrent's open-architecture mission and pre-IPO equity are compelling, I need a base of at least $165K to offset the liquidity risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply motivated by Tenstorrent's mission to bring open RISC-V AI silicon to Sovereign AI programs worldwide. I have a competing SA offer from NVIDIA at $248K total comp. Given Tenstorrent's pre-IPO equity at ~$3.5B and my direct impact on Sovereign AI deal outcomes, I'm targeting $248K–$252K total comp: $165K base, $58K equity, and an $18K Sovereign AI deployment bonus. My accept-at floor is $232K total comp — below that, the risk-adjusted comparison to NVIDIA doesn't work. I can sign this week at $240K+ and begin supporting the EU Sovereign AI pipeline immediately. The pre-IPO upside and Jim Keller's leadership make Tenstorrent my top choice."
