**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Tenstorrent lead teams building the software and hardware systems that make RISC-V AI silicon a production reality — from compiler teams and runtime platform groups to silicon verification and bring-up squads working on Blackhole and Wormhole chips. Under Jim Keller's leadership, EMs are expected to be deeply technical while scaling teams rapidly to meet Sovereign AI demand from governments worldwide. The late-stage startup environment (~$3.5B valuation) means EMs directly influence product direction and organizational design in ways impossible at larger semiconductor companies.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

Engineering Managers at Tenstorrent are uniquely positioned at the nexus of technical execution and Sovereign AI business strategy. As dozens of nations invest billions in AI independence — the EU's $48B Chips Act, India's $10B Semiconductor Mission, Japan's semiconductor revival, Gulf state AI programs — Tenstorrent needs EMs who can scale teams to deliver on sovereign deployment contracts. The Blackhole and Wormhole chip families, built on open-source RISC-V architecture, are the only viable alternative to NVIDIA's proprietary lock-in. EMs must recruit and retain elite talent (attracted by Jim Keller's legendary reputation), manage cross-functional execution across hardware and software, and ensure Tenstorrent's products meet the reliability and performance standards required by government customers. Candidates should negotiate for Sovereign AI delivery bonuses of $18K–$28K annually, tied to team delivery milestones for international AI programs. Jim Keller's track record (AMD Zen, Apple A-series, Tesla FSD) means Tenstorrent attracts world-class engineers — and the EM who can lead them commands a premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **Team Scale Equity Grants:** "I'll be scaling a team from 6 to 15+ engineers over 18 months to meet Sovereign AI delivery timelines. I'm requesting an equity grant that reflects team-building impact — an additional 25% over the standard EM grant, vesting over four years."
2. **Sovereign AI Delivery Bonus:** "My team's output directly enables Sovereign AI contracts worth tens of millions. I'm requesting a $20K–$28K annual Sovereign AI delivery bonus tied to quarterly deployment milestones across international programs."
3. **Competing Big Tech Manager Offer:** "I hold a management offer from [Google/Meta/Apple] at $340K total comp. While Tenstorrent's pre-IPO upside and Jim Keller's leadership are compelling, I need a base salary of at least $222K to offset the liquidity risk."
4. **Retention & Hiring Budget Authority:** "As EM, I'll need discretionary budget to make competitive offers to RISC-V talent. I'd like to negotiate a team hiring bonus pool of $50K–$80K that I can deploy to close critical candidates."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm thrilled about the opportunity to lead a team under Jim Keller at Tenstorrent. I have a competing EM offer from Apple at $345K total comp. Given Tenstorrent's Sovereign AI pipeline and the pre-IPO equity trajectory at ~$3.5B, I'm targeting $345K–$352K total comp: $222K base, $92K equity, and a $25K Sovereign AI delivery bonus. My accept-at floor is $318K total comp — below that threshold, the risk-adjusted comparison to Apple doesn't work for my family. I'm ready to sign this week at $330K+ and can start within a month. The equity upside and Jim Keller's leadership make this my top choice."
