**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Tenstorrent orchestrate the cross-functional execution of RISC-V AI silicon programs — coordinating chip design, software development, verification, manufacturing, and customer deployment timelines for the Blackhole and Wormhole families. Under Jim Keller's leadership, TPMs manage programs that span hardware tape-outs worth hundreds of millions of dollars and Sovereign AI customer commitments across dozens of nations. At a late-stage startup valued at ~$3.5B, TPMs have direct access to executive decision-making and own program outcomes that would require VP-level escalation at Intel or Qualcomm.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

TPMs at Tenstorrent are the connective tissue that makes Sovereign AI delivery possible. When a nation commits to deploying Tenstorrent's RISC-V AI silicon, the TPM manages the end-to-end program: from chip production scheduling and software SDK readiness to customer acceptance testing and deployment milestones. Dozens of nations — the EU, Japan, India, Canada, Gulf states — are pursuing Sovereign AI with aggressive timelines, and each program requires dedicated TPM coordination across Tenstorrent's hardware, software, and customer-facing teams. The Blackhole and Wormhole chip launches are among the most complex programs in the semiconductor industry, combining open-source RISC-V architecture, custom AI accelerator design, and Jim Keller's architectural vision (AMD Zen, Apple A-series, Tesla FSD). Candidates should negotiate for Sovereign AI program bonuses of $10K–$18K annually, tied to on-time delivery milestones for international AI infrastructure deployments. Your program management directly determines whether Tenstorrent delivers on its Sovereign AI commitments.

**Global Levers**

1. **Program Delivery Equity:** "I'll manage programs that determine Tenstorrent's ability to deliver Blackhole/Wormhole silicon on schedule. I'm requesting a 20% equity uplift reflecting the revenue-critical nature of program delivery at a ~$3.5B pre-IPO company."
2. **Sovereign AI Program Bonus:** "I'll coordinate the end-to-end delivery of Sovereign AI programs spanning multiple nations. I'm requesting a $12K–$18K annual Sovereign AI program bonus tied to on-time delivery milestones for international deployments."
3. **Silicon Program Management Scarcity:** "TPMs with semiconductor tape-out and AI silicon program experience are rare. My track record managing [chip tape-outs/silicon programs/hardware-software co-development] at [previous company] justifies a base salary at the 75th percentile: $155K+."
4. **Cross-Functional Scope Signing Bonus:** "I'll immediately take ownership of [specific Blackhole/Wormhole program milestone]. A $12K–$18K signing bonus reflects the immediate program ownership and the transition risk from my current role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited to manage the programs that bring Tenstorrent's RISC-V AI vision to production under Jim Keller's leadership. I have a competing TPM offer from [Google/Qualcomm/Intel] at $232K total comp. Given Tenstorrent's pre-IPO equity at ~$3.5B and my direct ownership of Sovereign AI delivery programs, I'm targeting $232K–$238K total comp: $155K base, $52K equity, and a $15K Sovereign AI program bonus. My accept-at floor is $215K total comp — below that, the risk premium versus my public company alternative doesn't pencil out. I can sign within 48 hours at $222K+ and begin Blackhole program coordination immediately."
