**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Tenstorrent define the product strategy for RISC-V AI silicon — prioritizing features for the Blackhole and Wormhole chip families, managing the developer ecosystem roadmap, and translating Sovereign AI customer requirements into engineering priorities. Under Jim Keller's technically-driven leadership, PMs must be deeply technical while also navigating complex international go-to-market strategies across dozens of countries pursuing AI independence. At a late-stage startup valued at ~$3.5B, PMs have outsized influence on product direction compared to equivalent roles at Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

Product Managers at Tenstorrent sit at the strategic center of the Sovereign AI opportunity. Dozens of nations — from the EU and Japan to India, Canada, and Gulf states — need open-architecture AI chips to build domestic AI capability independent of NVIDIA's proprietary ecosystem. PMs must translate these diverse national requirements into a coherent product roadmap for the Blackhole and Wormhole chip families. This means understanding government procurement processes, national AI strategy documents, export control implications, and the technical requirements of sovereign AI infrastructure. Jim Keller's leadership (AMD Zen, Apple A-series, Tesla FSD) attracts world-class engineering talent, but it takes exceptional PMs to channel that talent into products that win Sovereign AI contracts. Candidates should negotiate for Sovereign AI strategy bonuses of $12K–$20K annually, tied to international product launch milestones. Your product decisions directly determine whether the open RISC-V ecosystem can challenge NVIDIA's CUDA monopoly.

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Product Leadership Equity:** "As PM, I'll own the product roadmap that determines Tenstorrent's competitive position against NVIDIA. I'm requesting an equity grant reflecting product leadership impact — 25% above the standard PM allocation at ~$3.5B valuation."
2. **Sovereign AI Strategy Bonus:** "I'll be defining the product requirements for Sovereign AI deployments across multiple nations. I'm requesting a $15K–$20K annual Sovereign AI strategy bonus tied to international product launch and adoption milestones."
3. **Technical PM Scarcity:** "Product managers with deep semiconductor and AI silicon expertise are exceptionally rare. My background in [chip product management/AI infrastructure/developer ecosystems] directly applies to Tenstorrent's Blackhole/Wormhole roadmap — this scarcity justifies a $15K–$22K signing bonus."
4. **Go-to-Market Ownership:** "I'll own the developer ecosystem strategy that determines Tenstorrent's CUDA competitive response. This revenue-critical responsibility warrants a base salary at the 80th percentile: $178K+."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm passionate about Tenstorrent's mission to democratize AI silicon through RISC-V. I have a PM offer from AMD at $265K total comp. Given Tenstorrent's Sovereign AI product pipeline and pre-IPO equity at ~$3.5B, I'm targeting $268K–$275K total comp: $178K base, $65K equity, and a $18K Sovereign AI strategy bonus. My accept-at floor is $248K total comp — below that, the liquidity discount versus AMD doesn't pencil out. I can sign within 48 hours at $258K+ and am ready to start in three weeks. The chance to define product strategy under Jim Keller is a career-defining opportunity."
