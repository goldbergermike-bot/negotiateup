### Data Engineer | Tenstorrent Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** [Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Sovereign AI Bonus] | RISC-V AI Silicon | Blackhole/Wormhole Architecture | Jim Keller Leadership | Data Platform Criticality Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$128K–C$170K | C$42K–C$65K | 10–15% | C$198K–C$275K |
| Austin | $122K–$165K | $36K–$55K | 10–15% | $182K–$252K |
| Remote US | $115K–$158K | $34K–$52K | 10–15% | $172K–$242K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Tenstorrent build the data infrastructure that powers silicon design analytics, chip performance telemetry, manufacturing yield analysis, and customer deployment monitoring for the Blackhole and Wormhole chip families. Under Jim Keller's data-driven leadership, every tape-out decision, compiler optimization, and customer deployment relies on robust data pipelines that process terabytes of silicon simulation, regression testing, and production telemetry data. At a late-stage startup valued at ~$3.5B, data engineers build foundational infrastructure that will scale with the company through IPO and beyond.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

Data Engineers at Tenstorrent enable the Sovereign AI mission through infrastructure. As dozens of nations deploy Tenstorrent's RISC-V AI silicon — from the EU's Chips Act programs to India's Semiconductor Mission and Gulf state AI infrastructure — each deployment generates performance telemetry, usage analytics, and reliability data that must be ingested, processed, and analyzed to improve the product and validate sovereign deployment SLAs. Data engineers build the pipelines that connect Sovereign AI customer deployments back to Tenstorrent's engineering teams, creating feedback loops that drive chip improvements for the Blackhole and Wormhole families. Jim Keller's track record (AMD Zen, Apple A-series, Tesla FSD) demands rigorous, data-driven engineering — and data engineers provide the infrastructure that makes this possible. Candidates should negotiate for Sovereign AI data platform bonuses of $10K–$16K annually, tied to deployment telemetry pipeline delivery and sovereign customer data compliance milestones.

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Platform Foundation Equity:** "I'll build the data infrastructure that powers every engineering and business decision at Tenstorrent. I'm requesting a 20% equity uplift reflecting the foundational nature of data engineering at a pre-IPO company valued at ~$3.5B."
2. **Sovereign AI Data Platform Bonus:** "I'll build the telemetry and analytics pipelines that serve Sovereign AI customers across multiple nations, including compliance with sovereign data residency requirements. I'm requesting a $12K–$16K annual Sovereign AI data platform bonus tied to pipeline delivery milestones."
3. **Silicon Data Engineering Scarcity:** "Data engineers with semiconductor telemetry, EDA pipeline, and manufacturing yield analysis experience are exceptionally rare. My background in [silicon data pipelines/manufacturing analytics/hardware telemetry] justifies a base salary at the 75th percentile: $158K+."
4. **Infrastructure Ownership Signing Bonus:** "I'll take ownership of critical data pipelines from day one, including silicon regression analytics and customer deployment telemetry. A $10K–$15K signing bonus reflects the immediate infrastructure ownership and my transition from [current company]."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building the data infrastructure backbone for Tenstorrent's RISC-V AI silicon under Jim Keller's leadership. I have a competing offer from [Databricks/Snowflake/AMD] at $235K total comp. Given Tenstorrent's pre-IPO equity at ~$3.5B and the Sovereign AI data platform I'll build, I'm targeting $238K–$242K total comp: $158K base, $52K equity, and a $14K Sovereign AI data platform bonus. My accept-at floor is $218K total comp — below that, the risk premium versus my alternative doesn't clear. I can sign within 48 hours at $228K+ and start building the Blackhole telemetry pipeline immediately."
