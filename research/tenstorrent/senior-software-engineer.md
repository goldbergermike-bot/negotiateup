**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Tenstorrent own critical subsystems in the AI software stack — from MLIR-based compilers and TT-Metalium runtime to the full toolchain enabling Blackhole and Wormhole silicon to run production AI workloads. Jim Keller has publicly stated that Tenstorrent's competitive advantage lies in tight software-hardware co-design, making senior software talent as strategically important as the chip architects themselves. At this level, engineers directly influence the developer experience that will determine whether RISC-V AI silicon can challenge NVIDIA's CUDA moat across dozens of Sovereign AI programs worldwide.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

Tenstorrent's RISC-V-based AI processors — the Blackhole and Wormhole chip families — are the only viable open-architecture alternative to NVIDIA's proprietary CUDA ecosystem. This matters enormously in 2026 because dozens of nations are pursuing Sovereign AI strategies, building domestic AI capability that cannot be cut off by US export controls or single-vendor lock-in. Senior Software Engineers are the linchpin of this effort: they design the compiler passes, optimize the runtime, and build the SDK that makes Tenstorrent silicon accessible to sovereign AI programs in the EU, Japan, India, Canada, and the Gulf states. Jim Keller's legendary track record (AMD Zen, Apple A-series, Tesla FSD chip) ensures Tenstorrent attracts elite talent — and retaining that talent requires compensation that reflects the Sovereign AI premium. Candidates should negotiate for a dedicated Sovereign AI project bonus of $12K–$22K annually, framing their work as enabling national AI independence. Pre-IPO equity at ~$3.5B valuation positions senior engineers for significant upside as Sovereign AI government contracts accelerate.

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Multiplier:** "At the senior level, I expect equity to represent 25–30% of total comp. Given Tenstorrent's ~$3.5B valuation and the Blackhole production ramp, I'd like an additional 20–25% equity grant — this is standard for senior engineers at late-stage startups with this trajectory."
2. **Sovereign AI Project Bonus:** "My work on the compiler/runtime stack directly enables Sovereign AI deployments across multiple countries. I'm requesting a $15K–$22K annual Sovereign AI bonus tied to international deployment milestones."
3. **Competing NVIDIA/AMD Offer Leverage:** "I hold a competing offer from [NVIDIA/AMD] at $285K total comp. While I'm drawn to Tenstorrent's mission and pre-IPO upside, I need the liquid comp to be within 10–15% of my alternative — that means a base of at least $188K."
4. **RISC-V Scarcity Premium:** "There are fewer than 2,000 engineers globally with production RISC-V toolchain experience. My background in [LLVM/MLIR/RISC-V compiler work] is directly applicable to TT-Metalium, and this scarcity justifies a $20K–$28K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm genuinely excited about Tenstorrent's RISC-V roadmap and Jim Keller's vision for open AI silicon. I have a competing offer from NVIDIA at $285K total comp. Given Tenstorrent's pre-IPO equity upside and the Sovereign AI tailwind, I'm targeting $290K–$298K in total comp: $192K base, $72K equity, and an $18K Sovereign AI project bonus. My accept-at floor is $268K total comp — below that, the risk premium of a pre-IPO startup doesn't clear my NVIDIA alternative. I can sign within 48 hours if we align on a package at $280K+. The equity upside at ~$3.5B makes this a partnership, not just a job."
