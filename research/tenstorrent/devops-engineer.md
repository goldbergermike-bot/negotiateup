### DevOps Engineer | Tenstorrent Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** [Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Sovereign AI Bonus] | RISC-V AI Silicon | Blackhole/Wormhole Architecture | Jim Keller Leadership | Infrastructure Criticality Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$125K–C$165K | C$40K–C$62K | 8–12% | C$192K–C$268K |
| Austin | $120K–$160K | $35K–$55K | 8–12% | $178K–$245K |
| Remote US | $112K–$152K | $32K–$52K | 8–12% | $168K–$235K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Tenstorrent build and maintain the CI/CD infrastructure, silicon build pipelines, regression testing frameworks, and cloud-based emulation environments that keep the Blackhole and Wormhole chip development on schedule. Under Jim Keller's leadership, engineering velocity is paramount — every hour of build pipeline latency translates directly into delayed silicon tape-outs and lost competitive ground against NVIDIA. At a late-stage startup valued at ~$3.5B, DevOps engineers own infrastructure decisions that would require committee approval at Intel or AMD.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

DevOps Engineers at Tenstorrent enable the Sovereign AI mission at the infrastructure level. As dozens of nations deploy Tenstorrent's RISC-V AI silicon — from EU Chips Act beneficiaries to India's Semiconductor Mission and Gulf state AI programs — each deployment requires robust, reproducible build and deployment pipelines that can be operated by local teams. DevOps engineers build the infrastructure-as-code, automated testing, and deployment frameworks that make Sovereign AI deployments reliable and scalable across diverse international environments. The Blackhole and Wormhole chip families require silicon-grade CI/CD — regression suites that run across thousands of test vectors, emulation farms that validate firmware, and release pipelines that meet government certification standards. Jim Keller's track record (AMD Zen, Apple A-series, Tesla FSD) demands engineering infrastructure that matches the ambition. Candidates should negotiate for Sovereign AI infrastructure bonuses of $10K–$16K annually, tied to deployment pipeline reliability and international deployment readiness milestones.

**Global Levers**

1. **Infrastructure Criticality Equity:** "My CI/CD and build infrastructure work directly determines Tenstorrent's engineering velocity and silicon delivery timeline. I'm requesting a 20% equity uplift reflecting the pipeline-critical nature of DevOps at a pre-IPO chip company valued at ~$3.5B."
2. **Sovereign AI Infrastructure Bonus:** "I'll build the deployment pipelines that enable Sovereign AI customers worldwide to reliably deploy Tenstorrent silicon. I'm requesting a $12K–$16K annual Sovereign AI infrastructure bonus tied to deployment readiness and reliability milestones."
3. **Silicon DevOps Scarcity:** "DevOps engineers with semiconductor build pipeline experience — EDA tool integration, regression farm orchestration, silicon emulation infrastructure — are rare. My background in [silicon CI/CD/hardware emulation infrastructure] justifies a base salary at the 75th percentile: $152K+."
4. **On-Call and Infrastructure Ownership Signing Bonus:** "I'll own critical build infrastructure from day one, including on-call responsibilities for tape-out-blocking pipelines. A $10K–$15K signing bonus reflects the immediate infrastructure ownership and transition risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building the infrastructure backbone for Tenstorrent's RISC-V AI silicon under Jim Keller's leadership. I have a competing offer from [AWS/Google Cloud/AMD] at $228K total comp. Given Tenstorrent's pre-IPO equity at ~$3.5B and the Sovereign AI deployment pipeline I'll build, I'm targeting $230K–$235K total comp: $152K base, $52K equity, and a $14K Sovereign AI infrastructure bonus. My accept-at floor is $212K total comp — below that, the risk premium versus my big-tech alternative doesn't work. I can sign within 48 hours at $220K+ and can start within two weeks to support the Blackhole build pipeline ramp."
