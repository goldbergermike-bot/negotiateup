### Staff Software Engineer | Tenstorrent Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** [Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Sovereign AI Bonus] | RISC-V AI Silicon | Blackhole/Wormhole Architecture | Jim Keller Leadership | +20% Staff Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$210K–C$275K | C$85K–C$145K | 12–18% | C$332K–C$465K |
| Austin | $198K–$262K | $68K–$115K | 12–18% | $305K–$425K |
| Remote US | $188K–$252K | $65K–$110K | 12–18% | $292K–$408K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Tenstorrent set the technical direction for entire platform areas — compiler infrastructure, runtime architecture, performance engineering, or SDK design — directly shaping how the Blackhole and Wormhole chip families compete against NVIDIA's entrenched CUDA ecosystem. At this level, engineers work closely with Jim Keller and the chip architecture team on silicon-software co-optimization decisions that determine Tenstorrent's product-market fit across Sovereign AI programs worldwide. The staff level represents the highest individual contributor impact at a late-stage startup valued at ~$3.5B, with equity grants that can represent life-changing wealth upon IPO.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

At the Staff level, your architectural decisions directly determine whether Tenstorrent's RISC-V AI silicon can displace NVIDIA in Sovereign AI deployments. Dozens of nations — the EU (via the $48B Chips Act), India ($10B Semiconductor Mission), Japan, Canada, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and others — are investing tens of billions in domestic AI capability that cannot depend on a single proprietary vendor. Tenstorrent's Blackhole and Wormhole chips, built on open-source RISC-V architecture, are the only credible open alternative. Staff Engineers own the platform decisions that make or break these sovereign deployments: compiler performance parity with CUDA, runtime reliability for government-grade workloads, and SDK usability for national AI labs. Jim Keller's track record (AMD Zen, Apple A-series, Tesla FSD) validates that Tenstorrent can execute at the highest level. Candidates should negotiate for Sovereign AI project bonuses of $20K–$35K annually, plus accelerated equity vesting tied to Sovereign AI contract milestones. Your work doesn't just build a product — it enables national AI independence for dozens of countries.

**Global Levers**

1. **Equity-Heavy Package:** "At the staff level, I expect equity to represent 30–35% of total comp. Given the ~$3.5B valuation and the Sovereign AI pipeline, I'm requesting an additional 30% equity grant with a four-year vest — I want my interests deeply aligned with Tenstorrent's IPO trajectory."
2. **Sovereign AI Architect Bonus:** "I'll be making platform-level decisions that directly enable Sovereign AI deployments across multiple nations. I'm requesting a $25K–$35K annual Sovereign AI bonus, structured as a project milestone bonus tied to international deployment targets."
3. **Jim Keller Direct Report Premium:** "Working directly with Jim Keller on silicon-software co-design is a once-in-a-career opportunity, and the caliber of engineers this attracts means the bar is extraordinarily high. My compensation should reflect top-of-market for staff-level talent: $252K+ base."
4. **Architecture Ownership Signing Bonus:** "I'll be taking ownership of [specific platform area] from day one. A $35K–$50K signing bonus reflects the immediate impact expected at the staff level and offsets the transition risk from my current position."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply aligned with Tenstorrent's mission to build the open-architecture alternative to NVIDIA. I currently have a staff-level offer from [Google/Meta/AMD] at $395K total comp. I understand that Tenstorrent's pre-IPO equity represents significant upside beyond liquid comp, so I'm targeting $400K–$408K total comp: $252K base, $110K equity, and a $30K Sovereign AI architect bonus. My accept-at floor is $370K total comp — at that level, the equity upside at ~$3.5B valuation adequately compensates for the liquidity discount versus my public company alternative. I can commit within 72 hours at $385K+ and am prepared to start within three weeks."
