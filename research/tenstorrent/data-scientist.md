### Data Scientist | Tenstorrent Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** [Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Sovereign AI Bonus] | RISC-V AI Silicon | Blackhole/Wormhole Architecture | Jim Keller Leadership | +10% AI Data Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$135K–C$178K | C$45K–C$72K | 10–15% | C$208K–C$288K |
| Austin | $128K–$170K | $38K–$60K | 10–15% | $192K–$262K |
| Remote US | $120K–$165K | $35K–$58K | 10–15% | $182K–$252K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Tenstorrent drive critical performance benchmarking, workload characterization, and competitive analysis that shapes how the Blackhole and Wormhole chip families are positioned against NVIDIA in the market. Under Jim Keller's data-driven leadership, data science informs silicon architecture decisions, compiler optimization priorities, and go-to-market strategy for Sovereign AI customers worldwide. At a late-stage startup valued at ~$3.5B, data scientists have direct influence on product and business strategy — a level of impact typically reserved for far more senior roles at larger semiconductor companies.

**RISC-V AI Silicon — The Sovereign AI Premium**

Data Scientists at Tenstorrent enable the Sovereign AI story with hard evidence. When nations evaluate whether to build AI infrastructure on Tenstorrent's RISC-V chips versus NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem, they need rigorous benchmarking data, total-cost-of-ownership analyses, and workload performance comparisons. Data scientists produce the analytical foundation for these multi-billion-dollar national decisions. The Blackhole and Wormhole chip families must demonstrate competitive performance-per-dollar against NVIDIA's H100 and B200 — and the data scientists who produce these benchmarks directly influence whether Sovereign AI contracts land at Tenstorrent. Jim Keller's track record (AMD Zen, Apple A-series, Tesla FSD) has attracted elite talent who demand analytical rigor in every decision. Candidates should negotiate for Sovereign AI analytics bonuses of $10K–$18K annually, framed around the fact that their benchmarking and analysis work directly influences government procurement decisions worth billions.

**Global Levers**

1. **Benchmark Impact Equity:** "My benchmarking and competitive analysis will directly influence Sovereign AI procurement decisions worth billions. I'm requesting a 20% equity uplift reflecting the revenue impact of data-driven positioning against NVIDIA."
2. **Sovereign AI Analytics Bonus:** "I'll produce the performance benchmarks and TCO analyses that Sovereign AI customers use to justify Tenstorrent over NVIDIA. I'm requesting a $12K–$18K annual Sovereign AI analytics bonus tied to benchmark publication and customer adoption milestones."
3. **AI Workload Expertise Premium:** "Data scientists who understand AI workload characterization at the silicon level are exceptionally scarce. My experience with [transformer profiling/MLPerf benchmarking/hardware performance analysis] justifies a base salary at the 75th percentile: $165K+."
4. **Competitive Intelligence Signing Bonus:** "I'll be building Tenstorrent's competitive intelligence framework against NVIDIA from day one. A $12K–$18K signing bonus reflects the immediate strategic impact and my transition from [current company]."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the data science opportunity at Tenstorrent — the chance to shape Sovereign AI procurement decisions with rigorous analysis under Jim Keller's leadership is unique. I have a competing offer from [Google/Meta/AMD] at $245K total comp. Given Tenstorrent's pre-IPO equity at ~$3.5B and the Sovereign AI pipeline, I'm targeting $248K–$252K total comp: $165K base, $58K equity, and a $15K Sovereign AI analytics bonus. My accept-at floor is $228K total comp — below that, the risk-adjusted value doesn't clear my public company alternative. I can sign within 48 hours at $238K+ and start contributing to Blackhole benchmarking immediately."
