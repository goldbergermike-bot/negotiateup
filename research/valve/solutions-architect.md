**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Valve design the technical architecture for Steam's platform services, developer-facing SDK (Steamworks), partner integrations, and cross-platform infrastructure. The SA role at Valve is unique because of the flat org — SAs don't receive architecture assignments; they identify the highest-impact architectural work and drive it through influence. Valve's SA challenges span the Steam Store (e-commerce at gaming scale), Steamworks SDK (used by thousands of game developers), Steam Deck/SteamOS (hardware + software platform), content delivery (petabyte-scale CDN), and game server infrastructure (Dota 2, CS2). SAs at Valve also work on partner integrations — ensuring Steam works seamlessly with console platforms, GPU vendors, and game engine providers. With fewer than 400 employees, every architectural decision has outsized impact. [Source: Valve Architecture, Steamworks]
