**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Valve build the pipelines and infrastructure that process data from 130M+ monthly Steam users, billions of game library events, store transactions, matchmaking data from Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2, and Steam Deck telemetry. Valve's data platform is unique because of the breadth of data sources: e-commerce (game purchases, in-app purchases), social (friends, groups, community), gaming (play sessions, achievements, matchmaking), and hardware (Steam Deck telemetry, Steam Hardware Survey). This data powers Steam's recommendation algorithm, pricing optimization, developer analytics (Steamworks data), anti-cheat (VAC system), and business intelligence. Despite Valve's small headcount (~350 employees), the data infrastructure handles scale comparable to much larger companies — Steam regularly peaks at 30M+ concurrent users.

**Level Mapping:** Valve Data Engineer (no levels) ~ Google L4-L5 DE = Meta E4-E5 DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Steam Data Scale:** "Steam processes data from 130M+ MAU, 30M+ peak concurrent users, and billions of transactions. This is e-commerce + gaming + social data at massive scale — comparable to the largest tech platforms."
2. **Recommendation Algorithm Data:** "Steam's recommendation algorithm drives game discovery and billions in sales. The data infrastructure powering this algorithm directly impacts Steam's core business."
3. **Multi-Domain Data Complexity:** "Valve's data spans e-commerce, social, gaming, and hardware — four distinct domains in one platform. This breadth requires versatile data engineering skills."
4. **Revenue Per Engineer:** "With ~350 employees and $6-8B+ revenue, every data engineer at Valve has extraordinary leverage. My comp should reflect this — $235K+ base with profit-sharing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $235K base with immediate profit-sharing eligibility. Data engineering at Steam's scale — 130M+ MAU, multi-domain data, billions in transactions — requires specialized expertise at a company that generates $15-20M+ per employee." Push base to $225K+.
