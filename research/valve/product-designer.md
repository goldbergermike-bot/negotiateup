**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Valve shape the interface and experience for Steam (130M+ MAU), the Steam Deck, SteamOS, and Valve's game titles. Valve's design philosophy is deeply user-centric — the company obsessively iterates on user experience through data-driven design, A/B testing at massive scale, and direct community feedback. Steam's UX has evolved dramatically over its 20+ year history, and designers at Valve are responsible for maintaining coherence across the store, library, community, Workshop, and social features. The Steam Deck introduced new design challenges — a handheld gaming device that must provide a console-like experience while maintaining access to Steam's full functionality. Designers at Valve operate within the flat org, meaning they choose projects and collaborate directly with engineers without PM intermediaries. [Source: Valve Design, Steam UX Evolution]

**Global Levers**

1. **130M+ MAU Interface:** "I'm designing interfaces used by 130M+ monthly active users. Every design decision impacts the world's largest PC gaming platform."
2. **Steam Deck Hardware + Software Design:** "The Steam Deck creates unique design challenges — merging a portable gaming device UX with a full-featured PC platform. Hardware + software design integration is specialized."
3. **Flat Org Design Autonomy:** "At Valve, designers choose their own projects and work directly with engineers. This autonomy means my design judgment is trusted at the highest level."
4. **Exceptional Designer Comp:** "Valve's profit-sharing model means designers earn significantly more than industry averages. I want $215K+ base with understanding that profit-sharing pushes TC well above market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base with profit-sharing eligibility. Designing for Steam's 130M+ users and the Steam Deck requires both platform UX expertise and hardware/software integration thinking." Push base to $200K+.
