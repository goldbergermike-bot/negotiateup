**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Valve protect the largest PC gaming platform in the world — 130M+ monthly active accounts, billions in annual transactions, and the Steam Wallet virtual currency system. Valve's security challenges are uniquely high-stakes: Steam accounts contain game libraries worth thousands of dollars, the Steam Community Market processes millions of virtual item trades, and the Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) system must detect and prevent cheating across thousands of games. Valve also faces DDoS attacks targeting competitive game servers (Dota 2, CS2 esports), account takeover campaigns, and trade-scam operations. With fewer than 400 employees, each security engineer at Valve has outsized responsibility — protecting infrastructure that would require a dedicated security team 5-10x larger at other companies. The flat org means security engineers have direct access to every system and can implement security improvements without bureaucratic overhead. [Source: Valve Security, VAC, Steam Guard]
