### Data Scientist | Valve Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Exceptional Base + Profit Sharing / Flat Org | Steam Monopoly Revenue

| Region | Base Salary | Profit Sharing | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------|------------|
| Bellevue WA | $175K–$250K | Significant (variable) | Profit-sharing based | $248K–$435K+ |
| Remote (rare) | $160K–$235K | Significant (variable) | Profit-sharing based | $228K–$408K+ |
| N/A — Valve is Bellevue-only | — | — | — | — |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Valve leverage one of the richest gaming platform datasets in the world — 130M+ MAU on Steam generating behavioral data across game purchases, play sessions, social interactions, community content, and hardware usage. DS at Valve powers the Steam recommendation algorithm (which drives game discovery for the entire PC gaming market), pricing optimization, matchmaking for Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2, anti-cheat detection (VAC system), and Dota 2 esports analytics. Valve's approach to DS is uniquely engineering-driven — in the flat org, data scientists are expected to own the full stack from research to production deployment. There are no PM gatekeepers — DS insights go directly to production. The Steam recommendation algorithm is one of the most impactful ML systems in gaming, directly determining which games succeed and which fail on the platform.

**Level Mapping:** Valve Data Scientist (no levels) ~ Google L4-L5 DS = Meta IC4-IC5 DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Kingmaker Algorithm:** "Steam's recommendation algorithm determines the success or failure of games on the world's largest PC gaming platform. DS work on this algorithm has outsized market impact — I'm not just optimizing for Valve, I'm shaping the PC gaming market."
2. **Full-Stack DS Ownership:** "Valve's flat org means DS own research-to-production. I'm not handing off models to engineering — I'm deploying them. This full-stack ownership is rare and valuable."
3. **Dota 2/CS2 Esports Analytics:** "Valve's esports titles (Dota 2, CS2) generate rich competitive data. DS work on matchmaking, balance, and esports analytics directly impacts competitive integrity for millions of players."
4. **VAC Anti-Cheat DS:** "Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) uses ML to detect cheaters across all Steam games. DS work on VAC protects the integrity of the entire PC gaming ecosystem."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $240K base with immediate profit-sharing eligibility. DS at Valve powers the recommendation algorithm that shapes the entire PC gaming market — there's no other DS role with comparable market-level impact." Push base to $230K+.
