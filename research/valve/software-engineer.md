### Software Engineer | Valve Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Exceptional Base + Profit Sharing / Flat Org | Steam Monopoly Revenue

| Region | Base Salary | Profit Sharing | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------|------------|
| Bellevue WA | $160K–$230K | Significant (variable) | Profit-sharing based | $220K–$400K+ |
| Remote (rare) | $148K–$215K | Significant (variable) | Profit-sharing based | $205K–$375K+ |
| N/A — Valve is Bellevue-only | — | — | — | — |

**Negotiation DNA**

Valve Corporation (private, Bellevue WA) is one of the most unique employers in the technology industry. With an estimated $6-8B+ in annual revenue and fewer than 400 employees, Valve generates more revenue per employee than virtually any company in tech. Valve's comp model is unlike any other: exceptional base salaries (well above market) + annual profit-sharing that has historically been extraordinarily generous ($100K-$300K+ per year reported). There are no RSUs (private company), no formal bonus targets — instead, Valve distributes a significant portion of company profits to employees based on peer-evaluated contribution. Valve's famous flat organizational structure means no managers, no titles, no formal hierarchy. Engineers choose their own projects, and teams form organically around the most impactful work. Getting hired at Valve is extremely selective — the company hires slowly and deliberately. If you receive an offer, you have already demonstrated exceptional capability.

**Level Mapping:** Valve SWE (no levels) ~ Google L4-L5 = Meta E4-E5 = Most companies' Senior-Staff level

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue Per Employee Frame:** "Valve generates $15-20M+ per employee annually. Even at the SWE level, every engineer at Valve has extraordinary leverage. My comp should reflect this — $220K+ base is appropriate for the most profitable tech company per headcount."
2. **Profit-Sharing Model Clarity:** "I need full transparency on profit-sharing: What's the typical payout range for engineers in their first year? Second year? What determines allocation? This is my most important negotiation priority."
3. **Selectivity Leverage:** "Valve's hiring process is legendarily selective. If I've received an offer, Valve has determined I'm exceptional. The base salary should reflect that I've cleared one of the highest bars in the industry."
4. **Flat Org Career Value:** "Valve's flat org means I own my career trajectory. There's no waiting for promotion — I demonstrate value and my comp increases through profit-sharing allocation. I want to understand how quickly the profit-sharing ramps."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "I'm targeting $220K base with full profit-sharing eligibility from day one. Valve's revenue per employee justifies exceptional comp, and I've demonstrated through the interview process that I meet Valve's bar. I'd like clarity on the profit-sharing model to properly evaluate the total package." Focus negotiation on base salary (push to $215K+) and profit-sharing eligibility timeline. The profit-sharing is where the real wealth-building happens.
