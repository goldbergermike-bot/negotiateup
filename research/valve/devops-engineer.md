**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Valve maintain the infrastructure that powers Steam — the dominant PC gaming distribution platform handling 130M+ MAU, 30M+ peak concurrent users, billions of annual game downloads, and massive traffic spikes during Steam Sales events. Valve's infrastructure is uniquely demanding: the Steam Content Delivery Network distributes petabytes of game data globally, game server infrastructure supports millions of concurrent players across Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2, and the Steam Store must handle traffic spikes during major sales that rival Black Friday-level e-commerce events. Valve also maintains SteamOS (Linux-based gaming OS) and Steam Deck firmware infrastructure. With fewer than 400 employees, DevOps engineers at Valve are responsible for infrastructure that would require teams 10x larger at other companies. [Source: Valve Infrastructure, Steam CDN]

**Global Levers**

1. **Steam CDN Scale:** "Steam's CDN distributes petabytes of game data globally. During Steam Sales, download traffic spikes rival the largest CDN events on the internet. Managing this infrastructure at Valve's headcount is extraordinary."
2. **30M+ Concurrent Users:** "Steam regularly peaks at 30M+ concurrent users. Keeping this platform running with ~350 employees means each DevOps engineer has outsized responsibility."
3. **Steam Sale Infrastructure:** "Steam Sales are among the largest e-commerce events in gaming. The infrastructure must handle 10x traffic spikes with zero downtime — while selling billions in game licenses."
4. **Revenue-Critical Uptime:** "Every minute of Steam downtime costs Valve measurable revenue. With $6-8B+ annual revenue and 365-day operation, uptime directly equals revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $235K base with immediate profit-sharing. Managing infrastructure for the world's largest PC gaming platform — with 130M+ MAU and petabytes of content delivery — at Valve's lean headcount requires specialized expertise." Push base to $225K+.
