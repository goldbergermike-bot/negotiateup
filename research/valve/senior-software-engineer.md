### Senior Software Engineer | Valve Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Exceptional Base + Profit Sharing / Flat Org | Steam Monopoly Revenue

| Region | Base Salary | Profit Sharing | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------|------------|
| Bellevue WA | $185K–$260K | Significant (variable) | Profit-sharing based | $260K–$460K+ |
| Remote (rare) | $170K–$245K | Significant (variable) | Profit-sharing based | $240K–$430K+ |
| N/A — Valve is Bellevue-only | — | — | — | — |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Valve operate at a level of autonomy and impact unmatched in the industry. Valve's flat org means there are no formal "Senior" titles — but engineers with 5-10+ years of experience and demonstrated expertise command higher base salaries and larger profit-sharing allocations. At Valve, being "Senior" means you're trusted to identify the highest-impact work, form or join teams to execute it, and ship results that drive significant value. Senior engineers at Valve frequently work across multiple projects — contributing to Steam platform features, game development (Counter-Strike, Dota 2, Half-Life), Steam Deck/SteamOS, and VR (previously). The peer evaluation system that determines profit-sharing allocation rewards engineers who have broad impact and help others succeed. [Source: Valve Corporation, Valve Culture]

**Level Mapping:** Valve Senior SWE (no levels) ~ Google L5 = Meta E5 = Staff at most gaming companies

**Global Levers**

1. **Peer-Evaluated Contribution:** "Valve's profit-sharing is allocated based on peer evaluation. I want to understand the evaluation process — what behaviors and contributions are valued most? How quickly can a new hire build the peer reputation needed for top-tier allocation?"
2. **Multi-Project Impact:** "At Valve, the most valued engineers contribute across multiple projects. My diverse experience in [areas] positions me to have broad impact from day one — which should translate to higher profit-sharing."
3. **Exceptional Base Anchor:** "Valve's base salaries are above market because profit-sharing is variable. I want $250K+ base to ensure strong guaranteed comp, with profit-sharing as upside."
4. **FAANG Senior Benchmarking:** "Google L5 and Meta E5 in Seattle/Bellevue are $350K-$450K TC with guaranteed RSUs. Valve's base needs to be strong enough that profit-sharing puts TC at or above this range."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $250K base with immediate profit-sharing eligibility. At Valve, Senior engineers self-direct work that impacts $6-8B+ in annual revenue. My experience at [previous company] demonstrates the autonomous, high-impact work style that Valve's culture rewards." Push base to $240K+. The profit-sharing will likely put total comp at $350K-$460K+.
