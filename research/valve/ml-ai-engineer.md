**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Valve work on some of the most impactful ML systems in gaming: Steam's recommendation algorithm (which determines game discovery for 130M+ users and billions in developer revenue), VAC anti-cheat detection, Dota 2/CS2 matchmaking optimization, game balance AI, and emerging generative AI applications. The Steam recommendation algorithm is arguably the single most impactful ML system in PC gaming — it determines which games players see, buy, and play. An improvement in recommendation quality directly translates to higher developer revenue and Steam's commission. Valve has also invested in ML for game development — AI-driven NPC behavior, procedural generation, and automated QA testing. In Valve's flat org, ML engineers own the full pipeline from research to production deployment with exceptional autonomy. [Source: Valve ML/AI, Steam Recommendations]
