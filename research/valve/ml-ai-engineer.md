**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Valve work on some of the most impactful ML systems in gaming: Steam's recommendation algorithm (which determines game discovery for 130M+ users and billions in developer revenue), VAC anti-cheat detection, Dota 2/CS2 matchmaking optimization, game balance AI, and emerging generative AI applications. The Steam recommendation algorithm is arguably the single most impactful ML system in PC gaming — it determines which games players see, buy, and play. An improvement in recommendation quality directly translates to higher developer revenue and Steam's commission. Valve has also invested in ML for game development — AI-driven NPC behavior, procedural generation, and automated QA testing. In Valve's flat org, ML engineers own the full pipeline from research to production deployment with exceptional autonomy. [Source: Valve ML/AI, Steam Recommendations]

**Level Mapping:** Valve ML Engineer (no levels) ~ Google L5 ML = Meta E5 ML = Netflix ML

**Global Levers**

1. **Steam Recommendation Algorithm Impact:** "The Steam recommendation algorithm influences billions in game sales. Every improvement I make to this algorithm directly impacts the success of thousands of developers and Valve's commission revenue."
2. **VAC Anti-Cheat ML:** "VAC protects the integrity of the entire PC gaming ecosystem. ML improvements to anti-cheat detection have platform-level impact across every game on Steam."
3. **Full-Stack ML Ownership:** "Valve's flat org means I own research-to-production for ML systems. No PM approval needed, no separate deployment team — I ship ML directly to 130M+ users."
4. **AI Premium at Valve:** "ML/AI engineers should command a premium even at Valve. I'm targeting $260K+ base with the AI premium applied, plus profit-sharing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $260K base with immediate profit-sharing eligibility and the AI premium applied. The Steam recommendation algorithm is the most impactful ML system in PC gaming — my expertise in [recommendation systems/NLP/RL] directly improves this system." Push base to $250K+.
