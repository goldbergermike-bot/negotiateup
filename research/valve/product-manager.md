**Negotiation DNA**

"Product Manager" at Valve is another paradoxical role — Valve's flat org means traditional PM functions (roadmap ownership, sprint planning, stakeholder management) don't exist in their conventional form. Instead, product thinking is distributed across all engineers. If Valve is hiring someone with PM skills, it's because they need someone who can identify the highest-impact product opportunities, rally engineers around those opportunities, and drive product decisions through influence rather than authority. Steam's product evolution — store features, discovery algorithms, community features, Steam Deck software, Remote Play, and developer tools — is driven by engineers who think like product managers. Pure PMs at Valve are extremely rare, making this role one of the most unique PM positions in the industry. [Source: Valve Organization, Steam Product Evolution]

**Level Mapping:** Valve PM (no formal title) ~ Google L6 PM = Meta IC6 PM = Director PM at most companies

**Global Levers**

1. **Flat Org PM Rarity:** "Pure PM roles at Valve are extraordinarily rare. If Valve is creating this role, it's because they've identified a critical product need that can't be served by engineers alone. This rarity justifies premium comp."
2. **Steam Product Influence:** "Product decisions on Steam impact 130M+ MAU and billions in developer revenue. Every feature I ship, every algorithm I improve, has platform-level impact."
3. **Influence-Based Product Leadership:** "At Valve, I can't assign engineers to build features. I must convince them that my product vision is the highest-impact use of their time. This requires exceptional product thinking and communication."
4. **Exceptional Base for PM Scarcity:** "PM roles at Valve are the scarcest position in the company. I'm targeting $245K+ base because Valve rarely hires PMs and I bring product skills that are complementary to the engineering-heavy org."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base with immediate profit-sharing eligibility. PM roles at Valve are the rarest positions in the company — if you're hiring for this role, it's because you need someone with specific product expertise that your engineering org can't replicate." Push base to $235K+.
