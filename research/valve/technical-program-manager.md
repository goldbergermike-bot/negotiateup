**Negotiation DNA**

"Technical Program Manager" at Valve is perhaps the most paradoxical role at the company. Valve's flat org explicitly rejects traditional project/program management — there are no sprints, no roadmaps, no Gantt charts. However, Valve does occasionally need someone to coordinate complex, multi-team efforts: hardware launches (Steam Deck), major platform migrations, Source 2 engine releases, esports event infrastructure (The International, CS Major), and large-scale infrastructure projects. If Valve is hiring for a TPM-like role, it's because the coordination complexity of a specific initiative exceeds what can be managed organically. This role requires someone who can provide structure without imposing hierarchy — facilitating coordination while respecting Valve's autonomous culture. TPM hires at Valve are extremely rare, making this one of the most unique program management positions in the industry. [Source: Valve Organization, Valve Hiring]

**Global Levers**

1. **Flat Org Coordination Rarity:** "TPM roles at Valve are the rarest in the company. If Valve is hiring for this, it's because they've identified a coordination challenge that their flat org can't solve organically. This rarity justifies premium comp."
2. **Hardware Launch Coordination:** If managing Steam Deck programs: "Coordinating a hardware launch — firmware, software, manufacturing, supply chain, marketing, developer relations — requires traditional program management skills applied to Valve's unconventional org."
3. **Esports Event Infrastructure:** If managing esports programs: "The International (Dota 2) and CS Majors have millions of viewers and significant prize pools. Infrastructure coordination for these events is high-stakes and high-visibility."
4. **Facilitation Without Authority:** "At Valve, I can't mandate timelines or assign resources. I facilitate coordination through influence, transparency, and shared goals. This is harder than hierarchical PM — and the results are better."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $240K base with immediate profit-sharing. TPM roles at Valve are extraordinarily rare — you're hiring for this because the coordination challenge requires specialized skills that complement Valve's flat org." Push base to $230K+.
