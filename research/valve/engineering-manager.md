**Negotiation DNA**

"Engineering Manager" at Valve is a paradox — Valve's famous flat organizational structure means there are technically no managers. However, Valve does hire people who perform management-adjacent functions: team leads who form around specific projects, "cabal" leaders for game development, and technical leads who guide large initiatives. If you're being hired for what would be an EM role at another company, you're joining Valve as an engineer who is expected to naturally attract people to high-impact projects through technical credibility and leadership. This is fundamentally different from hierarchical management — there are no direct reports, no performance reviews to give, and no promotion decisions to make. Instead, you lead by influence, technical vision, and the ability to organize people around shared goals. The comp is exceptional — equivalent to or exceeding EM comp at FAANG companies.

**Level Mapping:** Valve Lead/Cabal (no formal title) ~ Google L6 Manager = Meta M2 = Director at most companies

**Global Levers**

1. **Influence-Based Leadership Premium:** "Leading at Valve requires a fundamentally different skill set than hierarchical management. I must earn followership through technical credibility and vision — no one is assigned to my team. This influence-based leadership is rare and valuable."
2. **Project-Formation Ability:** "The most valued leaders at Valve can identify high-impact work, attract the right people, and ship results. I want to understand how the profit-sharing model rewards this project-formation ability."
3. **Exceptional Base for Leadership:** "Leadership roles at Valve carry the highest base salaries. I'm targeting $280K+ base because my ability to organize and lead without formal authority is the scarcest skill in Valve's flat org."
4. **No-Title Culture Navigation:** "I understand Valve's flat org and I thrive in autonomous environments. My experience at [previous company] leading cross-functional initiatives without formal authority directly transfers to Valve's culture."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $280K base with full profit-sharing eligibility from day one. Leading at Valve requires influence-based leadership that's harder than hierarchical management — and the results are measured in platform-level impact on $6-8B+ annual revenue." Push base to $270K+. Profit-sharing at the leadership level is reported at $200K-$400K+.
