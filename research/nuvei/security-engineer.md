**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Nuvei protect the most sensitive asset in fintech: payment transaction data flowing across 200+ markets and 700+ payment methods, all under the scrutiny that comes with Advent International's $6.3 billion investment. Nuvei's Electronic Currency Issuer platform, its e-money license obligations, and its operations in regulated verticals like i-Gaming, crypto, and high-risk merchant categories create a security surface area that few companies can match in complexity. A security breach at Nuvei wouldn't just be a data incident — it would threaten regulatory licenses across multiple jurisdictions, destroy merchant trust, and materially impact the valuation that Advent is building toward.

The Pay2All acquisition in Brazil has expanded Nuvei's security perimeter to include Brazilian payment infrastructure, data protection requirements under LGPD (Brazil's data protection law), and integration security challenges that arise when merging two payment platforms with different security architectures. Security engineers who can unify security postures across acquired entities while maintaining PCI-DSS Level 1 certification, Electronic Currency Issuer compliance, and e-money license security requirements are among the most scarce and valuable hires in fintech.

Your negotiation leverage as a security engineer stems from the asymmetric risk profile: security failures are existential for payment companies, while security improvements are table stakes for maintaining operating licenses. Nuvei's i-Gaming vertical adds additional security complexity — gaming regulators in every jurisdiction require specific security controls, penetration testing, and audit readiness that go beyond standard payment security requirements. Options vest over four years, and security engineers who maintain Nuvei's regulatory standing are well-positioned for retention incentives as Advent approaches its exit timeline.

### Advent PE — The Electronic Currency Issuer Premium

**1. The Existential Risk Protection Lever**
> "A security breach at a payment company processing transactions across 200+ markets isn't just a data incident — it's an existential threat to Nuvei's e-money licenses, merchant relationships, and the valuation Advent International is building on a $6.3 billion investment. Security engineers who can prevent these outcomes are worth multiples of their compensation. My ask of $200,000 base reflects the asymmetric value of protecting the Electronic Currency Issuer platform from catastrophic risk."

**2. The Pay2All Security Integration Lever**
> "The Pay2All Brazil acquisition creates a security integration challenge — unifying two payment platform security architectures while maintaining PCI-DSS Level 1 certification and compliance with Brazil's LGPD data protection requirements. I've led security integration for acquired financial platforms, and I know how to maintain security posture during M&A transitions. I'd like my options increased to $80,000/year to reflect the security integration value I'll deliver."

**3. The Electronic Currency Issuer License Protection Lever**
> "Nuvei's Electronic Currency Issuer capabilities and e-money licenses are contingent on meeting specific security requirements in every jurisdiction. A security failure that results in license revocation in even one market can cascade across 200+ markets. I can build and maintain the security architecture that protects these regulatory assets. My total comp target of $320,000 reflects the license protection premium."

**4. The i-Gaming Regulatory Security Lever**
> "Nuvei's i-Gaming vertical operates under gaming regulator security requirements that are among the most stringent in fintech — including mandatory penetration testing, segregated player fund security, and real-time fraud monitoring. Security engineers who understand the intersection of payment security and gaming regulation are extremely rare. I'd like a $20,000 signing bonus and consideration for a security certification allowance."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $210,000 base (New York) with $80,000/year options and 17% target bonus. Your realistic landing zone is $190,000-$205,000 base with $60,000-$75,000 options. Accept-at floor: $170,000 base with $48,000 options and a $18,000 signing bonus. Anchor on existential risk — calculate the cost of a single security breach (regulatory fines, license revocation, merchant churn, Advent valuation impact) and show that investing $30,000 more in a senior security engineer is trivial relative to the downside risk. No PE firm wants to explain a security breach to their LPs.
