**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Nuvei are the force multipliers that Advent International is counting on to execute its $6.3 billion investment thesis. You are not just managing engineers — you are building and leading teams that ship payment infrastructure across 200+ markets, maintain Electronic Currency Issuer compliance, and scale Nuvei's dominant i-Gaming vertical. Advent PE firms invest heavily in engineering management because they understand that team velocity and retention are the primary determinants of value creation during the hold period. An Engineering Manager who can recruit, retain, and accelerate a team of payment engineers is worth multiples of their compensation.

The Pay2All acquisition in Brazil has expanded Nuvei's engineering footprint and created integration teams that need experienced managers who can bridge cultural, technical, and regulatory differences between Brazilian and global engineering organizations. Engineering Managers who can lead cross-border teams while maintaining delivery velocity on Nuvei's 700+ payment method integrations and e-money license compliance obligations are in exceptionally high demand across the fintech sector.

Your negotiation leverage as an Engineering Manager comes from the talent market itself. Nuvei competes for engineering managers against Stripe, Adyen, Global Payments, and the broader fintech ecosystem. The PE-backed structure means Nuvei can offer competitive options packages that vest over four years, with potential upside at Advent's exit. Montreal-based managers should push for parity with Toronto and US-adjusted compensation, particularly given the complexity of managing teams that work across Electronic Currency Issuer platforms, regulated gaming payments, crypto transaction processing, and high-risk merchant verticals.

### Advent PE — The Electronic Currency Issuer Premium

**1. The Team Velocity Multiplier Lever**
> "Advent International's value creation plan depends on engineering velocity, and engineering managers are the primary lever for team output. I've consistently increased team delivery velocity by 30-40% within two quarters through improved processes, strategic hiring, and technical direction. My ask of $255,000 base reflects the multiplier effect I'll have on your most critical engineering teams."

**2. The Pay2All Integration Team Leadership Lever**
> "The Pay2All Brazil acquisition requires engineering managers who can lead cross-border integration teams — bridging Brazilian and global engineering cultures while maintaining delivery velocity. I've led exactly this type of M&A integration team, and I understand how to keep engineers productive during organizational change. I'd like my options increased to $120,000/year to reflect the integration leadership premium."

**3. The Electronic Currency Issuer Team Building Lever**
> "Building and retaining teams that can develop and maintain Electronic Currency Issuer platforms across 200+ markets requires an engineering manager with deep fintech domain knowledge. I can recruit engineers who understand both distributed systems and e-money license compliance — a hiring skill set that's rare among engineering managers. My total comp target of $430,000 reflects this specialized team-building capability."

**4. The i-Gaming Talent Retention Lever**
> "Nuvei's i-Gaming vertical leadership depends on retaining engineers with specialized knowledge of real-time gaming payment processing and regulatory compliance. Engineering managers who can keep i-Gaming teams engaged and productive directly protect Nuvei's competitive moat. I'd like a $30,000 signing bonus and a retention bonus structure tied to team retention metrics."
