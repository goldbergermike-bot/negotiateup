**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Nuvei sit at the intersection of Advent International's $6.3 billion investment thesis and the technical platform that must deliver on it. You are defining the product roadmap for a payment platform that spans 200+ markets, supports 700+ alternative payment methods, and holds Electronic Currency Issuer capabilities that differentiate Nuvei from commodity payment processors. In a PE-backed environment, product managers have outsized influence because every roadmap decision directly impacts the value creation timeline — Advent needs PMs who can prioritize features that drive revenue growth and margin expansion.

The Pay2All acquisition in Brazil presents a product integration challenge that requires PMs who understand both the Brazilian payment landscape and Nuvei's global platform capabilities. Product Managers who can identify cross-sell opportunities between Pay2All's merchant base and Nuvei's 700+ payment method portfolio, while navigating the regulatory requirements of e-money license compliance, will be among the most valuable hires in the organization. Nuvei's i-Gaming vertical leadership also demands product managers with domain expertise in regulated gaming payments — understanding player deposit flows, withdrawal processing, and jurisdictional compliance requirements.

Your negotiation leverage as a Product Manager is amplified by the PE timeline. Advent International needs PMs who can make high-conviction product bets that generate returns within the hold period. Product Managers who have shipped payment products at scale, particularly in regulated verticals like i-Gaming, crypto, and high-risk merchant categories, command premium compensation. Options vest over four years with potential upside tied to Advent's exit, making the equity component a significant negotiation lever.

### Advent PE — The Electronic Currency Issuer Premium

**1. The PE Roadmap Acceleration Lever**
> "Advent International's value creation plan requires a product manager who can prioritize features that drive revenue growth within the hold period. I've managed payment product roadmaps that generated $50M+ in incremental ARR, and I understand how to translate PE investment theses into product strategy. My ask of $200,000 base reflects the strategic value of a PM who can accelerate Nuvei's roadmap for Electronic Currency Issuer capabilities."

**2. The Pay2All Product Integration Lever**
> "The Pay2All Brazil acquisition creates a product integration opportunity — merging Pay2All's merchant base with Nuvei's 700+ payment methods and Electronic Currency Issuer platform. I've led post-acquisition product integration at scale, identifying cross-sell opportunities that drove 25% revenue uplift. I'd like my options increased to $85,000/year to reflect the revenue I'll generate through Pay2All product integration."

**3. The Electronic Currency Issuer Product Strategy Lever**
> "Nuvei's Electronic Currency Issuer capabilities and e-money license portfolio represent a product differentiation opportunity that most payment platforms can't replicate. I can build a product strategy that monetizes these regulatory assets across 200+ markets. My total comp target of $330,000 reflects the strategic PM premium in regulated fintech."

**4. The i-Gaming Product Leadership Lever**
> "Nuvei's i-Gaming vertical is the company's competitive moat, and product managers who understand gaming payment flows — deposit optimization, withdrawal speed, jurisdictional compliance — directly drive merchant retention and revenue growth. I'd like a $20,000 signing bonus to reflect the domain expertise premium for i-Gaming payment product management."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $210,000 base (New York) with $85,000/year options and 18% target bonus. Your realistic landing zone is $190,000-$200,000 base with $65,000-$80,000 options. Accept-at floor: $175,000 base with $55,000 options and a $18,000 signing bonus. Anchor on the PE value creation narrative — product managers at Advent portfolio companies are compensated for their ability to translate investment theses into shipped products. Remind them that a PM who can prioritize the right Electronic Currency Issuer features across 200+ markets is worth $500K+ in accelerated revenue per quarter.
