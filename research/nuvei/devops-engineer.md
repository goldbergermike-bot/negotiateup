**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Nuvei are the infrastructure backbone of a payment platform processing transactions across 200+ markets, backed by Advent International's $6.3 billion investment. When Nuvei's Electronic Currency Issuer platform goes down, every second of downtime translates to lost transaction volume and merchant trust erosion. DevOps engineers who can maintain 99.99% uptime across 700+ payment method integrations, manage infrastructure that complies with e-money license requirements across multiple jurisdictions, and scale systems to handle i-Gaming transaction spikes during major sporting events are the unsung heroes of Nuvei's value creation story.

The Pay2All acquisition in Brazil has expanded Nuvei's infrastructure footprint to include Brazilian cloud regions, data sovereignty requirements, and new deployment pipelines that need integration with the global DevOps practice. DevOps engineers who can unify multi-region infrastructure while maintaining compliance with local regulatory requirements — including the specific hosting and data residency requirements of Electronic Currency Issuer licenses — are in high demand across the fintech industry.

Your negotiation leverage comes from the catastrophic cost of infrastructure failures in payment processing. A single extended outage can cost Nuvei millions in lost transactions and permanent merchant churn. Advent International's PE model demands operational excellence, and DevOps engineers are the primary insurance policy against downtime. Options vest over four years, and DevOps engineers who demonstrate infrastructure reliability improvements are well-positioned for retention grants as Advent approaches its exit timeline.

### Advent PE — The Electronic Currency Issuer Premium

**1. The Uptime Revenue Protection Lever**
> "In payment processing, uptime equals revenue. Every minute of downtime across Nuvei's 200+ markets costs the company significant transaction volume that merchants may permanently redirect to competitors. Advent International's $6.3 billion investment depends on infrastructure that never fails. My ask of $185,000 base reflects the revenue protection value of a DevOps engineer who can maintain 99.99% uptime across the Electronic Currency Issuer platform."

**2. The Pay2All Infrastructure Integration Lever**
> "The Pay2All Brazil acquisition requires infrastructure integration — merging Brazilian cloud deployments, data sovereignty compliance, and deployment pipelines into Nuvei's global DevOps practice. I've managed exactly this type of multi-region infrastructure unification for regulated financial platforms. I'd like my options increased to $70,000/year to reflect the infrastructure integration value I'll deliver."

**3. The Electronic Currency Issuer Compliance Infrastructure Lever**
> "Nuvei's e-money license obligations require infrastructure that meets specific regulatory standards for data handling, audit logging, disaster recovery, and geographic data residency. Building and maintaining compliance-grade infrastructure across 200+ markets requires specialized DevOps knowledge. My total comp target of $290,000 reflects this regulatory infrastructure premium."

**4. The i-Gaming Scalability Lever**
> "Nuvei's i-Gaming vertical experiences massive transaction spikes during major events — Super Bowl, World Cup, Champions League finals — that require infrastructure capable of 10-50x normal throughput. DevOps engineers who can architect auto-scaling payment infrastructure that handles these spikes while maintaining regulatory compliance across gaming jurisdictions are rare. I'd like a $16,000 signing bonus to reflect this specialized scalability expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $195,000 base (New York) with $70,000/year options and 16% target bonus. Your realistic landing zone is $175,000-$190,000 base with $52,000-$65,000 options. Accept-at floor: $155,000 base with $42,000 options and a $14,000 signing bonus. Frame your value through uptime protection — calculate the cost of a 1-hour outage across Nuvei's 200+ markets and show that your infrastructure improvements prevent losses worth 50-100x your compensation. Advent understands insurance premiums against catastrophic platform failures.
