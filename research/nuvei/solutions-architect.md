**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Nuvei are the technical bridge between Advent International's $6.3 billion investment and the enterprise merchants who generate the transaction volume that drives valuation. You are designing payment integration architectures for merchants operating across 200+ markets, leveraging Nuvei's 700+ alternative payment methods, and positioning the Electronic Currency Issuer platform as a strategic capability that differentiates Nuvei from commodity payment processors. In a PE-backed environment, solutions architects who can close enterprise deals by designing compelling technical architectures directly impact the revenue growth metrics that determine Advent's return.

The Pay2All acquisition in Brazil has expanded Nuvei's solution architecture requirements to include Brazilian payment rails — PIX, Boleto Bancario, local card schemes — that need to be integrated into enterprise merchant architectures alongside global payment methods. Solutions Architects who can design multi-market payment flows that incorporate Pay2All's Brazilian capabilities, Nuvei's i-Gaming payment expertise, and the company's e-money license compliance requirements across multiple jurisdictions are exceptionally valuable in the pre-sales and post-sales technical engagement process.

Your negotiation leverage comes from the direct revenue attribution of solutions architecture work. Enterprise merchants choosing between Nuvei, Stripe, and Adyen often make their decision based on the quality of the technical architecture proposed by the solutions architect. A solutions architect who can design compelling Electronic Currency Issuer integrations for merchants in regulated verticals like i-Gaming, crypto, and high-risk categories directly drives deal closure. Options vest over four years under Advent's PE structure, with additional leverage for solutions architects who can demonstrate pipeline influence metrics.

### Advent PE — The Electronic Currency Issuer Premium

**1. The Deal Closure Attribution Lever**
> "Solutions architects in payment processing are directly attributable to deal closure — when I design a compelling integration architecture for an enterprise merchant, I'm closing revenue that flows directly to Nuvei's top line. Advent International understands that revenue-attributed roles command premium compensation. My ask of $225,000 base reflects the pipeline influence I'll have on Nuvei's enterprise merchant acquisition across 200+ markets."

**2. The Pay2All Cross-Sell Architecture Lever**
> "The Pay2All Brazil acquisition creates a cross-sell opportunity for solutions architects who can design integration architectures that combine Brazilian payment methods with Nuvei's global platform for existing enterprise merchants. I've designed multi-market payment architectures that unlocked $20M+ in cross-sell revenue. I'd like my options increased to $90,000/year to reflect the revenue generation value of Pay2All cross-sell architectures."

**3. The Electronic Currency Issuer Enterprise Integration Lever**
> "Nuvei's Electronic Currency Issuer capabilities and e-money license portfolio give the platform a unique enterprise value proposition that most payment processors can't match. I can design integration architectures that position these regulatory assets as competitive differentiators for merchants in 200+ markets. My total comp target of $370,000 reflects the enterprise revenue impact of this architectural expertise."

**4. The i-Gaming Vertical Architecture Lever**
> "Nuvei's i-Gaming vertical requires solutions architects who can design payment architectures for gaming operators that handle real-time deposits, instant withdrawals, multi-jurisdictional compliance, and responsible gaming requirements. This is a niche architectural discipline that directly protects Nuvei's most valuable vertical. I'd like a $22,000 signing bonus to reflect the i-Gaming domain expertise premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $235,000 base (New York) with $95,000/year options and 18% target bonus. Your realistic landing zone is $210,000-$225,000 base with $72,000-$88,000 options. Accept-at floor: $195,000 base with $60,000 options and a $20,000 signing bonus. Anchor on deal attribution — calculate the enterprise deals you've influenced in previous roles and show the revenue multiple relative to your compensation. Remind Advent that solutions architects who can position Nuvei's Electronic Currency Issuer platform against Stripe and Adyen in enterprise RFPs are worth 10-20x their cost in captured revenue.
