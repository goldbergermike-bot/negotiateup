**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Nuvei are the execution engine that transforms Advent International's $6.3 billion investment thesis into shipped platform capabilities. In a PE-backed environment where every quarter matters for value creation, TPMs who can coordinate complex cross-functional programs — spanning the Electronic Currency Issuer platform, 200+ market payment integrations, 700+ alternative payment methods, and regulatory compliance workstreams — are among the highest-leverage hires. Advent's portfolio companies consistently prioritize TPM hiring because program execution velocity is the primary determinant of whether value creation milestones are hit on schedule.

The Pay2All acquisition in Brazil represents exactly the type of cross-functional integration program that demands experienced TPMs. Coordinating the technical integration of Pay2All's Brazilian payment infrastructure with Nuvei's global platform involves engineering, compliance, product, operations, and legal teams across multiple time zones and regulatory jurisdictions. TPMs who can drive this integration to completion while maintaining delivery velocity on Nuvei's i-Gaming vertical roadmap and e-money license compliance programs are in critical demand.

Your negotiation leverage as a TPM comes from the time-value of execution. Advent's hold period creates hard deadlines for platform milestones, and TPMs who can compress timelines by 20-30% through better program management generate outsized returns on their compensation. Options vest over four years, aligning TPM incentives with the PE exit timeline. Montreal-based TPMs should benchmark against Toronto tech compensation and push for the fintech complexity premium that reflects managing programs across regulated payment verticals.

### Advent PE — The Electronic Currency Issuer Premium

**1. The PE Timeline Compression Lever**
> "Advent International's value creation plan runs on a defined timeline, and TPMs who can compress delivery schedules by 20-30% through better cross-functional coordination directly accelerate the return on a $6.3 billion investment. I've consistently delivered complex fintech programs ahead of schedule, and my ask of $210,000 base reflects the time-value of execution in a PE-backed environment."

**2. The Pay2All Integration Program Lever**
> "The Pay2All Brazil acquisition is a multi-quarter integration program spanning engineering, compliance, operations, and legal across multiple jurisdictions. I've managed exactly this type of post-acquisition technical integration, coordinating 50+ person cross-functional teams to deliver on aggressive timelines. I'd like my options increased to $85,000/year to reflect the program leadership value I'll deliver on the Pay2All integration."

**3. The Electronic Currency Issuer Compliance Program Lever**
> "Nuvei's Electronic Currency Issuer platform and e-money license obligations require ongoing compliance programs across 200+ markets — each with distinct regulatory requirements, audit timelines, and reporting obligations. Managing these overlapping compliance workstreams while maintaining feature delivery velocity requires specialized TPM expertise. My total comp target of $340,000 reflects this regulatory program management premium."

**4. The i-Gaming Program Coordination Lever**
> "Nuvei's i-Gaming vertical requires coordinated program delivery across payment processing, regulatory compliance, fraud detection, and player experience teams — often under tight regulatory deadlines tied to market launches and license renewals. TPMs who can orchestrate i-Gaming payment programs across multiple gaming jurisdictions simultaneously command a premium. I'd like a $18,000 signing bonus to bridge the transition from my current role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $220,000 base (New York) with $85,000/year options and 17% target bonus. Your realistic landing zone is $195,000-$210,000 base with $65,000-$80,000 options. Accept-at floor: $180,000 base with $55,000 options and a $16,000 signing bonus. Anchor on timeline compression value — calculate the revenue impact of launching Electronic Currency Issuer features one quarter earlier across 200+ markets and show that a TPM who compresses timelines by even two weeks per program generates 20-50x their incremental compensation. Advent's PE model deeply values execution speed.
