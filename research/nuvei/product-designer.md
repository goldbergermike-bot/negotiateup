**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Nuvei shape the merchant and partner experience for a payment platform backed by Advent International's $6.3 billion investment. Design in the payments space is fundamentally different from consumer product design — you are creating interfaces for Electronic Currency Issuer dashboards, payment orchestration tools, and compliance workflows that merchants across 200+ markets rely on to manage millions of transactions. Nuvei's 700+ payment method integrations mean designers must create scalable, localized experiences that work across vastly different payment cultures, from Brazilian PIX flows (driven by the Pay2All acquisition) to European e-money license compliance interfaces.

The i-Gaming vertical adds another design dimension — product designers who understand the unique UX requirements of gaming payment interfaces, including deposit flows, withdrawal experiences, and responsible gaming compliance screens, are in high demand across the fintech sector. Nuvei's competitive position against Stripe and Adyen in developer and merchant experience means design quality directly impacts merchant acquisition and retention metrics that Advent International tracks closely.

Your negotiation leverage comes from the increasing recognition that design quality drives conversion rates in payment processing. A 1% improvement in checkout conversion across Nuvei's merchant base translates to millions in additional transaction volume. Options vest over four years under the PE structure, with potential upside at Advent's exit. Montreal-based designers should benchmark against Toronto design compensation and push for the fintech premium that reflects the regulatory and multi-market complexity of payment design.

### Advent PE — The Electronic Currency Issuer Premium

**1. The Conversion Impact Lever**
> "In payment processing, design directly drives revenue — a 1% improvement in checkout conversion across Nuvei's merchant base can generate millions in incremental transaction volume. Advent International's investment thesis depends on growing payment volume, and I'm the designer who can move that needle. My ask of $170,000 base reflects the direct revenue impact of payment UX design."

**2. The Pay2All Design Integration Lever**
> "The Pay2All Brazil acquisition requires design work to integrate Brazilian payment experiences — PIX, Boleto, local card schemes — into Nuvei's global merchant dashboard. I've designed multi-market payment interfaces that maintain consistency while respecting local payment behaviors. I'd like my options increased to $50,000/year to reflect the design integration value I'll deliver for the Pay2All platform."

**3. The Electronic Currency Issuer Dashboard Lever**
> "Nuvei's Electronic Currency Issuer platform needs a world-class merchant dashboard that makes complex regulatory data accessible and actionable across 200+ markets. Designing for e-money license compliance, transaction monitoring, and currency issuance workflows requires specialized fintech UX expertise. My total comp target of $255,000 reflects this domain specialization."

**4. The i-Gaming UX Premium Lever**
> "Nuvei's i-Gaming vertical has specific UX requirements — player deposit optimization, instant withdrawal experiences, responsible gaming compliance screens — that require a designer who understands gaming payment user psychology. I'd like a $15,000 signing bonus to reflect the i-Gaming design expertise premium."
