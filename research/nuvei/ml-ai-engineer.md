**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Nuvei operate at the frontier of payment intelligence, building machine learning systems that detect fraud, optimize transaction routing, and power risk scoring across 200+ markets and 700+ alternative payment methods — all backed by Advent International's $6.3 billion investment. The Electronic Currency Issuer platform generates complex transaction patterns that require sophisticated ML models to monitor, and Nuvei's position in regulated verticals like i-Gaming, crypto, and high-risk merchant categories demands AI systems that can adapt to rapidly evolving fraud vectors while maintaining compliance with e-money license requirements. Montreal's status as a global AI hub (home to MILA and a dense concentration of ML talent) creates both opportunity and competition for Nuvei's AI engineering hires.

The Pay2All acquisition in Brazil has introduced new transaction patterns, fraud vectors, and payment behaviors that Nuvei's ML models must learn to handle. Brazilian payment fraud differs significantly from European and North American patterns, and ML engineers who can build models that generalize across diverse markets while maintaining precision in each local context are exceptionally valuable. The i-Gaming vertical adds another layer of ML complexity — real-time risk scoring for gaming transactions must balance fraud prevention with player experience, requiring models that operate at sub-second latency with extremely low false positive rates.

Your negotiation leverage as an ML/AI Engineer comes from the dual scarcity of ML expertise and payment domain knowledge. Montreal's AI ecosystem means Nuvei competes for ML talent against Google, Meta, Samsung, and a constellation of AI startups, while the payment-specific ML requirements mean only a subset of ML engineers have the domain expertise to build production fraud detection systems at Nuvei's scale. Options vest over four years under Advent's PE structure, with significant upside for ML engineers whose models demonstrably improve fraud detection and transaction approval rates.

### Advent PE — The Electronic Currency Issuer Premium

**1. The Fraud Detection Revenue Impact Lever**
> "ML-powered fraud detection at Nuvei directly impacts the bottom line — every false positive is a lost transaction, and every missed fraud case is a chargeback cost. Across 200+ markets, improving model precision by 0.5% can save Nuvei tens of millions annually. Advent International's $6.3 billion investment thesis depends on optimizing these metrics. My ask of $220,000 base reflects the direct P&L impact of ML engineering in payment fraud detection."

**2. The Pay2All ML Model Expansion Lever**
> "The Pay2All Brazil acquisition introduces transaction patterns and fraud vectors that Nuvei's current ML models haven't been trained on. I can build transfer learning models that incorporate Brazilian payment behavior into the global fraud detection system while maintaining precision across existing markets. I'd like my options increased to $95,000/year to reflect the model expansion value I'll deliver for the Pay2All integration."

**3. The Electronic Currency Issuer Anomaly Detection Lever**
> "Nuvei's Electronic Currency Issuer platform requires sophisticated anomaly detection models that can identify suspicious currency issuance patterns, monitor e-money license compliance signals, and flag regulatory risk across 200+ markets in real time. Building ML systems that operate at this intersection of financial intelligence and regulatory compliance is a specialized discipline. My total comp target of $360,000 reflects this domain premium."

**4. The i-Gaming Real-Time Risk Scoring Lever**
> "Nuvei's i-Gaming vertical requires ML models that score transaction risk in sub-second timeframes while maintaining compliance with gaming regulator requirements — including responsible gaming detection, unusual betting pattern identification, and multi-jurisdictional risk assessment. ML engineers who can build production gaming risk models at this latency and accuracy are extremely scarce. I'd like a $22,000 signing bonus and access to Nuvei's GPU compute budget for model experimentation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $230,000 base (New York) with $95,000/year options and 17% target bonus. Your realistic landing zone is $205,000-$220,000 base with $72,000-$88,000 options. Accept-at floor: $185,000 base with $58,000 options and a $20,000 signing bonus. Anchor on quantifiable model impact — bring examples of fraud model improvements with dollar values and show the ROI of ML engineering investment. Remind Advent that Montreal's AI talent market is fiercely competitive, and Nuvei must offer ML compensation that competes with Google Brain Montreal and MILA-adjacent startups. A 15% premium on the Electronic Currency Issuer fraud detection team is cheap insurance against losing to competitors.
