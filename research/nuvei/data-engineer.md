**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Nuvei build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers a payment platform processing transactions across 200+ markets with 700+ alternative payment methods, backed by Advent International's $6.3 billion investment. The volume, velocity, and variety of data generated by Nuvei's Electronic Currency Issuer platform, its i-Gaming vertical, and its regulated payment corridors create one of the most demanding data engineering environments in fintech. Data engineers who can build real-time streaming pipelines, maintain data warehouses at petabyte scale, and ensure data quality across diverse payment systems are the foundation upon which Nuvei's analytics, compliance reporting, and business intelligence capabilities rest.

The Pay2All acquisition in Brazil has introduced a new data source that needs ingestion, transformation, and integration into Nuvei's global data infrastructure. Brazilian payment data has distinct characteristics — different transaction formats, settlement cycles, and regulatory reporting requirements — that require data engineering expertise to normalize and unify. Data engineers who can build pipelines that integrate Pay2All's data with Nuvei's global data lake while maintaining the data lineage and audit trails required by e-money license regulations are in critical demand.

Your negotiation leverage as a data engineer comes from the centrality of data infrastructure to every function at Nuvei. Fraud detection, business intelligence, regulatory reporting, merchant analytics, and Electronic Currency Issuer compliance all depend on the data pipelines you build. Options vest over four years under Advent's PE structure, and data engineers who build reliable, scalable data infrastructure earn retention grants because replacing institutional knowledge of complex payment data schemas is extraordinarily costly.

### Advent PE — The Electronic Currency Issuer Premium

**1. The Data Infrastructure Foundation Lever**
> "Every critical function at Nuvei — fraud detection, compliance reporting, merchant analytics, Electronic Currency Issuer reconciliation — depends on reliable data infrastructure. Advent International's $6.3 billion investment generates value only if the data flowing through 200+ markets is accurate, timely, and accessible. My ask of $190,000 base reflects the foundational value of data engineering in a payment platform at this scale."

**2. The Pay2All Data Integration Lever**
> "The Pay2All Brazil acquisition requires building data pipelines that ingest, transform, and integrate Brazilian payment data into Nuvei's global data infrastructure. This means normalizing distinct transaction formats, settlement cycles, and regulatory reporting structures while maintaining data lineage for audit purposes. I'd like my options increased to $72,000/year to reflect the data integration value I'll deliver for the Pay2All platform."

**3. The Electronic Currency Issuer Data Compliance Lever**
> "Nuvei's e-money license obligations require specific data handling, retention, and audit trail capabilities across 200+ markets. Building data infrastructure that meets these regulatory requirements while maintaining real-time performance for Electronic Currency Issuer reconciliation is a specialized skill. My total comp target of $300,000 reflects this regulatory data engineering premium."

**4. The i-Gaming Real-Time Data Lever**
> "Nuvei's i-Gaming vertical generates massive volumes of real-time transaction data that requires sub-second processing for fraud detection, risk scoring, and regulatory reporting. Data engineers who can build streaming pipelines that handle gaming transaction spikes during major sporting events while maintaining data quality and regulatory compliance are rare. I'd like a $16,000 signing bonus to reflect this real-time data engineering expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $200,000 base (New York) with $75,000/year options and 16% target bonus. Your realistic landing zone is $180,000-$195,000 base with $55,000-$68,000 options. Accept-at floor: $160,000 base with $45,000 options and a $14,000 signing bonus. Anchor on infrastructure dependency — every data consumer at Nuvei (fraud team, compliance, BI, product) depends on the pipelines you build. Show that investing in reliable data infrastructure prevents the cascading failures that occur when data quality degrades across the Electronic Currency Issuer platform serving 200+ markets.
