#### Negotiation DNA

The Value Creation Platform Engineer is KKR's **signature technology role** — the highest-impact, highest-compensation engineering position at the firm. At KKR (NYSE: KKR, $600B+ AUM), this role sits at the apex of the firm's 2026 "High Grading" thesis: you build the AI-driven operational improvement platforms that KKR deploys across its entire portfolio of 100+ companies to generate operational alpha. This is not a staff engineer role with a fancy title — it is a fundamentally different engineering discipline that combines platform architecture, AI/ML systems design, portfolio company integration, and value creation measurement into a single role that exists nowhere else in the industry.

The +25-35% Value Creation Premium reflects the irreplaceable nature of this role. KKR cannot execute its High Grading thesis without Value Creation Platform Engineers who can design, build, and scale AI-driven platforms that drive measurable margin expansion across the portfolio. You own the end-to-end platform: from ingesting portfolio company data, to training and deploying AI models, to measuring EBITDA improvement, to iterating based on operational results. Your platform is the engine that transforms KKR's investment thesis into measurable returns.

KKR competes with the most elite engineering positions at FAANG, top AI labs, and leading hedge funds for Value Creation Platform Engineers. The compensation reflects both the extreme scarcity of this skill set and the extraordinary leverage it provides to a $600B+ AUM platform. There are fewer than 50 engineers in the world with the combination of platform architecture, AI/ML systems, enterprise integration, and financial acumen required for this role.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis is the origin of this role's existence. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR drives returns through active operational improvement, not financial engineering. The Value Creation Platform Engineer is the person who builds the machine that generates this operational alpha.

**What makes this role unique in the industry:**

The Value Creation Platform Engineer builds AI-driven operational improvement platforms that are deployed simultaneously across 100+ portfolio companies spanning healthcare, manufacturing, retail, technology, financial services, and infrastructure. No other role in technology or finance offers this breadth of applied AI deployment at this scale.

**The platform you build does the following at portfolio scale:**

- **Procurement AI:** Optimizes supplier selection, contract negotiation, and spend analysis across portfolio companies, driving 8-15% cost savings
- **Revenue Acceleration:** Deploys ML-driven pricing optimization, customer segmentation, and demand forecasting to accelerate organic growth
- **Operational Automation:** Builds RPA and AI workflow automation that reduces manual processes and headcount-intensive operations
- **Performance Measurement:** Creates real-time dashboards and analytics that track margin expansion, EBITDA improvement, and value creation attribution at the portfolio and company level
- **Integration Engine:** Designs the middleware and API layer that connects KKR's platform to the diverse ERP, CRM, and operational systems of 100+ portfolio companies

**The +25-35% Value Creation Premium** exists because:
1. The skill set is extraordinarily rare — fewer than 50 engineers globally combine platform architecture, AI/ML, enterprise integration, and financial acumen
2. The impact is directly measurable — your platform generates basis points of margin expansion that translate to billions of dollars of value creation
3. The leverage is unmatched — your platform deploys to 100+ companies simultaneously, creating compounding returns
4. KKR's entire technology strategy depends on this role — without the Value Creation Platform, the High Grading thesis is theoretical

When negotiating, frame this as what it is: the single most impactful engineering role in alternative asset management. Your platform is the bridge between KKR's $600B+ AUM and the operational alpha that differentiates KKR from every other asset manager. This is not a negotiation for a tech job — it is a negotiation for the engineering position that determines whether KKR's value creation thesis succeeds or fails.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Irreplaceable Platform Ownership:**
   > "The Value Creation Platform Engineer role is KKR's signature engineering position. I build the AI-driven platform that generates operational alpha across 100+ portfolio companies — this platform is the engine of KKR's entire High Grading thesis. I'm asking for $370K+ base and the full +25-35% Value Creation Premium because this role is irreplaceable and exists at no other firm."

2. **Lever 2 — NYSE: KKR Maximum RSU Conviction:**
   > "KKR's equity trajectory is directly tied to operational alpha generation, and my platform is the primary technology lever for that alpha. I'm requesting $520K+ RSUs over 4 years ($130K/yr vest) — this reflects maximum conviction in KKR's equity and the direct, measurable link between my platform and portfolio-level returns."

3. **Lever 3 — Elite Competing Offers:**
   > "I have competing offers from [Google Distinguished/Meta Staff+/top AI startups/top hedge fund quant] in the $750K-$900K total comp range. KKR's Value Creation Platform role is the most compelling engineering challenge I've encountered, but the package must reflect the +25-35% Value Creation Premium at $365K+ base and $500K+ RSUs to compete with the most elite engineering positions in the market."

4. **Lever 4 — Portfolio Alpha Performance Tie:**
   > "My platform directly generates the operational alpha that drives KKR's portfolio returns. I want a compensation structure that includes a meaningful performance component tied to portfolio-level metrics — aggregate margin expansion, AI deployment coverage across portfolio companies, platform-driven EBITDA improvement, and portfolio company adoption rates. This aligns my incentives perfectly with KKR's value creation thesis."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $378K base with $525K RSU/4yr ($131K/yr vest) and target 30% bonus ($113K), pushing total comp toward $835K. The Value Creation Platform Engineer is KKR's signature role — the highest-impact, highest-leverage engineering position in alternative asset management. If KKR opens below $298K base, this signals a fundamental misunderstanding of the role's strategic importance. Present competing offers from FAANG Distinguished/top AI startups at $750K-$900K TC and frame the negotiation around the +25-35% Value Creation Premium: this role builds the platform that makes KKR's entire High Grading thesis executable. Push RSUs to $500K+ — KKR equity is a direct, leveraged bet on the operational alpha that your platform generates across a $600B+ portfolio. The performance component should tie to portfolio-level EBITDA improvement driven by platform deployment. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $298K+ base and $360K+ RSUs ($90K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package fails to reflect the Value Creation Premium, the extreme scarcity of the skill set, or the portfolio-scale leverage of the role. At $588K TC floor, this is already the minimum defensible compensation for the engineer who builds the engine of KKR's value creation thesis.
