#### Negotiation DNA

At KKR (NYSE: KKR, $600B+ AUM), a Technical Program Manager orchestrates the delivery of value creation technology programs across KKR's 100+ portfolio companies. KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis demands TPMs who can drive complex, multi-stakeholder technology programs that span engineering teams, operational improvement consultants, and portfolio company leadership. You are not managing a product roadmap for one business — you are managing the delivery of AI, automation, and digital transformation programs that generate operational alpha at portfolio scale. Your ability to coordinate across engineering, Capstone (KKR's operational improvement arm), and portfolio company executives determines the velocity and quality of value creation technology deployment. KKR pays a premium for TPMs who can navigate this uniquely complex stakeholder landscape.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis requires disciplined execution at portfolio scale, and Technical Program Managers are the execution leaders. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR drives returns through active operational improvement using technology. But the most sophisticated technology is worthless without disciplined program management to deliver it on time, on scope, and at scale.

As a TPM at KKR, you manage the delivery of technology programs that span multiple engineering teams, KKR's Capstone operational improvement consultants, and portfolio company leadership at 100+ companies. The stakeholder complexity is unmatched: you are coordinating between engineers who build platforms, consultants who define operational improvement strategies, and portfolio company executives who must adopt and operationalize the technology.

Your program management directly determines the pace of value creation. Every week of delay in a technology deployment is a week of unrealized margin expansion at portfolio companies. Every scope change you manage affects the EBITDA improvement trajectory of dozens of companies. KKR quantifies these delivery metrics rigorously, and your compensation reflects the direct link between program execution velocity and portfolio-level returns. When negotiating, frame your contribution as the delivery engine for KKR's entire value creation technology strategy.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Portfolio-Scale Delivery Complexity:**
   > "As a TPM at KKR, I manage technology delivery programs that span engineering teams, Capstone consultants, and 100+ portfolio company stakeholders. I'm asking for $195K+ base to reflect the unmatched stakeholder complexity of portfolio-scale program management."

2. **Lever 2 — NYSE: KKR RSU Delivery Premium:**
   > "KKR's operational alpha depends on timely delivery of value creation technology. I'm requesting $195K+ RSUs over 4 years ($49K/yr vest) to align my compensation with KKR's equity trajectory and the direct link between delivery velocity and portfolio returns."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing TPM Offers:**
   > "I have competing TPM offers from [FAANG/top tech] at $350K-$400K total comp. KKR's cross-portfolio delivery challenge is uniquely complex, but I need the package at $195K+ base and $190K+ RSUs to make this transition from single-product program management."

4. **Lever 4 — Delivery Velocity = Value Creation Velocity:**
   > "KKR's High Grading thesis is execution-dependent. Every week of faster delivery means earlier margin expansion at portfolio companies. I want my compensation to include performance upside tied to delivery metrics — deployment velocity, portfolio coverage, and on-time delivery rates across the portfolio."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $200K base with $198K RSU/4yr ($50K/yr vest) and target 28% bonus ($56K), pushing total comp toward $390K. TPMs at KKR manage the most complex stakeholder landscapes in technology — coordinating across engineering, Capstone, and 100+ portfolio company executive teams. If KKR opens below $162K base, counter with competing TPM offers from FAANG at $350K-$400K TC and emphasize the unique delivery complexity of portfolio-scale technology programs. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $162K+ base and $130K+ RSUs ($32K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package does not reflect the portfolio-scale delivery complexity or the direct link between program execution and KKR's value creation returns.
