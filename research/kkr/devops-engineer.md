#### Negotiation DNA

At KKR (NYSE: KKR, $600B+ AUM), a DevOps Engineer is the infrastructure backbone of KKR's value creation technology deployment. KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis demands DevOps Engineers who can build, deploy, and operate scalable infrastructure that serves not one company, but 100+ portfolio companies simultaneously. You own the CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, monitoring, and deployment automation that enables KKR's operational improvement teams to rapidly deploy AI, automation, and digital transformation tools across the portfolio. Your infrastructure decisions directly determine the speed and reliability of value creation technology deployment. A platform that cannot scale across the portfolio cannot generate operational alpha — your reliability engineering is the foundation on which KKR's entire technology-driven value creation strategy rests.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis depends on infrastructure that scales across the entire portfolio. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR drives returns through active operational improvement using technology. But technology cannot drive operational improvement if the infrastructure beneath it cannot scale, deploy rapidly, and operate reliably across 100+ diverse portfolio companies.

As a DevOps Engineer at KKR, you build the deployment and infrastructure layer that makes portfolio-scale technology deployment possible. Every AI model, every automation workflow, every digital transformation tool that KKR's operational improvement teams deploy depends on the infrastructure you architect and operate. When KKR rolls out a procurement optimization AI to 50 portfolio companies simultaneously, your CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and deployment automation make it happen.

The DevOps role at KKR is fundamentally different from DevOps at a single-product company. You are not operating infrastructure for one application — you are operating infrastructure for an entire portfolio of companies, each with different technology stacks, security requirements, and operational constraints. This multi-tenant, portfolio-scale infrastructure challenge is uniquely demanding, and KKR compensates accordingly. When negotiating, anchor to the fact that your infrastructure work is the deployment layer for KKR's entire value creation technology stack.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Portfolio-Scale Infrastructure:**
   > "As a DevOps Engineer at KKR, I build and operate the infrastructure that enables technology deployment across 100+ portfolio companies. My infrastructure decisions determine the speed and reliability of KKR's entire value creation technology strategy. I'm asking for $180K+ base to reflect the portfolio-scale scope of this infrastructure role."

2. **Lever 2 — NYSE: KKR RSU Infrastructure Grant:**
   > "KKR's ability to execute its operational alpha thesis depends on reliable, scalable infrastructure. I'm requesting $180K+ RSUs over 4 years ($45K/yr vest) to align my compensation with KKR's equity trajectory and the foundational role infrastructure plays in value creation technology deployment."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing DevOps Offers:**
   > "I have competing DevOps/SRE offers from [FAANG/top tech] at $310K-$370K total comp. KKR's multi-tenant, portfolio-scale infrastructure challenge is uniquely compelling, but I need the package at $182K+ base and $175K+ RSUs to justify this transition."

4. **Lever 4 — Deployment Velocity = Value Creation Velocity:**
   > "KKR's High Grading thesis requires rapid deployment of technology across the portfolio. I want my compensation to reflect the direct link between infrastructure velocity and value creation velocity — every day of faster deployment means earlier margin expansion at portfolio companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $185K base with $185K RSU/4yr ($46K/yr vest) and target 26% bonus ($48K), pushing total comp toward $360K. DevOps Engineers at KKR solve a uniquely challenging multi-tenant infrastructure problem — deploying technology across 100+ companies with different stacks and requirements. If KKR opens below $155K base, counter with competing SRE/DevOps offers from FAANG at $310K-$370K TC and emphasize the portfolio-scale infrastructure complexity that makes this role far more demanding than single-product infrastructure work. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $155K+ base and $120K+ RSUs ($30K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package does not reflect the portfolio-scale infrastructure complexity or the foundational role DevOps plays in KKR's value creation technology deployment.
