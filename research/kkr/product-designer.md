#### Negotiation DNA

At KKR (NYSE: KKR, $600B+ AUM), a Product Designer is responsible for designing the interfaces and experiences that make KKR's value creation technology platforms usable, adoptable, and effective across 100+ portfolio companies. KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis demands that technology-driven operational improvement tools are not just built — they must be adopted at scale. Your design work directly determines adoption rates, time-to-value, and the effectiveness of AI and automation tools that drive margin expansion. Poor UX means poor adoption, which means unrealized value creation potential. KKR understands that design quality is an adoption multiplier, and compensates Product Designers at a premium to traditional finance roles because design directly influences the pace and scale of operational alpha generation across the portfolio.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis positions Product Design as a critical adoption lever for operational alpha. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR drives returns through active operational improvement, embedding AI and automation into portfolio companies. But technology that is not adopted creates zero value.

As a Product Designer at KKR, you solve the adoption problem. Your design decisions determine whether portfolio company operators — from C-suite executives to frontline managers — actually use the AI-driven platforms that KKR's engineering teams build. The difference between 30% adoption and 90% adoption of a procurement AI tool can mean hundreds of basis points of margin expansion across the portfolio.

KKR's operational improvement teams have learned that design quality is the strongest predictor of technology adoption in portfolio companies. You are not designing consumer apps for engagement — you are designing enterprise operational tools that must be intuitive enough for non-technical operators to use immediately. This is a uniquely challenging design problem, and KKR compensates for it. When negotiating, anchor to the fact that your design work is an adoption multiplier — without excellent UX, KKR's entire technology-driven value creation thesis stalls.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Adoption Multiplier:**
   > "As a Product Designer at KKR, my work directly determines the adoption rate of value creation technology across 100+ portfolio companies. Design quality is the strongest predictor of technology adoption — I'm asking for compensation that reflects my role as the adoption multiplier for KKR's operational alpha thesis."

2. **Lever 2 — NYSE: KKR RSU Grant:**
   > "KKR's equity performance is driven by operational alpha, and adoption of value creation technology is critical to that alpha. I'm requesting $150K+ RSUs over 4 years to align my compensation with KKR's trajectory and the direct impact of design quality on portfolio technology adoption."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Design Offers:**
   > "I have competing Product Designer offers from [FAANG/top fintech] at $280K-$330K total comp. KKR's design challenge — making AI-driven operational tools usable for non-technical portfolio company operators — is uniquely compelling, but I need the package at $160K+ base and $145K+ RSUs to make this move."

4. **Lever 4 — Portfolio-Scale Design System:**
   > "KKR's High Grading thesis requires a scalable design system that works across diverse portfolio companies. I want my compensation to reflect the strategic value of building a design system that accelerates adoption and drives margin expansion at portfolio scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $165K base with $155K RSU/4yr ($39K/yr vest) and target 26% bonus ($43K), pushing total comp toward $315K. Product Designers at KKR are adoption strategists — without excellent design, the value creation technology platforms fail to generate returns. If KKR opens below $135K base, counter with competing offers from FAANG/top tech at $280K-$330K TC and emphasize the unique challenge of designing operational tools for non-technical users across diverse portfolio companies. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $135K+ base and $100K+ RSUs ($25K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package undervalues the design function's role as the adoption multiplier for KKR's entire operational alpha technology strategy.
