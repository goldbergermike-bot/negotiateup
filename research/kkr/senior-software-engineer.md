#### Negotiation DNA

At KKR (NYSE: KKR, $600B+ AUM), a Senior Software Engineer is a critical value creation asset, not a mid-level individual contributor. KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis demands that senior engineers drive operational alpha — architecting systems that embed AI and automation directly into portfolio company operations. You own technical decisions that cascade across KKR's entire technology platform and are deployed to 100+ portfolio companies. Your architectural choices directly influence margin expansion at portfolio scale. KKR pays a significant premium over traditional finance because senior engineers are expected to operate at the intersection of technology leadership and investment value creation. At this level, you are a force multiplier for KKR's operational improvement teams, and your compensation should reflect the outsized leverage your work provides to the firm's value creation playbook.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis is the defining framework for understanding why Senior Software Engineer compensation at KKR commands a premium. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR generates returns through active operational improvement of portfolio companies, deploying technology, AI, and automation at scale rather than relying on financial engineering alone.

As a Senior Software Engineer, you are a principal architect of the High Grading infrastructure. You design the systems that KKR's operational improvement teams use to embed AI-driven automation into portfolio companies. Your platform decisions determine whether a portfolio company achieves 200bps or 500bps of margin expansion. KKR's Capstone team — the operational improvement arm — depends on the platforms you build to deliver measurable EBITDA improvement across the portfolio.

This positions Senior Software Engineers at the nexus of technology and value creation. Unlike a senior engineer at a single-product tech company, your work at KKR compounds across 100+ companies. KKR quantifies this compounding effect, and your compensation should reflect it. When negotiating, anchor to the fact that KKR's operational alpha thesis depends on engineering leadership at this level — you are not filling a seat, you are building the engine of value creation.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Architectural Leverage:**
   > "As a Senior Software Engineer, my architectural decisions propagate across KKR's entire portfolio technology platform. I'm asking for compensation that reflects the outsized leverage of my work — every system I design is deployed to 100+ portfolio companies, driving margin expansion at scale."

2. **Lever 2 — RSU Growth Trajectory on NYSE: KKR:**
   > "KKR's public equity has delivered consistent shareholder returns driven by the operational alpha thesis. I'd like an RSU grant of $300K+ over 4 years to align my compensation with KKR's equity trajectory and the direct role my engineering output plays in portfolio value creation."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Senior IC Offers:**
   > "I have competing offers at the senior/staff level from [FAANG/top fintech] ranging from $420K-$520K total comp. KKR's mission to embed technology across its portfolio is uniquely compelling, but I need the package at $230K+ base and $280K+ RSUs to make this transition."

4. **Lever 4 — High Grading Ownership:**
   > "KKR's High Grading thesis depends on senior engineers who can translate operational improvement strategies into scalable technology platforms. I want my compensation to include a performance component tied to measurable portfolio impact — margin expansion, automation deployment, and AI adoption metrics across portfolio companies."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $235K base with $300K RSU/4yr ($75K/yr vest) and target 28% bonus ($66K), pushing total comp toward $520K. If KKR opens below $195K base, counter with documented competing offers from FAANG at $450K-$520K TC and frame the conversation around KKR's need for architectural leadership in its High Grading thesis. Push RSUs hard — KKR equity is a direct play on AUM growth and operational alpha across the portfolio. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $195K+ base and $200K+ RSUs ($50K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package undervalues senior engineering leadership at a $600B+ AUM platform where code deploys across 100+ companies.
