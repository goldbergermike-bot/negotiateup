#### Negotiation DNA

At KKR (NYSE: KKR, $600B+ AUM), a Data Engineer builds the data infrastructure that powers KKR's entire technology-driven value creation thesis. KKR's 2026 "High Grading" approach requires Data Engineers who can design, build, and operate data pipelines that ingest, transform, and deliver data from 100+ portfolio companies into the analytics and AI platforms that drive operational alpha. You are not building data pipelines for one product — you are building the data fabric that connects KKR's entire portfolio, enabling real-time visibility into portfolio company performance and fueling the AI models that identify margin expansion opportunities. Your data engineering decisions determine the quality, speed, and reliability of data that informs billion-dollar investment decisions and operational improvement strategies.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis is powered by data, and Data Engineers build the systems that make that data accessible, reliable, and actionable. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR drives returns through active operational improvement using technology and AI. But AI models are only as good as the data they consume, and the data infrastructure that feeds them determines the quality of every operational improvement insight.

As a Data Engineer at KKR, you build the portfolio-scale data fabric that connects 100+ companies with different data formats, systems, and quality standards into a unified analytical layer. Your data pipelines ingest financial performance data, operational metrics, supply chain information, and customer analytics from diverse portfolio company systems and transform them into the structured, reliable datasets that power KKR's AI-driven value creation platforms.

The High Grading premium for Data Engineers reflects the foundational nature of this work. Without robust data engineering, KKR's data scientists cannot build models, KKR's AI engineers cannot train systems, and KKR's operational improvement teams cannot measure margin expansion. You are the foundation of the entire value creation data stack. When negotiating, anchor to this foundational positioning — every other technology function at KKR depends on the data infrastructure you build and maintain.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Portfolio Data Fabric Ownership:**
   > "As a Data Engineer at KKR, I build and maintain the data infrastructure that connects 100+ portfolio companies into a unified analytical platform. Every AI model, every analytics insight, and every operational improvement measurement depends on my data pipelines. I'm asking for $205K+ base to reflect this foundational role."

2. **Lever 2 — NYSE: KKR RSU Data Infrastructure Grant:**
   > "KKR's AI-driven value creation strategy depends entirely on reliable data infrastructure. I'm requesting $205K+ RSUs over 4 years ($51K/yr vest) to align my compensation with KKR's equity trajectory and the foundational role data engineering plays in operational alpha generation."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Data Engineering Offers:**
   > "I have competing Data Engineer offers from [FAANG/top tech] at $365K-$420K total comp. KKR's portfolio-scale data engineering challenge — integrating data from 100+ companies with diverse systems — is uniquely complex, but I need the package at $205K+ base and $200K+ RSUs to be competitive."

4. **Lever 4 — Data Quality = AI Quality = Alpha Quality:**
   > "KKR's High Grading thesis runs on data. Bad data means bad AI models, which means missed margin expansion opportunities across the portfolio. I want my compensation to reflect the direct chain from data quality to operational alpha — my data engineering work determines the accuracy of every value creation insight."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $210K base with $208K RSU/4yr ($52K/yr vest) and target 27% bonus ($57K), pushing total comp toward $405K. Data Engineers at KKR are the foundation of the entire value creation technology stack — without reliable data pipelines, AI models and analytics platforms produce nothing. If KKR opens below $172K base, counter with competing offers from FAANG at $365K-$420K TC and emphasize the unique complexity of building data infrastructure that integrates 100+ portfolio companies with different systems, formats, and quality standards. Push RSUs to $190K+ — your data infrastructure directly enables the AI-driven operational alpha that drives KKR's equity performance. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $172K+ base and $135K+ RSUs ($34K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package undervalues the foundational role data engineering plays in KKR's entire technology-driven value creation strategy.
