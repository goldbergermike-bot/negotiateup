#### Negotiation DNA

At KKR (NYSE: KKR, $600B+ AUM), a Product Manager operates at the intersection of technology strategy and investment value creation. KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis demands Product Managers who define and prioritize technology platforms that generate operational alpha — measurable margin expansion across 100+ portfolio companies. You are not building consumer products for engagement metrics; you are defining the product vision for AI-driven operational improvement tools that KKR deploys at portfolio scale. Your product decisions determine which automation, AI, and digital transformation capabilities reach portfolio companies and how effectively they drive EBITDA improvement. KKR values Product Managers who think like investors — every feature you prioritize must have a measurable return on portfolio performance. This investment-minded product leadership commands a premium over traditional PM compensation.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis transforms the Product Manager role from feature prioritization to value creation strategy. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR drives returns through active operational improvement of portfolio companies using technology, not through financial engineering alone.

As a Product Manager, you are the strategic decision-maker who determines which technology capabilities KKR's operational improvement teams deploy across the portfolio. Your product roadmap is a value creation roadmap. When you prioritize an AI-driven procurement optimization feature, you are making an investment decision that affects margin expansion at dozens of companies. When you define the MVP for a revenue acceleration platform, you are setting the parameters for portfolio-wide EBITDA improvement.

KKR's Capstone operational improvement teams depend on Product Managers who understand both technology and investment returns. You must speak the language of basis points and EBITDA improvement as fluently as you speak the language of user stories and sprint planning. This dual fluency is rare, and KKR compensates accordingly. When negotiating, anchor to the fact that your product decisions generate measurable portfolio returns — you are not a PM who serves users, you are a PM who drives investor returns.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Portfolio Product Strategy:**
   > "As a Product Manager at KKR, my product roadmap decisions directly determine which value creation capabilities reach 100+ portfolio companies. I'm asking for compensation that reflects the investment impact of my product strategy — every feature I prioritize is a margin expansion lever at portfolio scale."

2. **Lever 2 — NYSE: KKR RSU Alignment:**
   > "KKR's public equity performance is driven by operational alpha — the exact thesis my product work enables. I'm requesting $230K+ RSUs over 4 years to align my compensation with KKR's equity trajectory and the direct link between my product decisions and portfolio value creation."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing PM Offers:**
   > "I have competing PM offers from [FAANG/top fintech] at $380K-$440K total comp. KKR's value creation product thesis is uniquely compelling, but I need the package at $205K+ base and $220K+ RSUs to justify the move from consumer/enterprise product to alternative asset management."

4. **Lever 4 — Investment-Minded Product Leadership:**
   > "KKR's High Grading thesis requires Product Managers who think like investors. My product decisions generate measurable portfolio returns, and I want a compensation structure that includes performance-based upside tied to the operational impact of the products I define and deliver."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $210K base with $230K RSU/4yr ($58K/yr vest) and target 28% bonus ($59K), pushing total comp toward $430K. Product Managers at KKR are not traditional PMs — they are value creation strategists who determine which technology capabilities drive margin expansion across a $600B+ portfolio. If KKR opens below $170K base, present competing offers from FAANG at $380K-$440K TC and emphasize the unique dual fluency (product + investment) required for this role. Push RSUs to $200K+ given KKR's strong equity trajectory. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $170K+ base and $155K+ RSUs ($39K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package does not reflect the investment impact of product leadership at portfolio scale.
