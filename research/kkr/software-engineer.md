#### Negotiation DNA

KKR (NYSE: KKR) is not a typical financial services employer for software engineers. With $600B+ in assets under management, KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis demands that every technology hire contributes to operational alpha — measurable improvements in portfolio company performance driven by technology, not financial engineering alone. As a Software Engineer at KKR, you are building and maintaining the platforms, tools, and systems that power KKR's value creation playbook across 100+ portfolio companies. Your code directly impacts margin expansion, digital transformation, and AI deployment at scale. The firm pays at or above top-tier tech company rates because every engineering output is measured against portfolio-level EBITDA improvement. Negotiate from the position that your work generates returns across an entire portfolio, not just a single product line.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis redefines the role of a Software Engineer in alternative asset management. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR drives returns through active operational improvement, embedding technology and AI into portfolio companies to expand margins, not by relying on market tailwinds or financial leverage alone.

As a Software Engineer, your contribution to High Grading is direct: you build the foundational systems that KKR's operational improvement teams deploy across 100+ portfolio companies. Every microservice, every data pipeline, every automation workflow you ship is a lever for margin expansion at portfolio scale. KKR quantifies this impact rigorously — your code is measured in basis points of portfolio return, not just sprint velocity.

This creates a compensation premium. KKR must compete with FAANG and top-tier fintech for engineering talent, but offers something those firms cannot: the ability to see your code generate measurable value creation across dozens of companies simultaneously. When negotiating, anchor to this multiplier effect — your output at KKR has a broader blast radius than at any single-product company.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Portfolio Impact Multiplier:**
   > "My engineering work at KKR doesn't serve a single product — it deploys across 100+ portfolio companies. I'd like my compensation to reflect the multiplied impact of my contributions to KKR's value creation platform, which directly drives EBITDA improvement at scale."

2. **Lever 2 — RSU Upside on NYSE: KKR:**
   > "KKR is publicly traded and has delivered strong shareholder returns. I'm asking for an RSU grant that reflects both my confidence in KKR's equity trajectory and the direct link between my engineering output and the firm's operational alpha thesis."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Calibration:**
   > "I'm evaluating offers from [FAANG/top fintech] at $X total comp. KKR's value creation mission is compelling, but I need the package to be competitive at $Y base and $Z RSUs to make the move to alternative assets."

4. **Lever 4 — High Grading Alignment:**
   > "KKR's High Grading thesis is about driving operational improvement through technology. I want my comp structure to include performance-based upside tied to the measurable portfolio impact of the platforms I build — this aligns my incentives with KKR's value creation goals."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $175K base with $180K RSU/4yr ($45K/yr vest) and target 25% bonus ($44K), pushing total comp toward $355K. If KKR counters below $155K base, cite competing offers from top-tier tech firms at $280K-$320K TC and emphasize the portfolio multiplier effect. Use the RSU lever aggressively — KKR equity has strong upside tied to AUM growth and operational alpha. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $155K+ base and $140K+ RSUs ($35K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package does not reflect market rate for engineers whose code deploys across a $600B+ AUM platform.
