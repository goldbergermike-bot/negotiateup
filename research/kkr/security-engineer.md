#### Negotiation DNA

At KKR (NYSE: KKR, $600B+ AUM), a Security Engineer protects the technology infrastructure and data assets that underpin KKR's entire value creation thesis. KKR's 2026 "High Grading" approach demands Security Engineers who understand that cybersecurity at an alternative asset manager is not just about protecting one company — it is about protecting a $600B+ portfolio of 100+ companies connected through shared technology platforms. A security breach at the platform level does not affect one business; it affects the entire portfolio. Your security architecture, threat detection, and incident response capabilities directly protect KKR's reputation, regulatory standing, and the integrity of the technology-driven operational improvement tools deployed across the portfolio. KKR compensates Security Engineers at a premium because the blast radius of a security failure at portfolio scale is orders of magnitude larger than at a single-product company.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis creates a unique and elevated role for Security Engineers. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR drives returns through active operational improvement, deploying technology, AI, and automation across 100+ portfolio companies. But every technology deployment expands the attack surface, and every portfolio company connection creates a potential lateral movement path.

As a Security Engineer at KKR, you are the guardian of the value creation platform. Your security architecture determines whether KKR can safely deploy AI and automation tools at portfolio scale without creating unacceptable cyber risk. You design the zero-trust architectures, implement the security controls, and build the threat detection systems that allow KKR's operational improvement teams to move fast without compromising the security of the portfolio.

The value creation premium for Security Engineers reflects the asymmetric risk profile of portfolio-scale security. A security incident at KKR does not just affect one company — it can cascade across 100+ portfolio companies, affecting billions of dollars in enterprise value. KKR understands this asymmetry and compensates Security Engineers who can design and implement security architectures that enable aggressive technology deployment while maintaining portfolio-grade protection. When negotiating, anchor to the portfolio-scale blast radius — your security work protects $600B+ in AUM.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Portfolio-Scale Security Responsibility:**
   > "As a Security Engineer at KKR, I protect the technology infrastructure connecting 100+ portfolio companies and $600B+ in AUM. The blast radius of a security failure at this scale is catastrophic. I'm asking for $205K+ base to reflect the portfolio-scale security responsibility."

2. **Lever 2 — NYSE: KKR RSU Risk Premium:**
   > "KKR's ability to deploy value creation technology depends on maintaining robust security across the portfolio. I'm requesting $205K+ RSUs over 4 years ($51K/yr vest) to align my compensation with the critical role security plays in enabling KKR's operational alpha thesis."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Security Offers:**
   > "I have competing Security Engineer offers from [FAANG/top fintech/cybersecurity firms] at $365K-$420K total comp. KKR's portfolio-scale security challenge is differentiated, but I need the package at $205K+ base and $200K+ RSUs to be competitive with top-tier security roles."

4. **Lever 4 — Cyber Risk as Portfolio Risk:**
   > "KKR's High Grading thesis depends on technology deployment, but every deployment expands the attack surface across the portfolio. I want my compensation to reflect the asymmetric risk I manage — my security architecture protects not just KKR, but the enterprise value of 100+ portfolio companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $210K base with $210K RSU/4yr ($52K/yr vest) and target 27% bonus ($57K), pushing total comp toward $405K. Security Engineers at KKR manage portfolio-scale cyber risk — a security failure cascades across 100+ companies and billions in enterprise value. If KKR opens below $172K base, counter with competing offers from FAANG/cybersecurity firms at $365K-$420K TC and emphasize the unique asymmetric risk profile of protecting a $600B+ AUM portfolio. Push RSUs to $190K+ — KKR equity upside is directly protected by your security work. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $172K+ base and $135K+ RSUs ($34K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package does not reflect the portfolio-scale security responsibility or the catastrophic downside risk that Security Engineers at KKR must mitigate.
