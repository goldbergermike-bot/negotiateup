#### Negotiation DNA

At KKR (NYSE: KKR, $600B+ AUM), an Engineering Manager is a value creation leader who builds, scales, and directs the engineering teams responsible for KKR's technology-driven operational improvement thesis. KKR's 2026 "High Grading" approach demands Engineering Managers who do more than ship code on schedule — you must build teams that deliver operational alpha. You own the engineering roadmap for platforms that deploy AI, automation, and digital transformation tools across 100+ portfolio companies. Your hiring decisions, team architecture, and technical strategy directly determine the velocity and quality of KKR's value creation technology deployment. This is not a people management role at a product company; this is a leadership position at the center of KKR's portfolio-wide margin expansion strategy.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis elevates the Engineering Manager role from team leadership to strategic value creation. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR generates returns through active operational improvement, not passive market exposure. Engineering Managers are the operational leaders who translate this thesis into engineering execution.

Your teams build the platforms that KKR's Capstone operational improvement arm deploys across 100+ portfolio companies. The velocity, quality, and scalability of your team's output directly determines the pace of margin expansion across the portfolio. When your team ships a procurement AI tool, it doesn't serve one customer — it serves KKR's entire portfolio. When your team builds a revenue optimization platform, the EBITDA impact compounds across dozens of companies.

As an Engineering Manager, your High Grading contribution is twofold: (1) you build and retain the engineering talent that makes value creation technology possible, and (2) you set the technical direction that determines which operational improvement initiatives are technically feasible. KKR's operational improvement teams depend on your judgment. Your compensation reflects the strategic leverage of both your team's output and your leadership decisions. When negotiating, frame yourself as the person who builds the team that builds the value creation engine — this is the highest-leverage people leadership role in alternative assets.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Team Output Multiplier:**
   > "As an Engineering Manager at KKR, my team's output deploys across 100+ portfolio companies. I build and direct the engineers whose platforms drive margin expansion at portfolio scale. I'm asking for $275K+ base to reflect the outsized leverage of engineering leadership at a $600B+ AUM firm."

2. **Lever 2 — NYSE: KKR RSU Leadership Grant:**
   > "Engineering Managers at KKR directly influence the firm's ability to execute its operational alpha thesis. I'm requesting a $360K RSU grant over 4 years ($90K/yr vest) — this reflects both the strategic nature of the role and my confidence in KKR's equity trajectory driven by value creation technology."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Management Offers:**
   > "I have competing EM offers from [FAANG/top-tier tech] at $520K-$620K total comp. KKR's mission to drive operational alpha through technology is compelling, but I need the package at $270K+ base and $340K+ RSUs to make the transition from pure tech to alternative asset management."

4. **Lever 4 — Talent Retention & Team Building Premium:**
   > "KKR's High Grading thesis depends on retaining top engineering talent in a competitive market. As the leader responsible for hiring, retaining, and directing this talent, my compensation should reflect the strategic importance of engineering team building to KKR's value creation capabilities."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $280K base with $360K RSU/4yr ($90K/yr vest) and target 28% bonus ($78K), pushing total comp toward $620K. Engineering Managers at KKR are not fungible — they build the teams that build the value creation platform. If KKR opens below $230K base, counter with competing EM offers from FAANG at $520K-$620K TC and emphasize the unique challenge of building engineering teams that serve a portfolio-scale operational improvement thesis. RSUs are critical — push for $300K+ given KKR's strong equity trajectory. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $230K+ base and $240K+ RSUs ($60K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package undervalues engineering leadership at a firm where team output compounds across 100+ portfolio companies.
