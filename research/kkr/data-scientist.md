#### Negotiation DNA

At KKR (NYSE: KKR, $600B+ AUM), a Data Scientist is a value creation analyst whose models and insights directly drive investment decisions and portfolio company performance improvement. KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis demands Data Scientists who generate operational alpha from data — building predictive models, analytics platforms, and AI systems that identify and quantify margin expansion opportunities across 100+ portfolio companies. You are not analyzing data for dashboards; you are building the analytical foundation of KKR's entire operational improvement playbook. Your models inform where KKR deploys technology, which portfolio companies receive AI-driven transformation, and how margin expansion is measured and attributed. This direct line from your models to investment returns positions Data Scientists at KKR as integral to the firm's value creation engine.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis is fundamentally a data-driven thesis, and Data Scientists are its analytical architects. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR drives returns through active operational improvement, and data science is the discipline that identifies, quantifies, and tracks the operational improvement opportunities.

As a Data Scientist at KKR, your models answer the most consequential questions in the portfolio: Which companies have the highest margin expansion potential? Where should AI and automation be deployed first? What is the expected EBITDA improvement from a specific technology intervention? How do we measure and attribute value creation at portfolio scale?

KKR's Capstone operational improvement teams rely on Data Scientists to provide the analytical backbone for every technology deployment across 100+ portfolio companies. Your predictive models determine resource allocation decisions worth billions of dollars. Your analytics platforms track the real-time performance of operational improvement initiatives across the portfolio. This is not data science for product optimization — this is data science for investment returns.

The value creation premium for Data Scientists at KKR reflects this direct connection between analytical output and portfolio performance. When negotiating, frame your contribution in terms of the investment decisions your models inform and the basis points of margin expansion your analytics identify and track.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Portfolio Analytics Impact:**
   > "As a Data Scientist at KKR, my models directly inform investment decisions and operational improvement resource allocation across 100+ portfolio companies. I'm asking for $225K+ base to reflect the investment-grade impact of my analytical work on KKR's value creation strategy."

2. **Lever 2 — NYSE: KKR RSU Data Alpha:**
   > "My analytical models identify and quantify the operational alpha opportunities that drive KKR's equity performance. I'm requesting $270K+ RSUs over 4 years ($68K/yr vest) to align my compensation with the direct link between my data science output and KKR's portfolio returns."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Data Science Offers:**
   > "I have competing Data Scientist offers from [FAANG/top quant firms] at $420K-$490K total comp. KKR's data science challenge — quantifying and tracking operational alpha across an entire portfolio — is differentiated, but I need the package at $220K+ base and $260K+ RSUs to be competitive."

4. **Lever 4 — Operational Alpha Quantification:**
   > "KKR's High Grading thesis depends on Data Scientists who can quantify margin expansion opportunities and measure the ROI of technology deployments across portfolio companies. I want performance-based upside tied to the measurable impact of my models on portfolio company EBITDA improvement."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $228K base with $268K RSU/4yr ($67K/yr vest) and target 29% bonus ($66K), pushing total comp toward $480K. Data Scientists at KKR directly inform billion-dollar resource allocation decisions and track portfolio-wide operational alpha. If KKR opens below $185K base, counter with competing offers from FAANG/quant firms at $420K-$490K TC and emphasize the unique challenge of building portfolio-scale analytics that inform investment-level decisions. Push RSUs to $240K+ — KKR equity is a direct play on the operational alpha that your models identify and quantify. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $185K+ base and $180K+ RSUs ($45K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package undervalues data science at a firm where analytical output directly drives investment returns across $600B+ AUM.
