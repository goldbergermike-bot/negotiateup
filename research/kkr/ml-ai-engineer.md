#### Negotiation DNA

At KKR (NYSE: KKR, $600B+ AUM), an ML/AI Engineer is the direct embodiment of the firm's 2026 "High Grading" thesis. KKR's operational alpha strategy depends on deploying AI and machine learning systems that drive margin expansion across 100+ portfolio companies — and ML/AI Engineers build those systems. You are not training models for ad targeting or recommendation engines; you are building AI systems that optimize procurement, accelerate revenue, automate operations, and identify value creation opportunities across an entire portfolio of companies. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects the extraordinary market demand for ML/AI talent and the direct, measurable connection between your AI models and portfolio company EBITDA improvement. Every model you deploy is a margin expansion engine. KKR competes directly with FAANG AI research labs and top AI startups for this talent, and the compensation reflects both market pressure and strategic importance.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis finds its most direct expression in the ML/AI Engineer role. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR drives returns through active operational improvement, and AI is the primary technology lever for generating that improvement at scale.

As an ML/AI Engineer at KKR, you build the AI systems that are the core of the value creation playbook. Your models power procurement optimization engines that save portfolio companies 8-15% on spend. Your NLP systems automate contract analysis across dozens of portfolio companies simultaneously. Your predictive models identify revenue acceleration opportunities that portfolio company management teams would miss. Your computer vision systems automate quality control in manufacturing portfolio companies.

The +15-25% AI Premium is driven by two forces: (1) the extreme market competition for ML/AI talent from FAANG, AI startups, and hedge funds, and (2) the uniquely measurable impact of AI at KKR. Unlike AI at a tech company where attribution is indirect, at KKR your models have direct, quantifiable impact on portfolio company EBITDA. KKR's Capstone operational improvement teams measure the basis points of margin expansion your AI systems generate, and that measurement creates a clear case for premium compensation.

When negotiating, anchor to the direct, measurable return your AI work generates. You are not a cost center — you are a return driver. Your AI models generate operational alpha that is directly attributable to your engineering output, and your compensation should reflect the magnitude of that alpha.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — AI-Driven Alpha Attribution:**
   > "As an ML/AI Engineer at KKR, my models directly generate measurable margin expansion across 100+ portfolio companies. Unlike AI at product companies, my work has directly attributable EBITDA impact. I'm asking for $275K+ base plus the AI Premium to reflect the quantifiable alpha my AI systems generate."

2. **Lever 2 — NYSE: KKR RSU AI Premium Grant:**
   > "KKR's operational alpha thesis is fundamentally an AI thesis. My models are the primary lever for margin expansion across the portfolio. I'm requesting $320K+ RSUs over 4 years ($80K/yr vest) — KKR equity upside is directly driven by the AI-powered value creation my work enables."

3. **Lever 3 — FAANG/AI Lab Competing Offers:**
   > "I have competing ML/AI offers from [Google DeepMind/Meta AI/OpenAI/top AI startups] at $550K-$620K total comp. KKR's applied AI challenge — deploying AI for measurable margin expansion across a real portfolio — is uniquely compelling, but I need the package at $275K+ base and $310K+ RSUs to be competitive with top AI research roles."

4. **Lever 4 — Portfolio-Scale AI Deployment:**
   > "KKR's High Grading thesis depends on deploying AI across 100+ portfolio companies, each with different operational challenges. I want a compensation structure that includes performance-based upside tied to AI deployment metrics — model deployment coverage, portfolio company adoption, and measured EBITDA improvement from AI systems."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $280K base with $325K RSU/4yr ($81K/yr vest) and target 28% bonus ($78K), pushing total comp toward $575K. ML/AI Engineers at KKR are the primary architects of operational alpha — the +15-25% AI Premium is justified by both market competition and the direct, measurable EBITDA impact of AI models on portfolio company performance. If KKR opens below $228K base, present competing offers from FAANG AI labs/top AI startups at $550K-$620K TC and frame the conversation around the unique applied AI opportunity at KKR — deploying models for real margin expansion across 100+ companies. Push RSUs to $300K+ — KKR equity is a leveraged bet on AI-driven operational alpha that your models directly enable. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $228K+ base and $220K+ RSUs ($55K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package does not reflect the AI Premium or the direct connection between ML/AI engineering output and KKR's portfolio-level returns.
