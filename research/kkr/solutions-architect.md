#### Negotiation DNA

At KKR (NYSE: KKR, $600B+ AUM), a Solutions Architect is the technical strategist who designs end-to-end technology solutions that bridge KKR's value creation platforms with the diverse, complex technology environments of 100+ portfolio companies. KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis demands Solutions Architects who can assess portfolio company technology landscapes, design integration architectures, and ensure that AI-driven operational improvement tools are deployable across heterogeneous enterprise environments. You are not designing solutions for one client — you are designing reusable, adaptable solution architectures that generate operational alpha at portfolio scale. Your ability to navigate complex enterprise technology stacks while maintaining architectural coherence across the portfolio is what enables KKR's technology-driven value creation playbook to function. This cross-portfolio architectural role commands a premium because no other firm offers this breadth of enterprise architecture challenge.

#### High Grading — The Value Creation Premium

KKR's 2026 "High Grading" thesis places Solutions Architects at the critical junction between technology capability and portfolio company reality. High Grading means operational alpha over beta — KKR drives returns through active operational improvement using technology. But technology must be integrated into existing portfolio company environments to generate value, and that integration challenge falls to Solutions Architects.

As a Solutions Architect at KKR, you solve the hardest problem in portfolio-scale technology deployment: making standardized value creation platforms work across 100+ companies with different ERP systems, cloud environments, data architectures, and security requirements. Every portfolio company is a unique integration challenge, and your solution designs determine whether KKR's AI and automation tools actually reach production and generate margin expansion.

KKR's Capstone operational improvement teams depend on Solutions Architects to provide the "last mile" of technology deployment. Without your integration architectures, the most sophisticated AI platforms remain theoretical. Your solution designs are the bridge between engineering capability and operational alpha generation. When negotiating, anchor to the irreplaceable nature of this cross-portfolio integration expertise — KKR cannot execute its High Grading thesis without Solutions Architects who understand both the platform and the diverse environments it must serve.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Cross-Portfolio Integration Expertise:**
   > "As a Solutions Architect at KKR, I design integration architectures that enable value creation technology deployment across 100+ portfolio companies with diverse technology environments. I'm asking for $210K+ base to reflect the unique complexity of portfolio-scale enterprise architecture."

2. **Lever 2 — NYSE: KKR RSU Integration Premium:**
   > "KKR's operational alpha depends on technology actually reaching portfolio company production environments — that's my job. I'm requesting $225K+ RSUs over 4 years ($56K/yr vest) to align my compensation with KKR's equity trajectory and the critical role integration architecture plays in value creation."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Architecture Offers:**
   > "I have competing Solutions Architect offers from [major cloud providers/enterprise tech] at $380K-$440K total comp. KKR's cross-portfolio architecture challenge is the most complex in the industry, and I need the package at $208K+ base and $220K+ RSUs to be competitive."

4. **Lever 4 — Deployment Success = Value Creation:**
   > "KKR's High Grading thesis only generates returns when technology reaches production at portfolio companies. As the Solutions Architect responsible for integration design, I want performance-based upside tied to successful deployment metrics — technology adoption rates, time-to-production, and portfolio company integration coverage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $215K base with $228K RSU/4yr ($57K/yr vest) and target 27% bonus ($58K), pushing total comp toward $430K. Solutions Architects at KKR are the "last mile" of value creation technology deployment — without their integration architectures, AI platforms never reach production at portfolio companies. If KKR opens below $175K base, counter with competing offers from major cloud providers/enterprise tech at $380K-$440K TC and emphasize the unparalleled complexity of designing solutions that work across 100+ heterogeneous enterprise environments. Walk-away floor: **Accept at $175K+ base and $150K+ RSUs ($38K/yr vest)**. Below this, the package undervalues the cross-portfolio integration expertise that makes KKR's entire technology-driven value creation strategy executable.
