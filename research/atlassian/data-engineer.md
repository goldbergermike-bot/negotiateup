### Data Engineer | Atlassian Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy RSU/4yr + No Bonus | Team Anywhere Distributed | AI Orchestra Positioning | Guard Premium + Rovo Rollout Leverage

---

Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM, $4.4B+ ARR) powers collaboration for 300,000+ enterprise customers and 10M+ monthly active users through Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket, Jira Service Management, and Loom. The Data Engineer builds the data infrastructure that powers analytics, AI features, and business intelligence across the entire platform. Since the Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine, Data Engineers are the AI Orchestra's pipeline builders: constructing the data infrastructure that feeds Rovo AI agents and powering the Guard Premium analytics that track governance compliance. The Conductor/Instrument dual role for Data Engineers means building both the data pipelines that make AI agents intelligent (Conductor infrastructure) and the data governance frameworks that make them compliant (Instrument infrastructure). Compensation is no-bonus, RSU-heavy (Atlassian RSUs -- NASDAQ: TEAM).

#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at Atlassian build the data infrastructure backbone -- usage telemetry, product analytics, revenue attribution, cloud migration tracking, and the data pipelines feeding Atlassian Intelligence AI features. The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Guard Premium and Rovo AI transformed the Data Engineer role: you now build the data pipelines that make the AI Orchestra function. The Conductor/Instrument dual role for Data Engineers means building the data infrastructure that feeds Rovo AI agents (training data, feature stores, real-time signals) and the Guard Premium data governance layer (data lineage, access audit trails, compliance reporting). Without the right data infrastructure, neither Rovo agents nor Guard Premium governance can work. Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) represent 40-48% of total comp with no bonus.

#### Level Mapping

| Atlassian Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---|---|---|
| P2 (Data Engineer) | Data Engineer | 2-4 years |
| P3 (Senior DE) | Senior Data Engineer | 4-7 years |
| P4 (Staff DE) | Staff / Lead Data Engineer | 7-10+ years |

**Level Mapping:** Atlassian P3 Senior DE = Google L4 DE = Databricks Senior DE = Snowflake Senior DE = Confluent Senior DE

The P2-to-P3 jump brings ownership of a product area's data infrastructure strategy and $98K+ in RSU delta over four years. If you have 4+ years with data pipeline architecture at scale, push for P3.

### AI Orchestra Lever

The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine made Data Engineers the pipeline builders of the AI Orchestra -- constructing the data infrastructure that makes everything work.

As the Conductor pipeline builder: You build the data pipelines that feed Rovo AI agents -- training data extraction from millions of Jira issues, Confluence pages, and service desk tickets; feature stores that serve real-time signals to AI models; and data quality systems that ensure Rovo agents learn from clean, representative data across 300,000+ enterprise customers.

As the Instrument pipeline builder: You build the Guard Premium data governance infrastructure -- data lineage tracking that shows what data flows to which AI agent, access audit trails that document every agent's data consumption, and compliance reporting pipelines that prove enterprise customers' data is handled according to SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR requirements.

Frame this: "I build the data infrastructure the AI Orchestra runs on. The Conductor data pipelines feed Rovo AI agents; the Instrument data governance pipelines power Guard Premium compliance. Post the Feb 2, 2026 rollout, this dual data infrastructure is the foundation of Atlassian's Agentic Future -- and without the right data engineering, neither Rovo agents nor Guard Premium governance can function."

---

#### Global Levers

1. **No Bonus = All Negotiation Goes to Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM).** Zero bonus means equity is your only variable lever. Push for 25% above initial: "My current role includes a 10-15% bonus. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $210K in TEAM RSUs over 4 years to bring total comp to parity. With offers from Databricks and Confluent that include bonuses, the RSU gap is real."

2. **Guard Premium + Rovo AI Orchestra Data Infrastructure (Feb 2, 2026 Rollout).** Position yourself as the AI Orchestra pipeline builder: "Post the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout, I build both sides of the data infrastructure: Conductor pipelines feeding Rovo AI agents (training data, feature stores, real-time signals) and Instrument pipelines powering Guard Premium governance (data lineage, audit trails, compliance reporting). The AI Orchestra runs on what I build."

3. **Proprietary Collaboration Dataset at Enterprise Scale.** Atlassian's data is unmatched: "Atlassian has millions of Jira issues, Confluence pages, and service desk tickets from 300,000+ enterprises. I build the pipelines that make this proprietary collaboration dataset available for AI training and product analytics -- data infrastructure at a scale no competitor can match."

4. **Cloud Migration Analytics Pipeline Premium.** The Server-to-Cloud migration is data-intensive: "I build the analytics pipelines that track migration progress, customer health, and expansion revenue -- the data infrastructure that drives Atlassian's most important business initiative."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Level first -- P3 vs. P2 is $98K+ in TEAM RSUs over 4 years. Then push RSUs to $210K-$238K over 4 years. Anchor: "I have a Databricks offer at $280K total comp including 15% bonus. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $228K in Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) plus $190K base." Emphasize AI Orchestra data infrastructure from the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout: "I build the Conductor data pipelines feeding Rovo AI agents and the Instrument data governance pipelines powering Guard Premium compliance. The Agentic Future runs on my data infrastructure." Accept-at floor: $165K base / $165K TEAM RSUs for P2; $188K base / $210K TEAM RSUs for P3.
