### ML/AI Engineer | Atlassian Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy RSU/4yr + No Bonus | Team Anywhere Distributed | AI Orchestra Positioning | Guard Premium + Rovo Rollout Leverage | +15-25% Agentic AI Premium

---

Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM, $4.4B+ ARR) powers collaboration for 300,000+ enterprise customers and 10M+ monthly active users through Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket, Jira Service Management, and Loom. The ML/AI Engineer builds Atlassian Intelligence -- the AI layer embedded across every product -- and the Rovo AI agent platform that powers autonomous enterprise workflows. Since the Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine, ML/AI Engineers are the AI Orchestra's principal instrumentalists: building the AI agents (Rovo) that the orchestra plays, while designing the intelligence layer that operates within Guard Premium governance constraints. The Conductor/Instrument dual role for ML/AI Engineers means building both the autonomous agent capabilities and the governance-aware AI architecture. Compensation is no-bonus, RSU-heavy (Atlassian RSUs -- NASDAQ: TEAM), with a 15-25% Agentic AI Premium.

#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at Atlassian build the intelligence that powers the entire platform. The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Guard Premium and Rovo AI made this role the core of the AI Orchestra: you build the agents that the orchestra plays. As the AI Orchestra's principal instrumentalist, you design and train the Rovo AI agents that automate Jira issue routing, Confluence content generation, code review suggestions, and cross-product workflow orchestration. The Conductor/Instrument dual role for ML/AI Engineers means: you build the AI agent capabilities that Conductors orchestrate (the intelligence layer), and you design AI architectures that respect Guard Premium governance constraints (governance-aware models that understand access controls, data boundaries, and compliance requirements). The unique training data -- millions of Jira issues, Confluence pages, and service desk tickets from 300,000+ enterprises -- creates an AI moat no competitor can replicate. Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) represent 45-55% of total comp with no bonus.

#### Level Mapping

| Atlassian Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---|---|---|
| P3 (ML Engineer) | ML/AI Engineer | 3-6 years |
| P4 (Senior ML Eng) | Senior ML/AI Engineer | 6-10 years |
| P5 (Staff ML Eng) | Staff / Principal ML Engineer | 10+ years |

**Level Mapping:** Atlassian P4 Senior ML Eng = Google L4 ML = Meta E4 ML = Microsoft 63 ML = Datadog Senior ML

The P3-to-P4 jump brings ownership of an ML domain (NLP, recommendation systems, autonomous agents) and $130K+ in RSU delta over four years. If you have 6+ years building production ML systems, push for P4.

### AI Orchestra Lever

The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine made ML/AI Engineers the principal instrumentalists of the AI Orchestra. You build the instruments the orchestra plays -- the Rovo AI agents themselves.

As the Conductor-side builder: You design and train the Rovo AI agents that automate enterprise workflows across the Atlassian suite. Intelligent issue routing in Jira, content summarization in Confluence, automated code review in Bitbucket, smart search across products, and autonomous workflow agents that act on behalf of users. These are the instruments the AI Orchestra plays.

As the Instrument-side architect: You design AI architectures that are governance-aware -- models that understand Guard Premium access controls, respect data boundaries between enterprise customers, generate auditable outputs, and refuse actions that violate security policies. This is governance-by-design in the AI layer.

Frame this: "I build the Rovo AI agents that the AI Orchestra plays -- and I design them to be governance-aware from the ground up. The Conductor/Instrument dual role for ML/AI Engineers means building autonomous agents that are both powerful and trustworthy. Post the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout, this is the core technical challenge at Atlassian -- and the 15-25% Agentic AI Premium reflects how scarce this capability is."

#### Global Levers

1. **No Bonus + Agentic AI Premium = Maximum RSU Leverage (NASDAQ: TEAM).** ML/AI engineers building autonomous agents command a 15-25% premium. Push aggressively: "ML engineers building enterprise collaboration AI are scarce. With no bonus, I need $300K in TEAM RSUs over 4 years. My competing offer at Google/Meta includes bonus and refreshers -- the RSU grant must close a significant gap."

2. **Guard Premium + Rovo AI Orchestra Agent Architecture (Feb 2, 2026 Rollout).** Position yourself as the person who builds the AI agents: "Post the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout, I build the Rovo AI agents that the AI Orchestra plays -- the Conductor instruments. I also design governance-aware AI architectures that respect Guard Premium policies -- the Instrument-side design. This Conductor/Instrument dual capability in the ML/AI layer is the scarcest and most valuable skill in Atlassian's Agentic Future."

3. **Proprietary Collaboration Data Moat.** Atlassian's training data is unique: "Atlassian has millions of Jira issues, Confluence pages, and service desk tickets from 300,000+ enterprises. This proprietary collaboration dataset trains AI models that understand how teams work -- knowledge no competitor has. I turn this data moat into AI product value."

4. **Multi-Product AI Deployment.** One model, many products: "My ML models power AI features across 6+ products simultaneously -- Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket, JSM, Loom. One model, multi-product deployment -- compounding impact that justifies premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Level first -- P4 vs. P3 is $130K+ in TEAM RSUs. Then push RSUs to $300K-$335K over 4 years with the 15-25% Agentic AI Premium. Anchor: "I have a Google ML offer at $380K total comp and a Meta ML offer at $390K, both with bonuses and refreshers. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $320K in Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) plus $215K base." Emphasize AI Orchestra agent builder capability from the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout: "I build the Rovo AI agents the orchestra plays and design governance-aware architectures for Guard Premium. The Conductor/Instrument dual role in the ML layer is the Agentic Future's core capability." Accept-at floor: $190K base / $240K TEAM RSUs for P3; $215K base / $300K TEAM RSUs for P4.
