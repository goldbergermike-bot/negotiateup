#### Negotiation DNA

Solutions Architects at Atlassian are the trusted technical advisors for the company's largest enterprise customers. The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Guard Premium and Rovo AI transformed the SA role: you now guide enterprises through AI Orchestra adoption. This means designing how customers deploy Rovo AI agents across their Atlassian instance (the Conductor architecture), configuring Guard Premium governance policies that meet their regulatory and compliance requirements (the Instrument architecture), and advising on the Conductor/Instrument dual role implementation at the enterprise level. You are the AI Orchestra consultant who makes the Agentic Future real for customers. Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) represent 40-48% of total comp with no bonus.

#### Level Mapping

| Atlassian Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---|---|---|
| P3 (Solutions Architect) | Solutions Architect | 5-8 years |
| P4 (Senior SA) | Senior / Principal Solutions Architect | 8-12 years |
| P5 (Principal SA) | Distinguished / Enterprise Architect | 12+ years |

**Level Mapping:** Atlassian P4 Senior SA = Google L5 SA = AWS Senior SA = Microsoft Senior Cloud SA = Salesforce Senior SA

The P3-to-P4 jump brings ownership of technical strategy for major enterprise accounts and $94K+ in RSU delta over four years. If you have 8+ years designing enterprise architecture for Fortune 500 customers, push for P4.

### AI Orchestra Lever

The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine made Solutions Architects the customer-facing champions of the AI Orchestra model. Enterprise customers need guidance on how to adopt autonomous AI agents safely -- and the SA is the person who provides it.

As the customer-facing AI Orchestra advisor, you design the Conductor architecture: how Rovo AI agents are deployed across the customer's Atlassian instance, which workflows they automate, how they integrate with existing tools, and how users interact with them. You also design the Instrument architecture: how Guard Premium governance policies are configured to meet the customer's specific compliance requirements (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, FedRAMP), how audit trails are structured, and how data access controls constrain agent behavior.

Frame this: "I've designed enterprise architectures incorporating AI capabilities with governance-first compliance. The AI Orchestra model -- advising enterprises on Rovo AI agent deployment (Conductor architecture) and Guard Premium governance configuration (Instrument architecture) -- is exactly what I do. Post the Feb 2, 2026 rollout, every enterprise customer needs an SA who can guide their AI Orchestra adoption."

#### Global Levers

1. **No Bonus = All Negotiation Goes to Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM).** SAs at many companies receive variable commission or bonus tied to customer outcomes. At Atlassian, there is none. Push hard: "My current role includes a 15-20% variable bonus tied to customer success. Since Atlassian has no variable comp, I need $200K in TEAM RSUs over 4 years to reach total comp parity."

2. **Guard Premium + Rovo AI Orchestra Customer Advisory (Feb 2, 2026 Rollout).** Position yourself as the enterprise AI Orchestra advisor: "Since the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout, every enterprise customer needs guidance on AI Orchestra adoption. I design the Conductor architecture (Rovo agent deployment) and the Instrument architecture (Guard Premium governance configuration). This AI Orchestra advisory is the new core of the SA role."

3. **Cloud Migration Architecture Is Revenue-Critical.** Every enterprise moving Server-to-Cloud needs an SA: "I've designed and led cloud migration architectures for [X] enterprise customers, migrating [Y]TB of data and [Z] integrations. This is Atlassian's most urgent customer-facing technical challenge."

4. **Multi-Product Platform Architecture Premium.** Atlassian's value is the integrated platform: "I've architected enterprise deployments spanning [X] integrated products, designing the workflows and integrations that unlock platform-level value beyond individual tools. This cross-product design is essential for Atlassian."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Level first -- P4 vs. P3 is $94K+ in TEAM RSUs over 4 years. Then push RSUs to $200K-$235K over 4 years. Anchor: "I have an AWS Senior SA offer at $290K total comp including bonus. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $220K in Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) plus $190K base." Emphasize AI Orchestra advisory capability from the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout: "I guide enterprises through Rovo AI agent deployment (Conductor architecture) and Guard Premium governance configuration (Instrument architecture). This AI Orchestra advisory is the new SA value proposition." Accept-at floor: $168K base / $170K TEAM RSUs for P3; $195K base / $215K TEAM RSUs for P4.
