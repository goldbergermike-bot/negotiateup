### Technical Program Manager | Atlassian Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy RSU/4yr + No Bonus | Team Anywhere Distributed | AI Orchestra Positioning | Guard Premium + Rovo Rollout Leverage

---

Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM, $4.4B+ ARR) powers collaboration for 300,000+ enterprise customers and 10M+ monthly active users through Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket, Jira Service Management, and Loom. The Technical Program Manager drives execution of Atlassian's most complex, cross-functional technical initiatives -- from cloud migration programs to AI platform rollouts. Since the Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine, TPMs are the AI Orchestra program leaders: coordinating the cross-functional effort to ship Rovo AI agent capabilities while ensuring Guard Premium governance meets enterprise compliance requirements. The Conductor/Instrument dual role is the program the TPM manages. Compensation is no-bonus, RSU-heavy (Atlassian RSUs -- NASDAQ: TEAM).

#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at Atlassian coordinate the execution of multi-quarter, multi-team technical initiatives. The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Guard Premium and Rovo AI is the defining TPM challenge: shipping an autonomous AI agent platform (Rovo) across the entire product suite while simultaneously rolling out enterprise security governance (Guard Premium). The TPM is the AI Orchestra program manager -- the person who ensures the Conductor (Rovo agent development) and Instrument (Guard Premium governance) workstreams ship on time, in coordination, and at quality. This is Atlassian's Agentic Future, and the TPM manages its execution. Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) represent 40-47% of total comp with no bonus.

#### Level Mapping

| Atlassian Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---|---|---|
| P3 (TPM) | Technical Program Manager | 5-8 years |
| P4 (Senior TPM) | Senior TPM | 8-12 years |
| P5 (Principal TPM) | Principal / Staff TPM | 12+ years |

**Level Mapping:** Atlassian P4 Senior TPM = Google L5 TPM = Meta IC5 TPM = Microsoft 63-64 TPM = Amazon Senior TPgM

The P3-to-P4 jump signals ownership of multi-quarter, multi-team programs with company-level impact. The RSU difference is $90K+ over four years. If you have 8+ years managing complex technical programs, push for P4.

### AI Orchestra Lever

The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine is, in program management terms, one of the most complex cross-functional initiatives in Atlassian's history. The TPM is the AI Orchestra program manager -- coordinating the simultaneous development and rollout of two interlinked systems:

The Conductor workstream: Shipping Rovo AI agent capabilities across Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, JSM, and Loom. This requires coordinating engineering, product, design, and QA across every major product team.

The Instrument workstream: Rolling out Guard Premium governance -- security policies, access controls, audit trails, and compliance certifications -- that enterprise customers require before adopting autonomous AI agents.

The AI Orchestra model means these two workstreams must ship together. An AI agent without governance is a liability; governance without AI agents is overhead. The TPM ensures the Conductor and Instrument ship in harmony.

Frame this: "I've managed the cross-functional program for shipping AI-powered products with security governance in parallel -- the exact Conductor/Instrument coordination challenge. Post the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout, this AI Orchestra program management is the highest-complexity TPM work at Atlassian. I manage the program that makes the Agentic Future ship."

#### Global Levers

1. **No Bonus = All Negotiation Goes to Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM).** Zero bonus means equity is your only variable lever. Push for 25-30% above initial: "My current role includes a 10-15% milestone-based bonus. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $195K in TEAM RSUs over 4 years to bridge the total comp gap."

2. **Guard Premium + Rovo AI Orchestra Program Management (Feb 2, 2026 Rollout).** Position yourself as the AI Orchestra program manager: "The Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout is a dual-workstream program: shipping Rovo AI agent capabilities (Conductor) while rolling out Guard Premium governance (Instrument) in parallel. I've managed exactly this type of coordinated AI + security program. The AI Orchestra program management is the defining TPM challenge."

3. **Cloud Migration Program Execution Premium.** The Server-to-Cloud migration is a multi-year TPM challenge: "I've managed a cloud migration program involving [X] engineering teams, [Y] customer milestones, and $[Z] in revenue impact. This is exactly the program execution challenge Atlassian's migration requires."

4. **Distributed Program Management at Scale.** Atlassian's Team Anywhere model makes distributed coordination core: "I've managed programs spanning [X] time zones with [Y] distributed engineering teams, using Jira, Confluence, and Loom -- the same tools Atlassian builds and uses internally."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Level first -- P4 vs. P3 is $90K+ in TEAM RSUs over 4 years. Then push RSUs to $195K-$225K over 4 years. Anchor: "I have an Amazon Senior TPgM offer at $310K total comp including bonus. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $210K in Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) plus $185K base." Emphasize AI Orchestra program management from the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout: "I manage the dual-workstream program: Rovo AI agent capabilities (Conductor) shipping in coordination with Guard Premium governance (Instrument). This AI Orchestra program management is the highest-complexity TPM work in the company." Accept-at floor: $162K base / $160K TEAM RSUs for P3; $188K base / $200K TEAM RSUs for P4.
