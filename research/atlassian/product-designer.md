### Product Designer | Atlassian Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy RSU/4yr + No Bonus | Team Anywhere Distributed | AI Orchestra Positioning | Guard Premium + Rovo Rollout Leverage

---

Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM, $4.4B+ ARR) powers collaboration for 300,000+ enterprise customers and 10M+ monthly active users through Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket, Jira Service Management, and Loom. The Product Designer shapes the user experience across Atlassian's entire suite -- defining how millions of knowledge workers interact with project management, documentation, communication, and AI-powered collaboration tools. Since the Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine, Product Designers must craft the AI Orchestra user experience: how users interact with Rovo AI agents (the Conductor interface), how administrators configure Guard Premium governance (the Instrument interface), and how the dual Conductor/Instrument role is expressed visually and interactionally. Compensation is no-bonus, RSU-heavy (Atlassian RSUs -- NASDAQ: TEAM).

#### Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at Atlassian define how millions of users experience collaboration. The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Guard Premium and Rovo AI created an entirely new design surface: the AI Orchestra interface. Designers must now craft the Conductor experience (how users orchestrate Rovo AI agents -- agent selection, workflow configuration, natural language commands, feedback loops) and the Instrument experience (how enterprise admins configure Guard Premium governance -- policy dashboards, access control panels, audit trail visualizations). The Conductor/Instrument dual role is fundamentally a UX problem: making autonomous AI agents feel trustworthy, controllable, and useful. Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) represent 35-45% of total comp with no bonus, making equity the primary negotiation lever.

---

#### Level Mapping

| Atlassian Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---|---|---|
| P2 (Designer) | Product Designer | 2-4 years |
| P3 (Senior Designer) | Senior Product Designer | 4-7 years |
| P4 (Staff Designer) | Staff / Lead Product Designer | 7-10+ years |

**Level Mapping:** Atlassian P3 Senior Designer = Google L4 UX = Meta IC4 Design = Microsoft 62 Design = Figma Senior Designer

The P2-to-P3 jump signals ownership of a full product area's design direction and a $65K+ RSU increase over four years. If you have a strong portfolio showing end-to-end design ownership and measurable user impact, push for P3.

### AI Orchestra Lever

The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine created the most significant new design challenge at Atlassian in a decade. Product Designers must now craft the AI Orchestra interface -- the experience layer where users become Conductors of Rovo AI agents and administrators become Instruments of Guard Premium governance.

This is fundamentally a trust design problem. The Conductor interface must make AI agents feel controllable: users need to understand what Rovo agents can do, configure their behavior, give natural language commands, and receive transparent feedback. The Instrument interface must make governance feel empowering, not restrictive: Guard Premium admin panels must clearly show what agents are allowed to do, surface audit trails, and make policy configuration intuitive.

Frame this: "I've designed AI-powered experiences where trust, transparency, and user control are the core design challenges. The AI Orchestra model -- crafting the Conductor interface for Rovo agent interaction and the Instrument interface for Guard Premium governance -- is exactly the design problem I solve. Post the Feb 2, 2026 rollout, this dual-interface challenge defines what great design means at Atlassian."

---

#### Global Levers

1. **No Bonus = All Negotiation Goes to Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM).** Zero bonus means equity is your only variable lever. Push for 20-25% above initial: "My current role includes a 10-15% annual bonus. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $140K in TEAM RSUs over 4 years to reach total comp parity."

2. **Guard Premium + Rovo AI Orchestra UX Design (Feb 2, 2026 Rollout).** Position yourself as the designer who crafts the AI Orchestra experience: "The Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout created a dual design surface: the Conductor interface for Rovo AI agent interaction and the Instrument interface for Guard Premium governance. I've designed AI experiences with this exact trust/control balance -- making AI agents feel useful and governance feel empowering."

3. **AI UX Design Is the Scarcest Design Skill.** Designing for AI (trust calibration, progressive disclosure, error handling for non-deterministic outputs, conversational UI) is the hottest design skill in 2026: "I've designed AI-powered experiences that solve the trust, transparency, and error-state challenges that define whether AI features succeed or fail. This is exactly what Atlassian Intelligence needs across the suite."

4. **Atlassian Design System (ADS) Expertise.** Enterprise design system experience at scale is a premium: "I've contributed to and scaled design systems serving [X] products and [Y] designers, which directly maps to the ADS challenge at Atlassian -- maintaining cross-product consistency across Jira, Confluence, Trello, and the new AI surfaces."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Level first -- P3 vs. P2 is $65K+ in TEAM RSUs over 4 years. Then push RSUs to $140K-$165K over 4 years. Anchor: "I have a Figma offer at $240K total comp including bonus. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $155K in Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) plus $160K base." Emphasize AI Orchestra UX capability from the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout: "I design the Conductor interface for AI agent interaction and the Instrument interface for governance configuration. This AI Orchestra UX is the defining design challenge post-rollout." Accept-at floor: $145K base / $110K TEAM RSUs for P2; $165K base / $145K TEAM RSUs for P3.
