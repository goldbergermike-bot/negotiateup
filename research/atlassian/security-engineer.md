### Security Engineer | Atlassian Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy RSU/4yr + No Bonus | Team Anywhere Distributed | AI Orchestra Positioning | Guard Premium + Rovo Rollout Leverage | Security Talent Shortage Premium

---

Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM, $4.4B+ ARR) powers collaboration for 300,000+ enterprise customers and 10M+ monthly active users through Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket, Jira Service Management, and Loom. The Security Engineer protects one of the most widely-used enterprise collaboration platforms in the world. Since the Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine, Security Engineers are the AI Orchestra's chief Instrument builders: they design, implement, and enforce the Guard Premium security governance layer that constrains every Rovo AI agent action. The Conductor/Instrument dual role places Security Engineers at the center of the trust architecture that makes the Agentic Future viable. Without Security Engineers, the AI Orchestra cannot play safely. Compensation is no-bonus, RSU-heavy (Atlassian RSUs -- NASDAQ: TEAM), with a structural talent shortage premium.

#### Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at Atlassian are the guardians of enterprise trust. The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Guard Premium and Rovo AI made Security Engineers the most critical role in the AI Orchestra. You are the chief Instrument builder: designing the Guard Premium security governance framework that controls every Rovo AI agent action -- data access policies, audit trails, compliance enforcement, and runtime security monitoring. The Conductor/Instrument dual role means Security Engineers ensure that as engineering teams orchestrate Rovo AI agents (Conductor), every agent action passes through the security governance layer (Instrument) that you design and maintain. You are the person who makes 300,000+ enterprise customers trust autonomous AI agents with their data. Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) represent 43-50% of total comp with no bonus, and the structural security talent shortage gives you more leverage than most other roles.

#### Level Mapping

| Atlassian Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---|---|---|
| P3 (Security Engineer) | Security Engineer | 4-7 years |
| P4 (Senior Security Eng) | Senior Security Engineer | 7-10 years |
| P5 (Staff Security Eng) | Staff / Principal Security Engineer | 10+ years |

**Level Mapping:** Atlassian P4 Senior SecEng = Google L4 SecEng = Meta E4 SecEng = Microsoft 63 SecEng = CrowdStrike Senior SecEng

The P3-to-P4 jump brings ownership of a security domain (application security, cloud security, detection and response, AI security) and $110K+ in RSU delta over four years. If you have 7+ years in cloud security or application security, push for P4.

### AI Orchestra Lever

The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine made Security Engineers the most essential role in the AI Orchestra. You are the chief Instrument builder -- the person who designs and enforces the security governance layer that makes autonomous AI agents trustworthy.

Guard Premium is the security product you build: enterprise security policies, data access controls, threat detection rules, audit trails, and compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, FedRAMP) that constrain every Rovo AI agent action. Without Guard Premium, enterprise customers will not adopt Rovo. Without Security Engineers, Guard Premium does not exist.

The Conductor/Instrument dual role for Security Engineers means: engineering teams orchestrate Rovo AI agents (Conductor) to automate workflows, but every agent action must pass through the Guard Premium governance layer (Instrument) that you design. AI agent security -- prompt injection prevention, data exfiltration controls, agent action audit trails, and runtime anomaly detection -- is an entirely new security surface that the Feb 2, 2026 rollout created.

Frame this: "I build the Instrument layer of the AI Orchestra. Guard Premium governance is what makes 300,000+ enterprise customers trust Rovo AI agents with their data. The Conductor/Instrument dual role depends on Security Engineers -- without the Instrument, the AI Orchestra is a liability. Post Feb 2, 2026, AI agent security is the most critical and scarcest security skill at Atlassian."

#### Global Levers

1. **No Bonus + Security Talent Shortage = Maximum RSU Leverage (NASDAQ: TEAM).** Security engineers are in a structural talent shortage. Push aggressively: "The security talent market is extremely competitive. My current role includes a 15-20% annual bonus plus equity. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $250K in TEAM RSUs over 4 years. The security engineer shortage means Atlassian has less ability to say no than with most other roles."

2. **Guard Premium + Rovo AI Orchestra Security Architecture (Feb 2, 2026 Rollout).** Position yourself as the AI Orchestra Instrument builder: "I build the Guard Premium governance layer that makes Rovo AI agents trustworthy. Post the Feb 2, 2026 rollout, AI agent security is the new frontier: prompt injection prevention, data access controls, agent action audit trails, and runtime anomaly detection. The Conductor/Instrument dual role depends on my work -- without the Instrument, the AI Orchestra fails."

3. **AI Security Is an Emerging Premium.** Securing AI agents is a new and extremely scarce skill: "I have experience securing AI/ML systems including model security, data governance for training pipelines, and prompt injection mitigation. Guard Premium and Rovo AI create exactly these security challenges at enterprise scale -- and the number of security engineers who understand AI agent security is extremely small."

4. **Bitbucket Supply Chain Security.** Atlassian owns Bitbucket, creating dual product/internal supply chain security needs: "I've built supply chain security programs covering code integrity, dependency scanning, and CI/CD pipeline hardening. At Atlassian, this expertise serves both Bitbucket product security and internal engineering security simultaneously."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Security engineers have structural talent shortage leverage. Level first -- P4 vs. P3 is $110K+ in TEAM RSUs. Then push RSUs to $250K-$280K over 4 years. Anchor: "I have a CrowdStrike offer at $340K total comp including 20% bonus. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $265K in Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) plus $200K base." Emphasize AI Orchestra Instrument builder role from the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout: "I build the Guard Premium governance layer -- the Instrument that makes the Conductor/Instrument dual role work. AI agent security (Rovo) is the scarcest and most critical security skill post-rollout." Accept-at floor: $182K base / $200K TEAM RSUs for P3; $210K base / $260K TEAM RSUs for P4.
