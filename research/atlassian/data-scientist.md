### Data Scientist | Atlassian Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy RSU/4yr + No Bonus | Team Anywhere Distributed | AI Orchestra Positioning | Guard Premium + Rovo Rollout Leverage

---

Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM, $4.4B+ ARR) powers collaboration for 300,000+ enterprise customers and 10M+ monthly active users through Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket, Jira Service Management, and Loom. The Data Scientist derives insights from one of the richest enterprise collaboration datasets in the world -- informing product decisions, pricing strategy, cloud migration optimization, and AI feature development. Since the Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine, Data Scientists play the AI Orchestra measurement role: evaluating Rovo AI agent effectiveness, measuring Guard Premium governance impact on customer trust, and providing the data-driven feedback loops that make the Conductor/Instrument dual role work at scale. Compensation is no-bonus, RSU-heavy (Atlassian RSUs -- NASDAQ: TEAM).

#### Compensation Ranges by Region

| Component | Sydney (AUD A$) | San Francisco (USD) | Amsterdam (EUR) |
|---|---|---|---|

| **Stock (Atlassian RSUs -- NASDAQ: TEAM, 4yr vest)** | A$167,000 - A$332,000 | $152,000 - $255,000 | EUR 95,000 - EUR 175,000 |
| **Bonus** | None | None | None |

#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at Atlassian sit at the intersection of product analytics, experimentation, and AI evaluation. The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Guard Premium and Rovo AI elevated the DS role: you are now the AI Orchestra critic and analyst. You measure whether Rovo AI agents actually improve workflows (Conductor effectiveness), evaluate whether Guard Premium governance policies enhance or hinder customer trust (Instrument calibration), and design the experiments that determine how the Conductor/Instrument dual role evolves over time. You own the feedback loop that makes the Agentic Future data-driven. Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) represent 40-50% of total comp with no bonus, making equity the primary negotiation lever.

---

#### Level Mapping

| Atlassian Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---|---|---|
| P2 (Data Scientist) | Data Scientist | 2-4 years |
| P3 (Senior DS) | Senior Data Scientist | 4-7 years |
| P4 (Staff DS) | Staff / Lead Data Scientist | 7-10+ years |

**Level Mapping:** Atlassian P3 Senior DS = Google L4 DS = Meta IC4 DS = Microsoft 62 DS = Datadog Senior DS

The P2-to-P3 jump brings ownership of a product area's analytics strategy and $100K+ in RSU difference over four years. If you have 4+ years with causal inference, experiment design, or product analytics at scale, push for P3.

### AI Orchestra Lever

The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine made Data Scientists the essential feedback mechanism for the AI Orchestra. You are the person who measures whether the orchestra is playing in tune. As the AI Orchestra analyst, you evaluate Rovo AI agent performance (Are agents improving workflow efficiency? Are users adopting the Conductor role?), measure Guard Premium governance effectiveness (Do security policies increase enterprise customer trust? Does governance reduce churn?), and design the A/B experiments that determine how the Conductor/Instrument dual role evolves.

Without DS measurement, Atlassian cannot know if its Agentic Future is working. Frame this: "I've designed evaluation frameworks for AI-powered features -- measuring quality, trust, adoption, and business impact. The AI Orchestra model needs exactly this: data-driven assessment of Rovo AI agent effectiveness (Conductor metrics) and Guard Premium governance impact (Instrument metrics). Post the Feb 2, 2026 rollout, I'm the person who tells Atlassian whether the Agentic Future is delivering value."

#### Global Levers

1. **No Bonus = All Negotiation Goes to Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM).** Zero bonus means equity is your only variable lever. Push for 25-30% above initial: "My current role includes a 15-20% annual bonus plus equity. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $220K in TEAM RSUs over 4 years to bring total comp to parity."

2. **Guard Premium + Rovo AI Orchestra Measurement (Feb 2, 2026 Rollout).** Position yourself as the AI Orchestra analyst: "Since the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout, Atlassian needs to measure whether the AI Orchestra is working. I design the evaluation frameworks that assess Rovo AI agent effectiveness (Conductor metrics) and Guard Premium governance impact (Instrument calibration). Without this measurement, the Agentic Future is flying blind."

3. **Proprietary Collaboration Dataset.** Atlassian's data is unmatched: "Atlassian has millions of Jira issues, Confluence pages, and service desk tickets from 300,000+ enterprises. This proprietary collaboration dataset enables insights no competitor can replicate. I extract the signal that drives product and AI strategy."

4. **Team Anywhere Analytics Advantage.** DS work is inherently async and remote-friendly: "Data science deliverables -- analyses, dashboards, experiment results -- are inherently async. Atlassian's Team Anywhere model means I deliver the same impact from any location, with purchasing power 30-50% higher outside major metros."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Level first -- P3 vs. P2 is $100K+ in TEAM RSUs over 4 years. Then push RSUs to $220K-$255K over 4 years. Anchor: "I have a Google DS offer at $310K total comp including 15% bonus. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $240K in Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) plus $185K base." Emphasize AI Orchestra measurement capability from the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout: "I design the evaluation frameworks for Rovo AI agent effectiveness and Guard Premium governance impact -- the Conductor and Instrument metrics that determine whether the Agentic Future delivers value." Accept-at floor: $170K base / $180K TEAM RSUs for P2; $195K base / $230K TEAM RSUs for P3.
