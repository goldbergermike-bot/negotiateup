### Engineering Manager | Atlassian Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy RSU/4yr + No Bonus | Team Anywhere Distributed | AI Orchestra Positioning | Guard Premium + Rovo Rollout Leverage

---

Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM, $4.4B+ ARR) powers collaboration for 300,000+ enterprise customers through Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket, Jira Service Management, and Loom. The Engineering Manager at Atlassian owns pod-level delivery, team health, and technical strategy for a group of 6-12 engineers. Since the Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine, EMs are responsible for transforming their teams into AI Orchestra units -- ensuring every engineer operates in the Conductor/Instrument dual role, orchestrating Rovo AI agents while maintaining Guard Premium security governance. Compensation is no-bonus, RSU-heavy (Atlassian RSUs -- NASDAQ: TEAM).

#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at Atlassian own both the people and the technical strategy for their pod. The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Guard Premium and Rovo AI added a critical new dimension: EMs must now build teams that function as AI Orchestra units. This means hiring, training, and organizing engineers who operate in the Conductor/Instrument dual role -- orchestrating Rovo AI agents for workflow automation while maintaining Guard Premium security governance compliance. The EM is the AI Orchestra section leader: they do not just manage people, they orchestrate the orchestrators. Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) represent 45-55% of total comp with no bonus, making equity negotiation the primary lever.

#### Level Mapping

| Atlassian Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---|---|---|
| M3 (EM) | Engineering Manager | 7-10 years |
| M4 (Senior EM) | Senior EM / Director | 10-14 years |
| M5 (Director) | Director of Engineering | 14+ years |

**Level Mapping:** Atlassian M3 EM = Google L5 EM = Meta M1 = Microsoft 65 EM = Datadog EM

The M3-to-M4 jump adds multi-team ownership and significantly larger RSU grants -- $100K-$140K delta over four years. If you manage 2+ teams or have Director-level scope, push for M4.

### AI Orchestra Lever

The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine transformed the EM role at Atlassian. Engineering Managers are now responsible for building AI Orchestra teams -- groups of engineers who each operate in the Conductor/Instrument dual role. As an EM, you are the section leader of the AI Orchestra: you hire engineers who can orchestrate Rovo AI agents (Conductor) and build Guard Premium security governance (Instrument), and you create the team processes and rituals that make this dual role work.

This is Atlassian's Agentic Future strategy applied to people management. The EM must answer: "How do I build a team that ships autonomous AI agents (Rovo) while maintaining enterprise-grade security (Guard Premium) across 300,000+ customers?" The AI Orchestra conductor concept is not just a technical capability -- it is a team design principle.

Frame this: "I've built and led engineering teams that ship AI-powered products with security governance from day one. The Conductor/Instrument dual role that Guard Premium and Rovo create is a team design challenge, not just a technical one. I know how to hire, structure, and lead an AI Orchestra unit -- and that's what every Atlassian engineering pod needs after the Feb 2, 2026 rollout."

#### Global Levers

1. **No Bonus = All Negotiation Goes to Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM).** EMs at no-bonus companies lose the bonus trade lever. Push RSUs hard: "My current role includes a 20% management bonus plus equity. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $300K in TEAM RSUs over 4 years to achieve total comp parity. The absence of bonus means equity must carry the full variable load."

2. **Guard Premium + Rovo AI Orchestra Team Leadership (Feb 2, 2026 Rollout).** Position yourself as someone who builds AI Orchestra teams: "Since the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout, every Atlassian engineering pod needs to operate as an AI Orchestra unit. I've built teams that ship AI agent products with governance-first design -- the Conductor/Instrument dual role isn't just a technical skill, it's a team operating model I know how to implement."

3. **Distributed Team Leadership Premium.** Managing distributed teams is harder than co-located. Atlassian's Team Anywhere model makes this core: "I've managed distributed engineering teams across [X] time zones for [Y] years. Distributed EM at Atlassian requires async-first rituals, timezone-aware sprint planning, and remote mentorship -- I've operationalized all of these."

4. **Hiring and Retention in AI Talent Market.** EMs who can attract and retain AI-capable engineers are premium: "In the current AI talent market, my ability to recruit and retain engineers who can build Rovo AI agents and Guard Premium governance systems is a force multiplier. I've hired [X] engineers in the last year in the AI/ML space."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Level first -- M4 vs. M3 is $100K-$140K in TEAM RSUs over 4 years. Then push RSUs to $300K-$350K over 4 years at M4. Anchor: "I have a Google EM offer at $420K total comp including 15% bonus and refreshers. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $320K in Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) plus $225K base." Emphasize your ability to build AI Orchestra teams after the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout: "I build teams that operate in the Conductor/Instrument dual role -- orchestrating Rovo AI agents while enforcing Guard Premium governance. This is the Agentic Future team operating model." Accept-at floor: $210K base / $260K TEAM RSUs for M3; $235K base / $320K TEAM RSUs for M4.
