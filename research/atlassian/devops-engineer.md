### DevOps Engineer | Atlassian Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy RSU/4yr + No Bonus | Team Anywhere Distributed | AI Orchestra Positioning | Guard Premium + Rovo Rollout Leverage

---

Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM, $4.4B+ ARR) powers collaboration for 300,000+ enterprise customers and 10M+ monthly active users through Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket, Jira Service Management, and Loom. The DevOps Engineer owns the infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and platform reliability that keep Atlassian's cloud products running at massive scale. Since the Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine, DevOps Engineers operate as AI Orchestra infrastructure conductors: building and maintaining the platform that Rovo AI agents run on while enforcing the Guard Premium security governance policies that constrain agent behavior at the infrastructure level. The Conductor/Instrument dual role for DevOps means ensuring AI agents are both performant (Conductor) and secure (Instrument). Compensation is no-bonus, RSU-heavy (Atlassian RSUs -- NASDAQ: TEAM).

#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at Atlassian are the platform foundation -- every product, every AI agent, every security governance policy runs on infrastructure they build and maintain. The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Guard Premium and Rovo AI transformed DevOps into the AI Orchestra infrastructure layer. As the infrastructure conductor, you ensure Rovo AI agents have the compute, networking, and observability infrastructure to operate at enterprise scale. As the infrastructure instrument, you enforce Guard Premium governance at the platform level -- network segmentation, access controls, audit logging, and compliance enforcement that constrain what AI agents can do. The Conductor/Instrument dual role at the infrastructure level is DevOps-specific: you build the stage on which the AI Orchestra performs. Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) represent 40-48% of total comp with no bonus.

---

#### Level Mapping

| Atlassian Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|---|---|---|
| P2 (DevOps Engineer) | DevOps / Platform Engineer | 2-4 years |
| P3 (Senior DevOps) | Senior DevOps / SRE | 4-7 years |
| P4 (Staff DevOps) | Staff Platform / Infrastructure Engineer | 7-10+ years |

**Level Mapping:** Atlassian P3 Senior DevOps = Google L4 SRE = Meta E4 Production Eng = Microsoft 62 SRE = Datadog Senior Infra

The P2-to-P3 jump brings ownership of infrastructure strategy for a product area and a $98K+ RSU increase over four years. If you have 4+ years with cloud infrastructure at scale (AWS, Kubernetes), push for P3.

---

### AI Orchestra Lever

The Feb 2, 2026 rollout of Atlassian Guard Premium and the Rovo AI engine made DevOps Engineers the stagehands of the AI Orchestra -- the people who build and maintain the platform on which everything runs. The Conductor/Instrument dual role at the infrastructure level means:

As Conductor: You build the AI agent infrastructure -- model serving pipelines, vector databases, inference scaling, agent orchestration platforms, and the observability systems that monitor Rovo AI agent behavior across the product suite.

As Instrument: You enforce Guard Premium governance at the infrastructure layer -- network policies that isolate AI agent traffic, audit logging that tracks every agent action, access controls that limit what agents can reach, and compliance monitoring that ensures enterprise customers' data governance requirements are met.

Frame this: "I've built and operated infrastructure for AI agent systems with security governance baked in at the platform level. The AI Orchestra needs a stage -- and I build it. Post the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout, the Conductor/Instrument dual role at the infrastructure layer is the foundation of Atlassian's Agentic Future. Without the right platform, the AI Orchestra can't play."

---

#### Global Levers

1. **No Bonus = All Negotiation Goes to Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM).** Zero bonus means equity is your only variable lever. Push for 25-30% above initial: "My current role includes a 10-15% on-call premium plus annual bonus. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $200K in TEAM RSUs over 4 years to bridge total comp."

2. **Guard Premium + Rovo AI Orchestra Infrastructure (Feb 2, 2026 Rollout).** Position yourself as the infrastructure conductor: "The Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout requires infrastructure that supports autonomous AI agents at enterprise scale with security governance baked in. I build the Conductor infrastructure (agent serving, scaling, orchestration) and the Instrument infrastructure (Guard Premium policy enforcement, audit logging, network isolation). This Agentic Future runs on the platform I build."

3. **Cloud Migration Infrastructure Premium.** Atlassian's cloud migration is a DevOps-intensive initiative: "I've built migration infrastructure for [X]K customers moving from on-premise to cloud, including zero-downtime data migration and multi-tenant architecture. This maps directly to Atlassian's Server-to-Cloud infrastructure challenge."

4. **Bitbucket + CI/CD Dual Impact.** Atlassian owns Bitbucket, creating dual product/internal leverage: "I bring deep CI/CD pipeline expertise. At Atlassian, I can both improve Bitbucket Pipelines as a product and optimize internal developer experience -- dual impact that justifies top-of-band compensation."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Level first -- P3 vs. P2 is $98K+ in TEAM RSUs over 4 years. Then push RSUs to $200K-$240K over 4 years. Anchor: "I have a Datadog offer at $275K total comp including bonus and on-call premium. Since Atlassian has no bonus, I need $220K in Atlassian RSUs (NASDAQ: TEAM) plus $185K base." Emphasize AI Orchestra infrastructure capability from the Feb 2, 2026 Guard Premium/Rovo rollout: "I build the platform the AI Orchestra runs on -- Conductor infrastructure for Rovo agent serving and scaling, Instrument infrastructure for Guard Premium policy enforcement. The Agentic Future runs on what I build." Accept-at floor: $165K base / $165K TEAM RSUs for P2; $190K base / $215K TEAM RSUs for P3.
