**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at BCG protect the firm's and its clients' most sensitive strategic data. BCG handles confidential information for virtually every major corporation — M&A plans, competitive intelligence, and transformation strategies. A security breach at BCG would be catastrophic to the firm's trust-based business model. Security engineers also protect BCG X client deployments, ensuring that the software BCG builds for clients meets enterprise security standards. BCG does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (25-45%). The firm has increased security investment significantly as AI deployments introduce new attack surfaces and data protection requirements. [Source: BCG Information Security 2025-2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Client Trust Protection:** "BCG's $12B+ business runs on client trust. My security work directly protects the firm's most critical asset — its reputation for confidentiality across thousands of client relationships."
2. **BCG X Deployment Security:** "BCG X ships production software to Fortune 500 clients. I ensure these deployments meet enterprise security requirements — a failure here directly impacts client relationships and engagement revenue."
3. **AI Security Complexity:** "GenAI deployments introduce new security vectors — prompt injection, data poisoning, model extraction. Security engineers with AI security expertise are exceptionally scarce."
4. **Security Talent Scarcity Premium:** "Security engineers are the most supply-constrained role in tech. The market pays $260K-$380K TC at comparable companies. BCG's cash structure needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm protecting the client confidentiality that BCG's entire business depends on. I need $210K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $30K signing bonus. Security talent is the scarcest in the market, and my alternatives offer $290K-$360K TC with equity." BCG will counter at $185K-$200K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $280K.
