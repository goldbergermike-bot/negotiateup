### Data Scientist | BCG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (30-50%) | No Equity | BCG GAMMA Premium Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

| Boston | $170K-$240K | None | $51K-$120K (30-50%) | $221K-$360K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at BCG — particularly those in BCG X (formerly BCG GAMMA) — are among the highest-paid data scientists in consulting. BCG GAMMA pioneered the analytics consulting model, and BCG X has become the industry leader in deploying advanced analytics and AI at enterprise scale. Data Scientists here work on client-facing engagements: building predictive models, designing AI strategies, and presenting statistical findings to C-suites. BCG actively recruits PhDs from top research institutions and pays a significant premium for quantitative expertise. Bonus at this level trends toward 30-50%, with top performers consistently above 40%. BCG's data scientists are expected to combine rigorous statistical methodology with business acumen — a rare combination that commands premium compensation.

**Level Mapping:** BCG Data Scientist = Google L4-L5 Research Scientist = Meta Research Scientist = Two Sigma Quant Researcher

**Global Levers**

1. **Client Engagement Revenue:** "Each BCG X analytics engagement generates $3M-$15M in fees. As lead Data Scientist, I'm delivering the analytical insights that justify those fees and drive client outcomes."
2. **PhD/Research Premium:** "My quantitative PhD represents 4-6 years of specialized training. BCG benefits immediately from this expertise. The premium for advanced research credentials should be 15-25% above standard engineering comp."
3. **BCG GAMMA Brand Premium:** "BCG GAMMA (now BCG X) is the most recognized analytics consulting brand. Working here means higher-stakes engagements and higher-impact deliverables — comp should reflect that."
4. **Hedge Fund/AI Lab Alternative:** "Data scientists with my background earn $350K-$500K+ at hedge funds and AI labs. BCG needs to offer cash comp that's competitive with the lower end of this range."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm bringing PhD-level expertise to BCG X's most strategic analytics engagements. I need $235K base with a 40% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $40K signing bonus. My alternatives at [hedge fund/AI lab] are at $400K-$480K TC." BCG will counter at $215K-$230K base. Push hard on signing bonus. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $350K.
