**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at BCG work within BCG X to design enterprise digital products, client-facing applications, and the firm's internal tools. BCG X has a mature design practice that approaches design with the same rigor BCG applies to strategy — research-backed, data-informed, and focused on measurable business impact. Designers at BCG X are embedded in client engagements: you conduct user research with enterprise customers, design digital products that get shipped to production, and present design strategies to C-level stakeholders. BCG does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (25-45%). The firm has grown its design practice significantly as digital product delivery becomes a larger share of BCG's revenue.

**Level Mapping:** BCG Product Designer = Google L4 UX = Meta IC4 Product Designer = Figma Senior Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Client-Facing Design Impact:** "I design products presented to Fortune 500 executives and deployed at enterprise scale. The design quality directly influences whether BCG X wins repeat engagements worth $5M-$20M."
2. **Design-Led Revenue Growth:** "BCG X's shift from strategy-only to design + build has unlocked new revenue streams. Designers are the differentiator in pitches against Accenture and Deloitte Digital."
3. **No-Equity Market Gap:** "Product designers at Figma, Airbnb, and Google earn $220K-$350K TC with equity. BCG's cash structure needs to close this gap."
4. **Cross-Industry Design Portfolio:** "Designing for BCG X means building a portfolio across healthcare, finance, retail, and technology — experience that's uniquely valuable and hard to replicate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm designing enterprise products for BCG X's highest-value client engagements. I need $190K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $25K signing bonus. My tech alternatives offer $260K-$320K TC with equity." BCG will counter at $170K-$180K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $245K+.
