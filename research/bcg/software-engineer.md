### Software Engineer | BCG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (25-50%) | No Equity | Elite Consulting Tech Org

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boston | $155K-$195K | None | $39K-$98K (25-50%) | $194K-$293K |
| New York | $160K-$200K | None | $40K-$100K (25-50%) | $200K-$300K |
| Bangalore | ₹25L-₹40L | None | ₹6L-₹20L (25-50%) | ₹31L-₹60L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at BCG work across the firm's internal technology platforms, BCG X client-facing products, and the firm's growing AI infrastructure. BCG's technology organization has expanded significantly as the firm moves beyond pure strategy consulting into technology implementation and digital transformation. BCG does not grant equity to non-partner employees — total comp is base + performance bonus (25-50%). The bonus is determined by individual performance, practice area performance, and firm-wide financial results. BCG has been particularly aggressive in hiring tech talent for its GenAI practice, and software engineers who can build production systems around LLMs are in especially high demand.

**Level Mapping:** BCG Software Engineer = Google L3-L4 = Meta E3-E4 = Amazon SDE I-II

**Global Levers**

1. **No-Equity Compensation Frame:** "My competing offers include equity worth $100K-$200K over 4 years. Since BCG doesn't offer equity, I need the base to bridge this structural gap in total comp."
2. **Consulting Revenue Enablement:** "BCG generates $12B+ in annual revenue, and the technology I build makes consultants more productive and client deliverables more impactful. The productivity multiplier across BCG's 30,000+ employees is enormous."
3. **GenAI Practice Growth:** "BCG's GenAI practice is growing 50%+ annually. Software engineers building GenAI infrastructure are the enablers of BCG's fastest-growing revenue stream."
4. **Signing Bonus Bridge:** Push for a $25K-$40K signing bonus. BCG routinely uses signing bonuses to compete for tech talent from equity-offering companies.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building at BCG, but the lack of equity means I need the base to compensate. I'm targeting $195K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $30K signing bonus. My tech offers are at $260K-$320K TC with equity." BCG will counter at $175K-$185K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $265K+.
