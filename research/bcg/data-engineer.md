### Data Engineer | BCG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (25-50%) | No Equity | BCG GAMMA Data Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boston | $160K-$200K | None | $40K-$100K (25-50%) | $200K-$300K |
| New York | $165K-$205K | None | $41K-$103K (25-50%) | $206K-$308K |
| Bangalore | ₹26L-₹42L | None | ₹7L-₹21L (25-50%) | ₹33L-₹63L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at BCG build the data pipelines, ETL systems, and analytics infrastructure that power BCG X (formerly BCG GAMMA) client engagements and the firm's internal analytics. BCG's data engineering practice is critical because every AI/ML engagement — the firm's fastest-growing revenue stream — starts with data infrastructure. Data Engineers at BCG work across industries: one quarter building healthcare data lakes, the next constructing financial services analytics pipelines. BCG does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (25-50%). The firm's investment in GenAI has dramatically increased demand for data engineers who can build the data foundations that LLM applications require.

**Level Mapping:** BCG Data Engineer = Google L3-L4 Data Engineer = Databricks Senior DE = Snowflake DE

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Enablement Foundation:** "Every BCG X AI engagement depends on my data infrastructure. Without reliable data pipelines, the firm can't deliver on $5M-$20M AI projects. I'm building the foundation that the firm's highest-margin work runs on."
2. **Cross-Industry Data Architecture:** "I build data solutions across 15-20+ client engagements per year. The reusable frameworks and accelerators I create multiply BCG X's delivery capacity."
3. **GenAI Data Requirements:** "GenAI applications require fundamentally different data architecture — RAG pipelines, vector databases, real-time data feeds. Data engineers with GenAI data infrastructure experience command a premium."
4. **No-Equity Market Adjustment:** "Data engineers at Databricks/Snowflake earn $250K-$350K TC with equity. BCG's cash structure needs to close this gap through competitive base and guaranteed bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the data infrastructure that enables BCG X's AI practice. I need $195K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $30K signing bonus. My tech alternatives offer $280K-$330K TC with equity." BCG will counter at $175K-$185K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $265K+.
