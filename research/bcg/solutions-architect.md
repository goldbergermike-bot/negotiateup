### Solutions Architect | BCG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (30-50%) | No Equity | Client-Facing Architecture Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boston | $185K-$235K | None | $56K-$118K (30-50%) | $241K-$353K |
| New York | $190K-$245K | None | $57K-$123K (30-50%) | $247K-$368K |
| London | £125K-£170K | None | £38K-£85K (30-50%) | £163K-£255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at BCG design the technical architecture for BCG X client engagements — translating consulting strategy into implementable technology solutions. This is a client-facing role where you present to CTOs, evaluate technology stacks, and design enterprise systems that BCG X engineering teams then build. SAs at BCG have unique credibility: the BCG brand opens doors, and your technical expertise closes them. Comp is base + performance bonus (30-50%), with client-facing SAs earning at the top of the bonus range. BCG's growing technology implementation practice depends on SAs who can sell and deliver complex architecture work alongside the firm's consulting partners.

**Level Mapping:** BCG Solutions Architect = AWS Senior SA = Google Cloud Customer Engineer (L5) = Accenture Technology MD

**Global Levers**

1. **Client Revenue Enablement:** "My architecture work directly enables BCG X engagements worth $5M-$30M. I'm designing the technical foundation that the entire engagement delivery depends on."
2. **Pre-Sales Technical Authority:** "My architecture presentations help BCG win competitive pitches against Accenture, Deloitte, and McKinsey. I'm not just delivering — I'm helping sell $10M+ engagements."
3. **Consulting Partner Equivalence:** "Solutions Architects at BCG operate at the same client-facing level as Principals and Partners. My comp should reflect this client interaction level."
4. **Implementation Practice Growth:** "BCG's technology implementation practice is growing 30%+ annually. SAs are the bridge between strategy and delivery — the practice can't grow without us."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm the technical face of BCG X in client engagements. I need $235K base with a 35% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $40K signing bonus. My architecture work enables $10M+ engagements. SA roles at cloud providers offer $300K-$400K TC with equity." BCG will counter at $210K-$225K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $335K.
