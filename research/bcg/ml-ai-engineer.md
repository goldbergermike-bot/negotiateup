**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at BCG build production AI systems for BCG X client engagements — taking models from prototype to production deployment at enterprise scale. BCG X has positioned itself as the leading consulting firm for AI implementation, and ML/AI engineers are the delivery backbone. This role combines deep technical ML expertise with client-facing delivery skills. BCG does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (30-50%). The firm has significantly increased ML/AI engineer compensation over the past two years as competition for this talent from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and AI startups has intensified. BCG X's AI practice is a major growth driver for the firm, and ML engineers are the most sought-after hires. [Source: BCG X AI Engineering Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** BCG ML/AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta E4-E5 ML = Anthropic Research Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **Production AI Delivery:** "ML/AI engineers who can deploy production AI systems at enterprise scale are exceptionally rare. Most ML talent stays in research. My production deployment skills directly enable BCG X to deliver on multi-million dollar AI engagements."
2. **GenAI Implementation Premium:** "BCG is the go-to firm for enterprise GenAI implementation. ML engineers building GenAI solutions are at the center of the firm's growth strategy — comp should reflect this strategic importance."
3. **AI Company Alternatives:** "ML/AI engineers at OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind earn $350K-$600K TC with equity. BCG needs to offer competitive cash comp to attract talent from the AI company talent pool."
4. **Client Revenue Attribution:** "Each BCG X AI engagement generates $5M-$20M in fees. My production ML work is what converts AI strategy into delivered AI products — the delta between a $5M pitch deck and a $20M delivered system."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I bring production ML expertise that converts BCG X's AI strategy into delivered client outcomes. I need $230K base with a 35% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $35K signing bonus. My AI company offers are at $370K-$450K TC with equity." BCG will counter at $205K-$220K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $320K.
