**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at BCG coordinate complex multi-team engineering programs — BCG X product launches, platform migrations, security initiatives, and technology transformation efforts. The BCG TPM role is unique because you're managing programs that span engineering teams, design teams, and consulting partner stakeholders. You need to align technical execution with the firm's partnership culture and client engagement timelines. BCG does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (25-45%). TPMs who successfully deliver high-visibility programs earn bonuses at the top of the range. BCG has been hiring experienced TPMs from FAANG to bring program management rigor to BCG X's growing engineering organization. [Source: BCG X Program Management 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** BCG TPM = Google L5 TPM = Meta E5 TPM = Amazon Sr. TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Program Delivery Impact:** "I manage programs with $10M-$40M in combined engineering investment. Successful delivery of these programs directly determines BCG X's reputation and client retention."
2. **Cross-Functional Complexity:** "BCG's TPM role requires coordinating engineering, design, consulting partners, and client stakeholders. This multi-dimensional stakeholder management is more complex than typical tech company TPM roles."
3. **Client Timeline Accountability:** "BCG X programs have hard client deadlines — not internal soft targets. My program management directly determines whether BCG meets contractual commitments."
4. **No-Equity Adjustment:** "TPMs at Google, Meta, and Amazon earn $290K-$400K TC with equity. BCG's cash structure needs to be competitive for experienced program management talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm driving delivery of BCG X's most critical cross-team programs. I need $215K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $30K signing bonus. My tech alternatives offer $310K-$380K TC with equity." BCG will counter at $190K-$205K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $290K.
