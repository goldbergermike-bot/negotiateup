### Senior Software Engineer | BCG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (30-50%) | No Equity | BCG X Technical Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boston | $180K-$215K | None | $54K-$108K (30-50%) | $234K-$323K |
| New York | $185K-$220K | None | $56K-$110K (30-50%) | $241K-$330K |
| London | £120K-£155K | None | £36K-£78K (30-50%) | £156K-£233K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at BCG lead technical design and architecture for BCG X client projects and the firm's internal technology platforms. At this level, you're expected to own technical decisions, mentor junior engineers, and interface with BCG partners on technology strategy for client engagements. BCG does not offer equity; comp is entirely base + performance bonus (30-50%). Senior engineers who are embedded in BCG X and deliver directly on client engagements tend to earn bonuses at the top of the range because their work is directly tied to billable revenue. BCG has been investing heavily in its senior technical talent pipeline, recognizing that experienced engineers are the key differentiator in competitive pitches for technology implementation work.

**Level Mapping:** BCG Senior Software Engineer = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Amazon SDE III

**Global Levers**

1. **Client Billing Leverage:** "Senior engineers at BCG X are billed at $400-$600/hour to clients. At 1,200+ billable hours, I generate $480K-$720K in direct revenue. My compensation represents a fraction of this revenue contribution."
2. **Technical Leadership Premium:** "At this level, my architectural decisions shape the quality and scalability of BCG X deliverables. Poor technical decisions cost the firm millions in rework; strong decisions accelerate delivery and client satisfaction."
3. **FAANG Gap Closure:** "Senior engineers at FAANG earn $350K-$450K TC with equity. BCG needs to offer $300K+ in cash comp (base + guaranteed bonus) to be competitive for experienced technical talent."
4. **GenAI Expertise Premium:** "If I bring GenAI/LLM production experience, that skill commands a 15-25% premium in the market. BCG X's GenAI practice needs senior engineers who can deploy, not just prototype."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm leading technical delivery for BCG X's highest-value engagements. I need $215K base with a 35% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $35K signing bonus. My FAANG offers are at $380K-$420K TC." BCG will counter at $195K-$205K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $305K.
