### Engineering Manager | BCG Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (30-50%) | No Equity | BCG X Delivery Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boston | $200K-$250K | None | $60K-$125K (30-50%) | $260K-$375K |
| New York | $205K-$260K | None | $62K-$130K (30-50%) | $267K-$390K |
| London | £130K-£175K | None | £39K-£88K (30-50%) | £169K-£263K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at BCG lead teams of 8-15 engineers delivering BCG X client projects and building the firm's internal technology platforms. The BCG EM role is uniquely demanding: you manage engineering teams while also navigating the firm's partnership culture and maintaining relationships with senior consulting partners who sponsor technology engagements. BCG X EMs are directly accountable for client engagement delivery — not just team health and technical quality. Bonus at this level ranges 30-50%, with client-facing EMs earning at the top. BCG has invested heavily in building its engineering management capability, hiring experienced tech leaders from FAANG and growth-stage companies. [Source: BCG X Engineering Management 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** BCG Engineering Manager = Google L6 EM = Meta E6 EM = Amazon SDM II

**Global Levers**

1. **Consulting Partner Parity:** "Engineering Managers at BCG have equivalent responsibility to Principals on the consulting track ($350K-$500K TC). Both lead teams and deliver client outcomes. My comp should approach that range."
2. **Team Revenue Ownership:** "My team delivers BCG X engagements worth $10M-$30M annually. I'm directly accountable for the quality and timeliness of these deliverables."
3. **Talent Retention Impact:** "The #1 factor in whether BCG X engineers stay or leave is their Engineering Manager. My effectiveness directly reduces the $200K+ cost of replacing each engineer who leaves."
4. **Signing Bonus + Guaranteed Bonus:** "I need a $40K signing bonus and a guaranteed first-year bonus of 35%. This compensates for the equity I'm leaving behind and reflects the dual consulting/engineering nature of this role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm leading engineering teams that deliver BCG X's highest-value client engagements. I need $250K base with a 35% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $45K signing bonus. My tech alternatives offer $400K-$500K TC with equity." BCG will counter at $225K-$240K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $350K.
