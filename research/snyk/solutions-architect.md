#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Snyk

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch expanded the company's enterprise go-to-market motion significantly. Solutions Architects are the technical leaders who translate the Security Fabric's capabilities into customer-specific deployment architectures. You work alongside enterprise sales teams to design implementations that integrate Snyk into complex CI/CD pipelines, SCM systems, and cloud environments — all while addressing the 48% insecurity rate of AI-generated code that is top-of-mind for every CISO.

The Secure at Inception philosophy for Solutions Architects means designing deployments where security scanning is deeply embedded in the customer's development lifecycle from day one. You do not sell a tool — you design a security transformation. Your reference architectures, proof-of-concept implementations, and technical presentations directly influence whether enterprise customers choose Snyk over competitors.

Solutions Architects at Snyk command a premium because they must combine deep technical expertise with customer-facing communication skills. You need to understand Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, container registries, IDE integrations, and application security concepts — then explain these clearly to technical and non-technical stakeholders alike.
