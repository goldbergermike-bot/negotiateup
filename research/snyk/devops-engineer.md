### DevOps Engineer — Snyk Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: As a DevOps Engineer at Snyk, you automate the Security Fabric deployment pipeline and embed the Secure at Inception standard into every CI/CD workflow — your infrastructure decisions define how security scales.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Boston (USD) | London (GBP £) | Tel Aviv (ILS ₪) |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $150,000–$190,000 | £70,000–£90,000 | ₪400,000–₪530,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $195,000–$265,000 | £95,000–£130,000 | ₪530,000–₪720,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $250,000–$340,000 | £120,000–£165,000 | ₪650,000–₪900,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, stock options (4-year vest with 1-year cliff), and performance bonus. Snyk is a private company (~$7.4B valuation), so equity is granted as Options, not RSUs.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Snyk

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch required massive infrastructure investment, and DevOps Engineers are the backbone of that investment. You build and maintain the CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration systems, and deployment infrastructure that enable Snyk to scan billions of lines of code — including the 48% of AI-generated code that ships with vulnerabilities. Your work ensures that Snyk's platform is available, performant, and secure at global scale.

The Secure at Inception philosophy for DevOps means infrastructure-as-code security. You ensure that every Terraform module, Kubernetes manifest, and Helm chart deployed at Snyk passes automated security validation. You practice what Snyk preaches — using Snyk's own IaC scanning tools to secure the infrastructure that powers the platform.

DevOps Engineers at Snyk command a premium because they operate the infrastructure for a security company. The bar for reliability, security, and compliance is dramatically higher than at a typical SaaS company. Any downtime or security incident in Snyk's infrastructure directly undermines customer trust in the platform's security capabilities.

#### Snyk Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Snyk Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| DevOps Engineer | IC3 | 2-4 years |
| Senior DevOps Engineer | IC4 | 4-7 years |
| Staff DevOps Engineer | IC5 | 7-11 years |
| Principal DevOps Engineer | IC6 | 11+ years |

### 🧬 Snyk Security Fabric & Secure at Inception Lever

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch addresses the crisis of 48% insecure AI-generated code. As a DevOps Engineer, you build the infrastructure that runs the Security Fabric at scale. Every scan, every vulnerability check, every remediation recommendation flows through the infrastructure you design and maintain. Without reliable, scalable DevOps, the Security Fabric cannot serve its millions of users.

The Secure at Inception framework for DevOps is about leading by example. You deploy Snyk's infrastructure using Snyk's own tools — IaC scanning, container security, open source dependency checks — and you ensure that every pipeline enforces automated security gates. The 48% insecurity rate of AI-gen code also affects infrastructure code, and your pipelines must catch IaC vulnerabilities generated by AI coding assistants.

When negotiating, emphasize that the February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch increased infrastructure complexity significantly. The Security Fabric processes more data, serves more users, and integrates with more platforms than any previous Snyk product. Your ability to scale this infrastructure while maintaining security and reliability is essential.

Frame your negotiation: "I operate the infrastructure that powers the Security Fabric and enforce Secure at Inception standards in every deployment pipeline. With 48% of AI-generated code containing vulnerabilities, my infrastructure security practices ensure that Snyk's own platform is a model of the security standard we sell."

#### Global Lever 1: Developer Security Platform

DevOps Engineers ensure Snyk's platform maintains five-nines availability. Negotiation language: "I operate the infrastructure that serves millions of developer security scans daily — my reliability engineering directly impacts customer trust and platform adoption."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Code Security

AI code security scanning requires significant compute and storage infrastructure. Negotiation language: "I build the scalable infrastructure for AI code security scanning — handling the increased compute demands created by the 48% insecurity rate in AI-generated code."

#### Global Lever 3: Open Source Vulnerability Intelligence

The vulnerability database requires high-availability data infrastructure. Negotiation language: "I operate the data infrastructure for Snyk's proprietary vulnerability database — ensuring real-time availability and sub-second query performance for global users."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise DevSecOps Adoption

Enterprise customers require SOC 2, ISO 27001, and FedRAMP-compliant infrastructure. Negotiation language: "I maintain the compliance-certified infrastructure that enables Snyk's enterprise customer deployments — SOC 2, ISO 27001, and regional data residency requirements."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $245,000 base with 75,000 Options. Accept-at floor: $260,000 total comp. Cite the February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch, the 48% AI-gen code insecurity crisis, and your Secure at Inception expertise. For London, anchor at £120,000 base. For Tel Aviv, anchor at ₪670,000 base.
