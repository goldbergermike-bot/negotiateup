#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Snyk

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch elevated the Security Engineer role to its most critical position in the company. You are the domain expert whose vulnerability research, threat modeling, and security analysis directly powers the products Snyk sells. When customers ask whether Snyk can detect the 48% of AI-generated code that ships with vulnerabilities, it is your research and detection rules that provide the answer.

The Secure at Inception philosophy is native to Security Engineers — you live and breathe it. You write the detection rules, design the scanning algorithms, and curate the vulnerability intelligence that makes Snyk's platform effective. With AI-generated code introducing novel vulnerability patterns, your ability to reverse-engineer AI-specific security flaws and build detection capabilities is mission-critical.

Security Engineers at Snyk command among the highest premiums in the organization because they represent the company's core domain expertise. Every other role at Snyk supports the work Security Engineers do. Your knowledge of CVEs, CWEs, attack vectors, and remediation strategies is literally the product.

### 🧬 Snyk Security Fabric & Secure at Inception Lever

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch addresses the crisis of 48% insecure AI-generated code. As a Security Engineer, you are the expert who understands why that 48% statistic exists — what classes of vulnerabilities AI coding assistants introduce, how they differ from human-written bugs, and what detection strategies are most effective against them. Your research directly shapes the Security Fabric's scanning capabilities.

The Secure at Inception framework is your domain. You define what "secure" means in the context of AI-generated code. You write the rules that distinguish safe code from vulnerable code, and you continuously update these rules as new AI-specific vulnerability patterns emerge. The 48% insecurity rate of AI-gen code is not just a statistic you cite — it is a problem you actively work to reduce through better detection, more accurate analysis, and smarter remediation guidance.

When negotiating, emphasize that you are not a support function — you are the product. The February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch unified Snyk's scanning capabilities, and every scanning engine relies on your vulnerability research and detection rules to function. Without Security Engineers, Snyk is a developer tool company. With Security Engineers, Snyk is a security company.

Frame your negotiation: "I power the Security Fabric with the vulnerability research and detection capabilities that make Secure at Inception possible. With 48% of AI-generated code containing vulnerabilities, my research into AI-specific vulnerability patterns is the foundation of Snyk's competitive advantage."

#### Global Lever 1: Developer Security Platform

Security Engineers write the detection rules and vulnerability advisories that power Snyk's scanning engines. Negotiation language: "I write the detection rules that power every scan Snyk performs — my security research is the core intellectual property that differentiates the platform."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Code Security

Security Engineers are on the front lines of understanding how AI-generated code introduces novel vulnerability patterns. Negotiation language: "I research AI-generated code vulnerability patterns — building detection capabilities for the 48% of AI-gen code that ships with security flaws."

#### Global Lever 3: Open Source Vulnerability Intelligence

Security Engineers curate, verify, and enrich Snyk's proprietary vulnerability database. Negotiation language: "I curate Snyk's vulnerability intelligence database — analyzing, verifying, and enriching thousands of vulnerabilities with severity assessments and remediation guidance."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise DevSecOps Adoption

Enterprise customers rely on Snyk's security expertise for threat modeling and compliance guidance. Negotiation language: "I provide the security domain expertise that enterprise customers rely on — threat modeling, compliance guidance, and security architecture reviews that justify Snyk's enterprise positioning."
