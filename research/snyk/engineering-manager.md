#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Snyk

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch placed enormous execution demands on engineering leadership. Engineering Managers at Snyk are responsible for recruiting, retaining, and empowering the engineers who build the platform addressing the 48% insecurity rate of AI-generated code. This is not a coordination role — it is a force-multiplier leadership position that directly impacts Snyk's ability to deliver on its most critical strategic initiative.

The Secure at Inception philosophy requires Engineering Managers to build a culture of security-first development. You establish team processes, code review standards, and quality gates that ensure every line of code — whether human-written or AI-generated — meets Snyk's security standards. Your ability to attract and develop top-tier security engineering talent is directly tied to the company's competitive advantage.

Engineering Managers at Snyk are particularly valuable because they must bridge deep technical understanding of developer security with the people leadership skills needed to build high-performing teams across Boston, London, and Tel Aviv. The distributed, multi-office nature of Snyk's engineering organization demands managers who can drive alignment across time zones and cultures.

### 🧬 Snyk Security Fabric & Secure at Inception Lever

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch addresses the crisis of 48% insecure AI-generated code. As an Engineering Manager, you are the operational leader who translates the Security Fabric vision into shipped product. You own the execution plan, manage the cross-functional dependencies, and ensure your teams deliver high-quality security features at the pace the market demands.

The Secure at Inception framework requires Engineering Managers to embed security into every aspect of their team's workflow. This means hiring engineers with security mindsets, establishing security-focused code review practices, and building CI/CD pipelines that enforce automated security validation for all code, including AI-generated code.

When negotiating, emphasize that the February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch elevated the Engineering Manager role from team-level execution to platform-level coordination. You manage teams that span multiple product areas within the Security Fabric, and your leadership directly determines whether Snyk can execute on its most important strategic bets.

Frame your negotiation: "I lead the teams building the Security Fabric and enforce the Secure at Inception standard across my organization. With 48% of AI-generated code containing vulnerabilities, my ability to recruit, develop, and retain top security engineering talent is directly tied to Snyk's competitive position."

#### Global Lever 1: Developer Security Platform

Engineering Managers own the delivery of Snyk's core scanning and remediation capabilities. Negotiation language: "I lead the team delivering Snyk's highest-usage product features — my execution cadence directly impacts developer adoption and retention metrics."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Code Security

Managing the AI code security team requires both technical depth and product intuition. The 48% vulnerability rate in AI-generated code creates urgency. Negotiation language: "I lead the AI code security initiative — Snyk's most strategically important new product area since the February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch."

#### Global Lever 3: Open Source Vulnerability Intelligence

Engineering Managers overseeing the vulnerability intelligence team manage some of Snyk's most critical proprietary infrastructure. Negotiation language: "I manage the team that curates and delivers Snyk's proprietary vulnerability database — this is the foundational data asset that differentiates the entire platform."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise DevSecOps Adoption

Enterprise engineering teams require managers who understand compliance, governance, and large-scale deployment challenges. Negotiation language: "I lead the enterprise platform team that enables Snyk's largest customer deployments — my team's work directly impacts the company's highest-value contracts."
