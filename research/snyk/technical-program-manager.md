#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Snyk

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch was a multi-quarter, multi-team program that required exceptional program management to deliver. Technical Program Managers at Snyk orchestrate the cross-functional execution that brings complex platform initiatives from vision to production. With the 48% insecurity rate of AI-generated code driving urgency across the product roadmap, TPMs are the connective tissue that ensures engineering, product, design, and security research teams execute in concert.

The Secure at Inception philosophy for TPMs means building program structures that embed security reviews, threat modeling sessions, and compliance checkpoints into every project milestone. You do not add security as an afterthought — you design programs where security validation is a first-class gate at every stage. Your program management methodology directly impacts whether Snyk can ship secure features at competitive speed.

Technical Program Managers at Snyk command a premium because they manage programs that span Boston, London, and Tel Aviv — three time zones, three cultures, and three regulatory environments. The complexity of coordinating global engineering teams on security-critical platform work requires TPMs with exceptional communication, organizational, and technical skills.

#### Snyk Level Mapping & Internal Titles

### 🧬 Snyk Security Fabric & Secure at Inception Lever

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch addresses the crisis of 48% insecure AI-generated code. As a Technical Program Manager, you are the person who made the launch happen on schedule. You coordinated the dependencies between scanning engines, vulnerability databases, developer integrations, and enterprise features to deliver a unified platform on time.

The Secure at Inception framework for TPMs means every program you run includes explicit security milestones. Threat modeling is a kickoff requirement. Security review is a launch gate. Compliance certification is a post-launch deliverable. The 48% insecurity rate of AI-gen code means your programs must move fast to deliver AI security features — but never at the expense of the quality and security standards Snyk is known for.

When negotiating, emphasize the scope and complexity of post-February 3, 2026 Security Fabric programs. The launch expanded Snyk's platform surface area significantly, and every subsequent feature release requires more coordination, more cross-team dependencies, and more rigorous program management.

Frame your negotiation: "I orchestrate the Security Fabric delivery programs and enforce Secure at Inception gates across every milestone. With 48% of AI-generated code containing vulnerabilities, my program management ensures Snyk ships AI security features at the speed the market demands without compromising quality."

#### Global Lever 1: Developer Security Platform

TPMs manage the delivery cadence for Snyk's core platform features. Negotiation language: "I orchestrate the cross-functional delivery of Snyk's core platform — managing dependencies across 10+ engineering teams to ship features on a predictable cadence."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Code Security

AI code security programs require rapid iteration and novel development processes. Negotiation language: "I manage the AI code security program — coordinating ML research, engineering, and product teams to deliver features that address the 48% vulnerability rate in AI-generated code."

#### Global Lever 3: Open Source Vulnerability Intelligence

Intelligence platform programs span data engineering, security research, and product teams. Negotiation language: "I manage the vulnerability intelligence platform program — coordinating data pipelines, research workflows, and product delivery across three global offices."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise DevSecOps Adoption

Enterprise programs require compliance certifications, customer advisory boards, and phased rollouts. Negotiation language: "I manage enterprise compliance and certification programs — SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP — that directly enable Snyk's largest customer deals."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $240,000 base with 70,000 Options. Accept-at floor: $255,000 total comp. Cite the February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch, the 48% AI-gen code insecurity crisis, and your Secure at Inception expertise. For London, anchor at £115,000 base. For Tel Aviv, anchor at ₪660,000 base.
