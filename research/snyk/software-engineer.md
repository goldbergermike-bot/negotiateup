#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Snyk

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch fundamentally changed how developer security platforms operate. As a Software Engineer, you are building the core platform that addresses the alarming reality that 48% of AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities. This is not incremental product work — it is foundational infrastructure that protects millions of developers worldwide.

The Secure at Inception philosophy means that every Software Engineer at Snyk is expected to embed security into the development lifecycle from the very first line of code. With AI-generated code proliferating across enterprises, Snyk's platform must catch vulnerabilities before they ever reach production. Your ability to build robust, scalable, and secure systems is directly tied to the company's competitive moat.

Software Engineers at Snyk operate at the intersection of developer tooling and cybersecurity — a talent market where demand far outstrips supply. The February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch expanded Snyk's addressable market significantly, and the company needs engineers who can ship at speed while maintaining the security-first culture that defines the brand.

### 🧬 Snyk Security Fabric & Secure at Inception Lever

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch addresses the crisis of 48% insecure AI-generated code. As a Software Engineer, you should negotiate as a builder of this critical platform. The Security Fabric unifies Snyk's scanning, monitoring, and remediation capabilities into a single developer-first experience, and you are the engineer making it real.

The Secure at Inception framework requires that AI-generated code is validated, scanned, and remediated before it ever merges. This is a paradigm shift from the legacy "scan after deploy" model. Your expertise in building these preventive systems positions you as a force multiplier for Snyk's entire product suite.

When negotiating, anchor to the fact that the Security Fabric is Snyk's flagship initiative post-February 3, 2026 launch. Every engineer contributing to this platform is working on the company's highest-priority investment. The 48% insecurity rate of AI-gen code is a crisis-level statistic that validates the urgency and strategic importance of your work.

Frame your negotiation around impact: "I build the Security Fabric that ensures AI-generated code is Secure at Inception. With 48% of AI-gen code shipping with vulnerabilities, my work directly protects Snyk's customers and drives platform adoption."

#### Global Lever 1: Developer Security Platform

Snyk is the market leader in developer-first security. As a Software Engineer, you build the core scanning and remediation engines that developers interact with daily. Negotiation language: "I contribute to the platform that secures code for over 2,500 enterprise customers. My engineering output directly impacts developer adoption and retention metrics."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Code Security

The 48% insecurity rate of AI-generated code is the defining challenge of modern application security. Snyk's AI code security capabilities, launched as part of the February 3, 2026 Security Fabric, are purpose-built to address this gap. Negotiation language: "I build AI code security features that address the 48% vulnerability rate in AI-generated code — this is Snyk's fastest-growing product vector."

#### Global Lever 3: Open Source Vulnerability Intelligence

Snyk maintains one of the most comprehensive open-source vulnerability databases in the industry. As a Software Engineer, you help build the ingestion, enrichment, and delivery pipelines that power this intelligence. Negotiation language: "I work on the vulnerability intelligence infrastructure that differentiates Snyk from every competitor — this is proprietary data moat work."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise DevSecOps Adoption

Enterprise customers are consolidating their security toolchains, and Snyk is positioned as the developer security platform of choice. Your work enables seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines and developer workflows. Negotiation language: "I build the integrations and platform capabilities that drive enterprise adoption and expansion revenue."
