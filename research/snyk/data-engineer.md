### Data Engineer — Snyk Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: As a Data Engineer at Snyk, you build the data infrastructure that powers the Security Fabric intelligence layer and enables the Secure at Inception framework with real-time vulnerability data pipelines — your pipelines are the nervous system of the platform.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Boston (USD) | London (GBP £) | Tel Aviv (ILS ₪) |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $150,000–$190,000 | £70,000–£90,000 | ₪400,000–₪530,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $195,000–$265,000 | £95,000–£130,000 | ₪530,000–₪720,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $250,000–$340,000 | £120,000–£165,000 | ₪650,000–₪900,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, stock options (4-year vest with 1-year cliff), and performance bonus. Snyk is a private company (~$7.4B valuation), so equity is granted as Options, not RSUs.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Snyk

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch dramatically increased the data engineering demands on the platform. Data Engineers at Snyk build the pipelines that ingest vulnerability data from thousands of sources, process billions of code analysis results, and deliver real-time security intelligence to developers. The 48% insecurity rate of AI-generated code means the volume and velocity of security data is growing exponentially, and your pipelines must scale to meet this demand.

The Secure at Inception philosophy for Data Engineers means building data infrastructure that is itself secure — encrypted at rest and in transit, access-controlled, audit-logged, and compliant with enterprise data governance requirements. You handle sensitive vulnerability data, customer code analysis results, and proprietary security intelligence, all of which require the highest standards of data protection.

Data Engineers at Snyk command a premium because they build the real-time data infrastructure that powers a security platform. The latency, reliability, and accuracy requirements for security data are far more demanding than typical analytics workloads. A missed vulnerability due to a pipeline failure is not a reporting delay — it is a potential security breach for Snyk's customers.

#### Snyk Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Snyk Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Data Engineer | DE3 | 2-4 years |
| Senior Data Engineer | DE4 | 4-7 years |
| Staff Data Engineer | DE5 | 7-11 years |
| Principal Data Engineer | DE6 | 11+ years |

### 🧬 Snyk Security Fabric & Secure at Inception Lever

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch addresses the crisis of 48% insecure AI-generated code. As a Data Engineer, you build the data backbone that makes the Security Fabric intelligent. Your pipelines process vulnerability feeds, code analysis telemetry, license compliance data, and container image metadata — unifying them into a coherent data platform that powers every Snyk product.

The Secure at Inception framework for data engineering means your pipelines enforce data quality gates that prevent stale or inaccurate vulnerability data from reaching customers. The 48% insecurity rate of AI-gen code creates new data streams — AI code analysis results, AI-specific vulnerability signatures, and AI coding assistant telemetry — that your pipelines must ingest, transform, and deliver at scale.

When negotiating, anchor to the criticality of your data infrastructure. The February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch unified multiple data streams into a single intelligence layer, and your pipelines are the foundation of that unification. Without reliable, low-latency data engineering, the Security Fabric cannot deliver accurate, timely security intelligence.

Frame your negotiation: "I build the data infrastructure that powers the Security Fabric intelligence layer and enables Secure at Inception with real-time vulnerability data. With 48% of AI-generated code containing vulnerabilities, my pipelines process the exploding volume of AI code security data that Snyk's customers depend on."

#### Global Lever 1: Developer Security Platform

Data Engineers build the event-driven data infrastructure that powers Snyk's scanning and remediation features. Negotiation language: "I build the real-time data pipelines that process billions of security events — my infrastructure directly powers Snyk's core scanning and remediation capabilities."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Code Security

AI code security generates massive new data streams that require specialized pipeline architecture. Negotiation language: "I build the data infrastructure for AI code security analysis — processing the new data streams generated by the 48% insecurity rate in AI-generated code."

#### Global Lever 3: Open Source Vulnerability Intelligence

Data Engineers power the ingestion and enrichment pipelines for Snyk's proprietary vulnerability database. Negotiation language: "I build the vulnerability intelligence data pipelines — ingesting, deduplicating, enriching, and delivering thousands of vulnerabilities daily from hundreds of sources worldwide."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise DevSecOps Adoption

Enterprise customers require data residency, data retention, and data governance capabilities. Negotiation language: "I build the enterprise data governance infrastructure — regional data residency, configurable retention policies, and audit logging — that enables Snyk's most compliance-sensitive customer deployments."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $245,000 base with 75,000 Options. Accept-at floor: $260,000 total comp. Cite the February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch, the 48% AI-gen code insecurity crisis, and your Secure at Inception expertise. For London, anchor at £120,000 base. For Tel Aviv, anchor at ₪670,000 base.
