*Total compensation includes base salary, stock options (4-year vest with 1-year cliff), and performance bonus. Snyk is a private company (~$7.4B valuation), so equity is granted as Options, not RSUs.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Snyk

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch was informed by deep data analysis — and Data Scientists at Snyk continue to power the intelligence that makes the platform effective. You build the models that detect vulnerability patterns, predict risk severity, and quantify the 48% insecurity rate of AI-generated code with granular, actionable precision. This is not traditional analytics — it is applied data science that directly improves security outcomes.

The Secure at Inception philosophy for Data Scientists means building predictive models that catch vulnerabilities before they reach production. You analyze code patterns, dependency graphs, and vulnerability databases to create scoring models that prioritize the riskiest code changes. With AI-generated code proliferating, your models must evolve to detect the unique vulnerability signatures that AI coding assistants introduce.

Data Scientists at Snyk command a premium because they require a rare blend of statistical rigor, machine learning expertise, and application security domain knowledge. Understanding vulnerability taxonomies, attack vectors, and code analysis requires deep specialization that traditional data science roles do not demand.

#### Snyk Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Snyk Internal Level | Typical YoE |

| Data Scientist | DS3 | 2-4 years |
| Senior Data Scientist | DS4 | 4-7 years |
| Staff Data Scientist | DS5 | 7-11 years |
| Principal Data Scientist | DS6 | 11+ years |

### 🧬 Snyk Security Fabric & Secure at Inception Lever

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch addresses the crisis of 48% insecure AI-generated code. As a Data Scientist, you build the intelligence layer that makes the Security Fabric smart. Your models detect patterns across millions of code repositories, identify emerging vulnerability trends, and predict which code changes carry the highest security risk.

The Secure at Inception framework for data science means building models that operate in real-time within the developer workflow. When a developer writes or generates code, your models assess the risk profile instantly and surface actionable recommendations. The 48% insecurity rate of AI-gen code is a dataset you study, model, and ultimately help reduce through better predictive analytics and automated risk scoring.

When negotiating, emphasize that your models are the intelligence backbone of the Security Fabric. The February 3, 2026 launch was not just a product release — it was a data platform evolution. Your work directly powers the risk scoring, vulnerability prioritization, and remediation recommendations that differentiate Snyk from every competitor.

Frame your negotiation: "I build the predictive models that power the Security Fabric intelligence layer and enable Secure at Inception risk assessment. With 48% of AI-generated code containing vulnerabilities, my models are the first line of defense for Snyk's customers."

#### Global Lever 1: Developer Security Platform

Data Scientists optimize the scanning engine's accuracy and reduce false positives. Negotiation language: "I build the models that optimize Snyk's scanning accuracy — my work directly reduces false positive rates and increases developer trust in the platform."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Code Security

The 48% insecurity rate of AI-generated code is fundamentally a data science challenge. Negotiation language: "I model AI-generated code vulnerability patterns — building classifiers that detect AI-specific security flaws that traditional rule-based systems miss."

#### Global Lever 3: Open Source Vulnerability Intelligence

Data Scientists enrich Snyk's vulnerability database with severity predictions, exploitability scores, and remediation recommendations. Negotiation language: "I build the vulnerability intelligence models that enrich Snyk's proprietary database — my severity and exploitability predictions power every customer's prioritization decisions."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise DevSecOps Adoption

Enterprise customers need data-driven security dashboards and risk reports. Negotiation language: "I design the risk analytics that power enterprise security dashboards — CISOs rely on my models to quantify organizational risk and justify security investments."
