#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Snyk

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch was the product of deep, strategic product thinking — and Product Managers are at the center of this effort. You own the roadmap decisions that determine how Snyk addresses the 48% insecurity rate of AI-generated code, translating market insights and customer needs into product features that developers actually adopt.

The Secure at Inception philosophy for Product Managers means designing experiences where security is invisible and frictionless. You do not bolt security onto the developer workflow — you embed it so deeply that developers cannot ship insecure code even if they tried. With AI-generated code proliferating, your product vision must anticipate new classes of vulnerabilities and build proactive protection into the platform.

Product Managers at Snyk command a premium because they must possess a rare combination of technical depth in application security, empathy for the developer experience, and strategic business acumen. The developer security market is highly competitive, and Snyk's ability to maintain its leadership position depends on PMs who can out-think and out-execute the competition.
