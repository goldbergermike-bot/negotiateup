### ML/AI Engineer — Snyk Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: As an ML/AI Engineer at Snyk, you build the machine learning models that power the Security Fabric's automated vulnerability detection and make the Secure at Inception vision scalable — your models are the intelligence behind every security decision.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

*Total compensation includes base salary, stock options (4-year vest with 1-year cliff), and performance bonus. Snyk is a private company (~$7.4B valuation), so equity is granted as Options, not RSUs.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Snyk

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch placed ML/AI capabilities at the center of the platform's evolution. ML/AI Engineers at Snyk build the models that detect vulnerability patterns in code, predict risk severity, auto-generate remediation suggestions, and — most critically — identify the unique security flaws in the 48% of AI-generated code that ships with vulnerabilities. This is applied ML at the frontier of cybersecurity, not generic model training.

The Secure at Inception philosophy for ML/AI Engineers means building models that operate in real-time within the developer's IDE and CI/CD pipeline. When a developer writes or generates code, your models must assess its security posture instantly and provide actionable feedback before the code is committed. With AI-generated code proliferating, your models must understand the output patterns of AI coding assistants and detect the vulnerability signatures they commonly introduce.

ML/AI Engineers at Snyk command the highest premiums in the engineering organization because they combine three rare skill sets: machine learning expertise, code analysis capabilities, and security domain knowledge. The intersection of these disciplines is where Snyk's most differentiated features originate, and the talent pool is exceptionally shallow.

#### Snyk Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Snyk Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| ML/AI Engineer | ML3 | 2-5 years |
| Senior ML/AI Engineer | ML4 | 5-8 years |
| Staff ML/AI Engineer | ML5 | 8-12 years |
| Principal ML/AI Engineer | ML6 | 12+ years |

### 🧬 Snyk Security Fabric & Secure at Inception Lever

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch addresses the crisis of 48% insecure AI-generated code. As an ML/AI Engineer, you build the intelligent core of the Security Fabric. Your models analyze code patterns, detect vulnerability signatures, predict risk levels, and generate remediation recommendations — all in real-time, at scale, across every programming language and framework Snyk supports.

The Secure at Inception framework for ML/AI Engineers is about building models that understand code as a security artifact. AI-generated code has distinct statistical signatures — patterns of vulnerability introduction, dependency selection biases, and configuration weaknesses — that your models are trained to detect. The 48% insecurity rate of AI-gen code is not a monolithic problem; your models decompose it into specific vulnerability classes, each requiring tailored detection approaches.

When negotiating, emphasize that the February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch made ML/AI capabilities a first-class pillar of the platform. This is not an experimental ML team — it is a core engineering function that powers features used by millions of developers daily. Your models directly determine the accuracy and value of Snyk's security scanning.

Frame your negotiation: "I build the ML models that power the Security Fabric's intelligent vulnerability detection and enable Secure at Inception at scale. With 48% of AI-generated code containing vulnerabilities, my models are the automated frontline defense that Snyk's customers rely on to catch AI-introduced security flaws."

#### Global Lever 1: Developer Security Platform

ML/AI Engineers build the models that power Snyk's core scanning accuracy. Negotiation language: "I build the ML models that determine Snyk's scanning accuracy — my models directly impact false positive rates, detection coverage, and developer trust in the platform."

#### Global Lever 2: AI Code Security

ML/AI Engineers are uniquely positioned to address AI code security because they understand both the models that generate code and the models that secure it. Negotiation language: "I build AI-aware security models that detect the 48% of AI-generated code containing vulnerabilities — leveraging my understanding of both code generation and code security to build uniquely effective detection systems."

#### Global Lever 3: Open Source Vulnerability Intelligence

ML models enhance vulnerability intelligence with automated severity prediction, exploitability assessment, and remediation suggestion generation. Negotiation language: "I build the ML enrichment layer for Snyk's vulnerability database — automated severity scoring, exploitability prediction, and remediation generation that scales intelligence processing by orders of magnitude."

#### Global Lever 4: Enterprise DevSecOps Adoption

Enterprise customers need ML-powered risk scoring and compliance automation. Negotiation language: "I build the ML-powered risk scoring models that enterprise CISOs use to quantify and prioritize organizational security risk — directly enabling Snyk's enterprise value proposition."
