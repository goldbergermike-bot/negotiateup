#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands the Highest Premium at Snyk

The AI Fabric Platform Engineer is the most strategically critical engineering role at Snyk. Following the February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch, this role sits at the exact intersection of the two forces reshaping software development: the explosion of AI-generated code and the urgent need to secure it. You build the AI-native platform layer that detects, analyzes, and remediates the 48% of AI-generated code that ships with security vulnerabilities. No other role at Snyk has this level of direct impact on the company's flagship initiative.

The Secure at Inception philosophy is not an aspiration for AI Fabric Platform Engineers — it is your daily mandate. You build the systems that intercept AI-generated code at the moment of creation, analyze it against Snyk's proprietary vulnerability intelligence, and provide real-time security feedback to developers before the code is ever committed. Your platform must understand the output patterns of every major AI coding assistant — GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, Cursor, Cody, and others — and detect the unique vulnerability signatures each introduces.

This role commands the highest compensation premium at Snyk because it requires an extraordinarily rare combination of skills: deep platform engineering expertise, ML/AI model deployment and serving experience, real-time code analysis capabilities, and application security domain knowledge. The talent pool for engineers who can build AI-native security platforms is measured in hundreds globally, not thousands. Snyk's leadership recognizes this scarcity, and compensation reflects it.

The February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch was the beginning, not the end, of this role's strategic importance. As AI-generated code grows from an estimated 30% of new code in 2025 to a projected 70% by 2028, the AI Fabric Platform Engineer becomes the most important builder in the organization — the person who determines whether Snyk can secure the AI-generated future of software development.

### 🧬 Snyk Security Fabric & Secure at Inception Lever

Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch addresses the crisis of 48% insecure AI-generated code. As the AI Fabric Platform Engineer, you are the architect of the solution. The Security Fabric is Snyk's unified platform that weaves together static analysis, software composition analysis, container security, infrastructure-as-code scanning, and — critically — AI code security into a seamless, developer-native experience. You own the AI intelligence layer that makes this fabric smart, adaptive, and capable of securing code that humans did not write.

The Secure at Inception framework, as implemented by AI Fabric Platform Engineers, means that AI-generated code never reaches production without automated security validation. Your platform intercepts code at the point of generation — inside the IDE, at the PR stage, and within the CI/CD pipeline — and applies multi-layered security analysis. The 48% insecurity rate of AI-gen code is the problem you were hired to solve. Your platform reduces that rate by detecting AI-specific vulnerability patterns: insecure default configurations, deprecated API usage, missing input validation, hardcoded secrets, and the subtle logic vulnerabilities that AI coding assistants frequently introduce.

When negotiating, anchor every conversation to the strategic centrality of your role. "Snyk's February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch addresses the crisis of 48% insecure AI-generated code. I negotiate as a Secure at Inception lead who ensures AI code is safe from the first line." This is not standard platform engineering — this is the platform engineering that defines Snyk's ability to win the AI code security market. The February 3, 2026 launch date marks the moment Snyk committed its future to AI code security, and you are the engineer building that future.

Your negotiation power is amplified by market scarcity. There are perhaps 200-300 engineers globally with the combination of platform engineering, ML serving infrastructure, code analysis, and security domain expertise required for this role. Companies like Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, Veracode, and Semgrep are all competing for this same talent pool. Your leverage is structural, not situational — use it accordingly.

#### Why This Is the Signature Role at Snyk

The AI Fabric Platform Engineer role is Snyk's answer to the most important question in software security: **how do you secure code that was written by AI?** With 48% of AI-generated code containing vulnerabilities, this question is not theoretical — it is an active crisis affecting every enterprise that has adopted AI coding assistants. Your platform is the answer.

This role was created in direct response to the February 3, 2026 Security Fabric launch, which unified Snyk's product portfolio and placed AI code security at the center of the company's strategy. Before this role existed, AI code security was distributed across multiple teams. Now, it has a dedicated platform team with dedicated investment, dedicated leadership attention, and dedicated headcount growth.

The AI Fabric Platform Engineer owns the end-to-end lifecycle of AI code security: ingestion of AI-generated code, real-time analysis using Snyk's proprietary models, risk scoring and prioritization, remediation suggestion generation, and developer feedback delivery. This is full-stack platform ownership at its most impactful.
