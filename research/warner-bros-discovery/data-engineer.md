**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at WBD build the data infrastructure that powers content intelligence, subscriber analytics, and advertising optimization across Max, HBO, Warner Bros., and Discovery properties. With 100M+ Max subscribers generating billions of streaming events, plus extensive linear TV viewership data and content production analytics, WBD's data estate is rich and diverse. Data Engineers design the pipelines, warehouses, and real-time streaming architectures that transform this raw data into the intelligence driving content investment decisions (billions in annual spend), personalization algorithms, and advertising targeting.

WBD's data infrastructure modernization is ongoing — migrating from legacy media company systems to cloud-native data platforms that can support Max's growth and WBD's data-driven content strategy.

**Level Mapping:** WBD Data Engineer (L3-L5) = Google L3-L5 DE = Meta E3-E5 DE = Amazon DE II-III = Comcast T3-T5

**WBD Content Intelligence Premium**

WBD's data uniquely combines streaming viewership (Max), linear TV ratings (Discovery, CNN, TNT), theatrical box office (Warner Bros.), and content production data — enabling content valuation and audience analytics that no pure-play streamer can match. Data Engineers who build infrastructure connecting these data domains enable WBD to make smarter content investment decisions worth billions annually.

**Global Levers**

1. **Content Intelligence Infrastructure:** "I'll build the data platform that informs WBD's content investment decisions — billions in annual spending on HBO originals, Warner Bros. films, and Discovery programming. Better data infrastructure means better content ROI. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Multi-Domain Data Integration:** "WBD's unique data advantage comes from connecting streaming, linear TV, theatrical, and production data. My experience with cross-domain data pipelines at [company] directly supports this strategy. RSUs of $[Y]K reflect this expertise."

3. **Competing Data Platform Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Netflix/Snowflake/Databricks] at $[X]K total comp. WBD's multi-domain data opportunity is more interesting, but the compensation needs to be competitive within the media-tech tier."

4. **Data Modernization Acceleration:** "WBD's data infrastructure modernization is critical to Max's growth. My experience with [cloud-native data platforms] can accelerate this migration. Engineers driving data modernization command a premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. Building WBD's unified data platform — connecting streaming, linear, theatrical, and production data — is a compelling analytics challenge. To align with market rates: a base of $[X+8-12]K, RSU grant of $[Y+20-30]K, and a signing bonus of $[15-25]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[200-235]K, this reflects competitive media-tech rates for data engineering at scale. I'm ready to accept."
