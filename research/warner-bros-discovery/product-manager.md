**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at WBD own the strategy and roadmap for products that deliver HBO's prestige content, Warner Bros. films, and Discovery programming to 100M+ Max subscribers. Whether you're driving Max subscriber growth, defining the ad-supported tier experience, or building content discovery features, you sit at the intersection of technology, content strategy, and consumer experience at a company with one of the strongest content portfolios in entertainment.

WBD PMs have high ownership — at a $25B company, individual PMs have meaningful influence on product direction and direct access to senior leadership. The role offers the rare opportunity to shape a streaming platform during a critical growth phase, where product decisions have outsized impact on WBD's competitive positioning.

**Level Mapping:** WBD PM (P2-P4) = Google L4-L6 PM = Meta E4-E6 PM = Amazon PM L5-L7 = Netflix PM

**WBD Product Ownership Premium**

WBD PMs manage products for HBO — one of the most respected content brands in entertainment. Product decisions on Max don't just affect metrics — they determine how prestige content reaches audiences and how WBD competes in the streaming wars. PMs with strong product instincts who can leverage HBO's content advantage through superior product experiences are exceptionally valuable.

**Global Levers**

1. **Streaming Product Ownership:** "I'll own product strategy for Max during a critical growth phase. At WBD's scale, my product decisions directly shape the platform's competitive positioning. This high-ownership PM role warrants a base of $[X]K."

2. **Content Monetization Strategy:** "My product decisions will determine how WBD monetizes HBO content — subscription tiers, pricing, ad experiences, and content bundling. This revenue strategy ownership warrants RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Competing PM Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Netflix/Disney/Amazon] at $[X]K. WBD's high-ownership PM opportunity and HBO content advantage are compelling, but the package needs to be competitive within media-tech."

4. **Ad-Tier Product Revenue:** "Max's ad-supported tier is WBD's fastest-growing revenue stream. My product decisions on ad experience, ad load, and ad targeting directly impact advertising revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about owning Max product strategy — shaping how HBO's prestige content reaches 100M+ subscribers is a rare PM opportunity. To align with market rates: a base of $[170-185]K, RSU grant of $[100-120]K, and a signing bonus of $[20-30]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[225-255]K, this reflects the strategic product ownership and HBO content advantage. I'm ready to accept."
