### Max Streaming Engineer | Warner Bros Discovery Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $25B Media Company | Max (HBO) Streaming Platform | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+10-15% STREAMING PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / Los Angeles | $150K–$200K | $45K–$140K | 10-12% | $185K–$280K |
| Atlanta / Seattle | $140K–$190K | $40K–$130K | 10-12% | $170K–$260K |
| London (UK) | £110K–£148K | £30K–£100K | 10-12% | $140K–$210K |

**Negotiation DNA**

The Max Streaming Engineer is Warner Bros Discovery's signature technical role — building and scaling the streaming platform that delivers HBO's prestige content, Warner Bros. films, and Discovery's unscripted programming to 100M+ global subscribers. Max is the centerpiece of WBD's direct-to-consumer strategy and the company's primary vehicle for competing in the streaming wars against Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon. You are building the video delivery infrastructure, content recommendation engine, ad-serving systems, and playback services that determine whether Max can monetize the world's most acclaimed premium content library.

This role commands a 10-15% streaming premium over standard WBD engineering compensation because Max engineers require specialized expertise in video encoding, adaptive bitrate streaming, content delivery, and real-time personalization. WBD's $25B market cap creates a unique dynamic — the company has premium content (HBO) but operates with more financial discipline than larger competitors, meaning engineers who can build competitive streaming technology efficiently are exceptionally valuable.

**WBD Streaming Premium — Max's Strategic Imperative**

Max is not just a streaming service — it is the primary distribution platform for HBO, one of the most valuable content brands in entertainment. The quality of the Max streaming experience directly determines whether WBD can monetize its premium content library, which includes HBO originals, Warner Bros. theatrical releases, and Discovery's vast library. WBD has invested billions in Max, and the platform's growth, engagement, and ad-tier revenue are existential priorities. Engineers building Max are directly responsible for the success of WBD's most important strategic bet.

**Global Levers**

1. **Signature Role — HBO's Digital Future:** "I'm building the platform that delivers HBO — the most prestigious content brand in television — to global audiences. Max's engineering quality directly determines whether WBD can compete with Netflix and Disney+ for streaming dominance. This signature role warrants premium compensation reflecting its strategic importance."

2. **Streaming Talent Scarcity:** "Engineers with streaming platform expertise are recruited by Netflix ($190K-$350K+ all-cash), Disney+ ($170K-$355K TC), and Amazon Prime Video ($200K-$400K+ TC). WBD needs to be competitive for this talent pool, and I'd like to discuss increasing the RSU grant to $[X]K to close the gap."

3. **Premium Content Platform Responsibility:** "Max delivers HBO's prestige content — content that costs billions to produce. A poor streaming experience on Max doesn't just lose subscribers — it undermines the value of the most acclaimed content brand in entertainment. This premium content delivery responsibility justifies premium compensation."

4. **Ad-Tier Revenue Impact:** "Max's ad-supported tier is WBD's fastest-growing revenue stream. The ad-tech infrastructure I build — ad insertion, targeting, measurement — directly impacts WBD's advertising P&L. My engineering work has direct revenue attribution."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building Max — delivering HBO's prestige content through a world-class streaming experience is the kind of engineering challenge I want. I hold a competing offer from [Netflix/Disney+/Amazon] at $[X]K total comp. While I believe in Max's content advantage, I'd like to discuss: $[185K] base and $[125K] RSUs over four years. At $[250-280]K total comp, this reflects the streaming talent premium and the signature nature of this role. Max's success depends on engineering excellence — and I'm ready to deliver if we can align."
