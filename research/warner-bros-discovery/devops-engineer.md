### DevOps Engineer | Warner Bros Discovery Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $25B Media Company | Streaming Infrastructure Reliability | Max Platform Operations

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / Los Angeles | $125K–$170K | $28K–$105K | 10% | $148K–$228K |
| Atlanta / Seattle | $118K–$162K | $24K–$95K | 10% | $138K–$212K |
| London (UK) | £90K–£125K | £18K–£72K | 10% | $110K–$168K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at WBD ensure the reliability and performance of Max streaming infrastructure and WBD's broader digital platform. When Max streams an HBO premiere to millions of concurrent viewers or delivers live CNN coverage during a breaking news event, DevOps Engineers are ensuring flawless delivery. WBD's infrastructure spans AWS cloud environments, CDN infrastructure for global video delivery, and a complex microservices architecture supporting multiple streaming and digital properties.

WBD's DevOps transformation is central to Max's competitiveness — the platform must deliver Netflix-quality streaming reliability with more constrained resources. DevOps Engineers who can optimize infrastructure efficiency while maintaining reliability create outsized value at WBD's scale.

**Level Mapping:** WBD DevOps Engineer (L3-L5) = Google L3-L5 SRE = Amazon SDE II-III (Infrastructure) = Netflix SRE = Comcast T3-T5

**WBD Infrastructure Efficiency Premium**

WBD's infrastructure challenge is unique: deliver streaming quality that competes with Netflix and Disney+ while operating with the financial discipline of a $25B company (vs. Netflix at $300B+ and Disney at $200B+). DevOps Engineers who can maximize infrastructure efficiency — optimizing cloud spend, improving deployment velocity, and automating operations — directly impact WBD's streaming profitability and competitive positioning.

**Global Levers**

1. **Streaming Reliability at HBO Scale:** "Downtime during an HBO premiere or live event costs WBD millions in subscriber churn and brand damage. My reliability engineering track record of [X]% uptime at [company] directly protects Max's subscriber base. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Infrastructure Efficiency Value:** "WBD needs DevOps engineers who can deliver Netflix-quality reliability with greater efficiency. My experience optimizing cloud infrastructure costs by [X]% at [company] translates directly to Max's streaming profitability. RSUs of $[Y]K reflect this efficiency value."

3. **Competing Infrastructure Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [AWS/Google Cloud/Netflix] at $[X]K. WBD's streaming challenge is compelling, but the package needs to be competitive with cloud and streaming alternatives."

4. **Platform Modernization Impact:** "WBD's ongoing infrastructure modernization — containerization, CI/CD, observability — is critical to Max's ability to ship features quickly. My experience leading similar modernizations at [company] can accelerate this transformation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. WBD's infrastructure challenge — delivering HBO-quality streaming with optimized efficiency — is exactly the kind of problem I solve. To align with market rates: a base of $[X+8-10]K, RSU grant of $[Y+18-28]K, and a signing bonus of $[12-20]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[195-228]K, this reflects streaming reliability expertise and infrastructure optimization value. I'm ready to commit."
