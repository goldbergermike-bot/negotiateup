**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at WBD work at the intersection of entertainment, content strategy, and consumer analytics — building models that optimize content investment, personalize the Max streaming experience, and maximize advertising yield across WBD's portfolio. With HBO's prestige content, Warner Bros. theatrical releases, and Discovery's unscripted programming, WBD generates uniquely rich content performance data that enables content valuation models, audience segmentation, and cross-platform analytics at a scale that few media companies can match.

WBD has invested in data science to support content-driven decision making — informing which shows to greenlight, how to price subscription tiers, and how to optimize the ad-supported tier. Data Scientists who can translate viewership patterns into actionable content strategy are particularly valued.

**WBD Content Valuation Premium**

WBD's data science is uniquely tied to content investment decisions worth billions annually. A model that better predicts which HBO originals will drive subscriber growth directly influences greenlight decisions. A segmentation model that identifies high-value subscriber cohorts directly impacts retention strategy and marketing spend. Data Scientists at WBD are not building abstract analytics — they are building the intelligence that drives the content strategy for one of the world's premier entertainment companies.

**Global Levers**

1. **Content Investment Intelligence:** "My models will inform content investment decisions worth billions — which shows to greenlight, which content drives subscriber growth, and how to optimize content spend ROI. This direct impact on WBD's largest expenditure warrants a base of $[X]K."

2. **Cross-Platform Audience Analytics:** "WBD's data spans streaming, linear TV, theatrical, and digital — enabling cross-platform audience models that no pure streamer can build. My experience with multi-domain analytics at [company] directly supports this. RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Advertising Optimization Impact:** "Max's ad-supported tier depends on sophisticated audience targeting and yield optimization. My models will directly impact ad revenue — CPM rates, fill rates, and advertiser ROI. This revenue-generating analytical work commands premium compensation."

4. **Competing Analytics Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Netflix/Disney/Google] at $[X]K. WBD's content intelligence opportunity is compelling, but the package needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about applying data science to WBD's content strategy — informing billion-dollar content decisions and optimizing Max's subscriber experience is high-impact analytical work. To align with market rates: a base of $[165-180]K, RSU grant of $[95-115]K, and a signing bonus of $[15-25]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[215-245]K, this reflects the revenue impact and content intelligence scope. I'm ready to accept."
