### ML/AI Engineer | Warner Bros Discovery Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $25B Media Company | Content Intelligence & Personalization | **+10-15% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / Los Angeles | $140K–$195K | $38K–$130K | 10-12% | $170K–$270K |
| Atlanta / Seattle | $132K–$185K | $32K–$118K | 10-12% | $158K–$250K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at WBD build the intelligence systems that power content recommendation, personalization, advertising optimization, and content analytics across the Max streaming platform and WBD's broader portfolio. From recommending the next HBO show to 100M+ Max subscribers to optimizing ad targeting on the ad-supported tier to building content valuation models that inform billion-dollar greenlight decisions — ML touches every critical function at WBD.

The AI Premium of 10-15% reflects the talent scarcity for ML engineers with streaming and media domain expertise. WBD competes for this talent against Netflix, Google, Meta, and Amazon — all of which offer significantly higher total comp.

**Level Mapping:** WBD ML/AI Engineer (L4-L5) = Google L4-L5 ML = Meta E4-E5 ML = Amazon Applied Scientist II-III = Netflix ML Engineer

**WBD Content AI Premium**

WBD's ML applications uniquely span streaming personalization, content valuation, audience analytics, and advertising optimization. ML engineers who can apply AI to premium content strategy — determining which shows to recommend, how to maximize HBO's content value, and how to optimize the ad-content balance — directly influence WBD's most critical business decisions.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Talent Scarcity Premium:** "ML engineers with streaming and recommendation experience are among the most competitive hires in tech. My competing offers from [Google/Netflix/Meta] at $[X]K include AI premiums. WBD's offer should reflect this talent scarcity."

2. **Content Recommendation Revenue Impact:** "My recommendation models will directly impact Max subscriber retention — every 1% improvement in churn translates to millions in retained revenue. This direct P&L attribution warrants top-of-band compensation."

3. **Ad-Tech ML Revenue:** "Max's ad tier depends on ML-powered targeting and yield optimization. My models will directly determine CPM rates and ad revenue. This revenue-generating ML work commands premium compensation."

4. **Content Valuation Intelligence:** "My ML models will inform content investment decisions worth billions. Better content valuation models mean better ROI on WBD's largest expenditure. This strategic impact warrants RSUs of $[Y]K."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "The ML opportunity at WBD is compelling — applying AI to HBO content strategy, Max personalization, and advertising optimization is high-impact work. I hold a competing offer from [Google/Netflix] at $[X]K including an AI premium. To make WBD competitive: $[180-195]K base, $[110-130]K RSUs, and a $[20-30]K signing bonus. At $[240-270]K, this reflects the AI talent premium and multi-domain ML impact at WBD. I'm ready to commit."
