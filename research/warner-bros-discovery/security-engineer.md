**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at WBD protect some of the most valuable entertainment intellectual property in the world — unreleased HBO originals, Warner Bros. theatrical releases, and Discovery's content library — alongside the personal data of 100M+ Max subscribers. WBD's security challenges span content protection (DRM, anti-piracy), application security for Max streaming, consumer data protection (payment, PII), and corporate security for a global media organization.

Content security is particularly critical at WBD because HBO content leaks generate outsized media attention and can materially impact viewership and advertising revenue. Security Engineers who protect pre-release content and ensure Max's platform security are directly protecting WBD's most valuable assets.

**WBD Content Security Premium**

WBD's security requirements are amplified by the high-profile nature of its content. An HBO content leak generates global media coverage and can cost tens of millions in lost viewership impact. This high-stakes content protection, combined with standard application and data security requirements for 100M+ subscribers, creates a dual-domain security challenge that demands specialized expertise.

**Global Levers**

1. **Premium Content Protection:** "I'll protect unreleased HBO originals, Warner Bros. films, and Discovery content — IP worth billions. Content leaks at WBD generate outsized business and media impact. This premium protection responsibility warrants a base of $[X]K."

2. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Cybersecurity talent with both content protection (DRM, anti-piracy) and application security expertise is exceptionally rare. My experience in [both domains] positions me uniquely for WBD's dual-domain security needs."

3. **Consumer Data Protection Scale:** "Protecting PII and payment data for 100M+ Max subscribers requires enterprise-scale security engineering. My experience securing consumer platforms at [company] translates directly."

4. **Competing Security Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto/Netflix] at $[X]K. WBD's dual content-consumer security challenge is compelling, but the compensation needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Protecting HBO's content and Max's subscriber data is a security challenge I'm passionate about. To align with market rates: a base of $[168-182]K, RSU grant of $[95-115]K, and a signing bonus of $[18-28]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[220-250]K, this reflects security talent scarcity and the premium IP protection responsibility. I'm ready to defend WBD's assets."
