**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at WBD are the technical leaders who own architecture and implementation for systems serving 100M+ Max subscribers and WBD's broader digital portfolio. At this level, you drive technical decisions for Max streaming features, HBO digital content delivery, or Discovery's content management systems. WBD's Senior SWEs are expected to combine deep technical expertise with product impact — owning systems end-to-end and mentoring junior engineers while delivering complex features at streaming scale.

WBD's Senior SWE compensation has improved significantly as the company competes for streaming engineering talent. Total comp of $185K-$280K is competitive within the media-tech tier and reflects WBD's recognition that retaining senior technical talent is critical to Max's success.

**Level Mapping:** WBD Senior SWE (L5) = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Amazon SDE III = Netflix Senior SWE = Comcast T5 = Disney IC4

**WBD Senior Engineering Premium**

Senior SWEs at WBD have outsized influence because the company's engineering organization is more compact than Big Tech. A Senior SWE at WBD might own an entire streaming subsystem — content delivery, playback, recommendations, or ad-tech — with direct visibility to engineering leadership and meaningful influence on product direction. This level of ownership and impact is typically reserved for Staff-level engineers at larger companies.

**Global Levers**

1. **Senior-Level System Ownership:** "At WBD, Senior SWEs own entire streaming subsystems — not just features within a larger team. This end-to-end ownership and architectural responsibility is equivalent to Staff-level scope at larger companies, and the compensation should reflect this at $[X]K base."

2. **Premium Content Technical Leadership:** "I'll provide senior technical leadership for the platform delivering HBO's prestige content. The technical quality of Max directly determines subscriber retention and content value realization. This premium content responsibility warrants RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Streaming Market Counter-Offers:** "I have competing offers from [Netflix/Disney+/Amazon] at the Senior level with total comp of $[X]K. While WBD's individual impact and premium content opportunity are compelling, the package needs to be competitive within the media-tech tier."

4. **Compact Organization Leverage:** "WBD's engineering organization is more compact than Big Tech, meaning Senior SWEs have direct access to leadership and outsized influence on technical direction. I'd like the compensation to reflect this elevated scope."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the Senior SWE role — owning streaming architecture for Max and HBO's digital future is exactly the kind of high-ownership technical challenge I want. To align with media-tech market rates: a base of $[185-200]K, RSU grant of $[120-140]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[25-35]K. My competing offer is $[X]K. At $[250-280]K, this reflects senior-level ownership and the premium content platform opportunity. I'm ready to commit."
