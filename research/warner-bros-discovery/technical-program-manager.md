**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at WBD orchestrate delivery of complex technology programs across Max streaming, HBO digital, Warner Bros. content systems, and Discovery platforms. When WBD launches a new Max feature to 100M+ subscribers, integrates legacy systems from the Warner-Discovery merger, or rolls out ad-tier capabilities globally — a TPM drives the program. The role demands technical literacy combined with exceptional coordination skills, navigating engineering, product, content, and business stakeholders across a complex post-merger organization.

WBD's organizational complexity — stemming from the 2022 merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery — creates unique program management challenges. Systems integration, cultural alignment, and technology rationalization are ongoing priorities that require skilled TPMs.

**Level Mapping:** WBD TPM (L4-L6) = Google L4-L6 TPM = Meta E4-E6 TPM = Amazon TPM L5-L7 = Netflix TPM

**WBD Integration Program Premium**

WBD TPMs operate in a post-merger environment where system integration, platform consolidation, and organizational alignment create program complexity that exceeds typical streaming companies. TPMs who can navigate this complexity — coordinating across legacy HBO Max teams, Discovery+ teams, and new unified Max teams — bring high-value organizational navigation skills.

**Global Levers**

1. **Post-Merger Integration Complexity:** "WBD's post-merger environment creates program management complexity that exceeds typical tech companies — integrating legacy systems, aligning teams, and rationalizing platforms. My experience navigating similar transformations at [company] is directly valuable."

2. **Streaming Program Delivery:** "Launching features for 100M+ Max subscribers requires flawless program management across engineering, product, and content teams. My delivery track record at [company] demonstrates this capability."

3. **Competing TPM Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/Netflix] at $[X]K for a TPM role. WBD's integration complexity is more compelling, but the compensation needs to be competitive."

4. **Cross-Organization Navigation:** "WBD's matrixed organization requires TPMs who can coordinate across engineering, content, and business stakeholders — often with competing priorities. This organizational navigation skill is rare and valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "WBD's TPM challenge is compelling — navigating post-merger complexity while delivering Max features to 100M+ subscribers requires exactly my skill set. To align with market rates: a base of $[170-185]K, RSU grant of $[100-120]K, and a signing bonus of $[18-28]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[225-255]K, this reflects the organizational complexity and streaming delivery scope. I'm ready to drive WBD's programs."
