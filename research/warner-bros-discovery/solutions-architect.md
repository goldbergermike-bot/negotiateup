**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at WBD design the technical architecture connecting Max streaming, HBO digital, Warner Bros. content systems, and Discovery's programming platforms. This role requires deep technical expertise in streaming architecture, content delivery, and media technology — combined with the ability to translate WBD's content and business strategy into scalable technical designs. Whether you're architecting Max's global streaming infrastructure, designing content management workflows, or building integration patterns across WBD's acquired properties, you shape the technical foundation of WBD's digital future.

At a $25B company, Solutions Architects have significant influence — your architectural recommendations directly shape WBD's technology investments and competitive positioning in the streaming market.

**Level Mapping:** WBD Solutions Architect (L5-L6) = Google Cloud Architect L5-L6 = AWS Solutions Architect (Senior/Principal) = Comcast T5-T6

**WBD Architecture Efficiency Premium**

WBD's Solutions Architects must design streaming architecture that competes with platforms backed by $200B+ companies — while doing so with greater resource efficiency. Architects who can make smart build-vs-buy decisions, leverage cloud services effectively, and design for scalability with constrained budgets create outsized value at WBD.

**Global Levers**

1. **Streaming Architecture Authority:** "I'll design Max's streaming architecture — the platform that must compete with Netflix and Disney+ for viewer experience quality. My architecture decisions directly determine WBD's competitive positioning. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Resource-Efficient Architecture:** "WBD needs architects who can design competitive streaming platforms with greater resource efficiency than larger competitors. My experience optimizing architecture ROI at [company] directly translates. RSUs of $[Y]K reflect this efficiency value."

3. **Competing Architecture Offers:** "I have competing offers from [AWS/Google Cloud/Netflix] at $[X]K. WBD's architecture ownership is more compelling, but the compensation needs to be competitive."

4. **Multi-Property Integration:** "WBD's architecture must unify systems from the Warner-Discovery merger — integrating HBO Max, Discovery+, and legacy content platforms. My experience with large-scale system integration is directly valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Designing Max's streaming architecture is a world-class architecture challenge. To align with market rates: a base of $[178-192]K, RSU grant of $[108-128]K, and a signing bonus of $[20-30]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At $[238-268]K, this reflects streaming architecture expertise and the integration complexity of WBD's platform. I'm ready to commit."
