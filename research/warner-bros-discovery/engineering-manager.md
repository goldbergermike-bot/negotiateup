**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at WBD lead teams building the technology that powers Max streaming, HBO digital, and Discovery's content platforms. At a $25B company, EMs have significant ownership and visibility — managing teams that directly determine Max's streaming quality, feature velocity, and competitive positioning against Netflix and Disney+. WBD EMs are expected to hire and retain strong engineers in a competitive market, set technical direction, and deliver against ambitious product roadmaps with financial discipline.

WBD has invested in engineering management quality, recognizing that strong EMs who can recruit from Big Tech and streaming competitors are critical to building the Max platform. EM compensation reflects this investment, positioning competitively within the media-tech tier.

**Level Mapping:** WBD EM (M1-M2) = Google L5-L6 Manager = Meta E5-E6 Manager = Amazon L6-L7 Manager = Netflix EM

**WBD Management Leverage Premium**

WBD EMs have an outsized impact because the engineering organization is more compact. An EM at WBD might own an entire product area (e.g., Max playback, content recommendation, ad-tech) rather than a narrow feature team. This breadth of ownership, combined with direct access to VP/SVP leadership, makes WBD an attractive management opportunity for leaders who want high-impact, high-visibility roles.

**Global Levers**

1. **Product Area Ownership:** "At WBD, I'll own an entire product area — not a narrow feature team. This breadth of management scope is equivalent to Director-level roles at larger companies. I'd like a base of $[X]K reflecting this ownership."

2. **Talent Attraction Investment:** "My ability to recruit engineers from Big Tech directly impacts Max's engineering capabilities. Competitive EM compensation enables me to credibly recruit top talent, making this an investment in team quality."

3. **Streaming Market EM Competition:** "I have a competing offer from [Netflix/Disney/Amazon] at $[X]K. WBD's high-ownership EM opportunity is compelling, but the package needs to approach competitive levels."

4. **Leadership in Transformation:** "WBD's technology transformation requires managers who have led similar evolutions. My experience scaling engineering teams at [company] positions me to drive this transformation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about leading engineering at WBD — the ownership and visibility of managing Max's [product area] team is exactly the high-impact leadership I want. To align with the market: a base of $[200-215]K, RSU grant of $[140-165]K, a 15% bonus, and a $[30-45]K signing bonus. My competing offer is $[X]K. At $[285-320]K, this reflects the EM market and WBD's unique high-ownership management roles. I'm ready to lead."
