### Software Engineer | Warner Bros Discovery Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $25B Media Company | Max Streaming + HBO + Discovery | Mid-Tier Media Tech Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / Los Angeles | $125K–$175K | $30K–$110K | 10% | $150K–$235K |
| Atlanta / Seattle | $118K–$165K | $25K–$100K | 10% | $140K–$220K |
| London (UK) | £92K–£130K | £20K–£78K | 10% | $115K–$175K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Warner Bros Discovery build technology for a media company that owns two of the most iconic content brands in entertainment — HBO and Warner Bros. — alongside Discovery's extensive unscripted programming library. WBD's $25B market cap and NYC headquarters position it as a mid-tier media-tech company that offers engineers the opportunity to work on the Max streaming platform, HBO digital properties, Warner Bros. film and TV technology, and Discovery's content operations. While WBD's total comp is below the Big Tech ceiling, it offers competitive packages in the media-tech tier, meaningful ownership of streaming technology, and the opportunity to shape the digital future of premium entertainment content.

WBD's compensation philosophy balances competitive engineering pay with the financial discipline required of a company managing significant debt from the Warner-Discovery merger. Base salaries of $125K-$175K are competitive with media-tech peers, RSU grants up to $110K over four years provide equity upside, and a 10% bonus adds consistent annual upside.

**Level Mapping:** WBD SWE (L3-L4) = Google L3-L4 = Meta E3-E4 = Amazon SDE I-II = Comcast T3-T4 = Disney IC2-IC3

**WBD Technology Premium**

WBD's technology investment is focused primarily on Max streaming and digital content distribution. The company has built engineering teams in NYC, Atlanta, and Seattle, and has attracted talent from Netflix, Amazon, and Google to build Max's streaming infrastructure. SWEs at WBD have more ownership and visibility than they would at larger competitors — at a $25B company, individual engineers can have an outsized impact on product direction and technology strategy.

**Global Levers**

1. **HBO Premium Content Platform:** "I'll build technology for a platform that delivers HBO — the most acclaimed content brand in television. Max's engineering quality determines whether WBD can monetize billions in premium content. This strategic importance warrants a base at the top of band at $[X]K."

2. **Outsized Individual Impact:** "At WBD's size, individual engineers have significantly more ownership and impact than at larger companies. I'll directly influence product direction and technical decisions that affect 100M+ subscribers. This ownership and visibility warrants competitive compensation even if WBD's overall budget differs from Big Tech."

3. **Streaming Competitor Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Netflix/Disney+/Comcast] at $[X]K total comp. While I'm drawn to WBD's premium content story and the individual impact opportunity, the package needs to be competitive. Can we discuss closing the gap with RSUs and a signing bonus?"

4. **Media-Tech Market Positioning:** "WBD competes for the same streaming engineering talent as Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon. While total comp structures differ, the base salary and RSU need to be competitive with the media-tech tier to attract and retain engineers. I'd like total comp of $[X]K."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about WBD — building technology for HBO's content and the Max streaming platform is genuinely compelling. To align with the media-tech market: a base increase to $[X+8-12]K, RSU grant of $[Y+20-35]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[15-25]K to offset unvested equity. My competing offer from [competitor] is $[TC]K. At $[200-235]K total comp, this reflects competitive media-tech rates and the premium content opportunity. I'm ready to sign."
