**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at WBD shape the streaming experience for Max — the platform that delivers HBO's prestige content to 100M+ subscribers worldwide. HBO has always set the standard for premium content, and the Max streaming experience must match that standard of quality. Your design decisions — content discovery, navigation, playback, and personalization — directly impact how audiences engage with HBO, Warner Bros., and Discovery content. WBD has invested in design quality for Max, recognizing that in the competitive streaming landscape, user experience is a key differentiator.

WBD's design team is growing as the company invests in Max's consumer experience. Designers at WBD have more individual ownership and influence than at larger competitors, with direct access to product leadership and meaningful impact on the platform's direction.

**Level Mapping:** WBD Product Designer (D2-D4) = Google L3-L5 UX = Meta E3-E5 Designer = Netflix Product Designer = Disney D2-D4

**WBD Design Ownership Premium**

WBD designers have unusually high individual ownership — a single designer might own an entire product area (discovery, playback, profiles, kids) rather than working on narrow feature increments. This ownership creates meaningful portfolio impact and rapid skill development, making WBD an attractive design environment despite the company's smaller scale.

At $[185-215]K, this reflects premium content design responsibility and the competitive streaming design market. I'm ready to join."
