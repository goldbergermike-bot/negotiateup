#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Nutanix

Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX, ~$17B market cap) is headquartered in San Jose, CA and is the pioneer and leader in hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI). The company's software-defined platform eliminates the complexity of traditional three-tier data center architecture (separate compute, storage, and networking), enabling enterprises to manage their infrastructure like a cloud. Nutanix Cloud Platform (NCP) extends this to hybrid multi-cloud with capabilities spanning AHV virtualization, Nutanix Files, Nutanix Objects, and Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2).

Software Engineers at Nutanix work on deeply technical infrastructure software — distributed storage systems, hypervisor technology, cloud management, and multi-cluster orchestration. The engineering challenges are comparable to those at cloud hyperscalers, but with the added complexity of running on diverse customer hardware.

Nutanix competes for San Jose talent against VMware/Broadcom, Pure Storage, and the full Bay Area tech ecosystem. NTNX stock has shown strong growth as the company transitions to a subscription model, making RSU grants increasingly valuable.

#### Nutanix Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3 | Software Engineer | 1–3 years |
| L4 | Software Engineer II | 3–5 years |
| L5 | Senior Software Engineer | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff Software Engineer | 8–12 years |
| L7 | Principal Software Engineer | 12+ years |

#### Lever 1: HCI Market Leadership

"Nutanix pioneered HCI and continues to lead the market. I build the distributed systems that make hyperconverged infrastructure work at enterprise scale — a technically demanding domain with few companies operating at this level."

#### Lever 2: Cloud Platform Transition

"Nutanix Cloud Platform is the company's strategic evolution from HCI to full hybrid multi-cloud. My cloud-native and distributed systems expertise accelerates this strategic transition."

#### Lever 3: NTNX Stock Growth

"NTNX has shown strong growth during the subscription transition. I want an RSU grant that reflects my engineering impact, with the growth trajectory providing equity upside."

#### Lever 4: Distributed Storage Systems Expertise

"Nutanix's distributed storage system is the technical foundation of HCI. My distributed systems expertise — consensus protocols, data replication, fault tolerance — directly strengthens this core technology."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $178,000 base with NTNX RSUs valued at $60K-$90K/year. Accept-at floor: $243,000 total comp. Cite distributed systems expertise and NTNX growth trajectory.
