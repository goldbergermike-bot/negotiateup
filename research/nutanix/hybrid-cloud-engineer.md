#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Nutanix

This is the signature engineering role at Nutanix. Hybrid Cloud Engineers build the platform that extends Nutanix's hyperconverged infrastructure to public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP) through Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2), enabling enterprises to manage workloads across any environment from a single control plane. This is the core technology that differentiates Nutanix from both traditional infrastructure vendors and cloud-only providers.

Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX, ~$17B market cap) is headquartered in San Jose, CA. The company pioneered HCI and is evolving into a comprehensive hybrid multi-cloud platform. Hybrid Cloud Engineers work on AHV (Nutanix's hypervisor), distributed storage, cloud management, multi-cluster orchestration, and the NC2 cross-cloud infrastructure that runs Nutanix software on public cloud hardware.

The role requires expertise in distributed systems, virtualization, cloud provider APIs, and infrastructure orchestration — a rare combination that bridges on-premises and cloud engineering.

#### Nutanix Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3 | Hybrid Cloud Engineer | 1–3 years |
| L4 | Hybrid Cloud Engineer II | 3–5 years |
| L5 | Senior Hybrid Cloud Engineer | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff Hybrid Cloud Engineer | 8–12 years |
| L7 | Principal Hybrid Cloud Engineer | 12+ years |

#### Lever 1: Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2)

"NC2 extends Nutanix to AWS, Azure, and GCP — the company's strategic multi-cloud offering. I bring experience building cross-cloud infrastructure abstractions and cloud provider integrations that directly accelerate NC2's capabilities."

#### Lever 2: AHV Hypervisor & Distributed Storage

"Nutanix's AHV hypervisor and distributed storage system are the technical foundation of the platform. My expertise in virtualization technology and distributed storage directly strengthens Nutanix's core infrastructure."

#### Lever 3: Multi-Cloud Orchestration

"Managing workloads across on-premises and multiple public clouds requires sophisticated orchestration. I bring experience with multi-cloud management, workload mobility, and infrastructure abstraction layers."

#### Lever 4: Subscription Model Engineering

"Nutanix's transition to subscription revenue requires cloud-like consumption models. I build the metering, licensing, and deployment infrastructure that supports this revenue transformation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $183,000 base with NTNX RSUs valued at $65K-$95K/year. Accept-at floor: $253,000 total comp. Cite hybrid cloud expertise and NC2 strategic importance.
