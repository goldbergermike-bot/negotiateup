#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Nutanix

This is the signature engineering role at Nutanix. Hybrid Cloud Engineers build the platform that extends Nutanix's hyperconverged infrastructure to public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP) through Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2), enabling enterprises to manage workloads across any environment from a single control plane. This is the core technology that differentiates Nutanix from both traditional infrastructure vendors and cloud-only providers.

Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX, ~$17B market cap) is headquartered in San Jose, CA. The company pioneered HCI and is evolving into a comprehensive hybrid multi-cloud platform. Hybrid Cloud Engineers work on AHV (Nutanix's hypervisor), distributed storage, cloud management, multi-cluster orchestration, and the NC2 cross-cloud infrastructure that runs Nutanix software on public cloud hardware.

The role requires expertise in distributed systems, virtualization, cloud provider APIs, and infrastructure orchestration — a rare combination that bridges on-premises and cloud engineering.
