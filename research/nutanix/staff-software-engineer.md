### Staff Software Engineer — Nutanix Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Staff Software Engineers at Nutanix define the technical architecture of the hybrid multi-cloud platform, setting cross-team direction for distributed storage, virtualization, and cloud management spanning on-premises and public cloud environments.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Jose (USD) | Remote US (USD) | Bangalore (INR) |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Staff (L6) | $295,000–$380,000 | $275,000–$355,000 | ₹65,00,000–₹1,00,00,000 |
| Principal (L7) | $365,000–$460,000 | $343,000–$433,000 | ₹95,00,000–₹1,40,00,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary ($195K-$230K for Staff), NTNX RSUs (significantly larger grants), and performance bonus (10-15%).*

#### Lever 1: Platform Architecture Vision — "I define architecture for Nutanix's hybrid multi-cloud platform — spanning distributed storage, AHV virtualization, and cloud management. This scope rivals Staff roles at cloud hyperscalers."

#### Lever 2: Multi-Cloud Strategy — "Nutanix Cloud Clusters (NC2) extend Nutanix to AWS, Azure, and GCP. I architect the cross-cloud platform that differentiates Nutanix from single-cloud vendors."

#### Lever 3: Staff-Level Competition — "I'm evaluating Staff offers at [VMware/Broadcom, Pure Storage, Big Tech]. Nutanix's offer must reflect platform-wide scope."

#### Lever 4: NTNX Equity at Staff Level — "Staff-level NTNX RSU grants should be substantial. I expect equity that reflects platform-defining architectural contributions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $218,000 base with NTNX RSUs valued at $95K-$130K/year. Accept-at floor: $325,000 total comp.
