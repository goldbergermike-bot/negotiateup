### Senior Software Engineer | Cerner (Oracle Health) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Oracle-Acquired / Enterprise Health IT / RSU + Bonus / Senior IC Track

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Kansas City MO | $140K–$190K | $60K–$165K/4yr | 10–12% | $180K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Oracle Health lead the platform modernization from Cerner Millennium to Oracle Health Clinical Cloud — the most complex healthcare platform migration in the industry. Senior engineers own technical design, lead migration workstreams, mentor junior engineers, and make architectural decisions that determine whether Oracle Health can credibly challenge Epic's market dominance. The role requires deep understanding of both legacy Cerner architecture (Millennium, Lights On, CareAware) and modern cloud-native patterns (microservices, Kubernetes, OCI). Post-acquisition comp at the senior level is strong — Oracle enterprise bands with significant ORCL RSU grants provide real equity upside. Oracle is investing heavily in senior engineering talent for Oracle Health because the platform migration's success depends on experienced engineers who can navigate the complexity of modernizing decades of clinical software.

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC3-IC4 Senior = Google L4 = Epic Senior (higher TC) = Optum T4-T5

**Global Levers**

1. **Oracle Enterprise Band Push:** "Senior engineers should be at the top of Oracle enterprise bands. If the offer doesn't include meaningful ORCL RSU grants ($120K+ /4yr), it's likely still on legacy Cerner bands. Push for Oracle IC4 compensation."
2. **Migration Leadership Premium:** "The Millennium-to-Cloud migration is Oracle Health's defining technical challenge. Senior engineers who can lead this modernization are worth a premium — I bring [cloud architecture / migration / healthcare platform] experience that directly accelerates the migration timeline."
3. **Epic Competition Urgency:** "Every month Oracle Health isn't competitive with Epic's cloud offering, hospitals choose Epic instead. Senior engineers who accelerate the platform modernization have direct competitive impact — the urgency premium should be in the comp."
4. **RSU Growth Opportunity:** "ORCL stock benefits from Oracle Health's success. As the platform matures and wins healthcare contracts, the stock appreciation on my RSU grant creates alignment between my engineering impact and comp upside."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $185K with RSUs at $150K/4yr and a 12% bonus target. I'm joining to accelerate the most important platform migration in healthcare IT. My experience with [cloud migration / healthcare platforms / EHR architecture] makes me a high-impact senior engineer from day one." Oracle will counter at $155K-$175K base with $80K-$125K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $240K. Push on RSU grant — Oracle has strong equity flexibility at the senior level.
