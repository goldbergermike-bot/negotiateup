### Product Designer | Cerner (Oracle Health) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Oracle-Acquired / Enterprise Health IT / RSU + Bonus / Clinical UX Redesign

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Kansas City MO | $110K–$160K | $35K–$100K/4yr | 10% | $135K–$215K |
| Austin TX | $115K–$165K | $40K–$105K/4yr | 10% | $145K–$225K |
| Remote US | $105K–$155K | $30K–$95K/4yr | 10% | $125K–$205K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Oracle Health are redesigning the clinical user experience as Cerner's legacy Millennium interfaces transition to the new Oracle Health Clinical Cloud. This is a once-in-a-generation healthcare UX opportunity: redesigning clinical workflows for thousands of hospitals, informed by decades of clinical data and user research. Oracle's investment in design for Oracle Health has increased significantly post-acquisition — the company recognizes that clinical UX quality is a key competitive differentiator against Epic's MyChart and EpicCare interfaces. Designers work on clinician-facing EHR interfaces, patient portals, clinical analytics dashboards, and mobile health applications. Post-acquisition comp includes Oracle RSUs, upgrading from legacy Cerner design compensation. [Source: Oracle Health Design Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC2-IC3 Design = Google L3 UX = Epic Designer (comparable or higher TC with RSUs)

**Global Levers**

1. **Greenfield Clinical UX:** "The Millennium-to-Clinical Cloud transition is a chance to redesign clinical UX from scratch. This greenfield opportunity is rare in healthcare — my clinical design expertise shapes the next generation of EHR interfaces used by millions of clinicians."
2. **Oracle Design Band Verification:** "Confirm this is on Oracle enterprise design bands with ORCL RSUs, not legacy Cerner design analyst comp."
3. **Competitive Differentiation:** "Clinical UX quality directly determines whether hospitals choose Oracle Health over Epic. My design work is a competitive weapon — it deserves comp that reflects that strategic importance."
4. **Clinical UX Expertise:** "I bring healthcare UX experience — clinical workflow design, patient safety, accessibility — that general designers take years to develop."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $155K with RSUs at $90K/4yr and a 10% bonus. My clinical UX experience directly accelerates Oracle Health's most critical design initiative — the Clinical Cloud interface redesign." Oracle will counter at $125K-$145K base with $45K-$75K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $175K. Push on base salary.
