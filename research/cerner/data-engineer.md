### Data Engineer | Cerner (Oracle Health) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Oracle-Acquired / Enterprise Health IT / RSU + Bonus / Healthcare Data Migration

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Kansas City MO | $125K–$175K | $45K–$135K/4yr | 10% | $155K–$250K |
| Austin TX | $130K–$180K | $50K–$140K/4yr | 10% | $160K–$255K |
| Remote US | $120K–$170K | $40K–$130K/4yr | 10% | $145K–$240K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Oracle Health build the data infrastructure that powers both the legacy Cerner Millennium data warehouse and the new Oracle Health Clinical Cloud data platform. The role is uniquely complex during the post-acquisition transition: engineers must maintain existing Cerner data pipelines while building new data architectures on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) — including Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Data Integrator, and OCI Data Lake services. Cerner's healthcare data asset spans decades of clinical records across thousands of hospitals, and migrating this data to Oracle's cloud while maintaining data integrity, HIPAA compliance, and clinical continuity is one of the most challenging data engineering projects in healthcare IT. Oracle has brought its enterprise data tooling (Exadata, Autonomous DB) to bear on healthcare data, creating opportunities for data engineers to work with cutting-edge database technology applied to clinical data.

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC2-IC3 DE = Google L3-L4 DE = UHG DE = Epic DE (higher TC with RSUs)

**Global Levers**

1. **Oracle Data Technology Access:** "I'll work with Oracle's most advanced data technology (Autonomous Database, Exadata, OCI Data Services) applied to healthcare data. This combination of enterprise data infrastructure and clinical data expertise is rare and marketable."
2. **Oracle Band Confirmation:** "I need this offer on Oracle enterprise data engineering bands with ORCL RSUs — not legacy Cerner data analyst bands. The post-acquisition comp upgrade should be fully reflected."
3. **Healthcare Data Migration Complexity:** "Migrating decades of Cerner clinical data to OCI while maintaining HIPAA compliance and data integrity is an extraordinarily complex data engineering challenge. My experience with [healthcare data migration / clinical data models / cloud data platforms] directly addresses this challenge."
4. **Clinical Data Standards Expertise:** "I bring HL7 FHIR, X12 EDI, and clinical coding expertise that general Oracle data engineers lack. Healthcare data engineering requires domain specialization that takes years to develop."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $170K with RSUs at $120K/4yr and a 10% bonus. Confirm this is on Oracle enterprise bands. My healthcare data engineering experience with [clinical data / FHIR / data migration] accelerates Oracle Health's data platform build." Oracle will counter at $140K-$160K base with $60K-$95K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $195K. Push on RSU grant — it's where Oracle has the most flexibility.
