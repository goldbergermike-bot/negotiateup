**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Oracle Health build predictive models and clinical analytics on one of the largest clinical datasets in EHR history — decades of Cerner Millennium data across thousands of hospitals, now being enhanced with Oracle's AI/ML capabilities (Oracle AI, OCI Data Science). The post-acquisition combination creates a powerful analytics platform: Cerner's clinical data depth + Oracle's enterprise AI tooling + OCI's compute scale. Data scientists work on clinical prediction models (sepsis, readmission, deterioration), operational analytics (OR utilization, length-of-stay prediction), population health modeling, and research analytics. Oracle is investing in embedding AI predictions directly into the Oracle Health Clinical Cloud workflow — making data science work clinician-facing, not just dashboard-facing.

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC2-IC3 DS = Google L3-L4 DS = Optum DS = UHG DS (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Oracle AI Platform Access:** "Oracle Health data scientists work with Oracle's enterprise AI platform — OCI Data Science, Oracle Machine Learning, and Oracle AI — applied to clinical data. This combination of enterprise AI tooling and healthcare data is unique and marketable."
2. **Oracle Comp Band Verification:** "Confirm this offer is on Oracle enterprise data science bands with ORCL RSUs. Legacy Cerner data analyst comp was significantly below market."
3. **Clinical Data Science Expertise:** "I bring healthcare data science experience — clinical prediction models, survival analysis, healthcare outcome measures — that general Oracle data scientists don't have. This domain expertise has immediate value during the clinical cloud migration."
4. **Workflow-Embedded AI Frame:** "Oracle is embedding AI predictions directly into clinical workflows. Data scientists who understand both ML and clinical workflow integration are rare — my experience bridges this gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $175K with RSUs at $125K/4yr and a 12% bonus. My clinical data science experience with [prediction models / clinical analytics / healthcare ML] maps directly to Oracle Health's AI strategy." Oracle will counter at $145K-$165K base with $65K-$100K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $210K. Push on RSU and bonus.
