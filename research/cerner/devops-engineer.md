| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Kansas City MO | $125K–$175K | $45K–$135K/4yr | 10% | $155K–$250K |
| Austin TX | $130K–$180K | $50K–$140K/4yr | 10% | $160K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Oracle Health manage the critical infrastructure migration from Cerner's legacy hosting to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This is one of the largest healthcare cloud migrations in history — moving thousands of hospital system instances from on-premises and legacy cloud to OCI while maintaining 99.99%+ uptime for clinical systems. DevOps engineers build CI/CD pipelines, manage Kubernetes clusters on OCI, implement infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, OCI Resource Manager), and ensure HIPAA-compliant infrastructure across all deployment environments. The post-acquisition context makes this role uniquely complex: engineers must support both legacy Cerner infrastructure AND new OCI-based deployments during the multi-year transition. Oracle brings enterprise-grade DevOps tooling that improves upon legacy Cerner infrastructure, but the migration itself requires careful planning and execution.

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC2-IC3 DevOps = Google L3-L4 SRE = UHG DevOps (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Cloud Migration Critical Path:** "The Cerner-to-OCI migration is Oracle Health's most critical infrastructure program. DevOps engineers who can execute this migration — managing dual environments, ensuring zero-downtime cutover, maintaining HIPAA compliance — are on the critical path for Oracle Health's success."
2. **OCI Expertise Premium:** "I bring Oracle Cloud Infrastructure experience (or equivalent cloud expertise) that accelerates the migration. OCI-proficient DevOps engineers are scarce because OCI's market share is growing but talent supply lags AWS/Azure."
3. **Oracle Band Confirmation:** "Confirm this is on Oracle enterprise DevOps bands with ORCL RSUs, not legacy Cerner infrastructure bands."
4. **HIPAA Infrastructure Complexity:** "Healthcare cloud infrastructure requires HIPAA-compliant deployment pipelines, PHI data residency controls, and automated compliance scanning. I bring this regulated-infrastructure expertise from day one."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $170K with RSUs at $120K/4yr and a 10% bonus. I'm joining during the most critical infrastructure migration in Oracle Health's history. My [OCI / cloud / healthcare infrastructure] experience accelerates this migration." Oracle will counter at $140K-$160K base with $60K-$95K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $195K. Push on RSU grant.
