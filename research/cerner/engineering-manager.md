### Engineering Manager | Cerner (Oracle Health) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Oracle-Acquired / Enterprise Health IT / RSU + Bonus / Post-Acquisition Team Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Kansas City MO | $155K–$210K | $80K–$200K/4yr | 12–20% | $220K–$330K |
| Austin TX | $160K–$215K | $85K–$210K/4yr | 12–20% | $230K–$345K |
| Remote US | $150K–$200K | $75K–$190K/4yr | 12–20% | $210K–$320K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Oracle Health lead teams navigating the most complex transition in healthcare IT — the Cerner-to-Oracle Health platform migration. EMs must manage teams through organizational change (Oracle culture integration), technical transformation (Millennium to Clinical Cloud), and talent retention (competing with Epic, Optum, and health tech for experienced engineers). Post-acquisition, EM compensation has been upgraded to Oracle enterprise management bands — a significant improvement over legacy Cerner EM comp. The role requires leading through ambiguity: managing dual-platform engineering (maintaining Millennium while building Clinical Cloud), integrating Oracle engineering practices, and retaining team members who may be skeptical of the acquisition. EMs who can navigate this transition while maintaining team productivity and morale are exceptionally valuable to Oracle Health. [Source: Oracle Health Engineering Leadership 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC4-IC5 EM = Google L5-L6 EM = Optum T5-T6 EM = UHG EM (higher TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Transition Leadership Premium:** "Leading engineering teams through the Cerner-to-Oracle transition is uniquely complex — culture change, platform migration, and talent retention simultaneously. My change-management leadership experience commands a premium over standard EM roles."
2. **Oracle EM Band Confirmation:** "Oracle enterprise EM bands include substantial ORCL RSU grants and 15-20% bonus targets. Confirm this offer is on Oracle management bands, not legacy Cerner manager comp."
3. **Retention Cost Economics:** "Post-acquisition attrition is the biggest risk. Every engineer I retain saves Oracle $150K-$250K in recruiting/ramp costs. My leadership directly protects Oracle Health's most valuable asset — its experienced engineering talent."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "Oracle Health EMs should be at the top of Oracle management bonus bands (18-20%) given the strategic importance and complexity of this initiative."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with RSUs at $180K/4yr and a 20% bonus target. I'm joining to lead through Oracle Health's most critical transition. My experience managing engineering teams through [platform migration / acquisition integration / organizational change] at [current company] makes me uniquely qualified." Oracle will counter at $175K-$195K base with $100K-$155K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $280K. Push on RSU and bonus target.
