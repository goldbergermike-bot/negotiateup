**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Oracle Health protect EHR data during the highest-risk phase of the Cerner-to-Oracle migration — when data is moving between legacy and new systems, attack surfaces are expanded, and compliance requirements span both environments. Oracle brings enterprise-grade security capabilities (Oracle Cloud Guard, Oracle Security Zones, Oracle Identity Cloud) that improve upon Cerner's legacy security posture, but the migration itself creates temporary vulnerabilities that must be managed. The healthcare cybersecurity landscape has become more threatening post-Change Healthcare breach, and hospitals are demanding stronger security from their EHR vendors. Security engineers must manage HIPAA/HITRUST compliance, cloud security (OCI), application security, and the unique challenges of securing clinical systems during a major platform transition.

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC3-IC4 Security = Google L4 Security = Optum Security (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Migration Security Criticality:** "Securing the Cerner-to-OCI migration is Oracle Health's highest security priority. Data in transit between systems, expanded attack surfaces during transition, and dual-environment compliance create a uniquely complex security challenge."
2. **Oracle Security Platform:** "I'll leverage Oracle's enterprise security tooling (Cloud Guard, Security Zones, IAM) — some of the strongest cloud security capabilities in the industry — applied to healthcare. This Oracle security platform expertise is valuable."
3. **Post-Change Healthcare Urgency:** "Hospital clients are demanding stronger security from EHR vendors. Oracle Health's security posture is a competitive differentiator against Epic. My security work directly supports Oracle Health's sales positioning."
4. **Oracle Security Band + HIPAA Premium:** "Oracle enterprise security bands should stack with a healthcare security premium. Confirm ORCL RSUs and top-of-band compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $185K with RSUs at $140K/4yr and a 15% bonus. I'm joining to secure Oracle Health's most critical infrastructure migration. My healthcare security experience with [HIPAA / cloud security / migration security] directly addresses Oracle Health's highest-priority needs." Oracle will counter at $155K-$175K base with $75K-$115K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $230K. Push on RSU.
