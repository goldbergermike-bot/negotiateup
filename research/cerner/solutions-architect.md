### Solutions Architect | Cerner (Oracle Health) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Oracle-Acquired / Enterprise Health IT / RSU + Bonus / Migration Architecture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Kansas City MO | $140K–$195K | $60K–$160K/4yr | 10–15% | $185K–$285K |
| Austin TX | $145K–$200K | $65K–$165K/4yr | 10–15% | $190K–$295K |
| Remote US | $135K–$190K | $55K–$155K/4yr | 10–15% | $175K–$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Oracle Health design the technical architecture for hospital system migrations from Cerner Millennium to Oracle Health Clinical Cloud — multi-year, multi-million dollar engagements that determine Oracle Health's competitive success against Epic. The role is client-facing: architects work directly with hospital CIOs and IT directors to design migration plans, integration architectures, and data flow patterns. They must understand both Cerner's legacy architecture and Oracle's cloud capabilities (OCI, Oracle Database, integration services) to design viable migration paths that maintain clinical continuity. Solutions Architects at Oracle Health also design new deployments for hospitals choosing Oracle Health over Epic — requiring deep knowledge of healthcare interoperability (HL7 FHIR, X12 EDI), clinical workflows, and regulatory requirements. Post-acquisition comp is on Oracle enterprise SA bands with ORCL RSUs. [Source: Oracle Health Solutions Architecture 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC4-IC5 SA = Google L5 Solutions = AWS Senior SA = Optum SA (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Client Migration Architecture:** "Each hospital migration I architect is a multi-million dollar, multi-year engagement. My architectural decisions directly impact migration success, client satisfaction, and contract revenue."
2. **Dual-Platform Architecture Expertise:** "I must understand both Cerner Millennium and Oracle Cloud to design viable migration paths. This dual expertise is rare and takes significant time to develop."
3. **Oracle SA Band Confirmation:** "Oracle enterprise SA bands are strong. Confirm this offer includes full Oracle comp with ORCL RSUs — not legacy Cerner SA comp."
4. **Healthcare Interoperability Standards:** "I bring HL7 FHIR, X12 EDI, and healthcare integration expertise essential for designing hospital system architectures."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $190K with RSUs at $145K/4yr and a 15% bonus. My healthcare solutions architecture experience — designing [EHR migrations / hospital integrations / FHIR architectures] — directly accelerates Oracle Health's client migration pipeline." Oracle will counter at $160K-$180K base with $80K-$120K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $245K. Push on RSU grant.
