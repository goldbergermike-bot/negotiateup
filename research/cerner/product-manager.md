**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Oracle Health own the product strategy for the transition from Cerner Millennium to Oracle Health Clinical Cloud — arguably the highest-stakes product migration in healthcare IT. PMs must balance competing priorities: maintaining Millennium functionality for existing hospital clients while building the next-generation Clinical Cloud product that will compete against Epic. The role requires deep healthcare domain expertise (clinical workflows, hospital operations, regulatory requirements), enterprise product management skills, and the ability to manage stakeholders across Oracle's enterprise organization and healthcare-system clients. Post-acquisition, PM compensation has been upgraded to Oracle enterprise bands with ORCL RSUs — a significant improvement over legacy Cerner PM comp.

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC3-IC4 PM = Google L4-L5 PM = Epic PM (higher TC with RSUs) = Optum PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Transition Product Strategy:** "I'm owning product strategy during the most critical transition in Oracle Health's history. Every product decision — feature prioritization, migration timeline, client communication — affects whether Oracle Health can compete with Epic. This strategic importance justifies premium comp."
2. **Oracle PM Band Confirmation:** "Confirm this is on Oracle enterprise PM bands with ORCL RSUs, not legacy Cerner PM comp. The post-acquisition upgrade should be fully reflected."
3. **Healthcare Product Domain:** "Healthcare product management requires understanding clinical workflows, regulatory constraints, and hospital operations. My domain expertise shortens the PM productivity ramp by 12+ months."
4. **Client Revenue Stewardship:** "Each hospital client represents millions in annual revenue. My product decisions directly impact client retention during the migration. Poor product decisions lead to client churn to Epic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $180K with RSUs at $135K/4yr and a 15% bonus. I'm joining during Oracle Health's most critical product transition. My healthcare PM experience with [EHR / clinical workflow / hospital operations] means I can drive product strategy from day one." Oracle will counter at $150K-$170K base with $70K-$110K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $225K. Push on RSU and bonus.
