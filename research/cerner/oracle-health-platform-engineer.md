### Oracle Health Platform Engineer | Cerner (Oracle Health) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Oracle-Acquired / Enterprise Health IT / RSU + Bonus / Post-Acquisition Comp Upgrade | **SIGNATURE ROLE**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Kansas City MO | $140K–$185K | $60K–$160K/4yr | 10–15% | $180K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Cerner was acquired by Oracle for $28.3B in 2022 and rebranded as Oracle Health. The Oracle Health Platform Engineer is the signature role — building Oracle's next-generation cloud-based health platform (Oracle Health Clinical Cloud) that represents Oracle's strategy to displace Epic as the dominant EHR. Larry Ellison has personally championed the healthcare vision, calling it Oracle's "most important project." The platform engineer builds on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), integrating Cerner's clinical data assets with Oracle's database, cloud, and AI capabilities. Post-acquisition, compensation has been upgraded to Oracle bands — a significant improvement over legacy Cerner comp. Engineers now receive Oracle RSUs (ORCL stock), which provides real equity upside. The Kansas City office remains the primary hub, but Oracle's distributed model offers more location flexibility than legacy Cerner. The role requires deep understanding of EHR architecture, clinical data models, cloud infrastructure, and healthcare interoperability standards.

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC3-IC4 = Google L4 = Epic Senior = UHG Senior Engineer

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Oracle Health Platform Engineer builds the platform Oracle believes will transform healthcare:
- **Epic Challenger:** Oracle is investing billions to build a cloud-native EHR that competes directly with Epic's 38% market share
- **OCI + Clinical Data:** Combining Oracle's database/cloud infrastructure with Cerner's 30+ years of clinical data
- **Larry Ellison's Priority:** Oracle's CEO has called this the company's most important strategic initiative — highest executive visibility
- **Greenfield Cloud Architecture:** Building Oracle Health Clinical Cloud from the ground up — not maintaining legacy code

**Global Levers**

1. **Larry Ellison Priority Frame:** "Oracle Health is Larry Ellison's personal strategic priority. Engineers on this platform have unprecedented executive visibility and organizational support. My comp should reflect the strategic importance of this initiative — not generic Oracle enterprise engineering bands."
2. **Post-Acquisition Oracle Comp Upgrade:** "Legacy Cerner comp was significantly below market. Post-acquisition, Oracle has upgraded compensation to Oracle enterprise bands including ORCL RSUs. I need to confirm my offer is on Oracle bands — not legacy Cerner bands that some hiring managers still reference."
3. **Epic Competition Urgency:** "Oracle Health is trying to challenge Epic's 38% EHR market share. The urgency of this competitive battle means every platform engineer hired is strategically critical. The offer should reflect this competitive urgency, not business-as-usual hiring."
4. **Cloud Platform Expertise:** "I bring cloud-native architecture experience (OCI/AWS/Azure) combined with healthcare platform knowledge. This dual expertise is exactly what Oracle needs to build a cloud-native EHR — and it commands a premium over general enterprise engineers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $185K with RSUs at $150K/4yr and a 15% bonus target. I'm joining Oracle's most strategically important initiative, and my comp should reflect that priority. My experience building [cloud healthcare platforms / EHR systems / clinical data infrastructure] maps directly to Oracle Health's platform engineering needs." Oracle will counter at $155K-$175K base with $80K-$120K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $235K. Push on RSU grant — Oracle has significant equity flexibility for priority initiatives. **Floor: Do not accept if offered legacy Cerner bands without Oracle RSUs.**
