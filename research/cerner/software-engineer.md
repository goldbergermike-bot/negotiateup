**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Cerner (now Oracle Health) build the EHR platform that serves as Oracle's primary weapon against Epic in the healthcare market. Post-Oracle acquisition ($28.3B in 2022), the engineering organization has undergone significant transformation — Oracle is modernizing Cerner's legacy architecture onto Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), implementing Oracle engineering practices, and upgrading compensation from legacy Cerner bands to Oracle enterprise bands. Software Engineers now receive Oracle RSUs (ORCL stock), a major upgrade from legacy Cerner's limited equity program. The role spans Millennium platform maintenance, Oracle Health Clinical Cloud development, mobile health applications, and healthcare integration services. Kansas City remains the primary hub, but Oracle's distributed model has expanded remote and multi-site options. Engineers should be aware that two different comp structures may exist during the transition — legacy Cerner bands and Oracle bands — and should always negotiate for Oracle bands.

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC2-IC3 SWE = Google L3 = Epic SWE (higher TC with Oracle RSUs) = UHG SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Oracle Band Confirmation:** "I need to confirm this offer is on Oracle enterprise compensation bands — not legacy Cerner bands. The acquisition was completed in 2022 and all new hires should be on Oracle structures including ORCL RSUs."
2. **Platform Modernization Value:** "I'm joining during a massive platform modernization from Cerner Millennium to Oracle Health Clinical Cloud. Engineers with cloud-native experience are especially valuable during this transition — my skills accelerate the migration."
3. **Healthcare Platform Expertise:** "I bring healthcare software experience — HIPAA compliance, clinical data models, EHR workflows — that general Oracle enterprise engineers don't have. This domain expertise shortens the ramp to productivity by 6-12 months."
4. **Epic Competition Frame:** "Oracle Health is directly competing with Epic's 38% market share. Every engineer hired strengthens Oracle's competitive position. The offer should reflect the strategic importance of this competitive battle."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $165K with RSUs at $115K/4yr and a 10% bonus target. Please confirm this is on Oracle enterprise bands with ORCL RSUs, not legacy Cerner bands. My healthcare platform experience makes me productive from day one on the Oracle Health migration." Oracle will counter at $135K-$155K base with $55K-$90K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $190K. **Critical: If offered legacy Cerner bands without Oracle RSUs, push back immediately.**
