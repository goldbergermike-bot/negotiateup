**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Oracle Health are the technical architects of the Millennium-to-Cloud platform transformation. At this level, engineers set cross-team architectural direction, lead the most complex migration workstreams, make strategic technology decisions (OCI service selection, data architecture patterns, API strategy), and serve as the bridge between Oracle's enterprise engineering culture and Cerner's healthcare domain expertise. Staff engineers at Oracle Health have outsized influence because the platform migration requires architects who understand both worlds — Oracle's cloud infrastructure capabilities and Cerner's clinical data models. Post-acquisition comp at Staff level is the strongest — Oracle enterprise IC5 bands with substantial ORCL RSU grants. Larry Ellison's personal investment in Oracle Health means Staff engineers on this initiative have executive visibility typically reserved for VP-level roles at other companies.

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC5 Staff = Google L5-L6 = Microsoft Principal = Optum T6-T7

**Global Levers**

1. **Oracle IC5 Band Maximum:** "Staff engineers on Oracle Health — Larry Ellison's priority initiative — should be at the top of Oracle IC5 bands. If the RSU grant is below $180K/4yr, it's not reflecting the strategic importance of this role."
2. **Architecture-Level Impact:** "My architectural decisions shape the entire Oracle Health platform — database design, service architecture, API strategy, migration patterns. These decisions affect Oracle Health's competitive viability against Epic for the next decade."
3. **Cross-Domain Bridge Value:** "Staff engineers who understand both Oracle enterprise infrastructure AND healthcare domain architecture are exceptionally rare. I bridge these two worlds — that dual expertise justifies premium compensation."
4. **Executive Visibility:** "Oracle Health Staff engineers have visibility to Larry Ellison's office. This strategic importance should be reflected in compensation — not standard Oracle enterprise bands."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $220K with RSUs at $210K/4yr and an 18% bonus target. I'm joining Oracle's most strategically important initiative at the Staff architect level. My experience with [cloud platform architecture / healthcare systems migration / EHR infrastructure] makes me uniquely qualified to lead Oracle Health's technical direction." Oracle will counter at $185K-$210K base with $130K-$190K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $310K. Push hard on RSU — Oracle has the most flexibility there for priority initiatives.
