### Technical Program Manager | Cerner (Oracle Health) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Oracle-Acquired / Enterprise Health IT / RSU + Bonus / Migration Program Execution

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Kansas City MO | $140K–$195K | $55K–$150K/4yr | 10–15% | $180K–$280K |
| Austin TX | $145K–$200K | $60K–$155K/4yr | 10–15% | $185K–$290K |
| Remote US | $135K–$185K | $50K–$140K/4yr | 10–15% | $170K–$265K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Oracle Health drive the execution of the Cerner-to-Oracle Health platform migration — the most complex program management challenge in healthcare IT. TPMs coordinate across Oracle engineering teams, legacy Cerner teams, hospital client stakeholders, and Oracle enterprise infrastructure teams. Migration programs span 2-5 years per hospital system, involving clinical workflow transitions, data migration, integration reconfiguration, clinician training, and go-live support. TPMs manage dozens of interdependent workstreams with hard regulatory and clinical continuity deadlines — hospital EHR transitions cannot tolerate extended downtime. The role requires deep healthcare program management expertise, technical fluency across both Cerner and Oracle platforms, and exceptional stakeholder management. Post-acquisition comp is on Oracle enterprise TPM bands with ORCL RSUs. [Source: Oracle Health Program Management Office 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC3-IC4 TPM = Google L4-L5 TPM = Optum TPM (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Migration Program Complexity:** "The Cerner-to-Oracle Health migration is the most complex healthcare IT program in the industry. TPMs who can manage this multi-year, multi-stakeholder migration execution command a premium."
2. **Oracle TPM Band Confirmation:** "Confirm this is on Oracle enterprise TPM bands with ORCL RSUs. Legacy Cerner project manager comp was significantly below market."
3. **Client-Facing Program Accountability:** "Each hospital migration I manage has multi-million dollar financial stakes. Program execution quality directly affects client retention and Oracle Health's reputation."
4. **Healthcare Program Expertise:** "I bring experience managing complex healthcare technology programs with regulatory deadlines and clinical continuity requirements."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $190K with RSUs at $135K/4yr and a 15% bonus. I'm managing Oracle Health's highest-stakes programs. My healthcare program management experience with [EHR migration / platform transition / hospital IT] directly maps to Oracle Health's most critical needs." Oracle will counter at $155K-$175K base with $70K-$110K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $230K. Push on RSU and bonus.
