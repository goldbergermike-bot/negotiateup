### ML/AI Engineer | Cerner (Oracle Health) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Oracle-Acquired / Enterprise Health IT / RSU + Bonus | **+10-15% AI/ML PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Kansas City MO | $140K–$190K | $60K–$165K/4yr | 10–15% | $185K–$285K |
| Austin TX | $145K–$195K | $65K–$170K/4yr | 10–15% | $190K–$295K |
| Remote US | $135K–$185K | $55K–$155K/4yr | 10–15% | $175K–$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Oracle Health combine Cerner's decades of clinical data with Oracle's enterprise AI platform (Oracle AI, OCI Data Science, Oracle Machine Learning) to build production healthcare AI systems. The post-acquisition combination is powerful: Cerner's clinical data depth provides training data that few companies can match, while Oracle's AI infrastructure provides the compute and tooling to build enterprise-grade ML systems. ML engineers work on clinical prediction (sepsis, deterioration, readmission), clinical NLP (extracting structured data from clinical notes), clinical decision support, and operational optimization models. Oracle is investing in embedding AI directly into the Oracle Health Clinical Cloud — making ML engineering a core part of the product experience, not a side project. The AI/ML premium at Oracle Health is 10-15% above standard engineering bands. [Source: Oracle Health AI Strategy 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Oracle Health IC3-IC4 ML = Google L4 ML = Optum ML = UHG ML (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **Oracle AI Platform + Clinical Data:** "The combination of Oracle's enterprise AI platform and Cerner's clinical dataset is one of the most powerful healthcare AI development environments in the world. I'm choosing Oracle Health for this unique advantage — the comp should reflect the strategic importance of AI to Oracle Health's differentiation."
2. **AI Premium Stacking:** "The ML/AI premium (10-15%) should be on top of Oracle enterprise bands, not legacy Cerner bands. I need confirmation that both the Oracle comp upgrade and the AI premium are reflected."
3. **Clinical AI Safety Expertise:** "Healthcare ML requires rigorous validation, explainability, and safety standards. My experience with [clinical model validation / healthcare ML safety / FDA regulatory AI] eliminates the training ramp on clinical AI requirements."
4. **Competitive AI Talent Market:** "Tempus, Epic, Google Health, and pharma AI companies are all hiring healthcare ML engineers. Oracle Health's offer needs to be competitive with these alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $185K with RSUs at $150K/4yr and a 15% bonus. The AI premium should stack on Oracle enterprise bands. My clinical ML experience with [prediction models / clinical NLP / healthcare AI safety] directly accelerates Oracle Health's AI roadmap." Oracle will counter at $155K-$175K base with $80K-$125K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $240K. Push on RSU — Oracle has AI-specific equity flexibility.
