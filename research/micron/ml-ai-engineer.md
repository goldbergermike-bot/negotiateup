| Remote US | $155K–$202K | $52K–$85K | 10–18% | $238K–$330K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Micron sit at a remarkable intersection: they build the machine learning models that optimize production of the very memory chips (HBM3E) that power the AI training clusters running those same types of models. Micron deploys ML across yield prediction, automated defect classification, predictive maintenance, process control optimization, and demand forecasting — all applied to a manufacturing environment generating petabytes of data daily. With HBM capacity sold out through 2026, ML/AI Engineers who can squeeze even fractional yield improvements from production lines create outsized revenue impact. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects both the scarcity of ML talent willing to work in semiconductor manufacturing and the transformative impact of ML on fab output (Micron AI/ML research publications; Levels.fyi ML Engineer compensation, 2024–2025).

**Level Mapping:**
- Micron ML/AI Engineer (Band 7–8) maps to Google MLE L5–L6, Meta ML Engineer E5–E6, Amazon Applied Scientist II–Sr.
- Comparable to Intel AI Lab Engineer or NVIDIA CUDA/ML Engineer
- Senior ML Engineer (Band 8–9) requires demonstrated production ML deployment in manufacturing environments

**Sold-Out HBM Capacity — The Capacity Guardian Premium**

Micron's HBM capacity is sold out through 2026, and ML/AI Engineers are the Capacity Guardians who use machine learning to unlock hidden yield from fully committed production lines. When physical capacity cannot be expanded, the only way to increase effective HBM output is through yield improvement — and ML is the most powerful tool for finding the subtle patterns in billions of data points that traditional statistical methods miss. A defect classification model you build that catches yield-limiting defects 6 hours earlier than current methods could save entire production lots worth $50M+. A process control optimization model that improves HBM3E uniformity by 0.5% could produce thousands of additional HBM stacks per quarter. NVIDIA, AMD, and Google TPU are all desperate for more HBM — your ML models literally create supply that doesn't otherwise exist. This justifies a 25% memory premium on top of the 15-25% AI talent premium, making you one of the highest-leverage hires in the semiconductor industry. Frame your negotiation around the ROI of your models: a single successful ML deployment in HBM production can generate $100M+ in incremental annual revenue.

**Global Levers**

1. **ML Yield Improvement ROI:** "A single ML model I deploy for HBM yield prediction can generate $100M+ in incremental annual revenue by catching yield-limiting defects earlier. My compensation is a fraction of the value I create."
2. **Dual AI Premium:** "I command both an AI talent scarcity premium (15-25%) and a memory semiconductor premium — ML engineers willing to apply their skills to manufacturing rather than ad-tech or recommendation systems are exceptionally rare."
3. **Competing ML Offers:** "I have competing offers from [Google Brain/DeepMind/NVIDIA Research/OpenAI] at $380K total comp. I'm choosing manufacturing ML impact over research prestige, but the compensation needs to reflect my market value."
4. **Production ML Deployment Experience:** "I have production ML experience in manufacturing environments — not just research papers. Engineers who can deploy and maintain ML models in real-time fab environments are 10x scarcer than research ML engineers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $172K base and $58K RSUs. I'm deeply excited about applying ML to Micron's HBM yield optimization — this is the highest-impact ML problem in semiconductors today. Given that HBM capacity is sold out through 2026 and my ML models will literally create additional HBM supply from existing production lines, I believe this warrants both the Capacity Guardian premium and the AI talent premium. I'm targeting $195K base and $82K in RSUs over four years, bringing total comp to approximately $315K. I have competing ML offers at $370K total comp from major AI research labs. My accept-at floor is $298K total comp with a $35K signing bonus. I'm choosing Micron because manufacturing ML creates more tangible impact than any ad-tech model — but the comp gap needs to be reasonable."
