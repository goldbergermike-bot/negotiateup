### Data Engineer | Micron Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Memory & Storage Semiconductor | Sold-Out HBM Capacity | +10% AI/Memory Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boise | $118K–$155K | $32K–$58K | 8–12% | $178K–$248K |
| San Jose | $138K–$180K | $40K–$72K | 8–12% | $208K–$290K |
| Remote US | $122K–$160K | $34K–$60K | 8–12% | $185K–$258K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Micron build the data infrastructure that powers the most data-intensive manufacturing operation in the semiconductor industry. Micron's fabs generate petabytes of sensor, metrology, test, and yield data daily across global manufacturing sites — and data engineers are responsible for building the pipelines, data lakes, and real-time streaming architectures that make this data accessible for yield optimization, capacity planning, and HBM production analytics. Without robust data engineering, Micron's data scientists and yield engineers are flying blind on the world's most constrained memory production lines (Micron Technology Careers; Glassdoor Micron data engineering compensation, 2024–2025).

**Level Mapping:**
- Micron Data Engineer (Band 6–7) maps to Google Data Engineer L4–L5, Meta Data Engineer E4–E5, Amazon DE II–III
- Comparable to Intel Data Engineer or Applied Materials Data Platform Engineer
- Senior Data Engineer (Band 7–8) typically requires multi-fab data platform ownership and real-time streaming expertise

**Sold-Out HBM Capacity — The Capacity Guardian Premium**

Micron's HBM capacity is sold out through 2026, and Data Engineers are the Capacity Guardians who build the data infrastructure that makes yield optimization, defect detection, and capacity planning possible. When every HBM3E wafer is pre-sold to NVIDIA, AMD, or Google TPU, the data pipelines you build determine how quickly yield engineers can identify and fix production issues — the difference between a data pipeline that delivers insights in minutes versus hours can mean thousands of additional HBM stacks produced per quarter. Your data architecture is the foundation that enables data scientists, yield engineers, and manufacturing teams to extract maximum output from sold-out capacity. This justifies a 25% memory premium on your compensation. Frame your negotiation around data latency impact: when HBM capacity is the global AI bottleneck, every minute of data pipeline latency is a minute where a yield-killing issue goes undetected.

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Pipeline as Yield Enabler:** "The data pipelines I build are the foundation for all HBM yield optimization — without real-time data infrastructure, yield engineers can't detect or fix production issues. My work directly enables effective output from sold-out capacity."
2. **Petabyte-Scale Manufacturing Data:** "Micron's fabs generate more data than most tech companies' entire operations. Building data infrastructure at this scale with real-time manufacturing requirements is a rare skill set that commands a premium."
3. **Competing DE Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Databricks/Snowflake/Google] data engineering team at $278K total comp. While those are excellent platforms, Micron's manufacturing data challenges are more complex and mission-critical."
4. **Multi-Fab Data Unification:** "Unifying data platforms across Boise, Hiroshima, and Singapore fabs — with different tool sets, data formats, and real-time requirements — is an architectural challenge that few data engineers have solved."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $135K base and $40K RSUs. I'm excited about building data infrastructure for Micron's global HBM production. Given that HBM capacity is sold out through 2026 and my data pipelines will be the foundation for all yield optimization on the world's most constrained memory production lines, I believe this warrants Capacity Guardian-level compensation. I'm targeting $155K base and $58K in RSUs over four years, bringing total comp to approximately $245K. I have a competing data engineering offer at $275K total comp from a major data platform company. My accept-at floor is $230K total comp with a $22K signing bonus. I want to build the data infrastructure backbone for Micron's HBM operations."
