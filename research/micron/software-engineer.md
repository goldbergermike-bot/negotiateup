### Software Engineer | Micron Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Memory & Storage Semiconductor | Sold-Out HBM Capacity | +10% AI/Memory Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boise | $110K–$140K | $30K–$55K | 8–12% | $165K–$225K |
| San Jose | $130K–$165K | $40K–$70K | 8–12% | $195K–$265K |
| Remote US | $115K–$148K | $32K–$58K | 8–12% | $172K–$235K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Micron Technology is one of only three companies in the world that manufactures DRAM and NAND flash memory at scale, making every engineering hire a strategic asset in a supply-constrained market. Software engineers at Micron work on firmware, embedded systems, memory controller logic, and the software infrastructure that powers the world's most advanced HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) production lines. With HBM capacity sold out through 2026 and every major AI chip company — NVIDIA, AMD, Google TPU — dependent on Micron's output, software engineers directly impact the throughput and yield of the most constrained semiconductor supply chain on the planet (Micron 2025 Annual Report; Levels.fyi Micron compensation data).

**Level Mapping:**
- Micron SWE I/II maps to Google L3/L4, Meta E3/E4, Amazon SDE I/II
- Micron uses a band system (Band 5–6 for SWE) with annual RSU refreshers
- Promotion cadence is typically 2–3 years at the SWE level

**Sold-Out HBM Capacity — The Capacity Guardian Premium**

Micron's HBM capacity is completely sold out through 2026, creating an unprecedented supply bottleneck for every AI training cluster in the world. NVIDIA's H100/H200/B200 GPUs, AMD's MI300X, and Google's TPU v5 all depend on Micron's HBM3E output. As a Software Engineer, you are a Capacity Guardian — your code directly impacts HBM yield optimization, firmware reliability, and production throughput. Every percentage point of yield improvement on HBM translates to hundreds of millions in revenue for Micron and unlocks AI compute capacity that hyperscalers are desperate to secure. This scarcity justifies a 25% memory premium on your total compensation. Frame your negotiation around the fact that Micron cannot afford slow software iteration on HBM-related systems — a single engineer's contribution to yield or firmware stability can protect billions in contracted revenue. Anchor your RSU and base salary asks to this irreplaceable value.

**Global Levers**

1. **HBM Yield Impact:** "My work on firmware and software tooling directly impacts HBM3E yield rates — each 1% yield improvement represents $200M+ in annual revenue given sold-out capacity through 2026."
2. **Competing AI Offers:** "I have competing offers from NVIDIA and AMD software teams where my total comp is 20% above your current offer — companies that are themselves dependent on Micron HBM supply."
3. **RSU Refresh Acceleration:** "Given Micron's stock trajectory tied to AI/HBM demand, I'd like to discuss accelerated RSU vesting or a Year-1 front-load to reflect the immediate value I bring to capacity-critical projects."
4. **Signing Bonus for Relocation:** "Relocating to Boise represents a lifestyle investment — I'd like a $25K–$35K signing bonus to offset transition costs, which is standard for memory semiconductor roles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $125K base and $40K RSUs. Given that Micron's HBM capacity is sold out through 2026 and my firmware optimization experience directly impacts yield on the most constrained memory product in the world, I believe the total comp should reflect a Capacity Guardian premium. I'm targeting $140K base and $55K in RSUs over four years, which brings my total comp to approximately $220K. I have a competing offer from an AI infrastructure company at $215K total comp. I can accept at $205K total comp with a $30K signing bonus, but below that I'd need to seriously consider the competing offer. I'm excited about Micron's HBM roadmap and want to make this work."
