### Engineering Manager | Micron Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Memory & Storage Semiconductor | Sold-Out HBM Capacity | +12% AI/Memory Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boise | $168K–$215K | $65K–$105K | 12–18% | $265K–$368K |
| San Jose | $195K–$250K | $78K–$125K | 12–18% | $310K–$430K |
| Remote US | $174K–$222K | $68K–$108K | 12–18% | $275K–$380K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Micron lead teams of 8–15 engineers building the firmware, software platforms, and test infrastructure that power the world's most advanced memory products. In a company where HBM capacity is sold out and every AI hyperscaler is competing for supply, Engineering Managers are the force multipliers who determine team velocity, retention, and execution against multi-billion-dollar delivery commitments. Micron's EM role blends deep technical ownership with people leadership, and the company expects EMs to make architectural tradeoff decisions alongside their Staff+ engineers (Micron Careers; Levels.fyi Micron EM compensation data, 2024–2025).

**Level Mapping:**
- Micron EM (Band 8) maps to Google M1/L6, Meta M1, Amazon SDM
- Comparable to SK Hynix Engineering Section Lead or Samsung Memory Group Manager
- Senior EM (Band 9) maps to Google M2/L7, Meta M2 — typically requires 15+ directs or multi-team scope

**Sold-Out HBM Capacity — The Capacity Guardian Premium**

Micron's HBM capacity is sold out through 2026, and Engineering Managers are the Capacity Guardians who ensure teams deliver on time and at quality. When NVIDIA, AMD, and Google TPU are all waiting on Micron HBM3E shipments, a single team's execution failure can cascade into billions in delayed AI compute deployment. As an EM, you directly control team velocity, engineer retention, and execution quality on HBM-critical projects — if your team slips a milestone, hyperscalers miss their GPU shipment windows. This makes your role a 25% memory premium position. Frame your negotiation around retention risk: in the current market, every engineer on your team is being recruited by NVIDIA, AMD, and the hyperscalers. Your ability to retain and accelerate a team of 10+ engineers on HBM firmware is worth far more than the incremental compensation you're requesting.

**Global Levers**

1. **Team Retention Value:** "I'll be managing 10–15 engineers on HBM-critical projects, each of whom is being actively recruited by NVIDIA and AMD. My retention leadership alone protects $3M+ in annual team compensation spend."
2. **Execution Risk on Sold-Out Capacity:** "A single sprint slip on HBM firmware can delay shipments worth $100M+ to hyperscaler customers. My track record of on-time delivery directly de-risks Micron's most critical revenue stream."
3. **Competing EM Offers:** "I have a competing EM offer from [NVIDIA/Qualcomm/Broadcom] at $400K total comp. I'm drawn to Micron's HBM mission, but the gap needs to narrow to $360K+ for me to commit."
4. **Signing Bonus for Opportunity Cost:** "Transitioning into an EM role at Micron means I'm forgoing competing IC Staff offers at $420K+. A $40K–$50K signing bonus would bridge that opportunity cost."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $195K base and $80K RSUs. I'm excited about leading the [HBM firmware/memory platform] team at Micron. Given that HBM capacity is sold out through 2026 and my team's execution directly protects billions in contracted hyperscaler revenue, I believe this role warrants Capacity Guardian compensation. I'm targeting $215K base and $105K in RSUs over four years, bringing total comp to approximately $365K. I have a competing EM offer at $395K total comp from a company in the AI infrastructure space. My accept-at floor is $345K total comp with a $40K signing bonus. I want to build and retain a world-class HBM engineering team at Micron."
