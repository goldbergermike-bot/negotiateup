### Security Engineer | Micron Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Memory & Storage Semiconductor | Sold-Out HBM Capacity | +12% AI/Memory Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boise | $128K–$170K | $40K–$65K | 10–15% | $198K–$275K |
| San Jose | $148K–$198K | $50K–$80K | 10–15% | $232K–$322K |
| Remote US | $132K–$175K | $42K–$68K | 10–15% | $205K–$285K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Micron protect the intellectual property, manufacturing systems, and supply chain data of one of the world's three HBM manufacturers. Micron's security threat landscape is uniquely high-stakes: nation-state actors target memory IP, industrial espionage has historically threatened DRAM trade secrets, and the manufacturing execution systems (MES) controlling billion-dollar fabs must be hardened against cyberattack. With HBM capacity sold out through 2026 and every major AI company dependent on Micron's output, the security of Micron's production infrastructure is a matter of global AI supply chain resilience (Micron Technology Security team descriptions; Glassdoor Micron security compensation data, 2024–2025).

**Level Mapping:**
- Micron Security Engineer (Band 6–7) maps to Google Security Engineer L4–L5, Meta Security Engineer E4–E5, Amazon Security Engineer II–III
- Comparable to Intel Security Engineer or Qualcomm Cybersecurity Engineer
- Senior Security (Band 8) requires OT/ICS security expertise specific to semiconductor manufacturing

**Sold-Out HBM Capacity — The Capacity Guardian Premium**

Micron's HBM capacity is sold out through 2026, and Security Engineers are the Capacity Guardians who protect the most strategically important semiconductor production infrastructure in the world. A successful cyberattack on Micron's fab MES systems could halt HBM production for weeks, disrupting every NVIDIA, AMD, and Google AI training cluster deployment globally. A nation-state IP theft could compromise Micron's HBM technology advantage, threatening the company's competitive position in a three-company oligopoly. As a Security Engineer, you stand between these existential threats and billions in contracted HBM revenue. This justifies a 25% memory premium on your compensation. Frame your negotiation around risk quantification: the downside of a major security breach at Micron during sold-out HBM capacity is measured in billions of dollars of lost revenue and customer trust — your compensation is a rounding error compared to the risk you mitigate.

**Global Levers**

1. **Existential Risk Mitigation:** "A single successful attack on Micron's HBM production systems could halt output worth $500M+ per month and disrupt the entire global AI supply chain. My security work prevents existential risk."
2. **OT/ICS Security Scarcity:** "Security engineers with operational technology and industrial control system expertise in semiconductor manufacturing are exceptionally rare — most security talent focuses on cloud/enterprise. My fab security skills command a premium."
3. **Competing Security Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/CrowdStrike/Palo Alto Networks] security team at $305K total comp. While those roles protect software systems, protecting Micron's physical fab infrastructure is higher stakes."
4. **Nation-State Threat Landscape:** "Micron faces documented nation-state threats to its memory IP — the 2018 DRAM IP theft cases demonstrate the stakes. My experience in advanced threat detection directly protects Micron's core competitive advantage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $148K base and $48K RSUs. I'm committed to protecting Micron's HBM production infrastructure and IP. Given that HBM capacity is sold out through 2026 and a security breach on Micron's fab systems would halt the world's most constrained memory supply, I believe this warrants Capacity Guardian-level compensation. I'm targeting $170K base and $65K in RSUs over four years, bringing total comp to approximately $272K. I have a competing security offer at $300K total comp from a cybersecurity company. My accept-at floor is $255K total comp with a $28K signing bonus. I want to be the security engineer protecting the world's most important memory supply chain."
