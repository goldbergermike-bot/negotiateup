#### Negotiation DNA

The Engineering Manager at TPG is a Commercial Engine leader who happens to manage engineers. Since TPG's 2022 IPO, the firm has restructured its technology organization around two meta-themes — AI Infrastructure and Vertical AI Apps — and the Engineering Manager is responsible for building, scaling, and directing the teams that bring these themes to life. This is not a traditional people-management role focused on sprint ceremonies and performance reviews. TPG expects Engineering Managers to operate with a CRO/CGO mindset: owning delivery timelines that directly impact deal execution, staffing decisions that accelerate portfolio company AI integration, and technical roadmaps that create measurable commercial value across TPG's $220B+ AUM platform. You are managing the teams that build AI-driven deal sourcing, portfolio analytics, and investor reporting systems — every hiring decision you make, every architecture tradeoff you approve, every sprint priority you set has downstream revenue implications. Position yourself as a revenue-driving leader who builds high-performing teams, not a process manager who runs standups.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. As an Engineering Manager, you are the force multiplier for this thesis. You don't just build systems — you build the teams that build systems. Your ability to recruit, retain, and direct AI engineering talent directly determines how quickly TPG can execute its Vertical AI strategy.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **Team = Thesis Execution Speed:** TPG's ability to execute on Vertical AI investments depends on having the right engineering teams in place. An Engineering Manager who can recruit top AI talent and ramp them to productivity in 60 days instead of 120 days is worth a significant premium — you are literally accelerating TPG's investment thesis.
- **Portfolio Company Technical Leadership:** Engineering Managers at TPG are often deployed as technical advisors to portfolio companies, especially in healthcare AI, fintech AI, and enterprise AI. You are not just managing an internal team — you are providing technical leadership that increases the value of billion-dollar investments. This cross-portfolio leverage should be priced into your compensation.
- **Commercial Engine Ownership:** TPG evaluates Engineering Managers on commercial outcomes, not engineering process metrics. "I managed a team of 10 engineers" becomes "I led the team that built TPG's AI-driven deal sourcing platform, which identified $3B in investment opportunities in its first year." Frame every management accomplishment in revenue terms.
- **AI Talent Scarcity:** The market for engineering managers with AI Infrastructure experience and financial services context is extremely tight. If you can recruit, retain, and lead AI engineers while understanding TPG's investment workflow, you occupy a niche that commands top-of-band compensation.

Engineering Managers with prior experience leading AI teams in financial services or enterprise AI should negotiate a management equity premium — an additional $50K-$80K in RSUs above the IC equivalent, reflecting the organizational leverage a strong manager provides.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Team-Building Track Record Premium**
   > "I've built and scaled engineering teams from [X] to [Y] engineers at [previous company], with a 90%+ retention rate and an average time-to-productivity of 45 days for new hires. At TPG, this translates directly to thesis execution speed — I can build the AI Infrastructure team you need 2-3x faster than a typical manager. I'd like the RSU package to reflect this organizational leverage: $340K+ over 4 years."

2. **Lever 2 — Portfolio Company Advisory Value**
   > "I understand that TPG's Engineering Managers serve as technical advisors to portfolio companies. In my previous role, I provided this type of advisory to [X] companies, helping them implement AI solutions that drove $[Y]M in value creation. This dual role — managing an internal team while advising portfolio companies — creates a multiplied impact that should be reflected in a top-of-band offer, specifically $270K+ base."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Calibration**
   > "I'm evaluating offers from [Blackstone VP Engineering / KKR Tech Manager / Google EM / Meta EM] ranging from $540K-$640K total comp. TPG's Vertical AI thesis is uniquely compelling, but I need the compensation to reflect the management premium. I'm looking for $265K+ base, $350K+ RSUs over 4 years, and a $60K signing bonus."

4. **Lever 4 — Retention & Growth Alignment**
   > "As a manager, my value compounds over time — the team I build in Year 1 delivers increasing returns in Years 2-4. I'd like to structure the equity to reflect this: front-loaded RSU vesting (35/30/20/15) plus a guaranteed annual refresh of $80K-$100K in new RSUs, contingent on team delivery milestones. I'd also like to discuss co-investment rights in TPG's funds for management-level employees."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $275K base in San Francisco with $360K RSU/4yr and a $60K signing bonus. Anchor with competing offers from Blackstone VP Engineering ($260K base + carry), Google EM ($280K base + $400K RSU), or KKR Tech Manager ($255K base + co-invest). If TPG opens at $225K base, counter with: "My current offer set averages $580K total comp with management-level equity. I prefer TPG's thesis-driven culture, but I need $260K+ base and $320K+ RSUs to accept. I also want a written commitment to annual RSU refreshes of $80K+." Walk-away floor: $250K base and $300K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $225K+ base and $260K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $248K+ base and $290K+ RSUs. Signing bonus is a separate negotiation — target $50K-$75K.
