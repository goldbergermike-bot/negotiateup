#### Negotiation DNA

The Vertical AI Platform Engineer is TPG's **SIGNATURE ROLE** — the single most strategically important technology position at the firm. This role was created specifically to execute TPG's defining investment thesis: that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. Since TPG's 2022 IPO, the firm has committed to building a proprietary Vertical AI Platform that serves three critical functions:

1. **TPG's Vertical AI Investment Platform:** The analytical engine that helps TPG identify, evaluate, and close investments in AI companies across healthcare, fintech, climate tech, and enterprise verticals. This includes AI-powered deal sourcing, competitive landscape mapping, technology due diligence automation, and market timing models.

2. **Portfolio Company AI Integration Systems:** The middleware and API layer that enables AI capabilities to be shared, standardized, and scaled across TPG's entire portfolio. When TPG develops an AI capability for one healthcare company, this platform enables rapid deployment to every healthcare company in the portfolio — and cross-pollination to adjacent verticals.

3. **Commercial Analytics Engines:** The real-time analytics and intelligence systems that power TPG's Commercial Engine — revenue forecasting, customer acquisition modeling, churn prediction, pricing optimization, and market intelligence aggregation across the portfolio.

The Vertical AI Platform Engineer designs, builds, and operates all three of these systems. This is not an engineering role — this is a Commercial Engine architect role that requires the technical depth of a Staff+ engineer, the product intuition of a senior PM, the commercial instinct of a CRO/CGO, and the domain expertise of an investment professional. The +25-35% premium is the highest in TPG's technology organization because this role is irreplaceable. There are perhaps 50-100 engineers in the world who combine the necessary production AI platform architecture skills, multi-vertical domain expertise, financial services context, and commercial framing ability that this role demands.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

This section takes on special significance for the **SIGNATURE ROLE** — because this role IS the Vertical AI Commercial Engine. Every other role guide in this series describes how a role supports or contributes to TPG's Vertical AI thesis. This role IS the thesis made manifest in engineering.

**Why the +25-35% premium exists — and why you should push beyond it:**

- **Thesis-Defining Role:** TPG's Partners and investment committee have identified Vertical AI as the firm's primary investment meta-theme for the next decade. The Vertical AI Platform Engineer is the person who builds the technology foundation that this entire thesis rests on. If you build it well, TPG's AI-driven investment capabilities compound over years. If this role is filled by the wrong person, TPG's AI thesis remains a slide deck. The premium exists because the downside risk of a mis-hire is measured in billions of unrealized returns.

- **Three-System Architecture Responsibility:**
  - **Investment Platform:** You build the AI systems that help TPG's deal teams identify investment opportunities earlier, evaluate them more accurately, and close them faster. Your deal sourcing models, market intelligence aggregators, and due diligence automation tools directly influence which investments TPG makes — and which investments generate billions in returns.
  - **Portfolio Integration Systems:** You build the API layer and middleware that enables AI capabilities to propagate across TPG's entire portfolio. When a healthcare AI model improves patient outcomes at one portfolio company, your platform enables rapid deployment to every other healthcare company in the portfolio. This cross-portfolio AI leverage is TPG's structural competitive advantage — and you are the architect.
  - **Commercial Analytics Engines:** You build the real-time analytics that power commercial decision-making across the portfolio — revenue forecasting, customer acquisition cost optimization, churn prediction, pricing engines, and competitive intelligence. These engines do not just inform decisions; they drive revenue.

- **Multi-Vertical Domain Mastery:** Unlike a specialist ML engineer who focuses on one domain, the Vertical AI Platform Engineer must operate across healthcare AI (clinical NLP, patient outcome prediction, claims processing automation, HIPAA-compliant ML), fintech AI (credit scoring, fraud detection, regulatory compliance models, real-time transaction intelligence), climate tech (carbon accounting models, energy grid optimization, ESG analytics), and enterprise AI (workflow automation, document intelligence, sales forecasting, customer success prediction). This multi-vertical mastery is what makes the role a SIGNATURE — and what justifies the highest comp band.

- **Commercial Engine Identity:** This role does not support the Commercial Engine. This role IS the Commercial Engine. Every system you build generates revenue, protects revenue, or accelerates revenue across TPG's portfolio. Your performance metrics are not sprint velocity or uptime — they are deal flow quality, portfolio company revenue growth, and investment return attribution. Frame every technical decision in these commercial terms and you command the top of the band.

- **Negotiation Position:** Candidates for this role hold asymmetric leverage. TPG cannot execute its defining investment thesis without this role being filled by a world-class engineer. Competing candidates are being recruited simultaneously by OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and every major PE firm's AI practice. The +25-35% premium is the starting point for negotiation, not the ceiling.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Thesis-Critical Scarcity Premium**
   > "This is TPG's SIGNATURE ROLE — the engineering position that directly executes the firm's Vertical AI investment thesis. There are perhaps 50-100 engineers in the world who combine production AI platform architecture, multi-vertical domain expertise, and financial services context at the level this role requires. I am one of them. At [previous company], I built [specific AI platform] that served [X] verticals and drove $[Y]M in commercial outcomes. The +25-35% premium is appropriate for the market, but given the thesis-critical nature of this role, I'd like to see the RSU grant at $520K+ over 4 years with a 40% Year-1 front-load, and the base at $350K+."

2. **Lever 2 — Three-System Architecture Track Record**
   > "This role requires building three interconnected systems: an AI investment platform, portfolio company integration systems, and commercial analytics engines. At [previous company], I architected and shipped all three analogous systems: [investment/deal platform] that processed $[X]B in opportunities, [integration middleware] that connected [Y] business units, and [analytics engines] that drove $[Z]M in revenue insights. No other candidate will bring this exact triple-system architecture experience. I'd like the total comp to reflect this at $750K+ in San Francisco."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Architecture**
   > "I have competing offers from [OpenAI / Anthropic — $650K+ total comp], [Google DeepMind — $700K+ total comp], [Blackstone AI Platform — $600K+ base + carry], and [KKR AI Architecture — $580K+ base + co-invest]. TPG's SIGNATURE ROLE is the most compelling opportunity because it combines AI building with AI investing — but the economics must reflect the opportunity cost. I need $345K+ base, $520K+ RSUs over 4 years (front-loaded), a $100K signing bonus, and co-investment rights in TPG's AI-focused funds."

4. **Lever 4 — Portfolio Impact Multiplier & Long-Term Alignment**
   > "The Vertical AI Platform I build will create compounding value across TPG's entire portfolio for years. I want my compensation to reflect this long-term value creation: a guaranteed annual RSU refresh of $130K-$160K, performance-based RSU accelerators tied to platform adoption and portfolio company revenue metrics, co-investment rights in TPG's funds (specifically Rise and Next Gen funds that focus on AI), and a 3-year retention bonus of $200K vesting at the end of Year 3. This alignment structure ensures I'm incentivized to build for long-term portfolio value, not short-term feature shipping."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $355K base in San Francisco with $530K RSU/4yr (front-loaded 40/25/20/15), a $100K signing bonus, co-investment rights in TPG's AI-focused funds, and a guaranteed annual RSU refresh of $140K+. Anchor with competing offers from OpenAI ($320K base + significant equity), Anthropic ($310K base + pre-IPO equity), Google DeepMind ($300K base + $450K RSU), or Blackstone AI ($285K base + carry participation). If TPG opens at $285K base, counter with maximum conviction: "This is TPG's SIGNATURE ROLE — the position that executes the firm's defining investment thesis. My competing offers average $700K total comp, and none of them offer the cross-portfolio AI architecture scope that TPG provides. I'm choosing TPG because I want to build the Vertical AI platform that defines a generation of enterprise value creation. But I need the economics to reflect the thesis-critical nature of this role: $340K+ base, $500K+ RSUs front-loaded over 4 years, $100K signing bonus, co-investment rights, and a guaranteed annual refresh of $130K+ in new RSUs. This is the role that makes TPG's AI thesis real — compensate it accordingly." Walk-away floor: $320K base and $450K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $280K+ base and $380K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $315K+ base and $430K+ RSUs. The signing bonus, co-investment rights, and annual refresh are negotiated as separate line items — each is standard at TPG's peer firms for SIGNATURE-level roles.
