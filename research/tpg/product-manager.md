#### Negotiation DNA

The Product Manager at TPG is a Commercial Engine leader who owns the "what" and "why" behind every technology investment the firm makes in its internal platforms. Since TPG's 2022 IPO, product management has become a strategic function — not an order-taking role. TPG's twin meta-themes of AI Infrastructure and Vertical AI Apps require product leaders who can translate investment thesis into product roadmap, define AI-powered features that accelerate deal origination and portfolio value creation, and prioritize ruthlessly across the needs of investment teams, portfolio companies, and LP reporting. At TPG, the Product Manager sits at the intersection of technology and revenue. You define what the engineering team builds, and what they build directly impacts how TPG deploys its $220B+ AUM. This is a CRO/CGO-adjacent role: you are not managing a backlog — you are managing a revenue pipeline expressed as a product roadmap. Candidates should position themselves as commercial product leaders who drive measurable business outcomes, not feature-shipping PMs who optimize velocity metrics.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. As a Product Manager, you define what "Vertical AI" looks like in practice. You translate the investment thesis into product requirements, user stories, and success metrics that the engineering team executes against.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **Thesis-to-Product Translation:** You are the bridge between TPG's investment professionals and its technology teams. When TPG invests in a healthcare AI company, you define the portfolio integration product that connects that company's data into TPG's analytics platform. When TPG evaluates a fintech AI acquisition target, you specify the due diligence tooling that accelerates the decision. This bridge role is commercially critical.
- **AI Product Expertise:** Product Managers who understand AI/ML product development — including prompt engineering, model evaluation, data pipeline design, and AI UX patterns — command a premium at TPG. The firm needs PMs who can make informed tradeoffs between build-vs-buy for AI capabilities, evaluate AI vendor claims with technical rigor, and design AI-powered features that investment professionals actually use.
- **Cross-Vertical Prioritization:** TPG's portfolio spans healthcare AI, fintech AI, climate tech, and enterprise AI. The Product Manager must prioritize across these verticals, making resource allocation decisions that maximize aggregate portfolio value. This strategic prioritization skill is far more valuable than standard PM backlog management.
- **Revenue Metric Fluency:** TPG evaluates PMs on commercial outcomes. "I launched 12 features" becomes "I defined and launched an AI-driven deal scoring product that increased the investment team's hit rate by 25%, contributing to $1.2B in successful deal closings."

Product Managers with AI product experience in healthcare, fintech, or enterprise SaaS verticals should negotiate a 10-15% premium on the RSU component by demonstrating domain-specific product leadership.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — AI Product Leadership Premium**
   > "I've shipped AI-powered products at [previous company] that generated $[X]M in revenue. My experience with [LLM-powered features / ML-driven recommendations / AI workflow automation] directly applies to TPG's Vertical AI product roadmap. Product Managers with production AI product experience are commanding $380K-$430K total comp at competing firms. I'd like the RSU component to reflect this at $200K+ over 4 years."

2. **Lever 2 — Commercial Impact Framing**
   > "I see the PM role at TPG as a Commercial Engine function — every product decision I make has revenue implications across a $220B AUM platform. At [previous company], I owned a product line that drove $[X]M in annual revenue and reduced customer acquisition cost by [Y]%. I want my compensation to reflect this revenue-driving orientation, not a support-function PM salary."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Anchoring**
   > "I have offers from [Google PM / Meta PM / Blackstone Product / Vista PM] at $[X]K total comp. TPG's Vertical AI thesis is the most exciting product challenge on my list, but I need the offer to reflect the commercial scope of this role. I'm targeting $215K+ base and $210K+ RSUs over 4 years."

4. **Lever 4 — Strategic Scope Premium**
   > "This PM role at TPG is not a typical product management position — it's a cross-portfolio strategic product role that impacts every investment vertical. At [previous company], I operated at a similar scope across [X] business units and was compensated as a Senior/Staff PM. I'd like TPG's offer to reflect the strategic scope: top-of-band base plus a guaranteed annual refresh of $50K-$70K in new RSUs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $220K base in San Francisco with $220K RSU/4yr and a $40K signing bonus. Anchor with competing offers from Google PM ($210K base + $250K RSU), Vista PM ($200K base + profit sharing), or Blackstone Product ($195K base + carry). If TPG opens at $175K base, counter with: "My competing offer from [Google/Meta] is at $400K total comp. I'm choosing TPG because the Vertical AI product challenge is unique, but I need $210K+ base and $200K+ RSUs to make the move." Walk-away floor: $200K base and $180K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $178K+ base and $155K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $198K+ base and $175K+ RSUs. Signing bonus should be a separate $30K-$50K negotiation.
