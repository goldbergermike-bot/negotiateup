#### Negotiation DNA

The Software Engineer at TPG is not a traditional back-office developer maintaining internal tools. Since TPG's 2022 IPO and its strategic pivot toward AI Infrastructure and Vertical AI Apps as core investment meta-themes, every engineering hire is evaluated through a Commercial Engine lens. You are building the systems that power deal flow analytics, portfolio company performance dashboards, AI-driven due diligence tooling, and investor-facing platforms that directly influence the firm's $220B+ AUM trajectory. TPG expects engineers who understand that code translates to commercial outcomes — every feature shipped accelerates revenue capture across healthcare AI, fintech AI, climate tech, and enterprise AI verticals. Position yourself as a revenue-multiplier, not a ticket-closer.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. As a Software Engineer, this thesis directly shapes your negotiation leverage. TPG does not hire engineers to maintain legacy systems — they hire engineers who will build the Commercial Engine that powers AI-driven investment decisions.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **Portfolio Integration Value:** Every system you build touches TPG's portfolio companies across healthcare AI (patient outcome prediction), fintech AI (risk modeling), climate tech (carbon analytics), and enterprise AI (workflow automation). You are not a cost center; you are a value-creation center.
- **AI Infrastructure Fluency:** If you bring experience with LLM orchestration, vector databases, inference optimization, or ML pipelines, you command a premium. TPG needs engineers who can evaluate and integrate AI infrastructure across its portfolio — this is a revenue-driving skill, not a support function.
- **Commercial Narrative:** Frame every technical accomplishment in commercial terms. "I reduced API latency by 40ms" becomes "I accelerated deal-flow processing speed, enabling the investment team to evaluate 30% more opportunities per quarter."

Candidates with demonstrable Vertical AI experience (building domain-specific AI applications in healthcare, fintech, or enterprise SaaS) should push for the top of the band and negotiate a +10-15% premium on RSU grants by citing the scarcity of engineers who understand both AI infrastructure and vertical market dynamics.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — AI Infrastructure Experience Premium**
   > "My experience building [specific AI infrastructure — e.g., ML pipelines, LLM orchestration layers, vector search systems] directly maps to TPG's AI Infrastructure investment thesis. Engineers with this dual competency — production AI systems plus financial services context — are commanding $310K-$360K total comp at competing firms. I'd like the RSU component to reflect this scarcity."

2. **Lever 2 — Portfolio Impact Framing**
   > "I understand that TPG's engineering function is a Commercial Engine, not a support team. In my previous role, I built systems that directly drove $[X]M in revenue / reduced customer churn by [Y]% / accelerated deal processing by [Z]%. I want my compensation to reflect my ability to create measurable portfolio value, not just ship features."

3. **Lever 3 — Geographic Arbitrage (Fort Worth vs. SF)**
   > "I'm open to Fort Worth, but I want to ensure my RSU package reflects San Francisco-competitive rates, given that I'll be contributing to the same AI infrastructure platform. Fort Worth cost-of-living savings should benefit me as well as TPG — I'm proposing we split the differential by keeping my RSUs at SF-level while adjusting base to Fort Worth market."

4. **Lever 4 — Public Equity Upside Narrative**
   > "TPG's public equity (NASDAQ: TPG) gives me visibility into the upside. I'd like to negotiate a refresh grant clause — if TPG stock appreciates above $[target] within 18 months, I'd like an accelerated refresh discussion rather than waiting for the standard annual cycle. This aligns my incentives with shareholder value creation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $180K base in San Francisco with $160K RSU/4yr and a $35K signing bonus. Use competing offers from Blackstone ($170K base) or Vista Equity ($175K base + carry participation) to anchor high. If TPG opens at $155K base, counter with: "I have a competing offer at $175K base with equivalent equity. I prefer TPG's Vertical AI thesis and would accept at $175K+ base and $150K+ RSUs over 4 years." Walk-away floor: $165K base and $130K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $150K+ base and $120K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $170K+ base and $140K+ RSUs. Always negotiate the signing bonus separately — it is not part of the TC band and can add $25K-$50K.
