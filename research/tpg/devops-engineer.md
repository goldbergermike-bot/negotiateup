#### Negotiation DNA

The DevOps Engineer at TPG is the infrastructure backbone of the firm's Commercial Engine. Since TPG's 2022 IPO and its strategic investment in AI Infrastructure and Vertical AI Apps, DevOps has evolved from a traditional ops role into a revenue-critical function. Every AI model TPG deploys, every analytics dashboard TPG's deal teams rely on, every portfolio company integration TPG builds — all of it runs on infrastructure that you design, deploy, and maintain. Downtime is not an engineering inconvenience; it is a commercial disruption that delays investment decisions affecting billions in AUM. At TPG, DevOps engineers are evaluated not on uptime SLAs but on deployment velocity — how fast the engineering team can ship new AI-powered features to production — and infrastructure cost efficiency — how well the platform scales without linear cost growth. You are a revenue enabler, not a server babysitter. Position yourself as an infrastructure commercial leader who ensures TPG's AI engine runs faster, cheaper, and more reliably than competitors' systems.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. As a DevOps Engineer, you are the person who makes AI Infrastructure operationally real. Without reliable, scalable, cost-efficient infrastructure, TPG's Vertical AI strategy remains a thesis on a slide — not a production system generating returns.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **AI Infrastructure Is Your Domain:** TPG's investment in AI requires specialized infrastructure — GPU clusters, model serving infrastructure, vector database operations, ML pipeline orchestration, and real-time inference endpoints. DevOps engineers who can operate this AI-specific infrastructure are significantly more valuable than traditional DevOps engineers managing web application deployments. If you bring AI Ops experience, you command a 10-15% premium.
- **Deployment Velocity = Revenue Velocity:** At TPG, the speed at which new AI features reach production directly impacts how quickly the firm can act on investment opportunities. If you can reduce deployment cycle time from days to hours, you are literally accelerating revenue. Frame your DevOps accomplishments in these terms.
- **Portfolio Infrastructure Consulting:** DevOps engineers at TPG are sometimes deployed to advise portfolio companies on infrastructure modernization, particularly for healthcare AI (HIPAA-compliant cloud), fintech AI (PCI-DSS infrastructure), and enterprise AI (multi-tenant SaaS deployment). If you bring compliance-aware infrastructure expertise, you add value beyond the internal team.
- **Cost Optimization as Revenue:** Cloud infrastructure costs for AI workloads can be enormous. A DevOps engineer who reduces GPU compute costs by 30% through spot instance strategies, model optimization, or inference batching creates direct bottom-line value. "I saved $2M in annual cloud costs" is a revenue story at TPG.

DevOps engineers with AI Ops experience (GPU management, model serving, ML pipeline infrastructure) should negotiate a 10-15% premium on both base and RSU components.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — AI Ops Specialization Premium**
   > "My experience operating AI infrastructure — including [GPU cluster management / model serving platforms / ML pipeline orchestration / vector database operations] — directly maps to TPG's AI Infrastructure needs. DevOps engineers with production AI Ops experience are commanding $310K-$358K total comp. Traditional DevOps skills are commodity; AI Ops skills are premium. I'd like the offer to reflect this at $195K+ base and $145K+ RSUs."

2. **Lever 2 — Deployment Velocity = Revenue Velocity**
   > "At [previous company], I reduced deployment cycle time from [X days] to [Y hours], enabling the engineering team to ship features [Z]x faster. At TPG, this deployment velocity directly accelerates the firm's ability to act on AI-driven investment insights. I'm a revenue accelerator, and I'd like my compensation to reflect that commercial impact."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Calibration**
   > "I have offers from [Google SRE / AWS Platform / Blackstone Infra / top fintech] ranging from $280K-$355K total comp. TPG's AI Infrastructure thesis is compelling, but I need the economics to match the specialized AI Ops scope. I'm targeting $200K+ base and $150K+ RSUs over 4 years."

4. **Lever 4 — Cost Optimization Value**
   > "I have a track record of reducing cloud infrastructure costs by [X]% while improving performance — at [previous company], this saved $[Y]M annually. At TPG, with AI workloads driving significant compute costs, my infrastructure optimization skills directly improve the firm's operating margin. I'd like a performance component tied to infrastructure cost savings, plus top-of-band RSUs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $205K base in San Francisco with $155K RSU/4yr and a $30K signing bonus. Anchor with competing offers from Google SRE ($200K base + $180K RSU), AWS ($195K base + $160K RSU), or Blackstone Infra ($185K base + carry). If TPG opens at $168K base, counter with: "My competing offers average $325K total comp. I'm choosing TPG for the AI Infrastructure challenge, but I need $195K+ base and $140K+ RSUs to accept." Walk-away floor: $185K base and $125K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $165K+ base and $110K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $182K+ base and $120K+ RSUs. Signing bonus is a separate $25K-$40K negotiation.
