#### Negotiation DNA

The Data Scientist at TPG is the quantitative backbone of the firm's Commercial Engine. Since TPG's 2022 IPO and its strategic pivot toward AI Infrastructure and Vertical AI Apps, data science has moved from a back-office analytics function to a front-line commercial capability. At a firm managing $220B+ in assets, the Data Scientist builds the models, algorithms, and analytical frameworks that directly inform investment decisions — deal scoring models that predict returns, portfolio company health dashboards that trigger value creation interventions, market signal detection systems that identify opportunities before competitors, and LP reporting analytics that demonstrate fund performance. This is not a research role where you publish papers — this is a revenue-driving role where your models move capital. TPG expects Data Scientists who think like commercial leaders: every model you build should have a measurable revenue impact, every insight you surface should accelerate a decision, and every analysis you produce should strengthen TPG's competitive position. Position yourself as a quantitative commercial leader, not a back-office analyst.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. As a Data Scientist, you are the person who proves or disproves this thesis with data. Your models evaluate AI companies in TPG's investment pipeline, your analytics measure AI-driven value creation in portfolio companies, and your insights shape how TPG deploys capital into vertical AI opportunities.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **Investment Decision Influence:** Your models directly inform billion-dollar capital allocation decisions. A deal scoring model that correctly identifies a top-decile investment opportunity generates hundreds of millions in returns for TPG. This influence on investment outcomes is fundamentally different from a data scientist role at a tech company where you optimize click-through rates. Price this influence accordingly.
- **Vertical AI Domain Modeling:** TPG's portfolio spans healthcare AI (patient outcome prediction, clinical trial optimization), fintech AI (credit risk modeling, fraud detection), climate tech (carbon footprint analytics, energy grid optimization), and enterprise AI (churn prediction, revenue forecasting). Data Scientists who bring domain-specific modeling expertise in any of these verticals can accelerate TPG's ability to evaluate and create value in AI companies. This domain expertise commands a 10-20% premium.
- **AI Infrastructure Evaluation:** Data Scientists at TPG evaluate the AI Infrastructure of potential investment targets — assessing model quality, data moat defensibility, inference costs, and scalability. If you can perform this technical due diligence, you are contributing directly to investment decision quality, which is the highest-leverage activity at the firm.
- **Quantitative Storytelling:** TPG evaluates Data Scientists on their ability to translate quantitative findings into commercial narratives for investment committees. "My model achieved 0.92 AUC" becomes "My deal scoring model correctly identified 8 of the 10 top-performing investments in the portfolio, and flagging these opportunities 3 months earlier would have generated an additional $400M in returns."

Data Scientists with experience in financial services AI, healthcare AI, or enterprise SaaS analytics should negotiate for top-of-band RSUs plus a performance bonus tied to model impact on investment outcomes.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Investment Decision Impact Premium**
   > "My models will directly inform how TPG deploys billions in capital. At [previous company], I built a [deal scoring / risk assessment / market prediction] model that influenced $[X]B in investment decisions with a [Y]% accuracy rate. Data Scientists who operate at this level of investment influence are commanding $420K-$480K total comp at competing firms. I'd like the RSU component to reflect this at $240K+ over 4 years."

2. **Lever 2 — Vertical AI Domain Expertise**
   > "I bring deep domain expertise in [healthcare AI / fintech AI / enterprise AI] modeling, including [specific models — e.g., patient outcome prediction, credit risk scoring, revenue forecasting]. This domain knowledge directly accelerates TPG's ability to evaluate and create value in its Vertical AI portfolio companies. I'd like a domain expertise premium of 15% on the RSU grant."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Anchoring**
   > "I'm evaluating offers from [Two Sigma / Citadel / Blackstone Quant / Google DS] ranging from $400K-$480K total comp. TPG's Vertical AI thesis is uniquely compelling for a data scientist because of the cross-vertical exposure, but I need the economics to match. I'm targeting $240K+ base and $250K+ RSUs over 4 years."

4. **Lever 4 — Quantitative Infrastructure Value**
   > "Beyond individual models, I bring experience building reusable quantitative infrastructure — feature stores, model registries, experiment tracking platforms, and automated retraining pipelines. At TPG, this infrastructure would accelerate every data scientist and analyst on the team. I'd like this organizational leverage reflected in a guaranteed annual refresh of $60K-$80K in new RSUs, plus a performance bonus tied to portfolio analytics adoption metrics."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $242K base in San Francisco with $255K RSU/4yr and a $45K signing bonus. Anchor with competing offers from Two Sigma ($250K base + performance bonus), Blackstone Quant ($230K base + carry), or Google DS ($235K base + $280K RSU). If TPG opens at $195K base, counter with: "My competing offers average $445K total comp. I'm drawn to TPG's cross-vertical AI data science challenge, but I need $232K+ base and $235K+ RSUs to accept. I'd also like a performance bonus component tied to model impact." Walk-away floor: $220K base and $215K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $195K+ base and $185K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $218K+ base and $210K+ RSUs. Signing bonus is a separate $35K-$55K negotiation.
