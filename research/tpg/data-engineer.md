#### Negotiation DNA

The Data Engineer at TPG is the foundation builder of the firm's AI Infrastructure. Since TPG's 2022 IPO and its strategic commitment to Vertical AI Apps, every AI model, every analytics dashboard, every AI-driven investment insight depends on data pipelines that are reliable, fast, and properly governed. At a firm managing $220B+ in assets, the Data Engineer does not build pipelines for academic data warehousing — they build the data infrastructure that powers real-time investment decisions, portfolio company performance monitoring, LP reporting, and cross-portfolio AI applications. Data is the fuel for TPG's Commercial Engine, and the Data Engineer is responsible for ensuring that fuel is clean, abundant, and flowing efficiently. TPG expects Data Engineers who think like commercial leaders: every pipeline you build should accelerate a revenue-generating process, every data model you design should enable a business decision, and every integration you deploy should create cross-portfolio value. Position yourself as a data infrastructure commercial leader, not a backend ETL developer.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. As a Data Engineer, you build the data layer that every Vertical AI application depends on. Without clean, well-structured, efficiently flowing data, TPG's AI models are useless — and its Vertical AI investments cannot be properly evaluated or enhanced.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **Data Is the AI Moat:** TPG evaluates AI companies partly based on their data moat — proprietary data that makes their AI models uniquely valuable. As TPG's Data Engineer, you build the internal data moat: aggregated portfolio company data, deal flow analytics, market intelligence, and LP behavior patterns. This data infrastructure is strategically valuable, not just operationally necessary.
- **Cross-Portfolio Data Integration:** TPG's portfolio includes companies across healthcare AI, fintech AI, climate tech, and enterprise AI. The Data Engineer designs data integration architectures that allow insights to flow across these verticals — for example, connecting healthcare outcome data with fintech risk models, or correlating climate data with portfolio company performance. This cross-portfolio integration creates value that no individual portfolio company could generate alone.
- **AI-Ready Data Pipelines:** Traditional ETL is not sufficient for AI workloads. TPG needs data engineers who can build feature stores, streaming data pipelines for real-time inference, data quality monitoring for ML training sets, and vector embedding pipelines for LLM applications. If you bring AI-specific data engineering experience, you command a 10-15% premium.
- **Regulatory Data Compliance:** Data handling across healthcare (HIPAA), finance (SOC 2, GDPR), and AI governance requires compliance-aware data engineering. If you can build data pipelines that are both performant and compliant, you enable TPG to share and leverage data that competitors cannot — creating commercial advantage from compliance expertise.

Data Engineers with AI data pipeline experience (feature stores, vector databases, streaming ML pipelines) or financial services data engineering background should negotiate top-of-band compensation with a data infrastructure premium.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — AI Data Infrastructure Premium**
   > "I build the data infrastructure that AI models depend on — including [feature stores / streaming pipelines / vector embedding systems / data quality frameworks for ML]. Traditional data engineering is commodity; AI-ready data engineering is premium. At [previous company], I built data pipelines that powered [X] ML models serving [Y] million predictions daily. I'd like the offer to reflect this AI data expertise at $228K+ base and $185K+ RSUs."

2. **Lever 2 — Cross-Portfolio Data Value**
   > "What excites me about TPG is the cross-portfolio data integration opportunity. I can build data architectures that connect insights across healthcare AI, fintech AI, and enterprise AI portfolio companies — creating aggregate intelligence that no individual company could generate. At [previous company], I designed a similar cross-business-unit data platform that unlocked $[X]M in value. I'd like a top-of-band offer reflecting this cross-portfolio impact."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Anchoring**
   > "I have offers from [Snowflake / Databricks / Blackstone Data / Google DE] ranging from $325K-$405K total comp. TPG's cross-portfolio data challenge is uniquely compelling, but the economics need to match. I'm targeting $230K+ base and $190K+ RSUs over 4 years."

4. **Lever 4 — Data Governance as Commercial Enabler**
   > "I bring experience building compliant data pipelines across regulated industries — [HIPAA / PCI-DSS / SOC 2 / GDPR]. At TPG, this compliance expertise enables data sharing and AI model training across portfolio companies that competitors cannot do. This is not a cost-of-doing-business capability; it is a commercial advantage. I'd like a compliance expertise premium of 10% on the RSU grant, plus a guaranteed annual refresh of $50K-$65K in new RSUs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $230K base in San Francisco with $190K RSU/4yr and a $35K signing bonus. Anchor with competing offers from Databricks ($225K base + $210K RSU), Snowflake ($220K base + $195K RSU), or Blackstone Data ($210K base + carry). If TPG opens at $185K base, counter with: "My competing offers average $370K total comp. I'm drawn to TPG's cross-portfolio AI data challenge, but I need $222K+ base and $178K+ RSUs to move forward." Walk-away floor: $210K base and $165K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $185K+ base and $138K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $205K+ base and $158K+ RSUs. Signing bonus is a separate $28K-$45K negotiation.
