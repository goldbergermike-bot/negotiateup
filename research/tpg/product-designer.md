#### Negotiation DNA

The Product Designer at TPG is not designing consumer apps or marketing websites. Since TPG's 2022 IPO and its strategic commitment to AI Infrastructure and Vertical AI Apps, the Product Designer owns the experience layer of TPG's Commercial Engine — the interfaces through which investment professionals, portfolio company leaders, and LPs interact with AI-powered analytics, deal flow tools, and reporting systems. At a firm managing $220B+ in assets, design decisions directly impact user adoption and workflow efficiency for some of the highest-value knowledge workers in finance. A well-designed AI dashboard that reduces analysis time by 30 minutes per deal means TPG's team can evaluate more opportunities faster. A poorly designed LP reporting interface creates friction that erodes investor confidence. The Product Designer at TPG operates with a CRO/CGO mindset — understanding that every design decision has commercial consequences. Position yourself as a revenue-enabling designer who understands both AI interaction patterns and financial professional workflows, not a pixel-pusher focused on visual aesthetics.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. As a Product Designer, you define how these vertical AI applications look, feel, and function for end users. The experience layer is where thesis meets adoption — the best AI model in the world is useless if the interface is unusable.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **AI UX Is the Adoption Bottleneck:** TPG's investment in AI Infrastructure only generates returns when humans adopt and trust the AI-powered tools. You are the person who designs that trust. Conversational AI interfaces, confidence scoring visualizations, explainable AI dashboards, and human-in-the-loop workflows are all design challenges that require specialized expertise. If you bring AI UX experience, you command a premium.
- **High-Value User Base:** Your users are managing billions of dollars. A design improvement that saves each deal team member 20 minutes per day creates enormous aggregate value across TPG's investment operations. Frame your design contributions in time-saved, decisions-accelerated, and errors-prevented terms.
- **Vertical-Specific Design:** Healthcare AI requires HIPAA-conscious design patterns. Fintech AI requires real-time data visualization at scale. Climate tech requires scientific data presentation. Enterprise AI requires workflow integration design. If you bring vertical-specific design expertise, you are solving TPG's portfolio company design challenges — not just internal tool design.
- **Design System as Commercial Infrastructure:** At TPG, a well-built design system is not an aesthetic luxury — it is commercial infrastructure that accelerates the speed at which new AI features can be designed, built, and deployed across the portfolio. If you can build and maintain this system, you are a force multiplier.

Designers with AI UX or financial services design experience should negotiate a 10-15% premium on the RSU component and frame their portfolio review around commercial impact metrics rather than visual aesthetics.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — AI UX Specialization Premium**
   > "I bring specific experience designing AI-powered interfaces — including [conversational AI / ML-driven dashboards / explainable AI visualizations / human-in-the-loop workflows]. This specialization is critical for TPG's Vertical AI products and is extremely scarce in the market. Designers with production AI UX experience are commanding $280K-$315K total comp. I'd like the RSU component to reflect this at $120K+ over 4 years."

2. **Lever 2 — High-Value User Impact**
   > "At TPG, my design work will be used by investment professionals managing billions in assets. At [previous company], I redesigned an analytics dashboard used by [similar high-value users], reducing decision time by [X]% and increasing feature adoption by [Y]%. This isn't consumer app design — it's Commercial Engine design, and I'd like the base to reflect that at $175K+."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Calibration**
   > "I'm evaluating offers from [Google / Meta / Blackstone / top-tier fintech] ranging from $265K-$310K total comp. TPG's Vertical AI design challenge is the most interesting opportunity on my list, but the economics need to be competitive. I'm targeting $175K+ base and $125K+ RSUs over 4 years."

4. **Lever 4 — Design System Leverage**
   > "I have experience building and scaling design systems that serve [X] products and [Y] designers. At TPG, a well-architected design system would accelerate AI feature delivery across the portfolio. This infrastructure contribution goes beyond individual feature design — it's a multiplier on the entire product organization's velocity. I'd like this organizational leverage reflected in a top-of-band offer."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $180K base in San Francisco with $130K RSU/4yr and a $30K signing bonus. Anchor with competing offers from Google ($175K base + $150K RSU), Meta ($170K base + $140K RSU), or a top fintech ($165K base + $120K RSU). If TPG opens at $148K base, counter with: "My competing offers average $285K total comp. I'm excited about TPG's Vertical AI design challenges, but I need $170K+ base and $115K+ RSUs to make the move." Walk-away floor: $162K base and $100K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $145K+ base and $85K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $160K+ base and $100K+ RSUs. Signing bonus is a separate $20K-$35K negotiation.
