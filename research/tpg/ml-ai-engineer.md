#### Negotiation DNA

The ML/AI Engineer at TPG is the technical embodiment of the firm's investment thesis. TPG has declared AI Infrastructure and Vertical AI Apps as its core meta-themes — and the ML/AI Engineer is the person who builds the AI systems that make this thesis operationally real. Since TPG's 2022 IPO, the firm has invested aggressively in assembling an AI engineering capability that can develop proprietary models, evaluate AI companies for investment, integrate AI capabilities into portfolio companies, and build AI-powered tools for TPG's own investment operations. This is not a research position. TPG expects ML/AI Engineers who can ship production ML systems that generate measurable commercial outcomes: deal scoring models that improve investment selection, natural language systems that accelerate due diligence, portfolio analytics engines that detect value creation opportunities, and AI copilot tools that multiply investment team productivity. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects the fact that ML/AI Engineers with production experience are the scarcest talent in the market, and those who also understand alternative asset management are almost non-existent. Position yourself as a revenue-generating AI builder who turns thesis into production systems, not an ML researcher who publishes papers.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. As an ML/AI Engineer, you ARE the thesis. You build the vertical AI applications. You architect the AI infrastructure. You create the Commercial Engine that differentiates TPG from every other alternative asset manager.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **You Are the Thesis Incarnate:** Every other role at TPG supports the AI thesis; you execute it directly. When TPG says "we invest in AI Infrastructure and Vertical AI Apps," they are describing your job. This thesis-centrality gives you asymmetric negotiation leverage — TPG literally cannot execute its strategy without ML/AI Engineers. Use this.
- **Vertical AI Application Development:** TPG needs ML/AI Engineers who can build domain-specific AI applications: clinical decision support systems for healthcare AI portfolio companies, credit risk models for fintech AI companies, carbon footprint prediction models for climate tech investments, and intelligent workflow automation for enterprise AI companies. If you bring vertical domain experience plus ML engineering skills, you are the unicorn candidate — price yourself accordingly.
- **Production ML Systems Scarcity:** The market distinguishes between ML researchers (plentiful) and ML engineers who can ship production systems (scarce). TPG needs the latter — engineers who can take a model from notebook to production at scale, with proper monitoring, retraining pipelines, A/B testing, and latency optimization. The +15-25% premium exists because production ML engineers are 5-10x scarcer than ML researchers.
- **AI Due Diligence Capability:** ML/AI Engineers at TPG evaluate the AI systems of potential investment targets — assessing model architecture quality, training data defensibility, inference cost structure, and scalability potential. This technical due diligence directly influences billion-dollar investment decisions. No other engineering role at TPG has this proximity to capital deployment.
- **AI Infrastructure Design Authority:** You decide whether to build or buy AI infrastructure components — embedding models, vector databases, inference serving platforms, evaluation frameworks, and orchestration layers. These build-vs-buy decisions have multi-million-dollar implications and shape TPG's AI competitive position for years.

ML/AI Engineers with production ML systems experience and any vertical AI domain expertise should push aggressively beyond posted bands. The +15-25% AI Premium is a floor, not a ceiling, for candidates who combine production ML, domain expertise, and financial services context.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Production ML Scarcity Premium**
   > "I have [X] years of experience building production ML systems — not research prototypes, but models serving [Y] million predictions daily with [Z]ms latency SLAs and automated retraining pipelines. Production ML engineers at this level are commanding $480K-$575K total comp, with the +15-25% AI Premium fully applied. I'd like the RSU component to reflect my production ML track record at $310K+ over 4 years, and the base at $280K+."

2. **Lever 2 — Vertical AI Domain Multiplier**
   > "I bring ML engineering experience in [healthcare AI / fintech AI / enterprise AI / climate tech], including [specific systems — e.g., clinical NLP, fraud detection models, revenue forecasting, carbon modeling]. This vertical domain expertise means I can build AI applications for TPG's portfolio companies from day one, without a 6-month domain learning curve. At [previous company], my vertical AI system drove $[X]M in measurable value. I'd like a vertical AI premium of 20% on top of the AI Premium, applied to the RSU grant."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Stack**
   > "I currently have offers from [OpenAI / Anthropic / Google DeepMind / Meta AI / Blackstone AI] ranging from $500K-$600K total comp. I'm drawn to TPG's unique position — building AI that evaluates AI investments — but the economics need to reflect the opportunity cost. I need $285K+ base, $330K+ RSUs over 4 years, and a $60K signing bonus to decline competing offers."

4. **Lever 4 — AI Due Diligence Value**
   > "As an ML/AI Engineer at TPG, I'll participate in technical due diligence for AI investment targets — evaluating model architectures, data moats, and scalability. This directly influences billion-dollar capital allocation decisions. At [previous company / advisory capacity], my AI evaluations informed $[X]B in investment decisions. This deal-room proximity should be reflected in premium compensation, plus co-investment rights in TPG's AI-focused funds."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $288K base in San Francisco with $335K RSU/4yr and a $60K signing bonus. Anchor with competing offers from OpenAI ($300K base + equity), Anthropic ($290K base + equity), Google DeepMind ($280K base + $380K RSU), or Blackstone AI ($265K base + carry). If TPG opens at $228K base, counter aggressively: "My competing offers average $540K total comp with the AI Premium fully applied. TPG's unique position at the intersection of AI building and AI investing is my top choice, but I need $275K+ base and $310K+ RSUs to make the economics work. I also want co-investment rights in TPG's AI-focused funds and a guaranteed annual refresh of $80K+ in RSUs." Walk-away floor: $260K base and $280K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $232K+ base and $240K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $255K+ base and $270K+ RSUs. Signing bonus is a separate $50K-$75K negotiation.
