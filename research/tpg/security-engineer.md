#### Negotiation DNA

The Security Engineer at TPG is not a traditional infosec professional running vulnerability scans and writing compliance reports. Since TPG's 2022 IPO, the firm's attack surface has expanded dramatically — public company disclosure requirements, AI model security concerns, cross-portfolio data sharing architectures, and regulatory compliance across healthcare (HIPAA), finance (SOC 2, PCI-DSS), and AI governance all create security challenges that require commercial-grade thinking. TPG manages $220B+ in assets, and a security breach does not just cause technical disruption — it causes reputational damage that erodes investor confidence and threatens capital commitments. The Security Engineer at TPG operates with a CRO/CGO mindset, understanding that security is trust infrastructure. Every security system you build protects revenue. Every compliance framework you implement enables new business opportunities (e.g., HIPAA compliance enables healthcare AI portfolio company data sharing). Position yourself as a revenue-protecting commercial leader who builds trust infrastructure, not a paranoid auditor who blocks feature deployment.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. As a Security Engineer, you are the person who ensures this AI infrastructure is trustworthy, compliant, and resilient. Without robust AI security, TPG cannot deploy AI models across regulated industries like healthcare and finance — and those regulated industries represent some of the highest-value investment opportunities.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **AI Security Is a New Discipline:** Traditional application security expertise is necessary but insufficient at TPG. The firm needs security engineers who understand AI-specific threats: model poisoning, prompt injection, training data leakage, adversarial attacks on ML models, and AI output hallucination risks. If you bring AI security expertise, you occupy a niche that the market is only beginning to price — command a premium now.
- **Regulated Industry Enablement:** TPG's healthcare AI portfolio companies require HIPAA-compliant AI systems. Fintech AI companies require PCI-DSS and SOC 2 compliant ML pipelines. A Security Engineer who can design compliance frameworks for AI systems in regulated industries does not just protect TPG — they enable TPG to make investments that competitors without this capability cannot. Security becomes a revenue enabler, not a cost center.
- **Public Company Security Obligations:** Since TPG's 2022 IPO, the firm is subject to SEC cybersecurity disclosure requirements, SOX compliance, and heightened scrutiny on data protection. The Security Engineer who manages these obligations protects TPG's market capitalization and investor confidence — measurable commercial value.
- **Cross-Portfolio Security Posture:** Security Engineers at TPG assess and improve the security posture of portfolio companies as part of value creation. A security assessment that identifies and remediates critical vulnerabilities at a portfolio company directly increases that company's enterprise value (and exit multiple). Frame this as portfolio value creation.

Security Engineers with AI security or regulated industry compliance experience should negotiate a 10-20% premium on the RSU component and request a scope-based performance bonus.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — AI Security Specialization Premium**
   > "I bring expertise in AI-specific security — including [model security / prompt injection defense / training data protection / adversarial ML / AI governance frameworks]. This is a nascent discipline with extremely scarce talent. Security engineers with production AI security experience are commanding $360K-$408K total comp at firms building AI platforms. I'd like the offer to reflect this at $225K+ base and $185K+ RSUs."

2. **Lever 2 — Regulated Industry Compliance Enablement**
   > "My experience designing security and compliance frameworks for [HIPAA / PCI-DSS / SOC 2 / GDPR] in AI systems directly enables TPG's investments in healthcare AI and fintech AI. Without this compliance capability, TPG cannot share data across portfolio companies or deploy AI in regulated environments. I'm a revenue enabler, not a cost center, and I'd like my compensation to reflect that."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Calibration**
   > "I have offers from [Google Security / AWS Security / Blackstone InfoSec / top fintech security] ranging from $320K-$405K total comp. TPG's AI security challenge is uniquely compelling — protecting AI infrastructure across multiple regulated industries — but the economics need to match the scope. I'm targeting $228K+ base and $185K+ RSUs over 4 years."

4. **Lever 4 — Public Company Trust Infrastructure**
   > "As a public company, TPG's security posture directly impacts market capitalization and investor confidence. I bring experience managing security programs for [public companies / SEC-regulated entities], including [incident response, SOX compliance, cyber risk disclosure]. This public company security expertise protects TPG's enterprise value — not just its IT systems. I'd like a top-of-band offer plus a guaranteed annual refresh of $50K-$65K in RSUs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $230K base in San Francisco with $190K RSU/4yr and a $35K signing bonus. Anchor with competing offers from Google Security ($220K base + $200K RSU), Blackstone InfoSec ($210K base + carry), or a top fintech CISO path ($225K base + $175K RSU). If TPG opens at $185K base, counter with: "My competing offers average $370K total comp, and none of them require AI security expertise at the scope TPG needs. I need $220K+ base and $175K+ RSUs to accept." Walk-away floor: $210K base and $160K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $185K+ base and $138K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $205K+ base and $155K+ RSUs. Signing bonus is a separate $28K-$45K negotiation.
