#### Negotiation DNA

The Technical Program Manager at TPG is the execution engine of the firm's AI Infrastructure and Vertical AI strategy. Since TPG's 2022 IPO, the complexity of the firm's technology portfolio has grown dramatically — cross-portfolio AI integrations, multi-team platform builds, regulatory compliance programs, and LP-facing system rollouts all require rigorous program management with deep technical fluency. This is not a traditional TPM role managing spreadsheets and status meetings. TPG's TPM operates with a CRO/CGO mindset, owning the delivery cadence of revenue-critical AI programs that span engineering, data science, investment teams, and portfolio companies. Every program milestone you hit accelerates TPG's ability to deploy capital, create portfolio value, and generate returns for investors. Every milestone you miss delays revenue. Position yourself as a commercial execution leader who ensures AI programs ship on time and on budget — not a project coordinator who tracks Gantt charts.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. As a Technical Program Manager, you ensure that this thesis translates into shipped products, integrated systems, and operational capabilities. Without effective program management, AI infrastructure projects become science experiments instead of revenue-generating platforms.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **AI Program Complexity Premium:** Managing AI programs is fundamentally different from managing traditional software programs. AI programs involve data pipeline dependencies, model training cycles, annotation workforce coordination, evaluation framework design, and regulatory compliance for AI systems. If you bring AI program management experience, you command a premium because you understand the unique failure modes and risk mitigations that AI programs require.
- **Cross-Portfolio Program Scope:** TPG's TPM manages programs that span the internal platform team and multiple portfolio companies. A single AI integration program might involve coordinating engineering teams across a healthcare AI company, a fintech AI company, and TPG's internal data science team — all while managing regulatory requirements in healthcare (HIPAA) and finance (SOC 2, PCI-DSS). This scope is far broader than a typical tech company TPM role.
- **Revenue Milestone Ownership:** At TPG, program milestones are revenue milestones. "I launched the project on time" becomes "I delivered TPG's AI-driven deal sourcing platform 6 weeks ahead of schedule, enabling the investment team to evaluate $2B in additional opportunities during Q3." Frame every milestone in revenue terms.
- **Investment Team Interface:** TPG's TPM regularly interfaces with investment professionals — MDs, Partners, and the C-suite — to align technology delivery with investment timelines. This executive interface skill is a commercial capability that typical engineering TPM roles do not require.

TPMs with AI program management experience or financial services program delivery background should negotiate a 10-15% premium on base salary, reflecting the specialized execution complexity.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — AI Program Management Premium**
   > "I've managed complex AI programs at [previous company], including [ML platform launches / LLM integration programs / AI compliance initiatives / data pipeline migrations]. AI programs have unique execution risks — data dependencies, model evaluation cycles, annotation quality management — and I have a proven track record of navigating these risks. AI-experienced TPMs are commanding $340K-$392K total comp. I'd like the base to reflect this at $215K+."

2. **Lever 2 — Revenue Milestone Track Record**
   > "At [previous company], I managed programs that directly drove $[X]M in revenue by delivering [platform / feature / integration] ahead of schedule. At TPG, every program milestone I hit accelerates the firm's ability to deploy capital and create portfolio value. I'm a revenue accelerator, and I'd like my compensation to reflect this at $210K+ base and $175K+ RSUs."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Anchoring**
   > "I'm evaluating offers from [Google TPM / Meta TPM / Blackstone Program / McKinsey Implementation] ranging from $310K-$390K total comp. TPG's cross-portfolio AI program scope is uniquely compelling, but the economics need to match. I'm targeting $215K+ base and $175K+ RSUs over 4 years."

4. **Lever 4 — Executive Interface Premium**
   > "This role requires regular interface with TPG's investment leadership — Partners, MDs, and portfolio company C-suite. I bring [X] years of experience managing executive-level stakeholders in [financial services / consulting / enterprise tech], including [specific programs with C-suite visibility]. This executive communication skill is rare among TPMs and should be reflected in a top-of-band offer, plus a guaranteed annual refresh of $45K-$60K in RSUs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $218K base in San Francisco with $180K RSU/4yr and a $35K signing bonus. Anchor with competing offers from Google TPM ($210K base + $200K RSU), Blackstone Program ($195K base + carry), or McKinsey Implementation ($205K base + performance bonus). If TPG opens at $178K base, counter with: "My competing offers average $355K total comp. I'm drawn to TPG's AI program complexity, but I need $208K+ base and $165K+ RSUs to accept." Walk-away floor: $198K base and $150K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $175K+ base and $128K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $195K+ base and $148K+ RSUs. Signing bonus is a separate $28K-$45K negotiation.
