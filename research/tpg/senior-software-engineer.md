#### Negotiation DNA

The Senior Software Engineer at TPG occupies a critical inflection point in the firm's Commercial Engine strategy. Since going public in 2022, TPG has aggressively invested in AI Infrastructure and Vertical AI Apps as its defining meta-themes — and senior engineers are the ones translating that thesis into production systems. At this level, you are not simply writing code. You are architecting the platforms that power AI-driven deal sourcing, portfolio company performance analytics, LP reporting automation, and cross-portfolio AI integration. TPG's $220B+ AUM generates enormous data gravity, and the senior engineer is expected to harness it for commercial advantage. You own technical decisions that directly impact revenue velocity across TPG's healthcare AI, fintech AI, climate tech, and enterprise AI investments. Frame yourself as a Commercial Engine architect — someone who designs systems that make money, not someone who closes Jira tickets.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. As a Senior Software Engineer, you sit at the exact nexus where this thesis becomes reality. You are not supporting investment teams — you are building the AI-powered Commercial Engine that defines TPG's competitive advantage in the market.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **System Ownership = Revenue Ownership:** At the senior level, you own entire systems. If your system powers deal-flow analytics, you directly influence how quickly TPG identifies and closes investments. If your system powers portfolio company AI integration, you directly influence the value creation that drives fund returns. This is not support work — this is revenue infrastructure.
- **Vertical AI Domain Expertise:** TPG's portfolio spans healthcare AI (clinical decision support, claims automation), fintech AI (credit scoring, fraud detection), climate tech (carbon accounting, energy optimization), and enterprise AI (workflow automation, document intelligence). Senior engineers who bring domain expertise in any of these verticals command a 15-20% premium because they can accelerate portfolio company integrations.
- **AI Infrastructure Architecture:** If you have experience designing and operating ML platforms, LLM orchestration systems, data pipelines at scale, or real-time inference architectures, you are building the foundation that every Vertical AI application sits on. This architectural competency is the scarcest skill in alternative asset management technology.
- **Commercial Framing Is Non-Negotiable:** At this level, TPG evaluates candidates on their ability to articulate commercial impact. "I architected a microservices migration" becomes "I architected a platform migration that reduced time-to-insight for portfolio analytics from 48 hours to 15 minutes, enabling the deal team to act on market dislocations 3x faster."

Senior engineers with Vertical AI experience should target the top 25% of the band and negotiate for accelerated RSU vesting or a Year-1 RSU front-load to capture near-term upside in TPG's public equity.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — AI Platform Architecture Premium**
   > "I've designed and shipped production AI platforms that serve [X] million requests per day at [previous company]. TPG's AI Infrastructure thesis requires senior engineers who can build these systems from the ground up — not manage vendor integrations. My architecture experience across [LLM orchestration / ML pipelines / real-time inference / vector search] is directly applicable to the portfolio analytics and AI integration platforms TPG is building. I'd like the RSU grant to reflect this — $280K+ over 4 years, consistent with what competing firms are offering for this skillset."

2. **Lever 2 — Portfolio Company Integration Value**
   > "What excites me about TPG is the opportunity to build AI systems that create value across the entire portfolio — not just internal tools. I bring domain expertise in [healthcare AI / fintech AI / enterprise AI], and I can accelerate the integration of AI capabilities into portfolio companies from day one. At [previous company], I led a similar initiative that drove $[X]M in measurable value creation. This cross-portfolio impact should be reflected in a top-of-band offer."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Anchoring**
   > "I currently have offers from [Blackstone / KKR / Vista Equity / top-tier tech company] at $[X]K total comp. I'm drawn to TPG's Vertical AI thesis because it aligns with my career trajectory — but the economics need to be competitive. Specifically, I'd like to see the base at $240K+ and the RSU grant at $300K+ over 4 years to match the competing package."

4. **Lever 4 — Public Equity Alignment & Refresh Mechanism**
   > "Since TPG is publicly traded, I want to ensure my equity compensation has a built-in refresh mechanism. I'm proposing an annual refresh grant of $75K-$100K in RSUs, plus a performance-based accelerator tied to specific engineering milestones — for example, launching the AI portfolio analytics platform. This aligns my compensation with TPG's shareholder value creation and ensures retention beyond Year 1."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $245K base in San Francisco with $300K RSU/4yr and a $50K signing bonus. Anchor with competing offers from Blackstone ($235K base + carry participation), KKR ($240K base + co-invest), or Vista Equity ($250K base + profit sharing). If TPG opens at $195K base, counter with: "I have a competing offer at $240K base with $280K equity. TPG's Vertical AI thesis is my top choice, but I need to see $235K+ base and $280K+ RSUs to move forward." Walk-away floor: $225K base and $250K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $200K+ base and $220K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $220K+ base and $260K+ RSUs. Negotiate the signing bonus as a separate line item — $40K-$60K is standard for senior hires at TPG's peer firms.
