#### Negotiation DNA

The Solutions Architect at TPG bridges the gap between the firm's AI Infrastructure vision and its operational reality across portfolio companies. Since TPG's 2022 IPO and commitment to Vertical AI Apps as a core investment meta-theme, the Solutions Architect has become one of the most commercially impactful roles in TPG's technology organization. You are not designing systems in isolation — you are working directly with portfolio company CTOs, investment deal teams, and internal platform engineers to architect AI-powered solutions that create measurable enterprise value. At a firm managing $220B+ in assets across healthcare AI, fintech AI, climate tech, and enterprise AI, the Solutions Architect is the technical translation layer between TPG's investment thesis and its portfolio companies' technology needs. This is a client-facing, revenue-driving role with a CRO/CGO orientation. Position yourself as a commercial technical leader who architects revenue, not a back-office engineer who draws system diagrams.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. As a Solutions Architect, you are the person who connects this thesis to individual portfolio companies — designing the AI architectures that transform TPG's investments from traditional businesses into AI-powered enterprises.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **Portfolio Company Value Creation:** When TPG acquires a healthcare company, the Solutions Architect designs the AI integration architecture that transforms it into a healthcare AI company. When TPG invests in a fintech startup, the Solutions Architect evaluates and extends the AI infrastructure. Your architecture decisions directly increase (or decrease) the enterprise value of billion-dollar investments. This is not internal tooling — this is value creation architecture.
- **Technical Due Diligence Revenue:** Solutions Architects at TPG participate in technical due diligence for potential acquisitions. Your assessment of an AI company's architecture, data moat, model quality, and scalability directly influences whether TPG writes a check. If you bring experience in AI system evaluation, you are contributing to deal quality — the highest-leverage activity at the firm.
- **Cross-Vertical Architecture Fluency:** TPG needs Solutions Architects who can work across healthcare AI (HL7/FHIR integration, HIPAA-compliant ML), fintech AI (real-time transaction processing, regulatory compliance), climate tech (sensor data architectures, carbon accounting systems), and enterprise AI (multi-tenant SaaS, API platform design). This cross-vertical fluency is rare and commands a premium.
- **Client-Facing Commercial Skills:** Unlike a traditional architect who works with internal engineering teams, TPG's Solutions Architect works with portfolio company leadership — CEOs, CTOs, VPs of Engineering. Your ability to communicate complex technical architectures to business stakeholders and translate their needs into implementable designs is a commercial skill, not a technical skill.

Solutions Architects with cross-vertical AI architecture experience and client-facing consulting skills should push for top-of-band compensation and negotiate a portfolio impact bonus tied to value creation milestones.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Portfolio Value Creation Premium**
   > "As a Solutions Architect at TPG, my architecture decisions directly impact the enterprise value of portfolio companies worth billions. At [previous consulting firm / previous role], I designed AI architectures for [X] companies that drove $[Y]M in measurable value creation. This is not internal tool architecture — this is Commercial Engine architecture, and I'd like the compensation to reflect that at $225K+ base and $200K+ RSUs."

2. **Lever 2 — Technical Due Diligence Capability**
   > "I bring experience evaluating AI systems for [acquisition / investment] purposes — assessing model architectures, data pipelines, inference scalability, and technical debt. At [previous company], my due diligence assessments directly influenced $[X]B in investment decisions. This capability puts me in the deal room, not the server room. I'd like a top-of-band offer that reflects this deal-team adjacency."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Calibration**
   > "I have offers from [AWS SA / Google Cloud SA / Blackstone Tech Advisor / McKinsey Digital] ranging from $340K-$425K total comp. TPG's cross-portfolio AI architecture challenge is uniquely compelling, but the economics need to be competitive. I'm targeting $225K+ base and $200K+ RSUs over 4 years."

4. **Lever 4 — Cross-Vertical Architecture Fluency**
   > "I have architecture experience across [healthcare / fintech / enterprise SaaS / climate tech], including [specific technical domains — e.g., HIPAA-compliant ML systems, real-time fraud detection, multi-tenant AI platforms]. At TPG, this cross-vertical fluency means I can add value to every portfolio company from day one, not just one vertical. I'd like this breadth premium reflected in the RSU grant: $210K+ over 4 years."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $228K base in San Francisco with $210K RSU/4yr and a $40K signing bonus. Anchor with competing offers from AWS SA ($215K base + $180K RSU), McKinsey Digital ($220K base + performance bonus), or Blackstone Tech Advisor ($205K base + carry). If TPG opens at $185K base, counter with: "My competing offers average $385K total comp. I'm choosing TPG for the portfolio-wide AI architecture scope, but I need $218K+ base and $195K+ RSUs to make the move. I'd also want a portfolio impact bonus tied to value creation metrics." Walk-away floor: $205K base and $175K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $182K+ base and $148K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $200K+ base and $170K+ RSUs. Signing bonus is a separate $30K-$50K negotiation.
