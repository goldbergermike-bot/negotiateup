#### Negotiation DNA

The Staff Software Engineer at TPG is the firm's most senior individual contributor in technology — a role that carries outsized influence on TPG's AI Infrastructure and Vertical AI investment thesis. Since TPG's 2022 IPO, the firm has repositioned its technology organization from a support function to a Commercial Engine that drives deal origination, portfolio value creation, and LP reporting at scale. The Staff Engineer is the architect of this transformation. You are not writing code for internal dashboards — you are designing the technical architecture that powers a $220B+ AUM platform, defining AI integration strategies that apply across TPG's entire portfolio of healthcare AI, fintech AI, climate tech, and enterprise AI companies, and making build-vs-buy decisions that directly impact the firm's operating leverage. This is a CRO/CGO-adjacent technical leadership role. TPG expects Staff Engineers to think like commercial leaders who happen to have deep technical expertise. The +15-25% premium reflects the scarcity of engineers who combine principal-level architecture skills with commercial instinct and alternative asset management context.

#### Vertical AI — The Commercial Engine Premium

TPG's thesis is that vertical AI applications built on top of AI infrastructure will create the next wave of enterprise value. At the Staff Engineer level, you are not just executing on this thesis — you are defining it. You architect the platforms that make TPG's Vertical AI strategy operationally real.

**Why this matters for your negotiation:**

- **Thesis-Level Influence:** Staff Engineers at TPG have a seat at the table when investment teams evaluate AI companies. Your technical due diligence directly informs billion-dollar allocation decisions. When you assess an AI healthcare company's ML architecture, your opinion influences whether TPG writes a $500M check. This influence is worth a premium over pure-play tech company Staff Engineer roles, where your impact is limited to product features.
- **Cross-Portfolio AI Architecture:** TPG's portfolio includes dozens of companies across healthcare AI, fintech AI, climate tech, and enterprise AI. The Staff Engineer designs the integration architecture that allows AI capabilities to be shared, standardized, and scaled across these companies. This is a unique role — no FAANG company offers this breadth of AI domain exposure. Price accordingly.
- **Commercial Engine Leadership:** At Staff level, TPG expects you to frame technical decisions in commercial terms. "I designed a data lake" becomes "I architected a cross-portfolio data platform that reduced due diligence cycle time by 60%, enabling TPG to close 4 additional deals per quarter worth $2B in aggregate." If you can demonstrate this commercial framing, you command top-of-band.
- **AI Infrastructure Scarcity Premium (+15-25%):** The +15-25% premium exists because Staff Engineers with AI Infrastructure expertise and financial services context are extraordinarily scarce. There are perhaps 200-300 engineers in the US who can architect production ML systems at scale AND understand alternative asset management workflows. If you are one of them, your negotiation leverage is asymmetric.

Staff Engineers with both AI Infrastructure architecture experience and Vertical AI domain expertise should push beyond the posted band ceiling by negotiating a custom equity package with front-loaded RSU vesting and a guaranteed Year-2 refresh.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Architectural Scarcity Premium**
   > "There are very few engineers who can architect AI Infrastructure platforms at the scale TPG requires while also understanding the commercial dynamics of alternative asset management. At [previous company], I designed systems that processed $[X]B in transaction data and served [Y] million inference requests daily. This combination of scale, AI depth, and financial services context is what TPG needs — and the market prices it at $650K-$750K total comp. I'd like the RSU grant to reflect this scarcity: $450K+ over 4 years with a 40% Year-1 front-load."

2. **Lever 2 — Cross-Portfolio Value Creation**
   > "What makes TPG's Staff Engineer role unique is the cross-portfolio impact. I won't be building features for one product — I'll be designing AI architecture that creates value across every company in TPG's portfolio. At [previous company], I led a similar cross-business-unit AI platform initiative that generated $[X]M in incremental revenue. I want my compensation to reflect this multiplied impact — specifically, a base of $310K+ and an RSU package that vests on an accelerated schedule."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Stack**
   > "I'm currently evaluating offers from [Google Staff / Meta E6 / Blackstone VP Tech / KKR Principal Technologist] ranging from $680K-$780K total comp. TPG's Vertical AI thesis is the most compelling opportunity on my list, but the economics need to be competitive. I'd need $300K+ base, $480K+ RSUs over 4 years, and a $75K signing bonus to decline the competing offers."

4. **Lever 4 — Equity Structure & Retention**
   > "Given TPG's public equity structure, I'd like to propose a retention-optimized equity package: $500K RSUs over 4 years with a front-loaded vesting schedule (40/25/20/15), plus an annual refresh commitment of $120K-$150K in new RSU grants contingent on performance. Additionally, I'd like to discuss co-investment rights in TPG's funds as a supplement to the RSU package — this is standard at Blackstone and KKR for technology leadership."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $315K base in San Francisco with $480K RSU/4yr (front-loaded 40/25/20/15), a $75K signing bonus, and a guaranteed Year-2 refresh of $120K+ in new RSUs. Anchor with competing offers from Google Staff ($340K base + $500K RSU), Meta E6 ($330K base + $480K RSU), or Blackstone VP Tech ($290K base + carry). If TPG opens at $255K base, counter aggressively: "My competing offers average $720K total comp. I'm choosing TPG for the Vertical AI thesis alignment, but I need $305K+ base and $450K+ RSUs to make the economics work. I'll also need co-investment rights in TPG's funds." Walk-away floor: $290K base and $400K RSUs in San Francisco. In Fort Worth, accept at $260K+ base and $350K+ RSUs. In New York, accept at $285K+ base and $380K+ RSUs. The signing bonus should be negotiated as a separate $60K-$100K line item.
