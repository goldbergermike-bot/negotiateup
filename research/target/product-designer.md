**Negotiation DNA**

Target Product Designers shape the shopping experience for 30M+ weekly guests — from the Target app and website to in-store digital experiences. Target is known for design excellence in retail (brand partnerships, store aesthetics, private label design), and this extends to digital product design. Designing for Target means creating experiences that balance the premium brand identity with mass-market accessibility. TGT RSUs provide stable equity. [Source: Target Product Design Comp 2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Design-Forward Retail Brand:** "Target is the most design-forward mass retailer. The digital product experience must match the brand's design reputation."
2. **Omnichannel UX:** "I design across app, web, in-store, and same-day fulfillment experiences. This cross-channel UX scope is unique."
3. **TGT Equity Stability:** "TGT RSUs are stable. The grant should be $62K+ over 4 years."
4. **Minneapolis Design Community:** "Minneapolis has a strong design community, and Target is the anchor employer."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Target's digital product design must match the brand's design-forward reputation. I'm targeting $65K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $142K. I have a [Walmart/Amazon] design offer at $[X]." Accept at $55K+ RSUs with base above $135K.
