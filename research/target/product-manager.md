Target Product Managers define the product strategy for retail technology serving 30M+ weekly guests — e-commerce, same-day fulfillment (Drive Up, Order Pickup), supply chain, and store technology. PMs at Target have meaningful impact during a period of significant tech investment. Target's same-day fulfillment services are industry-leading, and PMs shape the product strategy that maintains this competitive advantage. TGT RSUs provide stable equity.
