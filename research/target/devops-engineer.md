**Negotiation DNA**

Target DevOps Engineers build and maintain the infrastructure supporting retail operations — e-commerce platforms, store systems, supply chain technology, and same-day fulfillment. Target's infrastructure must handle peak retail events (Black Friday, back-to-school, holiday) without failure. The company has invested in modern cloud infrastructure and CI/CD practices. TGT RSUs provide stable equity. [Source: Target DevOps Comp 2026]
