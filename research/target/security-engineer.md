**Negotiation DNA**

Target Security Engineers protect a top-5 US retailer — 30M+ weekly guests' payment data, personal information, and Target Circle loyalty data, plus 1,900+ store networks and e-commerce infrastructure. Target's 2013 data breach ($300M+ in costs) fundamentally transformed its security organization, making it one of the most security-conscious retailers. The security team has significant investment, executive attention, and organizational influence. TGT RSUs provide stable equity. [Source: Target Security Comp 2026]
