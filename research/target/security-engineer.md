### Security Engineer | Target Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growing Tech Investment | TGT RSUs (Stable Retail) | Mid-Tier Comp | Minneapolis Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Minneapolis (HQ) | $115K-$165K | $30K-$100K | 10% | $140K-$220K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Target Security Engineers protect a top-5 US retailer — 30M+ weekly guests' payment data, personal information, and Target Circle loyalty data, plus 1,900+ store networks and e-commerce infrastructure. Target's 2013 data breach ($300M+ in costs) fundamentally transformed its security organization, making it one of the most security-conscious retailers. The security team has significant investment, executive attention, and organizational influence. TGT RSUs provide stable equity. [Source: Target Security Comp 2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Post-Breach Security Leadership:** "Target's security org was rebuilt after the 2013 breach, making it one of the most invested and influential security teams in retail. I'm joining a mature, well-resourced security organization."
2. **Retail Payment Security:** "I protect payment data for 30M+ weekly guests. Retail payment security is critical and well-funded at Target."
3. **TGT Equity Stability:** "TGT RSUs are stable. The grant should be $85K+ over 4 years."
4. **Minneapolis Security Community:** "Minneapolis has a growing cybersecurity community, anchored by Target and other major employers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Target's security team is one of the most well-invested in retail. I'm targeting $88K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $162K. I have a [Walmart/Amazon] security offer at $[X]." Accept at $72K+ RSUs with base above $152K.
