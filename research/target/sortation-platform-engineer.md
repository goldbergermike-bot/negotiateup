### Sortation Platform Engineer | Target Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growing Tech Investment | TGT RSUs (Stable Retail) | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+5-10% SUPPLY CHAIN PREMIUM** | Minneapolis Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Minneapolis (HQ) | $130K-$182K | $45K-$130K | 10% | $160K-$258K |
| Bay Area / India | $140K-$195K | $55K-$145K | 10% | $175K-$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Target's signature engineering role. Sortation Platform Engineers build the software that powers Target's supply chain sortation centers — the facilities that sort, route, and distribute millions of packages and store replenishment orders to 1,900+ Target stores and directly to customers' homes. Target's sortation platform is the backbone of its same-day delivery, Drive Up, and Order Pickup services — the fulfillment capabilities that differentiate Target from pure e-commerce competitors. The 5-10% supply chain premium reflects the specialized expertise in warehouse automation, robotics integration, and logistics optimization. Target has invested heavily in its supply chain technology, building sortation centers across the US to enable faster, cheaper fulfillment. TGT RSUs provide stable retail equity ($65B market cap, consistent dividend). Minneapolis offers a strong quality of life with significantly lower cost of living than coastal cities.
