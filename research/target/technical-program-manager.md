**Negotiation DNA**

Target Technical Program Managers coordinate complex programs across retail technology — e-commerce platform evolution, supply chain modernization, same-day fulfillment rollouts, and store technology upgrades. TPMs at Target manage programs that span 1,900+ stores, multiple fulfillment channels, and a growing vendor/partner ecosystem. The coordination required for retail-scale technology rollouts is demanding — every change affects in-store operations, e-commerce, and fulfillment simultaneously. TGT RSUs provide stable equity.
