### Staff Software Engineer | Target Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growing Tech Investment | TGT RSUs (Stable Retail) | Mid-Tier Comp | Minneapolis Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Minneapolis (HQ) | $158K-$205K | $65K-$175K | 10% | $202K-$315K |
| Bay Area / India | $170K-$220K | $78K-$195K | 10% | $222K-$345K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Target define the technical strategy for major platforms — e-commerce, supply chain, fulfillment, store technology, or data platform. At Staff level, Target's comp becomes significantly more competitive as the company invests in retaining technical leaders who can drive its technology transformation. You influence multiple teams and set architectural direction for systems serving 30M+ weekly guests. The Minneapolis cost-of-living advantage makes Staff-level Target comp particularly attractive on a purchasing power basis. [Source: Target Staff SWE Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Target Staff SWE = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Amazon Principal SDE = Walmart Global Tech Staff SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Technology Transformation Leadership:** "At Staff level, I'm driving Target's technology transformation — defining the architecture that modernizes retail at scale."
2. **TGT Equity at Staff Level:** "TGT RSUs at Staff level should be $155K+ over 4 years, reflecting the technical leadership impact."
3. **Minneapolis Wealth Building:** "Staff-level comp in Minneapolis ($290K+) enables wealth building that $450K+ in the Bay Area cannot match."
4. **FAANG Alternative:** "My alternative is a Google L5 or Amazon Principal at $[X]. Target's scale is comparable, and the Minneapolis lifestyle is superior."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "At Staff level, I'll define Target's technical direction during a critical transformation period. I'm targeting $160K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $200K. I have a Google L5 offer at $[X]." Accept at $135K+ RSUs with base above $190K.
