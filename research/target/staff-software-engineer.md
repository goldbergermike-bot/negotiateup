**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Target define the technical strategy for major platforms — e-commerce, supply chain, fulfillment, store technology, or data platform. At Staff level, Target's comp becomes significantly more competitive as the company invests in retaining technical leaders who can drive its technology transformation. You influence multiple teams and set architectural direction for systems serving 30M+ weekly guests. The Minneapolis cost-of-living advantage makes Staff-level Target comp particularly attractive on a purchasing power basis. [Source: Target Staff SWE Comp 2026]
