### Software Engineer | Target Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growing Tech Investment | TGT RSUs (Stable Retail) | Mid-Tier Comp | Minneapolis Advantage

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Minneapolis (HQ) | $115K-$165K | $30K-$100K | 10% | $140K-$220K |
| Bay Area / India | $125K-$178K | $38K-$115K | 10% | $153K-$240K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Target Software Engineers build systems for a retailer that serves 30M+ weekly guests across 1,900+ stores and a growing digital platform. Target has invested heavily in technology — building internal teams for e-commerce, supply chain, same-day fulfillment (Drive Up, Order Pickup), and store technology. Compensation is mid-tier compared to FAANG but includes stable TGT RSUs ($65B market cap, consistent dividend), a 10% bonus, and the Minneapolis cost-of-living advantage. Target's tech culture has improved significantly — the company has moved from outsourced development to a modern, product-driven engineering organization. [Source: Target SWE Comp 2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Growing Tech Investment:** "Target is investing heavily in technology and building out its engineering org. Joining now means growing with a company that's prioritizing tech transformation."
2. **TGT Equity Stability:** "TGT RSUs are stable with consistent dividends. The grant should be sized at $85K+ over 4 years."
3. **Same-Day Fulfillment Tech:** "Target's same-day services (Drive Up, Order Pickup) are industry-leading. I'm building the technology behind these differentiating capabilities."
4. **Minneapolis Lifestyle:** "Minneapolis offers exceptional quality of life — strong schools, outdoor recreation, culture — at 40-50% lower cost than coastal cities."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "Target's tech investment and same-day fulfillment innovation are compelling. I'm targeting $90K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $162K. I have a [Walmart/Amazon] offer at $[X]. The Minneapolis lifestyle and TGT stability are attractive." Accept if RSUs exceed $75K/4yr with a sign-on bonus.
