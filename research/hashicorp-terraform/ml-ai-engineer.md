### ML/AI Engineer | HashiCorp (Terraform) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Remote-First Equity-Heavy | Infrastructure-as-Code Market Leader | IBM Acquisition Premium (2024) | **+15-25% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K–$240K | $170K–$300K | 5–10% | $252K–$365K |
| Austin / Denver | $175K–$228K | $155K–$278K | 5–10% | $238K–$345K |
| London | £140K–£183K | £130K–£228K | 5–10% | £192K–£278K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at HashiCorp are building the intelligence layer for infrastructure automation — AI-assisted Terraform configuration generation, intelligent drift detection, predictive resource optimization, and natural language infrastructure provisioning. This is a relatively new function at HashiCorp, accelerated by the IBM acquisition and access to watsonx AI capabilities. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects the fact that ML engineers who understand infrastructure-as-code semantics and can build production AI features for developer tools are in extraordinary demand across the industry. HashiCorp's unique advantage: you're building AI on top of the world's largest corpus of infrastructure configuration data.

**Level Mapping:** HashiCorp ML/AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta E4-E5 ML Engineer = IBM Band 8-9 AI Engineer = AWS Applied Scientist

### 🏗️ AI-Powered Infrastructure Automation Lever
In 2026, HashiCorp is investing aggressively in AI-powered infrastructure features: natural language to Terraform configuration, AI-assisted security policy generation for Vault, intelligent infrastructure recommendations in HCP, and LLM-powered troubleshooting. ML/AI Engineers building these capabilities are creating the next generation of infrastructure tooling. Use this: "AI-powered infrastructure automation is HashiCorp's biggest product differentiator for 2026. Engineers who can build production ML systems on infrastructure data — Terraform configurations, cloud state, deployment patterns — are creating entirely new product categories. My experience with [LLMs / code generation / infrastructure ML] directly accelerates this roadmap."

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Premium for Infrastructure ML:** "The +15-25% AI Premium applies because ML engineers who understand infrastructure semantics, HCL syntax, and cloud provider APIs are exceptionally rare. I'd like $235K base to reflect this premium over standard SWE compensation."
2. **IBM watsonx Synergy:** "Integrating HashiCorp's infrastructure AI with IBM's watsonx platform creates a differentiated enterprise offering that neither company could build alone. My experience with [enterprise AI / LLM deployment / foundation models] accelerates this integration — $290K RSU/4yr."
3. **Infrastructure Data Moat:** "HashiCorp has the world's largest corpus of infrastructure configuration data — billions of Terraform runs. Building AI on this moat is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. I'd like equity that reflects the long-term value I'm creating: $295K RSU/4yr with annual refreshers."
4. **Competing AI Infrastructure Offers:** "I'm holding an AWS AI offer at $220K base / $280K RSU for infrastructure ML and a Pulumi offer at $210K base / $250K RSU. I need $235K base and $295K RSU/4yr to choose HashiCorp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build AI-powered infrastructure automation at HashiCorp — natural language Terraform generation, intelligent drift detection, and predictive resource optimization on the world's largest infrastructure data corpus. I'm holding an AWS offer at $220K base / $280K RSU/4yr and a Pulumi offer at $210K base / $250K RSU. HashiCorp's infrastructure data moat and the watsonx integration opportunity are uniquely compelling. I need $235K base, $295K RSU/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. The AI Premium applies — ML engineers who can build production AI on infrastructure data are in single-digit supply. At $235K, I'm committed. My floor is $210K — below that, the AWS AI lab resources and liquid equity win."
