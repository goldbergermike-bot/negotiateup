### Security Engineer | HashiCorp (Terraform) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Remote-First Equity-Heavy | Infrastructure-as-Code Market Leader | IBM Acquisition Premium (2024)

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $175K–$225K | $145K–$260K | 5–10% | $235K–$325K |
| Austin / Denver | $165K–$215K | $132K–$240K | 5–10% | $220K–$305K |
| London | £133K–£171K | £110K–£198K | 5–10% | £178K–£247K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at HashiCorp occupy a unique position in the security industry: you're building and securing the tools that protect infrastructure across millions of organizations. Vault alone is the industry-standard secrets management platform, and Terraform's security posture directly impacts the cloud infrastructure of enterprises worldwide. Post-IBM acquisition, security requirements have expanded to include IBM's enterprise compliance frameworks (FedRAMP, SOC2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA), making security engineers who understand both HashiCorp's open-source security model and IBM's enterprise compliance requirements extremely valuable. In 2026, security-focused infrastructure roles command a significant premium.

### 🏗️ Vault & Enterprise Compliance Lever
HashiCorp Vault is the company's most security-critical product and highest-revenue enterprise offering. Security Engineers who work on Vault's cryptographic systems, secrets engines, and enterprise compliance capabilities are directly protecting HashiCorp's most valuable asset. In 2026, IBM's enterprise customers demand FedRAMP High, DISA IL5, and government compliance certifications — creating massive demand for security engineers who can harden Vault and HCP for these regulated environments. Use this: "Vault is HashiCorp's crown jewel — the product that enterprise customers trust with their most sensitive secrets and cryptographic keys. Security Engineers who can harden Vault for FedRAMP, government, and regulated-industry requirements are directly enabling HashiCorp's highest-value enterprise deals."

**Global Levers**
1. **Vault Security Expertise Premium:** "Vault's cryptographic systems, secrets engines, and enterprise security architecture are among the most sensitive codebases in the infrastructure industry. I'd like $220K base to reflect the specialized security expertise required for this critical product."
2. **Enterprise Compliance Acceleration:** "IBM's enterprise customers need FedRAMP High, HIPAA, and government compliance certifications for HCP. My experience with [FedRAMP / compliance automation / government security] directly accelerates these certifications — $255K RSU/4yr."
3. **Security Product + Security Operations Dual Role:** "At HashiCorp, I'm simultaneously a product security engineer (securing Vault, Terraform) and an operational security engineer (securing HCP infrastructure). That dual mandate justifies $220K base and a $30K signing bonus."
4. **Competing Security Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike offer at $210K base / $240K RSU and a Palo Alto Networks offer at $205K base / $230K RSU. I need $220K base and $255K RSU/4yr to choose HashiCorp's security-critical role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to secure the infrastructure tools that millions of organizations depend on — hardening Vault, Terraform, and HCP for the most demanding enterprise and government environments. I'm holding security offers from CrowdStrike at $210K base / $240K RSU/4yr and Palo Alto at $205K base / $230K RSU. HashiCorp's security challenges are uniquely impactful, but I need $220K base, $255K RSU/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $220K, I commit to making HashiCorp the most trusted security infrastructure in the industry. My floor is $200K — below that, the CrowdStrike equity and security focus win."
