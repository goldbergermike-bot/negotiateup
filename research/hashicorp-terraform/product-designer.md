### Product Designer | HashiCorp (Terraform) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Remote-First Equity-Heavy | Infrastructure-as-Code Market Leader | IBM Acquisition Premium (2024)

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $150K–$195K | $100K–$180K | 5–10% | $185K–$258K |
| Austin / Denver | $140K–$185K | $90K–$165K | 5–10% | $173K–$243K |
| London | £115K–£148K | £76K–£137K | 5–10% | £140K–£196K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at HashiCorp create the user experience for some of the most complex developer tools in the world — making Terraform, Vault, Consul, and HCP intuitive for infrastructure engineers who manage millions of cloud resources daily. This is infrastructure UX at its hardest: you're designing interfaces for declarative configuration languages, state management visualizations, cloud resource graphs, and enterprise security policy workflows. Post-IBM acquisition, the design mandate has expanded to include enterprise UX patterns, IBM Design Language integration, and the challenge of making HCP compelling to both individual developers and enterprise procurement teams. Designers who understand developer tooling UX and enterprise design systems are rare.

### 🏗️ HCP Enterprise UX & Developer Experience Lever
In 2026, HashiCorp is investing in a unified HCP experience that serves both individual developers and enterprise teams — a design challenge that requires balancing developer simplicity with enterprise complexity. Product Designers who can create experiences that convert open-source Terraform users into HCP customers are directly driving revenue. Use this: "HCP's product-led growth depends on design that converts free Terraform users into paying HCP customers. Designers who understand developer workflows, infrastructure visualization, and enterprise UX patterns are directly driving HashiCorp's ARR growth. My portfolio of [developer tool design / data visualization / enterprise SaaS UX] demonstrates this exact capability."

**Global Levers**
1. **Developer Tooling UX Specialization:** "Designing for infrastructure engineers — Terraform configuration UX, state visualization, cloud resource graphs — is a specialized design discipline. I'd like $190K base to reflect this niche expertise that most product designers don't possess."
2. **IBM Design Language Integration:** "Harmonizing HashiCorp's design system with IBM's Carbon Design System while preserving the developer-first UX is a multi-year initiative. My experience with [design systems / enterprise UX / developer tools] accelerates this — $175K RSU/4yr."
3. **PLG Conversion Design Impact:** "Every HCP design decision I make directly impacts the open-source-to-enterprise conversion funnel. I'd like equity that reflects this revenue impact: $178K RSU/4yr with performance-based refreshers tied to conversion metrics."
4. **Competing Design Offers:** "I'm holding a Figma offer at $185K base / $190K RSU for developer tool design and an Atlassian offer at $175K base / $170K RSU. I need $190K base and $178K RSU/4yr to choose HashiCorp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to design the future of infrastructure automation UX — making Terraform and HCP intuitive for millions of developers while meeting enterprise requirements. I'm holding a Figma offer at $185K base / $190K RSU/4yr. HashiCorp's design challenges are uniquely compelling, but I need $190K base, $178K RSU/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $190K, I'm committed to making HCP the best-designed infrastructure platform in the industry. My floor is $172K — below that, Figma's design culture and equity win."
