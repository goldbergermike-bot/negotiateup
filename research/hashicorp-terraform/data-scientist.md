**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at HashiCorp drive product analytics, growth modeling, and infrastructure intelligence across the Terraform ecosystem and HCP platform. Post-IBM acquisition, the data science mandate has expanded to include predictive infrastructure modeling — using ML to forecast cloud resource consumption, optimize Terraform plan execution, and identify enterprise upsell opportunities within HCP's usage data. HashiCorp Data Scientists sit at the intersection of infrastructure domain expertise and statistical rigor, making this a uniquely technical DS role compared to typical product analytics positions. The IBM integration has also opened up opportunities to leverage watsonx AI capabilities for infrastructure intelligence features.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Intelligence & Predictive Analytics Lever
In 2026, HashiCorp is investing heavily in predictive infrastructure analytics — using ML models to forecast cloud costs, predict drift, optimize resource allocation, and surface intelligent recommendations to Terraform users. Data Scientists building these models are creating a new category of infrastructure intelligence that differentiates HCP from competitors. Use this: "Infrastructure intelligence is HashiCorp's next product frontier — predictive cost modeling, drift detection, and intelligent resource recommendations. Data Scientists who can build production ML models on infrastructure telemetry data are creating entirely new revenue streams for HCP."

**Global Levers**
1. **Infrastructure ML Specialization:** "Building ML models on infrastructure telemetry — Terraform state data, cloud provider metrics, deployment patterns — requires rare domain expertise. I'd like $205K base to reflect this specialization that's more technically demanding than standard product analytics."
2. **IBM watsonx Integration Opportunity:** "Integrating HashiCorp's infrastructure intelligence with IBM's watsonx AI platform creates a differentiated enterprise offering. My experience with [ML infrastructure / production model deployment / enterprise AI] directly accelerates this, justifying $215K RSU/4yr."
3. **Product-Led Growth Analytics:** "HCP's open-source-to-enterprise conversion funnel is the core growth engine. I'll be building the analytics and ML models that optimize this funnel — directly impacting ARR. That P&L proximity justifies $205K base and a $20K signing bonus."
4. **Competing DS Offers:** "I'm comparing this with a Datadog offer at $195K base / $210K RSU for infrastructure analytics and a Databricks offer at $200K base / $230K RSU. I need $205K base and $215K RSU/4yr to choose HashiCorp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build HashiCorp's infrastructure intelligence platform — the predictive models, growth analytics, and ML systems that make Terraform and HCP smarter for every user. I'm holding a Datadog offer at $195K base / $210K RSU/4yr and a Databricks offer at $200K base / $230K RSU. HashiCorp's infrastructure data is uniquely valuable, and I want to be the one building intelligence on top of it. I need $205K base, $215K RSU/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $205K, I commit immediately. My floor is $185K — below that, the Databricks equity and data platform are too compelling."
