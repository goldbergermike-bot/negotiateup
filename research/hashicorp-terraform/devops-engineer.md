**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at HashiCorp are in the extraordinary position of building and operating the tools that define the DevOps industry itself. You'll use Terraform, Vault, Consul, and Nomad to manage HashiCorp's own infrastructure — dogfooding at its most intense — while also building the CI/CD, deployment, and reliability systems for HCP. Post-IBM acquisition, DevOps Engineers face expanded scope: integrating HashiCorp's infrastructure practices with IBM's enterprise operations, harmonizing deployment pipelines, and ensuring HCP maintains its 99.99% SLA under increasing enterprise load. This is a role where you literally write the playbook that thousands of DevOps teams worldwide follow.

### 🏗️ HCP Reliability & IBM Operations Integration Lever
HashiCorp Cloud Platform's enterprise credibility depends on world-class reliability — and in 2026, DevOps Engineers are scaling HCP's operational posture to IBM enterprise standards while maintaining HashiCorp's agile deployment velocity. This dual mandate — enterprise reliability plus startup speed — is the critical DevOps challenge at HashiCorp. Use this: "HCP's enterprise customers demand 99.99% reliability while the platform ships features at startup velocity. DevOps Engineers who can build systems that deliver both are the backbone of HashiCorp's enterprise credibility. My experience with [Kubernetes / Terraform at scale / multi-cloud operations] directly addresses this challenge."

**Global Levers**
1. **Dogfooding Premium:** "I'll be using HashiCorp's own tools to run HashiCorp's infrastructure — every operational insight I generate becomes product intelligence. That dual-value (operations + product feedback) justifies $193K base, above market for a DevOps role."
2. **IBM Enterprise Operations Alignment:** "Harmonizing HashiCorp's deployment practices with IBM's enterprise operations requirements is a multi-year initiative. I bring experience with [enterprise compliance / change management / ITIL processes] that accelerates this integration — $190K RSU/4yr."
3. **HCP SLA Ownership:** "Maintaining 99.99% uptime for HCP enterprise customers directly protects HashiCorp's ARR. DevOps Engineers who own SLA compliance are revenue-critical — I'd like a $25K signing bonus and on-call compensation clarity."
4. **Competing Infrastructure Offers:** "I'm holding a Datadog offer at $178K base / $185K RSU for infrastructure operations and a GitLab offer at $172K base / $175K RSU. I need $193K base and $190K RSU/4yr to choose HashiCorp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the operational backbone of HCP — the CI/CD, reliability, and deployment systems that let HashiCorp ship enterprise infrastructure at startup speed. I'm holding a Datadog offer at $178K base / $185K RSU/4yr. HashiCorp is the only company where my DevOps work directly improves the tools that the entire industry relies on. I need $193K base, $190K RSU/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $193K, I'm in. My floor is $175K — below that, Datadog's observability platform and liquid equity are the stronger choice."
