**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at PwC build data infrastructure for the firm's data and analytics consulting practice, internal audit analytics, and the Digital Accelerator's data products. PwC's data practice supports critical business functions — audit analytics, tax data processing, and consulting data infrastructure. Data engineers may be deployed on client engagements or work on internal platforms that support PwC's 350,000+ employees. PwC's comp structure is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. The unique value proposition is exposure to regulated industries — financial services, healthcare, and government — where data engineering has unique compliance and governance requirements.

**Global Levers**

1. **Regulated Industry Data Expertise:** "Building data infrastructure for audit, tax, and regulated industries gives me compliance and governance expertise that's rare and valuable."
2. **Audit Analytics Foundation:** "PwC's audit practice depends on data infrastructure. My work directly enables the firm's most regulated and high-stakes service line."
3. **Accenture RSU Comparison:** "Accenture offers RSU grants to data engineers. PwC needs a higher base to compensate for this equity gap."
4. **GenAI Data Foundation:** "PwC's AI investments require robust data infrastructure. Data engineers building GenAI data pipelines are in high demand."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building data infrastructure for PwC's most critical service lines. I need $150K base with a 15% guaranteed bonus and a $12K signing bonus. Accenture offers RSUs worth $50K that PwC doesn't match." PwC will counter at $130K-$140K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $165K+.
