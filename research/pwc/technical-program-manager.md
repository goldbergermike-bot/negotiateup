### Technical Program Manager | PwC Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | Firm-Wide Technology Programs

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $120K-$165K | $0-$25K (senior only) | $12K-$33K (10-20%) | $132K-$223K |
| Chicago | $115K-$155K | $0-$20K (senior only) | $12K-$31K (10-20%) | $127K-$206K |
| London | £82K-£120K | £0-£18K (senior only) | £8K-£24K (10-20%) | £90K-£162K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at PwC coordinate complex technology programs — platform migrations, security overhauls, Digital Accelerator product launches, and firm-wide technology transformations. PwC's TPM role involves managing programs that affect 350,000+ employees and thousands of clients across regulated industries. The scale of PwC's technology transformation creates demand for experienced TPMs who can navigate both technical complexity and the firm's partnership culture. Comp is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. TPMs who deliver high-visibility programs are strong candidates for the partner track.

**Level Mapping:** PwC Manager (TPM) = Google L4-L5 TPM = Amazon Senior TPM = Deloitte Manager TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Firm-Wide Program Scale:** "My programs affect 350,000+ PwC employees and the technology infrastructure supporting thousands of client engagements."
2. **Digital Accelerator Delivery:** "Managing Digital Accelerator product launches means driving PwC's most innovative technology initiatives to production."
3. **Regulated Compliance Programs:** "Technology programs at PwC must meet audit, tax, and financial regulatory requirements — a compliance layer that adds significant complexity."
4. **FAANG TPM Comp Gap:** "TPMs at FAANG earn $280K-$380K TC. PwC needs to narrow this gap for experienced program managers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm managing firm-wide technology programs at massive scale. I need $160K base with an 18% guaranteed bonus and a $15K signing bonus. FAANG TPM roles offer $300K-$360K TC." PwC will counter at $140K-$150K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $190K.
