**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at PwC work within the firm's Cybersecurity & Risk practice — one of the Big 4's largest security consulting operations. PwC's security practice serves financial institutions, government agencies, healthcare organizations, and Fortune 500 companies. Security engineers may work on client-facing engagements (penetration testing, incident response, security architecture) or protect PwC's internal infrastructure that handles sensitive audit and financial data. PwC handles material non-public financial information for thousands of public companies — making internal security critically important. Comp is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. [Source: PwC Cybersecurity & Risk Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** PwC Senior Associate / Manager (Cyber) = Google L4 Security = CrowdStrike Senior = Deloitte Senior Consultant (Cyber)

**Global Levers**

1. **Financial Data Sensitivity:** "PwC handles non-public financial data for thousands of public companies. A security breach could trigger SEC investigations and destroy client trust."
2. **Dual Role Value:** "I'm both a security practitioner (protecting PwC) and a security consultant (advising clients). This dual skill set has significant market value."
3. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers are the most supply-constrained talent in tech. Pure-play security companies pay $250K-$380K TC."
4. **Government Clearance Premium:** "If holding security clearances: government and defense engagements command a 15-20% premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm protecting PwC's financial data and advising clients on cybersecurity. I need $160K base with an 18% guaranteed bonus and a $15K signing bonus. Security companies offer $260K-$340K TC." PwC will counter at $140K-$150K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $185K.
