### Software Engineer | PwC Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | Big 4 Growing Tech Practice

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $110K-$155K | $0-$25K (senior only) | $11K-$31K (10-20%) | $121K-$211K |
| Chicago | $105K-$145K | $0-$20K (senior only) | $11K-$29K (10-20%) | $116K-$194K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at PwC work across the firm's growing technology consulting practice, building client solutions, internal platforms, and the firm's suite of proprietary technology products. PwC ($53B revenue) is the second-largest Big 4 firm and has been aggressively investing in technology capabilities — including AI, cloud, and digital transformation. PwC's comp structure features lower base than MBB or tech companies, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity only at senior levels (Director+). The firm's structured career ladder provides clear progression from Associate to Partner, with each level bringing increased comp. PwC's technology practice serves financial services, healthcare, and government clients. [Source: PwC Technology Consulting 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** PwC Associate / Senior Associate = Google L3 = Deloitte Analyst/Consultant = Accenture Analyst

**Global Levers**

1. **Career Progression Clarity:** "PwC's structured promotion ladder means clear, predictable career progression from Associate to Partner. I'm investing in this trajectory."
2. **Client Billing Revenue:** "PwC bills my time at $175-$300/hour. At 1,600 billable hours, I generate $280K-$480K in revenue."
3. **Accenture/Deloitte Comp Comparison:** "Accenture offers RSUs; Deloitte offers slightly higher base. PwC needs to be competitive through base and bonus."
4. **Partner Track Economics:** "The partner track at PwC leads to $500K-$2M+ comp. I need competitive short-term comp to make this long-term investment worthwhile."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about PwC's technology practice and career trajectory. I need $150K base with a 15% guaranteed bonus and a $12K signing bonus. Accenture's offer includes RSUs worth $50K that PwC doesn't match." PwC will counter at $130K-$140K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $165K+.
