**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at PwC lead technology delivery teams at the Director level — managing engineers for both client engagements and internal platform development. At this level, PwC's comp includes higher bonus (15-25%) and emerging equity grants. EMs are accountable for team delivery, utilization, and talent development while navigating PwC's partnership culture. The Director level is 2-4 years from Partner, making this a critical retention point. PwC has been hiring experienced engineering managers from tech companies to build its technology leadership capability. The Digital Accelerator program has created demand for EMs who can lead product-oriented engineering teams. [Source: PwC Technology Engineering Management 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** PwC Director = Google L5-L6 EM = Deloitte Manager/SM = Accenture Manager

**Global Levers**

1. **Partner Track Proximity:** "I'm 2-4 years from Partner ($500K-$1.5M+ comp). My current package should reflect this proximity and the firm's investment in my progression."
2. **Team Delivery P&L:** "I own delivery P&L for engagements worth $3M-$12M annually. My management directly determines engagement profitability."
3. **Talent Retention Impact:** "My effectiveness as an EM directly reduces attrition across my team, saving $200K+ per engineer replacement cost."
4. **Equity Escalation:** "At the Director level, equity should be meaningful ($50K+) to signal commitment to my partner track."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm leading engineering teams and progressing toward Partner. I need $185K base, 20% guaranteed bonus, equity of $45K over 4 years, and a $22K signing bonus. Tech EM roles offer $380K-$470K TC." PwC will counter at $165K-$175K base with $25K-$35K equity. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $240K.
