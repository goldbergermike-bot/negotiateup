**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at PwC design technology architectures for client consulting engagements — enterprise transformations, cloud migrations, and digital modernization projects. SAs at PwC operate at the Director level, with enhanced bonus (15-25%) and emerging equity grants. They serve as the technical authority for engagements and contribute to pre-sales, helping PwC win competitive pitches against Deloitte, Accenture, and cloud providers. PwC's SA role is particularly strong in financial services and regulated industries, where architecture decisions must account for compliance, governance, and data sovereignty requirements.

**Level Mapping:** PwC Director (SA) = AWS Senior SA = Google Cloud Customer Engineer (L5) = Deloitte SM (SA)

**Global Levers**

1. **Regulated Industry Architecture:** "I design architectures for financial services, healthcare, and government — industries with unique compliance requirements. This regulatory expertise commands a premium."
2. **Engagement Revenue Enablement:** "My architecture work enables engagements worth $5M-$50M. My technical credibility is what makes these deals viable."
3. **Pre-Sales Technical Authority:** "My architecture presentations help PwC win competitive pitches. I'm selling, not just delivering."
4. **Cloud Provider SA Benchmark:** "SAs at AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure earn $270K-$390K TC. PwC needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm designing architectures for PwC's largest client engagements. I need $180K base, 20% guaranteed bonus, equity of $40K over 4 years, and a $20K signing bonus. Cloud provider SA roles offer $290K-$370K TC." PwC will counter at $160K-$170K base with $20K-$30K equity. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $235K.
