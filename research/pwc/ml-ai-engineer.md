**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at PwC build production AI systems for the firm's consulting practice, audit automation, and the Digital Accelerator program. PwC is investing heavily in AI — particularly for audit and tax automation, where ML models can analyze financial data, detect anomalies, and automate compliance checks. ML/AI engineers at PwC benefit from regulated industry exposure: building AI for financial audit, tax processing, and healthcare compliance requires unique domain expertise. PwC's comp structure is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. The firm competes for ML talent with both MBB and tech companies.

**Global Levers**

1. **Audit AI Impact:** "ML models for audit automation directly impact PwC's largest revenue stream. My AI work makes audit more accurate, efficient, and valuable."
2. **Regulated AI Expertise:** "Building AI for regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government) gives me compliance-aware ML skills that are increasingly valuable as AI regulation expands."
3. **AI Company Comp Gap:** "ML engineers at AI companies earn $350K-$550K TC. Even MBB pays $228K-$345K. PwC's $132K-$234K needs to be narrowed significantly."
4. **GenAI Premium:** "ML engineers with LLM/GenAI expertise command a premium. PwC's GenAI investments require this talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building AI systems for PwC's audit practice and consulting clients. I need $165K base with an 18% guaranteed bonus and a $18K signing bonus. MBB pays $250K-$340K for comparable ML roles." PwC will counter at $145K-$155K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $195K.
