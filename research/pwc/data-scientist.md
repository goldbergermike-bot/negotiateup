### Data Scientist | PwC Global Negotiation Guide

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at PwC work across the firm's AI and analytics consulting practice, building predictive models, AI solutions, and analytics for clients in financial services, healthcare, government, and other regulated industries. PwC's data science practice is growing rapidly as the firm invests in AI capabilities for audit, tax, and consulting. Data scientists at PwC benefit from exposure to regulated environments — building AI for financial compliance, healthcare diagnostics, and government analytics requires unique domain expertise. PwC's comp structure is lower base, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. The career progression to Partner offers long-term comp significantly above current levels.

**Level Mapping:** PwC Senior Associate / Manager (Data Science) = Google L4 DS = Deloitte Manager (DS) = Accenture Consultant (AI)

**Global Levers**

1. **Regulated AI Expertise:** "Building AI for audit, tax, and regulated industries gives me compliance-aware ML expertise that's increasingly valuable as AI regulation expands globally."
2. **Audit AI Automation:** "PwC's audit practice is the largest in the world. AI that improves audit quality and efficiency directly impacts the firm's most critical revenue stream."
3. **MBB Data Scientist Comp Gap:** "Data scientists at MBB earn $220K-$360K TC. PwC's $132K-$234K leaves a significant gap that should be narrowed."
4. **GenAI Premium:** "Data scientists with GenAI/LLM expertise command a 15-20% premium. PwC's AI investment requires this expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm bringing data science expertise to PwC's AI practice and regulated industry clients. I need $165K base with an 18% guaranteed bonus and a $18K signing bonus. MBB pays $250K-$350K for comparable roles." PwC will counter at $145K-$155K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $195K.
