### Security Engineer — Cloudflare Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers at Cloudflare protect the internet and architect the Zero Trust infrastructure that makes Edge Sovereignty enterprise-ready, commanding a 10-15% security premium while securing AI Inference workloads across the global network.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | Austin (USD) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $165,000–$210,000 | $150,000–$192,000 | £82,000–£102,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $218,000–$305,000 | $198,000–$280,000 | £106,000–£148,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $290,000–$405,000 | $265,000–$370,000 | £140,000–£192,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Cloudflare

Cloudflare's February 10 record earnings showcased the company's position as the internet's security layer. The $42.5M ACV deal was fundamentally a security deal — the enterprise customer chose Cloudflare because its Edge Sovereignty and Zero Trust capabilities provided the security posture required to run AI Inference workloads with full data sovereignty compliance. Security Engineers who build and maintain these capabilities are directly responsible for Cloudflare's enterprise revenue.

As a Security Engineer at Cloudflare, you protect traffic flowing through 330+ cities, secure the AI Inference pipeline against adversarial attacks, build the Zero Trust framework that enterprises depend on, and architect the Edge Sovereignty compliance infrastructure that enables data residency guarantees. Your work is the foundation of enterprise trust.

Security Engineers command a 10-15% premium over general software engineers at Cloudflare because the talent pool is smaller and the stakes are higher. RSU grants reflect this premium. The February 10 earnings and the $42.5M ACV deal both validate that security is Cloudflare's core value proposition — and your negotiation should emphasize that security engineering is the moat that protects the AI Inference platform.

#### Cloudflare Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Public Title | Internal Level | Typical YOE |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Security Engineer | L3-L4 | 2-5 years |
| Senior Security Engineer | L5 | 5-8 years |
| Staff Security Engineer | L6 | 8-12 years |
| Principal Security Engineer | L7+ | 12+ years |

### 🌐 Cloudflare AI Inference & Edge Sovereignty Lever

Cloudflare's February 10 record earnings and $42.5M ACV deal prove the AI Inference division is driving massive enterprise value. I negotiate as an Edge Sovereignty leader who monetizes AI traffic across 330+ cities. Security Engineers are the trust layer that enables this monetization — without security guarantees, enterprise customers will not commit to the AI Inference platform.

The February 10 earnings highlighted the growth of Zero Trust and SASE revenue, driven by Security Engineers who build the Edge Sovereignty compliance frameworks that enterprises require. The $42.5M ACV deal included stringent security requirements — data residency guarantees across 330+ cities, AI Inference pipeline security, model integrity protection, and Zero Trust access controls. Security Engineers delivered all of these.

Your negotiation leverage is compounded by the global nature of the threat landscape. Securing AI Inference workloads across 330+ cities requires expertise in cryptography, access control, threat detection, compliance frameworks, and distributed security architecture. This combination of skills commands the highest premiums in the market.

Cite the February 10 earnings and security's central role: "The February 10 record earnings and $42.5M ACV deal were won on security trust. I will architect the Zero Trust and Edge Sovereignty security infrastructure that protects AI Inference workloads across your 330+ city network, enabling enterprise confidence at scale."

#### Global Lever 1: Workers & Edge Compute Platform

Security Engineers for Workers ensure sandboxing, isolate security, and supply chain integrity across 330+ cities. Negotiation language: "I will secure the Workers execution environment for AI Inference workloads, ensuring isolate security and supply chain integrity across your 330+ city network."

#### Global Lever 2: Zero Trust & SASE Security

This is the core lever for Security Engineers — building the Zero Trust platform that enables Edge Sovereignty. Negotiation language: "I will architect the Zero Trust framework that makes Edge Sovereignty enterprise-ready, delivering the security capabilities that drove the $42.5M ACV deal and February 10 record earnings."

#### Global Lever 3: AI Gateway & Model Serving

AI Gateway security means protecting model endpoints, securing inference data, and preventing adversarial attacks. Negotiation language: "I will secure the AI Gateway and AI Inference pipeline against adversarial attacks and data exfiltration, protecting the enterprise trust that enables deals like the $42.5M ACV milestone."

#### Global Lever 4: Developer Platform & R2 Storage

Developer platform security covers data encryption, access control, and compliance for storage and database services. Negotiation language: "I will secure the developer platform data layer — R2, D1, KV — ensuring AI Inference data and Edge Sovereignty compliance across Cloudflare's storage infrastructure."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $225,000 base with 1,150 RSUs ($149,500/yr at NET ~$130). Accept-at floor: $365,000 total comp. Cite the February 10 earnings, $42.5M ACV milestone, and your Edge Sovereignty expertise in the AI Inference division.
