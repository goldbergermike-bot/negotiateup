*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Cloudflare

Cloudflare's February 10 record earnings spotlighted the AI Inference division as the fastest-growing business segment. The $42.5M ACV deal was driven by AI Inference capabilities that ML/AI Engineers built and optimized — model serving at the edge, intelligent caching, inference cost optimization, and Edge Sovereignty-compliant model deployment. ML/AI Engineers are the technical core of Cloudflare's AI strategy, and they command the highest compensation premiums in the engineering organization.

As an ML/AI Engineer at Cloudflare, you design and implement the AI Inference serving infrastructure that runs across 330+ cities. You optimize model quantization for edge deployment, build intelligent caching layers that reduce inference costs, design model routing systems that balance latency and accuracy, and ensure Edge Sovereignty compliance for AI workloads. This is the most technically demanding and commercially valuable engineering work at Cloudflare.

RSU grants for ML/AI Engineers at Cloudflare carry a 10-15% premium over general software engineering grants, reflecting the scarcity of engineers who understand both ML systems and distributed edge computing. The February 10 earnings showed accelerating AI Inference revenue, and the $42.5M ACV deal proved that enterprises will pay significant premiums for edge AI capabilities. Your negotiation should be anchored to the direct revenue impact of your AI Inference engineering work.

#### Cloudflare Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Public Title | Internal Level | Typical YOE |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| ML/AI Engineer | L3-L4 | 2-5 years |
| Senior ML/AI Engineer | L5 | 5-8 years |
| Staff ML/AI Engineer | L6 | 8-12 years |
| Principal ML/AI Engineer | L7+ | 12+ years |

### 🌐 Cloudflare AI Inference & Edge Sovereignty Lever

Cloudflare's February 10 record earnings and $42.5M ACV deal prove the AI Inference division is driving massive enterprise value. I negotiate as an Edge Sovereignty leader who monetizes AI traffic across 330+ cities. ML/AI Engineers are at the absolute center of this value creation — you build the systems that serve AI models at the edge, the core capability that differentiates Cloudflare from every other cloud provider.

The February 10 earnings called out AI Inference as the company's highest-priority investment area. Cloudflare's 330+ city network gives it a structural advantage that no hyperscaler can match — the ability to serve AI models within milliseconds of end users everywhere on earth. The $42.5M ACV deal was won because ML/AI Engineers built an AI Inference platform that delivers Edge Sovereignty — customers can run models at the edge while keeping data within jurisdictional boundaries.

Your negotiation position is the strongest of any engineering role at Cloudflare. The intersection of ML engineering, distributed systems, and edge computing is an extremely narrow talent pool. Cloudflare is competing for your skills against every AI lab, hyperscaler, and startup in the market. The 10-15% ML premium is justified by both the scarcity of your skills and the revenue impact of your work.

Frame your negotiation explicitly: "The February 10 record earnings and $42.5M ACV deal validate that AI Inference is Cloudflare's growth engine. I build the ML systems that serve models across 330+ cities with Edge Sovereignty compliance — this is the most commercially valuable engineering work at the company, and my compensation should reflect that."

#### Global Lever 1: Workers & Edge Compute Platform

ML/AI Engineers optimize the Workers runtime for AI Inference workloads — model loading, GPU scheduling, and inference execution. Negotiation language: "I will optimize the Workers platform for AI Inference serving, enabling sub-100ms model execution across your 330+ city network and driving the performance that won the $42.5M ACV deal."

#### Global Lever 2: Zero Trust & SASE Security

ML-powered security includes anomaly detection, threat classification, and adversarial ML defense. Negotiation language: "I bring ML security expertise that will strengthen Cloudflare's Zero Trust platform with AI-powered threat detection, enhancing the Edge Sovereignty security posture that enterprises demand."

#### Global Lever 3: AI Gateway & Model Serving

This is the primary lever for ML/AI Engineers — building the AI Gateway model serving infrastructure. Negotiation language: "I will architect the AI Gateway inference engine — model routing, intelligent caching, cost optimization — that converts your 330+ city network into the world's largest AI Inference platform, directly driving revenue like the $42.5M ACV deal."

#### Global Lever 4: Developer Platform & R2 Storage

ML/AI Engineers build model storage, versioning, and deployment infrastructure on R2. Negotiation language: "I will build the model storage and deployment pipeline on R2 that enables seamless AI Inference and Edge Sovereignty compliance across Cloudflare's 330+ city network."
