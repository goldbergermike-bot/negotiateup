#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Cloudflare

Cloudflare's February 10 record earnings were a validation of the Product Management organization's strategic bets. The $42.5M ACV deal was not just a sales win — it was the result of Product Managers identifying enterprise customer needs, defining Edge Sovereignty capabilities, and prioritizing AI Inference features that delivered measurable business value. Product Managers who can drive this kind of strategic impact command top-tier compensation.

At Cloudflare, Product Managers operate at the intersection of technology and market strategy. You define the products that run across 330+ cities, shape the AI Inference division's roadmap, and make prioritization decisions that affect billions of dollars in enterprise revenue. The $42.5M ACV deal was closed because Cloudflare's products — as defined by Product Managers — met a critical enterprise need for Edge Sovereignty and AI Inference at scale.

The February 10 earnings underscored that Cloudflare's product-led growth strategy is working. RSU grants for Product Managers reflect the company's understanding that great product thinking is scarce and high-impact. Your negotiation should emphasize your ability to identify market opportunities in AI Inference, define Edge Sovereignty product features, and drive adoption across the 330+ city network.
