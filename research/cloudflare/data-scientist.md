#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Cloudflare

Cloudflare's February 10 record earnings were built on data-driven decisions — from pricing optimization to traffic pattern analysis to AI Inference demand forecasting. The $42.5M ACV deal was informed by data science models that identified the customer's usage patterns, predicted growth trajectories, and quantified the value of Edge Sovereignty capabilities. Data Scientists who can derive these insights from Cloudflare's massive data estate are exceptionally valuable.

At Cloudflare, Data Scientists work with one of the most unique datasets in the world — traffic telemetry from 330+ cities, security threat intelligence, AI Inference usage metrics, and developer adoption patterns. This data powers the strategic decisions that drive revenue growth, product development, and the Edge Sovereignty roadmap.

RSU grants for Data Scientists at Cloudflare are competitive with engineering grants, particularly at the Senior and Staff levels. The February 10 earnings validated that data-driven decision-making is core to Cloudflare's strategy, and the $42.5M ACV deal demonstrated that data science directly contributes to revenue. Your negotiation should emphasize your ability to turn Cloudflare's unique data assets into strategic insights for the AI Inference division.

#### Cloudflare Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Public Title | Internal Level | Typical YOE |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Data Scientist | L3-L4 | 2-5 years |
| Senior Data Scientist | L5 | 5-8 years |
| Staff Data Scientist | L6 | 8-12 years |
| Principal Data Scientist | L7+ | 12+ years |

### 🌐 Cloudflare AI Inference & Edge Sovereignty Lever

Cloudflare's February 10 record earnings and $42.5M ACV deal prove the AI Inference division is driving massive enterprise value. I negotiate as an Edge Sovereignty leader who monetizes AI traffic across 330+ cities. Data Scientists are uniquely positioned to quantify and optimize the value that Cloudflare's AI Inference platform delivers to enterprise customers.

The February 10 earnings revealed that AI Inference workloads are generating increasingly predictable revenue streams. Data Scientists who can model these streams, forecast demand across 330+ cities, and optimize pricing for Edge Sovereignty capabilities directly impact Cloudflare's bottom line. The $42.5M ACV deal was sized using data science models that projected the customer's AI Inference consumption.

Your negotiation leverage comes from the uniqueness of Cloudflare's data. No other company has telemetry from 330+ cities across every continent, combined with AI Inference usage data and Edge Sovereignty compliance metrics. Your ability to work with this data at scale — building models that drive product decisions, pricing strategies, and enterprise deal sizing — is what makes you invaluable.

Cite the February 10 earnings: "I will build the data models that forecast AI Inference demand, optimize Edge Sovereignty pricing, and inform the deal structures that drive results like your February 10 record earnings and $42.5M ACV milestone across 330+ cities."

#### Global Lever 1: Workers & Edge Compute Platform

Data Scientists analyze Workers usage patterns, cold start distributions, and compute efficiency across 330+ cities. Negotiation language: "I will build analytics models that optimize Workers performance for AI Inference workloads, driving the platform efficiency that enables Edge Sovereignty at scale."
