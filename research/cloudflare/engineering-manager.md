#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Cloudflare

Cloudflare's February 10 record earnings placed a spotlight on the Engineering Managers who lead the teams building the company's most strategic products. The $42.5M ACV deal — the largest in company history — was closed because Cloudflare's engineering organization delivered Edge Sovereignty and AI Inference capabilities that no competitor could match. Engineering Managers are the force multipliers who make this delivery possible.

As an Engineering Manager at Cloudflare, you lead teams that operate across the company's 330+ city global network. You hire, develop, and retain the engineers who build the AI Inference serving layer, the Workers runtime, the Zero Trust platform, and the Edge Sovereignty compliance framework. Your ability to scale engineering teams while maintaining velocity directly impacts Cloudflare's ability to close enterprise deals like the $42.5M ACV milestone.

The February 10 earnings showed that Cloudflare is investing heavily in headcount growth, particularly in AI Inference and edge platform teams. RSU grants for Engineering Managers are competitive with Staff-level IC grants, reflecting the company's recognition that strong engineering leadership is essential to executing on the Edge Sovereignty roadmap. Your negotiation should emphasize both your people leadership and your technical ability to guide teams building AI Inference systems.
