### Product Designer | Snowflake Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | CEO-Led AI Platform Pivot | TOP-OF-MARKET Initial Grants

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo / Bozeman | $160K–$205K | $180K–$300K | None | $205K–$280K |
| Seattle | $155K–$200K | $170K–$285K | None | $198K–$271K |
| Warsaw | PLN 300K–420K | PLN 160K–260K | None | PLN 460K–680K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Designers at Snowflake are reshaping how data practitioners interact with the AI data platform. The Streamlit acquisition made Snowflake a first-party tool for building data apps — and designers own the experience. Snowflake Notebooks, Cortex AI interfaces, and the Snowsight web UI all need design investment as the platform evolves from warehouse to AI platform. The design team is compact (1:25+ designer-to-engineer ratio), meaning each designer shapes a significant product surface. No-bonus model applies — equity is everything.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake Senior Designer = Google L4 UX = Databricks Senior Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Platform UX Scarcity:** "Data platform UX design is a specialized skill — the intersection of data visualization, developer experience, and enterprise UX. This specialization commands a premium."
2. **Streamlit/Notebooks Design:** If designing Streamlit or Snowflake Notebooks experiences, you're shaping the developer experience for thousands of data scientists. Frame as: "My design work determines adoption of Snowflake's developer tools."
3. **AI Interface Design Premium:** Designing Cortex AI interfaces requires conversational UX and AI transparency skills. Push for 10-15% premium.
4. **Compact Team Impact:** "The design team is 1:25 with engineering. Each designer I replace takes months to hire. My impact per designer is higher than at companies with 1:8 ratios."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $280K over 4 years. My data platform UX expertise is directly applicable to Snowflake's AI pivot, and the compact design team means my impact is outsized." Counter at $240K-$260K RSUs is competitive.
