**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Snowflake are building and training the models that power Cortex AI — Snowflake's AI inference and fine-tuning runtime. Snowflake's Arctic LLM (an open-source enterprise-focused model released in 2024) was built by internal DS/ML researchers. The Snowpark ML framework enables customers to train models directly within Snowflake, and DS roles on this team are defining how Snowflake's platform supports ML workloads. Snowflake's data advantage is unique: billions of queries processed daily across thousands of enterprise customers create a proprietary understanding of data patterns and query optimization.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake Senior DS = Google L4 DS = Databricks Senior DS = Meta IC4 DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Cortex AI / Arctic Model Development:** If working on Cortex AI or Arctic LLM, you're building Snowflake's competitive moat against Databricks. Push for the 20-35% Agentic AI premium.
2. **Snowpark ML Platform:** If building the ML platform (Snowpark ML, ML Functions, Model Registry), frame as: "I'm building the platform that every Snowflake customer uses for ML — this is platform-level impact."
3. **Query Optimization Intelligence:** Snowflake's query optimizer uses ML to improve performance. DS roles on the optimizer team have direct revenue impact (faster queries = more consumption).
4. **Databricks DS Counter:** Databricks pays 15-20% cash bonus for DS roles. Push Snowflake's equity higher to compensate.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $400K over 4 years. My ML expertise in [foundation models / ML platforms / query optimization] directly applies to Cortex AI, and I have a Databricks offer with pre-IPO equity plus cash bonus." Counter at $360K-$380K RSUs is strong.
