**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Snowflake build the internal data infrastructure that powers the platform's intelligence. This includes the data pipelines that feed product analytics, customer usage patterns, query optimization models, and Cortex AI training data. There's a delightful meta-quality to this role: you're a data engineer building the world's leading data engineering platform. The Datavolo acquisition (January 2025, Apache NiFi-based data integration) adds a data integration layer that data engineers are helping to integrate into the core platform.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake Senior DE = Databricks Senior DE = Google L4 DE = MongoDB Senior DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Meta-Platform Frame:** "I'm a data engineer building the world's leading data platform. The standard of data engineering at Snowflake is higher than anywhere else because we're our own showcase."
2. **Datavolo Integration:** If working on the Datavolo integration, push for a premium: "I'm integrating the company's latest acquisition into the core data platform."
3. **Query Optimization Data Pipelines:** If your pipelines feed the query optimizer or Cortex AI models, frame as: "My data pipelines directly improve query performance and AI capabilities for every Snowflake customer."
4. **Databricks/MongoDB DE Counter:** Both compete for the same DE talent. Use competing offers.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $400K over 4 years. I'm building the data infrastructure for the world's leading data platform — the standard is higher here than anywhere else." Counter at $350K-$380K RSUs is competitive.
