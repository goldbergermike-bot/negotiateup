**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps/Platform Engineers at Snowflake manage the multi-cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP) that powers the Snowflake Data Cloud. Snowflake's architecture runs on all three major clouds simultaneously, creating unique infrastructure challenges. The Cortex AI workloads add GPU cluster management and ML serving infrastructure. Snowflake's consumption-based billing means infrastructure efficiency directly impacts gross margin — every optimization a platform engineer delivers translates to profitability improvement.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake Senior Platform Eng = Google L4 SRE = AWS Senior Infra Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Cloud Complexity:** "Snowflake runs on AWS, Azure, and GCP simultaneously. Managing infrastructure across three clouds is 3x the complexity of a single-cloud company. My comp should reflect this multi-cloud expertise."
2. **Gross Margin Impact:** "Snowflake's consumption model means every infrastructure optimization I deliver directly improves gross margin. A 1% efficiency gain at $4B+ revenue = $40M+ annual impact."
3. **GPU Infrastructure Premium:** If managing GPU clusters for Cortex AI, push for AI infrastructure premium: "GPU cluster management for AI inference is a specialized skill with a market premium."
4. **Cloud Provider Counter-Offers:** AWS, GCP, and Azure all recruit from this talent pool. Use hyperscaler offers to push Snowflake equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $400K over 4 years. My multi-cloud infrastructure expertise directly maps to Snowflake's unique architecture, and I'm comparing with [hyperscaler] offers." Counter at $350K-$380K RSUs is competitive.
