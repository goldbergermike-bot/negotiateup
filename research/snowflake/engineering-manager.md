### Engineering Manager | Snowflake Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | CEO-Led AI Platform Pivot | TOP-OF-MARKET Initial Grants

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo / Bozeman | $240K–$280K | $400K–$640K | None | $340K–$440K |
| Seattle | $235K–$275K | $380K–$610K | None | $330K–$428K |
| Warsaw | PLN 460K–600K | PLN 380K–560K | None | PLN 840K–1.16M |

**Negotiation DNA**

EMs at Snowflake lead compact, high-output engineering teams (typically 5-8 direct reports). The company is relatively small (~7,500 employees) compared to revenue, meaning each EM has outsized organizational impact. The AI pivot has created new teams (Cortex AI, Arctic ML, AI Platform) that need experienced EMs to build and scale. Snowflake's no-bonus model means the EM comp is base + large equity. At this level, equity grants are substantial ($400K-$640K), and the EM is expected to be technically strong enough to make architecture decisions alongside their Staff ICs.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake EM = Google L5 Manager = Databricks EM = Salesforce EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Small Company, Big Impact:** "Snowflake has ~7,500 employees generating $4.3B+ in revenue. The revenue-per-employee is among the highest in SaaS. My management scope at Snowflake has 3-5x the impact of managing a similar team at a 70K-person company."
2. **AI Team Building Premium:** If building a new Cortex AI or ML team from scratch, push for a premium: "I'm not inheriting a team — I'm building one from zero for the company's #1 strategic priority. Team building carries more risk and more impact than team management."
3. **IC Parity:** Snowflake Staff ICs can earn $500K+ in equity. EMs must at minimum match this. Push for EM equity above the Staff IC band.
4. **Retention Criticality:** In a competitive talent market against Databricks, every engineer on your team has a standing offer from DBX. Frame: "Retaining my team against Databricks poaching is a core EM deliverable. My comp should reflect this retention mandate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $600K over 4 years. I'm building/managing a team at the center of the AI pivot, and I need comp that exceeds the Staff ICs I'm managing. I'm also evaluating EM roles at Databricks and Google." Counter at $520K-$560K RSUs is competitive. Push for a sign-on ($25K-$40K) to bridge the cliff.
