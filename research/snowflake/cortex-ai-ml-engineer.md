**Negotiation DNA**

This is Snowflake's signature role for 2026 — the Cortex AI / Arctic ML Engineer. You're building the AI runtime that transforms Snowflake from a data warehouse into an AI data platform. This role encompasses two interrelated domains: Cortex AI (the managed AI service that lets customers run LLM inference, fine-tuning, and ML functions inside Snowflake) and Arctic (Snowflake's proprietary open-source LLM family optimized for enterprise data tasks). No other company offers this exact combination: AI model development + enterprise data platform + multi-cloud deployment + consumption-based monetization. This role is the core of CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy's strategic vision. [Source: Snowflake Cortex AI / Arctic Team 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake Cortex/Arctic Eng (Senior) = Databricks Mosaic ML Eng = Google L4-L5 ML = Meta FAIR Senior

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Cortex AI / Arctic ML Engineer works across the full AI model lifecycle inside an enterprise data platform:
- **Foundation Model Development (Arctic):** Training and optimizing enterprise-focused LLMs — Arctic models are designed for SQL generation, data understanding, and enterprise reasoning
- **Cortex AI Runtime:** Building the managed inference runtime that serves AI models at enterprise scale with multi-tenant isolation
- **In-Platform ML Functions:** Creating ML functions (classification, summarization, embedding generation) that run natively inside Snowflake SQL
- **Fine-Tuning Infrastructure:** Enabling customers to fine-tune models on their private Snowflake data without data leaving the platform
- **Multi-Cloud Model Serving:** Deploying AI models consistently across AWS, Azure, and GCP

**Global Levers**

1. **CEO Vision Alignment:** "Sridhar Ramaswamy left Google to lead Snowflake's AI transformation. Cortex AI is his vision — and I'm building it. My work has direct CEO visibility and company-defining impact. The equity should reflect that."
2. **Databricks Mosaic ML Counter:** Databricks acquired Mosaic ML for $1.3B to build similar capabilities. Frame: "Databricks spent $1.3B acquiring the team doing what I would build at Snowflake. That acquisition price quantifies the value of this skill set."
3. **Agentic AI Premium (20-35%):** "Cortex AI enables autonomous data analysis, SQL generation, and document understanding inside Snowflake. Building the AI runtime for enterprise data autonomy is the definition of agentic AI engineering."
4. **Open-Source Model Leadership:** If you have experience with open-source ML models, Arctic's open-source strategy makes this directly transferable. Frame: "My open-source ML experience directly applies to Arctic's community-driven development model."
5. **Multi-Cloud AI Serving:** Deploying AI models consistently across AWS, Azure, and GCP is a rare skill. Push for a premium: "Multi-cloud AI model serving at enterprise scale is a problem very few engineers have solved."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $440K total comp, with RSUs at $600K over 4 years. This is Snowflake's most strategically important engineering role — building the CEO's core vision for the company's AI transformation. I have competing offers from Databricks (pre-IPO equity at $62B, the Google 2004 moment) and from [AI-native company]. Snowflake's top-of-market equity reputation needs to hold at this level." Snowflake will counter at $520K-$580K RSUs — accept at $550K+ with a guaranteed first-year refresh. This is an exceptional package for a role that defines Snowflake's future.
