### ML/AI Engineer | Snowflake Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | CEO-Led AI Platform Pivot | **+20–35% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo / Bozeman | $215K–$275K | $360K–$600K | None | $305K–$425K |
| Seattle | $210K–$270K | $340K–$570K | None | $295K–$413K |
| Warsaw | PLN 420K–560K | PLN 340K–520K | None | PLN 760K–1.08M |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Snowflake are building Cortex AI (the LLM inference and fine-tuning runtime inside Snowflake), Arctic LLM (Snowflake's open-source enterprise-focused model), and the ML infrastructure that powers Snowpark ML. This is the highest-premium engineering role at Snowflake — the 20-35% Agentic AI premium applies directly. Snowflake is racing against Databricks to establish credibility as THE AI data platform, and ML/AI engineers are the frontline troops in this battle. The CEO-led AI pivot means Sridhar Ramaswamy personally reviews AI product progress — your work has CEO visibility. [Source: Snowflake AI/ML 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake Senior ML Eng = Databricks Senior ML = Google L4 ML = Anthropic Senior

**Global Levers**

1. **Agentic AI Premium (20-35%):** "Cortex AI enables customers to run LLM inference and fine-tuning inside Snowflake. Building the AI runtime for a $4.3B data platform is the highest-leverage ML engineering in enterprise SaaS. I expect the full agentic premium."
2. **Databricks vs. Snowflake AI Race:** "Snowflake and Databricks are in a direct race for AI platform dominance. I'm the talent that tips the balance. Both companies are recruiting me — and I expect Snowflake to demonstrate its commitment through top-of-market comp."
3. **Arctic LLM Experience:** If you have foundation model training experience, this is directly applicable to Arctic LLM development. Push for a research-track premium.
4. **AI-Native Company Alternatives:** Offers from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Cohere create maximum urgency. Frame: "I'm choosing between an AI-native company and building AI within an established data platform. The equity must justify staying in enterprise vs. going AI-native."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $425K total comp, with RSUs at $560K over 4 years. The 20-35% agentic AI premium should be fully applied — I'm building Snowflake's competitive moat against Databricks. I have competing interest from Databricks (pre-IPO equity) and [AI-native company]." Counter at $480K-$540K RSUs is strong. Push for $520K+.
