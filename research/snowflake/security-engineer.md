**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Snowflake protect the data platform that stores some of the world's most sensitive enterprise data. The April 2024 Snowflake customer credential stuffing incident (affecting Ticketmaster, AT&T, and others) demonstrated both the criticality of security at Snowflake and the company's investment in improving its security posture. Post-incident, Snowflake has invested heavily in security engineering — mandatory MFA, enhanced access controls, and improved threat detection. Security engineers who join post-incident are building a stronger security foundation and are highly valued. Cortex AI introduces new attack surfaces (prompt injection, model poisoning, data exfiltration via AI queries) that require specialized AI security expertise. [Source: Snowflake Security 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake Senior Security Eng = CrowdStrike Senior Eng = Google L4 Security

**Global Levers**

1. **Post-Incident Investment Frame:** "Snowflake invested heavily in security after the 2024 credential incident. I'm joining at the point of maximum security investment — and my comp should reflect the strategic priority security now carries."
2. **Customer Data Protection:** "Snowflake stores the most sensitive enterprise data on the planet. My work directly protects the trust that generates $4.3B in revenue."
3. **AI Security Premium:** Cortex AI creates new threat vectors. Push for 20-35% premium if you have AI security expertise.
4. **Cybersecurity Competing Offers:** CrowdStrike, Zscaler, and Okta offers include cash bonuses. Push Snowflake equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $420K over 4 years. My security expertise in [AI security / cloud data security] is directly applicable to Snowflake's post-incident security investment, and I have competing offers from cybersecurity companies with cash bonuses." Counter at $370K-$400K RSUs is strong.
