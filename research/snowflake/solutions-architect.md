### Solutions Architect | Snowflake Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | CEO-Led AI Platform Pivot | TOP-OF-MARKET Initial Grants

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo / Bozeman | $180K–$225K | $220K–$380K | None | $235K–$320K |
| Seattle | $175K–$220K | $210K–$360K | None | $228K–$310K |
| London | £115K–£150K | £120K–£195K | None | £145K–£199K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Snowflake Solutions Architects bridge the gap between the data platform and enterprise customer deployments. With the AI pivot, SAs are now architecting Cortex AI deployments, Snowpark ML pipelines, and data-sharing architectures that leverage Snowflake's unique cross-cloud data marketplace. Snowflake SAs are highly technical (many are former data engineers) and work directly with enterprise data teams. The consumption-based pricing model means SA recommendations directly impact customer spending — well-architected deployments lead to efficient consumption and long-term retention.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake Senior SA = Databricks Senior SA = AWS Senior SA

**Global Levers**

1. **Consumption Optimization Influence:** "My architecture recommendations directly impact customer consumption patterns. A well-designed Snowflake deployment can reduce cost-per-query by 30-50%, driving higher adoption and long-term retention."
2. **Cortex AI Deployment Expertise:** SAs who can architect Cortex AI and ML workloads are in acute demand. Push for a premium if you have ML deployment experience.
3. **Snowflake Certification Value:** SnowPro Advanced certifications carry significant market value. Leverage them for 10-15% premium.
4. **Databricks SA Counter:** Databricks SAs receive cash bonuses. Push Snowflake equity higher to compensate.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $350K over 4 years. My enterprise data architecture experience and Cortex AI deployment skills justify top-of-band placement." Counter at $310K-$340K RSUs is acceptable.
