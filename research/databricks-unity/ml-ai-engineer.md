| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options+RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $205K–$262K | $225K–$395K | 12–18% | $312K–$435K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Databricks Unity ML/AI Engineers build the Mosaic AI infrastructure and model serving capabilities that are governed by Unity Catalog — creating the end-to-end AI lifecycle platform where models, features, and experiments are all tracked, governed, and auditable through the universal governance layer. This is the intersection of AI infrastructure and governance that makes Databricks unique in the market. Pre-IPO equity at $62B+ valuation creates exceptional leverage — ML/AI engineers building the AI governance infrastructure should negotiate for 30% more shares before the listing.

Mosaic AI's integration with Unity Catalog is the strategic differentiator that enterprise customers cannot get elsewhere — governed AI from data ingestion through model deployment. Your infrastructure work directly enables the AI-native enterprise platform that justifies the $62B+ valuation.

### 🏗️ Databricks Unity Catalog Governance Lever
In February 2026, ML/AI Engineers are building the governed AI infrastructure at the center of Databricks' strategy — integrating Mosaic AI model training, serving, and evaluation with Unity Catalog's governance to create end-to-end AI lifecycle management. Enterprise customers require governed AI that is auditable, compliant, and reproducible.

Your work on the intersection of Mosaic AI and Unity Catalog governance creates the infrastructure that enables enterprises to deploy AI with confidence — model lineage, experiment tracking, feature governance, and serving infrastructure all governed through a single unified platform.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% More Pre-IPO Shares + AI Premium:** "I build the governed AI infrastructure integrating Mosaic AI with Unity Catalog. Pre-IPO equity at $62B+ has asymmetric upside — I want 30% more shares because governed AI is the strategic differentiator driving enterprise adoption."
2. **Mosaic AI + Unity Catalog Integration:** "I build the AI lifecycle infrastructure governed by Unity Catalog — model training, serving, and evaluation with full lineage and compliance. This governed AI platform exists nowhere else in the industry."
3. **OpenAI/Google ML Competition:** "OpenAI ML engineers earn $435K+ TC. Google ML L5 earns $442K+ TC. Databricks must offer 30% more pre-IPO shares plus an AI infrastructure premium to attract ML talent."
4. **Enterprise AI Governance Demand:** "Enterprise demand for governed AI is exploding in 2026. I build the infrastructure that makes Databricks the only platform where AI is governed end-to-end — from data to deployment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $258K base and 30% more shares than the standard equity offer for this ML/AI Engineer role building governed AI infrastructure before the 2026 IPO. I integrate Mosaic AI with Unity Catalog to create end-to-end governed AI — the strategic differentiator for 10,000+ enterprises. I have competing offers from [OpenAI ML at $435K TC / Google ML L5 at $442K TC]. Pre-IPO equity has asymmetric upside." Accept at $238K+ base and 20%+ more shares than standard.
