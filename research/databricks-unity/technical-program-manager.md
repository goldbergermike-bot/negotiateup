TPMs at Databricks are the execution backbone for the most strategically important programs heading into the 2026 IPO. Pre-IPO equity at $62B+ valuation creates leverage — your program execution directly determines whether critical governance features ship on time.

### 🏗️ Databricks Unity Catalog Governance Lever
In February 2026, TPMs are driving the most ambitious Unity Catalog programs — the expansion into universal AI governance, cross-cloud metadata federation, and enterprise compliance automation. These programs involve 10+ engineering teams and directly determine whether Databricks can ship the governance capabilities that enterprise customers need.

Your program execution determines whether critical governance features ship before the IPO — every quarter of delivery under your management converts roadmap vision into enterprise-ready product capabilities.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% More Pre-IPO Shares:** "I drive the cross-functional execution for Unity Catalog's most critical programs. Pre-IPO equity at $62B+ has asymmetric upside — my program delivery directly determines whether governance features ship before the IPO."
2. **Cross-Team Governance Execution:** "I coordinate 10+ engineering teams to deliver Unity Catalog's AI governance expansion — the most strategically important programs at Databricks heading into the IPO."
3. **Snowflake/Google TPM Competition:** "Snowflake TPMs earn $372K+ TC with liquid equity. Google TPM L5 earns $378K+ TC. Databricks must offer 30% more pre-IPO shares to attract TPM talent from public companies."
4. **Pre-IPO Execution Velocity:** "I drive the program execution that converts Unity Catalog roadmap into shipped features. My delivery velocity directly impacts the governance capabilities available at IPO."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $235K base and 30% more shares than the standard equity offer for this TPM role driving Unity Catalog programs before the 2026 IPO. I coordinate the cross-functional execution for the most strategically important governance programs. I have competing offers from [Snowflake TPM at $372K TC / Google TPM L5 at $378K TC]. Pre-IPO TPM equity has asymmetric upside." Accept at $218K+ base and 20%+ more shares than standard.
