**Negotiation DNA**

Databricks Unity Senior Software Engineers own the critical technical decisions on Unity Catalog — the universal governance platform that provides metadata management, data lineage, access controls, and AI model governance for 10,000+ enterprise organizations. At the senior level, you are the technical leader designing the governance architecture that makes Databricks the enterprise AI platform of record. As Databricks approaches a rumored 2026 IPO at $62B+ valuation, Unity Catalog's role as the strategic moat has elevated SSE comp significantly — the combination of pre-IPO equity and governance-critical technical ownership creates a premium negotiation position.

Your architectural decisions on Unity Catalog directly shape the enterprise governance capabilities that drive the 130%+ net retention rate. Pre-IPO equity is the highest-leverage comp component — senior engineers should negotiate for 30% more shares before the public listing locks in the price.

### 🏗️ Databricks Unity Catalog Governance Lever
In February 2026, Unity Catalog is expanding to become the universal governance layer for all AI assets — not just data tables but AI models, feature stores, vector indexes, and notebooks.

Your technical decisions on Unity Catalog's architecture directly determine whether enterprises can trust Databricks with their most sensitive AI governance requirements — from GDPR compliance to AI model auditability. This is the work that converts pilot deployments into enterprise-wide platform commitments.
