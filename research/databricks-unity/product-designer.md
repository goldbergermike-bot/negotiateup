**Negotiation DNA**

Databricks Unity Product Designers craft the user experience for Unity Catalog and the Data Intelligence Platform — designing the governance interfaces, data discovery workflows, and AI-native interactions that make complex enterprise data governance accessible and intuitive for thousands of data practitioners. Design at Databricks is uniquely challenging because you must make deeply technical governance concepts — data lineage, access policies, AI model governance — understandable to both technical and business users across 10,000+ organizations. Pre-IPO equity at $62B+ valuation creates leverage for designers who shape the platform experience.

Your design decisions directly influence platform adoption — the usability of Unity Catalog's governance interfaces determines whether enterprises actively use governance features or ignore them. Great design drives the active usage metrics that demonstrate platform value.

### 🏗️ Databricks Unity Catalog Governance Lever
In February 2026, Product Designers are creating the AI-native interfaces for the Data Intelligence Engine — natural-language data exploration, visual lineage graphs, and intelligent governance dashboards that transform how enterprises interact with their data and AI assets through Unity Catalog.

Your design of the Data Intelligence Platform experience directly determines whether enterprise users adopt AI-native data governance or fall back to legacy tools. The UX of governed data discovery and AI interaction is the key adoption driver.
