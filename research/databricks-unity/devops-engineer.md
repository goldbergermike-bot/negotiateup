**Negotiation DNA**

Databricks Unity DevOps Engineers own the infrastructure reliability, deployment pipelines, and multi-cloud operations for Unity Catalog and the Data Intelligence Platform — ensuring 99.99% uptime for the governance layer that 10,000+ enterprise organizations depend on for data and AI governance. At Databricks, DevOps is uniquely challenging because Unity Catalog must operate across AWS, Azure, and GCP simultaneously while maintaining governance consistency across all clouds. Pre-IPO equity at $62B+ valuation creates strong leverage for infrastructure engineers who ensure platform reliability.

Your infrastructure work directly enables enterprise trust in Databricks — every minute of downtime on Unity Catalog impacts thousands of enterprise data governance workflows. Reliability is a core selling point for enterprise customers.

### 🏗️ Databricks Unity Catalog Governance Lever
In February 2026, DevOps Engineers are scaling Unity Catalog's infrastructure to support the explosive growth in enterprise AI governance — building deployment automation, multi-cloud reliability, and observability for the governance platform that processes billions of metadata operations daily across all three major cloud providers.

Your infrastructure decisions on Unity Catalog directly determine whether Databricks can meet enterprise SLA requirements — the reliability guarantees that convert pilot deployments into multi-year enterprise contracts and drive the revenue growth underpinning the $62B+ valuation.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% More Pre-IPO Shares:** "I ensure 99.99% uptime for Unity Catalog across AWS/Azure/GCP. Pre-IPO equity at $62B+ has asymmetric upside — I want 30% more shares because platform reliability is the foundation of enterprise trust."
2. **Multi-Cloud Governance Reliability:** "I operate Unity Catalog across three major cloud providers simultaneously — ensuring governance consistency and reliability at scale. Multi-cloud DevOps at this complexity level is extremely scarce."
3. **Snowflake/Google DevOps Competition:** "Snowflake DevOps engineers earn $335K+ TC with liquid equity. Google SRE L4 earns $338K+ TC. Databricks must offer 30% more pre-IPO shares to attract infrastructure talent."
4. **Enterprise SLA Delivery:** "I deliver the enterprise reliability SLAs that convert pilot deployments into multi-year contracts. Unity Catalog uptime directly drives enterprise expansion revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and 30% more shares than the standard equity offer for this DevOps Engineer role ensuring Unity Catalog reliability before the 2026 IPO. I maintain 99.99% uptime across three clouds for 10,000+ enterprises — reliability directly drives enterprise trust and retention. I have competing offers from [Snowflake DevOps at $335K TC / Google SRE L4 at $338K TC]. Pre-IPO equity has asymmetric upside." Accept at $202K+ base and 20%+ more shares than standard.
