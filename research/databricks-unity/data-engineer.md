### 🏗️ Databricks Unity Catalog Governance Lever
In February 2026, Data Engineers on Unity Catalog are building the data integration layer that makes the Data Intelligence Engine possible — automated data quality checks, lineage tracking, and governance-aware ETL pipelines that scale across multi-cloud environments. Enterprise demand for governed data pipelines is at an all-time high as organizations prepare for AI-native workflows.

Your pipelines are the foundation that ensures Unity Catalog has complete, accurate, and governed metadata for every data asset in the enterprise — the data quality that powers the Data Intelligence Engine and drives enterprise confidence in Databricks as the AI platform of record.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% More Pre-IPO Shares:** "I build the governed data pipelines feeding Unity Catalog — the metadata foundation for the Data Intelligence Engine. Pre-IPO equity at $62B+ has asymmetric upside. I want 30% more shares before the listing window closes."
2. **Data Quality Foundation:** "I build the data quality and lineage infrastructure that makes Unity Catalog trustworthy for 10,000+ enterprises. Without reliable data pipelines, the governance layer and Data Intelligence Engine cannot function."
3. **Snowflake/Google DE Competition:** "Snowflake Data Engineers earn $332K+ TC with liquid equity. Google DE L4 earns $335K+ TC. Databricks must offer 30% more pre-IPO shares to attract data engineers from public companies."
4. **AI-Ready Data Infrastructure:** "I build the pipelines that make enterprise data AI-ready — governance-aware ETL that ensures every data asset flowing into Mosaic AI and the Data Intelligence Engine is compliant, discoverable, and auditable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base and 30% more shares than the standard equity offer for this Data Engineer role building Unity Catalog pipelines before the 2026 IPO. I build the governed data infrastructure feeding 10,000+ enterprises — my pipelines are the foundation of the Data Intelligence Engine. I have competing offers from [Snowflake DE at $332K TC / Google DE L4 at $335K TC]. Pre-IPO equity has asymmetric upside." Accept at $198K+ base and 20%+ more shares than standard.
