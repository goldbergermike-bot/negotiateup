### Technical Program Manager — Airwallex Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Airwallex's Compliance Resilience strategy, translating the $8B Series G valuation and Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit into a technical program management compensation framework spanning Melbourne, San Francisco, and London markets. As a Technical Program Manager at Airwallex, you orchestrate the delivery of cross-functional programs that span engineering, compliance, legal, and business teams — your coordination ensures that complex payment system initiatives ship on time, on spec, and within regulatory requirements.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇦🇺 Melbourne (AUD) | A$155,000 – A$210,000 | A$65,000 – A$140,000 | A$220,000 – A$350,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $185,000 – $245,000 | $80,000 – A$170,000 | $265,000 – $415,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £90,000 – £130,000 | £40,000 – £85,000 | £130,000 – £215,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Technical Program Managers at Airwallex manage programs with regulatory deadlines that cannot slip. A compliance program that misses its deadline can delay market launches, trigger regulatory findings, or block the $590M investment. This program criticality — combined with the cross-functional coordination complexity of payments infrastructure — commands a premium over standard TPM roles. The $8B valuation creates options value, but your primary lever is base salary tied to program scope and compliance criticality.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Airwallex Level | Wise Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent | Nium Equivalent |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| TPM | Program Manager | TPM (L5) | Program Manager |
| Senior TPM | Senior PM | Senior TPM (L6) | Senior PM |

Stripe TPMs at L5/L6 earn $200K-$270K base in SF. Wise Program Managers in London are £95K-£135K. Airwallex TPM comp should match Wise with options upside. The regulatory dimension of Airwallex programs — compliance deadlines, audit preparation, licensing timelines — adds scope that generic TPM roles lack.

#### 🛡️ Airwallex Compliance Resilience & Reliability Leads Lever

The **Series G $8B valuation** was achieved through disciplined execution of complex cross-functional programs — market launches, regulatory certifications, and platform migrations that a TPM coordinates. The **Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit** was a program management achievement: coordinating engineering, compliance, legal, and operations teams to prepare documentation, evidence, and system demonstrations on a regulatory timeline.

As a Technical Program Manager, you are a **Reliability Lead** for program execution. You ensure that compliance programs deliver on time, that audit preparation is coordinated across teams, and that market launches meet regulatory deadlines. The **$590M UK/Regional investment** funds programs you will manage — new market launches, regulatory certifications, and infrastructure buildouts that require cross-functional orchestration.

**How to leverage this in negotiation:**
- Regulatory programs have hard deadlines that cannot be negotiated — this is high-stakes program management
- The AUSTRAC audit preparation was a TPM-coordinated effort — you are joining to extend this capability
- The $590M expansion creates 10+ major programs across markets, each requiring TPM leadership
- TPMs who understand financial regulatory timelines and requirements are scarce

> "Managing technical programs with regulatory deadlines — like AUSTRAC audit preparation or FCA licensing — is fundamentally different from standard agile delivery management. These programs have non-negotiable deadlines with direct financial consequences. The $590M expansion will create major cross-functional programs that need this expertise. I'm targeting A$200,000 base with A$125,000 in options."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Regulatory Program Complexity Premium**
Programs with regulatory deadlines carry higher stakes than standard feature delivery.
> "The programs I'll manage at Airwallex have regulatory deadlines that directly impact licensing and market access. This is fundamentally different scope than standard engineering program management. I'm targeting A$205,000 base to reflect the regulatory complexity and non-negotiable timeline pressure."

**Lever 2 — Cross-Functional Scope**
Airwallex programs span engineering, compliance, legal, operations, and business teams. This breadth is a premium.
> "The TPM role at Airwallex requires coordinating engineering, compliance, legal, operations, and business stakeholders across multiple time zones. This cross-functional scope exceeds typical TPM roles and justifies A$202,000 base."

**Lever 3 — Market Launch Program Ownership**
Each new market launch is a major program. Negotiate for explicit program ownership.
> "I'd like to own the program management for at least one market launch tied to the $590M expansion. This scope — coordinating regulatory certification, infrastructure buildout, and product launch — represents Senior TPM-level work. I'm targeting A$205,000 base with a path to Senior TPM."

**Lever 4 — Audit Preparation as Program Discipline**
Audit preparation is a specialized program management skill. Frame your experience.
> "I've managed [SOX/PCI/regulatory] audit preparation programs at [current company], coordinating technical evidence, documentation, and system demonstrations across X teams. This audit-readiness program management is directly transferable to Airwallex. I'm targeting A$198,000 base."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 80th percentile. For Melbourne, push for A$200,000+ base with A$125,000+ options (4yr vest). Your accept-at floor should be A$170,000 base with A$80,000 options. In San Francisco, target $235,000 base / $155,000 options with a floor of $198,000 / $95,000. In London, target £122,000 / £78,000 options with a floor of £100,000 / £48,000. TPMs should negotiate for explicit program ownership (name the programs in the offer discussion), a PMP/program management certification budget, and a written path to Senior TPM with a comp step-up within 12-18 months based on program delivery outcomes.
