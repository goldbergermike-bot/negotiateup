### Engineering Manager — Airwallex Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Airwallex's Compliance Resilience strategy, translating the $8B Series G valuation and Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit into an engineering management compensation framework spanning Melbourne, San Francisco, and London markets. As an Engineering Manager at Airwallex, you lead teams whose output is directly audited by financial regulators — your leadership determines both velocity and compliance posture across critical payment systems.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇦🇺 Melbourne (AUD) | A$185,000 – A$245,000 | A$120,000 – A$240,000 | A$305,000 – A$485,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $220,000 – $280,000 | $150,000 – $300,000 | $370,000 – $580,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £115,000 – £155,000 | £75,000 – £150,000 | £190,000 – £305,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering Managers at Airwallex carry dual accountability — delivery velocity and regulatory compliance. This dual mandate is rare in tech and commands premium compensation. Your teams build the transaction monitoring, ledger, FX, and KYC systems that AUSTRAC and FCA audit directly. The $8B valuation validates this model, and the $590M expansion investment creates urgent hiring needs under your leadership. Leverage the team-building mandate to push for top-of-band base and enhanced options.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Airwallex Level | Wise Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent | Nium Equivalent |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | EM (L5/M1) | Engineering Manager |
| Senior EM | Senior EM | EM (M2) | Director of Eng. |

Stripe EMs at M1 earn $250K-$320K base in SF with substantial RSUs. Wise EMs in London are £120K-£160K base. Airwallex EM comp should bracket between Wise and Stripe — closer to Stripe given the compliance complexity. Nium EM comp is your floor; reject any offer below Nium bands.

#### 🛡️ Airwallex Compliance Resilience & Reliability Leads Lever

The **Series G $8B valuation** directly reflects the strength of Airwallex's engineering organization — which you will lead. The **Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit** is an engineering management achievement as much as a technical one: it required coordinated effort across multiple teams to ensure systems met regulatory standards for data integrity, transaction monitoring, and reporting.

As an Engineering Manager, you are a **Reliability Lead** at the organizational level. You hire, develop, and retain the engineers whose code regulators audit. You set the engineering culture that prioritizes compliance alongside velocity. The **$590M UK/Regional investment** means you will be scaling teams, opening new engineering hubs, and establishing the management structure for Airwallex's next growth phase.

**How to leverage this in negotiation:**
- Your team's output is directly auditable — this is a fundamentally different management challenge than a typical SaaS EM role
- The AUSTRAC audit success demonstrates that Airwallex's engineering leadership model works — and you are being hired to extend it
- The $590M expansion requires hiring 50-100+ engineers — your team-building ability has direct revenue impact
- Compliance failures under your teams could cost Airwallex its licenses — this risk premium justifies top-tier compensation

> "Leading engineering teams in a regulated payments environment is fundamentally different from standard SaaS management. My teams' code will be directly examined during audits like the Jan 2026 AUSTRAC review. Combined with the team-scaling mandate driven by the $590M expansion, I believe a package of A$235,000 base with A$210,000 in options reflects this unique accountability."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Dual-Mandate Premium (Velocity + Compliance)**
Most EMs optimize for speed. You must optimize for speed AND regulatory compliance simultaneously.
> "At Airwallex, I'll be managing teams with dual KPIs — delivery velocity and compliance pass rates. This dual mandate requires a different management skill set than standard tech EMs. I have experience managing under [SOX/PCI/AML] constraints and believe A$238,000 base reflects the complexity of this role."

**Lever 2 — Team-Scaling Authority**
The $590M expansion means your headcount will grow significantly. Negotiate compensation that reflects your future scope.
> "The role will likely expand from managing X engineers to Y engineers within 12-18 months as the $590M UK/Regional investment drives hiring. I'd like my initial compensation to reflect the scope I'm being hired to grow into — A$240,000 base with options reflecting a Senior EM band."

**Lever 3 — Management Equity Premium**
EMs who retain top talent reduce the cost of attrition. Your retention impact has direct financial value.
> "Engineering attrition at Airwallex's scale costs A$150,000+ per departure in recruiting, onboarding, and lost productivity. My track record of maintaining sub-10% attrition on my teams has measurable financial impact. I'd like to see that reflected in an additional A$40,000 in options."

**Lever 4 — Reporting Structure & Influence**
Clarify your reporting line and ensure it matches the compensation band.
> "I want to confirm my reporting line — if I'm reporting to a VP/Director of Engineering with direct influence on platform architecture decisions, the compensation should reflect that strategic positioning. I'm targeting the Senior EM band at A$240,000 base."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 80th percentile. For Melbourne, push for A$235,000+ base with A$210,000+ options (4yr vest). Your accept-at floor should be A$198,000 base with A$140,000 options. In San Francisco, target $268,000 base / $270,000 options with a floor of $232,000 / $170,000. In London, target £148,000 / £135,000 options with a floor of £125,000 / £90,000. EMs have strong leverage because Airwallex's expansion plan requires management infrastructure. If base is capped, negotiate for management-tier benefits: executive coaching budget, conference speaking budget, and a written path to Senior EM/Director with a compensation step-up within 12 months.
