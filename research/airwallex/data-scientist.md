### Data Scientist — Airwallex Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Airwallex's Compliance Resilience strategy, translating the $8B Series G valuation and Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit into a data science compensation framework spanning Melbourne, San Francisco, and London markets. As a Data Scientist at Airwallex, you build the analytical models that detect fraud, optimize FX pricing, predict compliance risk, and quantify cross-border payment patterns across 150+ countries — your models are the intelligence layer that makes the platform both profitable and compliant.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇦🇺 Melbourne (AUD) | A$135,000 – A$185,000 | A$55,000 – A$120,000 | A$190,000 – A$305,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $165,000 – $225,000 | $70,000 – $150,000 | $235,000 – $375,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £80,000 – £115,000 | £35,000 – £75,000 | £115,000 – £190,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Scientists at Airwallex work with uniquely rich datasets — cross-border transaction flows, multi-currency FX data, KYC/AML signals, and behavioral patterns across 150+ countries. This data richness is a career accelerator and compensation lever. Your fraud detection and risk models directly protect the $8B valuation by preventing losses and satisfying AUSTRAC reporting requirements. Push for compensation that reflects both the regulatory impact of your work and the scarcity of data scientists with financial crime/compliance domain expertise.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Airwallex Level | Wise Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent | Nium Equivalent |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Scientist (L4) | Data Scientist |
| Senior Data Scientist | Senior DS | Senior DS (L5) | Senior DS |

Stripe Data Scientists at L4/L5 earn $180K-$250K base in SF. Wise DS comp in London is £85K-£125K. Airwallex should match Wise base with additional options upside from the pre-IPO position. Data Scientists at fintech competitors with compliance-focused models command a 10-15% premium over generalist DS roles.

#### 🛡️ Airwallex Compliance Resilience & Reliability Leads Lever

The **Series G $8B valuation** is partially a bet on Airwallex's data capabilities — the ability to process, analyze, and act on cross-border transaction data at global scale. The **Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit** directly examined the transaction monitoring and suspicious activity detection systems that your models power.

As a Data Scientist, you are a **Reliability Lead** for Airwallex's analytical intelligence. Your fraud detection models, risk scoring algorithms, and compliance analytics directly determine whether Airwallex meets its regulatory reporting obligations. The **$590M UK/Regional investment** depends on scaling these models to new markets with different risk profiles, regulatory thresholds, and transaction patterns.

**How to leverage this in negotiation:**
- Your models are directly referenced in regulatory filings and audit documentation
- AUSTRAC audit success depended on the accuracy and effectiveness of transaction monitoring models
- The $590M expansion requires adapting models to new markets — different fraud patterns, different regulatory thresholds
- Financial crime data scientists are the scarcest specialization in fintech talent markets

> "My transaction monitoring and fraud detection models will be directly examined during regulatory audits like the Jan 2026 AUSTRAC review. This is not exploratory data science — it's compliance-critical analytics where model performance has direct regulatory consequences. I'm targeting A$178,000 base with A$110,000 in options to reflect this accountability."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Financial Crime Analytics Premium**
Data scientists specializing in AML/fraud/compliance analytics are extremely scarce and well-compensated.
> "Financial crime data science is one of the scarcest specializations in the market. My experience building [specific fraud/AML model] at [current company] reduced false positives by X% while maintaining detection rates above Y%. I'm targeting A$180,000 base — consistent with the premium for this specialization."

**Lever 2 — Regulatory Impact Quantification**
Your models directly affect regulatory outcomes. Quantify the cost of model failure.
> "A single missed suspicious transaction can trigger regulatory action costing millions. My models have a track record of [specific performance metrics]. The regulatory risk mitigation I provide justifies top-of-band compensation at A$182,000 base."

**Lever 3 — Data Richness as Career Accelerator**
Airwallex's cross-border data is uniquely rich. Acknowledge this value while negotiating.
> "I recognize Airwallex's data environment is a career accelerator — but that's precisely because the complexity requires experienced data scientists who can work with multi-currency, multi-jurisdictional transaction data. I'd like compensation that matches this complexity at A$175,000 base."

**Lever 4 — Publication & Conference Rights**
Negotiate for the ability to publish research and attend conferences — this has career value beyond direct compensation.
> "I'd like to discuss publication rights for non-proprietary research and a conference budget. Being able to present at [specific conference] benefits both my career development and Airwallex's employer brand. I'd also like to ensure my total comp is competitive at A$175,000 base with A$105,000 options."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 80th percentile. For Melbourne, push for A$178,000+ base with A$110,000+ options (4yr vest). Your accept-at floor should be A$148,000 base with A$68,000 options. In San Francisco, target $215,000 base / $140,000 options with a floor of $180,000 / $85,000. In London, target £108,000 / £68,000 options with a floor of £88,000 / £42,000. Data Scientists should negotiate for explicit model ownership areas (fraud detection, FX optimization, risk scoring) and request a performance review tied to model metrics within 6 months — this creates a natural path to Senior DS promotion and compensation step-up.
