At Airwallex, your designs directly affect conversion rates on onboarding (KYC completion), transaction flows (AML disclosures), and cross-border payment experiences. The $8B valuation reflects a platform that has solved this design challenge at scale — and you are being hired to extend it. Push for top-of-band compensation by framing your work as compliance-UX, a specialized and scarce skill.

#### 🛡️ Airwallex Compliance Resilience & Reliability Leads Lever

The **Series G $8B valuation** was built on a product experience that makes complex cross-border payments feel simple — that is a design achievement. The **Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit** validates the compliance-first design philosophy: every KYC flow, every transaction confirmation, every regulatory disclosure was designed with audit-readiness in mind.

As a Product Designer, you are a **Reliability Lead** for the user experience. Your designs determine how users interact with compliance-critical flows — onboarding, identity verification, transaction monitoring alerts, and regulatory disclosures. The **$590M UK/Regional investment** means new market launches, each with unique regulatory UX requirements (FCA disclosures, MAS requirements, local payment method integrations).

**How to leverage this in negotiation:**
- Compliance-UX design is a specialized skill — most designers have never worked under regulatory constraints
- Your KYC/onboarding designs directly impact conversion metrics and regulatory compliance simultaneously
- The AUSTRAC audit examined user-facing compliance flows that you will own and improve
- The $590M expansion requires localizing compliance UX for new markets — each market has unique regulatory display requirements

> "Designing cross-border payment experiences that satisfy both user expectations and multi-jurisdictional regulatory requirements is a specialized skill. The AUSTRAC audit validated Airwallex's compliance-first design approach, and the $590M expansion creates new markets that need this expertise. I'm targeting A$158,000 base with A$80,000 in options."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Compliance-UX Specialization**
Designing for regulated environments (fintech, healthtech, govtech) is a rare and growing specialization.
> "My portfolio includes [KYC flows/regulatory disclosures/compliance dashboards] that increased completion rates by X% while satisfying [regulatory body] requirements. This compliance-UX specialization is scarce in the design market, and I'm targeting A$160,000 base to reflect it."

**Lever 2 — Conversion Impact Quantification**
Your designs directly affect KYC completion, transaction completion, and user activation — all measurable metrics.
> "I've improved KYC completion rates by X% and transaction flow conversion by Y% at [current company]. At Airwallex's scale, even a 1% improvement in onboarding conversion translates to significant revenue. I'd like compensation that reflects this measurable impact — A$155,000 base."

**Lever 3 — Design System Ownership**
If you will own or contribute to Airwallex's design system, this is infrastructure work that scales your impact.
> "Owning the design system means my work impacts every product surface at Airwallex. This infrastructure-level contribution should be compensated accordingly — I'm targeting A$162,000 base with a commitment to review after the design system launches."

**Lever 4 — Multi-Market Design Experience**
If you have experience designing for multiple markets/languages/regulatory contexts, this is directly valuable.
> "I've designed products for [X markets], handling localization, right-to-left layouts, and jurisdiction-specific compliance requirements. This multi-market experience is directly applicable to Airwallex's $590M expansion. I believe A$158,000 base with A$85,000 in options reflects this experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 75th percentile. For Melbourne, push for A$155,000+ base with A$78,000+ options (4yr vest). Your accept-at floor should be A$132,000 base with A$50,000 options. In San Francisco, target $192,000 base / $100,000 options with a floor of $162,000 / $62,000. In London, target £95,000 / £48,000 options with a floor of £78,000 / £30,000. Designers should negotiate for explicit product area ownership and request a portfolio review clause — if your designs measurably improve compliance metrics, you should have a written path to Senior Designer with a comp step-up within 12 months.
