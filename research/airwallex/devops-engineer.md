### DevOps Engineer — Airwallex Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Airwallex's Compliance Resilience strategy, translating the $8B Series G valuation and Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit into a DevOps engineering compensation framework spanning Melbourne, San Francisco, and London markets. As a DevOps Engineer at Airwallex, you build and maintain the infrastructure that keeps cross-border payment systems running with the reliability and auditability that financial regulators demand — your pipelines, monitoring, and deployment systems are the operational backbone regulators evaluate.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇦🇺 Melbourne (AUD) | A$140,000 – A$190,000 | A$55,000 – A$120,000 | A$195,000 – A$310,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $170,000 – $225,000 | $70,000 – $150,000 | $240,000 – $375,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £80,000 – £115,000 | £35,000 – £75,000 | £115,000 – £190,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: DevOps Engineers at Airwallex operate in a uniquely regulated infrastructure environment. Your CI/CD pipelines must produce auditable deployment artifacts. Your monitoring systems must meet regulatory uptime and incident-response requirements. Your infrastructure-as-code must satisfy compliance-as-code mandates. The $8B valuation depends on the operational reliability you provide — a single outage in payment processing has regulatory, financial, and reputational consequences. Push for compensation that reflects this critical infrastructure accountability.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Airwallex Level | Wise Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent | Nium Equivalent |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| DevOps Engineer | Infrastructure Eng. | Production Engineer (L4) | DevOps Engineer |
| Senior DevOps | Senior Infra Eng. | Production Engineer (L5) | Senior DevOps |

Stripe Production Engineers at L4/L5 earn $180K-$240K base in SF. Wise Infrastructure Engineers in London are £85K-£120K. Airwallex DevOps comp should match Wise with meaningful options premium. Financial infrastructure DevOps roles command a 10-20% premium over general DevOps due to compliance and audit requirements.

#### 🛡️ Airwallex Compliance Resilience & Reliability Leads Lever

The **Series G $8B valuation** depends on operational uptime and reliability — payment systems that go down cost customers money and trigger regulatory scrutiny. The **Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit** examined not just application code but infrastructure practices: deployment audit trails, access controls, monitoring coverage, and incident response procedures.

As a DevOps Engineer, you are literally a **Reliability Lead** — the original meaning of the term. Your infrastructure decisions determine system availability, deployment safety, and operational auditability. The **$590M UK/Regional investment** requires standing up infrastructure in new regions (UK, APAC) with compliance controls that satisfy FCA, MAS, and local regulatory requirements.

**How to leverage this in negotiation:**
- Your infrastructure is directly audited — deployment logs, access controls, and monitoring systems are regulatory evidence
- The AUSTRAC audit examined operational practices that you will own and extend
- The $590M expansion requires multi-region infrastructure buildout — a major DevOps initiative
- Payment infrastructure DevOps is a specialized and scarce skill set — general cloud engineers cannot easily transition

> "DevOps in a regulated payments environment is fundamentally different from standard cloud infrastructure work. My deployment pipelines, monitoring systems, and access controls are directly examined during audits like the Jan 2026 AUSTRAC review. The $590M regional expansion requires building compliant infrastructure across new jurisdictions. I'm targeting A$182,000 base with A$110,000 in options."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Regulated Infrastructure Premium**
Infrastructure in regulated financial services must satisfy audit requirements that general cloud infrastructure does not.
> "My infrastructure work at Airwallex must produce auditable deployment artifacts, maintain regulatory-grade access controls, and meet uptime SLAs that have compliance implications. This regulated infrastructure skillset commands a premium — I'm targeting A$185,000 base."

**Lever 2 — Multi-Region Buildout Scope**
The $590M expansion requires new infrastructure in new regions. This is a massive scope expansion.
> "The $590M UK/Regional investment means I'll be building infrastructure in new AWS/GCP regions with compliance controls that satisfy FCA, MAS, and local data sovereignty requirements. This multi-region scope justifies A$188,000 base with enhanced options."

**Lever 3 — On-Call & Incident Response Compensation**
Payment infrastructure DevOps includes high-stakes on-call rotations. Ensure compensation reflects this.
> "On-call for payment processing infrastructure carries significant responsibility — a P0 incident has direct financial impact on Airwallex's customers and regulatory standing. I'd like to discuss either explicit on-call compensation or a base adjustment to A$185,000 that accounts for this 24/7 accountability."

**Lever 4 — Platform Engineering Evolution**
DevOps at this scale evolves into Platform Engineering. Negotiate for the trajectory.
> "I see this role evolving from DevOps into Platform Engineering as Airwallex scales. I'd like to discuss a title trajectory to Senior DevOps/Platform Engineer within 12 months with a corresponding compensation step-up, starting from A$180,000 base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 80th percentile. For Melbourne, push for A$182,000+ base with A$108,000+ options (4yr vest). Your accept-at floor should be A$152,000 base with A$68,000 options. In San Francisco, target $215,000 base / $138,000 options with a floor of $182,000 / $82,000. In London, target £108,000 / £68,000 options with a floor of £88,000 / £42,000. DevOps engineers should negotiate for explicit SLA ownership, on-call compensation, and a professional development budget for cloud certifications (AWS/GCP) that have direct value to Airwallex's multi-cloud strategy.
