### Senior Software Engineer — Airwallex Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Airwallex's Compliance Resilience strategy, translating the $8B Series G valuation and Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit into a senior software engineering compensation framework spanning Melbourne, San Francisco, and London markets. As a Senior Software Engineer, you own critical subsystems in the cross-border payments stack — your technical decisions directly determine whether Airwallex passes regulatory audits and unlocks new market corridors.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇦🇺 Melbourne (AUD) | A$150,000 – A$195,000 | A$80,000 – A$160,000 | A$230,000 – A$355,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $185,000 – $230,000 | $100,000 – $200,000 | $285,000 – $430,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £90,000 – £125,000 | £50,000 – £100,000 | £140,000 – £225,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: At the Senior level, Airwallex expects you to own and architect compliance-critical systems — transaction monitoring, ledger reconciliation, FX pricing engines, or KYC/AML pipelines. Your leverage comes from the scarcity of engineers who can build regulated financial infrastructure at scale. The $8B valuation creates real options value — model scenarios at $12B, $16B, and $20B exit to understand your equity upside. Push hard on options grants; Airwallex has room to flex at this level.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Airwallex Level | Wise Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent | Nium Equivalent |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Senior Engineer (L5) | Senior Engineer | L3/L4 Software Engineer | Senior Engineer |
| Senior Engineer (L5+) | Staff Engineer (early) | L4 Software Engineer | Lead Engineer |

At the Senior level, Stripe typically pays 20-35% more in base but offers RSUs (public). Airwallex options at $8B with IPO trajectory can close or exceed that gap. Wise London bands are competitive but cap earlier. Position Airwallex offers against Stripe L3/L4 to establish the right ceiling — Airwallex should match or exceed Wise and significantly beat Nium.

#### 🛡️ Airwallex Compliance Resilience & Reliability Leads Lever

The **Series G $8B valuation** is your anchor point in every compensation conversation. This is not a speculative early-stage bet — Airwallex processes real transaction volume at scale and has institutional investor validation at the highest tier. The **Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit** is a watershed moment that separates Airwallex from competitors who treat compliance as an afterthought.

As a Senior Software Engineer, you are a **Reliability Lead** who architects the systems that regulators examine under the microscope. Your design decisions on data integrity, audit trails, and transaction monitoring directly determine audit outcomes. The successful AUSTRAC audit de-risks the **$590M UK/Regional investment** and opens expansion corridors that generate new revenue.

**How to leverage this in negotiation:**
- Emphasize that your systems are directly audited — this is not backend work that sits behind an abstraction layer
- The AUSTRAC success means Airwallex will pursue FCA (UK), MAS (Singapore), and other licenses — your expertise compounds
- The $590M investment is contingent on continued compliance excellence — your retention is a risk-mitigation priority
- Frame yourself as someone who has built or maintained systems under regulatory scrutiny — this is rare and commands a premium

> "The AUSTRAC audit success validates the engineering culture I want to be part of. My track record building [specific regulated system] at [current company] positions me to extend that reliability standard across new markets. Given the $590M UK expansion investment, I believe a base of A$185,000 with A$140,000 in options reflects the strategic value of this role."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Regulated Systems Expertise Premium**
Engineers who have built systems under regulatory scrutiny (SOX, PCI-DSS, AML/KYC) are scarce. Quantify this scarcity.
> "In my last role, I architected the transaction monitoring system that passed [regulatory body] examination. That experience — building systems that withstand regulatory audits — is directly transferable to Airwallex's AUSTRAC-audited platform. I've seen market data showing a 20-25% premium for regulated-systems engineers, and I'd like my offer to reflect that at A$188,000 base."

**Lever 2 — Options Acceleration & Refresh**
At the Senior level, negotiate for a larger initial grant and annual refresh commitments.
> "I understand the standard 4-year vest, but given the $8B valuation and potential IPO timeline, I'd like to discuss either a larger initial grant — moving from A$100,000 to A$150,000 in options — or a written commitment to annual refresh grants. My preference is the larger initial grant to maximize alignment during this critical pre-IPO period."

**Lever 3 — Architecture Ownership Premium**
Senior Engineers who own subsystems (payments core, ledger, FX engine) have disproportionate impact. Price accordingly.
> "The role description indicates ownership of [specific subsystem]. At my current company, I own a similar system processing $X in daily volume. System owners at this level of criticality should be compensated in the top decile — I'm targeting A$190,000 base."

**Lever 4 — Competing Offer Leverage**
If you have offers from Stripe, Wise, Square, or Adyen, use them strategically.
> "I have a competitive offer from [competitor] at [specific number]. I prefer Airwallex's mission and the pre-IPO upside, but I need the total compensation to be within 10% to make the transition. Can we explore closing that gap through a combination of base adjustment and additional options?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 80th percentile. For Melbourne, push for A$185,000+ base with A$140,000+ options (4yr vest). Your accept-at floor should be A$162,000 base with A$95,000 options. In San Francisco, target $220,000 base / $180,000 options with a floor of $195,000 / $120,000. In London, target £118,000 / £90,000 options with a floor of £98,000 / £60,000. At the Senior level, you have significantly more leverage — Airwallex's hiring pipeline for experienced regulated-systems engineers is thin. Never accept a first offer; always counter with specific numbers and a rationale tied to compliance complexity.
