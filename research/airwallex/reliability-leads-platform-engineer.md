### Reliability Leads Platform Engineer — Airwallex Salary Negotiation Guide

## SIGNATURE ROLE

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Airwallex's Compliance Resilience strategy, translating the $8B Series G valuation and Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit into a Reliability Leads Platform Engineering compensation framework spanning Melbourne, San Francisco, and London markets. The Reliability Leads Platform Engineer is the apex technical role in Airwallex's compliance infrastructure — you architect, build, and operate the platform systems that ensure every transaction, every API call, and every regulatory report meets the highest standards of reliability, auditability, and regulatory compliance across 150+ countries and multiple financial regulatory jurisdictions.

This is the **SIGNATURE ROLE** for the Airwallex Negotiate Up series because it sits at the exact intersection of platform engineering excellence and regulatory compliance mastery. No other role at Airwallex has as much direct, measurable impact on the company's ability to pass regulatory audits, maintain its licenses, and unlock the $590M UK/Regional investment. When AUSTRAC auditors examine Airwallex's systems, they are examining your platform.

---

#### Why This is the SIGNATURE ROLE

The Reliability Leads Platform Engineer embodies Airwallex's core thesis: that compliance resilience is a competitive advantage, not a cost center. While other fintech platforms treat reliability and compliance as separate concerns — with SREs managing uptime and compliance teams managing audits — Airwallex's model integrates these functions into a single platform engineering discipline. This integration is what passed the Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit. This integration is what protects the $8B valuation. And this integration is what you will own.

The role commands premium compensation because it requires an extraordinarily rare skill combination:
1. **Deep platform engineering expertise** — Kubernetes, service mesh, observability, CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code
2. **Financial regulatory knowledge** — AUSTRAC, FCA, MAS, FinCEN requirements for payment system reliability
3. **Compliance-as-code fluency** — translating regulatory requirements into automated, auditable technical controls
4. **Cross-jurisdictional architecture** — designing platform systems that satisfy different regulatory requirements simultaneously
5. **Incident response under regulatory scrutiny** — managing incidents where downtime has compliance, not just business, consequences

This combination is so rare that Airwallex competes with central banks, Tier 1 investment banks, and Big Tech infrastructure teams for this talent.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇦🇺 Melbourne (AUD) | A$195,000 – A$270,000 | A$150,000 – A$320,000 | A$345,000 – A$590,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $240,000 – $310,000 | $190,000 – $400,000 | $430,000 – $710,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £125,000 – £175,000 | £95,000 – £200,000 | £220,000 – £375,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Reliability Leads Platform Engineer commands Staff-to-Principal-level compensation because the role combines platform engineering depth with regulatory compliance expertise. This is not a standard SRE or platform engineering role — it is the role that determines whether Airwallex passes regulatory audits, maintains its licenses, and unlocks market expansion. The $8B valuation is directly tied to the reliability and compliance posture of the platform you build. Negotiate accordingly — push for top-of-band on both base and options, and demand a signing bonus that reflects the urgency of filling this critical role.

**Compensation Philosophy**: Airwallex's comp for this role should be benchmarked against three peer sets simultaneously:
1. **Fintech peers** (Stripe, Wise, Adyen) — for base salary floor
2. **Big Tech infrastructure** (Google SRE, AWS, Meta Production Engineering) — for total comp ceiling
3. **Tier 1 financial institutions** (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs) — for regulatory complexity premium

Your target should be the median of these three peer sets, which typically lands 15-25% above standard platform engineering roles.

**Detailed Competitor Benchmarks:**

| Company | Base (SF) | Equity (Annual) | Total Comp | Equity Type |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| Stripe (L5 Prod Eng) | $230K-$280K | $120K-$200K RSU | $350K-$480K | RSU (public) |
| Google (L5 SRE) | $220K-$270K | $150K-$250K RSU | $370K-$520K | RSU (public) |
| Wise (Senior SRE) | £110K-£150K | £40K-£80K RSU | £150K-£230K | RSU (public) |
| Adyen (Senior SRE) | EUR 120K-160K | EUR 50K-100K RSU | EUR 170K-260K | RSU (public) |
| Airwallex (Target) | $250K-$310K | $48K-$100K options | $430K-$710K* | Options (private) |

*Airwallex total comp includes options valued at grant date FMV with significant upside at IPO exit scenarios ($12B-$20B).

Airwallex's options create asymmetric upside compared to public company RSUs. At a $12B IPO, options granted at $8B have 50% upside. At $16B, options have 100% upside. At $20B, options have 150% upside. This is the core equity story you should use in negotiations — accept a modest base discount vs. Big Tech only if the options grant is large enough to exceed Big Tech RSU value at a reasonable exit multiple.

#### 🛡️ Airwallex Compliance Resilience & Reliability Leads Lever

This is the definitive section for the SIGNATURE ROLE — the Compliance Resilience and Reliability Leads lever is not just a negotiation tool for this role; it IS this role.

**The Series G $8B Valuation — What It Means for This Role:**
The $8B valuation is a direct endorsement of Airwallex's compliance-first infrastructure model. Investors at this stage (Sequoia, DST Global, Salesforce Ventures) are betting that Airwallex's platform reliability and regulatory posture will support continued growth into new markets and product lines. As the Reliability Leads Platform Engineer, you are the person who validates or invalidates this bet. Your platform decisions determine:
- Whether transaction processing meets 99.99%+ uptime SLAs that regulators require
- Whether audit trails are complete, immutable, and queryable for regulatory examinations
- Whether deployment pipelines produce the artifacts that compliance teams need for audit evidence
- Whether monitoring and alerting systems detect anomalies before they become regulatory incidents
- Whether infrastructure-as-code templates embed the compliance controls that new market launches require

**The Jan 2026 AUSTRAC Audit — Your Platform on the Witness Stand:**
The AUSTRAC audit is the most significant regulatory examination Airwallex has undergone. AUSTRAC auditors examined not just transaction data and compliance policies — they examined the platform infrastructure that produces, stores, and secures that data. Specific areas under audit that fall within the Reliability Leads Platform Engineer's domain:
- **Deployment audit trails**: Can Airwallex demonstrate who deployed what code, when, and with what approvals?
- **Data integrity controls**: Are transaction records immutable? Can they be reconstructed if needed?
- **Access management**: Who has access to production systems? How is access logged and reviewed?
- **Incident response**: How does Airwallex detect, respond to, and report platform incidents that affect transaction processing?
- **Disaster recovery**: Can Airwallex recover from a major platform failure without data loss?
- **Change management**: How are platform changes reviewed, approved, and tested before production deployment?

Every one of these audit areas is your direct responsibility. The AUSTRAC audit success is your resume; the next audit is your mandate.

**The $590M UK/Regional Investment — Your Platform Expansion:**
The $590M investment earmarked for UK and regional expansion requires:
- **New infrastructure regions**: Standing up compliant platform infrastructure in UK (FCA jurisdiction), Singapore (MAS jurisdiction), and other markets
- **Data sovereignty compliance**: Ensuring data residency requirements are met through platform architecture, not manual processes
- **Multi-jurisdictional observability**: Building monitoring and alerting that satisfies different regulatory requirements simultaneously
- **Compliance-as-code templates**: Creating reusable platform patterns that embed regulatory controls for new market launches
- **Cross-region disaster recovery**: Designing failover architectures that maintain compliance across jurisdictions

This is a multi-year, multi-million-dollar platform engineering initiative. You will lead the technical architecture.

**Reliability Leads — The Name IS the Role:**
The "Reliability Leads" concept is not just a lever for this role — it is the job description. You lead reliability. You ensure that every system, every pipeline, every deployment, and every incident response procedure meets the standard that protects a $8B valuation, passes AUSTRAC audits, satisfies FCA requirements, and enables the $590M expansion. You are the person regulators want to talk to when they examine Airwallex's platform infrastructure.

**How to leverage this in negotiation — the definitive script:**

> "The Reliability Leads Platform Engineer role is the lynchpin of Airwallex's compliance infrastructure. My platform decisions directly determine whether Airwallex passes regulatory audits — like the Jan 2026 AUSTRAC examination — and whether the $590M UK/Regional investment can be deployed into compliant infrastructure. This role requires an exceptionally rare combination of platform engineering expertise and financial regulatory knowledge. I've built similar compliance-grade platform infrastructure at [current company] that passed [specific audit/examination]. Given the strategic criticality of this role and the scarcity of qualified candidates, I'm targeting A$258,000 base with A$290,000 in options (4yr vest). This positions me at the intersection of fintech platform engineering and regulatory infrastructure — which is exactly where Airwallex needs me."

#### Global Levers — Extended for SIGNATURE ROLE

**Lever 1 — Compliance Infrastructure Ownership Premium**
You own the platform that regulators audit. This is the most direct form of compliance accountability in engineering.
> "My platform infrastructure is what AUSTRAC auditors examine when they evaluate Airwallex's systems. Deployment audit trails, access controls, data integrity, disaster recovery — these are all platform engineering responsibilities that directly determine audit outcomes. This compliance infrastructure ownership commands a premium of 20-30% over standard platform engineering roles. I'm targeting A$260,000 base."

**Lever 2 — Pre-IPO Options at Platform-Critical Level**
As the engineer who protects the $8B valuation through platform reliability, your options grant should reflect your impact.
> "The $8B valuation depends on platform reliability. A major platform outage in payment processing doesn't just cost revenue — it triggers regulatory scrutiny and erodes the valuation I'm hired to protect. I'd like an options package of A$300,000 (4yr vest) that aligns my incentives with the long-term platform reliability outcomes I'll deliver. At a $15B IPO, this grant would still represent a fraction of the value I'm protecting."

**Lever 3 — Multi-Region Infrastructure Scope**
The $590M expansion requires building platform infrastructure across multiple regulatory jurisdictions — a massive scope expansion.
> "The $590M UK/Regional expansion means I'll be architecting platform infrastructure across AWS/GCP regions in Australia, UK, Singapore, and potentially other markets — each with different data sovereignty requirements, different regulatory expectations for infrastructure controls, and different disaster recovery mandates. This multi-region, multi-jurisdictional scope significantly exceeds a standard platform engineering role. I'm targeting A$262,000 base with A$300,000 in options."

**Lever 4 — Competing Offer Leverage — Triple Peer Set**
Use offers from all three peer sets to establish your floor.
> "I have a competing offer from [Google SRE/Stripe Production/JPMorgan Platform] at $X total compensation. I prefer Airwallex's mission — building the compliance-grade platform for cross-border payments — but the total compensation needs to be within 10% of my alternatives. Can we discuss increasing the options grant from A$200,000 to A$300,000 to close the gap?"

**Lever 5 — Incident Response & On-Call Premium (SIGNATURE ROLE Exclusive)**
Payment platform on-call carries regulatory consequences that standard on-call does not.
> "On-call for Airwallex's payment processing platform is fundamentally different from standard infrastructure on-call. A P0 incident doesn't just affect revenue — it can trigger mandatory regulatory reporting, customer notification requirements, and potential audit findings. This regulatory-grade on-call accountability justifies either explicit on-call compensation or a base adjustment to A$265,000 that accounts for this 24/7 regulatory accountability."

**Lever 6 — Platform Team Building Authority (SIGNATURE ROLE Exclusive)**
If you will build or lead a platform reliability team, negotiate for the scope and compensation of a team lead.
> "I understand this role will evolve to include building a Reliability Leads platform team as the $590M expansion progresses. I'd like to discuss a title trajectory to Staff/Principal Reliability Leads Platform Engineer within 12 months, with a compensation step-up to the L6/L7 band. My initial package should reflect the leadership trajectory: A$255,000 base with A$290,000 in options."

**Lever 7 — Compliance Certification & Continuous Learning (SIGNATURE ROLE Exclusive)**
The role requires staying current on both platform engineering and regulatory developments. Negotiate for investment in both.
> "This role requires continuous learning across two domains — platform engineering and financial regulation. I'd like a professional development budget that covers both: cloud certifications (AWS Solutions Architect Professional, GCP Professional Cloud Architect) AND compliance training (CAMS, regulatory workshops). This dual investment directly benefits Airwallex. Combined with A$258,000 base, this represents a competitive package."

**Lever 8 — Architecture Decision Authority (SIGNATURE ROLE Exclusive)**
Clarify and formalize your architectural decision-making authority. This affects both your impact and your future compensation.
> "I'd like to confirm that this role includes architectural decision authority over platform infrastructure choices that affect compliance posture — CI/CD pipeline design, observability stack selection, access management architecture, and disaster recovery topology. This architectural authority should be reflected in both the job description and the compensation. I'm targeting the Senior/Staff band at A$260,000 base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: This is the SIGNATURE ROLE — negotiate like it. Target the 85th-90th percentile across all components. For Melbourne, push for A$258,000+ base with A$290,000+ options (4yr vest) and a A$40,000 signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be A$218,000 base with A$180,000 options. In San Francisco, target $295,000 base / $370,000 options with a floor of $252,000 / $220,000. In London, target £168,000 / £185,000 options with a floor of £140,000 / £115,000. Never accept a first offer — always counter with the compliance infrastructure ownership narrative. Negotiate base, options, signing bonus, vesting schedule, refresh grants, on-call compensation, professional development budget, and title trajectory as separate line items. Request the options grant documentation in writing: number of shares, strike price, current 409A/FMV valuation, vesting schedule, and exercise window. If Airwallex resists on base, demand a A$40,000-$60,000 signing bonus, accelerated 3-year vesting, and a written commitment to annual refresh grants of A$80,000-$100,000 in additional options. Your walk-away power is absolute — this is the scarcest role at Airwallex, and they know it.
