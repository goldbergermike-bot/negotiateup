#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇦🇺 Melbourne (AUD) | A$140,000 – A$195,000 | A$60,000 – A$130,000 | A$200,000 – A$325,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Engineers at Airwallex handle uniquely sensitive and high-volume data — cross-border transaction records, KYC identity data, FX pricing data, and regulatory reporting outputs. Every data pipeline you build must satisfy data integrity requirements that regulators examine. The $8B valuation depends on the reliability and accuracy of data flowing through your pipelines. Push for compensation that reflects both the sensitivity of the data you handle and the regulatory consequences of pipeline failures.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Airwallex Level | Wise Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent | Nium Equivalent |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data Engineer (L4) | Data Engineer |
| Senior Data Eng. | Senior Data Eng. | Senior Data Eng. (L5) | Senior Data Eng. |

Stripe Data Engineers at L4/L5 earn $185K-$250K base in SF. Wise Data Engineers in London are £85K-£125K. Airwallex Data Engineer comp should match Wise with meaningful options premium. Financial data engineering commands a 10-15% premium over general data engineering due to compliance, audit, and data integrity requirements.

#### 🛡️ Airwallex Compliance Resilience & Reliability Leads Lever

The **Series G $8B valuation** depends on data integrity — accurate transaction records, reliable regulatory reports, and trustworthy analytics that drive business decisions. The **Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit** examined the data pipelines that produce regulatory reports, transaction monitoring data feeds, and KYC/AML data stores. Data quality issues in these pipelines can trigger regulatory findings.

As a Data Engineer, you are a **Reliability Lead** for Airwallex's data infrastructure. Your pipelines produce the regulatory reports that AUSTRAC examines. Your data warehouse powers the analytics that drive business decisions. The **$590M UK/Regional investment** requires extending data infrastructure to new markets — new data sources, new regulatory reporting requirements, and new data sovereignty constraints.

**How to leverage this in negotiation:**
- Your pipelines produce regulatory reports — data quality is a compliance requirement, not just a best practice
- The AUSTRAC audit examined data produced by pipelines you will own
- The $590M expansion requires new data pipelines for new markets with different reporting requirements
- Financial data engineers who understand regulatory reporting are scarce

> "The data pipelines I build at Airwallex will produce the regulatory reports that AUSTRAC and FCA examine. Data quality in these pipelines isn't just a best practice — it's a compliance requirement with direct regulatory consequences. The $590M expansion requires new data infrastructure across markets. I'm targeting A$188,000 base with A$118,000 in options."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Regulatory Data Pipeline Premium**
Data pipelines that produce regulatory reports carry higher quality and audit requirements than standard analytics pipelines.
> "Building data pipelines that produce regulatory reports for AUSTRAC and FCA is fundamentally different from standard analytics pipeline work. These pipelines have audit requirements for data lineage, quality, and completeness that standard data engineering doesn't require. I'm targeting A$190,000 base."

**Lever 2 — Data Sensitivity & Security Clearance**
You will handle PII, financial transaction data, and KYC identity data — extremely sensitive data categories.
> "I'll be handling some of the most sensitive data categories — financial transaction records, KYC identity data, and cross-border payment details. The security clearance, data handling protocols, and compliance training required for this data justify A$188,000 base."

**Lever 3 — Real-Time Streaming Expertise**
Cross-border payments require real-time data processing for transaction monitoring, FX pricing, and fraud detection.
> "Airwallex's platform requires real-time streaming infrastructure for transaction monitoring and FX pricing. My experience with [Kafka/Flink/Spark Streaming] in financial data environments is directly applicable. I'm targeting A$192,000 base."

**Lever 4 — Data Governance & Compliance Ownership**
If you will own data governance, lineage, or quality frameworks, this is infrastructure work that scales.
> "Owning data governance and lineage for regulatory pipelines means my work affects every compliance report Airwallex produces. This infrastructure-level impact justifies A$190,000 base with A$120,000 in options."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 80th percentile. For Melbourne, push for A$188,000+ base with A$118,000+ options (4yr vest). Your accept-at floor should be A$155,000 base with A$72,000 options. In San Francisco, target $220,000 base / $148,000 options with a floor of $185,000 / $90,000. In London, target £115,000 / £72,000 options with a floor of £92,000 / £42,000. Data Engineers should negotiate for explicit pipeline ownership (regulatory reporting, transaction monitoring, or analytics), cloud certification budget, and a performance review at 6 months tied to pipeline reliability metrics. If base is capped, push for A$15,000-$25,000 signing bonus.
