At the $8B valuation, every enterprise integration you architect has measurable revenue impact. The AUSTRAC audit success also validates the compliance architecture patterns you will extend to new client integrations. Push for top-of-band base plus enhanced options by anchoring to the revenue impact of your work.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Airwallex Level | Wise Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent | Nium Equivalent |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Solutions Architect | Solutions Engineer | Solutions Architect (L5) | Solutions Architect |
| Senior SA | Senior SE | Senior SA (L6) | Senior SA |

Stripe Solutions Architects at L5/L6 earn $210K-$280K base in SF. Wise Solutions Engineers in London are £95K-£140K. Airwallex SA comp should match Wise bands with substantial options premium. The role's direct revenue impact (client onboarding velocity, integration quality) justifies pushing toward Stripe L5 base levels.

#### 🛡️ Airwallex Compliance Resilience & Reliability Leads Lever

The **Series G $8B valuation** is driven by enterprise client adoption — and Solutions Architects are the critical path for every enterprise onboarding. The **Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit** examined the compliance controls embedded in client-facing integrations — KYC data flows, transaction reporting, and API security patterns that you design.

As a Solutions Architect, you are a **Reliability Lead** for the client integration layer. Your architectural decisions determine whether enterprise integrations satisfy compliance requirements across AUSTRAC, FCA, and MAS. The **$590M UK/Regional investment** means new enterprise clients in new markets, each requiring bespoke integration architectures that satisfy local regulatory requirements.

**How to leverage this in negotiation:**
- Your integrations are the revenue engine — every enterprise client you onboard drives recurring revenue
- Client-facing compliance architecture is directly auditable — your designs must withstand regulatory scrutiny
- The $590M expansion creates new enterprise sales corridors that need SA support for onboarding
- Solutions Architects who understand both technical integration and financial compliance are extremely rare

> "Every enterprise integration I design at Airwallex must satisfy both client technical requirements and multi-jurisdictional compliance mandates — AUSTRAC, FCA, and MAS. The $590M UK expansion will bring new enterprise clients who need compliant integration architectures. I'm targeting A$205,000 base with A$135,000 in options."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Revenue Attribution**
Solutions Architects directly influence enterprise deal velocity and client retention. Quantify this impact.
> "In my current role, I've architected integrations for X enterprise clients generating $Y in annual revenue. At Airwallex, my integration speed and quality will directly impact enterprise deal closure. I'm targeting A$208,000 base to reflect this revenue impact."

**Lever 2 — Compliance-Aware Integration Design**
Integration architectures for regulated financial products require specialized knowledge.
> "Designing integrations that satisfy both enterprise client requirements and multi-jurisdictional financial regulations is a specialized skill. My experience with [PCI-DSS/SOC 2/financial API compliance] at [current company] is directly applicable. I'm targeting A$210,000 base."

**Lever 3 — Pre-Sales Technical Influence**
If the role includes pre-sales support, your work directly drives revenue. Negotiate accordingly.
> "If this role includes pre-sales technical support, my influence on deal closure warrants compensation alignment with quota-carrying roles. I'd like to discuss either a A$210,000 base or a base-plus-bonus structure tied to enterprise client onboarding targets."

**Lever 4 — API & Developer Experience Ownership**
If you will own or shape Airwallex's developer experience and API documentation, this is platform leverage.
> "Owning the developer experience and API integration patterns means my work scales across every enterprise integration. This platform-level impact justifies A$205,000 base with A$140,000 in options."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 80th percentile. For Melbourne, push for A$205,000+ base with A$135,000+ options (4yr vest). Your accept-at floor should be A$175,000 base with A$85,000 options. In San Francisco, target $245,000 base / $165,000 options with a floor of $210,000 / $105,000. In London, target £128,000 / £82,000 options with a floor of £105,000 / £52,000. Solutions Architects should negotiate for explicit client portfolio ownership and request a performance bonus tied to enterprise onboarding metrics. If base is capped, push for a A$20,000 signing bonus and a written 12-month review path to Senior SA.
