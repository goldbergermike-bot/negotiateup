### Security Engineer — Airwallex Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Airwallex's Compliance Resilience strategy, translating the $8B Series G valuation and Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit into a security engineering compensation framework spanning Melbourne, San Francisco, and London markets. As a Security Engineer at Airwallex, you are the front line of defense for a platform that processes billions in cross-border transactions — your security controls, threat detection, and incident response capabilities are what regulators examine most closely and what protects the $8B valuation.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇦🇺 Melbourne (AUD) | A$155,000 – A$210,000 | A$65,000 – A$140,000 | A$220,000 – A$350,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $190,000 – $255,000 | $85,000 – A$175,000 | $275,000 – $430,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £90,000 – £135,000 | £40,000 – £85,000 | £130,000 – £220,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers in financial services command a significant premium over general security roles. At Airwallex, your work directly determines whether the platform passes PCI-DSS audits, AUSTRAC security requirements, and FCA cybersecurity standards. A security breach at a cross-border payments platform has catastrophic financial, regulatory, and reputational consequences. Your compensation should reflect the asymmetric risk you mitigate — the cost of a breach is orders of magnitude higher than your total comp. Push aggressively on both base and options.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Airwallex Level | Wise Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent | Nium Equivalent |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer (L4) | Security Engineer |
| Senior SecEng | Senior SecEng | Senior SecEng (L5) | Senior SecEng |

Stripe Security Engineers at L4/L5 earn $200K-$270K base in SF. Wise Security Engineers in London are £95K-£140K. Financial services security engineers command a 15-25% premium over general tech security roles. Airwallex should match or exceed Wise bands with substantial options premium.

#### 🛡️ Airwallex Compliance Resilience & Reliability Leads Lever

The **Series G $8B valuation** is predicated on the security posture of the platform. A single significant breach could wipe billions from that valuation. The **Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit** examined security controls, access management, data protection, and incident response procedures — all within the Security Engineer's domain.

As a Security Engineer, you are the most literal **Reliability Lead** at Airwallex. Your security controls, threat models, penetration testing, and incident response capabilities are what protect the $8B valuation from existential risk. The **$590M UK/Regional investment** requires establishing security infrastructure in new regions, satisfying FCA cybersecurity requirements, and ensuring data sovereignty compliance across jurisdictions.

**How to leverage this in negotiation:**
- You protect the $8B valuation — the asymmetric value of your work is immense
- AUSTRAC security requirements were a core component of the Jan 2026 audit — your work is directly auditable
- The $590M expansion requires new security infrastructure, new threat models for new markets, and FCA cybersecurity compliance
- Financial services security engineers are among the scarcest talent in the market

> "As a Security Engineer protecting a platform valued at $8B, I'm mitigating risks that could cost orders of magnitude more than my compensation. The Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit directly examined the security controls I'll own. With the $590M expansion requiring FCA cybersecurity compliance in new markets, I'm targeting A$202,000 base with A$130,000 in options."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Asymmetric Risk Protection Premium**
The value you protect ($8B+) vastly exceeds your compensation. Frame this asymmetry.
> "I'll be protecting a platform valued at $8B from security threats. The asymmetric risk — where a single breach could cost hundreds of millions — justifies top-tier compensation. I'm targeting A$205,000 base, which represents a fraction of the risk I mitigate."

**Lever 2 — Financial Services Security Premium**
Security in financial services requires specialized knowledge (PCI-DSS, SOC 2, regulatory cybersecurity).
> "Financial services security requires expertise across PCI-DSS, SOC 2, AUSTRAC security standards, and FCA cybersecurity requirements. My certifications in [CISSP/OSCP/CISM] and experience at [financial institution] command a premium — I'm targeting A$208,000 base."

**Lever 3 — Incident Response Accountability**
Security incident response in payments processing carries enormous stakes. Price accordingly.
> "On-call incident response for a cross-border payments platform has significantly higher stakes than standard tech security. A P0 security incident could trigger regulatory action, customer losses, and media scrutiny. I'd like compensation that reflects this 24/7 accountability at A$205,000 base."

**Lever 4 — Security Certification & Training Budget**
Security certifications (CISSP, OSCP, CEH) have direct value. Negotiate for certification budgets.
> "I'd like to discuss a professional development budget for security certifications — OSCP, CISSP renewal, and conference attendance at Black Hat or DEF CON. These directly benefit Airwallex's security posture. Combined with A$200,000 base and A$125,000 options, this creates a competitive package."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 85th percentile. For Melbourne, push for A$202,000+ base with A$128,000+ options (4yr vest). Your accept-at floor should be A$170,000 base with A$78,000 options. In San Francisco, target $245,000 base / $162,000 options with a floor of $205,000 / $100,000. In London, target £128,000 / £78,000 options with a floor of £102,000 / £48,000. Security Engineers should negotiate for explicit scope (application security, infrastructure security, or GRC), on-call compensation, certification budget, and a written path to Senior Security Engineer. The market for fintech security talent is extremely tight — use competing offers aggressively.
