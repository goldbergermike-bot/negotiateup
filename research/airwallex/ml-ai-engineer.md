### ML/AI Engineer — Airwallex Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Airwallex's Compliance Resilience strategy, translating the $8B Series G valuation and Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit into an ML/AI engineering compensation framework spanning Melbourne, San Francisco, and London markets. As an ML/AI Engineer at Airwallex, you build the machine learning systems that power fraud detection, transaction monitoring, FX optimization, risk scoring, and intelligent automation across the cross-border payments platform — your models are the intelligence layer that makes compliance scalable and revenue optimizable.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇦🇺 Melbourne (AUD) | A$155,000 – A$215,000 | A$70,000 – A$160,000 | A$225,000 – A$375,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $195,000 – $265,000 | $90,000 – $200,000 | $285,000 – $465,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £95,000 – £135,000 | £45,000 – £95,000 | £140,000 – £230,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers are among the most competitive talent markets globally, and Airwallex competes not just with fintech peers but with Big Tech (Google, Meta, Amazon) for this talent. Your leverage is significant. At Airwallex, your models have direct regulatory impact — fraud detection accuracy, transaction monitoring sensitivity, and risk scoring calibration are all subjects of regulatory examination. The $8B valuation reflects the platform's intelligent capabilities that you will build and extend. Push aggressively on both base (market rate for ML talent) and options (pre-IPO value creation).

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Airwallex Level | Wise Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent | Nium Equivalent |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| ML/AI Engineer | ML Engineer | ML Engineer (L4) | ML Engineer |
| Senior ML/AI Eng. | Senior ML Eng. | Senior ML Eng. (L5) | Senior ML Eng. |

Stripe ML Engineers at L4/L5 earn $210K-$300K base in SF with large RSU packages. Google and Meta ML engineers at equivalent levels earn $230K-$350K base. Wise ML Engineers in London are £100K-£145K. Airwallex must compete with Big Tech offers — use FAANG offers as your ceiling anchor. The pre-IPO options should bridge any base gap.

#### 🛡️ Airwallex Compliance Resilience & Reliability Leads Lever

The **Series G $8B valuation** is partly a bet on Airwallex's AI capabilities — the ability to scale compliance operations through intelligent automation rather than linear headcount growth. The **Jan 2026 AUSTRAC audit** directly examined the performance of ML-powered transaction monitoring and fraud detection systems. Model accuracy, false positive rates, and detection thresholds were all subject to regulatory scrutiny.

As an ML/AI Engineer, you are a **Reliability Lead** for Airwallex's intelligent systems. Your models determine whether suspicious transactions are flagged, whether fraud is detected, and whether compliance operations can scale efficiently. The **$590M UK/Regional investment** depends on scaling ML systems to new markets — different fraud patterns, different regulatory thresholds, different risk profiles that require model adaptation and retraining.

**How to leverage this in negotiation:**
- Your models are directly examined during regulatory audits — model performance is a compliance metric
- The AUSTRAC audit validated ML-powered compliance systems — you are extending this to new markets
- The $590M expansion requires adapting models to new markets with different risk profiles
- ML/AI talent with financial crime and compliance domain expertise is extremely rare — most ML engineers work on ads or recommendations

> "ML models for financial crime detection and regulatory compliance are fundamentally different from recommendation systems or ad optimization. My models will be directly examined during regulatory audits like the Jan 2026 AUSTRAC review, where detection rates and false positive ratios are compliance metrics. The $590M expansion requires scaling these models globally. I'm targeting A$208,000 base with A$148,000 in options."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Big Tech Competing Offers**
ML/AI Engineers have the strongest competing offer leverage. Use FAANG offers to set the ceiling.
> "I have a competing offer from [Google/Meta/Amazon] at $X total comp. I prefer Airwallex's mission and the impact of building compliance-critical ML systems, but I need the total compensation to be within 15% of the competing offer. Can we close the gap through additional options?"

**Lever 2 — Regulatory ML Specialization Premium**
ML for financial crime detection and compliance is a specialized domain that commands premium compensation.
> "ML for financial crime detection requires domain expertise that takes years to develop — understanding AML patterns, calibrating detection thresholds for regulatory requirements, and building explainable models that auditors can evaluate. I'm targeting A$212,000 base to reflect this specialization."

**Lever 3 — Model Ownership & Impact Attribution**
If your models directly impact revenue (FX optimization) or prevent losses (fraud detection), quantify this.
> "My fraud detection model at [current company] prevented $X million in annual losses with a Y% detection rate. At Airwallex's transaction volume, similar model performance would have proportionally larger impact. I'm targeting A$210,000 base."

**Lever 4 — Research & Publication Rights**
ML/AI Engineers value the ability to publish and attend top conferences. Negotiate for this.
> "I'd like to discuss publication rights for non-proprietary ML research and a conference budget covering NeurIPS, ICML, or KDD. This benefits Airwallex's employer brand in the ML talent market and my professional development. Combined with A$205,000 base and A$145,000 options, this creates a competitive package."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 85th percentile. For Melbourne, push for A$208,000+ base with A$148,000+ options (4yr vest). Your accept-at floor should be A$172,000 base with A$85,000 options. In San Francisco, target $255,000 base / $185,000 options with a floor of $210,000 / $108,000. In London, target £130,000 / £88,000 options with a floor of £105,000 / £52,000. ML/AI Engineers have the strongest competing offer leverage of any role — always have a Big Tech offer or credible alternative before negotiating. Push for GPU/compute budget, conference budget, and publication rights as non-comp benefits. If base is capped, demand A$30,000-$50,000 signing bonus and accelerated 3-year vesting.
