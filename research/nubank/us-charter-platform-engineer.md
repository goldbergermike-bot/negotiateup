#### Negotiation DNA

The US Charter Platform Engineer is Nubank's **SIGNATURE ROLE** -- the single most strategically important engineering position created in the company's 13-year history. This role exists because of a specific event: on January 29, 2026, Nubank received US National Bank Charter approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, unlocking the $23 trillion US consumer banking market for the world's largest digital bank. The US Charter Platform Engineer is the founding technical pioneer who will architect, build, and scale the US banking infrastructure that transforms Nubank from a LatAm powerhouse into a truly global financial institution.

This role carries a 25-35% premium over standard Staff/Principal engineering compensation because it represents the rarest intersection of skills in modern fintech: US banking systems expertise, distributed systems architecture at 100M+ customer scale, cross-border platform engineering across four regulatory jurisdictions, and regulatory engineering fluency with OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve requirements. The $783M quarterly profit and 30%+ ROE provide the financial foundation -- this is not a startup asking engineers to take on risk; it is the most profitable digital bank in Latin America asking a founding engineer to extend proven success into the world's largest market.

CEO David Velez -- Colombian-born, Stanford MBA -- built Nubank from a single credit card in a Sao Paulo apartment to 100M+ customers across three countries. The US Charter Platform Engineer writes the next chapter of that story: bringing Nubank's proven digital banking model to the United States with full regulatory authority, NYSE-listed equity, and the backing of an organization that has already proven it can build, scale, and profit from digital banking at continental scale. Candidates who fill this role will be recognized as the architect of Nubank's most consequential market expansion, with equity upside tied directly to the US revenue trajectory of a company that already generates $783M in quarterly profit.

#### Level Mapping

| Nubank Level | Revolut Equivalent | Monzo Equivalent | Chime Equivalent | SoFi Equivalent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| US Charter Platform Eng | Staff/Principal Engineer | Staff/Principal Engineer | Principal Engineer | Principal Engineer |
| (Signature Role) | (No direct equivalent -- this role has expansion mandate premium) | (No direct equivalent) | (No direct equivalent) | (No direct equivalent) |

This role maps to Staff-to-Principal IC levels at peer fintechs, with an additional 25-35% compensation premium for the expansion mandate and regulatory complexity. The closest comparisons are Staff Platform Engineers at Stripe building new financial products, founding engineers at well-funded US neobanks (Chime, SoFi, Current) who built banking platforms from scratch, and VP-level engineering leaders at JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs who own regulated banking infrastructure. No single peer role captures the full scope -- this is a hybrid of founding-team equity opportunity, Staff+ technical scope, and regulated-banking infrastructure accountability.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

This section is the core of the SIGNATURE ROLE negotiation strategy. The US Charter is not a background detail -- it is the reason this role exists, the reason it commands the highest IC compensation at Nubank, and the reason candidates should negotiate aggressively for enhanced equity.

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). This is the defining moment for the US Charter Platform Engineer role. The charter authorizes Nubank to offer FDIC-insured deposit accounts, consumer lending products, payment services, and investment products directly to US consumers. Every dollar of US revenue will flow through systems designed and built by this role. The $783M quarterly profit means this expansion is backed by proven profitability -- this is not speculative market entry; it is the most profitable digital bank in Latin America extending its proven model into the world's largest banking market.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure — Maximum Founding US Team Premium:** The US Charter Platform Engineer should negotiate for 2x the standard RSU grant as a baseline, with strong candidates pushing to 2.5x. This means total equity packages of $640K-$1,280K+ over four years, translating to $160K-$320K+ in annual equity value. This is the highest equity band at Nubank because the role has the highest direct impact on US revenue generation. Frame this as: "I am the architect of Nubank's US banking platform. Every US product, every US transaction, every US dollar of revenue runs on the infrastructure I build. My equity should reflect founding-architect-level contribution to a business line that could add tens of billions to Nubank's market cap." The $783M quarterly profit means this is not speculative equity -- it is enhanced equity at a profitable company, backed by NYSE: NU liquidity and real earnings from 100M+ customers.

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit as Risk Mitigation:** The $783M quarterly profit and 30%+ ROE are the strongest stability floor of any company offering "founding team" equity premiums in 2026. Nubank is not a Series B startup with 18 months of runway -- it is a profitable, NYSE-listed company with 100M+ customers and proven unit economics across three countries. The risk profile of Founding US Team equity at Nubank is fundamentally different from founding-team equity at pre-revenue neobanks. The enhanced RSU grants carry the upside of founding-team contribution with the downside protection of a profitable, publicly traded company. This risk-reward asymmetry is the single strongest argument for accepting a 2x-2.5x equity premium: the upside is genuinely outsized (US market cap expansion), and the downside is protected by $783M in quarterly profit.

- **Negotiation Script — SIGNATURE ROLE Version:** "I want to be direct about what this role represents. The US Charter Platform Engineer is Nubank's signature engineering role -- the architect of the entire US banking platform following the January 29th charter approval. I would be building the infrastructure that every US product runs on, every US transaction flows through, and every US dollar of revenue depends on. Nubank generates $783M in quarterly profit, so this is not startup risk -- it is profitable expansion into the world's largest banking market. I am looking for compensation that reflects the founding-architect nature of this role: a base of $320K-$365K, an RSU package of $640K-$1,280K over four years representing a 2x-2.5x Founding US Team premium, and a bonus target of 20%+. No other company in the world is offering the combination of 100M-customer proven scale, greenfield US charter platform build, NYSE liquidity, and $783M quarterly profit. The compensation should match this unique opportunity."

#### Global Levers

1. **Signature Role Maximum Equity Premium (New York):** "This is Nubank's signature engineering role -- the architect of the US banking platform following the January 29, 2026 charter approval. The role commands a 25-35% premium over standard Staff/Principal compensation because it has no precedent in Nubank's history and no direct peer in the market. I would like a base of $320K-$365K and an RSU package of $640K-$1,280K over four years, representing a 2x-2.5x Founding US Team premium. The $783M quarterly profit means this equity is backed by real earnings, not speculation. Any offer below $450K total comp fails to recognize the signature nature of this role."

2. **Once-in-a-Career Platform Creation:** "Building a US-regulated banking platform from scratch for the world's largest digital bank is a once-in-a-career opportunity -- for both me and Nubank. This is not something that happens twice. The compensation should reflect the irreplaceable nature of this window. I am targeting $340K base, $200K+ annual RSU value, and a 22%+ bonus to align with the magnitude of the mandate. The $783M quarterly profit proves Nubank can afford to invest in its most strategically important hire."

3. **Dual-Currency Structure at Maximum Premium (Sao Paulo):** "For a Sao Paulo-based SIGNATURE ROLE with this level of strategic impact, I would like to structure the majority of my compensation in USD to align with Nubank's NYSE listing, USD-denominated earnings, and the US market focus of this role. A USD-pegged base of R$600K-R$900K ($120K-$180K) with USD-denominated RSUs protects against BRL volatility and reflects that this role exists to build US-market infrastructure generating USD revenue. The $783M quarterly profit in USD makes this a natural alignment."

4. **Platform-to-Revenue Direct Attribution:** "Every dollar of Nubank's US revenue will flow through the platform I build. This direct revenue attribution is unusual for an IC role -- it is typically reserved for business leaders. I would like the compensation structure to reflect this: $340K+ base, $200K+ annual RSU value with performance-based refresh grants tied to US launch milestones, and a 22%+ bonus with US revenue metrics as multipliers. The $783M quarterly profit demonstrates that Nubank rewards platform excellence with real financial returns."

#### Extended SIGNATURE ROLE Analysis — Why This Role Commands Maximum Compensation

**The Talent Scarcity Problem:**
The Venn diagram of engineers who possess all four required capabilities is vanishingly small. The US Charter Platform Engineer must have: (a) experience building banking platforms at 100M+ customer scale, (b) deep US banking regulatory knowledge including OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve requirements, (c) cross-border platform architecture experience spanning multiple regulatory jurisdictions, and (d) the ability to operate effectively in Nubank's LatAm-rooted engineering culture while building a US-market product. Fewer than 200 engineers globally meet all four criteria. This extreme scarcity is the fundamental driver of the 25-35% premium over standard Staff/Principal compensation.

**The Market Cap Multiplier:**
If Nubank's US operations add even 10-15% to the company's $60B+ market cap over the next 3-5 years, that represents $6B-$9B in value creation. The US Charter Platform Engineer is the single IC most directly responsible for enabling this value creation. RSU grants to this engineer carry asymmetric upside because the US revenue they enable will be reflected in NYSE: NU stock price, and the $783M quarterly profit provides a stability floor beneath the equity value.

**The Regulatory Accountability Premium:**
Unlike most engineering roles where code quality affects user experience, the US Charter Platform Engineer's architectural decisions will be scrutinized by OCC examiners, FDIC auditors, and Federal Reserve supervisors. Platform deficiencies that would be bugs at a tech company become regulatory findings at a national bank -- potentially resulting in consent orders, fines, or charter revocation. This regulatory accountability justifies a compensation premium comparable to VP-level engineering leaders at traditional banks who carry similar examination risk.

**The Founding-Team Compression:**
At an established company, achieving the influence this role carries -- setting technical direction for an entire geographic market, defining architectural standards, hiring and mentoring the US engineering team -- typically requires 5-10 years of internal career progression to reach VP or Distinguished Engineer. The US Charter compresses this timeline to day one. The compensation should reflect the compressed timeline-to-impact: founding-level equity at day one, not a standard vesting schedule that assumes incremental contribution growth.

#### Detailed Platform Responsibilities — What This Engineer Builds

**US Banking Core Platform:**
The US Charter Platform Engineer designs the end-to-end US banking platform -- core banking ledger with double-entry accounting, deposit account systems compliant with FDIC insurance requirements, lending engines meeting TILA/ECOA/RESPA disclosure requirements, and customer data platforms that satisfy both OCC examination standards and privacy regulations. These are the highest-impact system design decisions at Nubank, and they must be correct from day one because regulatory requirements do not accommodate iterative rollback.

**US Payment Rail Integration:**
Architecting Nubank's connections to every major US payment network -- ACH (NACHA rules), Fedwire (Federal Reserve), RTP (The Clearing House), FedNow (Federal Reserve real-time), card networks (Visa, Mastercard), and emerging payment systems. Each integration requires deep understanding of message formats, settlement mechanics, error handling, reversals, and regulatory requirements. The platform must handle these integrations at the scale Nubank has demonstrated in LatAm -- billions of transactions annually -- while maintaining the sub-second latency that US consumers expect.

**Cross-Border Platform Engineering:**
Building the platform layer that enables Nubank to operate as a unified global financial institution while maintaining strict regulatory isolation between jurisdictions. This includes cross-border money movement architecture, multi-currency accounting systems, jurisdiction-specific data governance with data residency enforcement, and regulatory reporting across Brazilian Central Bank, Mexican CNBV, Colombian SFC, and US OCC/Federal Reserve frameworks. This is one of the most architecturally complex challenges in global fintech -- very few engineers have designed systems that operate under four different regulatory regimes simultaneously.

**Regulatory Engineering as a First-Class Discipline:**
Unlike most engineering roles where compliance is a constraint, the US Charter Platform Engineer treats regulatory engineering as a core platform capability. This means building systems with auditable decision trails visible to OCC examiners, automated regulatory reporting (Call Reports, BSA/AML filings, HMDA data), real-time compliance monitoring with alert escalation, and examination-ready documentation as first-class features. The $783M quarterly profit is partly attributable to Nubank's sophisticated approach to regulatory compliance in LatAm -- this role extends that discipline into the US regulatory framework.

#### Region-Specific Negotiation Strategies

**New York (US Expansion HQ) — Primary Target:**
New York is the primary location for this SIGNATURE ROLE because proximity to US regulators, US payment network partners, and the US financial ecosystem is critical. Target total comp of $480K-$555K by anchoring on the maximum RSU premium and a base of $320K+. The negotiation anchor is: "This is the highest-impact IC role at a $60B+ company entering the world's largest banking market. The $783M quarterly profit proves Nubank can afford to compensate its most strategic hire at the level this role demands."

**Sao Paulo (Global HQ) — Cross-Border Variant:**
For candidates based in Sao Paulo, negotiate aggressively for USD-denominated components. Target R$3,500K-R$4,355K ($700K-$871K) total comp with a significant USD-pegged portion. The cross-border variant of this role involves closer coordination with existing LatAm teams while building US infrastructure remotely, which may justify even higher equity to compensate for the timezone and coordination challenges.

**Berlin — EU Variant:**
For Berlin-based candidates, target EUR750K-EUR904K ($816K-$984K) total comp. The EU variant benefits from GDPR expertise that maps to US data privacy requirements and European work-life balance that attracts candidates who might otherwise go to US-based companies. Leverage EU fintech scarcity aggressively -- very few engineers in Europe have the US banking platform experience this role requires.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** This is the SIGNATURE ROLE at Nubank -- the highest-compensation IC position created for the US Charter expansion. In New York, target $480K-$555K total comp by securing maximum Founding US Team equity ($640K-$1,280K RSU/4yr at 2x-2.5x standard grant) and anchoring base at $320K+. The $783M quarterly profit, the 100M+ customer proven scale, the NYSE: NU liquidity, and the once-in-a-generation US charter platform build justify the highest IC compensation Nubank has ever offered. In Sao Paulo, target R$3,500K-R$4,355K ($700K-$871K) with maximum USD-denominated components. In Berlin, target EUR750K-EUR904K ($816K-$984K). No other company in the world offers this combination of proven scale, greenfield US charter build, profitable financial backing, and public equity liquidity. The compensation must match the opportunity. If Nubank's offer falls below $450K total comp for the New York role, the company is fundamentally mispricing its most strategic engineering hire, and the candidate should communicate this directly: "This is your signature role. The compensation should reflect that, backed by $783M in quarterly profit."
