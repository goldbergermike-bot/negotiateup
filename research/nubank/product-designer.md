#### Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at Nubank craft the user experience of the world's largest digital bank, serving over 100 million customers who interact with Nubank's app as their primary financial interface. Nubank's design philosophy -- radical simplicity in complex financial contexts -- has been central to its growth from a single credit card product to a comprehensive financial platform generating $783M in quarterly profit. Designers work across research, interaction design, visual design, prototyping, and design systems, all within the high-stakes domain of consumer finance where a confusing flow can mean regulatory violations or customer financial harm.

The January 29, 2026 US National Bank Charter creates a new design frontier -- adapting Nubank's award-winning LatAm UX for US consumers who have different financial mental models, accessibility requirements (ADA, WCAG), and regulatory disclosure expectations. Product Designers joining the Founding US Team will design the first US banking experience from scratch, making design decisions that directly determine customer acquisition and market perception. CEO David Velez built Nubank around the principle that financial services should be simple and human -- Founding US Team designers are bringing that vision to the world's largest banking market.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter. For Product Designers, this charter opens the challenge of bringing Nubank's design excellence -- built for 100M+ LatAm users -- to the US market, where consumer expectations, regulatory disclosures, and accessibility standards differ significantly. Designers are founding members of the US experience, not incremental hires.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure:** Founding US Team Product Designers should negotiate for 1.5-2x the standard RSU grant, pushing total equity from $80K-$180K to $120K-$270K over four years. The US launch UX will define market perception and directly impact customer acquisition -- the designer who creates this experience has outsized impact on Nubank's US trajectory. Frame this as: "I am designing Nubank's first impression on the US market. The equity should reflect the strategic importance of launch UX."

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit:** Nubank's $783M quarterly profit means the US design mandate is backed by proven financial performance, not startup hopes. NYSE: NU stock has tangible, immediate value backed by real earnings from 100M+ customers. The Founding US Team RSU premium carries materially lower risk than comparable equity at pre-revenue neobanks.

- **Negotiation Script:** "I am excited about designing Nubank's US banking experience following the January 29th charter approval. As a Founding US Team designer, I would be creating the end-to-end UX for Nubank's US products -- the first impression for an entirely new market. Given the $783M quarterly profit and the strategic importance of launch design to customer acquisition, I would like an enhanced RSU package of $120K-$270K over four years, reflecting the 1.5-2x Founding US Team premium."

#### Global Levers

1. **US Launch UX Pioneer (New York):** "I will be designing Nubank's first US banking experience -- this is the most visible design work in the company right now. The US launch UX will define market perception and directly impact customer acquisition. I would like a base of $140K+ and Founding US Team equity of $120K-$270K over four years, backed by Nubank's $783M quarterly profit."

2. **Regulated Design Expertise:** "Designing consumer financial products that are simultaneously intuitive and compliant with US disclosure regulations (Reg E, Reg Z, TILA) and accessibility standards (ADA, WCAG 2.1 AA) requires specialized expertise. I would like a 10-15% premium over the midpoint, reflecting this rare skill intersection."

3. **Dual-Currency Protection (Sao Paulo):** "I would like to structure a portion of my compensation in USD to align with Nubank's NYSE listing. A USD-pegged component protects against BRL volatility and reflects that my design work will drive US-market customer acquisition, backed by $783M in quarterly profit."

4. **Cross-Market Design System Value:** "Extending Nubank's design system from LatAm to US markets creates lasting infrastructure value -- US-specific patterns for SSN input, dollar-denominated displays, English-first typography, and ADA-compliant components. This systems-level design work has multi-year organizational impact and should be reflected in equity of $45K+ annually."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In New York, target $190K-$225K total comp by securing Founding US Team equity ($120K-$270K RSU/4yr) and anchoring base at $135K+. The $783M quarterly profit and US launch UX ownership justify above-band compensation. In Sao Paulo, target R$1,150K-R$1,445K ($230K-$289K) with USD-denominated components. In Berlin, target EUR250K-EUR300K ($272K-$326K) by leveraging EU fintech design talent scarcity. Frame every conversation around the strategic importance of launch design: "The UX I create is Nubank's first impression on the US market."
