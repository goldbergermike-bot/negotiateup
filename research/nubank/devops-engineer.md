#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at Nubank build and operate the cloud infrastructure that powers the world's largest digital bank -- a platform serving 100 million customers with sub-second latency requirements for financial transactions contributing to $783M in quarterly profit. Nubank's infrastructure runs primarily on AWS with extensive use of Kubernetes, Kafka, and a sophisticated CI/CD pipeline that enables thousands of deployments per week across hundreds of microservices. The January 29, 2026 US National Bank Charter introduces new infrastructure challenges: US data residency requirements, multi-region disaster recovery mandated by OCC and FDIC, and infrastructure audit controls that must satisfy federal bank examiners.

DevOps Engineers joining the Founding US Team will build the US infrastructure footprint from scratch -- greenfield cloud architecture in a regulated banking environment, with the financial backing of $783M in quarterly profit and a 30%+ ROE. This is not speculative infrastructure work at a startup hoping to reach scale; it is building regulated cloud infrastructure for a proven, profitable fintech entering the world's largest banking market. CEO David Velez built Nubank's LatAm infrastructure to serve 100M+ customers, and Founding US Team DevOps engineers are extending that infrastructure into US-regulated territory.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter. For DevOps Engineers, this charter creates the most demanding infrastructure mandate in Nubank's history -- building a US-compliant, multi-region banking infrastructure that meets the stringent requirements of OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve regulators, all backed by $783M in quarterly profit from the existing LatAm operation.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure:** Founding US Team DevOps Engineers should negotiate for 1.5-2x the standard RSU grant, pushing total equity from $100K-$210K to $150K-$315K over four years. The US infrastructure is foundational -- every US product, every US transaction, every US regulatory report runs on the infrastructure these engineers build. Frame this as: "I am building the infrastructure foundation for all of Nubank's US revenue. The equity should reflect this foundational-layer contribution."

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit:** Nubank's $783M quarterly profit means the US infrastructure buildout is backed by proven profitability, not venture funding. The enhanced RSU grants carry tangible, earnings-backed value on NYSE: NU. DevOps engineers at pre-revenue fintechs take on infrastructure risk with speculative equity; Founding US Team DevOps engineers get enhanced equity backed by real earnings from 100M+ customers.

- **Negotiation Script:** "I am excited about building Nubank's US infrastructure from scratch following the January 29th charter approval. As a DevOps Engineer on the Founding US Team, I would be designing the cloud architecture that all US banking operations run on -- data residency, multi-region DR, OCC-compliant audit logging. Given the $783M quarterly profit and the foundational nature of this infrastructure work, I would like an enhanced RSU package of $150K-$315K over four years, reflecting the 1.5-2x Founding US Team premium."

#### Global Levers

1. **US Banking Infrastructure Pioneer (New York):** "I will be building Nubank's US cloud infrastructure from the ground up -- data residency, multi-region disaster recovery, OCC-compliant audit logging. This is the most critical infrastructure work at the company right now. I would like a base of $155K+ and Founding US Team equity of $150K-$315K over four years, backed by Nubank's $783M quarterly profit."

2. **Regulated Infrastructure Expertise:** "Building infrastructure that satisfies US federal banking examiners requires specialized knowledge of SOX controls, OCC audit requirements, and FFIEC cybersecurity standards. My experience in regulated infrastructure commands a 10-15% premium over standard DevOps roles, targeting $160K+ base."

3. **Dual-Currency Protection (Sao Paulo):** "I would like to structure a portion of my compensation in USD to align with Nubank's NYSE listing. A USD-pegged component protects against BRL volatility and reflects that the US infrastructure I build will enable USD-denominated revenue backed by $783M in quarterly profit."

4. **Scale Plus Compliance Dual Challenge:** "Nubank's infrastructure serves 100M+ customers -- that is top-tier reliability engineering. Layer on US banking regulatory requirements, and this becomes one of the most complex infrastructure challenges in fintech. Compensation should reflect both dimensions -- I am targeting $50K+ annual RSU value and a 15%+ bonus target."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In New York, target $215K-$252K total comp by securing Founding US Team equity ($150K-$315K RSU/4yr) and anchoring base at $150K+. The $783M quarterly profit and the greenfield US infrastructure mandate justify above-band compensation. In Sao Paulo, target R$1,350K-R$1,670K ($270K-$334K) with USD-denominated components. In Berlin, target EUR280K-EUR346K ($305K-$376K) by leveraging EU infrastructure engineer scarcity and the regulated banking premium. Frame every conversation around infrastructure-as-foundation: "Every dollar of US revenue runs on the infrastructure I build."
