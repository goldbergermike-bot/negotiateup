#### Negotiation DNA

Product Managers at Nubank define the product vision and roadmap for financial products used by over 100 million customers -- credit cards, personal loans, insurance, investments, and digital accounts spanning Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. Nubank PMs are deeply analytical, leveraging proprietary data from one of the world's largest financial datasets to make product decisions that directly impact hundreds of millions in revenue. The January 29, 2026 US National Bank Charter opens an entirely new product frontier: designing digital banking products for the US market from scratch, informed by Nubank's decade of LatAm consumer fintech innovation and backed by $783M in quarterly profit.

This is a rare opportunity to build regulated financial products for the US market with the creative freedom of a greenfield launch and the backing of a profitable, NYSE-listed platform. Product Managers joining the Founding US Team will determine which products to launch first, how to differentiate against US incumbents (Chase, Bank of America) and neobank competitors (Chime, SoFi, Current), and how to adapt Nubank's award-winning LatAm product innovations for US consumer expectations. CEO David Velez built the largest digital bank in Latin America starting with a single credit card -- PMs on the Founding US Team are defining the US product portfolio from that same 0-to-1 mindset.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter, unlocking the ability to offer FDIC-insured deposits, consumer lending, and regulated financial products directly to US consumers. For Product Managers, this charter is the defining career opportunity -- designing an entire product suite for the world's largest banking market, backed by $783M in quarterly profit and 100M+ customer learnings from LatAm.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure:** Founding US Team Product Managers should negotiate for 1.5-2x the standard RSU grant, pushing total equity from $120K-$260K to $180K-$390K over four years. PMs who define the US product strategy will directly determine Nubank's US revenue trajectory, and the equity should reflect this product-to-revenue linkage. Frame this as: "The products I define will determine whether Nubank succeeds in the US market. My equity should reflect this direct impact on market cap."

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit:** Nubank's $783M quarterly profit means the US product launch is backed by proven profitability, not venture capital runway. NYSE: NU stock reflects real earnings from 100M+ customers, giving enhanced RSU grants tangible, immediate value. The Founding US Team equity premium is a high-conviction ask because the underlying business is already profitable.

- **Negotiation Script:** "I am very excited about defining Nubank's US product strategy following the January 29th charter approval. As a Product Manager on the Founding US Team, I would be determining which products launch first and how Nubank differentiates in the US market. Given the $783M quarterly profit and the direct link between product decisions and US revenue, I would like an enhanced RSU package of $180K-$390K over four years, reflecting the 1.5-2x Founding US Team premium."

#### Global Levers

1. **US Market Creation Premium (New York):** "I am not joining to optimize an existing product -- I am joining to create Nubank's US product suite from scratch. This is a 0-to-1 mandate in the $23 trillion US banking market. I would like a base of $180K+ and an enhanced RSU package of $180K-$390K over four years reflecting the Founding US Team premium and the $783M quarterly profit backing this expansion."

2. **Regulatory Product Expertise Scarcity:** "PMs who can design consumer financial products that are both delightful and compliant with US banking regulations (TILA, ECOA, UDAAP) are extremely rare. My experience in regulated product design directly enables the US charter launch. This scarcity justifies upper-quartile compensation and a $10K-$15K base premium."

3. **Dual-Currency Protection (Sao Paulo):** "I would like to structure a portion of my compensation in USD to align with Nubank's NYSE listing and the US product mandate. A USD-pegged component protects against BRL volatility and reflects that my product decisions will drive USD-denominated US revenue backed by $783M in quarterly profit."

4. **LatAm-to-US Product Localization Value:** "Nubank's competitive advantage in the US will come from adapting decade-proven LatAm product innovations for US consumers. I bring both US market intuition and appreciation for Nubank's product philosophy -- this cross-market perspective is worth a 10-15% premium, targeting $190K+ base and $65K+ annual equity."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In New York, target $250K-$292K total comp by securing Founding US Team equity ($180K-$390K RSU/4yr) and anchoring base at $175K+. The $783M quarterly profit and 0-to-1 US product mandate justify above-band compensation. In Sao Paulo, target R$1,600K-R$2,002K ($320K-$400K) with USD-denominated components. In Berlin, target EUR350K-EUR416K ($381K-$453K) by leveraging EU fintech PM scarcity and the US Charter growth story. Frame every conversation around product-to-revenue attribution: "The products I define will determine Nubank's US market cap impact."
