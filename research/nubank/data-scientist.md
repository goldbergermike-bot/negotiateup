#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at Nubank operate at the intersection of statistical rigor and financial impact, building models that drive credit decisions, fraud detection, pricing optimization, and customer lifecycle management for over 100 million customers. Nubank's data science organization is one of the most sophisticated in global fintech, with deep expertise in causal inference, experimentation platforms, and credit risk modeling at scale -- all contributing to the $783M quarterly profit and 30%+ ROE that make Nubank the most profitable digital bank in Latin America.

The January 29, 2026 US National Bank Charter creates extraordinary demand for Data Scientists who can build US-specific credit models, fair lending analytics (ECOA/Reg B), and regulatory reporting systems from the ground up. Nubank's proprietary financial dataset -- spanning a decade of LatAm consumer behavior across 100M+ accounts -- is one of the richest in global fintech, and the US expansion adds an entirely new data domain. Data Scientists joining the Founding US Team will build the credit intelligence that determines whether Nubank succeeds in the US market, with the $783M quarterly profit providing both the financial backing and the proof that data-driven credit decisions work at scale.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter. For Data Scientists, this charter introduces an entirely new modeling domain: US consumer credit scoring, US fair lending compliance (ECOA, Reg B), and US regulatory data requirements -- all built on Nubank's existing data science infrastructure that has driven $783M in quarterly profit from 100M+ LatAm customers.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure:** Founding US Team Data Scientists should negotiate for 1.5-2x the standard RSU grant, pushing total equity from $120K-$250K to $180K-$375K over four years. Data Scientists who build the US credit models will directly determine Nubank's US lending profitability -- the same data-driven approach that generated $783M in quarterly profit in LatAm. Frame this as: "My credit models will determine whether Nubank's US lending operation is profitable. The equity should reflect this direct P&L impact."

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit:** Nubank's $783M quarterly profit is, in large part, the result of superior data science and credit modeling. The enhanced RSU grants for Founding US Team Data Scientists are backed by the very discipline they practice -- proving that the equity has tangible, earnings-backed value. NYSE: NU stock reflects the financial impact of data-driven decisions at scale.

- **Negotiation Script:** "I am very interested in joining the Founding US Team following the January 29th charter approval. As a Data Scientist, I would be building the credit models that determine Nubank's US lending profitability -- the same data-driven approach that has driven $783M in quarterly profit in LatAm. I would like an enhanced RSU package of $180K-$375K over four years, reflecting the 1.5-2x Founding US Team premium and the direct P&L impact of US credit modeling."

#### Global Levers

1. **US Credit Modeling Scarcity (New York):** "Data Scientists who can build US-compliant credit models -- with ECOA fair lending analysis, SR 11-7 model risk management, and US credit bureau integration -- are in extremely high demand. My experience in US credit risk directly maps to Nubank's charter needs. I would like a base of $175K+ and Founding US Team equity of $180K-$375K over four years, backed by Nubank's $783M quarterly profit."

2. **100M-Customer Dataset Value:** "Nubank's financial dataset is one of the richest in global fintech -- 100M+ accounts, a decade of LatAm consumer behavior. The opportunity to work with this data and build US models from scratch is unique. I would like RSU grants of $60K+ annually to reflect the dataset advantage and my contribution to extending its value into the US market."

3. **Dual-Currency Protection (Sao Paulo):** "I would like to structure a portion of my compensation in USD to align with Nubank's NYSE listing and USD earnings. A USD-pegged component protects against BRL volatility and reflects that my credit models will drive USD-denominated US lending revenue, contributing to the $783M quarterly profit trajectory."

4. **Regulatory Data Science Premium:** "US banking regulators require model interpretability, bias testing, and comprehensive documentation (SR 11-7/OCC 2011-12) that goes far beyond standard data science work. This regulatory data science expertise commands a 10-15% premium. I am targeting upper-quartile compensation with an 18%+ bonus target tied to US credit performance metrics."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In New York, target $240K-$282K total comp by securing Founding US Team equity ($180K-$375K RSU/4yr) and anchoring base at $170K+. Cite the $783M quarterly profit as proof that data-driven credit decisions work at scale, and position yourself as the person who replicates that success in the US. In Sao Paulo, target R$1,550K-R$1,938K ($310K-$388K) with USD-denominated components. In Berlin, target EUR340K-EUR402K ($370K-$437K) by leveraging EU fintech data science scarcity. Frame every conversation around credit-model-to-profit attribution.
