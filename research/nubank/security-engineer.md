#### Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at Nubank protect the financial data and transactions of over 100 million customers across the world's largest digital bank, which generates $783M in quarterly profit. This role is charter-compliance-critical -- the OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve impose stringent cybersecurity requirements on national banks, and Nubank's US operations will be subject to FFIEC examination standards, GLBA Safeguards Rule, and enhanced cyber risk management expectations. Security engineers work across application security, cloud infrastructure security, identity and access management, fraud detection, and incident response in an environment where a security breach has both financial and regulatory consequences.

The January 29, 2026 US National Bank Charter has elevated security engineering from an operational function to a regulatory-critical, board-level priority. Security Engineers joining the Founding US Team will build the security program that must pass OCC examination from day one of US operations. The $783M quarterly profit means Nubank has the financial resources to invest in world-class security -- and the regulatory obligation to do so. CEO David Velez built a digital bank that serves 100M+ customers securely; Founding US Team security engineers extend that trust infrastructure into the most scrutinized regulatory environment in the world.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter. For Security Engineers, this charter is the single most consequential event defining the scope and urgency of their work. US national banks face the most rigorous cybersecurity examination standards in global banking (FFIEC, GLBA, OCC Heightened Standards), and Nubank must meet these from day one. Security engineering is the most charter-critical technical function at Nubank, backed by $783M in quarterly profit.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure:** Founding US Team Security Engineers should negotiate for 1.5-2x the standard RSU grant, pushing total equity from $120K-$260K to $180K-$390K over four years. Security failures can result in consent orders or charter revocation -- the stakes are existential for Nubank's US operation. Frame this as: "My security work directly protects the US charter. A security finding from OCC could jeopardize the entire US expansion. The equity should reflect this charter-protective contribution."

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit:** Nubank's $783M quarterly profit demonstrates the company's commitment to security at scale -- protecting 100M+ accounts and billions in transactions. The enhanced RSU grants are backed by real earnings, not speculation. Security engineers at pre-revenue fintechs work with limited budgets; Founding US Team security engineers at Nubank have the financial backing of a profitable company with a regulatory obligation to invest in security.

- **Negotiation Script:** "I am very excited about building Nubank's US security program following the January 29th charter approval. Security engineering is the most charter-critical function -- OCC examiners will scrutinize our cybersecurity controls, and findings could jeopardize the charter itself. Given the $783M quarterly profit and the existential importance of security to the US charter, I would like an enhanced RSU package of $180K-$390K over four years, reflecting the 1.5-2x Founding US Team premium."

#### Global Levers

1. **Charter-Critical Security Premium (New York):** "Security engineering is the single most regulatory-critical technical function for Nubank's US charter. OCC examiners will scrutinize cybersecurity controls, and any finding could jeopardize the charter. My experience in banking security and FFIEC compliance directly mitigates this existential risk. I would like a base of $185K+ and Founding US Team equity of $180K-$390K over four years, backed by Nubank's $783M quarterly profit."

2. **FFIEC/GLBA Expertise Scarcity:** "Security engineers who understand FFIEC cybersecurity examination standards, GLBA Safeguards Rule implementation, and OCC heightened standards are in extreme demand and short supply. This regulatory security expertise commands a 15-20% premium over standard security roles. I am targeting the top of the posted range at $200K+ base."

3. **Dual-Currency Protection (Sao Paulo):** "I would like to structure a portion of my compensation in USD to align with Nubank's NYSE listing. A USD-pegged component protects against BRL volatility and reflects that my security work protects the US charter and the $783M quarterly profit trajectory."

4. **Board-Level Impact and Regulatory Accountability:** "Security findings from OCC examinations go directly to Nubank's board of directors. The security controls I build will be examined by federal regulators and reported to the board. This level of organizational impact should be reflected in compensation -- I am targeting $195K+ base and a 20%+ bonus target reflecting the $783M quarterly profit and charter-protective stakes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In New York, target $250K-$292K total comp by securing Founding US Team equity ($180K-$390K RSU/4yr) and anchoring base at $180K+. The $783M quarterly profit and charter-critical security mandate justify top-of-band compensation. In Sao Paulo, target R$1,600K-R$2,002K ($320K-$400K) with USD-denominated components. In Berlin, target EUR350K-EUR416K ($381K-$453K) by leveraging EU security engineer scarcity and the FFIEC compliance premium. Frame every conversation around charter protection: "My security work directly protects the US charter from regulatory findings."
