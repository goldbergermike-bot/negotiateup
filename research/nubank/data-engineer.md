#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at Nubank build and operate the data infrastructure that powers the world's largest digital bank -- real-time streaming pipelines, batch processing systems, data warehouses, and analytics platforms that process financial data from over 100 million customer accounts, contributing to $783M in quarterly profit. Nubank's data stack includes Apache Spark, Kafka, Flink, and proprietary data platforms built on AWS, handling petabytes of financial transaction data with strict latency, accuracy, and compliance requirements.

The January 29, 2026 US National Bank Charter introduces a new dimension of complexity: US regulatory reporting data pipelines (Call Reports, BSA/AML filings, HMDA data), US data residency requirements, and cross-border data governance frameworks that must satisfy both LatAm and US regulators. Data Engineers joining the Founding US Team will build the data infrastructure that enables every US regulatory filing, every US credit decision, and every US transaction monitor. The $783M quarterly profit means this data infrastructure work is backed by proven financial performance and full executive commitment to the US expansion.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter. For Data Engineers, this charter creates the most demanding data infrastructure challenge in Nubank's history -- building US-compliant data pipelines, regulatory reporting systems, and cross-border data governance from the ground up. Every US regulatory filing depends on data engineering, backed by $783M in quarterly profit.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure:** Founding US Team Data Engineers should negotiate for 1.5-2x the standard RSU grant, pushing total equity from $105K-$230K to $158K-$345K over four years. Data Engineers who build the US regulatory reporting pipelines and real-time transaction monitoring systems are creating compliance-critical infrastructure -- without these pipelines, Nubank cannot operate as a US national bank. Frame this as: "The regulatory data pipelines I build are a legal requirement for operating under the US charter. The equity should reflect this compliance-critical contribution."

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit:** Nubank's $783M quarterly profit is powered by data infrastructure that processes billions of transactions across 100M+ accounts. The enhanced RSU grants are backed by proven earnings, not speculation. Data Engineers at pre-revenue fintechs build pipelines for small data volumes; Founding US Team Data Engineers at Nubank extend petabyte-scale, battle-tested infrastructure into US-regulated territory.

- **Negotiation Script:** "I am excited about building Nubank's US data infrastructure following the January 29th charter approval. As a Data Engineer on the Founding US Team, I would be building the regulatory reporting pipelines, real-time transaction monitoring systems, and cross-border data governance that the US charter requires. Given the $783M quarterly profit and the compliance-critical nature of this data infrastructure, I would like an enhanced RSU package of $158K-$345K over four years, reflecting the 1.5-2x Founding US Team premium."

#### Global Levers

1. **US Regulatory Data Pipeline Expertise (New York):** "Building regulatory reporting pipelines for US banking -- Call Reports, BSA/AML filings, HMDA data -- requires specialized knowledge that most data engineers do not have. My experience in banking data pipelines directly enables Nubank's US compliance. I would like a base of $160K+ and Founding US Team equity of $158K-$345K over four years, backed by Nubank's $783M quarterly profit."

2. **Petabyte-Scale Financial Data Platform:** "Nubank's data platform processes petabytes of financial data from 100M+ accounts -- this is top-tier data engineering with banking-grade accuracy requirements. Compensation should be benchmarked against top data engineering roles, not mid-stage fintech. I am targeting $55K+ annual RSU value and a base of $165K+."

3. **Dual-Currency Protection (Sao Paulo):** "I would like to structure a portion of my compensation in USD to align with Nubank's NYSE listing. A USD-pegged component protects against BRL volatility and reflects that the US data pipelines I build will enable USD-denominated regulatory compliance backed by $783M in quarterly profit."

4. **Real-Time BSA/AML Compliance Value:** "The real-time transaction monitoring system I will build for BSA/AML compliance is not just a technical deliverable -- it is a regulatory requirement that, if deficient, could result in consent orders or charter revocation. This compliance-critical scope justifies a 10-15% premium over standard data engineering offers and an 18%+ bonus target reflecting the $783M quarterly profit."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In New York, target $225K-$262K total comp by securing Founding US Team equity ($158K-$345K RSU/4yr) and anchoring base at $155K+. The $783M quarterly profit and compliance-critical data infrastructure mandate justify above-band compensation. In Sao Paulo, target R$1,400K-R$1,778K ($280K-$356K) with USD-denominated components. In Berlin, target EUR300K-EUR369K ($326K-$401K) by leveraging EU data engineering scarcity and the regulatory pipeline premium. Frame every conversation around compliance-critical infrastructure: "The US charter cannot operate without the data pipelines I build."
