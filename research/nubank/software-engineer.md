#### Negotiation DNA

Nubank is no longer a fintech challenger -- it is Latin America's largest digital bank with over 100 million customers, posting $783M in quarterly profit with a 30%+ ROE. On January 29, 2026, Nubank received US National Bank Charter approval, marking the most significant expansion in the company's history. Software Engineers joining now are not entering a mature organization in maintenance mode -- they are joining a profitable public company that is building an entirely new US banking operation from scratch.

The Founding US Team dynamic fundamentally changes the negotiation calculus for Software Engineers. Engineers who would normally receive standard RSU grants at a public company can negotiate for 1.5-2x enhanced equity packages because Nubank needs founding engineers to build its US-market infrastructure. The $783M quarterly profit removes startup risk from the equation entirely -- this is profitable expansion backed by proven unit economics across 100M+ accounts, not speculative growth.

For Software Engineers specifically, Nubank's Clojure-heavy, microservices-first architecture means candidates with functional programming experience or distributed systems knowledge carry outsized leverage. The US buildout requires rebuilding core banking primitives for US regulatory compliance (ACH, Fedwire, FDIC), giving early engineers architectural influence rarely available at companies of this scale. CEO David Velez built the largest digital bank in Latin America from a single credit card product -- Software Engineers joining the US Founding Team are writing the next chapter.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter from the OCC, unlocking the $23 trillion US consumer banking market. Software Engineers joining the US buildout in the first 12-18 months are founding members of this operation -- not backfill hires for an existing team. This is a ground-up build of a new banking platform in the world's largest financial market, backed by a company generating $783M in quarterly profit.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure:** Founding US Team Software Engineers should negotiate for 1.5-2x the standard RSU grant, pushing annual equity value from $20K-$45K/yr to $30K-$68K/yr (vesting over 4 years). This translates to total RSU packages of $120K-$270K for Founding US Team members versus the standard $80K-$180K. Frame this as: "I am building the US banking platform from day one -- my equity should reflect founder-level contribution, not standard-hire compensation."

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit:** Unlike joining an early-stage fintech where equity is speculative, Nubank's $783M quarterly profit and 30%+ ROE provide a concrete stability floor beneath the equity. NYSE: NU stock is backed by real earnings from 100M+ customers, not future projections. The enhanced RSU grants carry materially lower risk than comparable "founding team" equity at pre-revenue companies, making the 1.5-2x multiplier a high-conviction negotiation ask.

- **Negotiation Script:** "I am excited about the US Charter opportunity announced on January 29th. I understand Nubank is building its US banking operation from scratch, and I want to be part of the founding engineering team. Given that I would be helping build the core infrastructure for the US market -- and that Nubank is generating $783M in quarterly profit, so this is not startup risk -- I would like to discuss an enhanced equity package in the range of $120K-$270K in RSUs over four years, reflecting the Founding US Team premium of 1.5-2x standard grants."

#### Global Levers

1. **Founding US Team Equity Multiplier (New York):** "Given the US Charter approval on January 29, 2026, I am joining as a founding engineer of Nubank's US operation. I would like to negotiate an enhanced RSU package of $120K-$270K over four years -- 1.5-2x the standard grant -- reflecting the founding-team nature of this role. Nubank's $783M quarterly profit means this equity is backed by real earnings, not speculation."

2. **Clojure/Functional Programming Premium:** "Nubank's Clojure-first architecture is distinctive in the industry, and my experience with functional programming and immutable data patterns directly accelerates my ramp-up. I would like a $10K-$20K base salary premium reflecting this specialized skill match -- engineers with production Clojure experience are exceptionally rare in the US market, and Nubank's entire platform depends on this stack."

3. **Dual-Currency Arbitrage (Sao Paulo):** "I would like to structure my compensation with a USD-denominated base or a currency-hedging arrangement. Given that Nubank reports earnings in USD and trades on NYSE, a USD-pegged component of R$50K-R$100K ($10K-$20K) protects against BRL volatility while aligning my compensation with the company's reporting currency and its $783M quarterly profit trajectory."

4. **Sign-On Bonus for Vesting Gap:** "My current RSU vesting schedule means I am leaving $30K-$60K on the table in unvested equity. I would like a sign-on bonus of $25K-$50K to offset this forfeiture, structured as a one-time payment in the first 30 days. This is standard practice at public fintechs competing for engineering talent, and Nubank's profitability supports this investment in Founding US Team recruitment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In New York, target $200K-$238K total comp by securing Founding US Team equity ($120K-$270K RSU/4yr) plus a $10K-$20K Clojure premium on base. Anchor every ask on the $783M quarterly profit and the once-in-a-generation US market entry. In Sao Paulo, target R$1,200K-R$1,490K ($240K-$298K) by negotiating USD-denominated components and enhanced RSU grants reflecting the Founding US Team premium. In Berlin, target EUR250K-EUR311K ($272K-$338K) by leveraging EU fintech talent scarcity and the US Charter growth story. Every region should frame the candidate as a founding member of Nubank's US banking operation, not a standard hire at a mature company.
