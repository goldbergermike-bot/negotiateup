#### Negotiation DNA

Solutions Architects at Nubank design the system-level architecture that connects Nubank's banking platform to external partners, payment networks, regulatory systems, and third-party integrations across a platform serving 100M+ customers and generating $783M in quarterly profit. This role requires deep technical expertise in distributed systems, API design, cloud architecture, and integration patterns, combined with the ability to translate business requirements into scalable technical solutions. Nubank's architecture spans hundreds of microservices processing billions of transactions -- a complexity level matched only by the largest global banks and tech companies.

The January 29, 2026 US National Bank Charter creates massive new architecture challenges: integrating with US payment networks (ACH, Fedwire, RTP, FedNow), connecting to US credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion), and building compliant data exchange with US regulators (OCC, FDIC, Federal Reserve). Solutions Architects joining the Founding US Team are the connective tissue between Nubank's proven platform and the entire US financial ecosystem. The $783M quarterly profit means this integration work is backed by a profitable business expanding into a new market, not a startup hoping to find product-market fit.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter. For Solutions Architects, this charter represents the most architecturally complex expansion in Nubank's history -- integrating the proven LatAm platform with an entirely new ecosystem of US payment networks, regulatory systems, and financial infrastructure. Every US banking product depends on the integration architecture these engineers design, backed by $783M in quarterly profit.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure:** Founding US Team Solutions Architects should negotiate for 1.5-2x the standard RSU grant, pushing total equity from $120K-$260K to $180K-$390K over four years. The US payment network integrations (ACH, Fedwire, RTP, FedNow) and credit bureau connections these architects design will directly enable Nubank's US revenue streams. Frame this as: "Every dollar of US revenue flows through the integrations I architect. The equity should reflect this revenue-enabling contribution."

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit:** Nubank's $783M quarterly profit demonstrates that the integration architecture works at scale in LatAm. The enhanced RSU grants are backed by proven financial performance, and NYSE: NU stock reflects real earnings from 100M+ customers. Founding US Team architects extend a proven architecture into a new market, carrying far less risk than integration engineers at pre-revenue fintechs.

- **Negotiation Script:** "I am excited about architecting Nubank's US integrations following the January 29th charter approval. As a Solutions Architect on the Founding US Team, I would be designing the connections to US payment networks, credit bureaus, and regulatory systems -- the integration layer that enables all US revenue. Given the $783M quarterly profit and the revenue-enabling nature of this architecture work, I would like an enhanced RSU package of $180K-$390K over four years, reflecting the 1.5-2x Founding US Team premium."

#### Global Levers

1. **US Financial Integration Expertise (New York):** "Integrating with US payment networks (ACH, Fedwire, RTP, FedNow) and credit bureaus requires deep knowledge of US financial infrastructure that most architects do not have. My experience in US payment systems and banking integrations directly enables Nubank's US launch. I would like a base of $180K+ and Founding US Team equity of $180K-$390K over four years, backed by Nubank's $783M quarterly profit."

2. **Architecture Scope Beyond Standard SA:** "This role requires designing cross-border architecture that spans LatAm and US regulatory environments, connecting to payment networks on two continents. This scope exceeds a standard Solutions Architect role and approaches Principal Architect territory. I would like compensation reflecting this expanded scope -- $190K+ base and $55K+ annual RSU value."

3. **Dual-Currency Protection (Sao Paulo):** "I would like to structure a portion of my compensation in USD to align with Nubank's NYSE listing. A USD-pegged component protects against BRL volatility and reflects that the US integrations I design will generate USD-denominated revenue backed by $783M in quarterly profit."

4. **Regulatory Architecture Scarcity:** "Architects who can design OCC-examinable systems with proper audit trails, data lineage, and regulatory reporting are in extremely short supply. My background in regulated systems architecture commands a premium -- I am targeting upper-quartile base ($195K+) and an 18% bonus target reflecting the $783M quarterly profit and the regulatory stakes of the US buildout."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In New York, target $255K-$298K total comp by securing Founding US Team equity ($180K-$390K RSU/4yr) and anchoring base at $175K+. The $783M quarterly profit and revenue-enabling integration mandate justify above-band compensation. In Sao Paulo, target R$1,600K-R$2,022K ($320K-$404K) with USD-denominated components. In Berlin, target EUR350K-EUR420K ($381K-$457K) by leveraging EU fintech architecture talent scarcity. Frame every conversation around integration-as-revenue-enabler: "Every US banking product depends on the architecture I design."
