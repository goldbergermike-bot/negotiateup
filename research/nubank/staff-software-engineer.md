#### Negotiation DNA

Staff Software Engineers at Nubank operate at the intersection of deep technical expertise and organizational strategy, driving architectural decisions that affect 100 million customers and billions of dollars in daily transaction volume. This is a premium role over senior engineering, reflecting the expectation that Staff engineers own multi-team technical strategy, define platform standards, and make build-vs-buy decisions that shape Nubank's competitive trajectory. With the January 29, 2026 US National Bank Charter, Staff engineers are uniquely positioned to architect the foundational systems for Nubank's North American operations -- a greenfield mandate backed by $783M in quarterly profit and a $60B+ market cap.

The Founding US Team dynamic at the Staff level is exceptionally compelling. Staff engineers joining during the charter window will have influence comparable to VP-level technical leaders -- setting technical direction for an entire geographic market, defining hiring bars, mentoring the US engineering team, and representing Nubank's technical capabilities to US regulators. The $783M quarterly profit means this is not speculative startup equity -- it is enhanced equity at a proven, profitable fintech entering the world's largest banking market. CEO David Velez has built the largest digital bank in Latin America, and Staff engineers joining the Founding US Team are architecting the next phase of that vision.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter. For Staff Software Engineers, this charter represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to define the technical architecture of a US-regulated digital bank with the scale, funding, and proven execution of a 100M+ customer platform generating $783M in quarterly profit. Staff engineers are not joining to optimize existing systems -- they are building the regulated financial infrastructure for Nubank's largest addressable market.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure:** Founding US Team Staff Software Engineers should negotiate for 1.5-2x the standard RSU grant, pushing total equity from $240K-$480K to $360K-$720K over four years. At the staff level, RSUs are the primary wealth-creation vehicle, and this enhanced grant reflects the outsized architectural impact of founding-phase decisions. Frame this as: "My platform decisions will directly enable or constrain Nubank's US revenue for the next decade. The equity should reflect this architect-level founding contribution."

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit:** The enhanced RSU grants at the Staff level are backed by Nubank's $783M quarterly profit and 30%+ ROE -- the strongest financial foundation of any company offering "founding team" equity premiums. NYSE: NU stock represents real earnings from 100M+ customers, not forward projections. This stability floor makes the 1.5-2x multiplier a low-risk, high-conviction negotiation position.

- **Negotiation Script:** "As a Staff engineer joining the Founding US Team after the January 29th charter approval, I would be architecting the platform that all of Nubank's US revenue flows through. Given the $783M quarterly profit and the foundational nature of these architectural decisions, I would like an enhanced RSU package of $360K-$720K over four years, reflecting the 1.5-2x Founding US Team premium. This is not a standard Staff hire -- this is the architect of Nubank's US banking platform."

#### Global Levers

1. **Founding US Team Architecture Premium (New York):** "At the Staff level, I am not joining to write features -- I am joining to architect the US banking platform from the ground up. The charter was approved on January 29, 2026, and the architectural decisions made in the next 12-18 months will define Nubank's US operations for a decade. I would like an enhanced RSU package of $360K-$720K over four years, reflecting 1.5-2x the standard grant and the $783M quarterly profit that backs this equity."

2. **Cross-Border Platform Complexity Multiplier:** "Building a banking platform that operates under Brazilian Central Bank, Mexican CNBV, Colombian SFC, and now US OCC/Federal Reserve regulations is an extraordinary technical challenge. Very few engineers in the world have designed systems with this level of regulatory complexity. I would like the base at $290K-$320K with a 20% bonus target to reflect this scarcity."

3. **Dual-Currency Structure (Sao Paulo):** "I would like to structure a significant portion of my compensation in USD to align with Nubank's NYSE listing and USD-denominated earnings. A USD-pegged base of R$500K-R$750K ($100K-$150K) protects against BRL volatility and reflects the global nature of this Staff-level platform role."

4. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "My competing offers include Staff-level roles at top-tier tech companies at $450K+ total comp. Nubank's offer needs to be competitive at $400K+ TC to reflect the additional regulatory complexity and the founding-team scope. The Founding US Team RSU premium of 1.5-2x makes this achievable -- I am asking for enhanced equity, not an unrealistic base."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In New York, target $420K-$485K total comp by securing Founding US Team equity ($360K-$720K RSU/4yr) and anchoring base at $280K+. The $783M quarterly profit and once-in-a-generation US charter justify above-band compensation. In Sao Paulo, target R$2,800K-R$3,460K ($560K-$692K) with USD-denominated components and maximum RSU grants. In Berlin, target EUR600K-EUR721K ($652K-$784K) by leveraging the scarcity of Staff-level fintech architects in the EU market. Frame every conversation around the founding-architect narrative: "I am not filling a headcount -- I am building the platform that enables Nubank's US banking operation."
