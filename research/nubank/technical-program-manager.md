#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at Nubank drive the execution of complex, cross-functional engineering programs that span the world's largest digital bank, serving 100M+ customers and generating $783M in quarterly profit. TPMs coordinate across engineering, product, design, data science, legal, compliance, and operations teams to deliver programs that affect the entire customer base. The role demands deep technical fluency -- Nubank TPMs are expected to understand system architectures, identify technical risks, and make informed tradeoff recommendations alongside engineering leadership.

The January 29, 2026 US National Bank Charter has created the most complex program management challenge in Nubank's history: coordinating the simultaneous buildout of US banking infrastructure, regulatory compliance systems, partner integrations, and product launches across multiple time zones and regulatory jurisdictions. TPMs joining the Founding US Team will own the end-to-end US launch program, managing regulatory milestones with zero tolerance for delay while coordinating delivery across Sao Paulo, Mexico City, and New York. The $783M quarterly profit means this program is fully funded and strategically critical, not a speculative initiative that might be deprioritized.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter. For Technical Program Managers, this charter represents the most complex cross-functional program in the company's history -- coordinating simultaneous delivery of regulatory systems, infrastructure, products, and operational processes required to launch US banking operations. The $783M quarterly profit ensures this program has full executive backing and resources.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure:** Founding US Team TPMs should negotiate for 1.5-2x the standard RSU grant, pushing total equity from $110K-$240K to $165K-$360K over four years. TPMs who manage the US launch program will directly influence the timeline of Nubank's US revenue generation -- every week of delay in the program is a week of deferred US market cap impact. Frame this as: "I am managing the program that determines when Nubank starts generating US revenue. The equity should reflect this timeline-to-revenue accountability."

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit:** Nubank's $783M quarterly profit means the US launch program is backed by proven financial performance and full executive commitment. The enhanced RSU grants carry tangible, earnings-backed value. TPMs at pre-revenue fintechs manage programs that might be cancelled; Founding US Team TPMs manage the highest-priority program at a profitable, $60B+ company.

- **Negotiation Script:** "I am very interested in managing Nubank's US launch program following the January 29th charter approval. As a TPM on the Founding US Team, I would be coordinating the most complex cross-functional program in Nubank's history -- infrastructure, compliance, product, and operations across four countries and multiple regulatory jurisdictions. Given the $783M quarterly profit and the director-level scope of this program, I would like an enhanced RSU package of $165K-$360K over four years, reflecting the 1.5-2x Founding US Team premium."

#### Global Levers

1. **US Launch Program Scope (New York):** "I will be managing the most complex program in Nubank's history -- the US banking launch. This involves coordinating infrastructure, compliance, product, and operations across four countries and multiple regulatory jurisdictions. This is director-level program scope, and I would like a base of $170K+ and Founding US Team equity of $165K-$360K over four years, backed by Nubank's $783M quarterly profit."

2. **Regulatory Program Expertise:** "Managing programs with hard regulatory deadlines -- OCC conditions, FDIC readiness, BSA/AML implementation -- requires specialized experience that most TPMs do not have. My background in regulated program delivery is directly relevant, and I would like a 15% premium over the midpoint, targeting $175K+ base."

3. **Dual-Currency Protection (Sao Paulo):** "I would like to structure a portion of my compensation in USD to align with Nubank's NYSE listing. A USD-pegged component protects against BRL volatility and reflects the cross-border nature of this TPM role coordinating between Sao Paulo and New York, backed by $783M in quarterly profit."

4. **Executive and Regulatory Stakeholder Access:** "TPMs on the US launch program will present to Nubank's C-suite, board, and US regulators. This level of stakeholder access and accountability is unusual for a TPM role and typically corresponds to director-level compensation. I am targeting an 18%+ bonus to reflect this responsibility and the $783M quarterly profit that underpins the program's strategic importance."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In New York, target $235K-$272K total comp by securing Founding US Team equity ($165K-$360K RSU/4yr) and anchoring base at $165K+. The $783M quarterly profit and director-level US launch program scope justify above-band compensation. In Sao Paulo, target R$1,450K-R$1,860K ($290K-$372K) with USD-denominated components. In Berlin, target EUR320K-EUR386K ($348K-$421K) by leveraging EU TPM scarcity and the regulated banking launch premium. Frame every conversation around program-to-revenue timeline: "I manage the program that determines when Nubank starts generating US revenue."
