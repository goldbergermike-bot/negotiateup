#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at Nubank build the intelligent systems at the core of the world's largest digital bank -- credit risk models, fraud detection algorithms, personalization engines, conversational AI, and automated decision systems that serve over 100 million customers and contribute directly to $783M in quarterly profit. This is an AI premium role, reflecting the intense market competition for ML/AI talent and the outsized business impact of machine learning in financial services. Nubank's ML stack processes billions of financial signals in real-time, powers credit decisions worth billions of dollars annually, and drives customer engagement through intelligent product recommendations.

The January 29, 2026 US National Bank Charter creates new ML/AI challenges at the intersection of cutting-edge AI and stringent regulation: building US-compliant credit models with fair lending guarantees (ECOA, Reg B), deploying real-time fraud detection for US payment rails, developing explainable AI for OCC examination (SR 11-7), and creating AI-powered customer experiences for US consumers. ML/AI Engineers joining the Founding US Team sit at the intersection of the two most valuable technical skill sets in modern fintech -- AI expertise and US banking regulatory knowledge. The $783M quarterly profit is, in large part, the direct result of superior ML-driven credit decisions, proving the value of this function at scale.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter. For ML/AI Engineers, this charter introduces the highest-stakes machine learning challenges in the company's history -- building AI systems that must satisfy both cutting-edge performance requirements and stringent US regulatory standards for fairness, transparency, and accountability. The $783M quarterly profit is proof that ML-driven credit decisions work at scale, and the US charter extends this approach to the world's largest banking market.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure:** Founding US Team ML/AI Engineers should negotiate for 1.5-2x the standard RSU grant, pushing total equity from $200K-$400K to $300K-$600K over four years. ML/AI Engineers building US credit models will directly determine Nubank's US lending profitability -- the same ML-driven approach that generated $783M in quarterly profit. Frame this as: "My credit models and fraud detection systems will determine whether Nubank's US lending operation is profitable. The AI premium plus the Founding US Team premium justifies top-of-band equity."

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit:** Nubank's $783M quarterly profit is substantially attributable to ML-driven credit decisions and fraud detection. The enhanced RSU grants are backed by the very discipline ML/AI Engineers practice -- proving that this equity has tangible, earnings-backed value. NYSE: NU stock directly reflects the financial impact of superior machine learning at scale.

- **Negotiation Script:** "I am very excited about the ML/AI challenges created by the January 29th US charter approval. I would be building the credit models and fraud detection systems that determine Nubank's US lending profitability -- the same ML-driven approach that has generated $783M in quarterly profit in LatAm. Given the AI market premium, the Founding US Team opportunity, and the direct P&L impact of this work, I would like an enhanced RSU package of $300K-$600K over four years, reflecting 1.5-2x the standard grant."

#### Global Levers

1. **AI Premium Plus US Charter Double Multiplier (New York):** "ML/AI talent already commands a significant market premium. Layering on US banking regulatory compliance -- fair lending models, explainable AI for OCC examination, BSA/AML fraud detection -- creates a double multiplier. I would like a base of $225K+ and Founding US Team equity of $300K-$600K over four years, reflecting the AI premium, the Founding US Team premium, and the $783M quarterly profit that proves ML-driven credit works at scale."

2. **Fair Lending AI Scarcity:** "ML engineers who can build credit models that are both highly predictive and provably fair under ECOA/Reg B are in extraordinary demand. This intersection of cutting-edge ML and regulatory compliance is one of the scarcest skill sets in fintech. My experience in algorithmic fairness and responsible AI justifies top-of-band compensation -- $240K+ base and $80K+ annual equity."

3. **Dual-Currency Protection (Sao Paulo):** "I would like to structure a significant portion of my compensation in USD to align with Nubank's NYSE listing. A USD-pegged component protects against BRL volatility and reflects that my ML models will drive USD-denominated US credit decisions contributing to the $783M quarterly profit trajectory."

4. **Competing AI Offers as Anchors:** "I am evaluating offers from top AI labs and tech companies at $350K-$500K+ total comp. Nubank's offer needs to be competitive with top AI compensation, adjusted for the unique financial impact of ML in banking. I am targeting $240K base and $90K+ annual RSU value. The Founding US Team premium of 1.5-2x makes this achievable within Nubank's equity framework."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In New York, target $320K-$378K total comp by securing Founding US Team equity ($300K-$600K RSU/4yr) and anchoring base at $220K+. The $783M quarterly profit proves ML-driven credit works at scale, and the AI premium plus Founding US Team premium justify above-band compensation. In Sao Paulo, target R$2,300K-R$2,850K ($460K-$570K) with USD-denominated components and maximum equity. In Berlin, target EUR490K-EUR592K ($533K-$644K) by leveraging EU ML engineer scarcity and the fair lending AI premium. Frame every conversation around the double multiplier: "AI premium plus Founding US Team premium, backed by $783M in quarterly profit."
