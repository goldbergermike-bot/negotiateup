#### Negotiation DNA

Senior Software Engineers at Nubank are the technical backbone of a platform that processes billions of financial transactions for over 100 million customers across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. At this level, engineers own the design and delivery of critical banking systems -- from payment processing pipelines to credit underwriting engines -- across Nubank's Clojure, Kotlin, and Python stack. With the January 29, 2026 US National Bank Charter approval, Senior SWEs are in extraordinary demand to bridge Nubank's battle-tested LatAm architecture with US regulatory requirements, making this level the highest-leverage hire for the Founding US Team buildout.

The $783M quarterly profit and 30%+ ROE provide a stability floor that fundamentally differentiates this opportunity from other "founding team" pitches. Nubank is not asking Senior Engineers to take startup risk -- it is asking them to apply proven-scale engineering to the world's largest banking market. CEO David Velez has built a profitable, 100M+ customer digital bank, and Senior SWEs joining the US expansion are extending that platform into new territory with full financial backing. Founding US Team members at the Senior level should negotiate for 1.5-2x standard RSU grants, recognizing that their architectural decisions in the first 12-18 months will define Nubank's US technical foundation for the next decade.

#### US Charter — The Founding US Team Premium

- **Charter Date and Significance:** On January 29, 2026, Nubank received approval for a US National Bank Charter, opening the $23 trillion US consumer banking market. Senior Software Engineers are the most critical hire for the Founding US Team -- they bring the technical depth to architect US-compliant banking systems and the leadership to set engineering standards for the entire US operation. This is not incremental feature work; it is building a regulated banking platform from the ground up.

- **Enhanced Equity Structure:** Founding US Team Senior Software Engineers should negotiate for 1.5-2x the standard RSU grant, pushing total equity from $140K-$300K to $210K-$450K over four years. This translates to $52K-$112K in annual equity value. Frame this as: "At the senior level, my architectural decisions will define the US platform for the next decade. The equity package should reflect the compounding value of these foundational technical choices."

- **Stability Floor — $783M Quarterly Profit:** Nubank's $783M quarterly profit means these enhanced RSU grants are backed by one of the most profitable fintechs in the world. NYSE: NU is not a speculative pre-IPO ticker -- it represents real earnings from 100M+ customers. The risk-adjusted value of Founding US Team RSUs at Nubank far exceeds comparable "founding team" equity at pre-revenue neobanks, making the 1.5-2x multiplier a well-supported negotiation position.

- **Negotiation Script:** "I am very interested in joining the Founding US Team following the January 29th charter approval. As a senior engineer, my architectural decisions will directly shape Nubank's US banking platform for years to come. Given the $783M quarterly profit backing this expansion -- this is profitable growth, not startup risk -- I would like an enhanced RSU package of $210K-$450K over four years, reflecting 1.5-2x the standard grant for Founding US Team members at the senior level."

#### Global Levers

1. **Founding US Team Equity Multiplier (New York):** "With the US Charter approved on January 29, 2026, I am joining as a founding senior engineer of Nubank's US operation. I would like to negotiate an enhanced RSU package of $210K-$450K over four years -- 1.5-2x the standard grant. My architectural decisions will define the US platform, and Nubank's $783M quarterly profit means this equity carries real, not speculative, value."

2. **FAANG-Equivalent Scope at Fintech Premium:** "The technical challenges at Nubank -- real-time fraud detection across 100M+ accounts, multi-currency payment processing, cross-border regulatory compliance -- match or exceed senior scope at top-tier tech companies. I would like my base compensation to reflect $190K-$230K to match the scope of this role, particularly given the additional complexity of US banking regulatory systems."

3. **Dual-Currency Protection (Sao Paulo):** "I would like to structure a portion of my compensation in USD to align with Nubank's reporting currency and NYSE listing. A USD-pegged component of R$100K-R$200K ($20K-$40K) protects against BRL volatility. Nubank's $783M quarterly profit in USD makes this a natural alignment of incentives."

4. **Sign-On Bonus for Unvested Equity:** "My current vesting schedule means I am leaving $60K-$120K in unvested RSUs on the table. I would like a sign-on bonus of $50K-$100K to offset this forfeiture. This is standard at public companies competing for senior talent, and the Founding US Team opportunity justifies Nubank's investment in rapid senior hiring."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In New York, target $285K-$335K total comp by securing Founding US Team equity ($210K-$450K RSU/4yr) and anchoring base at $200K+. Cite the $783M quarterly profit as proof this is not startup risk but profitable expansion into the world's largest banking market. In Sao Paulo, target R$1,800K-R$2,270K ($360K-$454K) by negotiating USD-denominated components and enhanced RSU grants. In Berlin, target EUR400K-EUR477K ($435K-$519K) by leveraging EU fintech scarcity and the US Charter expansion narrative. At every region, frame your candidacy as a founding architect of the US banking platform, not a standard senior hire.
