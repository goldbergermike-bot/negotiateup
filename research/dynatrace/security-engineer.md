*Total compensation includes base salary, Dynatrace RSUs (NYSE: DT) vesting over four years with a one-year cliff, and annual performance bonus (typically 12-18% of base). Security Engineers command a premium within Dynatrace's engineering bands due to talent scarcity. Detroit packages reflect approximately 10-12% cost-of-living adjustment below Waltham MA. London packages are denominated in GBP £.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Dynatrace

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone validated the company's platform strategy, and security is a critical enabler of this growth. Enterprise customers will not commit $100M+ in log consumption to a platform they do not trust with their most sensitive telemetry data. Security Engineers at Dynatrace protect the platform that protects the world's largest enterprises, creating a trust foundation that directly enables revenue growth.

The shift from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" powered by Davis AI introduces novel security challenges. When Davis AI automatically detects, diagnoses, and fixes issues without human intervention, the security implications multiply: autonomous actions on production systems must be authenticated, authorized, audited, and reversible. Security Engineers who can design the trust and safety framework for autonomous operations are protecting both Dynatrace and its customers from the risks inherent in AI-driven automation.

Dynatrace's Application Security product line — including Runtime Application Protection, Vulnerability Analytics, and Security Analytics — is a growing revenue contributor. Security Engineers who can build and extend these capabilities drive direct product revenue while also strengthening platform trust. The $100M log consumption milestone includes security-relevant log data, making security analytics a growth driver in its own right.

### 🤖 Dynatrace Autonomous Action & Davis AI Lever

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone prove the Autonomous Remediation thesis. The Davis AI engine is shifting the industry from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" — automatically detecting, diagnosing, and fixing issues without human intervention. As a Security Engineer, you design the trust, safety, and authorization frameworks that make it safe for Davis AI to act autonomously on enterprise production systems. Your compensation should reflect that Autonomous Remediation without robust security is a liability, not a feature.

When Davis AI performs Autonomous Remediation — automatically rolling back a deployment, scaling infrastructure, or isolating a compromised service — every automated action must pass through security controls. Security Engineers design the authorization models, audit trails, blast-radius controls, and rollback mechanisms that make autonomous action safe at enterprise scale. Without this security infrastructure, Autonomous Remediation cannot be trusted.

Use this framing: "Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone show that enterprises trust Dynatrace with their most critical data. The shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation powered by Davis AI requires a security engineer who can design the trust framework for autonomous action — authentication, authorization, audit, and safety controls. My background in [security engineering / zero-trust architecture / secure automation] maps directly to making Autonomous Remediation enterprise-safe."

#### Global Lever 1: Autonomous Remediation Security Framework

Designing security controls for AI-driven autonomous action is a novel and high-value challenge: "Autonomous Remediation means Davis AI takes action on production systems. I will design the security framework — authorization policies, blast-radius controls, audit logging, and rollback mechanisms — that makes these autonomous actions safe for the world's most security-conscious enterprises."

#### Global Lever 2: Application Security Product

Dynatrace's Application Security product line drives revenue and deepens platform adoption: "I will build and extend Dynatrace's Application Security products — Runtime Application Protection, Vulnerability Analytics, and Security Analytics. These capabilities leverage the $100M log consumption data stream reported during the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat to deliver security insights that competitors cannot match."

#### Global Lever 3: Platform & Data Security

Protecting the Dynatrace platform and the petabytes of enterprise telemetry data it processes is a foundational trust requirement: "I have secured platforms handling [X] TB/PB of sensitive enterprise data. At Dynatrace, platform security directly enables the $100M log consumption milestone — enterprises will only send their most sensitive observability data to a platform they trust completely."

#### Global Lever 4: Compliance & Enterprise Trust

Enterprise security compliance — SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, GDPR — is a prerequisite for enterprise adoption: "I have led [SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / FedRAMP] compliance programs for enterprise SaaS platforms. At Dynatrace, compliance directly enables sales into regulated industries, expanding the addressable market for Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation capabilities."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $182,000 base with 900 DT RSUs (approximately $49,500 at current DT price ~$55). Your accept-at floor should be $260,000 total comp. Cite the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, the $100M log consumption milestone, and your ability to secure the Davis AI and Autonomous Remediation platform. If you hold a competing security offer from CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, or Datadog, present it: "I have a security engineering offer from [competitor] at $[X] total comp. Securing Autonomous Remediation at Dynatrace is the most novel security challenge in enterprise software, but my package must reflect the premium that security talent commands." For Detroit roles, open at $164,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants. For London roles, open at £82,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants.
