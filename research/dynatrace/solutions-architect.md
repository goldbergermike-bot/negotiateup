#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Dynatrace

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat demonstrated that the company's land-and-expand go-to-market strategy is delivering exceptional results. Solutions Architects are the technical linchpin of this motion — they design Dynatrace deployments for enterprise customers, guide the transition from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation," and identify expansion opportunities across the platform portfolio. When the company crosses the $100M log consumption milestone, it means that SAs have been architecting increasingly large and comprehensive deployments, and every SA hired accelerates revenue capture.

The shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation powered by Davis AI creates a massive opportunity for Solutions Architects. Enterprise customers need trusted advisors who can guide them through the transformation from passive monitoring to autonomous operations. SAs who understand Davis AI's causal reasoning, Autonomous Remediation workflows, and the architecture required to deploy these capabilities at enterprise scale are the most valuable technical sellers in the observability market.

Solutions Architects at Dynatrace combine deep technical expertise in distributed systems, cloud architecture, and AI-driven operations with customer-facing communication skills. This dual requirement makes the talent pool inherently small. When the company is growing as fast as the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat indicates, every SA hired directly accelerates revenue.

#### Level Mapping — Dynatrace Solutions Architecture Levels

| External Title | Dynatrace Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Solutions Architect | SA1 | 3–5 years |
| Senior Solutions Architect | SA2 | 5–8 years |

### 🤖 Dynatrace Autonomous Action & Davis AI Lever

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone prove the Autonomous Remediation thesis. The Davis AI engine is shifting the industry from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" — automatically detecting, diagnosing, and fixing issues without human intervention. As a Solutions Architect, you translate Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation capabilities into enterprise deployment architectures that drive adoption and revenue expansion. Your compensation should reflect that every deployment you design directly impacts revenue.

The $100M log consumption milestone means enterprise customers are committing massive data volumes to the Dynatrace platform. Solutions Architects who can design deployment architectures that maximize log consumption while demonstrating the value of Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation capabilities drive the consumption-based revenue model that fuels Dynatrace's growth.

Use this framing: "Dynatrace crossed the $100M log consumption milestone during the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat. The shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation requires Solutions Architects who can design enterprise deployments that leverage Davis AI's full capabilities. I combine deep technical expertise in [cloud architecture / observability deployment / enterprise IT operations] with customer-facing skills that accelerate enterprise adoption and expansion revenue."

#### Global Lever 1: Enterprise Deployment Architecture

Solutions Architects who design large-scale Dynatrace deployments directly drive initial deal sizes: "I have designed observability deployment architectures for enterprises with [X] hosts across [Y] cloud providers. At Dynatrace, this translates directly to larger initial deployments and faster time-to-value, driving the land motion that supports the Feb 10, 2026 earnings momentum."

#### Global Lever 2: Davis AI & Autonomous Remediation Enablement

Guiding enterprises from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation is the highest-value SA activity: "I will enable enterprise customers to adopt Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation capabilities — designing the deployment architecture, configuring automation workflows, and building the trust that enterprise operators need to embrace autonomous operations. This directly drives platform upsell revenue."

#### Global Lever 3: Log Consumption & Expansion Strategy

Solutions Architects drive the consumption-based revenue model by designing architectures that increase log ingestion: "The $100M log consumption milestone reported during the Feb 10, 2026 earnings proves the consumption model works. I will design deployment architectures that maximize log consumption while delivering clear ROI through Davis AI analytics, directly driving revenue expansion."

#### Global Lever 4: Competitive Displacement & Migration Architecture

Solutions Architects who can design migration architectures from competing platforms drive competitive wins: "I have led enterprise migrations from [Datadog / Splunk / New Relic / AppDynamics] to modern observability platforms. At Dynatrace, I will design competitive displacement architectures that showcase Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation advantage — capabilities that competitors cannot match."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $185,000 base with 900 DT RSUs (approximately $49,500 at current DT price ~$55). Your accept-at floor should be $265,000 total comp. Cite the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, the $100M log consumption milestone, and your ability to drive enterprise adoption of Davis AI and Autonomous Remediation. If you hold a competing SA offer from Datadog, Splunk/Cisco, or ServiceNow, present it: "I have an SA offer from [competitor] at $[X] total comp. Dynatrace's Autonomous Remediation story is the strongest in the market, and I want to sell it — but my package must reflect the revenue impact I'll deliver." For Detroit roles, open at $166,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants. For London roles, open at £82,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants.
