Engineering Managers at Dynatrace also participate in management-level equity refresh programs. Detroit packages reflect approximately 10-12% cost-of-living adjustment below Waltham MA.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Dynatrace

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat proved that the company's engineering organization is executing at a level that the market rewards. The $100M log consumption milestone, the expansion of Davis AI capabilities, and the accelerating shift from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" are all the output of high-performing engineering teams. Engineering Managers are the force multipliers who make this execution possible — they hire, retain, and develop the engineers building the most sophisticated autonomous operations platform in enterprise software.

The shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation powered by Davis AI requires Engineering Managers who can lead through a fundamental platform transformation. This is not incremental product evolution; it is a category-defining architectural shift. EMs must build teams that combine distributed systems expertise, AI/ML platform skills, and observability domain knowledge — one of the hardest hiring challenges in technology. When you negotiate, frame yourself as the leader who can build and scale the team that delivers on Dynatrace's most important strategic commitment.

Engineering Managers at Dynatrace own team outcomes across reliability, velocity, and talent development. The $100M log consumption milestone and the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat create intense demand for engineering leaders who can scale teams without sacrificing quality or velocity.

#### Level Mapping — Dynatrace Engineering Management Levels

| External Title | Dynatrace Internal Level | Typical YoE | Scope |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
| Engineering Manager | M1 | 6–10 years | Single team (6-10 ICs) |
| Senior Engineering Manager | M2 | 10–14 years | Multiple teams (15-30 ICs) |
| Director of Engineering | M3 | 14–18 years | Organization (30-60 ICs) |
| VP Engineering | M4 | 18+ years | Division-wide |

### 🤖 Dynatrace Autonomous Action & Davis AI Lever

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone prove the Autonomous Remediation thesis. The Davis AI engine is shifting the industry from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" — automatically detecting, diagnosing, and fixing issues without human intervention. As an Engineering Manager, you build and lead the teams that extend Davis AI's capabilities and deliver on this autonomous vision. Your compensation should reflect that you are responsible for the engineering capacity that determines whether Dynatrace can capture the autonomous operations market.

The $100M log consumption milestone means Dynatrace's platform is processing enterprise data at unprecedented scale. Engineering Managers must build teams that can scale the Davis AI engine, the Grail data lakehouse, and the Autonomous Remediation workflow systems to handle this growth. The talent required — engineers who understand causal AI, real-time distributed systems, and observability — is extremely scarce, making the EM who can recruit and retain this talent invaluable.

Use this framing: "Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone show that the shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation is accelerating. I build the teams that deliver on this vision. My track record of hiring and developing engineers who can work at the intersection of AI and distributed systems is the primary constraint on how fast Dynatrace can execute on the Davis AI roadmap."

#### Global Lever 1: Davis AI Team Building & Talent Strategy

Engineering Managers who can recruit and retain Davis AI platform engineers are solving the hardest talent challenge at Dynatrace: "I have built and scaled engineering teams that deliver AI-driven platform capabilities. The Davis AI engine's expansion from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation requires engineers with a rare combination of skills, and I have a proven track record of attracting and developing this talent."

#### Global Lever 2: Platform Scalability Leadership

The $100M log consumption milestone demands engineering teams that can scale platform infrastructure by 10x: "I have led engineering organizations through [X]x growth in data throughput. Scaling Dynatrace's Grail platform and Davis AI engine to support the consumption growth validated by the Feb 10, 2026 earnings requires exactly this kind of engineering leadership."

#### Global Lever 3: Cross-Functional Delivery & Execution

Engineering Managers at Dynatrace coordinate across product, design, and go-to-market teams to deliver capabilities that drive revenue: "I have led cross-functional delivery of [platform / AI / observability] products from architecture through general availability. At Dynatrace, delivering Autonomous Remediation workflows requires tight coordination between Davis AI, product, and customer success teams."

#### Global Lever 4: Autonomous Remediation Engineering Culture

Building a culture that embraces autonomous operations requires Engineering Managers who think beyond traditional monitoring: "Dynatrace is defining the Autonomous Remediation category. I build engineering cultures that embrace AI-driven automation, where teams design systems that act autonomously rather than just alerting. My leadership philosophy aligns directly with Davis AI's vision of replacing human toil with intelligent automation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $255,000 base with 1,800 DT RSUs (approximately $99,000 at current DT price ~$55). Your accept-at floor should be $350,000 total comp. Cite the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, the $100M log consumption milestone, and your ability to build and lead the teams delivering Davis AI and Autonomous Remediation. If you hold a competing EM offer from Datadog, Splunk/Cisco, or a hyperscaler, present it: "I have an EM offer from [competitor] at $[X] total comp. I want to lead the Autonomous Remediation engineering effort at Dynatrace, but my package needs to reflect the leadership impact I'll deliver." For Detroit roles, open at $230,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants. For London roles, open at £118,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants.
