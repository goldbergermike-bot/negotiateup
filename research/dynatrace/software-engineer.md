#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Dynatrace

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat confirmed the company's transformation from a legacy APM vendor into the most consequential autonomous operations platform in enterprise software. The $100M log consumption milestone announced during the same earnings call validated that Dynatrace's consumption-based growth engine is accelerating, and the company is capturing workloads that previously went to competitors. For Software Engineers, this earnings report is your foundational negotiation anchor — it proves that engineering velocity is the primary constraint on Dynatrace's ability to capture a massive and expanding market.

The Davis AI engine is the crown jewel of Dynatrace's technology stack. Unlike competitors who bolt on AI features as afterthoughts, Davis AI is the architectural foundation that powers every product decision. Dynatrace is shifting the entire industry from "Visibility" — simply showing engineers what is happening — to "Autonomous Remediation," where Davis AI automatically detects, diagnoses, and fixes issues without human intervention. Software Engineers at Dynatrace are building the autonomous operations future, and the market is willing to pay for that expertise.

As a Software Engineer at Dynatrace, your code directly powers the platform that monitors the world's most critical enterprise applications. Every feature you ship strengthens Davis AI's ability to autonomously remediate issues at scale. When you negotiate, anchor on the fact that Dynatrace's growth — from the $100M log consumption milestone to the expansion of Autonomous Remediation capabilities — depends entirely on engineering talent.

#### Level Mapping — Dynatrace Engineering Levels

| External Title | Dynatrace Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Software Engineer | L1 (IC1) | 1–3 years |
| Software Engineer II | L2 (IC2) | 3–5 years |
| Senior Software Engineer | L3 (IC3) | 5–8 years |
| Staff Software Engineer | L4 (IC4) | 8–12 years |
| Principal Software Engineer | L5 (IC5) | 12+ years |

### 🤖 Dynatrace Autonomous Action & Davis AI Lever

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone prove the Autonomous Remediation thesis is working. The Davis AI engine is shifting the industry from "Visibility" — simply observing systems — to "Autonomous Remediation," where problems are automatically detected, diagnosed, and fixed without human intervention. As a Software Engineer, you should negotiate for premiums that reflect your ability to build the systems that power this autonomous future.

When Dynatrace reports hitting the $100M log consumption milestone, it tells you that enterprise customers are moving massive workloads onto the platform. The Davis AI engine processes this data to deliver Autonomous Remediation at scale — automatically identifying root causes, correlating signals across the full stack, and executing remediation actions. Software Engineers who can build and extend this architecture are building one of the most sophisticated AI-driven operations platforms in the world.

Use the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat as your timing lever: "Dynatrace just posted an earnings beat and crossed the $100M log consumption milestone. The market is validating the shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation powered by Davis AI. I want to be part of building that future, and I expect my compensation to reflect the urgency and strategic importance of this work."

Frame your skills directly: "I understand that Dynatrace's Davis AI engine is driving the industry shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation. My background in [distributed systems / real-time data processing / cloud-native architectures] positions me to contribute directly to scaling this platform as consumption grows beyond the $100M milestone."

#### Global Lever 1: Davis AI Platform Engineering

Dynatrace's Davis AI engine processes billions of events per day, performing causal analysis across the full technology stack. As a Software Engineer, your ability to contribute to this AI-driven platform is inherently valuable. When negotiating, frame your experience in terms of real-time data processing and AI system integration: "I have experience building systems that process [X] events per second with causal reasoning capabilities. Davis AI's ability to move from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation requires exactly this kind of engineering, and my skills will translate into direct platform improvements."

#### Global Lever 2: Log Analytics & Consumption Growth

The $100M log consumption milestone proves that Dynatrace's log analytics platform is capturing enterprise workloads at scale. Software Engineers who can optimize log ingestion, storage, and query performance directly drive revenue growth: "Dynatrace crossed $100M in log consumption revenue as reported on Feb 10, 2026. My experience in [log pipeline optimization / stream processing / data compression] maps directly to scaling this revenue engine."

#### Global Lever 3: Cloud-Native & Kubernetes Observability

Dynatrace's OneAgent technology provides automatic, full-stack observability for cloud-native environments. Software Engineers who understand Kubernetes, microservices, and container orchestration are critical to platform expansion: "My expertise in [Kubernetes / container orchestration / cloud-native observability] directly supports Dynatrace's expansion into enterprise cloud environments. As organizations migrate to cloud-native architectures, the demand for autonomous monitoring powered by Davis AI is accelerating."

#### Global Lever 4: Autonomous Remediation Workflows

Autonomous Remediation is Dynatrace's differentiator — the ability for Davis AI to not just detect problems, but automatically fix them. Software Engineers who can build the workflow engines, integration APIs, and remediation playbooks that power this capability are in high demand: "Dynatrace is shifting from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation. I bring [workflow automation / API design / event-driven architecture] experience that directly enables building the remediation actions Davis AI triggers automatically."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $155,000 base with 600 DT RSUs (approximately $33,000 at current DT price ~$55). Your accept-at floor should be $200,000 total comp. Cite the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, the $100M log consumption milestone, and your ability to build the Davis AI and Autonomous Remediation platform. If you hold a competing offer from Datadog, New Relic, or Splunk, present it directly: "I have an offer from [competitor] at $[X] total comp, but I believe Dynatrace's Autonomous Remediation vision powered by Davis AI is the stronger long-term bet. I need my package to reflect that conviction." For Detroit roles, open at $138,000 base with equivalent RSU grants. For London roles, open at £65,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants denominated in GBP.
