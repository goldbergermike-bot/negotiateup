#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Dynatrace

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat demonstrated that the company's product strategy is working. The $100M log consumption milestone and the accelerating adoption of Davis AI capabilities proved that Dynatrace's product-led growth engine is capturing enterprise demand at scale. Product Managers are the strategic architects of this growth — they define the roadmap, prioritize features, and translate the shift from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" into product capabilities that enterprise customers are willing to pay for.

The Davis AI engine is the core differentiator that makes Dynatrace's product strategy unique. Unlike competitors who offer dashboards and alerts, Dynatrace PMs design products that automatically detect, diagnose, and fix problems. This Autonomous Remediation paradigm requires Product Managers who think beyond monitoring — PMs who can design autonomous workflows, define the user experience for AI-driven operations, and build product experiences that earn enterprise trust in automated decision-making.

Product Managers at Dynatrace sit at the intersection of the Davis AI engineering organization, the go-to-market teams, and enterprise customers. The $100M log consumption milestone validates the consumption-based pricing model that PMs designed and optimized. When you negotiate, anchor on the direct connection between product decisions and revenue growth.

### 🤖 Dynatrace Autonomous Action & Davis AI Lever

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone prove the Autonomous Remediation thesis. The Davis AI engine is shifting the industry from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" — automatically detecting, diagnosing, and fixing issues without human intervention. As a Product Manager, you define the product experiences that translate Davis AI's capabilities into customer value and revenue. Your compensation should reflect that you are shaping the product strategy for the most important transformation in enterprise observability.

The shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation is fundamentally a product challenge, not just an engineering one. Product Managers must design experiences where enterprise customers trust an AI system to take automated action on production infrastructure. This requires sophisticated UX thinking, deep understanding of enterprise risk tolerance, and the ability to design progressive automation workflows that build trust incrementally.

Use this framing: "Dynatrace crossed the $100M log consumption milestone during the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat. The shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation powered by Davis AI creates an enormous product opportunity. I bring [product strategy / AI product design / enterprise SaaS] experience that will accelerate the translation of Davis AI capabilities into revenue-generating product experiences."

#### Global Lever 1: Davis AI Product Strategy

Product Managers who can define the roadmap for Davis AI's evolution into Autonomous Remediation are making the most consequential product decisions at the company: "I will own the product roadmap that translates Davis AI's technical capabilities into enterprise-ready Autonomous Remediation workflows. My experience in [AI product management / enterprise workflow design] maps directly to this challenge."

#### Global Lever 2: Consumption-Based Growth & Log Analytics

The $100M log consumption milestone validates the consumption-based pricing model. PMs who can optimize this model drive direct revenue impact: "Dynatrace's $100M log consumption milestone, reported during the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, proves the consumption model works. My experience in [consumption pricing / usage-based growth / PLG metrics] positions me to optimize this revenue engine."

#### Global Lever 3: Enterprise Customer Expansion

Product Managers drive the land-and-expand motion by designing product experiences that increase platform adoption: "I have driven [X]% expansion revenue by designing product experiences that increase enterprise adoption. At Dynatrace, expanding from infrastructure monitoring into Davis AI-powered Autonomous Remediation represents the most significant upsell opportunity in the company's history."

#### Global Lever 4: Autonomous Remediation Product Experience

Designing the product experience for autonomous operations requires PMs who understand trust, risk, and progressive automation: "Autonomous Remediation requires enterprise customers to trust Davis AI to take action on production systems. I will design the product experiences — from recommendation engines to fully automated workflows — that build this trust progressively and drive adoption."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $185,000 base with 900 DT RSUs (approximately $49,500 at current DT price ~$55). Your accept-at floor should be $260,000 total comp. Cite the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, the $100M log consumption milestone, and your ability to define the product strategy for Davis AI and Autonomous Remediation. If you hold a competing PM offer from Datadog, ServiceNow, or PagerDuty, present it: "I have a PM offer from [competitor] at $[X] total comp. Dynatrace's Autonomous Remediation vision is the strongest product thesis in observability, and I want to shape it." For Detroit roles, open at $165,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants. For London roles, open at £82,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants.
