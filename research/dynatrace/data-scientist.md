#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Dynatrace

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat confirmed that the Davis AI engine is the company's most important competitive advantage. The $100M log consumption milestone means that the volume of data flowing through Dynatrace's platform is growing exponentially — and Data Scientists are the ones who build the intelligence models that transform this raw data into the causal insights and automated actions that define Autonomous Remediation. Without Data Scientists, Davis AI is just a data pipeline. With them, it is the industry-defining autonomous operations engine.

The shift from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" requires Data Scientists who can build and train the models that power causal root-cause analysis, anomaly detection, predictive alerting, and automated decision-making. Davis AI's deterministic causal reasoning is a unique approach in the observability market — it does not rely on probabilistic ML alone but combines causal AI with topology-aware reasoning. Data Scientists who can extend this architecture are among the most strategically important hires at the company.

Data Scientists at Dynatrace work at the intersection of massive-scale observability data and AI-driven operations. The $100M log consumption milestone proves that the data is available. Your role is to build the models that turn it into autonomous action.

#### Level Mapping — Dynatrace Data Science Levels

| External Title | Dynatrace Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Data Scientist | DS1 | 2–4 years |
| Data Scientist II | DS2 | 4–6 years |
| Senior Data Scientist | DS3 | 6–10 years |
| Staff Data Scientist | DS4 | 10–14 years |
| Principal Data Scientist | DS5 | 14+ years |

### 🤖 Dynatrace Autonomous Action & Davis AI Lever

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone prove the Autonomous Remediation thesis. The Davis AI engine is shifting the industry from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" — automatically detecting, diagnosing, and fixing issues without human intervention. As a Data Scientist, you build the intelligence models that power Davis AI's causal reasoning, anomaly detection, and automated decision-making. Your compensation should reflect that you are building the brain of the autonomous operations platform.

Davis AI's approach to Autonomous Remediation is architecturally distinct: it combines deterministic causal reasoning with topology-aware analysis and statistical anomaly detection. Data Scientists who can extend this multi-paradigm intelligence architecture — adding new causal models, training anomaly detectors on the $100M+ of log consumption data, and building predictive capabilities — are building the most sophisticated AI-driven operations system in enterprise software.

Use this framing: "Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone prove that the data foundation for Autonomous Remediation is in place. Davis AI's shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation requires Data Scientists who can build causal reasoning models, train anomaly detectors at massive scale, and design the decision frameworks that enable automated action. My background in [causal inference / anomaly detection / time-series analysis] maps directly to this challenge."

#### Global Lever 1: Causal AI & Root-Cause Analysis Models

Davis AI's causal reasoning engine is the core technology behind Autonomous Remediation. Data Scientists who can extend this causal AI framework are making the highest-impact contributions: "I will build and extend the causal reasoning models that power Davis AI's root-cause analysis. My experience in [causal inference / Bayesian networks / knowledge graph reasoning] enables me to design models that identify root causes deterministically across complex technology stacks."

#### Global Lever 2: Anomaly Detection at Massive Scale

With $100M in log consumption revenue, Dynatrace processes petabytes of observability data. Data Scientists who can build anomaly detection models at this scale drive product differentiation: "Dynatrace's $100M log consumption milestone, reported on Feb 10, 2026, means the platform processes massive data volumes. I build anomaly detection models that operate at [petabyte scale / billions of time series / multi-dimensional streams] to power Davis AI's real-time detection capabilities."

#### Global Lever 3: Predictive Operations & Forecasting

Autonomous Remediation becomes even more powerful when it can predict issues before they occur. Data Scientists who build predictive models extend Davis AI from reactive to proactive: "I will build predictive models that extend Davis AI from reactive Autonomous Remediation to proactive issue prevention. My experience in [predictive analytics / time-series forecasting / capacity planning models] enables Dynatrace to prevent outages before they impact customers."

#### Global Lever 4: Decision Intelligence for Autonomous Action

The final frontier of Autonomous Remediation is the decision model that determines which automated action to take. Data Scientists who design these decision frameworks define the quality of autonomous operations: "Autonomous Remediation requires decision models that weigh risk, confidence, and impact to determine the optimal automated action. I bring [decision theory / reinforcement learning / risk modeling] experience that directly enables Davis AI to act autonomously with enterprise-grade reliability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $180,000 base with 850 DT RSUs (approximately $46,750 at current DT price ~$55). Your accept-at floor should be $255,000 total comp. Cite the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, the $100M log consumption milestone, and your ability to build the intelligence models that power Davis AI and Autonomous Remediation. If you hold a competing DS offer from Datadog, Splunk/Cisco, or an AI lab, present it: "I have a Data Science offer from [competitor] at $[X] total comp. Davis AI's approach to causal reasoning and Autonomous Remediation is the most technically interesting challenge in observability, but my package must be competitive." For Detroit roles, open at $162,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants. For London roles, open at £80,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants.
