#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Dynatrace

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone validated the company's position as the enterprise platform of choice for AI-driven operations. DevOps Engineers at Dynatrace occupy a uniquely strategic position: they build and maintain the infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment systems that power the platform enabling thousands of enterprises to achieve Autonomous Remediation. When Dynatrace's Davis AI engine shifts the industry from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation," it is the DevOps infrastructure that ensures these autonomous capabilities deploy reliably, scale efficiently, and operate with zero downtime.

DevOps Engineers at Dynatrace understand the customer perspective intimately because they live it. They operate the same cloud-native, Kubernetes-driven, continuously-deployed infrastructure that Dynatrace's enterprise customers use — and this firsthand experience directly informs how the platform's automated monitoring and remediation features work in practice. When Davis AI detects an issue and triggers Autonomous Remediation, the quality of that remediation depends on DevOps patterns that you architect.

The $100M log consumption milestone means the platform's data infrastructure must scale continuously. DevOps Engineers who can automate this scaling — managing petabyte-scale data pipelines, optimizing cloud costs, and ensuring five-nines reliability — are essential to sustaining the consumption-driven growth model.

### 🤖 Dynatrace Autonomous Action & Davis AI Lever

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone prove the Autonomous Remediation thesis. The Davis AI engine is shifting the industry from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" — automatically detecting, diagnosing, and fixing issues without human intervention. As a DevOps Engineer, you build the infrastructure that Davis AI operates on and the deployment pipelines through which Autonomous Remediation capabilities reach production. Your compensation should reflect that the reliability and scalability of the entire autonomous platform depends on your work.

DevOps Engineers have a unique dual role at Dynatrace: you are both the builder of the platform infrastructure and the most informed internal user of Dynatrace's own product. You deploy Dynatrace on Dynatrace. When Davis AI performs Autonomous Remediation on Dynatrace's own infrastructure, the quality of that autonomous action is a direct reflection of the DevOps patterns you designed. This "dogfooding" perspective makes DevOps Engineers invaluable contributors to the product.

Use this framing: "Dynatrace crossed the $100M log consumption milestone during the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat. Scaling this consumption-driven platform requires DevOps engineering at the highest level. I bring [cloud infrastructure / Kubernetes orchestration / CI/CD at scale] experience that directly supports the shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation. Davis AI's ability to autonomously remediate issues depends on the infrastructure reliability I deliver."

#### Global Lever 1: Platform Infrastructure & Reliability

Dynatrace's platform must operate at five-nines reliability to support enterprise Autonomous Remediation. DevOps Engineers who deliver this reliability are foundational: "I have built and maintained infrastructure achieving [X]% uptime for [Y]-scale data platforms. Dynatrace's Davis AI can only deliver Autonomous Remediation if the underlying infrastructure is rock-solid, and my SRE/DevOps expertise ensures that reliability."

#### Global Lever 2: Kubernetes & Cloud-Native Operations

Dynatrace operates across multi-cloud and hybrid environments. DevOps Engineers who are experts in Kubernetes, container orchestration, and cloud-native operations are essential: "My expertise in [Kubernetes at scale / multi-cloud orchestration / container lifecycle management] directly supports Dynatrace's platform operations. As the $100M log consumption milestone drives data volume growth, the Kubernetes infrastructure must scale accordingly."

#### Global Lever 3: CI/CD Pipeline Engineering

Rapid and reliable deployment of Davis AI capabilities requires world-class CI/CD infrastructure: "I have built CI/CD pipelines that deploy [X] times per day across [Y] environments with zero-downtime guarantees. At Dynatrace, shipping Autonomous Remediation features rapidly and safely is the difference between capturing market share and falling behind."

#### Global Lever 4: Autonomous Infrastructure Operations

DevOps Engineers at Dynatrace don't just build infrastructure — they build infrastructure that operates itself, proving the Autonomous Remediation concept from the inside: "Dynatrace's shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation should start with its own infrastructure. I will design self-healing, auto-scaling infrastructure patterns that serve as proof-of-concept for Davis AI's autonomous capabilities. This 'dogfooding' approach strengthens both the platform and the product."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $170,000 base with 750 DT RSUs (approximately $41,250 at current DT price ~$55). Your accept-at floor should be $235,000 total comp. Cite the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, the $100M log consumption milestone, and your ability to build and scale the infrastructure that powers Davis AI and Autonomous Remediation. If you hold a competing offer from Datadog, HashiCorp, or a hyperscaler, present it: "I have an offer from [competitor] at $[X] total comp. Dynatrace's Autonomous Remediation infrastructure is the most compelling DevOps challenge in observability, but my package must reflect that." For Detroit roles, open at $153,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants. For London roles, open at £78,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants.
