#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Dynatrace

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat validated the company's platform strategy, and the $100M log consumption milestone proved that enterprise customers are deeply invested in the Dynatrace experience. Product Designers at Dynatrace are responsible for making the most complex observability and AI-driven automation platform in the enterprise intuitive, trustworthy, and actionable. This is a design challenge of the highest order: translating Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation capabilities into interfaces that enterprise operators trust to take automated action on production systems.

The shift from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" is as much a design challenge as it is a technical one. Visibility-era products show dashboards, charts, and alerts — design patterns that are well understood. Autonomous Remediation requires entirely new design patterns: trust indicators for AI decisions, progressive automation UX, explainable AI interfaces, and guardrail configurations that give operators confidence in automated actions. Product Designers who can define these new interaction paradigms are creating the visual and experiential language for a new category.

Design at Dynatrace directly impacts customer adoption and retention. When enterprises trust the UI to accurately represent Davis AI's recommendations, they upgrade from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation — a higher-value tier that drives revenue expansion. Product Designers who accelerate this trust-building through design are directly contributing to revenue growth.

#### Level Mapping — Dynatrace Design Levels

| External Title | Dynatrace Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Product Designer | D1 | 2–4 years |
| Product Designer II | D2 | 4–6 years |

| Staff Product Designer | D4 | 10–14 years |
| Principal Product Designer | D5 | 14+ years |

### 🤖 Dynatrace Autonomous Action & Davis AI Lever

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone prove the Autonomous Remediation thesis. The Davis AI engine is shifting the industry from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" — automatically detecting, diagnosing, and fixing issues without human intervention. As a Product Designer, you define the user experience that makes enterprise operators trust and adopt autonomous operations. Your compensation should reflect that you are designing the interface for a paradigm shift in enterprise software.

Autonomous Remediation powered by Davis AI requires design innovation at every level: How do you show operators what Davis AI detected? How do you explain the causal chain that led to a diagnosis? How do you present an automated fix with enough context for an operator to approve it — or trust it to execute automatically? These are unsolved design problems, and the Product Designer who solves them at Dynatrace is defining the UX patterns for an entire industry.

Use this framing: "The Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone show that enterprises are deeply invested in Dynatrace. The shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation powered by Davis AI requires entirely new design paradigms for trust, transparency, and autonomous action. I bring [AI UX / enterprise design / data visualization] experience that will define how operators interact with autonomous systems."

#### Global Lever 1: Davis AI Trust & Explainability Design

Designing trust into AI-driven interfaces is one of the hardest UX challenges in enterprise software: "I will design the trust and explainability layer for Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation recommendations. My experience in [AI explainability UX / decision-support interfaces / trust design patterns] maps directly to helping enterprise operators trust and adopt autonomous operations."

#### Global Lever 2: Data Visualization & Observability UX

Dynatrace processes billions of events per day. Designers who can make this data comprehensible and actionable drive platform adoption: "I have designed data visualization systems that make [complex data / real-time metrics / causal relationships] intuitive for enterprise users. At Dynatrace, this skill directly drives adoption of the platform that crossed the $100M log consumption milestone reported on Feb 10, 2026."

#### Global Lever 3: Enterprise Design Systems & Platform Consistency

Product Designers who build and maintain design systems ensure visual and interaction consistency across Dynatrace's expanding product portfolio: "I have built and scaled design systems for enterprise platforms with [X] products. At Dynatrace, a unified design system ensures that Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation experiences are consistent across infrastructure, application, and log monitoring."

#### Global Lever 4: Autonomous Remediation Workflow Design

Designing the workflow experience for autonomous operations requires new interaction patterns: "Dynatrace is moving from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation. I will design the workflow experiences that allow operators to configure automation levels, set guardrails, review AI decisions, and progressively trust Davis AI to act autonomously. This is greenfield design work that defines a new product category."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $165,000 base with 700 DT RSUs (approximately $38,500 at current DT price ~$55). Your accept-at floor should be $225,000 total comp. Cite the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, the $100M log consumption milestone, and your ability to design the Autonomous Remediation UX for Davis AI. If you hold a competing design offer from Datadog, Grafana Labs, or a major SaaS platform, present it: "I have a design offer from [competitor] at $[X] total comp. Dynatrace's shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation is the most exciting design challenge in observability, but my package needs to reflect that." For Detroit roles, open at $148,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants. For London roles, open at £75,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants.
