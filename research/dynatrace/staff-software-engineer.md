#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Dynatrace

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat validated the most ambitious strategic bet in observability: the transformation from a monitoring vendor into an autonomous operations platform powered by the Davis AI engine. Staff Software Engineers are the architectural backbone of this transformation. When the company crosses the $100M log consumption milestone and accelerates its shift from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation," it is Staff engineers who design the systems, define the abstractions, and make the foundational technical decisions that determine whether the platform can scale to meet enterprise demand.

Staff Software Engineers at Dynatrace own cross-cutting technical initiatives that span multiple teams and product areas. You define the architectural patterns that junior and senior engineers implement. You resolve the hardest technical disputes and set the direction for multi-quarter engineering investments. When Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation capabilities need to scale from thousands to tens of thousands of automated actions per hour, the Staff engineer designs the architecture that makes it possible.

This role commands a premium because the intersection of skills required — deep distributed systems expertise, AI/ML platform knowledge, and observability domain mastery — represents one of the smallest talent pools in enterprise software.

#### Level Mapping — Dynatrace Engineering Levels

### 🤖 Dynatrace Autonomous Action & Davis AI Lever

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone prove the Autonomous Remediation thesis at scale. The Davis AI engine is shifting the industry from "Visibility" — passively observing systems — to "Autonomous Remediation," where Davis AI automatically detects, diagnoses, and fixes issues without human intervention. As a Staff Software Engineer, you are the architect who designs the foundational systems that make this autonomous future possible. Your compensation should reflect that you are making the highest-leverage technical decisions at the company.

The $100M log consumption milestone means that enterprise data volumes flowing into the Dynatrace platform are growing exponentially. Davis AI must process this data in real time to deliver Autonomous Remediation — correlating billions of events, performing deterministic root-cause analysis, and triggering automated workflows. Staff engineers design the data models, query engines, and processing pipelines that make this possible at scale.

Use this framing: "Dynatrace's $100M log consumption milestone, reported during the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, proves that the platform is capturing enterprise workloads at scale. The shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation requires foundational architectural work that I am uniquely qualified to lead. My compensation should reflect the magnitude of these design decisions and their impact on Dynatrace's competitive position."

#### Global Lever 1: Davis AI Architecture & Causal Reasoning

Staff engineers define the architecture of Davis AI's causal reasoning engine. This is the core technology that differentiates Dynatrace from every competitor: "I will own the architectural evolution of Davis AI's causal analysis layer. My experience designing [causal inference systems / knowledge graphs / real-time reasoning engines] at scale positions me to extend Davis AI's capabilities from root-cause detection into fully Autonomous Remediation across the enterprise stack."

#### Global Lever 2: Grail Data Lakehouse & Log Platform

The $100M log consumption milestone is built on Dynatrace's Grail data lakehouse. Staff engineers design the storage, indexing, and query infrastructure that must scale by 10x: "Dynatrace's Grail platform underpins the $100M log consumption milestone announced on Feb 10, 2026. I will architect the next generation of this platform to handle the consumption growth that the market is clearly demanding."

#### Global Lever 3: Platform Scalability & Multi-Cloud Architecture

Dynatrace serves the world's largest enterprises across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Staff engineers design the platform architecture that ensures reliability and performance at global scale: "I bring [multi-tenant platform / global distributed systems / cloud-native architecture] expertise that directly supports Dynatrace's ability to serve the world's most demanding enterprise customers while scaling Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation capabilities."

#### Global Lever 4: Autonomous Remediation Platform Design

Autonomous Remediation is the defining capability of Dynatrace's next decade. Staff engineers design the decision engines, workflow orchestration systems, and integration frameworks that allow Davis AI to act autonomously: "Dynatrace is defining a new category: Autonomous Remediation. I will architect the platform that translates Davis AI's insights into automated actions across the full technology stack. This is the highest-impact work at the company, and my compensation should reflect that."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $275,000 base with 2,200 DT RSUs (approximately $121,000 at current DT price ~$55). Your accept-at floor should be $380,000 total comp. Cite the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, the $100M log consumption milestone, and your ability to architect Davis AI and Autonomous Remediation at the platform level. If you hold a competing offer from Datadog, Splunk/Cisco, or a hyperscaler, present it: "I have an offer from [competitor] at $[X] total comp. Dynatrace's Autonomous Remediation vision is the strongest thesis in observability, and I want to build it — but my package must be competitive with Staff-level offers from top-tier platforms." For Detroit roles, open at $248,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants. For London roles, open at £125,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants.
