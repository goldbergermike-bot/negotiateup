#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Dynatrace

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone placed data engineering at the center of the company's growth story. The $100M log consumption milestone is, at its core, a data engineering achievement — petabytes of observability data ingested, stored, indexed, and queried in real time through Dynatrace's Grail data lakehouse. Data Engineers are the ones who build and scale the data infrastructure that makes this revenue possible. Without the Grail data platform performing at massive scale, the $100M log consumption milestone does not happen.

The shift from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" powered by the Davis AI engine is fundamentally a data challenge. Autonomous Remediation requires Davis AI to process, correlate, and reason over data from every layer of the technology stack — infrastructure metrics, application traces, logs, security events, and user experience data — in real time. Data Engineers who can design the data models, pipelines, and storage systems that feed Davis AI's causal reasoning engine are building the data foundation for the autonomous operations future.

Dynatrace's Grail data lakehouse is the company's most important technical asset after the Davis AI engine itself. It is purpose-built for observability data, providing unified storage and analytics for metrics, traces, logs, and events. Data Engineers who can extend and scale Grail are working on the platform that underpins every product line and every dollar of consumption revenue.

### 🤖 Dynatrace Autonomous Action & Davis AI Lever

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone prove the Autonomous Remediation thesis. The Davis AI engine is shifting the industry from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" — automatically detecting, diagnosing, and fixing issues without human intervention. As a Data Engineer, you build the data infrastructure that feeds Davis AI's intelligence — the pipelines, storage systems, and query engines that process petabytes of observability data in real time. Your compensation should reflect that Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation is only as good as the data infrastructure you build.

The $100M log consumption milestone is a direct measure of the data infrastructure's capacity. Every dollar of log consumption revenue flows through the data pipelines, storage layers, and query engines that Data Engineers build and maintain. As consumption grows — and the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat confirms it is growing rapidly — the data infrastructure must scale proportionally. Data Engineers who can deliver this scaling are the most directly revenue-connected engineers at the company.

Use this framing: "Dynatrace's $100M log consumption milestone, reported during the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, is built on the data infrastructure I will design and scale. The shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation means Davis AI needs to process more data, faster, with higher fidelity. My experience in [data lakehouse architecture / real-time stream processing / petabyte-scale storage] maps directly to scaling this revenue-generating data platform."

#### Global Lever 1: Grail Data Lakehouse Architecture

Dynatrace's Grail data lakehouse is the foundational data platform. Data Engineers who can extend and optimize Grail drive platform performance and revenue: "I will design and scale the Grail data lakehouse that powers Dynatrace's $100M log consumption milestone. My experience in [data lakehouse design / columnar storage / query optimization] maps directly to extending Grail's capabilities as consumption grows."

#### Global Lever 2: Real-Time Data Pipeline Engineering

Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation requires real-time data ingestion and processing. Data Engineers who build these pipelines enable autonomous operations: "I have built real-time data pipelines processing [X] events per second with [Y] latency. At Dynatrace, these pipelines feed Davis AI's causal reasoning engine, enabling the shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation at enterprise scale."

#### Global Lever 3: Query Engine & Analytics Performance

Fast query performance on petabyte-scale observability data drives customer satisfaction and platform adoption: "I have optimized query engines for [petabyte-scale / real-time / multi-tenant] data systems. At Dynatrace, query performance directly impacts the customer experience for the enterprise accounts driving the $100M log consumption milestone reported on Feb 10, 2026."

#### Global Lever 4: Multi-Signal Data Correlation

Autonomous Remediation requires correlating data across metrics, traces, logs, and events. Data Engineers who build this correlation layer power Davis AI's unified analysis: "Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation depends on correlating data from infrastructure, applications, logs, and security in real time. I will build the data correlation layer that enables Davis AI to reason across the full stack — the foundational capability that makes autonomous operations possible."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $178,000 base with 850 DT RSUs (approximately $46,750 at current DT price ~$55). Your accept-at floor should be $250,000 total comp. Cite the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, the $100M log consumption milestone, and your ability to scale the Grail data platform that powers Davis AI and Autonomous Remediation. If you hold a competing offer from Snowflake, Databricks, Datadog, or a hyperscaler, present it: "I have a data engineering offer from [competitor] at $[X] total comp. Dynatrace's Grail data lakehouse is the most consequential data platform in observability, and the $100M log consumption milestone proves it — but my package must reflect my ability to scale it." For Detroit roles, open at $160,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants. For London roles, open at £80,000 base with equivalent DT RSU grants.
