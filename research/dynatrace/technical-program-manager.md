#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Dynatrace

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone validated the company's multi-product platform strategy, and Technical Program Managers are the operational leaders who coordinate the engineering execution required to sustain this growth trajectory. When Dynatrace shifts from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" powered by the Davis AI engine, the complexity of the engineering program increases by an order of magnitude — spanning AI/ML infrastructure, real-time data pipelines, workflow automation, and cross-product integration. TPMs who can manage this complexity are essential to Dynatrace's ability to execute on its most important strategic commitments.

Technical Program Managers at Dynatrace coordinate across multiple engineering teams, product management, design, and go-to-market organizations. The shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation requires cross-cutting programs that span the entire product portfolio. Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation capabilities must integrate with infrastructure monitoring, application performance, log analytics, and security — each owned by different engineering teams. TPMs are the connective tissue that ensures these integrations ship on time and at quality.

The $100M log consumption milestone creates operational pressure: the platform must scale continuously to support consumption-driven growth while simultaneously shipping new Davis AI capabilities. TPMs who can manage this dual mandate — operational scaling and feature velocity — are critical to maintaining the growth trajectory that earned the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat.

#### Level Mapping — Dynatrace TPM Levels

| External Title | Dynatrace Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Technical Program Manager | TPM1 | 3–5 years |
| Technical Program Manager II | TPM2 | 5–8 years |
| Senior Technical Program Manager | TPM3 | 8–12 years |
| Principal Technical Program Manager | TPM4 | 12+ years |
| Director, Technical Programs | TPM5 | 15+ years |

### 🤖 Dynatrace Autonomous Action & Davis AI Lever

Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone prove the Autonomous Remediation thesis. The Davis AI engine is shifting the industry from "Visibility" to "Autonomous Remediation" — automatically detecting, diagnosing, and fixing issues without human intervention. As a Technical Program Manager, you coordinate the cross-functional engineering programs that deliver Autonomous Remediation capabilities to production. Your compensation should reflect that you are managing the most complex and strategically important programs at the company.

Autonomous Remediation is the most cross-cutting initiative in Dynatrace's history. Davis AI must integrate with every product line — infrastructure monitoring, APM, log analytics, security, and cloud automation — to deliver end-to-end autonomous operations. TPMs who can manage the dependencies, timelines, and risk across these integrations are making the execution possible.

Use this framing: "Dynatrace's Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat and $100M log consumption milestone show that the platform is executing well. The shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation requires cross-cutting program management across every product area. Davis AI's integration with infrastructure monitoring, APM, logs, and security represents the most complex program at the company, and my experience in [cross-functional program management / AI platform delivery / enterprise software programs] positions me to drive this execution."

#### Global Lever 1: Davis AI Program Integration & Delivery

Managing the integration of Davis AI capabilities across the product portfolio is the defining TPM challenge at Dynatrace: "I will manage the cross-product integration program for Davis AI's Autonomous Remediation capabilities. My experience leading [AI/ML platform programs / cross-team integrations / enterprise-scale technical programs] maps directly to coordinating the delivery of autonomous operations across Dynatrace's full product suite."

#### Global Lever 2: Platform Scaling Programs

The $100M log consumption milestone creates scaling programs that span infrastructure, data engineering, and platform operations: "Dynatrace's $100M log consumption milestone, reported during the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, means the platform must scale continuously. I will manage the scaling programs that ensure the infrastructure grows ahead of consumption demand while maintaining reliability SLAs."

#### Global Lever 3: Release Engineering & Delivery Cadence

TPMs who can optimize Dynatrace's release cadence accelerate feature delivery across the entire platform: "I have managed release programs that deliver [X features / Y releases per quarter] across [Z engineering teams]. At Dynatrace, accelerating the delivery of Davis AI and Autonomous Remediation capabilities directly drives revenue growth and competitive advantage."

#### Global Lever 4: Strategic Program Execution & Cross-Org Alignment

TPMs who can align engineering, product, and go-to-market organizations around Dynatrace's strategic priorities drive company-level execution: "The shift from Visibility to Autonomous Remediation requires strategic alignment across engineering, product, and sales. I bring [strategic program management / executive communication / cross-org alignment] experience that ensures the entire organization executes cohesively on Dynatrace's most important bet."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $182,000 base with 850 DT RSUs (approximately $46,750 at current DT price ~$55). Your accept-at floor should be $255,000 total comp. Cite the Feb 10, 2026 earnings beat, the $100M log consumption milestone, and your ability to manage the cross-functional programs that deliver Davis AI and Autonomous Remediation.
