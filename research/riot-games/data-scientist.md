**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Riot Games work on some of the most fascinating DS problems in the industry — champion balance optimization, matchmaking fairness modeling, player churn prediction, toxicity detection, and esports performance analytics. Riot's player behavior dataset is unique: 150M+ monthly players generating rich in-game behavioral data that captures moment-to-moment decision-making in competitive environments. The DS function at Riot is deeply respected internally — data science recommendations directly influence champion balance patches that affect the entire player base. Riot's approach to fairness in matchmaking is published and peer-reviewed, and the company has pioneered work on gaming-specific behavioral science. The DS team is collaborative and research-oriented, with opportunities to publish and present at conferences. [Source: Riot Games DS, Player Behavior Research 2025]
