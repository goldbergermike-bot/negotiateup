**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Riot Games shape the visual language, UX, and interface design for the world's most iconic competitive games. Riot's design culture is exceptional — the company views design as a core competency, not a supporting function. Designers at Riot work closely with game designers, engineers, and artists to create interfaces that serve both casual players and professional esports athletes. The Champion Select screen in League, Valorant's buy menu, and the spectator HUD for esports broadcasts are all product design-driven decisions that impact millions. Riot's design team is small and elite, with each designer having outsized influence on player experience. Profit-sharing and premium bonuses make designer comp at Riot significantly above gaming industry averages. [Source: Riot Games Design Team 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Riot Designer (P3-P4) = Google L4 UX = Apple ICT3-4 Design

**Global Levers**

1. **Esports Design Prestige:** "Riot's game interfaces are seen by hundreds of millions of viewers through esports broadcasts. My design work isn't just UX — it's broadcast-ready visual design with a global audience."
2. **Competitive Game UX Expertise:** "Designing interfaces for competitive games requires understanding split-second decision-making, information hierarchy under pressure, and accessibility across skill levels. This is specialized UX that enterprise designers don't have."
3. **Small Team, Large Impact:** "Riot's design team is intentionally small. Each designer has outsized impact on the player experience — I'm not one of 500 designers, I'm one of [X] shaping the UX for 150M+ players."
4. **Premium Gaming Design Comp:** "Riot pays premium comp for designers because design is a core competency, not a cost center. My bonus target should reflect this premium positioning."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $275K TC — $185K base, 25% bonus target, and profit-sharing. My competitive game design portfolio demonstrates exactly the specialized UX thinking Riot needs." Accept at $170K+ base with 20%+ bonus.
