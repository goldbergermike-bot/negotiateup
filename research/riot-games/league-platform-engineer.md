**Negotiation DNA**

This is Riot Games' signature engineering role — the League Platform Engineer. You are building the backend infrastructure, matchmaking systems, real-time game servers, and live-service platform for League of Legends, the world's most played PC game with 150M+ monthly active players and the most-watched esport globally. Riot (owned by Tencent) operates a unique comp model: instead of traditional RSUs, Riot offers equity profit-sharing tied to company performance, plus industry-leading bonuses (15-25%+ of base). This profit-sharing has historically been very lucrative — Riot is consistently one of the most profitable game companies in the world. The League platform must handle extreme concurrency (tens of millions of simultaneous matches), sub-30ms latency requirements for competitive integrity, and 24/7 uptime for a global player base across multiple regional deployments.

**Level Mapping:** Riot Senior Engineer = Google L4-L5 = Meta E4-E5 = Valve Senior Engineer

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The League Platform Engineer builds systems with unique technical requirements:
- **Real-Time Competitive Infrastructure:** Maintaining sub-30ms server tick rates for millions of concurrent matches where competitive integrity is paramount
- **Global Regional Deployment:** Operating independent server regions (NA, EUW, EUNE, KR, CN) with region-specific optimization and cross-region data synchronization
- **Esports Platform:** Engineering the tournament infrastructure that powers the world's most-watched esport, including spectator systems, replay analysis, and broadcast integration
- **Champion/Content Delivery:** Designing the platform that deploys new champions, patches, and balance updates to 150M+ players with zero downtime

**Global Levers**

1. **Esports Revenue & Prestige Frame:** "League of Legends is the world's most-watched esport. The platform I'm building doesn't just serve players — it serves the entire competitive ecosystem. Platform reliability directly impacts Riot's esports business and brand value."
2. **Profit-Sharing Upside:** "Riot's profit-sharing has historically been extremely generous — often equivalent to $80K-$200K+ annually for senior engineers. I want transparency on the profit-sharing formula and recent payout history to properly value this component."
3. **Competitive Integrity Premium:** "Engineering for competitive integrity at this scale is unique. Every millisecond of latency, every edge case in matchmaking fairness, matters to 150M players and a professional esports league. This technical bar justifies premium comp."
4. **Tencent Ownership Stability:** "Unlike public gaming companies subject to stock volatility, Riot's Tencent ownership provides financial stability while the profit-sharing model gives direct upside. I'd like the base salary at the top of band to maximize the guaranteed portion."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the platform for the world's most played PC game and most-watched esport. I'd like base salary at $235K with 25%+ bonus target and full profit-sharing eligibility from year one. League's platform reliability directly impacts $2B+ in annual revenue and the integrity of professional esports." Riot will counter at $210K–$225K base. Accept at $220K+ with 25% bonus target and confirmed profit-sharing details.
