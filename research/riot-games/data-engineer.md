**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Riot Games build the pipelines, warehouses, and real-time streaming infrastructure that process telemetry from 150M+ League players and Valorant's rapidly growing player base. Riot's data platform is central to every major decision — champion balance, matchmaking tuning, content scheduling, anti-cheat detection, and esports analytics. The data engineering challenge at Riot is unique because game telemetry is extremely high-volume (billions of events daily), low-latency (real-time matchmaking depends on it), and domain-specific (understanding game state requires gaming knowledge). Riot's data platform team has invested in modern data infrastructure (Kafka, Spark, data mesh architectures) and operates at a scale that rivals much larger tech companies.
