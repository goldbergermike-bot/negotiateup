### Data Engineer | Riot Games Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity Profit-Sharing + Premium Bonus | Player-First Gaming Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Profit-Sharing) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|-------|------------|
| Los Angeles | $155K–$215K | Equity profit-sharing | 15–25% | $208K–$330K |
| Seattle | $150K–$210K | Equity profit-sharing | 15–25% | $200K–$320K |
| Dublin | €58K–€90K | Profit-sharing | 15–20% | €75K–€120K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Riot Games build the pipelines, warehouses, and real-time streaming infrastructure that process telemetry from 150M+ League players and Valorant's rapidly growing player base. Riot's data platform is central to every major decision — champion balance, matchmaking tuning, content scheduling, anti-cheat detection, and esports analytics. The data engineering challenge at Riot is unique because game telemetry is extremely high-volume (billions of events daily), low-latency (real-time matchmaking depends on it), and domain-specific (understanding game state requires gaming knowledge). Riot's data platform team has invested in modern data infrastructure (Kafka, Spark, data mesh architectures) and operates at a scale that rivals much larger tech companies.
