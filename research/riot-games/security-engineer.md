**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Riot Games protect 150M+ player accounts, the Vanguard anti-cheat system, competitive esports infrastructure, and the virtual economies in League of Legends and Valorant. Riot's security challenges are unique — Vanguard (Riot's kernel-level anti-cheat) is one of the most technically ambitious security systems in gaming, operating at ring-0 to detect cheating before it impacts gameplay. This level of security engineering requires kernel development, reverse engineering, and adversarial expertise rarely found outside security research firms. Riot also faces DDoS campaigns targeting esports broadcasts, account takeover attacks, and organized boosting/botting operations. The security team at Riot is small and elite, with each member having significant impact. [Source: Riot Games Vanguard, Security Team 2025]
