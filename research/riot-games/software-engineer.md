### Software Engineer | Riot Games Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity Profit-Sharing + Premium Bonus | Player-First Gaming Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Profit-Sharing) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|-------|------------|
| Los Angeles | $145K–$200K | Equity profit-sharing | 15–25% | $185K–$310K |
| Seattle | $140K–$195K | Equity profit-sharing | 15–25% | $178K–$300K |
| Dublin | €55K–€85K | Profit-sharing | 10–15% | €68K–€108K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Riot Games (Tencent-owned, Los Angeles) is one of the most premium employers in gaming, with a comp model that consistently ranks among the top in the industry. Riot's unique comp structure combines competitive base salaries with generous bonuses (15-25%) and equity profit-sharing that has historically paid out very well given Riot's exceptional profitability. League of Legends and Valorant together generate $3B+ annually, making Riot one of the most profitable gaming companies per employee. Riot's "player-first" culture means engineers are given significant autonomy and time to build quality — the company ships fewer titles but polishes them obsessively. Software Engineers at Riot work across League of Legends, Valorant, Teamfight Tactics, Wild Rift, and emerging titles. [Source: Riot Games Careers, FY2025-2026 Revenue Estimates]

**Global Levers**

1. **Profit-Sharing Transparency:** "I'd like to understand Riot's profit-sharing formula — what determines the payout, what's the historical range, and what's the vesting/eligibility timeline? This is a critical component of total comp."
2. **Premium Bonus Target:** Riot's bonuses are among the highest in gaming. Push for the top of the range: "I understand Riot's bonus targets range from 15-25%. Given my experience in [relevant area], I'd like to be at 25% to align my incentives with Riot's performance."
3. **Per-Employee Profitability:** "Riot generates more revenue per employee than almost any gaming company. As an engineer at this high-leverage organization, my comp should reflect the outsized value each engineer creates."
4. **Player-First Culture Fit:** Riot heavily weights cultural alignment. Frame your negotiation around player impact: "I'm not just negotiating for comp — I'm joining Riot because I believe in player-first development. But the comp needs to be right for me to leave [current role]."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "I'm targeting $285K TC — $190K base, 25% bonus target, and full profit-sharing eligibility. Riot's comp model is unique, and I want the guaranteed components (base + bonus) to be strong, with profit-sharing as upside." Riot will counter at $160K–$175K base with 20% bonus. Push base to $180K+ with 25% bonus. Accept if guaranteed TC (base + expected bonus) exceeds $225K.
