**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Riot Games maintain the infrastructure that keeps League of Legends and Valorant running 24/7 for 150M+ players globally. Riot's infrastructure is unique — the company operates its own dedicated network backbone (Riot Direct) to optimize latency for competitive gaming, runs regional server clusters across NA, EU, KR, and other regions, and manages one of the most demanding real-time multiplayer infrastructure stacks in the world. The move to cloud-hybrid infrastructure while maintaining sub-30ms latency for competitive games creates DevOps challenges that don't exist in traditional enterprise environments. Riot's DevOps team has invested heavily in Kubernetes, custom orchestration tooling, and automated incident response. [Source: Riot Games Infrastructure, Riot Direct 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Riot DevOps (P3-P4) = Google L3-L4 SRE = Amazon L5-L6 SysDE

**Global Levers**

1. **Riot Direct Network:** "Riot operates its own network backbone to optimize player latency. Working on Riot Direct means managing infrastructure at ISP scale — a unique and technically demanding challenge."
2. **Competitive Latency Requirements:** "Sub-30ms server tick rates for competitive FPS (Valorant) and MOBA (League) require infrastructure optimization beyond standard web services. Every millisecond of latency impacts competitive integrity."
3. **Global Regional Operations:** "Operating independent server regions across NA, EU, KR, and other markets — each with unique regulatory, networking, and performance requirements — creates exceptional operational complexity."
4. **Zero-Downtime Live-Service:** "League and Valorant are always-on services. Patches, infrastructure upgrades, and incident response must happen without impacting player experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $305K TC — $205K base, 25% bonus target, and profit-sharing. Managing gaming infrastructure at Riot's scale — with Riot Direct, global regions, and competitive latency requirements — is specialized DevOps work." Accept at $185K+ base with 20%+ bonus.
