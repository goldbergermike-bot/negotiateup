ML/AI Engineers at Riot Games work on some of the most unique AI problems in the industry: matchmaking optimization, anti-cheat detection, toxicity classification, player behavior prediction, NPC AI, and generative AI for game content creation. Riot's ML stack is production-grade and operates at massive scale — matchmaking ML models serve 150M+ players, anti-cheat models process billions of game events, and behavioral models power the tribunal/honor systems. Riot's investment in ML/AI has accelerated since 2024, with new roles in generative AI for game development (concept art generation, voice synthesis, procedural content), LLM-powered player support, and AI-assisted game balance. The AI premium at Riot is meaningful — these roles are among the most competitively compensated in gaming. [Source: Riot Games ML/AI, Riot Research 2025]
