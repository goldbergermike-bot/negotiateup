**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Riot Games lead teams building the world's most popular competitive games. Riot's "player-first" culture means EMs must balance technical delivery with player experience quality — shipping fast but never at the expense of game quality. Riot's EM role is uniquely empowering: flat-ish org structure, strong engineering culture, and teams that are given time to iterate. EMs at Riot are expected to be technically deep — most were Senior/Staff SWEs before transitioning to management. The profit-sharing model makes EM comp at Riot among the highest in gaming, often rivaling Director-level comp at other companies. Riot's retention of engineering managers is strong, which means openings are rare and highly competitive. [Source: Riot Games EM Framework 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Riot EM (M1) = Google L5-L6 Manager = Meta M1-M2 = Valve Team Lead

**Global Levers**

1. **Riot Culture Leadership Premium:** "Leading a team at Riot requires not just delivery management but cultural stewardship. Riot's player-first culture demands that EMs actively protect engineering quality and player experience — that's harder than managing to a deadline."
2. **Profit-Sharing at Management Level:** "EM-level profit-sharing at Riot is substantial. I'd like full transparency on M1-level payout history to properly evaluate the total package."
3. **Talent Retention Value:** "Riot's engineering talent is some of the best in gaming. As EM, I'm directly responsible for retaining this talent. Each engineer I retain saves Riot $200K+ in replacement costs and maintains team velocity."
4. **Team Size & Scope:** If managing large teams: "I'll be managing [X] engineers with scope across [League/Valorant/shared platform]. My comp should reflect the breadth of my management responsibility."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $450K TC — $260K base, 35% bonus target, and full M1 profit-sharing. Managing at Riot requires both technical depth and cultural leadership — a combination that's rare and valuable. My competing offers are at [X]." Accept at $240K+ base with 30%+ bonus.
