### Solutions Architect | Riot Games Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity Profit-Sharing + Premium Bonus | Player-First Gaming Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Profit-Sharing) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|-------|------------|
| Los Angeles | $170K–$235K | Equity profit-sharing | 15–25% | $232K–$365K |
| Seattle | $165K–$230K | Equity profit-sharing | 15–25% | $225K–$355K |
| Dublin | €65K–€100K | Profit-sharing | 15–20% | €85K–€135K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Riot Games design the technical architecture connecting Riot's game teams with shared platform services — online infrastructure, data platforms, identity systems, and developer tools. Riot's SA role is unique because the "customers" are internal game teams (League, Valorant, TFT, Wild Rift) with very specific real-time performance requirements. SAs must understand both game engine architecture and distributed systems design, bridging the gap between game-specific requirements and platform-wide solutions. Riot's commitment to technical excellence means SAs have the authority and resources to build solutions properly — no cutting corners. The SA function has grown as Riot launches more titles that share underlying platform infrastructure. [Source: Riot Games Platform Architecture 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Riot SA (P4) = Google L4-L5 Solutions = AWS Solutions Architect III-IV

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Game Platform Design:** "I'll be designing platform solutions that serve League, Valorant, TFT, and emerging titles simultaneously. This cross-game architecture scope is broader than most SA roles in tech."
2. **Real-Time Architecture Specialization:** "Gaming architecture requires sub-millisecond design decisions — state synchronization, matchmaking, and anti-cheat all operate in real-time. SA roles that understand real-time distributed systems are rare."
3. **Riot Direct Integration:** "Architecture solutions must account for Riot Direct (the company's network backbone). SAs who can design for custom networking infrastructure have specialized knowledge."
4. **Premium SA Comp:** "Riot pays premium comp across all roles. SA comp should be benchmarked against Riot's premium bands, not gaming industry averages."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $340K TC — $225K base, 25% bonus target, and profit-sharing. My architecture experience in real-time distributed systems maps directly to Riot's platform needs." Accept at $205K+ base with 20%+ bonus.
