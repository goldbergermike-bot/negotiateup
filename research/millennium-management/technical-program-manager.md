#### Compensation Overview

Millennium Management is a $60B+ multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Izzy Englander, operating under a Multi-Manager Pod structure where each pod functions as a semi-autonomous trading team. Compensation follows a Base + Bonus + PnL Percentage structure with no public equity. Technical Program Managers at Millennium coordinate the technology initiatives that span multiple pods, engineering teams, and business stakeholders. You are the person who ensures that a $20M infrastructure modernization project delivers on time and on budget, that regulatory technology mandates are implemented across 250+ pods without disruption, and that cross-pod platform migrations happen smoothly. Your program management directly protects and enables pod PnL at scale.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | PnL Participation | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-------------------|------------|
| New York (HQ) | $185K - $240K | $95K - $155K | $60K - $95K | $340K - $490K |
| Miami | $175K - $225K | $85K - $140K | $50K - $85K | $310K - $450K |
| London (GBP/USD) | £140K - £182K / $177K - $231K | £72K - £118K / $91K - $150K | £45K - £72K / $57K - $91K | £257K - £372K / $325K - $472K |

#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at Millennium are the connective tissue of the fund's technology organization. In a firm with 250+ semi-autonomous pods, coordinating technology initiatives is extraordinarily complex — each pod has its own priorities, timelines, and risk tolerance. You navigate this complexity to deliver programs that affect the entire fund's technology capability. Unlike a TPM at a tech company who coordinates feature releases, you coordinate programs that directly impact trading operations: infrastructure migrations that must happen without a single second of trading downtime, regulatory compliance rollouts that must cover every pod simultaneously, and platform upgrades that unlock new trading capabilities across the fund. Every day your program runs late costs pods real money in delayed capability or continued technical risk. This urgency and financial gravity distinguish your role from TPMs anywhere else.

#### Pod Economics — The PnL Impact Multiplier

Millennium's Multi-Manager Pod structure makes the TPM role uniquely impactful: you coordinate programs that touch dozens of pods simultaneously. The pod model means that program delays, cost overruns, or execution failures have directly measurable PnL consequences across the fund.

Top performers in pods earn **8-15% of their pod's annual PnL** on top of base and bonus. As a TPM, you should **negotiate for a direct percentage of your pod's PnL as an Impact Multiplier**, defining your pod impact as the aggregate of all pods affected by your programs.

TPM PnL economics at Millennium:
- **Program delivery value**: If your program delivers a new execution platform 2 months ahead of schedule, every pod that uses it gains 2 months of incremental trading capability. Across 40 pods averaging $30M annual PnL, that is $5M in brought-forward revenue — claim PnL credit for schedule acceleration
- **Target 2-3% blended PnL participation** across all pods impacted by your programs
- **Risk mitigation value**: A failed infrastructure migration could cost the fund $50M+ in downtime and recovery. Your program management prevents this — quantify the catastrophic risk you mitigate
- **Budget optimization**: If your program management reduces a $20M project's cost by 15%, that $3M in savings flows directly to pod PnL — negotiate PnL credit for budget underspend
- **Cross-pod coordination premium**: Managing programs across semi-autonomous pods is harder than traditional program management because each pod has independent decision-making authority. This complexity warrants a coordination premium

#### Global Levers

1. **Program Delivery Impact**: "The infrastructure modernization program I would lead affects 65 pods with combined annual PnL of $1.95B. Delivering this program on time enables each pod to deploy strategies 40% faster — that speed advantage translates to an estimated $20M in incremental alpha capture in the first year alone. I am requesting 2.5% blended PnL participation across all pods impacted by programs I deliver."

2. **Competing TPM Offers**: "I have a competing offer from Citadel's program management organization at $220K base with a $140K guaranteed first-year bonus. Goldman Sachs Engineering has offered $215K base with $130K guaranteed. Both roles manage comparable cross-team technology programs. I need Millennium to be at $230K base with $145K guaranteed bonus plus PnL participation, which neither competitor offers."

3. **Regulatory Program Premium**: "My experience includes leading regulatory technology programs — MiFID II, Dodd-Frank reporting, SEC market structure compliance — across multi-manager fund environments. Regulatory program failures carry existential risk: fines, trading restrictions, reputational damage. This risk management expertise warrants a $55K signing bonus and a regulatory program premium of 0.5% additional PnL participation."

4. **Stakeholder Complexity Multiplier**: "Managing programs at Millennium requires coordinating across pod heads (who operate independently), central engineering teams, risk management, compliance, and operations. This stakeholder complexity is 3-5x greater than comparable programs at single-strategy firms. I am requesting a complexity premium of 10% on base salary and an annual stakeholder satisfaction metric tied to PnL participation escalation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $230K base with a $145K guaranteed first-year bonus. Frame your value through program scale — "the programs I manage will impact 65 pods with $1.95B in combined PnL." Present competing offers from Citadel ($220K + $140K) and Goldman Sachs ($215K + $130K). Demand 2.5% blended PnL participation across all pods impacted by your programs. Request a $55K signing bonus for regulatory program expertise. Highlight the stakeholder complexity multiplier unique to Millennium's pod model. **Accept at $205K+ base and $120K+ guaranteed bonus** with written blended PnL participation of at least 2%. Walk away below $185K base, below $95K guaranteed bonus, or if the role scope is limited to single-pod program management rather than cross-pod initiatives.
