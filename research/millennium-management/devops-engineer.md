#### Compensation Overview

Millennium Management is a $60B+ multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Izzy Englander, operating under a Multi-Manager Pod structure where each pod functions as a semi-autonomous trading team. Compensation is Base + Bonus + PnL Percentage with no public equity — this is a private firm. DevOps Engineers at Millennium own the deployment pipelines, infrastructure automation, and operational reliability that every trading pod depends on. When a pod needs to deploy a new strategy to production in 30 minutes instead of 3 days, that is your pipeline making it possible. When a pod's systems achieve 99.999% uptime during a volatile market session, that is your infrastructure keeping the revenue flowing. The pod model means every minute of downtime has a directly calculable PnL cost.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | PnL Participation | Total Comp |

| New York (HQ) | $175K - $225K | $90K - $140K | $50K - $90K | $315K - $455K |
| Miami | $165K - $215K | $85K - $130K | $45K - $80K | $295K - $425K |

#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at Millennium are the invisible backbone of a $60B+ fund's trading operations. You do not generate alpha directly, but you enable every single alpha-generating activity to happen reliably, quickly, and at scale. Your CI/CD pipelines deploy trading strategies to production. Your monitoring systems detect anomalies before they become losses. Your infrastructure automation ensures that when a pod needs to scale capacity for a market event, it happens in seconds, not hours. At Millennium, the pod model means every pod's PnL depends on the infrastructure reliability you provide. A 15-minute outage during market hours across 50 pods, with each pod averaging $500K in daily PnL, represents $520K in potential lost revenue. You are the insurance policy that prevents that — and your compensation should reflect the catastrophic risk you mitigate.

#### Pod Economics — The PnL Impact Multiplier

Millennium's Multi-Manager Pod structure creates a unique value proposition for DevOps Engineers: your work is a force multiplier across every pod in the fund. While a software engineer might be embedded in a single pod, your infrastructure supports dozens or hundreds of pods simultaneously. This cross-pod impact is your primary negotiation lever.

Top performers in pods earn **8-15% of their pod's annual PnL** on top of base and bonus. As a DevOps Engineer, you should **negotiate for a direct percentage of your pod's PnL as an Impact Multiplier** — but define "your pod" as the aggregate infrastructure impact across all pods your systems support.

DevOps-specific PnL economics:
- **Uptime = Revenue**: Calculate the PnL-per-minute across all pods your infrastructure supports. If 100 pods each generate $2K per trading minute and you maintain 99.99% uptime, your reliability prevents approximately $5.2M in annual PnL loss — that is your value floor
- **Deployment velocity**: Faster deployments mean pods can react to market changes faster. If your CI/CD pipeline reduces strategy deployment from 4 hours to 15 minutes, quantify the alpha captured in those reclaimed 3.75 hours per deployment
- **Target 2-3% blended PnL participation** across all pods supported by your infrastructure
- **Incident prevention premium**: Push for a bonus kicker tied to uptime metrics — e.g., additional 0.5% PnL participation for every quarter you maintain 99.99%+ uptime during market hours
- **Capacity scaling value**: When your infrastructure automation handles 3x volume spikes without degradation, the pod PnL captured during volatile markets is directly attributable to your capacity planning

#### Global Levers

1. **Uptime-to-PnL Translation**: "The infrastructure I would manage supports 85 pods with combined daily PnL of $42.5M. Each minute of downtime during market hours costs approximately $170K in aggregate pod PnL. My track record includes maintaining 99.997% uptime across comparable trading infrastructure — that represents approximately $1.3M in annual PnL protection. I am requesting 2.5% blended PnL participation across all pods supported by my infrastructure."

2. **Competing Infrastructure Offers**: "I have a competing offer from Citadel's SRE team at $210K base with a $130K guaranteed first-year bonus. Jump Trading has offered $200K base with $120K guaranteed. Both include reliability-linked performance bonuses. I need Millennium to be competitive at $215K base with $135K guaranteed bonus plus PnL participation terms."

3. **On-Call and Market Hours Premium**: "DevOps engineers at trading funds carry a unique on-call burden — market hours are non-negotiable and incidents must be resolved in minutes, not hours. I am requesting a $30K annual on-call premium on top of base salary, plus a $5K bonus for every quarter where zero market-hours incidents exceed 5 minutes resolution time. This aligns my incentives with pod PnL protection."

4. **Infrastructure Modernization ROI**: "I want to propose an infrastructure modernization initiative as part of my first-year objectives. Based on my assessment, migrating to containerized pod deployments will reduce deployment time by 70% and infrastructure costs by 35%. The deployment speed improvement alone represents an estimated $4M in incremental alpha capture across all pods. I am requesting a $50K project completion bonus tied to achieving these metrics."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $215K base with a $135K guaranteed first-year bonus. Lead with reliability economics — "my infrastructure will protect $42.5M in daily pod PnL across 85 pods." Present competing offers from Citadel ($210K + $130K) and Jump Trading ($200K + $120K). Demand 2.5% blended PnL participation across all pods supported by your infrastructure. Request a $30K annual on-call premium and a $50K infrastructure modernization completion bonus. Push for uptime-linked PnL participation escalators. **Accept at $190K+ base and $110K+ guaranteed bonus** with written blended PnL participation of at least 2%. Walk away below $175K base, below $90K guaranteed bonus, or if the role does not include cross-pod infrastructure scope.
