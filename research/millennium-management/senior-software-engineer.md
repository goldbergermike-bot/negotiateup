#### Compensation Overview

Millennium Management is a $60B+ multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Izzy Englander, built on a Multi-Manager Pod structure where each pod operates as a semi-autonomous trading team. Compensation is structured as Base + Bonus + PnL Percentage with no public equity — this is a private firm. Senior Software Engineers at Millennium occupy a critical leverage point: experienced enough to own entire systems within a pod, yet still hands-on enough to deliver measurable technical impact. The pod model makes individual contribution directly measurable, creating outsized negotiation leverage for engineers who can demonstrate quantifiable value.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | PnL Participation | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-------------------|------------|
| New York (HQ) | $225K - $295K | $140K - $220K | $90K - $150K | $455K - $665K |
| Miami | $215K - $280K | $130K - $200K | $80K - $135K | $425K - $615K |
| London (GBP/USD) | £170K - £220K / $215K - $279K | £105K - £165K / $133K - $209K | £65K - £110K / $82K - $139K | £340K - £495K / $430K - $627K |

#### Negotiation DNA

The Senior Software Engineer at Millennium is the workhorse of pod technology — the person who designs, builds, and maintains the systems that a trading pod relies on daily. You are not a junior contributor waiting for tickets; you are the engineer the portfolio manager calls when a strategy needs to go live by market open. At Millennium, this level represents the highest-leverage IC position for negotiation because you combine deep technical capability with direct pod integration. Your systems process orders, calculate risk, aggregate positions, and feed the analytics that drive trading decisions. When your system goes down, the pod stops making money. When your system is fast, the pod captures alpha others miss. This direct causal chain between your work and pod PnL is the foundation of every compensation conversation you will have.

#### Pod Economics — The PnL Impact Multiplier

Millennium's Multi-Manager Pod structure fundamentally changes the compensation equation for Senior Software Engineers. Unlike traditional firms where senior engineers negotiate against salary bands, at Millennium you negotiate against a percentage of directly measurable revenue.

Here is the math that matters: A typical pod at Millennium manages $500M-$2B in capital and targets 10-20% annual returns. A pod managing $1B that returns 15% generates $150M in PnL. Top performers in pods earn **8-15% of their pod's annual PnL** on top of base and bonus. As a Senior SWE, you should target **3-5% of your pod's net PnL** as your Impact Multiplier.

At 3% of a $150M PnL pod, that is $4.5M in additional compensation. Even at 3% of a more modest $30M PnL pod, you are looking at $900K on top of base and bonus. The negotiation imperative is clear: **negotiate for a direct percentage of your pod's PnL as an Impact Multiplier** rather than accepting discretionary bonus language.

Key leverage points for Senior SWEs:
- **System ownership**: You own critical path systems — quantify the revenue at risk if those systems fail or degrade
- **Latency impact**: Every microsecond you shave off execution time has a dollar value; calculate it and present it during negotiations
- **Pod dependency**: If the pod cannot function without your systems, your PnL percentage should reflect that criticality
- **Multi-pod contribution**: If your work serves multiple pods, negotiate a blended PnL percentage across all benefiting pods
- **Year-over-year escalation**: Push for automatic PnL percentage increases tied to pod performance milestones — e.g., PnL percentage increases from 3% to 4% when pod exceeds $50M annual PnL

#### Global Levers

1. **System Criticality Quantification**: "The order management system I would own processes $2B in daily notional volume across three strategies. A 1-hour outage costs the pod approximately $800K in missed opportunities based on historical analysis. My compensation should reflect the revenue protection and generation my work directly enables — I am targeting a 4% PnL participation rate."

2. **Competing Pod-Structure Offers**: "I have a competing offer from Citadel's Surveyor unit at $260K base with a $200K guaranteed first-year bonus and explicit PnL participation language. Point72 has also extended an offer at $250K base with a $180K guarantee. For me to choose Millennium, I need the base to be at or above $270K with a guaranteed bonus floor of $190K and PnL participation no lower than 3%."

3. **Guaranteed Compensation Bridge**: "My current total compensation including RSU vesting is $580K. Transitioning to a performance-linked model introduces variability. I am requesting a two-year guaranteed compensation floor of $500K annually — base plus guaranteed bonus — with PnL participation as upside. This ensures I am not taking a step backward while I build track record at Millennium."

4. **Pod Selection Rights**: "I want to discuss pod assignment as part of the offer negotiation. My preference is to join a pod with a trailing 3-year average PnL above $50M. I would also like the right to request a pod transfer after 18 months if my current pod underperforms, without forfeiting accumulated PnL participation rights."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $270K base with a $200K guaranteed first-year bonus. Present competing offers from Citadel ($260K + $200K) and Point72 ($250K + $180K). Demand explicit PnL participation — target 4% of pod PnL with a written floor of 3%. For a pod generating $50M annually, 4% equals $2M in additional comp, making your effective TC $2.47M. Request a $100K signing bonus to offset forgone RSU vesting from current employer. Push for a two-year guaranteed floor of $500K TC. **Accept at $250K+ base and $180K+ guaranteed bonus** with written PnL participation of at least 3%. Walk away below $240K base, below $160K guaranteed bonus, or if PnL participation is entirely discretionary with no stated percentage.
