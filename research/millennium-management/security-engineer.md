#### Compensation Overview

Millennium Management is a $60B+ multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Izzy Englander, operating under a Multi-Manager Pod structure where each pod functions as a semi-autonomous trading team. Compensation is Base + Bonus + PnL Percentage with no public equity. Security Engineers at Millennium protect the most valuable target in finance: the proprietary trading strategies, market data, and execution systems of a $60B+ fund. A security breach at Millennium is not a data privacy headline — it is the potential exposure of alpha-generating strategies worth billions, the compromise of trading systems handling billions in daily volume, or the theft of proprietary datasets that form the fund's competitive edge. Your role is existential protection, and your compensation should reflect the catastrophic risk you mitigate.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | PnL Participation | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-------------------|------------|
| New York (HQ) | $195K - $255K | $100K - $160K | $60K - $100K | $355K - $515K |
| Miami | $185K - $240K | $90K - $145K | $50K - $90K | $325K - $475K |
| London (GBP/USD) | £148K - £195K / $188K - $247K | £75K - £122K / $95K - $155K | £45K - £75K / $57K - $95K | £268K - £392K / $340K - $497K |

#### Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at Millennium guard the crown jewels of one of the world's most successful hedge funds. Each pod's trading strategy is a closely guarded secret worth millions in annual PnL — and you are responsible for ensuring that no adversary, insider, or system vulnerability compromises those strategies. The multi-pod structure adds complexity: 250+ semi-autonomous pods each have their own data, systems, and access patterns, creating a security surface area that dwarfs most enterprises. You must implement pod-level data isolation while enabling the cross-pod collaboration that Millennium's platform model requires. You must protect against nation-state level threats targeting the fund's proprietary data while enabling traders to move at the speed markets demand. This constant tension between security and speed, between isolation and collaboration, is what makes your role uniquely challenging and valuable.

#### Pod Economics — The PnL Impact Multiplier

Millennium's Multi-Manager Pod structure creates an extraordinary security challenge — and an equally extraordinary compensation opportunity. Each pod's trading strategy is independently valuable intellectual property, and your security work protects the aggregate value of all pods simultaneously.

Top performers in pods earn **8-15% of their pod's annual PnL** on top of base and bonus. As a Security Engineer, you should **negotiate for a direct percentage of your pod's PnL as an Impact Multiplier**, framing your PnL case around the catastrophic risk you prevent.

Security-specific PnL economics:
- **Strategy protection value**: If a pod's trading strategy generates $50M annually and your security prevents its exposure to competitors, the full $50M in ongoing PnL is protected by your work. Across 250 pods, the aggregate strategy value you protect runs into the billions
- **Target 2-3.5% blended PnL participation** across all pods protected by your security infrastructure
- **Incident prevention ROI**: A single security breach at a fund like Millennium could cost $100M-$500M in direct losses, regulatory fines, and strategy compromise. Your prevention of such an event has a clear expected value
- **Pod isolation architecture**: Your design of inter-pod data isolation — ensuring Pod A cannot access Pod B's strategy data — is a fundamental enabler of the pod model itself. Without this security architecture, the multi-manager structure cannot function
- **Compliance enablement**: Your security work enables Millennium to pass regulatory audits and maintain trading licenses across all jurisdictions — this is a binary enabler of all pod PnL

#### Global Levers

1. **Catastrophic Risk Prevention Value**: "A security breach at Millennium would expose proprietary trading strategies across 250+ pods with combined annual PnL exceeding $5B. The expected cost of a major breach — including strategy exposure, regulatory fines, and reputational damage — is estimated at $200M-$500M. My security engineering work reduces the probability of such an event by an estimated 40%. The expected value of this risk reduction is $80M-$200M annually. I am requesting 3% blended PnL participation as an Impact Multiplier across the security perimeter I protect."

2. **Competing Security Offers**: "I have a competing offer from Citadel's security engineering team at $235K base with a $145K guaranteed first-year bonus. Two Sigma has offered $240K base with $140K guaranteed. Both firms recognize that security engineers with hedge fund trading infrastructure experience command a premium. I need Millennium at $245K base with $150K guaranteed bonus plus PnL participation."

3. **Security Clearance and Specialized Skills Premium**: "My background includes nation-state threat intelligence work and advanced offensive security certifications (OSCP, OSCE, GXPN). This specialized threat landscape expertise is relevant because multi-manager hedge funds are high-priority targets for state-sponsored cyber operations seeking trading strategy intelligence. I am requesting a $60K signing bonus reflecting the rarity of this combined skillset and a 0.5% premium on PnL participation rate."

4. **Pod Isolation Architecture Value**: "Designing and maintaining the data isolation framework between 250+ pods is the foundational security requirement of Millennium's business model. Without cryptographically enforced pod boundaries, the multi-manager structure cannot function — PMs would never join knowing competitors within the same fund could access their strategies. I want my compensation to reflect this structural importance. I am requesting an additional $25K annually as a pod isolation architecture premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $245K base with a $150K guaranteed first-year bonus. Frame your value through catastrophic risk prevention — "my work protects $5B+ in aggregate pod PnL from security compromise." Present competing offers from Citadel ($235K + $145K) and Two Sigma ($240K + $140K). Demand 3% blended PnL participation across all pods protected by your security infrastructure. Request a $60K signing bonus for specialized threat intelligence experience. Push for a $25K annual pod isolation architecture premium. **Accept at $220K+ base and $130K+ guaranteed bonus** with written blended PnL participation of at least 2.5%. Walk away below $195K base, below $100K guaranteed bonus, or if the role is limited to compliance-driven security without offensive security or threat hunting scope.
