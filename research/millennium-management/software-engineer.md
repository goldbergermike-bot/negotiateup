#### Compensation Overview

Millennium Management is a $60B+ multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Izzy Englander, operating under a Multi-Manager Pod structure where each pod functions as a semi-autonomous trading team. As a private firm, compensation follows a Base + Bonus + PnL Percentage model with no public equity component. Software Engineers at Millennium build the technology backbone that powers individual pod strategies, and because individual contribution is directly measurable within the pod model, engineers have unique negotiation leverage that does not exist at traditional tech firms.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | PnL Participation | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-------------------|------------|
| New York (HQ) | $175K - $225K | $90K - $140K | $50K - $90K | $315K - $455K |
| Miami | $165K - $215K | $85K - $130K | $45K - $80K | $295K - $425K |
| London (GBP/USD) | £130K - £170K / $165K - $215K | £65K - £100K / $82K - $127K | £35K - £65K / $44K - $82K | £230K - £335K / $291K - $424K |

#### Negotiation DNA

Software Engineers at Millennium are not writing code in a vacuum — they are embedded within or directly supporting trading pods that generate measurable PnL. This creates a compensation dynamic fundamentally different from Big Tech. Your code does not ship to millions of users for engagement metrics; it executes trades, manages risk, and processes market data in real time. Every millisecond of latency you eliminate, every system you make more reliable, has a direct dollar value attached to it. Millennium's pod model means your manager — often a portfolio manager — can see exactly how your work impacts the pod's bottom line. This is your negotiation superpower.

#### Pod Economics — The PnL Impact Multiplier

Millennium's Multi-Manager Pod structure is the single most important factor in your compensation negotiation. Here is how it works:

Each pod at Millennium operates as a semi-autonomous trading team with its own PnL. Unlike a traditional tech company where engineering is a cost center, at Millennium your engineering work directly enables a pod's revenue generation. Top performers in pods can earn **8-15% of their pod's annual PnL** on top of base and bonus.

For a Software Engineer, PnL participation typically starts at the lower end — around 1-3% of your pod's net PnL — but even modest pods generating $20M-$50M annually make this a meaningful $200K-$1.5M variable on top of base compensation. The key negotiation move is to **negotiate for a direct percentage of your pod's PnL as an "Impact Multiplier"** rather than accepting a flat discretionary bonus.

What makes this uniquely powerful:
- **Direct attribution**: Your code's impact on pod performance is measurable — latency improvements, uptime, strategy implementation speed all translate to dollars
- **Compounding leverage**: As you prove your value to a pod, your PnL percentage should increase year over year
- **Pod selection matters**: Negotiate not just your percentage but which pod you join — a 2% share of a $100M PnL pod vastly outperforms 5% of a $10M pod
- **Ratchet protection**: Push for a clause that prevents your PnL percentage from decreasing if the pod has a down year

#### Global Levers

1. **Pod Assignment Leverage**: "I want to understand which pod I would be supporting and what their trailing 3-year PnL has been. My compensation expectations are calibrated to a pod generating $30M+ annually, and I would like my PnL participation percentage reflected in writing as part of my offer."

2. **Competing Multi-Manager Offers**: "I am currently in discussions with Citadel Securities and Point72 for comparable pod-embedded engineering roles. Citadel has indicated a base of $195K with a guaranteed first-year bonus of $120K. I would need Millennium to be competitive on guaranteed compensation while also offering superior PnL participation terms."

3. **Signing Bonus as Risk Mitigation**: "Given that PnL participation has inherent variability, I am requesting a $75K signing bonus to bridge the first-year uncertainty. This is standard when transitioning from guaranteed Big Tech RSU vesting schedules to performance-linked fund compensation."

4. **Relocation and Office Premium**: "For the New York headquarters role, I am factoring in the cost-of-living differential. I would like to discuss either a $50K relocation package or a housing stipend for the first 18 months to ensure my effective take-home is competitive with my current Bay Area compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $200K base and $130K guaranteed first-year bonus. Lead with competing offers from Citadel ($195K base + $120K bonus) or Point72 ($185K base + $110K bonus). Push for explicit PnL participation language — request 2% of pod PnL with annual renegotiation rights. If the pod you are assigned to generated $40M last year, that 2% is $800K in additional comp. Request a $75K signing bonus citing forgone RSU vesting. **Accept at $185K+ base and $100K+ guaranteed bonus** with written PnL participation terms. Walk away below $175K base or if PnL participation is described as "discretionary" without a stated floor percentage.
