#### Compensation Overview

Millennium Management is a $60B+ multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Izzy Englander, operating under a Multi-Manager Pod structure where each pod functions as a semi-autonomous trading team. As a private firm, compensation is Base + Bonus + PnL Percentage with no public equity. Engineering Managers at Millennium sit at the intersection of people leadership and pod technology strategy — you own the engineering headcount, velocity, and technical direction that directly determines how effectively pods can deploy capital. Your team's output is measured not in sprint points but in pod PnL, giving you a negotiation position that most engineering managers at tech companies never experience.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | PnL Participation | Total Comp |

| New York (HQ) | $275K - $365K | $175K - $270K | $115K - $180K | $565K - $815K |

#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at Millennium do not manage teams building consumer products or SaaS platforms — they lead engineering organizations that directly support multi-billion-dollar trading operations. Your team builds the execution systems, risk engines, market data platforms, and analytics tools that pods use to generate alpha. The Multi-Manager Pod structure means your management decisions have direct financial consequences: hiring the right engineer can unlock a new strategy for a pod; a slow hiring process can cost a pod millions in missed market opportunities. You are evaluated not by uptime SLAs or feature velocity but by the revenue your engineering organization enables. This direct line from your leadership to fund PnL is the foundation of your compensation negotiation. You should frame yourself not as a cost-center manager but as a revenue-enabling leader whose team generates measurable returns.

#### Pod Economics — The PnL Impact Multiplier

As an Engineering Manager, Millennium's Multi-Manager Pod structure creates a unique compensation dynamic: you manage the team whose output directly determines pod PnL. This is not abstract — every hiring decision, architecture choice, and sprint priority you set has a dollar-denominated impact on pod revenue.

Here is the leverage: Top performers in pods earn **8-15% of their pod's annual PnL** on top of base and bonus. As an Engineering Manager, your PnL participation should reflect the aggregate impact of your entire team, not just your individual contribution. **Negotiate for a direct percentage of your pod's PnL as an Impact Multiplier** — and frame that percentage as reflecting the multiplied output of the 6-15 engineers you manage.

The math for Engineering Managers:
- **Team output multiplier**: If you manage 10 engineers whose combined work enables a pod generating $80M in annual PnL, your management effectiveness is responsible for a significant portion of that output
- **Target 4-6% of pod PnL**: Higher than individual contributors because you own the team's collective output
- **Hiring leverage**: Frame every new hire you make as an incremental PnL generator — "each engineer I hire generates an estimated $2M-$5M in incremental pod PnL capacity"
- **Retention value**: The cost of losing a pod-embedded engineer is 6-12 months of disrupted pod operations — quantify this when negotiating your retention and PnL terms
- **Cross-pod management**: If your team serves multiple pods, negotiate blended PnL participation similar to Staff engineers

#### Global Levers

1. **Team Revenue Attribution**: "My team of 12 engineers supports three pods with combined trailing PnL of $180M. Based on technology-attributed alpha analysis, approximately 25% of that PnL — $45M — is directly enabled by the systems my team builds and maintains. I am requesting 5% PnL participation on the technology-attributed portion, which represents $2.25M annually. This is appropriate given that I own the hiring, retention, and technical direction of the team generating that impact."

2. **Competing Management Offers**: "I have a competing offer from Citadel for an Engineering Manager role at $320K base with a $240K guaranteed first-year bonus. Point72 has offered $300K base with $220K guaranteed. Both include explicit PnL participation language. For Millennium, I am targeting $340K base with $250K guaranteed and PnL participation terms that reflect my team's cross-pod impact."

3. **Headcount Authority as Compensation Lever**: "I want to negotiate my headcount authority as part of the compensation package. Each engineer I hire generates incremental pod PnL capacity. I am requesting authority to hire up to 5 additional engineers in the first 18 months, with my PnL participation percentage applied to the incremental PnL those hires generate. This aligns my incentives with fund growth."

4. **Management Premium Over IC Track**: "The management track at Millennium carries additional responsibilities — people management, hiring, cross-pod coordination, vendor management — that the IC track does not. I expect a 15-20% management premium over equivalent-level Staff Engineers. If a Staff Engineer at Millennium earns $750K TC, my expectation is $860K-$900K TC with a higher guaranteed component to reflect the operational stability my role provides."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $340K base with a $250K guaranteed first-year bonus. Frame your value through the lens of team output — "I manage the team that enables $180M in annual pod PnL." Present competing offers from Citadel ($320K + $240K) and Point72 ($300K + $220K). Demand 5% PnL participation on technology-attributed pod PnL across all pods your team serves. Request headcount authority for 5 new hires with your PnL percentage applied to incremental output. Push for a $125K signing bonus citing management stability premium. **Accept at $300K+ base and $220K+ guaranteed bonus** with written PnL participation of at least 4% on technology-attributed PnL. Walk away below $275K base, below $175K guaranteed bonus, or if PnL participation language is purely discretionary.
