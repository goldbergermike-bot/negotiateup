#### Compensation Overview (+15-25% AI/Quant Premium)

Millennium Management is a $60B+ multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Izzy Englander, operating under a Multi-Manager Pod structure where each pod functions as a semi-autonomous trading team. Compensation follows a Base + Bonus + PnL Percentage structure with no public equity. ML/AI Engineers command a **+15-25% AI/Quant Premium** over standard engineering roles, reflecting the direct alpha-generation potential of machine learning models in trading. At Millennium, your models do not optimize ad clicks or recommend products — they predict market movements, identify trading opportunities, and generate signals that pods use to deploy billions in capital. The pod model means every model you deploy has a directly measurable PnL impact, and the best ML engineers are among the highest-compensated non-trading professionals at the fund.

| New York (HQ) | $255K - $340K | $145K - $230K | $90K - $145K | $490K - $715K |
| Miami | $240K - $320K | $135K - $210K | $80K - $130K | $455K - $660K |

#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at Millennium are the closest non-trading professionals to direct alpha generation. Your machine learning models ingest massive datasets — market microstructure data, alternative data, satellite imagery, NLP-processed news feeds — and produce trading signals that portfolio managers use to make capital allocation decisions. When your model identifies a signal with a Sharpe ratio above 2.0, that signal can generate tens of millions in pod PnL. When your NLP system processes earnings calls faster than competitors, pods capture information edge worth millions. The +15-25% AI/Quant Premium reflects the reality that ML/AI engineers who can build production-grade trading models are among the scarcest and most valuable professionals in quantitative finance. Your negotiation should center on the direct alpha-generation potential of your models and the scarcity of your combined ML expertise and financial domain knowledge.

#### Pod Economics — The PnL Impact Multiplier

Millennium's Multi-Manager Pod structure creates the ideal environment for ML/AI Engineers to maximize compensation: your models generate directly measurable trading signals, and the pod structure ensures that the PnL those signals generate is precisely attributable to your work.

Top performers in pods earn **8-15% of their pod's annual PnL** on top of base and bonus. As an ML/AI Engineer, you should **negotiate for a direct percentage of your pod's PnL as an Impact Multiplier** — and with the AI/Quant Premium, your PnL participation rate should reflect the outsized alpha-generation potential of your models.

ML/AI-specific PnL economics:
- **Model-to-PnL attribution**: Every model you deploy to production has a trackable PnL contribution through Millennium's attribution system. If your sentiment analysis model contributes to $30M in pod PnL, that contribution is recorded and should inform your PnL participation
- **Target 4-7% PnL participation**: ML/AI engineers who produce live trading signals warrant the highest PnL participation among non-trading technology roles, reflecting the direct alpha generation nature of the work
- **Signal portfolio value**: Negotiate PnL participation across all signals from your models that go live, not just your primary assignment. A prolific ML engineer might have 5-10 signals deployed across multiple pods
- **Research-to-production premium**: Push for a bonus kicker when your models successfully transition from research to live trading — this is the highest-value event in quantitative finance
- **Compute budget as leverage**: Your model performance is directly tied to compute resources. Negotiate a dedicated GPU/TPU cluster budget as part of your offer — this is a force multiplier on your PnL contribution

#### Global Levers

1. **Alpha Generation Track Record**: "My ML models have generated a cumulative $45M in live PnL over 4 years at my current fund, with a live Sharpe ratio of 2.3 and maximum drawdown of 4.2%. I am requesting 6% PnL participation on all pods deploying signals from my models. Based on a conservative first-year estimate of $25M in model-attributed PnL, this represents $1.5M in PnL compensation — plus my base and guaranteed bonus."

2. **AI Talent Scarcity Premium**: "ML engineers with proven production trading signal experience are among the rarest professionals in quantitative finance. I have competing offers from Citadel Quantitative Research at $310K base with a $210K guaranteed bonus, Two Sigma at $325K with $200K guaranteed, and DE Shaw at $300K with $225K guaranteed. All include explicit signal-level PnL attribution. For Millennium, I am targeting $330K base with a $220K guaranteed bonus and PnL participation terms that exceed competitors."

3. **Research Infrastructure Investment**: "My model performance is directly correlated with compute resources. I am requesting a dedicated annual compute budget of $2M for GPU clusters, with the understanding that each dollar of compute investment generates an estimated 20-50x return in model-attributed PnL. This should be negotiated as part of my offer, not treated as a separate budget request."

4. **IP and Model Portability Protection**: "My models represent years of research investment. I want to negotiate clear terms around model IP: specifically, that I retain knowledge of general ML techniques and approaches (but not Millennium-specific data or strategies) if I depart, and that my non-compete period is compensated at my full TC rate for its duration. I also want a $90K signing bonus reflecting the IP value of my research approach that I bring to Millennium from day one."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $330K base with a $220K guaranteed first-year bonus. Lead with your alpha generation track record — "my models have generated $45M in cumulative live PnL with a 2.3 Sharpe ratio." Present competing offers from Citadel ($310K + $210K), Two Sigma ($325K + $200K), and DE Shaw ($300K + $225K). Demand 6% PnL participation on all pods deploying your signals, with signal-level attribution tracking. Request a $2M annual compute budget and a $90K signing bonus. Push for compensated non-compete terms at full TC rate. **Accept at $290K+ base and $190K+ guaranteed bonus** with written PnL participation of at least 4% and signal-level attribution. Walk away below $255K base, below $145K guaranteed bonus, or if the role does not include direct model-to-production deployment authority.
