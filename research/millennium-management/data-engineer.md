#### Compensation Overview

Millennium Management is a $60B+ multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Izzy Englander, operating under a Multi-Manager Pod structure where each pod functions as a semi-autonomous trading team. Compensation is Base + Bonus + PnL Percentage with no public equity. Data Engineers at Millennium build and maintain the data pipelines, storage systems, and processing frameworks that transform raw market data, alternative data, and internal trading data into the signals and analytics that pods use to trade. You are the plumbing of a $60B+ fund — and in trading, the quality and speed of data plumbing determines the quality and speed of alpha generation. Every pod depends on your data infrastructure to function.

#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at Millennium operate at the intersection of two powerful forces: the explosion of available data and the insatiable demand from trading pods for faster, richer, more reliable data. You do not build data pipelines for business intelligence dashboards or marketing analytics — you build the data infrastructure that feeds trading strategies managing billions in capital. When your pipeline delivers tick data 100 milliseconds faster, pods capture alpha that competitors miss. When your alternative data integration surfaces a new dataset, pods gain informational edge. When your data quality monitoring catches a corrupt feed before it reaches a trading algorithm, you prevent losses that could reach millions. This direct causal chain between your data engineering work and pod PnL is your negotiation foundation.

#### Pod Economics — The PnL Impact Multiplier

Millennium's Multi-Manager Pod structure means Data Engineers serve as the central nervous system of the fund — every pod receives data through your pipelines, and the quality, speed, and reliability of that data directly determines pod trading performance.

Top performers in pods earn **8-15% of their pod's annual PnL** on top of base and bonus. As a Data Engineer, you should **negotiate for a direct percentage of your pod's PnL as an Impact Multiplier**, framing your PnL contribution around the data infrastructure that enables all pod trading activity.

Data Engineering PnL economics:
- **Data velocity = Alpha capture**: If your pipeline delivers market data 50 milliseconds faster to 100 pods, and each pod executes 500 trades daily with an average edge of $50 per microsecond saved, the aggregate PnL impact is measurable in millions annually
- **Target 2.5-4% blended PnL participation** across all pods consuming data from your pipelines
- **Alternative data integration value**: Each new alternative dataset you integrate gives pods new potential alpha signals. If a dataset you onboard leads to $10M in pod PnL, claim data integration PnL credit
- **Data quality as PnL protection**: Bad data fed to trading algorithms causes losses. Your data validation and quality monitoring directly prevents PnL destruction — quantify the expected value of prevented bad-data incidents
- **Storage and compute efficiency**: If your data architecture reduces compute costs by $3M annually while improving query performance by 5x, both the savings and the speed improvement have direct PnL value

#### Global Levers

1. **Data Infrastructure Impact**: "The market data pipeline I would own processes 2 billion messages daily and serves 120 pods. Reducing processing latency by 30% — achievable based on my experience with comparable systems at scale — generates an estimated $8M in incremental alpha capture across those pods. I am requesting 3% blended PnL participation across all pods served by my data infrastructure."

2. **Competing Data Engineering Offers**: "I have a competing offer from Citadel's data engineering team at $235K base with a $145K guaranteed first-year bonus. Two Sigma has offered $240K with $140K guaranteed. Jane Street is at $230K with a $155K guarantee. I need Millennium at $245K base with $150K guaranteed bonus, plus PnL participation terms that reflect the cross-pod nature of my data infrastructure."

3. **Alternative Data Expertise Premium**: "My experience includes integrating 50+ alternative data sources — satellite imagery, web scraping, credit card transactions, social media sentiment — into trading-ready pipelines. Each alternative data source I integrate creates potential alpha for every pod that consumes it. This alternative data integration expertise warrants a $55K signing bonus and an additional 0.5% PnL participation premium on pods that deploy strategies using alternative data I integrate."

4. **Data Platform Ownership**: "I want to negotiate ownership of the data platform roadmap, including vendor selection for data storage, processing frameworks, and data quality tools. Each vendor decision has multi-million-dollar cost implications over 3-5 years. I am requesting a $40K annual platform ownership premium and authority to evaluate and select data technology vendors, with PnL credit for cost savings achieved through better vendor selection."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $245K base with a $150K guaranteed first-year bonus. Frame your value through data infrastructure scale — "my pipelines process 2B+ daily messages serving 120 pods." Present competing offers from Citadel ($235K + $145K), Two Sigma ($240K + $140K), and Jane Street ($230K + $155K). Demand 3% blended PnL participation across all pods consuming your data pipelines. Request a $55K signing bonus for alternative data integration expertise. Push for data platform roadmap ownership with associated PnL credit. **Accept at $220K+ base and $130K+ guaranteed bonus** with written blended PnL participation of at least 2.5%. Walk away below $195K base, below $100K guaranteed bonus, or if the role is limited to single-pipeline maintenance rather than cross-pod data platform ownership.
