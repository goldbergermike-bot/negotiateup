#### Compensation Overview

Millennium Management is a $60B+ multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Izzy Englander, operating under a Multi-Manager Pod structure where each pod functions as a semi-autonomous trading team. Compensation is Base + Bonus + PnL Percentage — no public equity as this is a private firm. Data Scientists at Millennium are not analyzing user behavior or building recommendation engines — they are mining financial datasets, building predictive models, and generating trading signals that pods use to allocate capital. Your statistical models directly influence trading decisions worth billions. The pod structure means every alpha signal you generate has a directly measurable PnL impact, creating negotiation leverage that data scientists at tech companies simply do not have.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | PnL Participation | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-------------------|------------|
| New York (HQ) | $215K - $285K | $120K - $195K | $80K - $125K | $415K - $605K |
| Miami | $200K - $265K | $110K - $180K | $70K - $110K | $380K - $555K |
| London (GBP/USD) | £165K - £215K / $209K - $273K | £90K - £148K / $114K - $188K | £58K - £95K / $73K - $120K | £313K - £458K / $396K - $581K |

#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at Millennium sit at the core of the alpha generation engine. You analyze alternative data, build statistical models, test hypotheses about market behavior, and generate signals that portfolio managers use to make trading decisions. Unlike a data scientist at a tech company optimizing click-through rates, your work directly generates or protects revenue in the hundreds of millions. When your model identifies a signal that generates $10M in PnL for a pod, that contribution is directly traceable to your work. When your risk model prevents a $20M drawdown, the saved capital is quantifiable. This direct causal link between your analytical work and pod PnL is the most powerful negotiation lever available to any data science role in the industry.

#### Pod Economics — The PnL Impact Multiplier

Millennium's Multi-Manager Pod structure makes the Data Scientist role one of the most directly PnL-linked non-trading positions at the fund. Your models, signals, and analytical insights feed directly into trading decisions, and the pod structure ensures that your contribution to PnL is not diluted across a sprawling organization — it is directly attributable.

Top performers in pods earn **8-15% of their pod's annual PnL** on top of base and bonus. As a Data Scientist, you should **negotiate for a direct percentage of your pod's PnL as an Impact Multiplier**, anchoring your case on the alpha your research generates and the risk your models mitigate.

Data Science PnL economics at Millennium:
- **Signal value attribution**: If your alternative data model generates a signal that contributes to $15M in pod PnL, push for direct PnL credit on that signal's performance — this is trackable in Millennium's PnL attribution systems
- **Target 3-5% PnL participation**: Data Scientists who generate alpha-producing signals are among the highest-PnL-participation non-trading roles
- **Research portfolio approach**: Negotiate PnL participation across a portfolio of signals you generate, not just individual models — this smooths variance and rewards consistent research productivity
- **Backtesting-to-live premium**: Push for a bonus kicker when your backtested models successfully transition to live trading and generate PnL — this incentivizes practically deployable research over theoretical elegance
- **Data procurement authority**: Negotiate the budget authority to acquire alternative datasets — your ability to generate alpha is directly limited by data access, so framing data budget as a PnL investment strengthens your position

#### Global Levers

1. **Alpha Signal Attribution**: "My research pipeline has historically produced 4-6 live trading signals per year, with an average Sharpe ratio of 1.8 and cumulative PnL contribution of $25M over 3 years at my current fund. I am requesting 4% PnL participation on all pods that deploy signals from my research, with attribution tracked through Millennium's PnL system. Based on a conservative estimate of $20M in first-year signal-attributed PnL, this represents $800K in PnL compensation alone."

2. **Competing Quantitative Offers**: "I have a competing offer from Citadel's quantitative research group at $260K base with a $180K guaranteed first-year bonus and explicit signal-level PnL attribution. Two Sigma has offered $270K base with $170K guaranteed. DE Shaw is at $265K with a $190K guarantee. For Millennium, I am targeting $275K base with a $185K guaranteed bonus and PnL participation terms that exceed what Citadel is offering."

3. **Alternative Data Budget as Compensation**: "My research effectiveness is directly proportional to data access. I am requesting a $500K annual alternative data procurement budget allocated to my research, in addition to my compensation package. Each dollar spent on quality alternative data generates an estimated 10-50x return in signal-attributed PnL. Frame this not as a cost but as a capital allocation to my research pod."

4. **Research Exclusivity Premium**: "My research specialization — high-frequency alternative data integration for systematic macro strategies — is practiced by fewer than 100 professionals globally. This scarcity commands a premium. I am requesting a $80K signing bonus reflecting the rarity of this skillset, plus a 12-month non-compete buyout clause guaranteeing my guaranteed compensation continues for 12 months if Millennium terminates my position."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $275K base with a $185K guaranteed first-year bonus. Lead with alpha generation track record — "my signals have generated $25M in cumulative PnL over 3 years." Present competing offers from Citadel ($260K + $180K), Two Sigma ($270K + $170K), and DE Shaw ($265K + $190K). Demand 4% PnL participation on all pods deploying your signals, with signal-level attribution tracking. Request a $500K annual alternative data procurement budget. Push for an $80K signing bonus reflecting research specialization scarcity. **Accept at $240K+ base and $155K+ guaranteed bonus** with written PnL participation of at least 3% and signal-level attribution. Walk away below $215K base, below $120K guaranteed bonus, or if the role does not include direct pod interaction for signal deployment.
