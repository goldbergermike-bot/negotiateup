### Security Engineer | CoreWeave Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + High Base | GPU Cloud Infrastructure | HPC Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / Roseland NJ | $195K-$242K | $210K-$368K | — | $248K-$334K |
| Remote US | $187K-$234K | $210K-$368K | — | $240K-$326K |
| London | £147K-£182K | £158K-£277K | — | £187K-£252K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at CoreWeave protect the GPU cloud platform that frontier AI labs and enterprise customers trust with their most sensitive workloads — from proprietary model weights and training data to confidential research infrastructure. This is not standard cloud security: CoreWeave's multi-tenant GPU cloud requires securing GPU memory isolation between customers, protecting against side-channel attacks on shared GPU hardware, ensuring compliance with enterprise security frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA), and building the zero-trust networking architecture that spans thousands of GPUs connected via InfiniBand. With CoreWeave's IPO approaching, security maturity is a prerequisite for enterprise customer acquisition and public market credibility. The $248K-$334K TC range reflects the premium CoreWeave pays for security engineers who understand GPU cloud-specific threat models.

**Level Mapping:** CoreWeave Security Engineer = Google L4 Security Engineer = AWS Security Engineer III = Meta E4 Security Engineer = Apple Security ICT3

**HPC Premium — $295K Average TC, $420K+ Top 10%**
CoreWeave's average total compensation is $295K — but the top 10% earn $420K+. Push for "Tier 1" equity grants that put you in the top decile. CoreWeave pays an HPC (High-Performance Computing) premium because GPU cloud infrastructure requires rare expertise that most cloud engineers don't have: GPU cluster networking (NVLink, NVSwitch), InfiniBand fabrics, large-scale distributed computing, and the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of GPUs. When negotiating, frame it as: "CoreWeave's $295K average TC is the floor, not my target. I bring [specific HPC/GPU expertise] that puts me in the top 10% — the $420K+ tier. My equity grant should be Tier 1, reflecting that my expertise directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue." With IPO on the horizon, Tier 1 equity grants carry massive near-term upside. As a Security Engineer, your HPC premium comes from expertise in GPU cloud security — multi-tenant GPU memory isolation, InfiniBand network security, side-channel attack mitigation on shared GPU hardware, and the compliance frameworks that enterprise customers require before deploying on CoreWeave. Security engineers who understand GPU-specific threat vectors are extraordinarily rare, and a single security incident could derail CoreWeave's IPO. That risk mitigation value should be reflected in a Tier 1 equity grant.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity — IPO Security Prerequisite:** "Enterprise customers and public market investors both require security maturity before committing. A SOC 2 gap or a GPU isolation vulnerability could cost CoreWeave enterprise deals worth tens of millions or delay the IPO. My security work is a prerequisite for CoreWeave's revenue growth and IPO success — that risk mitigation value justifies a Tier 1 equity grant of $350K+/4yr."
2. **GPU Cloud Security Scarcity:** "Security Engineers who understand multi-tenant GPU cloud threat models are exceptionally rare. Most cloud security engineers work with CPU-based workloads — I have experience with [GPU memory isolation/InfiniBand network security/side-channel attack mitigation/AI model security] at [previous company], and I understand the unique attack surfaces of shared GPU infrastructure. This expertise commands a significant HPC premium."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a Security Engineering offer from [Google/AWS/NVIDIA] at $350K TC with liquid public equity and a proven refresh cycle. CoreWeave's pre-IPO equity is illiquid, and the security stakes at a GPU cloud company are higher — protecting customer model weights and training data is mission-critical. I'm targeting $325K+ TC with a $360K/4yr equity grant."
4. **Enterprise Compliance Revenue Unlock:** "Every enterprise compliance framework I implement (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA, FedRAMP) unlocks an entirely new customer segment for CoreWeave. If I drive FedRAMP certification, that opens government AI contracts worth potentially hundreds of millions. I'd like to discuss tying my Year 2 refresh to compliance milestone achievement and the revenue those certifications unlock."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "CoreWeave's security challenge is uniquely complex — multi-tenant GPU isolation, InfiniBand network security, protecting customer model weights, and building the compliance posture required for IPO and enterprise customers. This is exactly the kind of security engineering I specialize in. I have a competing offer from [Google Cloud/AWS] at $340K TC with liquid equity. To move to CoreWeave pre-IPO, I need the package to reflect the illiquidity risk, the security criticality, and my GPU cloud security expertise. I'm targeting $325K TC — a base of $235K with a Tier 1 equity grant of $360K/4yr. I've built [multi-tenant isolation/compliance frameworks/zero-trust architectures] at [previous company] for [GPU/cloud infrastructure], and I understand the GPU-specific threat models that CoreWeave needs to address before IPO. My accept-at floor is $295K TC with a base of $218K and equity of $310K/4yr. I'd also want a guaranteed Year 2 refresh tied to compliance milestones. Below $295K, the risk math doesn't work versus a liquid public company offer."
