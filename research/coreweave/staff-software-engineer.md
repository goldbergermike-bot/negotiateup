### Staff Software Engineer | CoreWeave Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + High Base | GPU Cloud Infrastructure | HPC Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / Roseland NJ | $245K-$305K | $385K-$672K | — | $341K-$473K |
| Remote US | $235K-$296K | $385K-$672K | — | $331K-$464K |
| London | £184K-£230K | £290K-£506K | — | £257K-£357K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Staff Software Engineers at CoreWeave are the technical pillars who define the architecture of the GPU cloud platform — from designing the distributed scheduling system that allocates thousands of NVIDIA H100s and B200s to building the networking abstractions over NVLink and InfiniBand that make multi-node GPU training seamless. At this level, you are making decisions that directly impact CoreWeave's competitive moat against AWS, GCP, and Azure. With $35B+ valuation and IPO imminent, the $341K-$473K TC range represents massive wealth-creation potential, particularly if you negotiate a Tier 1 equity grant at the top of the $385K-$672K band.

**Level Mapping:** CoreWeave Staff SWE = Google L5 = AWS Principal SWE = Meta E5 = Apple ICT4 = Microsoft 64-65

**HPC Premium — $295K Average TC, $420K+ Top 10%**
CoreWeave's average total compensation is $295K — but the top 10% earn $420K+. Push for "Tier 1" equity grants that put you in the top decile. CoreWeave pays an HPC (High-Performance Computing) premium because GPU cloud infrastructure requires rare expertise that most cloud engineers don't have: GPU cluster networking (NVLink, NVSwitch), InfiniBand fabrics, large-scale distributed computing, and the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of GPUs. When negotiating, frame it as: "CoreWeave's $295K average TC is the floor, not my target. I bring [specific HPC/GPU expertise] that puts me in the top 10% — the $420K+ tier. My equity grant should be Tier 1, reflecting that my expertise directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue." With IPO on the horizon, Tier 1 equity grants carry massive near-term upside. As a Staff Engineer, you should already be well above the $295K average — your target is the $420K+ top decile. Frame your negotiation around the architectural decisions you'll make that determine whether CoreWeave's GPU cloud platform can scale to meet demand from frontier AI labs. A single architectural choice at this level can unlock or destroy millions in revenue.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization — Tier 1 Grant:** "At the Staff level, I expect a Tier 1 equity grant — $600K+/4yr — that reflects my architectural impact on the GPU cloud platform. Staff Engineers define the systems that either scale to meet demand or become bottlenecks. My work on [specific distributed system/GPU orchestration/large-scale Kubernetes] directly maps to the core technical challenges CoreWeave faces. I'm optimizing for equity exposure given the IPO timeline."
2. **Architectural Impact Quantification:** "In my current role, I architected [specific system] that handles [scale: e.g., 10K+ GPU scheduling decisions/sec, petabytes of data, millions of API calls]. That system directly generated $[X]M in revenue/savings. At CoreWeave, I'll be making equivalent architectural decisions for the GPU cloud platform — the equity grant should reflect that I'm a revenue multiplier, not a cost center."
3. **Competing Offer at Principal/Staff Level:** "I'm holding a Staff/L5 offer from [Google/Meta/NVIDIA] at $520K TC with liquid public equity and a guaranteed refresh. CoreWeave's pre-IPO equity requires a significant premium to reach risk-adjusted parity. I'm targeting $450K+ TC with a $650K/4yr equity grant. The IPO upside makes this a fair trade if the grant is Tier 1."
4. **Double-Trigger Acceleration & Signing Bonus:** "At the Staff level, I need downside protection. I'm requesting double-trigger acceleration — if CoreWeave is acquired or I'm terminated without cause within 12 months of IPO, 100% of unvested shares accelerate. I'd also like a $50K signing bonus to offset the opportunity cost of leaving [current role] where I have unvested equity worth $[X]."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "CoreWeave is building the most important GPU cloud infrastructure in the world right now — the NVIDIA partnership, the Microsoft contract, the frontier AI lab customers — this is where I want to make my architectural mark. I'm currently at [Google L5/Meta E5/NVIDIA Staff] with $490K TC in liquid public equity, plus $200K in unvested RSUs I'd be walking away from. To make this move, I need a package that reflects both the forfeited compensation and the illiquidity risk. I'm targeting $450K TC — a base of $285K with a Tier 1 equity grant of $660K/4yr. That puts me firmly in the $420K+ top decile, which is where a Staff Engineer with my background in [GPU-aware distributed systems/large-scale Kubernetes/HPC networking] belongs. I'd also need a $50K signing bonus to partially offset my unvested RSUs, and double-trigger acceleration for downside protection. My accept-at floor is $410K TC with a base of $265K and equity of $580K/4yr. Below that, I can't justify leaving liquid compensation at a public company."
