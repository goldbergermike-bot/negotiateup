**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at CoreWeave shape the cloud dashboard UX, GPU cluster management interfaces, and developer portal that AI researchers and enterprise customers interact with daily. In GPU cloud infrastructure, design isn't cosmetic — it's operational. A well-designed GPU cluster monitoring dashboard reduces customer support tickets, improves GPU utilization visibility, and accelerates customer onboarding. With CoreWeave's marquee customers including frontier AI labs and enterprises running mission-critical workloads, the design quality of the platform directly impacts customer retention and revenue. The IPO trajectory means that designers who negotiate pre-IPO equity today are positioned for significant upside as CoreWeave's platform becomes the standard for GPU cloud.

**HPC Premium — $295K Average TC, $420K+ Top 10%**
CoreWeave's average total compensation is $295K — but the top 10% earn $420K+. Push for "Tier 1" equity grants that put you in the top decile. CoreWeave pays an HPC (High-Performance Computing) premium because GPU cloud infrastructure requires rare expertise that most cloud engineers don't have: GPU cluster networking (NVLink, NVSwitch), InfiniBand fabrics, large-scale distributed computing, and the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of GPUs. When negotiating, frame it as: "CoreWeave's $295K average TC is the floor, not my target. I bring [specific HPC/GPU expertise] that puts me in the top 10% — the $420K+ tier. My equity grant should be Tier 1, reflecting that my expertise directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue." With IPO on the horizon, Tier 1 equity grants carry massive near-term upside. As a Product Designer, your HPC premium comes from a rare combination: understanding deeply technical GPU cloud infrastructure well enough to design intuitive interfaces for it. Designers who can visualize GPU cluster topologies, NVLink interconnects, and multi-tenant resource allocation in ways that make complex systems accessible are extremely scarce. Use this scarcity to push your equity grant toward the $232K upper end of the range.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity — Developer Experience Impact:** "Design directly drives customer adoption and retention in GPU cloud. A well-designed developer portal and cluster management dashboard reduces onboarding time from days to hours, which directly impacts revenue velocity. My equity grant should reflect this — I'm targeting $220K+/4yr because my design work is a customer acquisition and retention lever, not overhead."
2. **Infrastructure UX Design Scarcity:** "Product Designers who can design for GPU cloud infrastructure are extraordinarily rare. Most designers work on consumer apps or SaaS products — I've designed for [cloud dashboards/developer tools/infrastructure monitoring] at [previous company], and I understand how to make complex distributed systems visible and manageable for technical users. This infrastructure UX expertise commands a premium."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a design offer from [Google Cloud/Figma/Vercel] at $280K TC with liquid public equity. CoreWeave's pre-IPO equity is illiquid today, so I need a higher grant value to make the risk-adjusted math work. I'm targeting $250K+ TC to compensate for the liquidity discount."
4. **Portfolio Impact Quantification:** "At [previous company], my redesign of [specific dashboard/developer portal] led to a [X]% improvement in customer onboarding completion, [X]% reduction in support tickets, and [X]% increase in daily active users. At CoreWeave, I'll apply the same data-driven design approach to the GPU cloud platform — the impact on customer experience translates directly to revenue retention."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "CoreWeave's GPU cloud platform is solving one of the hardest design challenges in infrastructure — making GPU cluster management intuitive for AI researchers and enterprise teams. I'm excited about this challenge because I've spent [X] years designing for [cloud infrastructure/developer tools] at [previous company], where my work drove measurable improvements in customer adoption. I have a competing offer from [Google Cloud/Figma] at $275K TC with liquid equity. To make the move to CoreWeave pre-IPO, I need $250K TC — a base of $195K with an equity grant of $225K/4yr. My design portfolio demonstrates that I can translate complex GPU infrastructure concepts into intuitive interfaces that drive customer onboarding and retention. My accept-at floor is $230K TC with a base of $180K and equity of $200K/4yr. Below that, the risk-adjusted comparison to a liquid public company offer doesn't work."
