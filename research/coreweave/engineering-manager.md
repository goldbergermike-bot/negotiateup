**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at CoreWeave lead teams building the GPU cloud platform that powers AI training for frontier labs and enterprise customers. You're managing engineers who work on GPU cluster orchestration, bare-metal Kubernetes, NVLink/InfiniBand networking, and the billing and capacity systems that turn GPU hardware into cloud revenue. CoreWeave is scaling rapidly — with NVIDIA and Microsoft contracts driving demand — and EMs here own both technical delivery and team growth during the most critical phase of the company's trajectory toward IPO. The $301K-$414K TC range reflects the dual mandate of technical leadership and people management in a hypergrowth, pre-IPO environment.

**Level Mapping:** CoreWeave EM = Google L5 EM = AWS EM = Meta E5 Manager = Apple ICT4 Manager = Microsoft 64 Manager

**HPC Premium — $295K Average TC, $420K+ Top 10%**
CoreWeave's average total compensation is $295K — but the top 10% earn $420K+. Push for "Tier 1" equity grants that put you in the top decile. CoreWeave pays an HPC (High-Performance Computing) premium because GPU cloud infrastructure requires rare expertise that most cloud engineers don't have: GPU cluster networking (NVLink, NVSwitch), InfiniBand fabrics, large-scale distributed computing, and the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of GPUs. When negotiating, frame it as: "CoreWeave's $295K average TC is the floor, not my target. I bring [specific HPC/GPU expertise] that puts me in the top 10% — the $420K+ tier. My equity grant should be Tier 1, reflecting that my expertise directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue." With IPO on the horizon, Tier 1 equity grants carry massive near-term upside. As an Engineering Manager, your leverage is unique: you control the velocity and quality of entire engineering teams. Frame your value as the multiplier — if your team of 8-12 engineers each generates $300K+ in value, your management leverage is worth millions. EMs who have scaled GPU infrastructure teams or HPC-adjacent organizations should push firmly into the $420K+ top decile.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity — Team Multiplier Effect:** "As an EM, I'm a force multiplier — I don't just produce my own output, I multiply the output of an entire team. If I'm managing 10 engineers each delivering $300K+ in value, my management leverage justifies a Tier 1 equity grant of $500K+/4yr. I want to be aligned with CoreWeave's IPO trajectory, and top-decile equity is how I get there."
2. **GPU Infrastructure Team Leadership Scarcity:** "Engineering Managers who can lead GPU cloud infrastructure teams are extraordinarily rare. You need someone who understands NVLink topologies, InfiniBand fabrics, and bare-metal Kubernetes well enough to make sound architectural trade-offs with their team — while also scaling the org from [X] to [Y] engineers during hypergrowth. I've done this at [previous company] where I grew my team from [X] to [Y] and delivered [specific GPU/infra outcome]. This scarcity justifies an HPC premium in my compensation."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have an EM offer from [Google/AWS/NVIDIA] at $430K TC with liquid equity and a proven refresh cycle. CoreWeave's pre-IPO equity is illiquid, which means I need a materially higher grant to reach risk-adjusted parity. I'm targeting $400K+ TC with a $520K/4yr equity grant."
4. **Signing Bonus & Retention Protection:** "I'm forfeiting $[X]K in unvested equity at my current company to make this move. I need a signing bonus of $40K-$60K to bridge that gap, plus a guaranteed Year 2 refresh discussion. I'd also like double-trigger acceleration — if CoreWeave is acquired or I'm terminated without cause post-IPO, my unvested shares should accelerate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "CoreWeave is building the defining GPU cloud platform, and the EM role here is exactly the leadership challenge I'm looking for — scaling an engineering team during the pre-IPO hypergrowth phase while delivering GPU infrastructure that powers AI training at scale. I'm currently an EM at [Google/AWS/NVIDIA] with $415K TC in liquid equity, and I'd be forfeiting $180K in unvested RSUs. To justify this move, I need a package that reflects both the forfeited compensation and the illiquidity risk. I'm targeting $400K TC — a base of $265K with a Tier 1 equity grant of $520K/4yr — plus a $50K signing bonus to partially offset my unvested equity. My accept-at floor is $365K TC with a base of $245K and equity of $480K/4yr. I'd also need a guaranteed Year 2 refresh and double-trigger acceleration. Below $365K, the risk math doesn't work versus staying at a public company with liquid equity."
