**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at CoreWeave drive the most complex cross-functional programs in GPU cloud infrastructure — from data center buildout programs that bring thousands of NVIDIA GPUs online to GPU cluster deployment timelines that determine when new capacity becomes available for frontier AI lab customers. You're coordinating hardware procurement (NVIDIA GPU allocations), network fabric installation (InfiniBand), facility readiness, software platform integration, and customer onboarding — all on aggressive timelines driven by AI demand that outpaces supply. With CoreWeave's IPO on the horizon, program delivery velocity directly impacts revenue growth and the company's ability to fulfill its NVIDIA and Microsoft partnership commitments. The $219K-$294K TC range reflects the operational complexity and cross-functional coordination required at a hypergrowth GPU cloud company.

**Level Mapping:** CoreWeave TPM = Google L4 TPM = AWS TPM III = Meta E4 TPM = Apple TPM ICT3 = Microsoft 63 TPM

**HPC Premium — $295K Average TC, $420K+ Top 10%**
CoreWeave's average total compensation is $295K — but the top 10% earn $420K+. Push for "Tier 1" equity grants that put you in the top decile. CoreWeave pays an HPC (High-Performance Computing) premium because GPU cloud infrastructure requires rare expertise that most cloud engineers don't have: GPU cluster networking (NVLink, NVSwitch), InfiniBand fabrics, large-scale distributed computing, and the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of GPUs. When negotiating, frame it as: "CoreWeave's $295K average TC is the floor, not my target. I bring [specific HPC/GPU expertise] that puts me in the top 10% — the $420K+ tier. My equity grant should be Tier 1, reflecting that my expertise directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue." With IPO on the horizon, Tier 1 equity grants carry massive near-term upside. As a TPM, your HPC premium comes from program management expertise specific to GPU infrastructure — understanding data center buildout dependencies (power, cooling, networking), GPU cluster deployment sequences, InfiniBand fabric commissioning timelines, and the hardware supply chain constraints that determine when capacity comes online. TPMs who can shave weeks off a GPU cluster deployment timeline are directly accelerating CoreWeave's revenue recognition.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity — Program Velocity = Revenue:** "Every week I accelerate a GPU cluster deployment, CoreWeave begins earning revenue from those GPUs sooner. At current GPU-hour pricing, bringing a 1,000-GPU cluster online one week early translates to hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional revenue. My program management directly drives revenue velocity, and my equity grant should reflect this at $275K+/4yr."
2. **Data Center & GPU Deployment Program Expertise:** "TPMs who understand the full stack of GPU data center programs — from power and cooling infrastructure to InfiniBand fabric commissioning to GPU cluster software bring-up — are rare. I've managed [X]-scale data center or HPC facility buildouts at [previous company], bringing [Y] GPUs online on [Z] timeline. This expertise directly maps to CoreWeave's expansion program and justifies an HPC premium."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a TPM offer from [Google/AWS/Meta] at $310K TC with liquid public equity and a proven refresh cycle. CoreWeave's pre-IPO equity carries a liquidity discount, and the program complexity — coordinating NVIDIA GPU allocations, data center buildouts, and customer onboarding — is more intense than standard cloud TPM work. I'm targeting $285K+ TC with a $280K/4yr equity grant."
4. **Customer Onboarding Program Impact:** "Beyond data center buildouts, I'd be managing customer onboarding programs for CoreWeave's largest enterprise and AI lab customers. Faster onboarding means faster revenue recognition and higher customer satisfaction. I'd like to discuss tying a portion of my Year 2 refresh to customer onboarding velocity metrics — time to first GPU allocation, customer ramp-up speed, and deployment success rate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "CoreWeave's GPU cloud expansion is the most complex infrastructure program in the industry right now — data center buildouts at unprecedented scale, NVIDIA GPU procurement coordination, InfiniBand fabric deployment, and customer onboarding for frontier AI labs. This is exactly the program management challenge I thrive on. I have a competing TPM offer from [Google/AWS] at $305K TC with liquid equity. To move to CoreWeave, I need the package to reflect the illiquidity risk and the intensity of GPU infrastructure programs. I'm targeting $285K TC — a base of $215K with a Tier 1 equity grant of $280K/4yr. I've managed [X]-scale data center buildout programs at [previous company], bringing GPU clusters online [Y] weeks ahead of schedule. My accept-at floor is $260K TC with a base of $200K and equity of $240K/4yr. I'd also want a guaranteed Year 2 refresh tied to program delivery metrics. Below $260K, the risk-adjusted comparison to a public company with liquid equity doesn't work."
