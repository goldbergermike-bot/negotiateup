### Solutions Architect | CoreWeave Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + High Base | GPU Cloud Infrastructure | HPC Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / Roseland NJ | $185K-$232K | $180K-$318K | Variable | $230K-$312K |
| Remote US | $178K-$224K | $180K-$318K | Variable | $223K-$304K |
| London | £139K-£175K | £136K-£240K | Variable | £173K-£235K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at CoreWeave are the technical face of the company to its most important customers — designing enterprise GPU cloud deployments for frontier AI labs, guiding large-scale distributed training architectures, and ensuring that customers extract maximum performance from CoreWeave's NVIDIA GPU clusters. You're working directly with AI research teams at companies building foundation models, helping them architect multi-thousand-GPU training runs with optimal NVLink and InfiniBand topology configurations. With NVIDIA and Microsoft as anchor partners, and a pipeline of enterprise AI customers driving CoreWeave toward IPO, Solutions Architects are directly responsible for landing and expanding the contracts that define CoreWeave's revenue trajectory. The $230K-$312K TC range excludes variable compensation, which can add meaningful upside for customer-facing roles.

**Level Mapping:** CoreWeave Solutions Architect = Google Cloud Customer Engineer L4 = AWS Solutions Architect III = Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect = NVIDIA Solutions Architect

**HPC Premium — $295K Average TC, $420K+ Top 10%**
CoreWeave's average total compensation is $295K — but the top 10% earn $420K+. Push for "Tier 1" equity grants that put you in the top decile. CoreWeave pays an HPC (High-Performance Computing) premium because GPU cloud infrastructure requires rare expertise that most cloud engineers don't have: GPU cluster networking (NVLink, NVSwitch), InfiniBand fabrics, large-scale distributed computing, and the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of GPUs. When negotiating, frame it as: "CoreWeave's $295K average TC is the floor, not my target. I bring [specific HPC/GPU expertise] that puts me in the top 10% — the $420K+ tier. My equity grant should be Tier 1, reflecting that my expertise directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue." With IPO on the horizon, Tier 1 equity grants carry massive near-term upside. As a Solutions Architect, your HPC premium comes from the rare ability to design enterprise GPU cloud architectures that work at scale — understanding NVLink topologies for multi-node training, InfiniBand fabric design for low-latency GPU-to-GPU communication, and the distributed computing patterns that frontier AI labs need for training runs across thousands of GPUs. SAs who can close enterprise deals by demonstrating deep GPU infrastructure expertise directly drive CoreWeave's revenue growth.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity — Deal Influence Quantification:** "As a Solutions Architect, I directly influence enterprise deal size and customer retention. At [previous company], I supported $[X]M in customer deployments through architectural guidance and proof-of-concept builds. At CoreWeave, the deals are even larger — frontier AI labs are spending $10M+ annually on GPU cloud. My equity grant should reflect my direct revenue influence at $310K+/4yr."
2. **GPU Architecture Design Expertise:** "Solutions Architects who can design multi-thousand-GPU training architectures — optimizing NVLink topologies, InfiniBand fabric layouts, and distributed training frameworks for customer workloads — are extraordinarily rare. I've designed [specific GPU cluster architecture] at [previous company/customer] for [specific workload], and I understand the trade-offs between DGX-style deployments and custom cluster configurations. This expertise directly accelerates CoreWeave's enterprise sales cycle."
3. **Variable Compensation + Equity Stack:** "I'd like to discuss adding a variable compensation component tied to customer deployment milestones — either a percentage of deal value or a per-deployment bonus. Stacked on top of my base and equity, this would bring my total on-target earnings to $340K+, which reflects the revenue impact of the SA role. At [previous company], my variable comp was $[X]K based on customer success metrics."
4. **Competing Offer — Customer-Facing Premium:** "I have an SA offer from [AWS/Google Cloud/NVIDIA] at $330K OTE with liquid equity and a proven variable comp structure. CoreWeave's pre-IPO equity requires a premium, and the customer-facing intensity of this role — working with frontier AI labs on mission-critical training runs — justifies additional compensation. I'm targeting $305K+ TC before variable, with a $310K/4yr equity grant."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "CoreWeave's enterprise GPU cloud business is the most exciting solutions architecture opportunity in the market — the customers are frontier AI labs building foundation models, the technical challenges involve multi-thousand-GPU architectures, and the business is on an IPO trajectory. I have a competing SA offer from [AWS/Google Cloud] at $325K OTE with liquid equity. To move to CoreWeave, I need the package to reflect the illiquidity risk, the intensity of enterprise GPU cloud work, and my expertise in designing large-scale GPU training architectures. I'm targeting $305K TC — a base of $225K, a Tier 1 equity grant of $315K/4yr, plus a variable component tied to customer deployment success. I've designed GPU cluster architectures for [X] enterprise customers at [previous company], supporting $[X]M in deployments. My accept-at floor is $280K TC with a base of $205K and equity of $300K/4yr, plus variable. Below $280K, I can't justify the risk premium over a liquid public company offer with proven variable comp."
