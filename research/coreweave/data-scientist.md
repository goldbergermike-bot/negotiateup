### Data Scientist | CoreWeave Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + High Base | GPU Cloud Infrastructure | HPC Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / Roseland NJ | $182K-$228K | $180K-$318K | — | $227K-$308K |
| Remote US | $175K-$220K | $180K-$318K | — | $220K-$300K |
| London | £137K-£172K | £136K-£240K | — | £171K-£232K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at CoreWeave operate at the intersection of GPU cloud economics and machine learning — building the analytics that drive GPU utilization optimization, capacity forecasting, and dynamic pricing across CoreWeave's massive fleet of NVIDIA GPUs. This is not typical product analytics work: you're modeling GPU cluster performance, predicting capacity demand from frontier AI labs, and optimizing pricing algorithms that determine CoreWeave's revenue per GPU-hour. With NVIDIA and Microsoft as anchor customers and IPO on the horizon, the data models you build directly shape the financial metrics that Wall Street will scrutinize. The $227K-$308K TC range reflects the strategic importance of this role in a company where GPU utilization efficiency is the primary driver of margins.

**Level Mapping:** CoreWeave Data Scientist = Google L4 Data Scientist = AWS Data Scientist II = Meta E4 Data Scientist = Apple DS ICT3

**HPC Premium — $295K Average TC, $420K+ Top 10%**
CoreWeave's average total compensation is $295K — but the top 10% earn $420K+. Push for "Tier 1" equity grants that put you in the top decile. CoreWeave pays an HPC (High-Performance Computing) premium because GPU cloud infrastructure requires rare expertise that most cloud engineers don't have: GPU cluster networking (NVLink, NVSwitch), InfiniBand fabrics, large-scale distributed computing, and the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of GPUs. When negotiating, frame it as: "CoreWeave's $295K average TC is the floor, not my target. I bring [specific HPC/GPU expertise] that puts me in the top 10% — the $420K+ tier. My equity grant should be Tier 1, reflecting that my expertise directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue." With IPO on the horizon, Tier 1 equity grants carry massive near-term upside. As a Data Scientist, your HPC premium comes from the ability to model GPU cluster performance and capacity economics — skills that combine traditional data science with deep understanding of GPU workload characteristics (training vs. inference memory patterns, multi-node scaling efficiency, NVLink bandwidth utilization). Data Scientists who can build capacity forecasting models that account for GPU architecture-specific constraints are rare and directly impact CoreWeave's margin optimization ahead of IPO.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity — Revenue Optimization Impact:** "My capacity forecasting and pricing models directly impact CoreWeave's revenue per GPU-hour — the single most important metric for IPO valuation. If I can improve GPU utilization by even 2-3%, that translates to tens of millions in additional annual revenue. My equity grant should reflect this revenue impact — I'm targeting $300K+/4yr as a Tier 1 grant that aligns my incentives with CoreWeave's margin optimization."
2. **GPU Analytics Domain Expertise:** "Data Scientists who understand GPU cluster performance modeling are rare. I've built [capacity forecasting models/pricing optimization systems/utilization analytics] at [previous company] that account for GPU-specific workload characteristics — training job scheduling, inference latency SLAs, memory bandwidth constraints. This isn't standard analytics work; it's GPU infrastructure economics, and it commands an HPC premium."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a DS offer from [Google/Meta/NVIDIA] at $330K TC with liquid public equity. CoreWeave's pre-IPO equity carries a liquidity discount, so I need a higher grant value to reach risk-adjusted parity. I'm targeting $295K+ TC with a $310K/4yr equity grant."
4. **IPO Readiness — Investor Metrics:** "As CoreWeave approaches IPO, the data models I build will directly inform the investor narrative — GPU utilization rates, capacity growth forecasts, revenue per GPU-hour trends. Data Scientists who can build investor-grade analytics that withstand Wall Street scrutiny are worth a premium. I'd like to discuss tying my Year 2 refresh to the quality and impact of the analytics infrastructure I build for the IPO process."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "CoreWeave is the most interesting data science opportunity in infrastructure right now — the GPU utilization optimization, capacity forecasting, and dynamic pricing challenges are technically fascinating and directly tied to revenue. I have a competing DS offer from [NVIDIA/Google] at $320K TC with liquid equity. To make the move to CoreWeave pre-IPO, I need a package that reflects the illiquidity risk and my GPU analytics expertise. I'm targeting $300K TC — a base of $220K with a Tier 1 equity grant of $315K/4yr. I've built GPU capacity models at [previous company] that improved utilization by [X]%, and I can bring that expertise to CoreWeave's fleet optimization from day one. My accept-at floor is $275K TC with a base of $205K and equity of $280K/4yr. I'd also want a guaranteed Year 2 refresh tied to performance. Below $275K, the risk-adjusted math doesn't support leaving liquid compensation."
