### Software Engineer | CoreWeave Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + High Base | GPU Cloud Infrastructure | HPC Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / Roseland NJ | $170K-$212K | $155K-$272K | — | $209K-$280K |
| Remote US | $162K-$205K | $155K-$272K | — | $201K-$273K |
| London | £128K-£160K | £117K-£205K | — | £157K-£211K |

**Negotiation DNA**
CoreWeave is the dominant AI-focused GPU cloud provider, purpose-built for training, fine-tuning, and inference workloads at scale — and Software Engineers here build the cloud platform that powers frontier AI labs including partnerships with NVIDIA and Microsoft. With a $35B+ valuation and IPO on the near-term horizon, pre-IPO equity grants carry significant upside that candidates must negotiate aggressively. Even at the SWE level, you are building infrastructure that directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue — from cluster orchestration APIs to billing systems to the developer experience layer that onboards enterprise AI customers.

**Level Mapping:** CoreWeave SWE = Google L3-L4 = AWS SWE = Meta E3-E4 = Apple ICT2-ICT3

**HPC Premium — $295K Average TC, $420K+ Top 10%**
CoreWeave's average total compensation is $295K — but the top 10% earn $420K+. Push for "Tier 1" equity grants that put you in the top decile. CoreWeave pays an HPC (High-Performance Computing) premium because GPU cloud infrastructure requires rare expertise that most cloud engineers don't have: GPU cluster networking (NVLink, NVSwitch), InfiniBand fabrics, large-scale distributed computing, and the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of GPUs. When negotiating, frame it as: "CoreWeave's $295K average TC is the floor, not my target. I bring [specific HPC/GPU expertise] that puts me in the top 10% — the $420K+ tier. My equity grant should be Tier 1, reflecting that my expertise directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue." With IPO on the horizon, Tier 1 equity grants carry massive near-term upside. As a Software Engineer, emphasize any experience with GPU-aware systems, distributed computing, Kubernetes internals, or infrastructure that scales to thousands of nodes — these skills are rare at the SWE level and justify pushing toward the upper band of the $209K-$280K TC range.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "I understand CoreWeave is on an IPO trajectory with a $35B+ valuation. I'd like to weight my compensation toward equity — specifically a Tier 1 grant. Given the near-term liquidity event, I'm willing to accept a base at $195K if the equity grant is at $272K/4yr or above. This aligns my incentives with CoreWeave's growth."
2. **GPU Cloud Platform Scarcity:** "Building cloud platform software for GPU clusters isn't standard SWE work — it requires understanding GPU scheduling, CUDA workload characteristics, and bare-metal Kubernetes. My experience with [specific distributed systems/GPU-adjacent work] means I can contribute to CoreWeave's core platform from day one, which justifies positioning me at the top of the SWE band."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have an offer from [AWS/GCP/Azure] at $[X] TC with immediate public equity liquidity. CoreWeave's pre-IPO equity is illiquid today, which means I need a higher grant value to compensate for the liquidity discount. I'm targeting $250K+ TC to make the risk-adjusted math work."
4. **Accelerated Vesting / Refresh:** "Given the IPO timeline, I'd like to discuss accelerated vesting — either a 1-year cliff with monthly vesting thereafter, or a front-loaded schedule (40/30/20/10) so I capture more upside if IPO happens in the first two years. I'd also like a guaranteed Year 2 refresh discussion tied to performance."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about CoreWeave's position as the GPU cloud leader — the NVIDIA and Microsoft partnerships, the IPO trajectory, and the technical depth of the platform are exactly what I'm looking for. I have a competing offer at $245K TC from [AWS/GCP] with liquid public equity. To make the move to CoreWeave, I need the compensation to reflect both the illiquidity risk and my ability to contribute to GPU cloud platform engineering immediately. I'm targeting $265K TC — a base of $200K with a Tier 1 equity grant of $260K/4yr. That puts me closer to the $295K company average as I grow into Senior. My accept-at floor is $240K TC with a base of $185K and equity of $220K/4yr. Below that, the risk-adjusted math doesn't work versus a liquid public company offer."
