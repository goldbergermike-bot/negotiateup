### DevOps Engineer | CoreWeave Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + High Base | GPU Cloud Infrastructure | HPC Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / Roseland NJ | $185K-$232K | $195K-$342K | — | $234K-$318K |
| Remote US | $178K-$224K | $195K-$342K | — | $227K-$310K |
| London | £139K-£175K | £147K-£258K | — | £176K-£240K |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at CoreWeave are the operational backbone of the GPU cloud platform — managing Kubernetes on bare metal across thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, building the infrastructure automation that provisions and scales GPU clusters, and ensuring the reliability of a platform that frontier AI labs depend on for model training. This is not standard cloud DevOps: you're operating bare-metal GPU servers with NVLink interconnects, managing InfiniBand networking fabrics, and automating the deployment of GPU clusters across CoreWeave's rapidly expanding data center footprint. With NVIDIA and Microsoft as anchor customers, downtime on CoreWeave's platform means lost revenue for the most demanding AI workloads in the world. The $234K-$318K TC range reflects the operational criticality and HPC-specific expertise this role demands.

**Level Mapping:** CoreWeave DevOps = Google L4 SRE = AWS DevOps Engineer II = Meta E4 Production Engineer = Apple SRE ICT3

**HPC Premium — $295K Average TC, $420K+ Top 10%**
CoreWeave's average total compensation is $295K — but the top 10% earn $420K+. Push for "Tier 1" equity grants that put you in the top decile. CoreWeave pays an HPC (High-Performance Computing) premium because GPU cloud infrastructure requires rare expertise that most cloud engineers don't have: GPU cluster networking (NVLink, NVSwitch), InfiniBand fabrics, large-scale distributed computing, and the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of GPUs. When negotiating, frame it as: "CoreWeave's $295K average TC is the floor, not my target. I bring [specific HPC/GPU expertise] that puts me in the top 10% — the $420K+ tier. My equity grant should be Tier 1, reflecting that my expertise directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue." With IPO on the horizon, Tier 1 equity grants carry massive near-term upside. As a DevOps Engineer, your HPC premium comes from operational expertise with GPU clusters — experience running Kubernetes on bare metal with GPU-aware scheduling, managing InfiniBand fabrics, automating GPU cluster provisioning, and troubleshooting GPU-specific failure modes (NVLink errors, GPU memory corruption, thermal throttling). DevOps engineers who can keep thousands of GPUs running at high utilization are directly responsible for CoreWeave's revenue delivery.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity — Uptime = Revenue:** "GPU cloud uptime directly translates to revenue. Every hour of downtime on a cluster of 1,000 H100s represents hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost customer revenue. My operational expertise keeps CoreWeave's GPU fleet running — that's not overhead, it's revenue protection. My equity grant should reflect this at $320K+/4yr, putting me on the path to Tier 1."
2. **Bare-Metal Kubernetes + GPU Expertise:** "Running Kubernetes on bare metal with GPU-aware scheduling is a niche skill set. Most DevOps engineers work with managed Kubernetes on cloud providers — I've operated [bare-metal K8s clusters/GPU clusters/InfiniBand fabrics] at [previous company] with [X] GPUs across [Y] nodes. This expertise is directly transferable to CoreWeave's platform and commands an HPC premium."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a DevOps/SRE offer from [Google/AWS/NVIDIA] at $320K TC with liquid public equity and on-call compensation. CoreWeave's pre-IPO equity is illiquid, and the on-call demands for GPU cloud infrastructure are intense. I need $305K+ TC with a $330K/4yr equity grant to make the risk-adjusted math work."
4. **Data Center Expansion Leverage:** "CoreWeave is rapidly expanding its data center footprint to meet AI demand. I've managed infrastructure automation for [X]-scale data center buildouts at [previous company], including GPU cluster provisioning, network fabric deployment, and capacity scaling. My experience directly accelerates CoreWeave's expansion timeline — which is critical for capturing AI lab contracts before competitors."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "CoreWeave's GPU cloud operations challenge is exactly what I'm looking for — bare-metal Kubernetes at scale, GPU cluster automation, InfiniBand networking — this is the cutting edge of infrastructure operations. I have a competing SRE offer from [Google/AWS] at $315K TC with liquid equity and on-call compensation. To move to CoreWeave pre-IPO, I need the package to reflect both the liquidity risk and the intensity of GPU cloud operations. I'm targeting $305K TC — a base of $225K with a Tier 1 equity grant of $325K/4yr. I've operated [X] GPU clusters with [Y] nodes at [previous company] and reduced unplanned downtime by [Z]%, which directly translates to revenue protection at CoreWeave. My accept-at floor is $280K TC with a base of $210K and equity of $280K/4yr. I'd also need on-call compensation or additional equity for the operational demands. Below $280K, I can't justify the move from a liquid public company."
