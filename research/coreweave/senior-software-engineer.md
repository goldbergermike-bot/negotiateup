### Senior Software Engineer | CoreWeave Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + High Base | GPU Cloud Infrastructure | HPC Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / Roseland NJ | $200K-$248K | $245K-$428K | — | $261K-$355K |
| Remote US | $192K-$240K | $245K-$428K | — | $253K-$347K |
| London | £150K-£187K | £185K-£322K | — | £196K-£268K |

**Negotiation DNA**
At the Senior level, CoreWeave engineers own critical subsystems of the GPU cloud platform — from the Kubernetes-based orchestration layer that schedules workloads across thousands of NVIDIA GPUs to the networking stack that connects GPU clusters via NVLink and InfiniBand. CoreWeave's major contracts with NVIDIA, Microsoft, and frontier AI labs mean that the software you build directly enables billions in revenue, and the company pays accordingly. With IPO expected in the near term, Senior Engineers who negotiate Tier 1 equity grants today are positioned for substantial wealth creation — the $261K-$355K TC range is the starting point, not the ceiling.

**Level Mapping:** CoreWeave Senior SWE = Google L4 = AWS Senior SWE = Meta E4 = Apple ICT3 = Microsoft 63

**HPC Premium — $295K Average TC, $420K+ Top 10%**
CoreWeave's average total compensation is $295K — but the top 10% earn $420K+. Push for "Tier 1" equity grants that put you in the top decile. CoreWeave pays an HPC (High-Performance Computing) premium because GPU cloud infrastructure requires rare expertise that most cloud engineers don't have: GPU cluster networking (NVLink, NVSwitch), InfiniBand fabrics, large-scale distributed computing, and the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of GPUs. When negotiating, frame it as: "CoreWeave's $295K average TC is the floor, not my target. I bring [specific HPC/GPU expertise] that puts me in the top 10% — the $420K+ tier. My equity grant should be Tier 1, reflecting that my expertise directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue." With IPO on the horizon, Tier 1 equity grants carry massive near-term upside. As a Senior Software Engineer, you are the backbone of CoreWeave's engineering organization — you own design decisions, mentor junior engineers, and drive the technical direction of subsystems. Emphasize ownership of GPU-aware systems, distributed computing at scale, or Kubernetes platform internals to push from the $261K midpoint toward the $355K+ upper band.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "I want to maximize my equity exposure given the IPO trajectory. At the Senior level, I'm looking for a Tier 1 equity grant of $400K+/4yr. I've seen Senior Engineers at pre-IPO companies of CoreWeave's scale receive grants in this range, and my experience with [GPU scheduling/distributed systems/Kubernetes at scale] justifies top-of-band positioning. I'll accept a base at $220K to make the equity math work."
2. **HPC Expertise Scarcity:** "Senior Engineers who understand GPU cluster architecture — NVLink topologies, InfiniBand networking, bare-metal Kubernetes — are extraordinarily rare. I've built [specific GPU/HPC system] that handled [scale metric], which maps directly to CoreWeave's cluster orchestration challenges. This expertise commands an HPC premium, and I expect my offer to reflect that."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I'm holding a Senior SWE offer from [Google/Meta/NVIDIA] at $380K TC with fully liquid public equity. CoreWeave's pre-IPO equity carries a liquidity discount — I need a higher grant value on paper to reach risk-adjusted parity. I'm targeting $340K+ TC with a $400K/4yr equity grant to offset the illiquidity."
4. **IPO-Linked Acceleration & Refresh:** "I'd like to negotiate IPO-linked acceleration — if CoreWeave goes public within 24 months, I want 50% of my unvested shares to accelerate on the IPO date. Additionally, I want a guaranteed Year 2 equity refresh discussion tied to performance, with a target of 75% of my initial grant value as the refresh baseline."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "CoreWeave is where I want to be — the GPU cloud infrastructure you're building is the most technically interesting work in cloud computing right now, and the NVIDIA/Microsoft partnerships validate the business. I'm holding a competing offer at $370K TC from [Google/NVIDIA] with liquid equity. To make the move to pre-IPO CoreWeave, I need the total compensation to reflect the liquidity risk and my HPC expertise. I'm targeting $340K TC — a base of $235K with a Tier 1 equity grant of $420K/4yr. That puts me above the $295K company average, which is appropriate for a Senior Engineer with my GPU infrastructure background. My accept-at floor is $310K TC with a base of $215K and equity of $380K/4yr. I'd also like to discuss accelerated vesting tied to the IPO and a guaranteed Year 2 refresh. Below $310K, I can't justify the risk premium over a liquid public company offer."
