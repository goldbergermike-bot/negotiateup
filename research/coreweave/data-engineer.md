### Data Engineer | CoreWeave Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + High Base | GPU Cloud Infrastructure | HPC Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC / Roseland NJ | $175K-$218K | $165K-$292K | — | $216K-$291K |
| Remote US | $168K-$211K | $165K-$292K | — | $209K-$284K |
| London | £132K-£164K | £124K-£220K | — | £163K-£219K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at CoreWeave build the infrastructure telemetry pipelines, GPU utilization data systems, and capacity analytics platforms that power CoreWeave's operational intelligence. Every GPU-hour across thousands of NVIDIA H100s and B200s generates telemetry data — temperature, utilization, memory bandwidth, NVLink throughput, error rates — and Data Engineers build the real-time pipelines that ingest, process, and serve this data to operations teams, capacity planners, and pricing algorithms. With CoreWeave's fleet expanding rapidly to meet AI demand, the data infrastructure that tracks GPU health and utilization is directly tied to revenue optimization and operational efficiency. The IPO trajectory makes this role strategically important: investor-grade data infrastructure is a prerequisite for the financial reporting and capacity metrics that Wall Street expects.

**Level Mapping:** CoreWeave Data Engineer = Google L4 Data Engineer = AWS Data Engineer II = Meta E4 Data Engineer = Apple DE ICT3

**HPC Premium — $295K Average TC, $420K+ Top 10%**
CoreWeave's average total compensation is $295K — but the top 10% earn $420K+. Push for "Tier 1" equity grants that put you in the top decile. CoreWeave pays an HPC (High-Performance Computing) premium because GPU cloud infrastructure requires rare expertise that most cloud engineers don't have: GPU cluster networking (NVLink, NVSwitch), InfiniBand fabrics, large-scale distributed computing, and the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of GPUs. When negotiating, frame it as: "CoreWeave's $295K average TC is the floor, not my target. I bring [specific HPC/GPU expertise] that puts me in the top 10% — the $420K+ tier. My equity grant should be Tier 1, reflecting that my expertise directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue." With IPO on the horizon, Tier 1 equity grants carry massive near-term upside. As a Data Engineer, your HPC premium comes from expertise in building telemetry pipelines for GPU infrastructure at scale — ingesting real-time GPU metrics (utilization, temperature, memory, NVLink throughput) from thousands of GPUs, building the data models that power capacity planning, and creating the analytics infrastructure that drives pricing optimization. Data Engineers who understand GPU-specific telemetry and HPC data patterns are rare and directly enable CoreWeave's operational efficiency.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity — Operational Intelligence Impact:** "The GPU telemetry pipelines I build are the foundation of CoreWeave's operational intelligence — GPU utilization tracking, capacity forecasting, and pricing optimization all depend on the data infrastructure I create. If my pipelines improve GPU utilization visibility by even a few percentage points, that translates to millions in additional revenue. My equity grant should reflect this at $280K+/4yr."
2. **GPU Telemetry Pipeline Expertise:** "Building data pipelines for GPU infrastructure telemetry is fundamentally different from standard data engineering. I need to handle real-time metrics from thousands of GPUs — NVIDIA DCGM metrics, NVLink throughput, InfiniBand counters, GPU memory utilization patterns — at massive scale with sub-second latency. I've built [specific infrastructure telemetry system] at [previous company] that processed [X] events/sec from [Y] nodes. This GPU-specific data engineering expertise commands an HPC premium."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a Data Engineering offer from [Google/Databricks/Snowflake] at $310K TC with liquid public equity. CoreWeave's pre-IPO equity is illiquid, and the data engineering challenge here — real-time GPU telemetry at HPC scale — is more complex than standard data platform work. I'm targeting $280K+ TC with a $285K/4yr equity grant."
4. **IPO Data Infrastructure Readiness:** "As CoreWeave approaches IPO, investor-grade data infrastructure becomes critical — accurate GPU utilization reporting, capacity growth metrics, revenue per GPU-hour tracking, and financial data pipelines that pass SOX audit requirements. I've built [SOX-compliant/investor-grade] data infrastructure at [previous company], and that expertise directly accelerates CoreWeave's IPO readiness. This should be reflected in my equity grant."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "CoreWeave's data engineering challenge is unique — building real-time telemetry pipelines for thousands of GPUs, powering capacity analytics and pricing optimization, and creating the data infrastructure that will support IPO-grade financial reporting. I have a competing offer from [Databricks/Snowflake/Google] at $305K TC with liquid equity. To move to CoreWeave pre-IPO, I need the package to reflect the liquidity risk and my infrastructure telemetry expertise. I'm targeting $280K TC — a base of $212K with a Tier 1 equity grant of $285K/4yr. I've built GPU/infrastructure telemetry pipelines at [previous company] processing [X] events/sec from [Y] nodes, and I can bring that expertise to CoreWeave's fleet monitoring from day one. My accept-at floor is $255K TC with a base of $195K and equity of $240K/4yr. I'd also want a guaranteed Year 2 refresh tied to data platform delivery milestones. Below $255K, the risk-adjusted math doesn't support leaving liquid compensation."
