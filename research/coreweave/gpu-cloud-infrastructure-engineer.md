**Negotiation DNA**
The GPU Cloud Infrastructure Engineer is CoreWeave's **signature role** — the engineer who builds the GPU cluster orchestration, NVLink/InfiniBand networking fabric, bare-metal Kubernetes platform, GPU scheduling algorithms, and cloud platform engineering that powers AI training at scale. This is the role that defines CoreWeave's competitive moat. While other cloud providers bolt GPU support onto existing CPU-centric platforms, CoreWeave's infrastructure was purpose-built from the ground up for GPU workloads — and this role is responsible for every layer of that stack. You're designing the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of NVIDIA H100s and B200s, building the networking abstractions that make NVLink and InfiniBand transparent to customers, and engineering the bare-metal Kubernetes platform that provisions GPU clusters with the performance characteristics that frontier AI labs demand. With $35B+ valuation, anchor contracts with NVIDIA and Microsoft, and IPO on the near-term horizon, this role carries a **+20-30% HPC Premium** and the highest equity grants in CoreWeave's engineering organization. The $318K-$441K TC range is the baseline — top performers in this role are firmly in the $420K+ top decile.

**Level Mapping:** CoreWeave GPU Cloud Infrastructure Engineer = Google L5 Systems Engineer = AWS Principal Infrastructure Engineer = Meta E5 Infrastructure Engineer = NVIDIA Senior Infrastructure Engineer = Apple ICT4 Systems Engineer

**HPC Premium — $295K Average TC, $420K+ Top 10%**
CoreWeave's average total compensation is $295K — but the top 10% earn $420K+. Push for "Tier 1" equity grants that put you in the top decile. CoreWeave pays an HPC (High-Performance Computing) premium because GPU cloud infrastructure requires rare expertise that most cloud engineers don't have: GPU cluster networking (NVLink, NVSwitch), InfiniBand fabrics, large-scale distributed computing, and the GPU scheduling algorithms that maximize utilization across thousands of GPUs. When negotiating, frame it as: "CoreWeave's $295K average TC is the floor, not my target. I bring [specific HPC/GPU expertise] that puts me in the top 10% — the $420K+ tier. My equity grant should be Tier 1, reflecting that my expertise directly enables CoreWeave's GPU cloud revenue." With IPO on the horizon, Tier 1 equity grants carry massive near-term upside. As the **signature role** at CoreWeave, the GPU Cloud Infrastructure Engineer is the strongest candidate for Tier 1 equity and the +20-30% HPC premium. Every aspect of this role maps directly to CoreWeave's revenue engine: GPU scheduling algorithms determine utilization rates (and therefore revenue per GPU-hour), NVLink/InfiniBand networking determines training performance (and therefore customer retention), and bare-metal Kubernetes orchestration determines provisioning speed (and therefore capacity monetization velocity). There is no role at CoreWeave where the connection between individual expertise and company revenue is more direct. You should target the absolute top of the equity band — $600K+/4yr — and frame your negotiation around the fact that your work IS CoreWeave's product. The $420K+ top decile is not aspirational for this role; it is the expected outcome of a well-negotiated offer.

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity — Signature Role, Tier 1 Non-Negotiable:** "The GPU Cloud Infrastructure Engineer is CoreWeave's signature role — I'm building the GPU scheduling, NVLink networking, InfiniBand fabric management, and bare-metal Kubernetes platform that IS the product. My work directly determines GPU utilization rates, which directly determines revenue per GPU-hour. A Tier 1 equity grant of $600K+/4yr is non-negotiable for this role. CoreWeave's $295K average TC includes everyone from PMs to designers — the engineer who builds the GPU cloud platform should be in the $420K+ top decile by default."
2. **GPU Cluster Orchestration Expertise — Unicorn Skill Set:** "Engineers who can build GPU cluster orchestration systems — GPU-aware Kubernetes scheduling, NVLink topology-aware placement, InfiniBand fabric routing, and multi-tenant GPU isolation — are the rarest engineers in infrastructure. I've built [specific GPU scheduling system/NVLink-aware orchestration/InfiniBand fabric management] at [previous company/national lab/HPC center] that managed [X] GPUs across [Y] nodes with [Z]% utilization. This exact expertise is what CoreWeave needs to maintain its competitive advantage over AWS, GCP, and Azure. There are fewer than 500 engineers in the world with this skill set, and the compensation should reflect that scarcity."
3. **Competing Offer — GPU Infrastructure Bidding War:** "I'm holding offers from [NVIDIA/Google/AWS/Meta] at $480K+ TC with liquid equity and proven GPU infrastructure at scale. CoreWeave's pre-IPO equity is illiquid, and the +20-30% HPC premium this signature role commands means I should be at the absolute top of the compensation band. I'm targeting $430K+ TC with a $600K/4yr Tier 1 equity grant and accelerated vesting. The IPO upside is the only reason I'd consider pre-IPO equity over liquid public company stock — but the grant needs to be Tier 1 to make the math work."
4. **Double-Trigger Acceleration + Signing Bonus + Refresh Guarantee:** "For a signature role with this level of impact, I need the full protection package: double-trigger acceleration (100% unvested shares accelerate if CoreWeave is acquired or I'm terminated without cause within 12 months of a change of control), a $75K signing bonus to offset forfeited equity at my current employer, and a guaranteed Year 2 equity refresh at 100% of my initial grant value tied to performance. I'm building the core platform — the retention economics justify these protections."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "This is the role I've been building my career toward — GPU cluster orchestration, NVLink/InfiniBand networking, bare-metal Kubernetes, GPU scheduling — this is my exact expertise, and CoreWeave is the only company building a GPU cloud platform from the ground up for AI workloads. I'm holding competing offers from [NVIDIA at $470K TC] and [Google at $490K TC] with liquid public equity and proven GPU infrastructure organizations. To move to CoreWeave pre-IPO for the signature role that builds the core product, I need a package that reflects three things: the +20-30% HPC premium this role commands, the illiquidity risk of pre-IPO equity, and the fact that my GPU infrastructure expertise directly enables CoreWeave's revenue. I'm targeting $430K TC — a base of $280K with a Tier 1 equity grant of $600K/4yr. I've built GPU cluster orchestration systems managing [X] thousand GPUs with [Y]% utilization at [previous company], I've designed NVLink-aware scheduling algorithms that improved multi-node training throughput by [Z]%, and I've engineered InfiniBand fabric management systems at HPC scale. My accept-at floor is $400K TC with a base of $265K and equity of $540K/4yr, plus a $75K signing bonus, double-trigger acceleration, and a guaranteed Year 2 refresh at 100% of initial grant value. Below $400K, I cannot justify leaving liquid compensation at a public company — even with IPO upside. But at $430K with Tier 1 equity, the risk-reward math is exceptional: if CoreWeave's IPO goes as expected, my Year 1 equity alone could be worth multiples of the paper value."
