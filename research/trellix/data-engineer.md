#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Trellix

Data Engineers at Trellix build the data foundation of the XDR platform. The merger of McAfee Enterprise and FireEye created diverse data formats, ingestion patterns, and storage systems that must be unified into a coherent data layer. The XDR correlation engine depends on clean, normalized, low-latency data from multiple security domains.

Under STG ownership, Trellix invests in data infrastructure to power its XDR vision. Data Engineers who can unify diverse security data sources into a single analytical framework solve one of the core challenges of the McAfee+FireEye integration.

#### Trellix Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Data Engineer | 2–6 years |
| L5 | Senior Data Engineer | 6–10 years |
| L6 | Staff / Principal Data Engineer | 10–15 years |

#### Lever 1: Multi-Source Data Unification

"Trellix's XDR platform ingests data from endpoints, networks, email, and cloud. I bring expertise in normalizing and correlating diverse data sources — the core data engineering challenge behind XDR."

#### Lever 2: Post-Merger Data Integration

"Unifying McAfee Enterprise and FireEye data architectures is one of the most complex data integration projects in cybersecurity. My experience with large-scale data migration and schema evolution directly supports this initiative."

#### Lever 3: Real-Time Correlation Pipeline

"XDR correlation requires real-time data processing with strict latency requirements. My experience building streaming data pipelines ensures Trellix's correlation engine receives data fast enough to detect threats in progress."

#### Lever 4: Threat Intelligence Data Infrastructure

"Trellix's Threat Intelligence Group generates vast amounts of threat data. I build the infrastructure that makes this intelligence queryable and actionable at platform scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $165,000 base with equity valued at $45K-$65K/year. Accept-at floor: $215,000 total comp. Cite the multi-source data unification challenge and post-merger integration complexity.
