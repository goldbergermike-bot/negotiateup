### Data Scientist — Trellix Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Scientists at Trellix develop the detection models, behavioral analytics, and threat scoring algorithms that power the XDR platform's ability to identify sophisticated multi-stage attacks across endpoint, network, email, and cloud domains.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Milpitas/Bay Area (USD) | Remote US (USD) | Bangalore (INR) |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $148,000–$203,000 | $133,000–$188,000 | ₹20,00,000–₹35,00,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $200,000–$268,000 | $185,000–$250,000 | ₹35,00,000–₹55,00,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $263,000–$340,000 | $245,000–$318,000 | ₹55,00,000–₹85,00,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, equity (phantom equity under STG), and performance bonus (10%).*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Trellix

Data Scientists at Trellix benefit from one of the richest threat intelligence datasets in the industry — combining McAfee Enterprise telemetry with FireEye/Mandiant threat research. The XDR platform requires detection models that correlate signals across multiple security domains, a significantly harder ML problem than single-domain detection.

#### Trellix Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | Data Scientist | 2–5 years |
| L5 | Senior Data Scientist | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff / Principal Data Scientist | 8–14 years |

#### Lever 1: Cross-Domain Detection Models

"XDR detection requires models that correlate signals across endpoint, network, email, and cloud. My multi-domain modeling expertise enables the cross-correlation that makes XDR more effective than point solutions."

#### Lever 2: FireEye Threat Intelligence Dataset

"Trellix inherits FireEye/Mandiant's threat intelligence — one of the richest datasets in cybersecurity. My ability to leverage this dataset for model training creates detection capabilities no competitor can easily replicate."

#### Lever 3: Attack Chain Detection

"Sophisticated attacks unfold across multiple stages and domains. I build models that detect attack chains by identifying patterns across temporally and spatially distributed security events."

#### Lever 4: ML Talent Scarcity

"Data scientists with cross-domain security detection experience are exceptionally rare. My combined ML expertise and security knowledge commands a premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $163,000 base with equity valued at $45K-$65K/year. Accept-at floor: $215,000 total comp. Cite cross-domain detection expertise and the unique FireEye threat intelligence advantage.
