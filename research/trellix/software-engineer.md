#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Trellix

Trellix was formed in 2022 from the merger of McAfee Enterprise and FireEye under Symphony Technology Group (STG) ownership. Headquartered in Milpitas, CA, Trellix combines McAfee's enterprise endpoint and network security heritage with FireEye's legendary threat intelligence and incident response capabilities. The company's XDR platform unifies endpoint, network, email, and cloud security into a single detection and response framework.

Software Engineers at Trellix work on integrating and modernizing two massive security product portfolios — a complex engineering challenge that includes migrating legacy architectures, building unified data models, and creating the XDR correlation engine that ties diverse security signals together. The company's Threat Intelligence Group (formerly Mandiant/FireEye research) provides world-class threat intelligence that engineers integrate into the platform.

Trellix competes for Bay Area talent against major cybersecurity and tech companies. As a private company under STG, candidates should negotiate aggressively on base salary while understanding the equity structure.
