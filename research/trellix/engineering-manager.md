#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Trellix

EMs at Trellix manage teams merging from two distinct engineering cultures (McAfee Enterprise and FireEye). This requires exceptional people leadership — unifying teams, resolving cultural differences, and maintaining delivery velocity during a period of significant organizational change. Under STG ownership, EMs balance integration execution with product innovation.
