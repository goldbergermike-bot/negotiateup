#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Trellix

Senior SWEs at Trellix lead the technical integration work that defines the company's future.

#### Lever 1: Platform Integration Leadership

"Integrating McAfee Enterprise and FireEye into the Trellix XDR platform is a defining engineering challenge. My experience with large-scale platform migrations and system integration provides immediate impact."

#### Lever 2: XDR Detection Engine

"The XDR correlation engine must tie signals across endpoint, network, email, and cloud. I bring experience building cross-domain detection systems that create the unified view Trellix's XDR platform requires."

#### Lever 3: Legacy Modernization

"Trellix's codebase spans decades of McAfee and FireEye development. My ability to modernize legacy systems while maintaining reliability accelerates Trellix's platform evolution."

#### Lever 4: Competitive Compensation

"I'm evaluating offers at public cybersecurity companies where RSUs provide immediate liquidity. Trellix's private equity structure means I need base salary compensation that reflects the illiquidity discount."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $178,000 base with equity valued at $50K-$70K/year. Accept-at floor: $240,000 total comp. Emphasize integration expertise and illiquidity discount.
