#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Trellix

TPMs at Trellix manage some of the most complex programs in cybersecurity — the post-merger integration of two major product portfolios. Programs span platform integration, product consolidation, customer migration, and compliance certification. Under STG, execution discipline is paramount.

#### Lever 1: Post-Merger Integration Programs

"The McAfee Enterprise + FireEye integration is one of the largest program management challenges in cybersecurity. My experience leading post-merger integration programs ensures execution discipline during this critical period."

#### Lever 2: Multi-Product Delivery Coordination

"Trellix ships across endpoint, network, email, and cloud products with complex interdependencies. My cross-product program management ensures coordinated delivery."

#### Lever 3: STG Execution Standards

"STG demands rigorous program execution. My methodology — milestone accountability, risk management, and data-driven reporting — meets portfolio company standards."

#### Lever 4: Customer Migration Programs

"Migrating existing McAfee and FireEye customers to the unified Trellix platform requires careful program management. I bring experience managing large-scale customer transition programs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $160,000 base with equity valued at $40K-$60K/year. Accept-at floor: $210,000 total comp. Cite post-merger integration program expertise and execution discipline.
