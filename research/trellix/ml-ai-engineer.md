### ML/AI Engineer — Trellix Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers at Trellix build the machine learning models that power cross-domain threat detection in the XDR platform, leveraging the combined McAfee Enterprise telemetry and FireEye threat intelligence to detect sophisticated multi-stage attacks.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Milpitas/Bay Area (USD) | Remote US (USD) | Bangalore (INR) |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $155,000–$215,000 | $140,000–$198,000 | ₹22,00,000–₹38,00,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $210,000–$278,000 | $195,000–$260,000 | ₹38,00,000–₹60,00,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $273,000–$350,000 | $255,000–$328,000 | ₹58,00,000–₹92,00,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, equity (phantom equity under STG), and performance bonus (10%). ML/AI roles command a 5-10% premium over general SWE.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Trellix

ML/AI Engineers at Trellix work with one of the richest security datasets in the industry. The XDR platform requires ML models that detect threats across endpoint, network, email, and cloud domains simultaneously — a significantly harder ML problem than single-domain detection. Trellix inherits FireEye/Mandiant's threat intelligence, providing uniquely labeled training data.

#### Trellix Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3-L4 | ML Engineer | 2–5 years |
| L5 | Senior ML Engineer | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff ML Engineer | 8–12 years |

#### Lever 1: Cross-Domain XDR Detection

"Building ML models for XDR requires understanding detection across multiple security domains simultaneously. My cross-domain ML expertise enables the correlated detection that differentiates XDR from point solutions."

#### Lever 2: FireEye/Mandiant Intelligence Training Data

"Trellix's inherited FireEye/Mandiant threat intelligence provides uniquely labeled training data. I can leverage this dataset to build detection models that competitors cannot easily replicate."

#### Lever 3: Attack Chain ML Models

"Detecting multi-stage attacks requires temporal and cross-domain modeling. I bring expertise in sequence models, graph neural networks, and multi-signal fusion applicable to attack chain detection."

#### Lever 4: ML Talent Premium

"ML engineers with cross-domain security expertise are extremely scarce. Trellix's offer must reflect both the ML talent premium and my security domain specialization."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $173,000 base with equity valued at $50K-$70K/year. Accept-at floor: $230,000 total comp. Leverage cross-domain ML expertise and the FireEye intelligence advantage.
