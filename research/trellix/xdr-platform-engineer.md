### XDR Platform Engineer — Trellix Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: XDR Platform Engineers at Trellix build the core extended detection and response platform that unifies endpoint security (from McAfee Enterprise), network security, email security, and cloud security with FireEye's world-class threat intelligence into a single correlated detection and response framework.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Milpitas/Bay Area (USD) | Remote US (USD) | Bangalore (INR) |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $150,000–$208,000 | $135,000–$193,000 | ₹22,00,000–₹38,00,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $205,000–$273,000 | $190,000–$255,000 | ₹38,00,000–₹60,00,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $268,000–$345,000 | $250,000–$323,000 | ₹58,00,000–₹90,00,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, equity (phantom equity / profit-sharing units under Symphony Technology Group ownership, 4-year vest), and performance bonus (typically 10%). XDR Platform roles command a 5-8% premium over general SWE due to specialized detection correlation and multi-domain security expertise.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Trellix

This is the signature engineering role at Trellix. XDR Platform Engineers build the correlation engine, data fusion layer, and response orchestration framework that defines the Trellix platform. XDR (Extended Detection and Response) is the company's core product vision — creating a platform where signals from endpoints, networks, email, and cloud environments are automatically correlated to detect sophisticated multi-stage attacks that point solutions miss.

Trellix was formed in 2022 by Symphony Technology Group from the merger of McAfee Enterprise (decades of endpoint and network security technology) and FireEye (industry-leading threat intelligence and incident response). Headquartered in Milpitas, CA, Trellix inherits massive codebases, diverse detection engines, and extensive customer deployments. XDR Platform Engineers integrate these into a cohesive platform.

The role requires expertise in distributed systems, event correlation, security data modeling, and multi-domain detection logic. This combination of systems engineering and security domain knowledge is rare and directly tied to Trellix's competitive differentiation.

#### Trellix Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3 | XDR Platform Engineer | 1–3 years |
| L4 | XDR Platform Engineer II | 3–5 years |
| L5 | Senior XDR Platform Engineer | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff XDR Platform Engineer | 8–12 years |
| L7 | Principal XDR Platform Engineer | 12+ years |

#### Lever 1: XDR Correlation Engine

"The XDR correlation engine is Trellix's core technology — fusing signals across endpoint, network, email, and cloud to detect multi-stage attacks. I bring experience building event correlation systems that process high-volume, multi-source security data with low latency and high accuracy."

#### Lever 2: McAfee + FireEye Technology Integration

"Trellix's competitive advantage comes from combining McAfee Enterprise's detection technology with FireEye's threat intelligence. I bring experience integrating diverse security technologies into unified platforms — the defining engineering challenge at Trellix."

#### Lever 3: Threat Intelligence Operationalization

"Trellix's Threat Intelligence Group (formerly Mandiant/FireEye research) produces world-class threat intelligence. I build the systems that operationalize this intelligence into automated detection rules and response playbooks — turning research into real-time protection."

#### Lever 4: Multi-Domain Security Expertise

"XDR requires understanding detection across endpoint, network, email, and cloud domains. My cross-domain security expertise enables me to build correlation logic that identifies attacks spanning multiple security layers — the core value proposition of XDR."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $170,000 base with equity valued at $50K-$70K/year. Accept-at floor: $225,000 total comp. Cite the specialized nature of XDR platform engineering, the McAfee+FireEye integration opportunity, and the STG growth mandate.
