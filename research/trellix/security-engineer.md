### Security Engineer — Trellix Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers at Trellix protect the infrastructure and products of the XDR platform formed from McAfee Enterprise and FireEye — maintaining the security posture expected of a company that inherits two of cybersecurity's most recognized brands.

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Trellix

A breach at Trellix — inheritor of McAfee and FireEye — would be devastating. Security Engineers carry the existential responsibility of protecting two merged infrastructures while the company integrates its systems. The attack surface during merger integration is particularly elevated.

#### Lever 1: Post-Merger Security Integration

"Merging two security companies' infrastructure creates an expanded attack surface. My experience securing organizations during merger integration reduces this elevated risk."

#### Lever 2: Protecting the XDR Platform

"Trellix's XDR platform processes customers' most sensitive security data. My application and infrastructure security expertise protects both Trellix and its customers."

#### Lever 3: Brand Protection

"McAfee and FireEye are iconic cybersecurity brands. A breach would damage decades of brand trust. My security engineering skills directly protect this invaluable asset."

#### Lever 4: Security Talent Premium

"Security engineers at security companies command a premium. The post-merger complexity adds additional risk that my skills mitigate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $165,000 base with equity valued at $45K-$65K/year. Accept-at floor: $215,000 total comp. Cite post-merger security complexity and brand protection stakes.
