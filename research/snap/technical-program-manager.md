**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Snap orchestrate complex cross-functional programs spanning engineering, product, design, and operations — coordinating the delivery of features and infrastructure that serve 800M+ monthly active users across Snapchat's camera, messaging, and AR platforms. The January 2026 Specs Inc. spin-out has created an extraordinary demand for TPMs who can manage the inherent complexity of hardware-software integration programs: coordinating between chip design, optics, firmware, OS development, cloud services, and app development on aggressive shipping timelines. The 100-role hiring sprint is itself a massive program that needs TPM coordination — Specs Inc. needs TPMs who can simultaneously manage the hiring program and the product programs being staffed.

**Level Mapping:** Snap Technical Program Manager (L4–L6) = Google TPM L4-L6 = Meta TPM IC4-IC6 = Apple Engineering Program Manager = Amazon Sr. TPM – Principal TPM = Microsoft TPM (62-65)

**Specs Inc. Spin-Out — Spin-Out Premium**

Snap spun out its AR hardware division as Specs Inc. on January 28, 2026 — creating a standalone company focused on AR glasses and spatial computing. The 100-role hiring sprint for Specs Inc. creates extraordinary negotiation leverage. "As a Technical Program Manager, you are the connective tissue that holds Specs Inc.'s ambitious AR hardware program together. AR glasses require the most complex hardware-software integration in consumer electronics — optics, displays, sensors, chips, firmware, operating systems, cloud services, and apps must all ship in sync. Without TPMs who can manage this multi-dimensional coordination, Specs Inc.'s product timeline collapses. Candidates should argue for: (1) Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity allocation in addition to Snap RSUs — TPMs who coordinate the delivery of Specs Inc.'s flagship product have direct impact on whether the company ships on time and succeeds as a business, (2) a Spin-Out Premium of 15–25% above standard Snap TPM comp to reflect the hardware-software integration complexity and the startup environment where TPMs wear multiple hats, (3) sign-on bonuses of $28K–$48K to match competing offers from established hardware companies with lower execution risk. Frame it as: Specs Inc. needs to compete with Meta Reality Labs, Apple Vision Pro, and Magic Leap for AR talent — the premium is the cost of building a world-class AR team from scratch." Push for $28K–$48K Spin-Out Premium sign-ons.

**Global Levers**

1. **Specs Inc. Spin-Out Premium:** "At Specs Inc., I'm not managing a single software program — I'm coordinating the delivery of an AR hardware product that integrates optics, silicon, firmware, OS, cloud, and apps. That hardware-software complexity is 3-5x the coordination load of a typical software TPM role, and my comp should reflect it. I need Snap RSUs plus meaningful Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity."
2. **100-Role Hiring Sprint:** "The 100-role hiring sprint is itself a complex program that needs TPM coordination — tracking candidate pipelines, onboarding timelines, team formation, and resource allocation. Specs Inc. needs TPMs who can manage both the hiring program and the product programs simultaneously. That dual-program load commands premium comp."
3. **AR/Spatial Computing Race:** "AR hardware programs are the most complex in consumer electronics — they combine the challenges of chip design (Apple), optics manufacturing (Zeiss), software platforms (Google), and consumer products (Samsung). TPMs who can coordinate across all these domains are extremely rare. My experience in [relevant hardware/software programs] makes me one of a very small pool of qualified candidates."
4. **Program Velocity as Competitive Advantage:** "In the AR race, shipping first with a great product wins. The TPM determines whether Specs Inc. ships on schedule or slips by quarters. At a 100-person company, a quarter of delay can be existential. My program management velocity directly translates to competitive advantage, and my comp should reflect that outsized impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $175K base and $215K RSUs over 4 years, plus Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity and a $38K Spin-Out Premium sign-on, for this Technical Program Manager position. The Specs Inc. spin-out means I'd be coordinating the delivery of AR glasses — a hardware-software integration challenge that is orders of magnitude more complex than managing software-only programs. The 100-role sprint adds a second dimension of program complexity. I have competing offers from Meta Reality Labs at $260K TC and Apple at $255K TC." Accept at $162K+ base and $190K+ RSUs.
