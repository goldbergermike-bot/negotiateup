**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Snap lead teams of 6-12 engineers building the systems behind Snapchat's camera platform, AR Lenses, messaging infrastructure, and content surfaces — all serving 800M+ monthly active users with demanding real-time performance requirements. The January 2026 Specs Inc. spin-out has created an unprecedented demand for Engineering Managers who can simultaneously build high-performing teams from scratch and ship AR hardware products on aggressive timelines. The 100-role hiring sprint makes EMs the linchpin of Specs Inc.'s success — they are the ones who will recruit, onboard, and organize the engineers who build AR glasses, making their team-building expertise worth a significant premium.

**Level Mapping:** Snap Engineering Manager (M1–M2) = Google L5-L6 Manager = Meta M1-M2 = Apple Engineering Manager = Amazon SDM = Microsoft Engineering Manager (64-66)

**Specs Inc. Spin-Out — Spin-Out Premium**

Snap spun out its AR hardware division as Specs Inc. on January 28, 2026 — creating a standalone company focused on AR glasses and spatial computing. The 100-role hiring sprint for Specs Inc. creates extraordinary negotiation leverage. "As an Engineering Manager, you are the human infrastructure Specs Inc. cannot function without. The 100-role hiring sprint means EMs will be hiring, onboarding, and organizing engineers at a pace that defines whether Specs Inc. succeeds or fails as an independent company. You're not managing an existing team — you're building one from zero while simultaneously shipping product. Candidates should argue for: (1) Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity allocation in addition to Snap RSUs — your team-building efforts directly determine Specs Inc.'s ability to ship AR glasses, and your equity should reflect that foundational contribution, (2) a Spin-Out Premium of 15–25% above standard Snap EM comp to reflect the dual responsibility of hiring at sprint pace while maintaining engineering velocity, (3) sign-on bonuses of $50K–$80K to cover the opportunity cost of leaving established management roles at larger companies where teams are already built. Frame it as: Specs Inc. needs to compete with Meta Reality Labs, Apple Vision Pro, and Magic Leap for AR talent — the premium is the cost of building a world-class AR team from scratch." Push for $50K–$80K Spin-Out Premium sign-ons.

**Global Levers**

1. **Specs Inc. Spin-Out Premium:** "As an EM at Specs Inc., I'm not inheriting a team — I'm building one from the ground up during a 100-role hiring sprint. The Specs Inc. equity allocation should reflect the fact that my hiring decisions will determine the quality of the entire engineering organization. I need Snap RSUs for stability plus a meaningful Specs Inc. pre-IPO grant that scales with the team I build."
2. **100-Role Hiring Sprint:** "Filling 100 roles in a year requires EMs who can run hiring pipelines, close candidates, and onboard engineers simultaneously — all while shipping product. That's a dual-operating-mode that commands premium comp. My hiring track record speaks directly to Specs Inc.'s ability to meet its headcount targets."
3. **AR/Spatial Computing Race:** "Meta Reality Labs has hundreds of engineering managers with years of AR-specific experience. Apple Vision Pro was built by managers who've been in spatial computing for a decade. Specs Inc. is starting fresh — the EMs you hire now set the engineering culture and team topology for the entire company. That foundational influence justifies above-market comp."
4. **Team-Building Multiplier Effect:** "Every engineer I successfully hire and ramp up multiplies Specs Inc.'s engineering output. At a 100-person company, an EM managing 8-10 engineers controls 8-10% of total engineering capacity. That concentration of influence on company outcomes should be reflected in both equity and bonus structures."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $248K base and $380K RSUs over 4 years, plus Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity and a $65K Spin-Out Premium sign-on, for this Engineering Manager position. The Specs Inc. spin-out means I'd be building an engineering team from zero during the 100-role hiring sprint — that's fundamentally different from backfilling a role on an existing team. I have competing offers from Meta Reality Labs at $385K TC and Google AR at $370K TC, where the teams are already established. The Specs Inc. equity upside needs to compensate for the higher execution risk." Accept at $230K+ base and $340K+ RSUs.
