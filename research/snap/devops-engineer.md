### DevOps Engineer | Snap Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy RSU Structure | Camera & AR Platform | Specs Inc. Spin-Out (Jan 2026) | 100-Role Hiring Sprint | Infrastructure & Reliability Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Los Angeles | $145K–$182K | $140K–$235K | 10–15% | $192K–$258K |
| San Francisco | $153K–$192K | $148K–$248K | 10–15% | $203K–$274K |
| New York | $150K–$188K | $145K–$242K | 10–15% | $200K–$268K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Snap build and maintain the infrastructure that keeps Snapchat running for 800M+ monthly active users — managing CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, monitoring systems, and deployment automation at massive scale. The January 2026 Specs Inc. spin-out has created an urgent need for DevOps engineers who can build Specs Inc.'s entire infrastructure stack from the ground up — a greenfield opportunity to design CI/CD, deployment, monitoring, and cloud architecture for an AR hardware company. The 100-role hiring sprint means every engineer hired at Specs Inc. needs infrastructure to build and deploy on, making DevOps one of the first capabilities that must be established.

**Level Mapping:** Snap DevOps Engineer (L3–L6) = Google Site Reliability Engineer L3-L6 = Meta Production Engineer IC3-IC6 = Apple DevOps/SRE = Amazon Systems Engineer = Microsoft DevOps Engineer (59-64)

**Specs Inc. Spin-Out — Spin-Out Premium**

Snap spun out its AR hardware division as Specs Inc. on January 28, 2026 — creating a standalone company focused on AR glasses and spatial computing. The 100-role hiring sprint for Specs Inc. creates extraordinary negotiation leverage. "As a DevOps Engineer, you are the foundation layer that every other Specs Inc. hire depends on. Before engineers can write code, before designers can prototype, before PMs can ship features — someone needs to build the infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, cloud architecture, and deployment systems. That someone is DevOps, and at a 100-person company, you'll own the entire stack. Candidates should argue for: (1) Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity allocation in addition to Snap RSUs — DevOps engineers who build the infrastructure for an entire company from day one have foundational impact that should be reflected in founding-level equity, (2) a Spin-Out Premium of 15–25% above standard Snap DevOps comp to reflect the breadth of ownership (you'll own all of infrastructure, not just one subsystem) and the startup risk of joining a new AR hardware venture, (3) sign-on bonuses of $30K–$50K to offset the security of established infrastructure roles at larger companies. Frame it as: Specs Inc. needs to compete with Meta Reality Labs, Apple Vision Pro, and Magic Leap for AR talent — the premium is the cost of building a world-class AR team from scratch." Push for $30K–$50K Spin-Out Premium sign-ons.

**Global Levers**

1. **Specs Inc. Spin-Out Premium:** "Building Specs Inc.'s infrastructure from zero is a fundamentally different challenge than maintaining Snap's existing systems. I need dual equity (Snap RSUs plus Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity) to reflect the fact that my infrastructure decisions will be the foundation every other engineer builds on — if I get it right, the entire company moves faster."
2. **100-Role Hiring Sprint:** "The 100-role hiring sprint creates an immediate dependency on DevOps — every new engineer needs development environments, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment infrastructure from day one. I need to be one of the earliest hires, and my comp should reflect the urgency and the force-multiplier effect of enabling 100 other engineers."
3. **AR/Spatial Computing Race:** "AR hardware requires unique DevOps challenges — firmware deployment pipelines, over-the-air update systems, edge computing infrastructure, and hardware-software integration testing. DevOps engineers with hardware platform experience are extremely scarce, and Specs Inc. is competing with Meta, Apple, and Google for this small talent pool."
4. **Greenfield Infrastructure Ownership:** "At Specs Inc., I won't be maintaining someone else's infrastructure — I'll be designing and building the entire stack. That level of architectural ownership and decision-making authority is typically reserved for principal-level engineers at larger companies, and my comp should reflect the seniority of the responsibility."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $175K base and $220K RSUs over 4 years, plus Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity and a $40K Spin-Out Premium sign-on, for this DevOps Engineer position. At Specs Inc., I'd be building the entire infrastructure stack from zero — CI/CD, cloud architecture, monitoring, deployment — which is a principal-level scope at a big tech company. The 100-role sprint means every engineer hired after me depends on the infrastructure I build. I have competing offers from Meta at $260K TC and Google at $255K TC." Accept at $162K+ base and $195K+ RSUs.
