### Solutions Architect | Snap Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy RSU Structure | Camera & AR Platform | Specs Inc. Spin-Out (Jan 2026) | 100-Role Hiring Sprint | AR Platform Integration Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Los Angeles | $148K–$188K | $145K–$240K | 10–15% | $195K–$265K |
| San Francisco | $156K–$198K | $152K–$252K | 10–15% | $206K–$280K |
| New York | $153K–$195K | $150K–$248K | 10–15% | $202K–$276K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Snap design and implement the technical integrations that connect Snapchat's platform with enterprise partners, ad tech systems, developer ecosystems, and AR Lens creation tools — enabling the business models that monetize 800M+ monthly active users. The January 2026 Specs Inc. spin-out has created a massive new surface area for solutions architecture: designing how third-party developers, enterprise customers, and AR content creators integrate with the Spectacles platform. The 100-role hiring sprint means Specs Inc. needs Solutions Architects who can define the developer ecosystem, partner integrations, and platform APIs for AR glasses from day one — a strategic role that determines whether Specs Inc. can build a thriving AR platform or remain a standalone hardware product.

**Level Mapping:** Snap Solutions Architect (L4–L6) = Google Cloud Solutions Architect = Meta Solutions Engineer = Apple Platform Architect = Amazon Solutions Architect = Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect (62-65)

**Specs Inc. Spin-Out — Spin-Out Premium**

Snap spun out its AR hardware division as Specs Inc. on January 28, 2026 — creating a standalone company focused on AR glasses and spatial computing. The 100-role hiring sprint for Specs Inc. creates extraordinary negotiation leverage. "As a Solutions Architect, you will design how the Specs Inc. AR platform integrates with the broader technology ecosystem — developer tools, enterprise applications, content creation platforms, and third-party hardware. The success of AR glasses depends not just on the hardware but on the ecosystem built around it, and Solutions Architects define that ecosystem architecture. Candidates should argue for: (1) Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity allocation in addition to Snap RSUs — Solutions Architects who design the platform integration layer have strategic impact on Specs Inc.'s ecosystem play and long-term revenue model, (2) a Spin-Out Premium of 15–25% above standard Snap SA comp to reflect the novelty of designing AR platform integrations and the scarcity of architects with spatial computing ecosystem experience, (3) sign-on bonuses of $28K–$48K to match competing offers from cloud platforms and enterprise AR companies. Frame it as: Specs Inc. needs to compete with Meta Reality Labs, Apple Vision Pro, and Magic Leap for AR talent — the premium is the cost of building a world-class AR team from scratch." Push for $28K–$48K Spin-Out Premium sign-ons.

**Global Levers**

1. **Specs Inc. Spin-Out Premium:** "The Specs Inc. spin-out means I'd be architecting the integration layer between AR glasses and the entire technology ecosystem. That's a platform-defining role — the APIs, partner integrations, and developer tools I design will determine whether Specs Inc. becomes a platform or just a product. I need Snap RSUs plus Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity that reflects this strategic ecosystem impact."
2. **100-Role Hiring Sprint:** "The 100-role sprint will produce engineers who need architectural guidance on how to build integrations. Solutions Architects provide the blueprints that accelerate the entire team. Hiring me early in the sprint means faster ramp for every engineer who follows, creating a force-multiplier effect on Specs Inc.'s hiring investment."
3. **AR/Spatial Computing Race:** "Apple, Meta, and Google are all building AR developer platforms. The Solutions Architect who designs Specs Inc.'s developer experience and partner integrations directly determines whether developers build for Specs or for competitors. That competitive importance commands premium comp — Specs Inc. can't afford to lose the platform architecture race."
4. **Cross-Platform Integration Expertise:** "AR glasses must integrate with mobile apps, cloud services, enterprise systems, and IoT devices. Solutions Architects with cross-platform integration experience are rare — most architects specialize in a single domain. My breadth of integration expertise across [relevant platforms] is exactly what Specs Inc. needs to build a universal AR platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $182K base and $225K RSUs over 4 years, plus Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity and a $38K Spin-Out Premium sign-on, for this Solutions Architect position. At Specs Inc., I'd be designing the integration architecture that determines whether AR glasses become a platform with a thriving developer ecosystem. The 100-role hiring sprint means architectural decisions must be made immediately — and I have the cross-platform expertise to make them well. I have competing offers from AWS at $270K TC and Google Cloud at $262K TC." Accept at $168K+ base and $200K+ RSUs.
