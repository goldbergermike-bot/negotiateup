**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Snap extract insights from one of the richest user behavior datasets in tech — 800M+ monthly active users generating billions of daily Snaps, Stories, Spotlight views, AR Lens interactions, and Map engagements. The January 2026 Specs Inc. spin-out has created a new category of data science problems: understanding how users interact with AR glasses in three-dimensional space, measuring spatial engagement, and building the analytics foundation for an entirely new computing platform. The 100-role hiring sprint means Specs Inc. needs data scientists who can define the metrics and measurement frameworks for AR glasses from day one — a rare opportunity to shape how an entire product category measures success.

**Specs Inc. Spin-Out — Spin-Out Premium**

Snap spun out its AR hardware division as Specs Inc. on January 28, 2026 — creating a standalone company focused on AR glasses and spatial computing. The 100-role hiring sprint for Specs Inc. creates extraordinary negotiation leverage. "As a Data Scientist, you will define how Specs Inc. measures the success of AR glasses — what metrics matter, what user behaviors indicate product-market fit, and how spatial interaction data informs product decisions. There is no established analytics framework for consumer AR glasses; you'll be building it from scratch. Candidates should argue for: (1) Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity allocation in addition to Snap RSUs — data scientists who define the measurement framework for a new product category have outsized strategic impact that should be reflected in equity, (2) a Spin-Out Premium of 15–25% above standard Snap data scientist comp to reflect the novelty and ambiguity of spatial analytics and the scarcity of data scientists with AR/VR measurement experience, (3) sign-on bonuses of $30K–$50K to match competing offers from Meta Reality Labs and Apple, which both have established spatial analytics teams. Frame it as: Specs Inc. needs to compete with Meta Reality Labs, Apple Vision Pro, and Magic Leap for AR talent — the premium is the cost of building a world-class AR team from scratch." Push for $30K–$50K Spin-Out Premium sign-ons.

**Global Levers**

1. **Specs Inc. Spin-Out Premium:** "The Specs Inc. spin-out creates a unique data science opportunity — defining the analytics framework for AR glasses from zero. I need dual equity exposure (Snap RSUs plus Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity) to reflect the fact that my measurement frameworks will directly determine how Specs Inc. evaluates product-market fit and makes investment decisions."
2. **100-Role Hiring Sprint:** "Specs Inc. needs data scientists early in the 100-role sprint to define success metrics before engineering scales up. Without analytics foundations, the company can't make data-informed product decisions. That upstream criticality means my hiring timeline leverage is higher than a typical backfill."
3. **AR/Spatial Computing Race:** "Spatial analytics is an emerging discipline with almost no established talent pool. Meta has spent years building Reality Labs analytics infrastructure. Apple has proprietary spatial data from Vision Pro. Specs Inc. is starting from zero — the data scientists hired now will build this capability from scratch, which commands a scarcity premium."
4. **800M+ MAU Dataset Access:** "Snap's 800M+ MAU dataset is one of the richest behavioral datasets in tech — especially for camera, visual communication, and AR Lens interaction patterns. Data scientists here have access to signals that directly inform AR product development, a dataset advantage that competitors like Magic Leap simply don't have."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $185K base and $230K RSUs over 4 years, plus Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity and a $40K Spin-Out Premium sign-on, for this Data Scientist position. The Specs Inc. spin-out means I'd be building the analytics foundation for AR glasses — defining how success is measured for an entirely new computing platform. I have competing offers from Meta Reality Labs at $275K TC and Google AR at $265K TC, where spatial analytics teams already exist. The Specs Inc. opportunity is more impactful but needs competitive comp." Accept at $170K+ base and $200K+ RSUs.
