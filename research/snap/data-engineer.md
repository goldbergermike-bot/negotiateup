### Data Engineer | Snap Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy RSU Structure | Camera & AR Platform | Specs Inc. Spin-Out (Jan 2026) | 100-Role Hiring Sprint | Spatial Data Pipeline Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Los Angeles | $142K–$180K | $138K–$230K | 10–15% | $188K–$255K |
| San Francisco | $150K–$190K | $146K–$242K | 10–15% | $198K–$270K |
| New York | $148K–$186K | $142K–$238K | 10–15% | $195K–$265K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Snap build and maintain the data infrastructure that processes billions of daily events from 800M+ monthly active users — ingesting Snaps, Stories, Spotlight views, AR Lens interactions, Map data, and ad engagement signals into real-time and batch pipelines that power product analytics, machine learning models, and business intelligence. The January 2026 Specs Inc. spin-out has created a greenfield data engineering challenge: building the data pipeline infrastructure for an entirely new category of spatial computing data — 3D spatial maps, eye tracking telemetry, hand gesture data, AR overlay interactions, and real-time sensor fusion streams. The 100-role hiring sprint means Specs Inc. needs data engineers who can design and build these novel data systems from scratch, before any meaningful analytics or ML work can begin.

**Level Mapping:** Snap Data Engineer (L3–L6) = Google Data Engineer L3-L6 = Meta Data Engineer IC3-IC6 = Apple Data Engineer = Amazon Data Engineer = Microsoft Data Engineer (59-64)

**Specs Inc. Spin-Out — Spin-Out Premium**

Snap spun out its AR hardware division as Specs Inc. on January 28, 2026 — creating a standalone company focused on AR glasses and spatial computing. The 100-role hiring sprint for Specs Inc. creates extraordinary negotiation leverage. "As a Data Engineer, you will build the data infrastructure that makes every other function at Specs Inc. possible — ML engineers can't train models without data pipelines, data scientists can't analyze user behavior without data warehouses, product managers can't make decisions without metrics, and the AR glasses themselves can't improve without feedback loops from user data. At Specs Inc., the data engineering challenge is uniquely complex: spatial computing generates novel data types (3D point clouds, eye gaze vectors, hand gesture sequences, spatial anchors) that don't fit neatly into existing data infrastructure paradigms. Candidates should argue for: (1) Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity allocation in addition to Snap RSUs — data engineers who build the foundational data infrastructure for an entire company have outsized impact on every team's velocity, (2) a Spin-Out Premium of 15–25% above standard Snap data engineer comp to reflect the novelty of spatial data pipelines and the greenfield complexity of designing data systems for data types that barely exist today, (3) sign-on bonuses of $28K–$48K to match competing offers from companies with established data infrastructure. Frame it as: Specs Inc. needs to compete with Meta Reality Labs, Apple Vision Pro, and Magic Leap for AR talent — the premium is the cost of building a world-class AR team from scratch." Push for $28K–$48K Spin-Out Premium sign-ons.

**Global Levers**

1. **Specs Inc. Spin-Out Premium:** "The Specs Inc. spin-out means I'd be building data infrastructure for entirely new data types — 3D spatial maps, eye tracking streams, hand gesture sequences. There's no existing playbook for ingesting, processing, and serving spatial computing data at scale. That novelty premium, plus dual equity exposure (Snap RSUs and Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity), should reflect the foundational nature of data infrastructure."
2. **100-Role Hiring Sprint:** "Data infrastructure is a blocking dependency for every other team at Specs Inc. ML engineers can't train AR models without data pipelines. Product analytics can't measure success without data warehouses. The 100-role sprint creates urgency to hire data engineers first, and that upstream criticality translates to premium comp."
3. **AR/Spatial Computing Race:** "Spatial data engineering is an emerging discipline. The data types generated by AR glasses — point clouds, depth maps, gaze vectors, spatial anchors — require new approaches to storage, processing, and querying. Data engineers who can design systems for these novel data types are extremely rare. My experience in [relevant area] is directly applicable."
4. **Data as Competitive Moat:** "The company that builds the best spatial data infrastructure will have the best AR models, the best user experience insights, and the fastest product iteration loop. Data engineering is the competitive moat for Specs Inc. — and investing in data engineers early is how you build that moat. My infrastructure decisions will compound over years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $172K base and $210K RSUs over 4 years, plus Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity and a $38K Spin-Out Premium sign-on, for this Data Engineer position. The Specs Inc. spin-out means I'd be designing data infrastructure for spatial computing data types that don't have established patterns — 3D point clouds, gaze tracking, spatial anchors. That novelty factor, plus the 100-role sprint urgency, commands premium comp. I have competing offers from Meta at $255K TC and Snowflake at $250K TC." Accept at $160K+ base and $188K+ RSUs.
