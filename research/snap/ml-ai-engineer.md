### ML/AI Engineer | Snap Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy RSU Structure | Camera & AR Platform | Specs Inc. Spin-Out (Jan 2026) | 100-Role Hiring Sprint | **+15–25% AI Premium** | AR/ML Dual Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Los Angeles | $180K–$235K | $220K–$380K | 12–18% | $242K–$335K |
| San Francisco | $190K–$248K | $232K–$400K | 12–18% | $256K–$355K |
| New York | $186K–$242K | $228K–$392K | 12–18% | $250K–$348K |

> **AI Premium Note:** All comp ranges include a +15–25% AI Premium above standard engineering bands. ML/AI engineers at Snap command above-market comp due to extreme talent scarcity, the AI arms race across big tech, and the critical role of ML in Snap's camera, AR Lens, and content recommendation systems.

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Snap build the machine learning systems that power Snapchat's most differentiated features — real-time AR Lens effects using computer vision, content recommendation algorithms for Spotlight and Discover, camera enhancement models, NLP for messaging, and generative AI for Lens creation, all serving 800M+ monthly active users. The January 2026 Specs Inc. spin-out has created an unprecedented demand for ML/AI engineers who can build the real-time on-device ML models that make AR glasses actually work — hand tracking, eye tracking, spatial mapping, object recognition, scene understanding, and gesture recognition, all running on power-constrained edge hardware. The 100-role hiring sprint means Specs Inc. is competing directly with OpenAI, Meta FAIR, Google DeepMind, Apple ML Research, and every AI startup for ML talent, driving comp to all-time highs.

**Level Mapping:** Snap ML/AI Engineer (L3–L6) = Google ML Engineer L3-L6 = Meta ML Engineer IC3-IC6 = Apple ML Engineer = Amazon Applied Scientist = Microsoft ML Engineer (59-64)

**Specs Inc. Spin-Out — Spin-Out Premium**

Snap spun out its AR hardware division as Specs Inc. on January 28, 2026 — creating a standalone company focused on AR glasses and spatial computing. The 100-role hiring sprint for Specs Inc. creates extraordinary negotiation leverage. "As an ML/AI Engineer, you are the most sought-after profile in all of tech, and the Specs Inc. spin-out makes you even more valuable. AR glasses literally cannot function without on-device ML — hand tracking, eye tracking, spatial mapping, object recognition, and scene understanding are all ML problems. Without ML engineers, Specs Inc. is shipping empty hardware. And you're not just competing with other AR companies for ML talent — you're competing with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and every AI startup offering $500K+ packages. Candidates should argue for: (1) Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity allocation in addition to Snap RSUs — ML engineers who build the core perception models for AR glasses are building the product itself, not a supporting feature, and their equity should reflect that centrality, (2) a Spin-Out Premium of 20–25% above standard Snap ML comp (which already includes a 15–25% AI Premium) to reflect the dual scarcity of ML expertise and AR/spatial computing domain knowledge, (3) sign-on bonuses of $50K–$80K to offset competing offers from AI labs and big tech companies that are throwing unprecedented packages at ML talent. Frame it as: Specs Inc. needs to compete with Meta Reality Labs, Apple Vision Pro, and Magic Leap for AR talent — the premium is the cost of building a world-class AR team from scratch." Push for $50K–$80K Spin-Out Premium sign-ons.

**Global Levers**

1. **Specs Inc. Spin-Out Premium:** "At Specs Inc., ML isn't a feature — it IS the product. AR glasses without hand tracking, eye tracking, and spatial understanding are just a screen strapped to your face. As an ML engineer building the core perception stack, I need dual equity (Snap RSUs plus substantial Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity) that reflects the fact that my models are the product."
2. **100-Role Hiring Sprint:** "The 100-role sprint is happening during the most competitive ML talent market in history. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Meta FAIR are all offering $400K–$600K+ TC for ML engineers. Specs Inc. needs to match or exceed these packages — and the Specs Inc. equity upside is the lever to do it."
3. **AR/Spatial Computing Race:** "On-device ML for AR glasses is one of the hardest ML challenges in the industry — models must run in real time on power-constrained hardware while maintaining accuracy for safety-critical applications like hand tracking and spatial mapping. ML engineers who can optimize models for edge deployment are the scarcest profile in AR. My experience in [relevant ML area] directly applies."
4. **AI Arms Race Premium:** "Every major tech company is in an AI arms race, and ML/AI engineer comp has increased 30–50% in the past two years. The +15–25% AI Premium is the industry baseline, not a perk. For Specs Inc., where ML is the core product capability, the premium should be at the top of that range or higher."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $228K base and $360K RSUs over 4 years, plus Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity and a $65K Spin-Out Premium sign-on, for this ML/AI Engineer position. The Specs Inc. spin-out means I'd be building the core perception models — hand tracking, eye tracking, spatial mapping — that make AR glasses actually work. ML IS the product at Specs Inc. I have competing offers from OpenAI at $420K TC, Meta FAIR at $380K TC, and Google DeepMind at $370K TC. The Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity is the differentiator, but the liquid comp needs to be within striking distance." Accept at $210K+ base and $320K+ RSUs.
