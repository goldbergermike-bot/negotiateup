| Los Angeles | $160K–$205K | $165K–$270K | 10–15% | $212K–$288K |
| San Francisco | $170K–$218K | $175K–$285K | 10–15% | $225K–$305K |
| New York | $166K–$212K | $170K–$278K | 10–15% | $220K–$298K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Snap protect the privacy and security of 800M+ monthly active users — safeguarding ephemeral messaging, camera data, AR Lens interactions, location data, and the platform's extensive data pipeline against threats ranging from nation-state actors to privacy regulation. The January 2026 Specs Inc. spin-out has created unprecedented security challenges: AR glasses with cameras, microphones, eye tracking, and spatial mapping sensors generate profoundly sensitive data that requires security-by-design from day one. The 100-role hiring sprint means Specs Inc. needs security engineers who can embed privacy and security into the AR platform architecture before the engineering team scales — because retrofitting security into a hardware platform is orders of magnitude harder than building it in from the start.

**Specs Inc. Spin-Out — Spin-Out Premium**

Snap spun out its AR hardware division as Specs Inc. on January 28, 2026 — creating a standalone company focused on AR glasses and spatial computing. The 100-role hiring sprint for Specs Inc. creates extraordinary negotiation leverage. "As a Security Engineer, you are the guardian of the most sensitive data an AR device can collect — real-time camera feeds, eye tracking data, hand tracking telemetry, spatial maps of users' homes and workplaces, and biometric identifiers. A single security breach or privacy scandal could destroy Specs Inc. before it even launches. The regulatory landscape for AR devices (GDPR, CCPA, proposed EU AI Act provisions for biometric data) makes security engineering not just important but existential. Candidates should argue for: (1) Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity allocation in addition to Snap RSUs — security engineers who build the privacy and security architecture for AR glasses from day one prevent existential risk to the company, and their equity should reflect that protective value, (2) a Spin-Out Premium of 15–25% above standard Snap security comp to reflect the novel threat landscape of AR devices and the regulatory complexity of spatial computing, (3) sign-on bonuses of $35K–$55K to match competing offers from companies with lower-risk security mandates. Frame it as: Specs Inc. needs to compete with Meta Reality Labs, Apple Vision Pro, and Magic Leap for AR talent — the premium is the cost of building a world-class AR team from scratch." Push for $35K–$55K Spin-Out Premium sign-ons.

**Global Levers**

1. **Specs Inc. Spin-Out Premium:** "AR glasses collect the most sensitive consumer data in the history of computing — spatial maps, eye tracking, biometrics, always-on camera feeds. A security failure at Specs Inc. isn't just a data breach; it's an existential threat to the company and potentially the entire consumer AR category. My security architecture decisions on day one will determine whether Specs Inc. can even operate in the EU. I need Snap RSUs plus substantial Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity."
2. **100-Role Hiring Sprint:** "Security must be built in from the start — not added after 100 engineers have already built insecure systems. The 100-role sprint creates urgency for security engineers to be among the first hires, establishing security architecture before the engineering team scales. That foundational timing leverage means my comp should reflect day-one impact."
3. **AR/Spatial Computing Race:** "AR security is a specialized domain that combines hardware security (secure enclaves, firmware signing), software security (application sandboxing, data encryption), and privacy engineering (differential privacy, data minimization for spatial data). The number of security engineers who understand all three domains is vanishingly small. My expertise in [relevant area] commands a significant scarcity premium."
4. **Regulatory Risk Mitigation:** "GDPR, CCPA, the EU AI Act, and proposed AR-specific regulations create a minefield for AR hardware companies. Security engineers who understand the intersection of privacy regulation and AR technology prevent multi-billion-dollar regulatory exposure. My security architecture doesn't just protect users — it protects Specs Inc.'s ability to sell AR glasses in major markets."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $198K base and $250K RSUs over 4 years, plus Specs Inc. pre-IPO equity and a $48K Spin-Out Premium sign-on, for this Security Engineer position. The Specs Inc. spin-out means I'd be building the security and privacy architecture for AR glasses that collect spatial maps, eye tracking, and biometric data — the most sensitive consumer data in tech. A security failure here is existential for Specs Inc. I have competing offers from Meta at $290K TC and Apple at $285K TC where the security posture is already established." Accept at $182K+ base and $225K+ RSUs.
