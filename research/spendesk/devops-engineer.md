**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Spendesk are the infrastructure backbone of a platform that processes financial transactions and compliance workflows for 5,000+ companies across Europe. The Agentic Integrity strategy — where autonomous agents handle compliance decisions end-to-end — requires infrastructure that is not just reliable, but auditably reliable. Every deployment, every scaling event, every infrastructure change must satisfy the same compliance bar that the application layer meets. At a $500M+ private company backed by General Atlantic and Index Ventures, the DevOps role is not just about uptime — it is about compliance-grade uptime.

Spendesk's Zero-Human Audit vision places extraordinary demands on infrastructure. The autonomous compliance agents that maintain the 99.8% catch-rate require real-time data processing, low-latency model serving, and zero-downtime deployments — all within EU data residency requirements. A DevOps Engineer at Spendesk is building infrastructure that must simultaneously satisfy engineering velocity, regulatory compliance, and financial-grade reliability. This triple mandate distinguishes the role from standard DevOps positions at SaaS companies.

The Compliance Sovereignty strategy has direct infrastructure implications. Data residency, sovereign cloud deployments, encryption-at-rest and in-transit with EU-controlled keys, and audit-ready logging are not optional features — they are infrastructure requirements. DevOps Engineers who can build and maintain this kind of regulated infrastructure command a premium in the European market. Equity through options (BSPCE for French employees) with 4-year vesting should be negotiated as a significant component of total compensation.

### Zero-Human Audit — The Compliance Sovereignty Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic Integrity Infrastructure:** "The Agentic Integrity platform requires infrastructure that can serve autonomous compliance agents at scale — real-time event processing, ML model inference pipelines, and stateful workflow orchestration. I'll be building the infrastructure that makes Zero-Human Audit operationally possible. This is not standard web application DevOps — it's compliance-grade infrastructure engineering. I'd like a base of €80,000 to reflect this elevated mandate."

**Lever 2 — 99.8% Catch-Rate Infrastructure Reliability:** "The 99.8% catch-rate depends on infrastructure reliability. A single missed event due to a deployment failure, a scaling issue, or a data pipeline outage directly impacts compliance metrics. I'm asking for infrastructure SLA accountability to be reflected in my compensation — €45,000 in options over four years that vest based on the same timeline as the systems I'm building and maintaining."

**Lever 3 — Compliance Sovereignty Cloud Architecture:** "Compliance Sovereignty has direct infrastructure requirements: EU data residency, sovereign encryption key management, jurisdiction-aware data routing, and audit-ready infrastructure logging. Building a cloud architecture that satisfies these requirements while maintaining engineering velocity is a rare skill set. I'd like a €7,000 signing bonus to reflect the specialized cloud architecture expertise I bring to this regulated infrastructure challenge."

**Lever 4 — Financial-Grade CI/CD:** "Deploying to a financial platform that serves 5,000+ companies requires CI/CD pipelines with compliance gates, automated audit trails, and rollback capabilities that standard DevOps doesn't need. Every deployment I manage must be auditable and reversible without data loss. This financial-grade deployment discipline justifies a 12% bonus target tied to infrastructure reliability metrics."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at €82,000 base (Paris) / £86,000 (London) / €84,000 (Berlin), anchoring on the compliance-grade infrastructure premium required for Agentic Integrity. Push for options at €40,000-€50,000 over 4 years, emphasizing that infrastructure reliability directly underlies the 99.8% catch-rate. Request a €7,000-€10,000 signing bonus and a 12% bonus target. Target total comp of €130,000+ / £130,000+ / €130,000+. Accept-at floor: €64,000 base (Paris) with minimum €25,000 in options — below this, the role undervalues the Compliance Sovereignty infrastructure engineering premium that Spendesk's regulated platform demands.
