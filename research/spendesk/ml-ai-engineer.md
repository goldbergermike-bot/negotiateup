**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Spendesk are building the core intelligence that makes the Agentic Integrity platform work. The Zero-Human Audit vision is fundamentally an AI challenge — autonomous agents must classify transactions, detect anomalies, assess compliance risk, and make audit decisions with a 99.8% catch-rate, all without human intervention. At a $500M+ private company backed by General Atlantic and Index Ventures, ML/AI Engineers are the most strategically valuable technical hires. Every model you train, every agent you build, and every inference pipeline you optimize directly determines whether Spendesk's primary competitive differentiator works.

The talent market for ML/AI Engineers in 2026 is the most competitive in tech. Spendesk competes for this talent against FAANG companies, well-funded AI startups, and European fintech peers — all offering significant compensation packages. The advantage Spendesk offers is domain-specific impact: at a large language model lab, you're one of thousands of researchers; at Spendesk, you're building the AI system that 5,000+ companies rely on for financial compliance. The proximity between your models and real-world financial outcomes is immediate and measurable.

Spendesk's Compliance Sovereignty strategy creates a particularly interesting ML/AI challenge. Models must be trained and served within EU data residency constraints, explained to regulators under emerging AI Act requirements, and maintained with audit trails that satisfy financial compliance standards. This is not generic ML engineering — it is regulated AI development for financial services. Equity through options (BSPCE for French employees) with 4-year vesting should be negotiated at the top of band, as ML/AI Engineers create the most durable competitive advantages in Spendesk's portfolio.

### Zero-Human Audit — The Compliance Sovereignty Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic Integrity Core Builder:** "I am the person who builds the autonomous compliance agents at the heart of Spendesk's Agentic Integrity platform. These agents — transaction classifiers, anomaly detectors, risk assessors, and audit decision makers — are the literal implementation of the Zero-Human Audit vision. Without ML/AI Engineers, this vision is a slide deck. I'd like a base of €95,000 to reflect the fact that I'm building the single most strategically important technical system at the company."

**Lever 2 — 99.8% Catch-Rate Model Performance:** "The 99.8% catch-rate is a model performance metric that I will personally be responsible for maintaining and improving. Every tenth of a percentage point matters — at Spendesk's scale, a drop to 99.5% means thousands of missed compliance events across 5,000+ companies. This is high-stakes ML where model performance directly impacts customer trust and regulatory standing. I'm asking for €70,000 in options over four years, which is below what Google or Meta would offer in liquid equity but reflects the private company upside."

**Lever 3 — Compliance Sovereignty AI Governance:** "The EU AI Act and emerging financial AI regulations require explainable, auditable AI systems. Building compliance agents that satisfy these requirements — model explainability, bias monitoring, audit trails for every inference — is a specialized ML engineering discipline. Spendesk's Compliance Sovereignty positioning depends on AI systems that European regulators trust. This regulated AI expertise commands a premium. I'd like a 15% bonus target and my options at the upper end of the band."

**Lever 4 — AI Talent Market Premium:** "ML/AI Engineers with financial services domain expertise and EU regulatory awareness are among the rarest hires in the European tech market. I'm choosing Spendesk over opportunities at companies offering €150,000+ in liquid compensation because I believe in the Agentic Integrity vision. But the equity component must reflect this opportunity cost. I'm asking for a €12,000 signing bonus and options that genuinely compensate for the illiquidity premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at €96,000 base (Paris) / £100,000 (London) / €98,000 (Berlin), anchoring on the fact that ML/AI Engineers are building the core product — the autonomous compliance agents that make Zero-Human Audit real. Push for options at €65,000-€80,000 over 4 years, emphasizing that the compliance agents you build are the single most defensible asset in Spendesk's portfolio. Request a €12,000-€15,000 signing bonus and a 15% bonus target. Target total comp of €180,000+ / £180,000+ / €180,000+. Accept-at floor: €75,000 base (Paris) with minimum €40,000 in options — below this, Spendesk cannot credibly claim to compete for ML/AI talent against the public companies and AI labs that represent your alternative offers.
