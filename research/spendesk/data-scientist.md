**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Spendesk are the analytical engine behind the Agentic Integrity strategy. The company's Zero-Human Audit vision depends on data-driven models that detect anomalies, classify transactions, and automate compliance decisions across 5,000+ companies. At a $500M+ private company backed by General Atlantic and Index Ventures, Data Scientists are not building dashboards — they are building the statistical and machine learning foundations that achieve and maintain the 99.8% catch-rate that defines Spendesk's competitive position in European spend management.

The Compliance Sovereignty positioning creates a uniquely rich data environment. Spendesk processes transaction data across multiple EU jurisdictions, each with different tax codes, regulatory requirements, and compliance patterns. A Data Scientist at Spendesk works with financial data that spans the full spend lifecycle — card transactions, invoice processing, expense claims, and budget adherence — across the all-in-one platform. This breadth of data, combined with the compliance mandate, makes the role significantly more complex than data science at a typical SaaS company.

Spendesk's Paris headquarters provides access to one of Europe's strongest data science talent pools, but competition for experienced practitioners is fierce. Equity through options (BSPCE for French employees) with 4-year vesting should be a core part of the negotiation — Data Scientists who build the models that power Zero-Human Audit are creating durable competitive advantages that compound over time. The role sits at the intersection of financial analytics, compliance automation, and machine learning, commanding a premium over generic data science positions.

### Zero-Human Audit — The Compliance Sovereignty Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic Integrity Model Development:** "Spendesk's Agentic Integrity vision requires Data Scientists who can build the models that power autonomous compliance decisions. I'll be developing the anomaly detection, transaction classification, and risk scoring models that make Zero-Human Audit possible. This is not standard analytics — it's the core intelligence layer of the platform. I'd like a base of €82,000 to reflect the model-development mandate that goes beyond typical data science roles."

**Lever 2 — 99.8% Catch-Rate Model Accountability:** "The 99.8% catch-rate is a model performance metric, and I'll be the person responsible for maintaining and improving it. Every false negative is a compliance risk; every false positive is user friction. Operating at this precision level requires deep statistical expertise and domain knowledge that takes years to develop. I'm looking for €48,000 in options over four years to reflect the long-term value of the models I'll build and refine."

**Lever 3 — Compliance Sovereignty Data Architecture:** "Compliance Sovereignty means Spendesk's data science must operate within EU data residency requirements while still delivering world-class model performance. I'll need to develop approaches that respect data locality constraints, GDPR requirements, and jurisdiction-specific compliance patterns — all while maintaining the catch-rate. This regulatory data science expertise commands a premium over standard DS roles. I'm asking for a 15% annual bonus target."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Jurisdictional Pattern Recognition:** "Spendesk processes spend data across multiple EU countries, each with unique compliance patterns, tax structures, and fraud signatures. Building models that generalize across jurisdictions while remaining sensitive to local regulatory nuances is an extraordinarily challenging data science problem. I'd like a €8,000 signing bonus to offset the domain ramp-up time required to understand Spendesk's multi-jurisdictional data landscape."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at €84,000 base (Paris) / £86,000 (London) / €86,000 (Berlin), anchoring on the Agentic Integrity model development premium. Push for options at €45,000-€55,000 over 4 years, emphasizing that your models directly power the 99.8% catch-rate that defines Spendesk's competitive moat. Request a €8,000-€10,000 signing bonus and a 15% bonus target. Target total comp of €140,000+ / £140,000+ / €140,000+. Accept-at floor: €65,000 base (Paris) with minimum €28,000 in options — below this, the package fails to reflect Data Scientist-level ownership of Zero-Human Audit model performance at a Compliance Sovereignty platform.
