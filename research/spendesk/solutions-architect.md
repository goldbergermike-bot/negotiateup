**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Spendesk bridge the gap between the platform's technical capabilities and enterprise customer requirements. You are the person who translates the Agentic Integrity vision into concrete deployment architectures for prospects and customers — showing CFOs, finance directors, and IT teams at 5,000+ companies how Spendesk's all-in-one spend management platform integrates with their existing ERP, accounting, and banking systems. At a $500M+ private company backed by General Atlantic and Index Ventures, Solutions Architects directly influence deal velocity and deal size by removing technical objections and designing integration solutions.

The Zero-Human Audit positioning changes the nature of the Solutions Architect role fundamentally. You are not just showing how Spendesk handles expenses — you are demonstrating how autonomous compliance agents can eliminate manual audit workflows for enterprise finance teams. Every architecture you design must account for the 99.8% catch-rate, showing customers how the compliance engine integrates with their existing audit and governance frameworks. This is technical selling at the intersection of infrastructure and regulatory compliance.

Spendesk's Compliance Sovereignty strategy is a direct selling point that Solutions Architects deploy in competitive situations against US-based platforms like Brex and Expensify. When European enterprises ask "Where is our data stored?" and "Who controls our compliance logic?", the Solutions Architect provides the technical proof that Spendesk offers true EU sovereignty. Equity through options (BSPCE for French employees) with 4-year vesting, combined with performance-based bonuses tied to deal outcomes, creates a compensation structure where Solutions Architects share directly in the revenue they help generate.

### Zero-Human Audit — The Compliance Sovereignty Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic Integrity Technical Evangelism:** "As a Solutions Architect, I'm the person who makes the Agentic Integrity vision tangible for enterprise customers. I design the integration architecture that shows how Zero-Human Audit works in their specific environment — connecting Spendesk's compliance agents to their ERP, banking APIs, and accounting systems. This is revenue-generating technical work. I'd like a base of €95,000 to reflect the direct revenue impact of technical architecture that closes enterprise deals."

**Lever 2 — 99.8% Catch-Rate Proof Architecture:** "Enterprise customers need to see proof that the 99.8% catch-rate works in their environment. I'll be designing proof-of-concept architectures, running pilot integrations, and building the technical evidence that converts skeptics into customers. This is not generic pre-sales — it's compliance-grade technical proof that directly drives revenue. I'm asking for a variable component of €20,000-€25,000 tied to deal outcomes."

**Lever 3 — Compliance Sovereignty Competitive Positioning:** "In competitive situations against US-based platforms, Compliance Sovereignty is Spendesk's strongest technical differentiator. I'm the person who presents the technical architecture that proves EU data residency, sovereign compliance processing, and regulatory independence. This competitive positioning directly wins deals. I'd like €55,000 in options over four years, reflecting my role in building the technical proof that supports Spendesk's primary competitive moat."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise Integration Complexity:** "Spendesk's all-in-one platform — cards, invoices, expenses, budgets — creates integration complexity that multiplies with every enterprise customer's unique ERP and accounting stack. Solutions Architects who can navigate SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, and Sage integrations while maintaining compliance integrity are rare. I'm asking for a €10,000 signing bonus to reflect the enterprise integration expertise I bring from day one."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at €96,000 base (Paris) / £100,000 (London) / €98,000 (Berlin), anchoring on the revenue-generating nature of technical architecture for Agentic Integrity deals. Push for options at €50,000-€65,000 over 4 years and a variable bonus of €20,000-€25,000 tied to deal outcomes. Request a €10,000 signing bonus citing enterprise integration expertise. Target total comp of €170,000+ / £170,000+ / €170,000+. Accept-at floor: €78,000 base (Paris) with minimum €30,000 in options — below this, the compensation does not reflect the direct revenue impact of a Solutions Architect who translates Zero-Human Audit and Compliance Sovereignty into closed enterprise deals.
