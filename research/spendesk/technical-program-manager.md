**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Spendesk orchestrate the cross-functional execution that brings the Agentic Integrity strategy to market. The Zero-Human Audit vision requires coordinated delivery across engineering, data science, product, and compliance teams — and the TPM is the person who ensures these workstreams converge into shippable, compliance-grade features. At a $500M+ private company backed by General Atlantic and Index Ventures, TPMs manage programs that directly impact whether 5,000+ companies receive the autonomous compliance capabilities Spendesk has promised.

Spendesk's all-in-one platform architecture — spanning cards, invoices, expenses, and budgets — creates program management complexity that scales multiplicatively. A major compliance feature must be validated across all four product surfaces, tested against the 99.8% catch-rate standard, and rolled out with audit-ready documentation. TPMs who can hold this complexity and drive delivery timelines are the connective tissue that prevents Spendesk from fragmenting into siloed product teams that lose the all-in-one coherence.

The Compliance Sovereignty mandate adds a regulatory program management dimension. Every major program must account for multi-jurisdictional compliance requirements, EU data residency constraints, and regulatory review cycles that don't follow agile sprint cadences. TPMs who can navigate both engineering velocity and regulatory timelines — managing stakeholders in Paris, London, Berlin, and regulatory bodies — bring a rare combination of technical fluency and institutional awareness. Equity through options (BSPCE for French employees) with 4-year vesting reflects the long-term program execution value that TPMs provide.

### Zero-Human Audit — The Compliance Sovereignty Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic Integrity Program Orchestration:** "Delivering the Agentic Integrity platform requires cross-functional program management across engineering, data science, product, and compliance. I'll be orchestrating the programs that bring Zero-Human Audit from roadmap to production — coordinating workstreams that span autonomous agent development, compliance rule engines, and platform integration. This is not standard feature delivery; it's regulated product program management. I'd like a base of €92,000."

**Lever 2 — 99.8% Catch-Rate Release Management:** "Every release that touches the compliance pipeline must be validated against the 99.8% catch-rate standard before shipping. I'll manage the release programs that ensure this quality bar is met — coordinating testing, validation, and rollout across multiple product surfaces. This compliance-grade release management adds significant program complexity and risk management responsibility. I'm asking for €52,000 in options over four years."

**Lever 3 — Compliance Sovereignty Regulatory Coordination:** "Compliance Sovereignty programs require coordination with EU regulatory frameworks, data protection authorities, and jurisdiction-specific compliance requirements. This is a program management dimension that doesn't exist at non-financial-services companies. I'll be managing programs that must satisfy both engineering delivery timelines and regulatory review cycles. I'd like a 15% bonus target tied to program delivery milestones."

**Lever 4 — Multi-Office Program Delivery:** "Spendesk's distributed engineering organization across Paris, London, and Berlin means major programs span multiple offices, time zones, and labor market contexts. Managing program delivery across this distributed organization while maintaining the all-in-one platform coherence requires sophisticated program management. I'm asking for a €8,000 signing bonus to reflect the immediate cross-organizational impact I'll have."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at €94,000 base (Paris) / £96,000 (London) / €96,000 (Berlin), anchoring on the Agentic Integrity program orchestration premium. Push for options at €48,000-€60,000 over 4 years, emphasizing that program execution directly determines the pace of Compliance Sovereignty delivery. Request a 15% bonus target and an €8,000-€10,000 signing bonus. Target total comp of €160,000+ / £155,000+ / €160,000+. Accept-at floor: €75,000 base (Paris) with minimum €30,000 in options — below this, the role undervalues TPM-level ownership of Zero-Human Audit cross-functional program delivery.
