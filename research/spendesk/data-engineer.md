**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Spendesk build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers the entire Agentic Integrity platform. The Zero-Human Audit vision depends on data pipelines that can ingest, transform, and deliver financial transaction data in real-time to autonomous compliance agents. At a $500M+ private company backed by General Atlantic and Index Ventures, Data Engineers are building the plumbing that connects 5,000+ companies' spend data to the compliance engine that achieves the 99.8% catch-rate. Without reliable, auditable, low-latency data pipelines, the autonomous compliance agents have nothing to work with.

Spendesk's all-in-one platform processes diverse financial data streams — card transactions, invoice processing, expense claims, and budget tracking — each with different data formats, latency requirements, and compliance constraints. Data Engineers must build pipelines that unify these streams while maintaining data lineage and audit trails that satisfy EU regulators. This is not standard ETL work — it is compliance-grade data engineering where every record must be traceable, every transformation must be reversible, and every pipeline must be monitored for data quality degradation.

The Compliance Sovereignty strategy has direct implications for data engineering. EU data residency requirements, GDPR data processing constraints, and jurisdiction-aware data routing mean Data Engineers must build architectures that keep European financial data within sovereign boundaries. This adds architectural complexity that standard data engineering roles at US-based companies don't face. Equity through options (BSPCE for French employees) with 4-year vesting reflects the foundational nature of the data infrastructure — the pipelines built today will serve Spendesk's compliance engine for years to come.

### Zero-Human Audit — The Compliance Sovereignty Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic Integrity Data Pipeline Architecture:** "The Agentic Integrity platform requires real-time data pipelines that feed autonomous compliance agents with structured, validated financial data. I'll be building the data infrastructure that makes Zero-Human Audit operationally possible — ingesting transaction streams, applying compliance transformations, and delivering audit-ready data to ML models. This is not standard batch ETL; it's real-time, compliance-grade data engineering. I'd like a base of €80,000."

**Lever 2 — 99.8% Catch-Rate Data Quality:** "The 99.8% catch-rate starts with data quality. If the data pipelines deliver incomplete, malformed, or delayed data to the compliance engine, the catch-rate degrades immediately. I'll be building data quality monitoring, validation gates, and pipeline reliability that directly underpin Spendesk's core competitive metric. I'm asking for €45,000 in options over four years to reflect the foundational nature of this data quality work."

**Lever 3 — Compliance Sovereignty Data Residency:** "Compliance Sovereignty requires data engineering that respects EU data residency requirements at the pipeline level — not as an afterthought, but as a core architectural constraint. I'll be building jurisdiction-aware data routing, sovereign data lakes, and audit-ready data lineage that satisfies GDPR, DORA, and EU financial regulators. This data sovereignty engineering expertise commands a premium. I'd like a 12% bonus target."

**Lever 4 — All-in-One Data Unification:** "Spendesk's all-in-one platform generates data from four distinct product surfaces — cards, invoices, expenses, and budgets — each with different schemas, latency profiles, and compliance requirements. Building unified data pipelines that serve the compliance engine across all four surfaces requires data engineering sophistication beyond what point-solution competitors demand. I'm asking for a €7,000 signing bonus to reflect this platform-scale data engineering expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at €82,000 base (Paris) / £84,000 (London) / €83,000 (Berlin), anchoring on the real-time compliance-grade data pipeline premium. Push for options at €40,000-€50,000 over 4 years, emphasizing that data quality directly determines the 99.8% catch-rate. Request a €7,000-€9,000 signing bonus and a 12% bonus target. Target total comp of €130,000+ / £130,000+ / €130,000+. Accept-at floor: €62,000 base (Paris) with minimum €24,000 in options — below this, the role undervalues the data engineering foundation of Zero-Human Audit and Compliance Sovereignty.
