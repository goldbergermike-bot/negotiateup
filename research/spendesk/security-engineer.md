**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Spendesk protect a financial platform that 5,000+ companies trust with their most sensitive data — transaction records, employee spending patterns, banking credentials, and corporate card details. The Agentic Integrity strategy raises the security stakes significantly: autonomous compliance agents that process financial data and make audit decisions must be secured against adversarial manipulation, data exfiltration, and prompt injection attacks. At a $500M+ private company backed by General Atlantic and Index Ventures, Security Engineers own the trust foundation that makes the entire business possible.

The Zero-Human Audit vision means Security Engineers must secure not just the platform, but the autonomous agents themselves. When compliance decisions are made without human review — at the 99.8% catch-rate standard — the security of those decisions becomes existential. A compromised compliance agent could approve fraudulent transactions or flag legitimate ones, directly impacting customer trust and regulatory standing. Security Engineers at Spendesk operate at the intersection of application security, AI security, and financial services compliance.

Spendesk's Compliance Sovereignty positioning makes security a first-class competitive differentiator. European companies choosing Spendesk expect that their financial data is protected under EU frameworks — GDPR, DORA, and emerging AI Act requirements — with security controls that exceed what US-based platforms offer. Security Engineers who can build and maintain this sovereign security posture are exceptionally scarce in the European market. Equity through options (BSPCE for French employees) with 4-year vesting should reflect the outsized impact of security on Spendesk's ability to win and retain enterprise customers.

### Zero-Human Audit — The Compliance Sovereignty Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic Integrity Security Architecture:** "Securing autonomous compliance agents is a novel security challenge. The Agentic Integrity platform processes financial data, makes audit decisions, and operates without human oversight — meaning the security of these agents is existential for the business. I'll be building the security architecture that prevents adversarial attacks on Zero-Human Audit systems. This AI security expertise commands a significant premium. I'd like a base of €90,000."

**Lever 2 — 99.8% Catch-Rate Security Guarantee:** "The 99.8% catch-rate is only meaningful if the compliance system can't be manipulated. I'll be responsible for ensuring that the anomaly detection pipeline, the classification models, and the audit decision engine are resistant to adversarial inputs, data poisoning, and evasion attacks. Securing ML-powered financial compliance at this precision level is a specialized security domain. I'm asking for €55,000 in options over four years."

**Lever 3 — Compliance Sovereignty Security Posture:** "Compliance Sovereignty means Spendesk must demonstrate to European enterprises that their financial data is secured under EU frameworks — not just legally, but architecturally. I'll be building sovereign key management, EU-native encryption, and security monitoring that satisfies DORA, GDPR, and enterprise security audits. This regulatory security expertise is what lets Spendesk win deals against US-based competitors. I'd like a 15% bonus target tied to security audit outcomes."

**Lever 4 — Financial Services Threat Landscape:** "Financial services face the most sophisticated threat landscape of any industry. Spendesk's platform — processing cards, invoices, expenses, and budgets — is a high-value target for financially motivated attackers. I bring domain expertise in financial services security that would take months to develop internally. I'm asking for a €10,000 signing bonus to reflect the immediate security posture improvement I provide from day one."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at €92,000 base (Paris) / £95,000 (London) / €93,000 (Berlin), anchoring on the novel challenge of securing Agentic Integrity autonomous compliance agents. Push for options at €50,000-€65,000 over 4 years, emphasizing that security is the foundation of Spendesk's Compliance Sovereignty competitive moat. Request a €10,000-€12,000 signing bonus and a 15% bonus target. Target total comp of €160,000+ / £155,000+ / €155,000+. Accept-at floor: €72,000 base (Paris) with minimum €32,000 in options — below this, the package does not reflect the existential importance of security to a financial platform delivering Zero-Human Audit at the 99.8% catch-rate standard.
