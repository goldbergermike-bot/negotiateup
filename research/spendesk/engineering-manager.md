**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Spendesk sit at the intersection of technical execution and organizational strategy. You are responsible for building and leading the teams that deliver the Agentic Integrity platform — the autonomous compliance engine that powers Spendesk's Zero-Human Audit vision. At a $500M+ private company backed by General Atlantic and Index Ventures, EMs own the output of engineering teams whose work directly impacts the 99.8% catch-rate and serves 5,000+ companies across Europe. This is not a coordination role — it is a leadership role where your team's velocity determines whether Spendesk achieves Compliance Sovereignty before competitors can replicate the strategy.

Spendesk's Paris-headquartered, multi-office structure (Paris, London, Berlin) means Engineering Managers often lead distributed teams across time zones and regulatory jurisdictions. The all-in-one spend management platform — cards, invoices, expenses, budgets — creates natural team boundaries, but the Compliance Sovereignty mandate cuts across all of them. An effective EM at Spendesk must understand both the product surface they own and how it connects to the broader compliance architecture. This cross-cutting responsibility justifies compensation above typical mid-stage startup EM bands.

The equity component is critical at the EM level. Options (BSPCE for French employees) with 4-year vesting represent the primary mechanism for aligning your incentives with Spendesk's long-term trajectory. EMs who build high-performing teams that ship compliance-grade infrastructure are directly accelerating the path to a liquidity event. Negotiate equity aggressively — at the EM level, your impact multiplies through every engineer on your team, and your options grant should reflect that multiplicative effect.

### Zero-Human Audit — The Compliance Sovereignty Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic Integrity Team Leadership:** "I'll be building and leading the team that delivers the Agentic Integrity platform. The Zero-Human Audit vision isn't just a technical challenge — it's an organizational one. I need to hire the right engineers, create the right team structures, and drive execution against a compliance bar that has zero margin for error. This leadership responsibility justifies a base of €105,000, which is competitive with EM roles at Qonto and Payfit but below what Google or Meta would offer for equivalent scope."

**Lever 2 — 99.8% Catch-Rate Team Accountability:** "My team will own the systems that maintain Spendesk's 99.8% catch-rate. That means I'm personally accountable for hiring, mentoring, and retaining engineers who can operate at that quality bar — and for creating processes that prevent regressions. This accountability premium should be reflected in my equity. I'm looking for €90,000 in options over four years, which values my team's output as a direct driver of Spendesk's core competitive metric."

**Lever 3 — Compliance Sovereignty Hiring Mandate:** "Building Compliance Sovereignty requires engineers with a rare combination of systems design and regulatory understanding. As an Engineering Manager, I'm the person who finds, attracts, and retains this talent in a competitive European market. My ability to hire effectively directly determines the speed of Spendesk's Compliance Sovereignty roadmap. I'd like a signing bonus of €12,000 to cover the transition cost and signal that Spendesk is serious about competing for management talent."

**Lever 4 — Distributed Team Premium:** "Leading engineering teams across Paris, London, and Berlin — each with different labor markets, regulatory contexts, and cultural norms — requires management sophistication beyond a single-office EM role. This distributed leadership is what makes the EU compliance leadership vision executable across jurisdictions. I'm asking for a €15,000 annual bonus target tied to team performance metrics, reflecting the complexity of my management scope."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at €108,000 base (Paris) / £112,000 (London) / €110,000 (Berlin), positioning yourself as the leader who builds the Agentic Integrity team. Push for options at €85,000-€100,000 over 4 years, emphasizing that your team's output is the multiplicative engine of Spendesk's compliance strategy. Request a €12,000-€15,000 signing bonus and a performance bonus structure of 15-20% of base. Target total comp of €215,000+ / £210,000+ / €215,000+. Accept-at floor: €88,000 base (Paris) with minimum €55,000 in options — below this, the role does not reflect EM-level accountability for Zero-Human Audit outcomes.
