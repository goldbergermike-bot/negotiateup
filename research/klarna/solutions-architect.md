**Negotiation DNA**

Klarna Solutions Architects are the technical sales strategists who onboard merchants to the Agentic Product Protocol — designing integration architectures, running technical evaluations, and proving that Klarna's protocol delivers better AI shopping conversion than direct merchant implementations. You are the face of protocol adoption for merchants — every integration you design grows the network effect. [Source: Klarna SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Agentic Product Protocol — The Common Language Architect**

As a Solutions Architect, you drive merchant adoption of the common language — the technical sales execution that grows the 500,000+ merchant network. "As a Solutions Architect onboarding merchants to the Agentic Product Protocol, I drive the network effect that makes the protocol the standard. I want equity reflecting my direct impact on merchant adoption."

**Global Levers**

1. **Merchant Adoption Impact:** "I onboard merchants to the Agentic Product Protocol — every integration I design grows the network effect. $215K+ RSUs reflecting my direct impact on protocol adoption velocity."
2. **Integration Architecture Design:** "I design the technical integration architectures that make protocol adoption fast and reliable for merchants — the SA execution that converts legacy commerce into AI-native protocol integration."
3. **Network Effect Growth:** "Each merchant I onboard strengthens the protocol's network effect — more merchants means more products for AI agents means more transactions means more merchants. My integration work creates a flywheel."
4. **Stripe/Adyen SA Parity:** "Stripe and Adyen SAs earn $295K+ TC. Klarna SAs driving protocol adoption across 500,000+ merchants deserve competitive SA comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $222K base and $215K RSUs over 4 years for this Solutions Architect role driving Agentic Product Protocol merchant adoption. Every integration I design grows the network effect — converting merchants to the common language for AI shopping. I have competing offers from [Stripe SA at $368K TC / Adyen SA at $332K TC / Block SA at $315K TC]. Solutions architects driving protocol adoption at scale are the network-effect engines for AI commerce." Accept at $205K+ base and $192K+ RSUs.
