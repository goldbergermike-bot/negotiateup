**Negotiation DNA**

Klarna Solutions Architects are the technical sales strategists who onboard merchants to the Agentic Product Protocol — designing integration architectures, running technical evaluations, and proving that Klarna's protocol delivers better AI shopping conversion than direct merchant implementations. You are the face of protocol adoption for merchants — every integration you design grows the network effect. [Source: Klarna SA Comp 2025-2026]
