**Negotiation DNA**

Klarna Engineering Managers lead the teams building the Agentic Product Protocol — hiring the protocol engineers, driving the execution velocity that determines whether Klarna's protocol reaches market before competing standards, and coordinating cross-team delivery across the protocol specification, merchant integration, and AI agent interface layers. Your team's velocity determines whether Klarna defines the common language for AI shopping. [Source: Klarna EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Agentic Product Protocol — The Common Language Architect**

As an Engineering Manager, you lead the teams whose execution velocity determines whether the Agentic Product Protocol becomes the industry standard. "As an Engineering Manager leading protocol teams, my execution velocity determines whether Klarna's protocol becomes the standard for AI shopping. I want $338K+ RSUs — my team's delivery speed is the difference between defining the standard and chasing a competitor's."

**Global Levers**

1. **Protocol Team Velocity:** "I lead the teams building the Agentic Product Protocol. $338K+ RSUs — my execution velocity determines whether Klarna's protocol reaches market as the standard for AI agent commerce."
2. **Standard-Setting Execution:** "I coordinate delivery across protocol specification, merchant integration, and AI agent interface teams — the cross-team execution that turns a protocol design into an adopted industry standard."
3. **Protocol Talent Retention:** "I hire and retain the protocol engineers building the common language for AI shopping. Engineering managers who attract commerce-protocol talent during this standard-setting race command premium comp."
4. **Stripe/Adyen EM Parity:** "Stripe and Adyen EMs earn $408K+ TC. Klarna EMs leading protocol teams building the AI commerce standard deserve competitive management comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $275K base and $338K RSUs over 4 years for this Engineering Manager role leading Agentic Product Protocol teams. My execution velocity determines whether Klarna's protocol becomes the industry standard for AI shopping. I have competing offers from [Stripe EM at $508K TC / Adyen EM at $462K TC / Block EM at $435K TC]. Engineering managers leading standard-setting protocol teams are the execution bottleneck for AI commerce." Accept at $255K+ base and $305K+ RSUs.
