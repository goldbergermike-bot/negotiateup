**Negotiation DNA**

Klarna Security Engineers protect the Agentic Product Protocol — securing the AI agent authentication layer, preventing payment fraud in autonomous transactions, and ensuring the protocol meets PCI-DSS and financial regulatory requirements. AI agent security is a new discipline: when AI agents transact autonomously, traditional authentication fails and new trust models are required. [Source: Klarna Security Comp 2025-2026]

I want equity reflecting my role — without protocol security, AI shopping doesn't work."
