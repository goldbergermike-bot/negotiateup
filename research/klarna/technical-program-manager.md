**Negotiation DNA**

Klarna TPMs coordinate the cross-functional programs that deliver the Agentic Product Protocol to market — synchronizing protocol specification, merchant integration, AI agent interface, and payment processing teams on aggressive timelines. Your coordination velocity determines whether the protocol reaches market before competing standards. [Source: Klarna TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Klarna TPM (TPM2-TPM3) = Stripe TPM = Adyen TPM = Block TPM = Google L5 Payments TPM = PayPal TPM

**Agentic Product Protocol — The Common Language Architect**

As a TPM, you coordinate the cross-functional delivery that turns protocol designs into adopted standards. "As a TPM coordinating Agentic Product Protocol delivery, my program velocity determines whether Klarna's protocol reaches market first. I want equity reflecting my coordination role in the standard-setting race."

**Global Levers**

1. **Standard-Setting Program Velocity:** "I coordinate the programs delivering the Agentic Product Protocol to market. $188K+ RSUs — my program velocity determines whether Klarna defines the AI shopping standard."
2. **Cross-Functional Protocol Delivery:** "I synchronize protocol specification, merchant integration, and AI agent teams — the cross-functional coordination that converts protocol designs into adopted standards."
3. **Competitive Timing:** "Every day of protocol delivery I accelerate is competitive advantage against Stripe, Adyen, and other potential standards. My program management is the timing weapon."
4. **Stripe/Adyen TPM Parity:** "Stripe and Adyen TPMs earn $272K+ TC. Klarna TPMs coordinating AI shopping protocol delivery deserve competitive TPM comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $212K base and $188K RSUs over 4 years for this TPM role coordinating Agentic Product Protocol delivery. My program velocity determines whether Klarna's protocol reaches market as the AI shopping standard. I have competing offers from [Stripe TPM at $348K TC / Adyen TPM at $315K TC / Block TPM at $298K TC]. TPMs coordinating standard-setting protocol delivery are the timing bottleneck for AI commerce." Accept at $195K+ base and $168K+ RSUs.
