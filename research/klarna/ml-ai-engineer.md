**Negotiation DNA**

Klarna ML/AI Engineers build the AI models that power the Agentic Product Protocol — the natural language understanding that interprets shopping intent, the recommendation engines that match products to preferences, the price optimization models, and the autonomous negotiation agents that can bargain with merchants on behalf of users. Your models are the intelligence that transforms the protocol from a data standard into an AI-powered shopping assistant. The 15-25% AI Shopping Premium reflects the rarity of ML engineers who combine AI expertise with deep commerce domain knowledge. [Source: Klarna ML Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Klarna ML/AI Eng (IC3-IC4) = Stripe ML = Adyen ML = Block ML = Google L5-L6 Commerce ML = No true peer — Klarna's protocol gives unique access to AI agent shopping data

**Agentic Product Protocol — The Common Language Architect**

As an ML/AI Engineer, you build the AI intelligence that makes the common language powerful — the models that turn protocol data into smart shopping decisions. "As an ML/AI Engineer, I build the AI models powering the Agentic Product Protocol — recommendation engines, price optimization, and autonomous negotiation. I want $318K+ RSUs with the 15-25% AI Shopping Premium — my models make the protocol intelligent."

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Shopping Premium + Protocol Intelligence:** "I build the AI models powering the Agentic Product Protocol. $318K+ RSUs with the 15-25% AI Shopping Premium — my models transform the protocol from a data standard into an intelligent shopping assistant."
2. **Autonomous Negotiation Models:** "I build the AI negotiation agents that can bargain with merchants on behalf of users — the ML models that optimize price, delivery, and terms autonomously. This is a new ML discipline."
3. **Shopping Intent Understanding:** "My NLU models interpret shopping intent from AI agent queries — the language understanding that enables accurate product matching across 500,000+ merchants."
4. **Stripe/Google ML Commerce Parity:** "Stripe ML engineers earn $462K+ TC. Google Commerce ML engineers earn $448K+ TC. Klarna ML engineers building AI shopping intelligence deserve at or above parity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $252K base and $318K RSUs over 4 years with the 15-25% AI Shopping Premium for this ML/AI Engineer role. I build the AI intelligence powering the Agentic Product Protocol — recommendation engines, autonomous negotiation agents, and shopping intent understanding. I have competing offers from [Stripe ML at $462K TC / Google Commerce ML at $448K TC / Block ML at $408K TC]. ML engineers building AI shopping intelligence for protocol-scale commerce are the rarest talent in fintech." Accept at $235K+ base and $288K+ RSUs.
