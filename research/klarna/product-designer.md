**Agentic Product Protocol — The Common Language Architect**

As a Product Designer, you design how the common language looks and feels — the experience layer that makes AI shopping intuitive for users and merchants. "As a Product Designer, I design the experience layer of the Agentic Product Protocol — how AI agents present products and how merchants integrate. I want equity reflecting my role making AI shopping trustworthy and effortless."

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Shopping Experience Design:** "I design how AI agents present products to users through the protocol — the trust and clarity that converts AI recommendations into purchases. My UX determines whether users trust AI shopping."
2. **Protocol Developer Experience:** "I design the merchant and developer integration experience — the UX that makes protocol adoption intuitive and drives the 500,000+ merchant network effect."
3. **Agentic Interaction Patterns:** "I design new human-AI shopping interaction patterns — how users oversee, approve, and guide AI agents that shop on their behalf. This new design discipline has no established patterns."
4. **Stripe/Adyen Design Parity:** "Stripe and Adyen designers earn $232K+ TC. Klarna designers creating the AI shopping experience deserve competitive design comp."

I design how AI agents present products and how merchants integrate — my UX determines whether users trust AI shopping. I have competing offers from [Stripe Design at $282K TC / Adyen Design at $245K TC / Block Design at $238K TC]. Designers creating AI shopping experiences are rare UX talent."
