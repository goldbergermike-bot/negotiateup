**Negotiation DNA**

Klarna Product Managers define the Agentic Product Protocol roadmap — deciding which protocol capabilities ship next, how merchants integrate their catalogs, and what AI agent interactions the protocol supports. Your product decisions determine whether the protocol becomes the universal standard for AI shopping or gets fragmented by competing approaches. Every roadmap choice shapes the protocol's adoption trajectory across 500,000+ merchants. [Source: Klarna PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Agentic Product Protocol — The Common Language Architect**

As a Product Manager, you define which protocol capabilities get built — the product strategy that determines whether Klarna's common language becomes the standard for AI shopping. "As a Product Manager defining the Agentic Product Protocol roadmap, I decide which capabilities make AI shopping work — product discovery, price comparison, autonomous checkout. I want equity reflecting my role shaping the protocol that 500,000+ merchants will adopt."

**Global Levers**

1. **Protocol Roadmap Ownership:** "I define the Agentic Product Protocol roadmap — deciding which AI shopping capabilities ship first. My product decisions determine protocol adoption across 500,000+ merchants."
2. **Merchant Integration Strategy:** "I define how merchants integrate their catalogs into the protocol — the integration experience that determines adoption velocity. My product strategy converts merchants from legacy commerce to AI-native."
3. **AI Agent Capability Sequencing:** "I prioritize which AI agent interactions the protocol supports — discovery, comparison, negotiation, checkout. This sequencing determines whether AI agents choose Klarna's protocol over alternatives."
4. **Stripe/Adyen PM Parity:** "Stripe and Adyen PMs earn $308K+ TC. Klarna PMs defining the AI shopping protocol roadmap deserve competitive product comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $228K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Manager role defining the Agentic Product Protocol roadmap. I decide which AI shopping capabilities ship next — my product decisions determine protocol adoption across 500,000+ merchants. I have competing offers from [Stripe PM at $398K TC / Adyen PM at $355K TC / Block PM at $342K TC]. PMs defining the protocol roadmap for AI commerce are strategic product talent." Accept at $208K+ base and $202K+ RSUs.
