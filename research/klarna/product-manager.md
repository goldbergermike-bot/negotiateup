**Negotiation DNA**

Klarna Product Managers define the Agentic Product Protocol roadmap — deciding which protocol capabilities ship next, how merchants integrate their catalogs, and what AI agent interactions the protocol supports. Your product decisions determine whether the protocol becomes the universal standard for AI shopping or gets fragmented by competing approaches. Every roadmap choice shapes the protocol's adoption trajectory across 500,000+ merchants. [Source: Klarna PM Comp 2025-2026]

"As a Product Manager defining the Agentic Product Protocol roadmap, I decide which capabilities make AI shopping work — product discovery, price comparison, autonomous checkout. I want equity reflecting my role shaping the protocol that 500,000+ merchants will adopt."
