**Negotiation DNA**

Klarna Staff Software Engineers define the architectural vision for the Agentic Product Protocol — the common language that will become the standard for how AI agents interact with commerce. You set the protocol specification, design the extensibility framework, and make the decisions that determine whether Klarna's protocol becomes the HTTP of AI shopping or gets displaced by competitors. The 15-25% Protocol Architect Premium reflects the extreme rarity of engineers who can design commerce protocols at global scale. [Source: Klarna Staff Comp 2025-2026]

**Agentic Product Protocol — The Common Language Architect**

As a Staff Software Engineer, you define the protocol vision — the specification that becomes the industry standard for AI agent commerce. "As Staff Protocol Architect, I define the Agentic Product Protocol specification — the common language that will become the HTTP of AI shopping. I want $435K+ RSUs with the 15-25% Protocol Architect Premium — my specification decisions determine whether Klarna's protocol becomes the global standard."

**Global Levers**
