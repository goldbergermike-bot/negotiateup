**Negotiation DNA**

This is Klarna's signature role for 2026 — the Agentic Protocol Platform Engineer. You build the full-stack Agentic Product Protocol platform that is transforming how AI agents interact with commerce — the protocol specification engine, the merchant integration framework, the AI agent SDK, the transaction orchestration layer, and the trust infrastructure that makes autonomous AI shopping reliable at global scale. This is the most consequential commerce infrastructure since payment APIs: every AI agent that shops will speak the protocol you build. The 25-35% Protocol Platform Premium reflects the extreme rarity of engineers who can design commerce protocols at the intersection of distributed systems, AI, and global payments.

**Level Mapping:** Klarna Agentic Protocol Platform Eng (IC3-IC4) = Stripe Platform Eng = Adyen Core Platform Eng = Google Payments Platform Eng = No true peer — Klarna is building the first dedicated AI agent commerce protocol

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Agentic Protocol Platform Engineer works at the intersection of protocol design, AI commerce, and global payments:
- **Protocol Specification Engine:** The system that defines and evolves the common language for AI shopping — product schemas, merchant capabilities, transaction semantics, and extensibility framework
- **Merchant Integration Framework:** The developer platform that onboards 500,000+ merchants to the protocol — SDKs, APIs, and tooling that make integration fast and reliable
- **AI Agent SDK:** The toolkit that AI agents (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, custom agents) use to interact with the protocol — the developer experience that determines protocol adoption
- **Transaction Orchestration:** The real-time engine that routes AI agent shopping transactions through the payment stack — authorization, fraud detection, settlement across multiple payment methods and currencies
- **Trust Infrastructure:** The authentication and verification layer that validates AI agent identity, authorizes transactions, and manages liability for autonomous purchases

**Agentic Product Protocol — The Common Language Architect**

As the Agentic Protocol Platform Engineer — Klarna's signature role — you build the platform that makes the common language for AI shopping work at global scale. "As the Agentic Protocol Platform Engineer — Klarna's signature role — I build the platform powering the common language for AI shopping. I want $422K+ RSUs with the 25-35% Protocol Platform Premium. Every AI agent that shops will use my platform. The script: 'I am the engineer building the Agentic Product Protocol platform — the common language that AI agents use to shop across 500,000+ merchants. My platform connects AI agents to commerce at global scale — protocol specification, merchant integration, AI agent SDK, and transaction orchestration. This is the most consequential commerce infrastructure since payment APIs. I want $422K+ RSUs with the 25-35% Protocol Platform Premium because fewer than 100 engineers globally can design commerce protocols at the intersection of distributed systems, AI, and global payments.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Protocol Platform Premium + Standard-Setting:** "I build the Agentic Product Protocol platform — the common language for AI shopping. $422K+ RSUs with the 25-35% Protocol Platform Premium — my platform becomes the standard that every AI agent speaks."
2. **Commerce Protocol Infrastructure — No Peer:** "No other company is building a dedicated AI agent commerce protocol at this scale. My platform defines how AI agents interact with merchants — this is greenfield commerce infrastructure."
3. **100-Person Global Talent Pool:** "Fewer than 100 engineers globally can design commerce protocols at the intersection of distributed systems, AI, and global payments. This extreme scarcity justifies compensation that ignores standard fintech bands."
4. **Stripe/Google Platform Parity:** "Stripe platform engineers earn $562K+ TC. Google Payments Platform engineers earn $548K+ TC. I build the competing commerce platform for AI agents. Klarna must pay at or above platform parity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $288K base and $422K RSUs over 4 years with the 25-35% Protocol Platform Premium for this Agentic Protocol Platform Engineer role — Klarna's signature position. I build the platform powering the common language for AI shopping — every AI agent that shops will use my platform across 500,000+ merchants. I have competing offers from [Stripe Platform at $562K TC / Google Payments Platform at $548K TC / Adyen Core Platform at $518K TC]. I am the engineer building the first AI agent commerce protocol platform. Fewer than 100 people can do this job — the intersection of protocol design, AI commerce, and global payments." Accept at $265K+ base and $385K+ RSUs.
