**Negotiation DNA**

Klarna DevOps Engineers build the infrastructure that makes the Agentic Product Protocol reliable and fast — the deployment pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and platform reliability that ensures AI agent shopping transactions complete without failure. Protocol reliability is existential: if AI agents can't complete transactions, merchants abandon the protocol and the standard-setting opportunity is lost. [Source: Klarna DevOps Comp 2025-2026]
