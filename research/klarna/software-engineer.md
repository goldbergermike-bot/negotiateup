**Negotiation DNA**

Klarna Software Engineers build the Agentic Product Protocol — the common language that enables AI shopping agents to discover, compare, negotiate, and purchase products autonomously across Klarna's 500,000+ merchant network. Launched December 2025, this protocol transforms Klarna from a buy-now-pay-later company into the infrastructure layer for AI-powered commerce. Your code defines how AI agents understand products, verify merchants, and execute transactions — the protocol that every AI shopping assistant in the world will speak.

**Agentic Product Protocol — The Common Language Architect**

As a Software Engineer building the Agentic Product Protocol, you create the common language that AI agents use to shop. Every AI assistant — from ChatGPT to Gemini to custom enterprise agents — will use your protocol to interact with merchants. "As a Software Engineer building the Agentic Product Protocol, I'm creating the common language for AI shopping. Every AI agent that shops will speak the protocol I build. I want equity reflecting my role as a Common Language Architect — the engineer defining how AI commerce works across 500,000+ merchants."

**Global Levers**

1. **Common Language Architect Equity:** "I build the Agentic Product Protocol — the common language for AI shopping. This protocol will become the standard for every AI agent that transacts. I want equity reflecting my role defining how AI commerce works."
2. **500,000+ Merchant Network Effect:** "My protocol connects AI agents to 500,000+ merchants — the network effect that makes Klarna's protocol the default standard for agentic commerce. Each merchant integration I build strengthens the moat."
3. **Stripe/Adyen Competition:** "Stripe and Adyen SWEs earn $278K+ TC. Klarna must offer competitive comp to attract engineers building the protocol that defines AI shopping — the most transformative commerce infrastructure since credit cards."
4. **Protocol Standard-Setting:** "I'm building the protocol that will become the industry standard for AI agent commerce. Standard-setting engineers — like those who built HTTP, OAuth, or Stripe's API — command premium comp because their work becomes the infrastructure everyone depends on."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $205K base and $202K RSUs over 4 years for this Software Engineer role building the Agentic Product Protocol. I create the common language that AI agents use to shop across 500,000+ merchants — the protocol that will become the standard for agentic commerce. I have competing offers from [Stripe SWE at $342K TC / Adyen SWE at $312K TC / Block SWE at $298K TC]. Common Language Architects building the protocol for AI shopping are the most consequential commerce engineers since Stripe defined online payments." Accept at $192K+ base and $178K+ RSUs.
