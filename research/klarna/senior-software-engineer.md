### Senior Software Engineer | Klarna Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Agentic Product Protocol | Common Language Architect | AI Shopping Platform | **AGENTIC COMMERCE PIONEER**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Stockholm | SEK 72K–95K/mo / $198K–$252K | SEK 55K–95K/mo / $152K–$268K | 15–20% | SEK 95K–142K/mo / $248K–$348K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Klarna Senior Software Engineers own the critical subsystems of the Agentic Product Protocol — designing the product schema language, merchant verification APIs, AI agent authentication layer, and the transaction orchestration engine that enables autonomous AI shopping at scale. Your architectural decisions determine how AI agents understand and interact with products — the protocol semantics that every AI shopping assistant will depend on.

**Agentic Product Protocol — The Common Language Architect**

As a Senior Software Engineer, you architect the protocol subsystems that make AI shopping semantically rich and commercially reliable. "As a Senior Software Engineer architecting the Agentic Product Protocol, I design the subsystems that make AI shopping work — product schemas, merchant verification, and transaction orchestration. I want $292K+ RSUs reflecting my role as a senior Common Language Architect defining protocol semantics for 500,000+ merchants."

**Global Levers**

1. **Senior Common Language Architect Equity:** "I architect the Agentic Product Protocol subsystems — the semantic layer that AI agents use to understand products and merchants. $292K+ RSUs — my protocol designs determine whether AI shopping is reliable at scale."
2. **Protocol Semantic Design:** "I design the product schema language and merchant verification APIs that make AI agent transactions trustworthy. These semantic decisions determine whether AI agents can shop accurately — or make costly mistakes."
3. **Stripe/Adyen Sr Parity:** "Stripe and Adyen senior engineers earn $368K+ TC. Klarna senior architects building the agentic commerce protocol deserve competitive comp for defining how AI shopping works."
4. **AI Agent Authentication Architecture:** "I design the authentication layer that verifies AI agents can transact on behalf of users — the trust infrastructure that makes autonomous shopping commercially viable across 500,000+ merchants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $252K base and $292K RSUs over 4 years for this Senior Software Engineer role architecting the Agentic Product Protocol. I design the subsystems — product schemas, merchant verification, transaction orchestration — that make AI shopping work at scale. I have competing offers from [Stripe Sr at $448K TC / Adyen Sr at $402K TC / Block Sr at $388K TC]. Senior Common Language Architects defining the protocol for AI commerce are rare and command premium comp." Accept at $235K+ base and $262K+ RSUs.
