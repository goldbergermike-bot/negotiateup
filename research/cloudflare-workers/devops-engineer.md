### 🏗️ Cloudflare Workers AI GPU Fleet Operations Lever

Cloudflare's 2026 Workers AI strategy requires DevOps Engineers to manage GPU infrastructure distributed across 300+ global edge locations — orchestrating AI model deployments, managing heterogeneous GPU hardware across different data centers, and building automation that maintains AI inference quality while optimizing GPU utilization at planetary scale.

DevOps Engineers must build deployment systems that can roll out AI model updates across 300+ locations within minutes, manage GPU health monitoring at global scale, and build capacity planning tools that predict AI workload growth across the edge network.

**Global Levers**

1. **Global GPU Fleet Operations:** "I manage Cloudflare's distributed GPU fleet across 300+ data centers — orchestrating AI model deployments, monitoring GPU health, and optimizing utilization for Workers AI at planetary scale. Managing GPU infrastructure at this geographic distribution is unique."
2. **Edge Deployment Automation:** "I build deployment systems that propagate changes across 300+ global data centers within minutes — managing both traditional edge computing and AI inference workloads. Planetary-scale deployment automation requires exceptional engineering."
3. **Heterogeneous Infrastructure Management:** "I manage heterogeneous compute across Cloudflare's edge — CPU and GPU resources with varying capabilities across different data center tiers. Optimizing workload placement at this scale requires novel infrastructure tooling."
4. **Fastly/AWS/Google Competition:** "Fastly, AWS, and Google are hiring DevOps engineers for edge infrastructure operations. Cloudflare must offer competitive comp to retain engineers who can manage globally distributed AI infrastructure."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $212K base and $278K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this DevOps Engineer role. I manage Cloudflare's GPU fleet and edge infrastructure across 300+ global data centers — including Workers AI deployment and GPU operations at planetary scale. DevOps engineers with globally distributed GPU fleet expertise are exceptionally rare. I have competing offers from [Google SRE at $342K TC / AWS at $328K TC / Fastly at $312K TC]. Engineers who can manage AI inference infrastructure at global edge scale are in peak demand." Accept at $188K+ base and $228K+ RSUs.
