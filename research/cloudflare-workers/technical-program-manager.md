**Negotiation DNA**

Cloudflare Workers Technical Program Managers drive execution of complex programs spanning edge AI deployment, platform development, GPU infrastructure expansion, and developer experience improvements — coordinating delivery across engineering teams for a platform serving 20M+ developers across 300+ global data centers. In February 2026, TPMs manage the interdependencies between Workers AI rollout, GPU fleet expansion across global data centers, core platform stability, and developer ecosystem growth.

As a $30B+ NYSE company, Cloudflare offers liquid RSU packages for TPMs. The Workers platform program complexity is unique — every program must consider 300+ data center locations with varying hardware capabilities, network conditions, and regulatory requirements.

### 🏗️ Cloudflare Workers AI Global Deployment Program Lever

Cloudflare's 2026 Workers AI expansion requires TPMs to manage the global GPU deployment program — coordinating hardware procurement, data center upgrades, and AI inference enablement across 300+ locations simultaneously. This is one of the most geographically complex infrastructure programs in tech, requiring coordination across dozens of data center partners, hardware vendors, and internal engineering teams.

TPMs must manage programs that span hardware, software, and go-to-market — ensuring GPU deployment timing aligns with AI feature readiness, developer demand, and marketing launches.

**Global Levers**

1. **Global GPU Deployment Program:** "I manage the Workers AI GPU deployment program — coordinating hardware procurement, data center upgrades, and AI enablement across 300+ global locations. Managing infrastructure programs at this geographic scale requires exceptional coordination expertise."
2. **Edge Platform Program Complexity:** "Every Workers program must account for 300+ data center locations with varying capabilities. I manage this unprecedented geographic program complexity while maintaining delivery velocity and quality."
3. **Developer Platform Launch Coordination:** "I coordinate developer platform launches — aligning AI feature readiness, documentation, developer relations, and marketing across global regions. Platform launch coordination at this scale directly drives developer adoption."
4. **AWS/Google/Fastly Competition:** "AWS, Google, and Fastly are hiring TPMs for infrastructure platform programs. Cloudflare must offer competitive comp to retain TPMs who can manage globally distributed AI infrastructure programs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $288K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Technical Program Manager role. I manage the Workers AI global deployment program — coordinating GPU infrastructure across 300+ data centers for 20M+ developers. TPMs with globally distributed AI infrastructure program expertise are rare. I have competing offers from [Google TPM at $352K TC / AWS TPM at $340K TC / Fastly TPM at $322K TC]. Technical program managers who can manage planetary-scale AI infrastructure programs are in exceptional demand." Accept at $198K+ base and $238K+ RSUs.
