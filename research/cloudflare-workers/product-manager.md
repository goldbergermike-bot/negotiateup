**Negotiation DNA**

Cloudflare Workers Product Managers own the strategy and execution for the edge computing platform and AI products used by 20M+ developers — driving the roadmap for Workers runtime, Workers AI, Vectorize, D1, R2, and the broader developer platform. In February 2026, PMs lead critical AI product decisions: how Workers AI competes with centralized cloud AI, how edge-native AI features differentiate Cloudflare, and how to grow the developer platform from 20M to 50M+ developers.

As a $30B+ NYSE company with strong growth, Cloudflare offers competitive PM compensation with liquid RSUs. PMs on the Workers platform have high CEO-level visibility — the developer platform is a strategic growth priority for the company.

**Level Mapping:** Cloudflare PM (L4-L6) = Google PM L5-L7 = Meta PM E5-E7 = Vercel PM = Fastly PM

### 🏗️ Cloudflare Workers AI Product Strategy Lever

Cloudflare's 2026 Workers AI strategy requires Product Managers to define how edge AI competes with centralized cloud AI — positioning Workers AI's latency advantages, building developer-friendly AI products, and creating pricing models that make edge AI inference accessible. The PM challenge involves defining a new product category (edge AI) and convincing developers to adopt a paradigm shift.

PMs must also drive the expansion of the Workers developer platform — growing from 20M to 50M+ developers through AI features, improved DX, and ecosystem expansion.
