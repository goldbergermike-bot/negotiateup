**Negotiation DNA**

Cloudflare Workers Data Scientists drive platform intelligence — analyzing how 20M+ developers use edge computing and AI inference, measuring Workers AI adoption and performance, and building models that optimize the global edge network across 300+ data centers. In February 2026, Data Scientists are critical to Cloudflare's Workers AI strategy, quantifying the value of edge AI inference versus centralized cloud, measuring developer platform adoption, and predicting infrastructure capacity needs.

As a $30B+ NYSE company with strong growth, Cloudflare offers competitive DS compensation with liquid RSUs. Data Scientists have unique analytical opportunities — the global edge network generates data at planetary scale with patterns no other company can observe.

### 🏗️ Cloudflare Workers AI Platform Intelligence Lever

Cloudflare's 2026 Workers AI expansion requires Data Scientists to measure and optimize AI inference at the edge — quantifying latency improvements from edge-deployed AI models, analyzing inference cost efficiency across global regions, and building models that predict AI workload patterns to optimize GPU allocation.

Data Scientists must develop novel analytics frameworks for edge-distributed AI — measuring performance across 300+ heterogeneous data centers with varying hardware configurations and network conditions.

**Global Levers**

1. **Edge AI Performance Analytics:** "I measure and optimize Workers AI inference performance — quantifying latency, throughput, and cost efficiency across 300+ global data centers. Edge AI analytics at this geographic scale is unprecedented."
2. **Developer Platform Intelligence:** "I analyze how 20M+ developers use Cloudflare's platform — building models that predict adoption patterns, identify expansion opportunities, and optimize the developer experience across edge computing and AI features."
3. **Global Network Optimization:** "I build models that optimize Cloudflare's global edge network — predicting traffic patterns, AI workload distribution, and capacity needs across 300+ locations. Network optimization at this scale requires unique analytical approaches."
4. **Datadog/Fastly/AWS Competition:** "Datadog, Fastly, and AWS are hiring data scientists for platform analytics. Cloudflare must offer competitive comp to retain DS talent with edge computing and AI analytics expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $228K base and $305K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Data Scientist role. I measure and optimize Workers AI inference across 300+ global edge locations — quantifying performance, cost efficiency, and developer adoption. Data scientists with edge AI analytics expertise are rare. I have competing offers from [Google at $368K TC / Datadog at $348K TC / AWS at $342K TC]. Data scientists who can analyze AI performance at planetary scale are in exceptional demand." Accept at $200K+ base and $250K+ RSUs.
