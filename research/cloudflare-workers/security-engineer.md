### Security Engineer | Cloudflare Workers Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Heavy (NYSE: NET) + Bonus | Edge Security & AI Infrastructure Protection | $30B+ Market Cap | 20M+ Developers | **WORKERS AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $188K–$238K | $175K–$308K | 10–15% | $270K–$378K |
| Austin | $178K–$228K | $165K–$295K | 10–15% | $258K–$362K |
| London | £125K–£158K | £115K–£205K | 10–15% | £178K–£248K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Cloudflare Workers Security Engineers protect the edge computing platform serving 20M+ developers — securing the Workers runtime sandbox, AI inference infrastructure, and multi-tenant isolation across 300+ global data centers. In February 2026, the Workers AI expansion adds critical security challenges: protecting AI model weights deployed at the edge, preventing inference data leakage across tenants, and securing the AI Gateway that routes developer AI API calls. As a company known for internet security, Cloudflare's own platform security is existential.

As a $30B+ NYSE security company, Cloudflare offers competitive security engineer compensation with liquid RSUs. Security Engineers at Cloudflare protect infrastructure that itself protects millions of websites — a unique recursive security challenge with extremely high stakes.

### 🏗️ Cloudflare Workers AI Edge Security Lever

Cloudflare's 2026 Workers AI strategy requires Security Engineers to solve novel edge AI security challenges — protecting AI model weights from extraction across 300+ physically distributed locations, ensuring inference data isolation in a multi-tenant edge environment, and building security controls for the AI Gateway that processes developer AI API calls at planetary scale.

Security Engineers must develop threat models for edge-deployed AI — a fundamentally different security surface than centralized cloud AI, with unique risks around physical hardware access, edge-specific attack vectors, and the challenge of maintaining security consistency across hundreds of independently operated data center locations.

**Global Levers**

1. **Edge AI Security Architecture:** "I build the security architecture for Workers AI — protecting model weights, inference data, and AI Gateway operations across 300+ physically distributed data centers. Edge AI security at this geographic scale is a frontier challenge."
2. **Workers Runtime Sandbox Security:** "I secure the Workers runtime sandbox — the V8 isolate environment that executes untrusted code for 20M+ developers. Maintaining runtime security at this scale while enabling AI workloads requires exceptional security engineering."
3. **Multi-Tenant Edge Isolation:** "I build multi-tenant isolation controls across 300+ edge locations — ensuring one developer's AI workloads cannot access another's data or models. Physical distribution makes tenant isolation uniquely challenging."
4. **CrowdStrike/Palo Alto/Zscaler Competition:** "CrowdStrike, Palo Alto, and Zscaler are hiring security engineers for infrastructure protection. Cloudflare must offer competitive comp to retain security talent with edge AI security expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $230K base and $300K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Security Engineer role. I build the security architecture for Workers AI — protecting model weights and inference data across 300+ physically distributed data centers. Security engineers with edge AI infrastructure expertise are in extreme shortage. I have competing offers from [Google SecEng at $368K TC / CrowdStrike at $350K TC / Palo Alto at $345K TC]. Security engineers who can protect globally distributed AI inference are the scarcest security talent in 2026." Accept at $202K+ base and $248K+ RSUs.
