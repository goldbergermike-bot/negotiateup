### Senior Software Engineer | Cloudflare Workers Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Heavy (NYSE: NET) + Bonus | Edge AI Runtime & Developer Platform | $30B+ Market Cap | 20M+ Developers | **WORKERS AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $192K–$245K | $185K–$325K | 10–15% | $282K–$395K |
| Austin | $182K–$235K | $175K–$310K | 10–15% | $268K–$378K |
| London | £128K–£162K | £122K–£215K | 10–15% | £182K–£258K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Cloudflare Workers Senior Software Engineers build and scale the edge computing platform — the Workers runtime, AI inference layer, storage products (R2, D1, KV, Vectorize), and developer tools used by 20M+ developers across 300+ global data centers. In February 2026, senior engineers lead the technical execution of Workers AI integration, building the systems that enable AI inference at the edge alongside traditional serverless workloads.

As a $30B+ NYSE company, Cloudflare offers competitive RSU packages with strong liquidity. Senior engineers have significant impact — the Workers platform is a critical growth engine, and the lean team means each senior engineer owns major system components.

### 🏗️ Cloudflare Workers AI Runtime Integration Lever

Cloudflare's 2026 Workers AI strategy requires Senior Software Engineers to integrate AI inference capabilities into the Workers runtime — building the systems that let developers call AI models from within Workers functions, manage AI Gateway routing, and store AI data in Vectorize, all within the edge computing paradigm.

Senior engineers must solve the unique challenge of extending a V8-based serverless runtime to support AI workloads — managing GPU resource allocation alongside CPU isolates, building APIs that abstract edge AI complexity, and maintaining the performance characteristics developers expect from edge computing.

**Global Levers**

1. **Workers AI Runtime Integration:** "I build the AI inference integration in the Workers runtime — enabling developers to call AI models, manage vector data, and route AI API calls from edge functions across 300+ data centers for 20M+ developers."
2. **Edge Storage Platform:** "I build Cloudflare's edge storage products — R2, D1, KV, and Vectorize — the data layer for edge applications. Distributed storage at 300+ locations with strong consistency guarantees is a unique systems engineering challenge."
3. **Serverless Runtime Architecture:** "I extend the Workers V8 runtime to support AI workloads alongside traditional serverless functions — managing GPU resource allocation, inference queuing, and cold start optimization at global edge scale."
4. **Vercel/Fastly/Deno Competition:** "Vercel, Fastly, and Deno are competing for senior engineers building edge runtimes with AI capabilities. Cloudflare must offer competitive comp to retain senior talent with edge AI runtime expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $238K base and $318K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Senior Software Engineer role. I build the Workers AI runtime integration and edge storage products — enabling AI inference at 300+ global locations for 20M+ developers. Senior engineers with edge AI runtime expertise are rare. I have competing offers from [Google at $385K TC / Vercel at $368K TC / AWS at $372K TC]. Senior engineers who can build AI-integrated edge computing platforms are in peak demand." Accept at $210K+ base and $262K+ RSUs.
