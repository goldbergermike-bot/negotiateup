### 🏗️ Cloudflare Workers AI Platform Leadership Lever

Cloudflare's 2026 Workers AI strategy requires Engineering Managers to lead teams building AI capabilities at the edge — managing engineers who deploy AI models across 300+ data centers, build vector databases on the edge, and create developer tools for AI-powered applications. The leadership challenge involves managing teams that span traditional edge computing, GPU infrastructure, and ML systems.

EMs must balance the rapid expansion of AI capabilities with core platform reliability, manage the unique complexity of globally distributed engineering, and build teams that can innovate at the intersection of edge computing and AI inference.

**Global Levers**

1. **Workers AI Team Leadership:** "I lead the engineering team building Workers AI — deploying AI inference across 300+ global data centers for 20M+ developers. Leading edge AI platform teams requires rare expertise spanning distributed systems, GPU infrastructure, and developer experience."
2. **Global Edge Platform Complexity:** "Cloudflare's edge platform operates across 300+ data centers on every continent. I lead teams managing this unprecedented geographic distribution while shipping features that work reliably at planetary scale."
3. **Developer Platform Growth:** "I drive the technical strategy for Cloudflare's developer platform — the primary growth engine for 20M+ developers. My leadership decisions directly impact developer adoption and platform revenue."
4. **Fastly/Vercel/AWS Competition:** "Fastly, Vercel, and AWS are competing for engineering leaders in edge computing and AI. Cloudflare must offer competitive leadership comp to retain EMs driving the Workers AI platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $265K base and $450K RSUs over 4 years with 20% performance bonus for this Engineering Manager role. I lead the Workers AI engineering team — deploying AI inference across 300+ global data centers for 20M+ developers. Engineering leaders with edge AI platform expertise are exceptionally rare. I have competing offers from [Google EM at $498K TC / AWS EM at $478K TC / Meta EM at $505K TC]. EMs who can lead globally distributed AI infrastructure teams are in extraordinary demand." Accept at $238K+ base and $378K+ RSUs.
