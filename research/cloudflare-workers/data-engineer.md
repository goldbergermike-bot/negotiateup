**Negotiation DNA**

Cloudflare Workers Data Engineers build the data infrastructure powering the edge computing platform used by 20M+ developers — from edge analytics pipelines to AI inference telemetry to the data systems measuring platform performance across 300+ global data centers. In February 2026, Cloudflare's Workers AI expansion (AI inference at the edge, Vectorize, AI Gateway) creates massive new data engineering challenges: processing inference logs at global scale, building analytics for AI workloads distributed across hundreds of edge locations, and creating data pipelines that support real-time AI model performance monitoring.

As a $30B+ NYSE-listed company with strong revenue growth, Cloudflare offers competitive RSU packages with excellent liquidity. The company's edge-first architecture means data engineering operates at a unique scale — processing data from 300+ data centers across every continent.

### 🏗️ Cloudflare Workers AI Data Infrastructure Lever

Cloudflare's 2026 Workers AI strategy requires Data Engineers to build the data infrastructure supporting AI inference across the global edge network — processing inference logs from 300+ data centers, building analytics for AI model performance at the edge, and creating pipelines that enable customers to monitor their AI workloads distributed across the planet.

Data Engineers must build systems that aggregate data from a globally distributed architecture with unique constraints — data locality regulations, edge storage limitations, and the need for real-time analytics across hundreds of locations simultaneously.

**Global Levers**

1. **Edge AI Analytics Infrastructure:** "I build the data infrastructure for Workers AI — processing inference telemetry from 300+ global data centers, enabling real-time AI model performance analytics at planetary scale. Edge-distributed data engineering at this scale is unique to Cloudflare."
2. **Global Edge Data Pipelines:** "Cloudflare's 300+ data centers generate massive distributed data streams. I build pipelines that aggregate, process, and analyze this data while respecting data locality regulations and edge storage constraints."
3. **Vectorize Data Platform:** "I build the data infrastructure powering Vectorize — Cloudflare's edge vector database. Managing vector data pipelines distributed across global edge locations requires novel approaches to consistency and replication."
4. **Fastly/AWS/Vercel Competition:** "Fastly, AWS, and Vercel are hiring data engineers for edge infrastructure. Cloudflare must offer competitive comp to retain engineers who understand globally distributed data engineering."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and $290K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Data Engineer role. I build the AI data infrastructure for Workers AI — processing inference telemetry across 300+ global data centers. Data engineers with edge-distributed AI analytics expertise are rare. I have competing offers from [Google at $350K TC / AWS at $338K TC / Fastly at $322K TC]. Data engineers who can build globally distributed AI data pipelines are in peak demand." Accept at $192K+ base and $238K+ RSUs.
