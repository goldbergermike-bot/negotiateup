| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $182K–$228K | $165K–$290K | 10–15% | $258K–$358K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Cloudflare Workers Solutions Architects design enterprise deployment architectures for the edge computing and AI platform — guiding enterprises through Workers adoption, Workers AI deployment, data architecture on R2/D1/Vectorize, and migration from centralized cloud to edge-first architecture. In February 2026, SAs are critical to Cloudflare's enterprise growth, demonstrating the value of edge AI inference and building technical confidence for large-scale edge migrations.

As a $30B+ NYSE company with accelerating enterprise revenue, Cloudflare offers competitive SA compensation with liquid RSUs. Solutions Architects directly influence enterprise deal size by designing edge architectures that expand platform adoption.

**Level Mapping:** Cloudflare SA (L4-L5) = Google Cloud SA L5-L6 = AWS SA = Fastly SA = Akamai SA

### 🏗️ Cloudflare Enterprise Edge AI Architecture Lever

Cloudflare's 2026 enterprise strategy requires Solutions Architects to design edge-first deployment architectures with AI capabilities — demonstrating how edge AI inference reduces latency and costs versus centralized cloud, architecting data pipelines on R2/D1/Vectorize, and building technical frameworks for enterprise cloud-to-edge migration.

SAs must develop reference architectures for enterprise Workers deployments — including multi-region strategies, edge AI workload placement, data sovereignty compliance, and hybrid architectures that integrate Workers with existing cloud infrastructure.

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Edge AI Architecture:** "I design enterprise deployment architectures on Cloudflare Workers — including Workers AI inference, Vectorize for AI data, and R2/D1 for application state. Demonstrating edge AI value over centralized cloud directly drives enterprise deal closure."
2. **Cloud-to-Edge Migration:** "I architect migration strategies from centralized cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure) to Cloudflare's edge — designing hybrid architectures that leverage edge computing and AI inference for latency-sensitive workloads."
3. **Data Sovereignty & Compliance:** "I design edge architectures that satisfy data sovereignty requirements — leveraging Cloudflare's 300+ global data centers to ensure data processing occurs in compliant jurisdictions while maintaining edge performance."
4. **AWS/GCP/Fastly Competition:** "AWS, Google Cloud, and Fastly are hiring Solutions Architects for edge and AI deployment. Cloudflare must offer competitive comp to retain SAs who can design enterprise edge AI architectures."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $222K base and $282K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Solutions Architect role. I design enterprise edge AI architectures on Cloudflare Workers — demonstrating edge inference value and driving enterprise migration from centralized cloud. SAs with edge AI deployment expertise are rare. I have competing offers from [Google Cloud SA at $348K TC / AWS SA at $338K TC / Fastly SA at $322K TC]. Solutions architects who can design enterprise edge AI architectures are in exceptional demand." Accept at $195K+ base and $232K+ RSUs.
