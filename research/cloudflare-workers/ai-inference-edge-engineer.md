### AI Inference Edge Engineer | Cloudflare Workers Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Heavy (NYSE: NET) + Bonus | Edge AI Inference Optimization & GPU Orchestration | $30B+ Market Cap | 300+ Data Centers | **WORKERS AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $205K–$262K | $228K–$395K | 10–15% | $325K–$455K |
| Austin | $195K–$252K | $218K–$380K | 10–15% | $312K–$438K |
| London | £138K–£175K | £150K–£262K | 10–15% | £212K–£298K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Cloudflare AI Inference Edge Engineers build the core AI inference system running across Cloudflare's global edge network — optimizing model execution on edge GPUs, building the inference orchestration layer that routes AI workloads across 300+ data centers, and developing the runtime that enables developers to deploy custom AI models at the edge through Workers AI. In February 2026, this is Cloudflare's most strategically critical technical role, as AI inference at the edge is the company's primary differentiator against centralized cloud AI providers. These engineers solve the hardest problems in edge AI: minimizing inference latency through model optimization, managing GPU memory across diverse hardware, and building inference scheduling systems that maximize utilization at planetary scale.

As a $30B+ NYSE company making its largest-ever infrastructure investment in edge AI, Cloudflare offers premium compensation for AI inference talent with liquid RSUs. This role competes directly with NVIDIA, Google, and Meta for engineers who understand AI inference optimization at the hardware level.

### 🏗️ Cloudflare Edge AI Inference Optimization Lever

Cloudflare's 2026 edge AI strategy requires AI Inference Edge Engineers to build the most efficient AI inference system in the world — running models closer to users than any centralized cloud provider. The engineering challenge involves optimizing model execution across heterogeneous edge GPUs (NVIDIA T4, L4, and custom accelerators) with varying memory and compute budgets, building batching systems that maximize GPU utilization across fluctuating workloads, and developing quantization pipelines that maintain model quality while fitting within edge constraints.

AI Inference Edge Engineers must build inference orchestration that routes requests to the optimal edge location based on model availability, GPU load, and network latency — a multi-dimensional scheduling problem operating at planetary scale with sub-millisecond decision requirements.

**Global Levers**

1. **Edge Inference Optimization:** "I build Cloudflare's edge AI inference system — optimizing model execution across heterogeneous GPUs at 300+ global locations. Sub-10ms inference at the edge requires model quantization, memory optimization, and scheduling innovations that don't exist in centralized cloud AI."
2. **GPU Orchestration at Scale:** "I build the inference orchestration layer that routes AI workloads across 300+ data centers — maximizing GPU utilization through intelligent batching, request routing, and model placement. GPU orchestration at this geographic scale is unprecedented."
3. **Model Deployment Pipeline:** "I build the model deployment pipeline that enables developers to deploy custom AI models to Cloudflare's global edge — optimizing, quantizing, and distributing models to 300+ locations within minutes. Edge model deployment at this scale is a unique systems challenge."
4. **NVIDIA/Google/Meta Competition:** "NVIDIA, Google, and Meta are competing for inference optimization engineers. Cloudflare must offer competitive comp to retain engineers who can optimize AI inference for globally distributed edge hardware."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $255K base and $385K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this AI Inference Edge Engineer role. I build Cloudflare's edge AI inference system — optimizing model execution and GPU orchestration across 300+ global data centers. AI inference engineers with edge optimization expertise at this scale are among the rarest talent in 2026. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $445K TC / Google AI Infra at $435K TC / Meta AI Infra at $440K TC]. Engineers who can optimize AI inference for globally distributed edge hardware are in extraordinary demand." Accept at $228K+ base and $322K+ RSUs.
