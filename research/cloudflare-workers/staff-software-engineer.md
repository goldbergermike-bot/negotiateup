### 🏗️ Cloudflare Workers AI Architecture Strategy Lever

Cloudflare's 2026 Workers AI transformation requires Staff Software Engineers to define the technical architecture of the edge AI platform — foundational decisions about how AI inference integrates with the serverless runtime, how GPU resources are managed alongside CPU isolates, and how the platform evolves from serverless computing to serverless AI. Staff engineers drive the architectural vision that makes edge AI a competitive advantage over centralized cloud.

Staff engineers must align engineering teams across runtime, AI, storage, and networking on a unified platform architecture, establish technical patterns for AI feature development at the edge, and define the system evolution that supports Cloudflare's ambitious growth targets.

**Global Levers**

1. **Edge AI Platform Architecture:** "I define the technical architecture for Workers AI — foundational decisions about AI inference integration, GPU resource management, and runtime evolution across 300+ global data centers that define Cloudflare's edge AI competitive position."
2. **Serverless-to-AI Evolution:** "I drive the Workers platform evolution from serverless computing to serverless AI — architectural decisions that transform the edge platform to support AI-first workloads at planetary scale."
3. **Cross-Team Technical Strategy:** "I set technical direction across Workers runtime, AI, storage, and networking teams — driving architectural alignment that enables rapid AI expansion while maintaining edge platform reliability for 20M+ developers."
4. **Google/AWS/Meta Competition:** "Google, AWS, and Meta are competing for Staff engineers with AI platform architecture expertise. Cloudflare must offer competitive comp to retain Staff talent defining the edge AI platform vision."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $280K base and $468K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Staff Software Engineer role. I define the Workers AI platform architecture — foundational decisions about edge AI inference, GPU management, and runtime evolution across 300+ global data centers. Staff engineers with edge AI platform architecture expertise are among the rarest in tech. I have competing offers from [Google L7 at $525K TC / AWS Staff at $505K TC / Meta Staff at $518K TC]. Staff engineers who can define edge AI platform architecture are in extraordinary demand." Accept at $252K+ base and $395K+ RSUs.
