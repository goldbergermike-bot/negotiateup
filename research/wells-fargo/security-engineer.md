### Security Engineer | Wells Fargo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $225B market cap bank + Cybersecurity critical to rebuilding trust + SF HQ tech market rates + Regulatory scrutiny demands top security talent | Wells Fargo security carries reputational premium | **TRUST REBUILDING SECURITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco (HQ) | $148K–$205K | $42K–$110K/yr | 18–28% | $198K–$325K |
| New York City | $145K–$200K | $40K–$105K/yr | 18–28% | $195K–$315K |
| Charlotte | $132K–$185K | $35K–$90K/yr | 18–28% | $175K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Wells Fargo protect one of the world's largest financial institutions during a period of heightened regulatory scrutiny. The bank's cybersecurity operation defends assets serving 70+ million customers, billions in daily transactions, and critical financial infrastructure. Security is particularly important to Wells Fargo's trust rebuilding strategy: a security incident would be catastrophic to the bank's reputation recovery efforts. This makes cybersecurity an absolute top priority with corresponding budget and compensation support.

Security Engineers hold VP or SVP titles with compensation as base plus discretionary bonus (18-28%) plus equity and deferred compensation. The SF headquarters means competing with Bay Area cybersecurity salaries, driving compensation higher than peer banks. Wells Fargo has been investing heavily in its security organization, expanding headcount and increasing compensation to attract talent from cybersecurity vendors, tech companies, and government agencies.

Competition comes from CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Google, Apple, and other banks. Wells Fargo's security challenge -- protecting a bank under regulatory scrutiny during a technology transformation -- provides unique and career-defining experience.

**The Regulatory Security Premium**

Wells Fargo's regulatory environment creates extraordinary security requirements. The bank operates under consent orders that specifically address technology risk management, which includes cybersecurity. Security engineers who can strengthen the bank's security posture while satisfying OCC, Federal Reserve, and CFPB expectations are directly contributing to the bank's ability to operate without restriction. This regulatory dimension adds a layer of strategic importance -- and corresponding compensation premium -- that standard cybersecurity roles lack.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [CrowdStrike/Google/JPMorgan] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to Wells Fargo's security challenges, but Bay Area security talent commands premium compensation. Can we increase the base to $[target]?"
2. **Trust Rebuilding Impact:** "Cybersecurity is directly tied to Wells Fargo's trust rebuilding strategy. The existential importance of this role justifies above-band compensation."
3. **Regulatory Security Expertise:** "My experience in [banking security/OCC compliance/regulatory security frameworks] is essential and scarce. This justifies a base of $[target]."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[40K-65K] would offset the forfeiture."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about strengthening Wells Fargo's security posture. I have a competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Google] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Wells Fargo, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $50K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
