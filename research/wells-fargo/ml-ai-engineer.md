**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Wells Fargo are modernizing the bank's machine learning capabilities across fraud detection, credit risk assessment, customer personalization, and regulatory compliance. The bank's transformation creates a unique opportunity: engineers are building modern ML platforms and deploying production models to replace legacy statistical approaches. Wells Fargo's ML teams work on systems that process billions of transactions, make millions of credit decisions, and protect 70+ million customers from fraud.

ML/AI Engineers hold VP or SVP titles with compensation as base plus discretionary bonus (18-28% at VP, 25-40% at SVP) plus equity and deferred compensation. ML roles command 10-15% above SWE bands at Wells Fargo, and the SF location means the bank competes with Bay Area AI labs, tech companies, and hedge funds for ML talent. The bank has been aggressively hiring ML engineers from tech companies, offering packages that approach tech-company levels.

Competition comes from Google, Meta, Apple (all nearby), hedge funds, and other banks. Wells Fargo's greenfield ML opportunity -- building modern ML infrastructure from scratch -- is a differentiator for engineers who want to architect rather than maintain.

**Level Mapping:** ML/AI Engineer at WF (VP/SVP) = L4-L5 at Google, E4-E5 at Meta, Applied Scientist at Amazon, Senior ML at Capital One, VP/ED at JPMorgan

**The ML Modernization Premium**

Wells Fargo's ML modernization represents one of the largest ML transformation programs in financial services. The bank is replacing legacy statistical models with modern deep learning, deploying ML platforms for automated model training and monitoring, and building responsible AI frameworks that satisfy regulatory requirements. ML engineers who can lead this modernization -- bringing tech-company ML engineering practices to a regulated banking environment -- are in exceptional demand. The combination of Bay Area market rates and transformation urgency creates strong negotiation leverage.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Meta/Capital One] at $[X] total comp for an ML role. I'm excited about Wells Fargo's ML modernization, but the Bay Area market demands competitive ML compensation. Can we increase the base to $[target]?"
2. **Revenue Impact:** "ML models in fraud detection and credit risk directly impact Wells Fargo's P&L by billions annually. This revenue attribution justifies an above-band package."
3. **Regulatory ML Expertise:** "My experience with [explainable ML/fair lending models/model risk management] in financial services is directly applicable and scarce. This commands $[X] in the Bay Area market."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested equity. A sign-on of $[40K-70K] would offset the forfeiture."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about building Wells Fargo's modern ML platform. I have a competing offer from [Google/Capital One] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Wells Fargo, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $55K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
