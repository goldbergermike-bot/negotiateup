### Solutions Architect | Wells Fargo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $225B market cap bank + Architecture drives the entire rebuilding strategy + SF HQ tech market rates + Architects are most critical hires during transformation | Wells Fargo SAs define the bank's future technology landscape | **TRANSFORMATION ARCHITECTURE PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco (HQ) | $155K–$215K | $48K–$120K/yr | 18–28% | $210K–$345K |
| New York City | $152K–$210K | $45K–$115K/yr | 18–28% | $205K–$335K |
| Charlotte | $140K–$195K | $40K–$100K/yr | 18–28% | $190K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Wells Fargo are arguably the most strategically important technology hires during the bank's rebuilding. SAs (SVP or Director titles) design the target-state architecture for systems that serve 70+ million customers, making decisions that will define the bank's technology landscape for decades. The architecture challenge is immense: bridging decades-old mainframe systems with modern cloud-native platforms while maintaining regulatory compliance, operational resilience, and business continuity.

Compensation follows the banking model: base plus discretionary bonus (18-28% at SVP, 25-40% at Director) plus equity and deferred compensation. Architecture roles are compensated at or above senior engineering levels. Wells Fargo's SF location and the criticality of architecture during the transformation drive compensation to the upper end of bank ranges. The bank has been recruiting architects from tech companies and cloud providers, offering packages that approach tech-company levels.

Competition comes from AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, consulting firms, and other banks. Wells Fargo's transformation architecture work provides career-defining experience that is valued across industries.

**The Transformation Architecture Premium**

Architecture during a bank's technology transformation is a rare and high-impact role. SAs at Wells Fargo are not maintaining existing architecture -- they are designing the bank's next-generation technology platform from the ground up. Their decisions on cloud strategy, microservices decomposition, data architecture, and integration patterns will shape how Wells Fargo operates for the next 20+ years. This strategic impact, combined with Bay Area market rates, justifies premium compensation packages.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [AWS/Google Cloud/JPMorgan] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to Wells Fargo's architecture challenge, but the Bay Area market demands competitive compensation. Can we increase the base to $[target]?"
2. **Strategic Architecture Impact:** "My architecture decisions will define Wells Fargo's technology platform for decades, influencing investments worth $[X]B+. This strategic impact justifies Director-level compensation."
3. **Migration Architecture Expertise:** "My experience architecting [cloud migration/legacy modernization/enterprise transformation] at scale is exactly what Wells Fargo needs. This scarce expertise commands $[X]."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[45K-75K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about designing Wells Fargo's future architecture. I have a competing offer from [AWS/JPMorgan] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Wells Fargo, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $60K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
