**Negotiation DNA:** $225B market cap bank + Redesigning banking experience for 70M+ customers + SF HQ in design-rich market + Rebuilding brand through design excellence | Wells Fargo design is central to reputation recovery | **BRAND REBUILDING PREMIUM**

|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco (HQ) | $128K–$175K | $32K–$75K/yr | 15–22% | $165K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Wells Fargo are redesigning the banking experience for over 70 million customers as part of the bank's brand and technology transformation. Design quality is directly tied to Wells Fargo's reputation recovery strategy: a modern, intuitive digital banking experience is essential to rebuilding customer trust. Designers work across the mobile app, online banking, branch digital experiences, and wealth management platforms, with the design organization receiving increased investment and executive support.

Designers hold VP or AVP titles with compensation as base plus discretionary bonus (15-22%) plus equity and deferred compensation. The SF headquarters puts Wells Fargo in direct competition with some of the world's best design organizations (Apple, Google, Figma, Airbnb), driving design compensation higher than peer banks. Wells Fargo has been recruiting design leaders from tech companies to elevate the design practice.

Competition comes from nearby tech companies, fintech firms, and design agencies. Wells Fargo's advantage is the scale and impact: redesigning banking for 70M+ customers during a brand transformation is a rare and portfolio-defining opportunity.

**The Brand Transformation Design Premium**

Wells Fargo's design team carries unique strategic importance. Design quality directly impacts brand perception, customer trust, and digital adoption -- all critical metrics for the bank's reputation recovery. Designers who can elevate the Wells Fargo experience to compete with fintech apps and tech-forward banks have measurable impact on the bank's most important strategic objective: rebuilding customer trust. This strategic importance gives designers more negotiation leverage than at banks where design is a support function rather than a strategic priority.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Figma/Apple/Capital One] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to Wells Fargo's design transformation, but the Bay Area design market demands competitive pay. Can we increase the base to $[target]?"
2. **Brand Impact:** "My design work will directly impact brand perception and customer trust for 70M+ users. This strategic impact justifies an above-band package."
3. **Bay Area Design Market:** "Product designers in the Bay Area command $[X] total comp. I need the offer to be market-competitive."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested equity. A sign-on of $[25K-45K] would offset the forfeiture."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about redesigning Wells Fargo's customer experience. I have a competing offer from [tech company] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Wells Fargo, I'd need the base at $[X+10K], guaranteed first-year bonus, and a sign-on of $35K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
