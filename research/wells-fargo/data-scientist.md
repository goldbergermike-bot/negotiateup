### Data Scientist | Wells Fargo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $225B market cap bank + DS critical for risk, fraud, and compliance modeling + SF HQ tech market rates + Rebuilding reputation drives premium hiring | Wells Fargo DS roles carry regulatory urgency | **RISK ANALYTICS PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco (HQ) | $148K–$205K | $45K–$110K/yr | 18–28% | $200K–$320K |
| New York City | $145K–$200K | $42K–$105K/yr | 18–28% | $195K–$310K |
| Charlotte | $132K–$185K | $38K–$90K/yr | 18–28% | $178K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Wells Fargo build the statistical models, machine learning systems, and analytical frameworks that power credit risk assessment, fraud detection, regulatory stress testing, marketing analytics, and customer personalization. The bank's regulatory environment creates unique demand for data scientists who can build models that are both performant and explainable to regulators. Wells Fargo's consent order history has made model risk management a top priority, and data scientists who can navigate MRM governance while delivering business value are in exceptional demand.

DS roles hold VP or SVP titles with compensation as base plus discretionary bonus (18-28% at VP, 25-40% at SVP) plus equity and deferred comp. DS compensation at Wells Fargo runs 10-15% above SWE bands, and the bank's SF location means it competes with Bay Area tech companies and hedge funds for quantitative talent. Wells Fargo has been increasing DS compensation significantly to attract candidates from tech companies who bring modern ML expertise alongside financial modeling skills.

Competition comes from hedge funds, Big Tech, other banks, and fintech. Wells Fargo's rebuilding narrative and the technical challenge of modernizing risk models from legacy approaches to modern ML create a compelling proposition for ambitious data scientists.

**The Regulatory Modeling Premium**

Wells Fargo's regulatory environment creates unique value for data scientists. Models must satisfy OCC and Federal Reserve scrutiny, comply with fair lending requirements, and pass rigorous model validation. Data scientists who can build models that are both statistically powerful and regulatorily compliant are rare. The bank's stress testing program (CCAR/DFAST) alone requires dozens of complex models that must be rebuilt and validated annually, creating sustained demand for quantitative talent.

The rebuilding narrative also creates opportunity: Wells Fargo is replacing legacy statistical models with modern ML approaches, giving data scientists the chance to greenfield new model architectures rather than maintaining inherited models. Candidates with experience in regulated model development, fair lending analytics, or stress testing can negotiate premium packages.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Two Sigma/Google/Capital One] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to Wells Fargo's modeling challenges, but the compensation gap is significant. Can we close it with a base of $[target] and guaranteed bonus?"
2. **Regulatory Modeling Expertise:** "My experience with [CCAR stress testing/fair lending models/model risk management] is directly applicable and extremely scarce. This justifies an above-band package."
3. **Bay Area Market Rate:** "Quantitative data scientists in the Bay Area command $[X] total comp. I need the offer to be market-competitive."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[40K-70K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about modernizing Wells Fargo's models. I have a competing offer from [Google/Capital One] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Wells Fargo, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $55K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
