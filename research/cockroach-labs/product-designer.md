**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5B Valuation) | Distributed SQL Database (CockroachDB) | NYC HQ | High Engineering Bar

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC HQ | $155K–$215K | $70K–$200K | — | $195K–$315K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Cockroach Labs design the UX for CockroachDB Cloud — the managed database console where customers configure, monitor, and manage distributed SQL clusters. The design challenge is making a deeply technical product (distributed SQL database) accessible to database administrators and developers. The CockroachDB Cloud console must visualize cluster topology, query performance, replication status, and data distribution across regions. [Source: Cockroach Labs Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs Senior Designer = MongoDB Senior Designer = PlanetScale Senior Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Infrastructure UX Complexity:** "Designing UX for a distributed SQL database is one of the hardest infrastructure UX challenges. I'm making distributed consensus and multi-region replication understandable to users."
2. **Cloud Console Ownership:** "The CockroachDB Cloud console is the primary interface for enterprise customers. My designs determine the managed service experience."
3. **Technical Domain Depth:** "Database UX requires deep technical understanding of distributed systems, query performance, and cluster management."
4. **MongoDB/Figma Counter:** Both offer competitive design comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $190K over 4 years. I'm designing the UX for one of the most complex infrastructure products — distributed SQL at global scale." Counter at $160K-$180K equity is competitive.
