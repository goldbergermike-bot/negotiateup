**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Cockroach Labs design the UX for CockroachDB Cloud — the managed database console where customers configure, monitor, and manage distributed SQL clusters. The design challenge is making a deeply technical product (distributed SQL database) accessible to database administrators and developers. The CockroachDB Cloud console must visualize cluster topology, query performance, replication status, and data distribution across regions. [Source: Cockroach Labs Design Comp 2025-2026]
