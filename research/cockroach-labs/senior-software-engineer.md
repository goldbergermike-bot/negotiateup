### Senior Software Engineer | Cockroach Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5B Valuation) | Distributed SQL Database (CockroachDB) | NYC HQ | High Engineering Bar

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC HQ | $180K–$240K | $110K–$260K | — | $255K–$380K |
| Remote US | $165K–$225K | $95K–$240K | — | $235K–$355K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at Cockroach Labs own major subsystems of CockroachDB — the SQL optimizer, transaction engine, storage layer, or replication protocol. At this level, engineers make architectural decisions that affect the correctness and performance of every query across every CockroachDB deployment globally. The engineering standard is among the highest in the industry because the product is a database — correctness is non-negotiable. [Source: Cockroach Labs Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs Senior SWE = MongoDB Senior SWE = Google L4 (Spanner) = PlanetScale Senior SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Database Correctness Non-Negotiable:** "At senior level in database engineering, my decisions affect data correctness for every customer. A wrong decision can cause data loss. The engineering bar is the highest in the industry."
2. **Subsystem Architecture Ownership:** "I own major CockroachDB subsystems (SQL optimizer, storage engine, transaction protocol). Each subsystem decision affects global correctness and performance."
3. **Private Equity Premium:** "I need a 30-40% equity premium over liquid alternatives for the illiquidity risk."
4. **Google Spanner/MongoDB Counter:** Both compete for the same deep systems talent.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $250K over 4 years with acceleration. I own CockroachDB subsystems where correctness is non-negotiable, and I have Google Spanner and MongoDB offers." Counter at $210K-$240K equity is strong.
