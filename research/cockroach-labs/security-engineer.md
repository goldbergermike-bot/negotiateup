### Security Engineer | Cockroach Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5B Valuation) | Distributed SQL Database (CockroachDB) | NYC HQ | High Engineering Bar

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC HQ | $170K–$230K | $85K–$235K | — | $225K–$355K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Cockroach Labs protect the most critical layer of the software stack — the database. A database security breach doesn't just expose data; it can compromise the integrity of every transaction, every record, and every application that depends on CockroachDB. Enterprise customers trust CockroachDB with their most sensitive data and require SOC2, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS compliance. The distributed architecture adds security complexity — data replicated across regions must be encrypted in transit and at rest with fine-grained access controls.

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs Senior Security Eng = MongoDB Security Eng = Google L4 Security = CrowdStrike Senior Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Database Security = Data Trust:** "Database security is the foundation of enterprise trust. A CockroachDB security breach would compromise every application built on top of it."
2. **Distributed Security Complexity:** "Securing data replicated across geo-regions with encryption, access controls, and audit logging in a distributed consensus system is exceptionally complex."
3. **Enterprise Compliance Revenue:** "SOC2, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS compliance directly enables enterprise database sales in regulated industries."
4. **CrowdStrike/Palo Alto Counter:** Security companies offer premium comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $225K over 4 years. Database security is the most critical layer — a breach compromises every application." Counter at $190K-$215K equity is competitive.
