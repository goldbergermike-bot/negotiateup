**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Cockroach Labs protect the most critical layer of the software stack — the database. A database security breach doesn't just expose data; it can compromise the integrity of every transaction, every record, and every application that depends on CockroachDB. Enterprise customers trust CockroachDB with their most sensitive data and require SOC2, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS compliance. The distributed architecture adds security complexity — data replicated across regions must be encrypted in transit and at rest with fine-grained access controls.
