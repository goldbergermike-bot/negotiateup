### Distributed Systems Engineer | Cockroach Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5B Valuation) | Distributed SQL Database | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | Deep Systems Engineering

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC HQ | $170K–$235K | $90K–$240K | — | $220K–$360K |
| Remote US | $155K–$220K | $80K–$220K | — | $210K–$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Cockroach Labs' signature engineering role. Distributed Systems Engineers build CockroachDB — a distributed SQL database that provides global scale, strong consistency, and automatic failover. Cockroach Labs is private ($5B valuation) and headquartered in NYC. CockroachDB solves one of the hardest problems in computer science: distributed consensus with serializable isolation at global scale. This role attracts the deepest systems engineers in the industry — people who understand Raft consensus, multi-version concurrency control, distributed transaction protocols, and geo-distributed data replication. The engineering bar is exceptionally high. [Source: Cockroach Labs Distributed Systems Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs Distributed Systems Eng (Senior) = Google L4 (Spanner) = MongoDB Senior SWE = PlanetScale Senior SWE

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Distributed Systems Engineer works across CockroachDB's core architecture:
- **Raft Consensus Layer:** Distributed consensus protocol for strongly-consistent replicated data
- **SQL Execution Engine:** Cost-based query optimizer and distributed SQL execution
- **Transaction Engine:** Serializable isolation with distributed transactions across geo-regions
- **Storage Engine (Pebble):** Custom LSM-tree storage engine built on RocksDB foundations
- **Multi-Region Architecture:** Global data distribution with configurable data residency and locality

**Global Levers**

1. **Hardest Problem in CS:** "CockroachDB solves distributed consensus with serializable isolation at global scale. This is one of the hardest problems in computer science, and the talent pool is extremely small."
2. **Google Spanner Alternative:** "CockroachDB is the open-source alternative to Google Spanner — a system that only Google could build internally. I'm building the version that everyone else can use."
3. **Private Equity Upside:** "Cockroach Labs at $5B with category leadership in distributed SQL has strong IPO potential. The equity needs to be large enough to compensate for illiquidity while capturing upside."
4. **Google Spanner/MongoDB Counter:** Google Spanner engineers earn top-of-market FAANG comp. MongoDB offers liquid RSUs. Frame: "Google is offering L4 comp for Spanner work. CockroachDB is the external Spanner — the equity needs to reflect this."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $350K total comp with equity at $230K over 4 years and acceleration on change of control. Distributed SQL engineering at CockroachDB's level is the hardest systems engineering work outside Google Spanner. I have a Google Spanner offer for reference." Counter at $195K-$220K equity with acceleration is competitive.
