### ML / AI Engineer | Cockroach Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5B Valuation) | Distributed SQL Database (CockroachDB) | **+10–20% AI PREMIUM** | NYC HQ

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC HQ | $170K–$235K | $90K–$245K | — | $230K–$365K |
| Remote US | $155K–$220K | $80K–$225K | — | $210K–$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Cockroach Labs build intelligent database features — automatic index recommendation, query performance prediction, workload-adaptive optimization, and intelligent data placement. These ML features are embedded directly in the database engine, making CockroachDB smarter and more self-managing. This is a unique ML application domain: applying ML to database internals. The intersection of ML expertise and distributed systems knowledge is extremely rare. [Source: Cockroach Labs ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs ML/AI Eng = MongoDB ML Eng = Google L4 ML (Spanner) = AlloyDB ML Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Database-Embedded ML:** "My ML models are embedded in the database engine — automatic indexing, query optimization, and workload management. This is infrastructure-level ML with the highest correctness requirements."
2. **ML + Distributed Systems Intersection:** "The intersection of ML expertise and distributed database knowledge is exceptionally rare. Few engineers have both skill sets."
3. **Self-Managing Database Vision:** "My work makes CockroachDB self-managing — automatically optimizing performance, placing data, and scaling resources. This is the future of databases."
4. **Google/Meta ML Counter:** Both offer $400K+ for ML engineers. Push Cockroach Labs equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $350K total comp with equity at $235K over 4 years. ML + distributed database expertise is the rarest skill intersection in systems engineering." Counter at $200K-$225K equity is competitive.
