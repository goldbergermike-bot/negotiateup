### Technical Program Manager | Cockroach Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5B Valuation) | Distributed SQL Database (CockroachDB) | NYC HQ | High Engineering Bar

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC HQ | $165K–$225K | $80K–$220K | — | $215K–$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**

TPMs at Cockroach Labs coordinate programs for a distributed SQL database — one of the most technically complex software products. Key programs include CockroachDB major version releases, CockroachDB Cloud infrastructure expansions, enterprise security compliance certifications, and performance benchmark campaigns. The technical depth required for database TPM work is higher than typical TPM roles — understanding distributed consensus, query optimization, and storage engine internals is essential for effective program management.

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs Senior TPM = MongoDB Senior TPM = Google L5 TPM = AWS Senior TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Database Release Complexity:** "CockroachDB releases involve coordinating across distributed consensus, SQL execution, storage engine, and cloud service teams. Database release management requires exceptional technical depth."
2. **Zero-Downtime Upgrade Programs:** "Coordinating zero-downtime database upgrades across thousands of customer clusters is uniquely complex program management."
3. **Enterprise Compliance Programs:** If managing SOC2/HIPAA/PCI programs, frame as revenue enabler.
4. **Google/MongoDB TPM Counter:** Both offer competitive TPM comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $210K over 4 years. Database program management requires exceptional technical depth, and I have TPM offers from Google and MongoDB." Counter at $175K-$200K equity is competitive.
