**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Cockroach Labs help enterprise customers design and deploy CockroachDB for mission-critical applications. SAs architect multi-region database topologies, configure data placement policies, optimize query performance, and plan migration strategies from legacy databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle). The SA role requires deep distributed database expertise — understanding Raft consensus, data residency requirements, and distributed SQL performance characteristics.

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs Senior SA = MongoDB SA = Google Cloud SQL SA = AWS Aurora SA

**Global Levers**

1. **Mission-Critical Database Architecture:** "I architect database deployments for mission-critical applications. A poorly designed database topology can cause data loss, consistency violations, or unacceptable latency."
2. **Legacy Migration Expertise:** "I plan and execute migrations from Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL to CockroachDB. Each successful migration is a multi-year enterprise commitment."
3. **Multi-Region Topology Design:** "Designing multi-region CockroachDB topologies with data residency requirements requires deep distributed systems expertise."
4. **MongoDB/Google SA Counter:** Both pay SAs competitively with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $205K over 4 years. I architect mission-critical database deployments where a wrong decision can cause data loss." Counter at $175K-$195K equity is competitive.
