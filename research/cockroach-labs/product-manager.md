**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at Cockroach Labs own the product roadmap for a distributed SQL database used by mission-critical enterprise applications. The PM role requires deep technical understanding of database internals — PMs must understand query optimization, distributed transactions, and multi-region architecture well enough to make product decisions. CockroachDB Cloud (managed service) PM roles drive the company's primary growth vector. [Source: Cockroach Labs PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs PM = MongoDB PM = Google PM (Cloud SQL) = PlanetScale PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Infrastructure Product Expertise:** "Database PM requires deeper technical knowledge than typical PM roles. I must understand distributed consensus, query optimization, and transaction isolation to make product decisions."
2. **Managed Service Revenue:** If owning CockroachDB Cloud, push for premium: "The managed service is the company's primary growth and revenue driver."
3. **Enterprise Database Competition:** "CockroachDB competes with Google Spanner, Amazon Aurora, and MongoDB Atlas. My product decisions determine competitive positioning."
4. **MongoDB/Google PM Counter:** Both offer competitive PM comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $225K over 4 years. Infrastructure PM requires exceptional technical depth, and I'm defining product strategy against Google, Amazon, and MongoDB." Counter at $190K-$215K equity is competitive.
