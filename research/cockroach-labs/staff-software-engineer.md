### Staff Software Engineer | Cockroach Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5B Valuation) | Distributed SQL Database (CockroachDB) | NYC HQ | High Engineering Bar

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC HQ | $220K–$270K | $180K–$380K | — | $340K–$500K |
| Remote US | $205K–$255K | $160K–$350K | — | $315K–$465K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Engineers at Cockroach Labs are among the most technically deep engineers in the industry. They architect the core database engine — distributed consensus, transaction isolation, query optimization, and storage engine internals. At Staff level, you're one of a handful of people in the world who deeply understand distributed SQL database architecture at this level. The talent pool is extraordinarily small (Google Spanner team, CockroachDB, and a few academic researchers). [Source: Cockroach Labs Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs Staff SWE = MongoDB Staff SWE = Google L5 (Spanner) = PlanetScale Staff SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **World-Class Systems Expertise:** "There are perhaps 50-100 people in the world who can architect a distributed SQL database at CockroachDB's level. This scarcity justifies exceptional comp."
2. **Exit Valuation Architecture:** "My architectural decisions directly determine CockroachDB's competitive position and Cockroach Labs' exit valuation."
3. **Advisory-Level Equity Terms:** "At Staff level with exceptional illiquidity risk, I need advisory terms: 1-year exercise window, double-trigger acceleration, and a grant sized for the $5B+ potential."
4. **Google L5 Spanner Counter:** "Google L5 on the Spanner team is my direct comparable. Total comp there is $600K+. Cockroach Labs needs to be within range with equity upside."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $480K total comp with equity at $360K over 4 years, advisory terms, and acceleration. I'm one of a handful of people globally with this depth of distributed SQL expertise." Counter at $310K-$350K equity with acceleration is competitive.
