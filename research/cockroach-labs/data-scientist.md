**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs Senior DS = MongoDB DS = Google L4 DS = PlanetScale DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Database ML Features:** "My ML models are integrated into CockroachDB itself — automatic index recommendations, query performance prediction, and workload optimization. This is product-embedded ML."
2. **Database Performance Modeling:** "Modeling query performance across distributed SQL is a unique and technically deep DS domain."
3. **Product Analytics Impact:** "My product analytics directly influence CockroachDB roadmap decisions and resource allocation."
4. **Google/Meta DS Counter:** Both offer higher DS comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $225K over 4 years. My ML models are embedded in CockroachDB's query optimizer and cluster management — this is product ML at the deepest infrastructure level." Counter at $190K-$215K equity is competitive.
