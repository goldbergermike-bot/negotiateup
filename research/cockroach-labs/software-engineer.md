### Software Engineer | Cockroach Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5B Valuation) | Distributed SQL Database (CockroachDB) | NYC HQ | High Engineering Bar

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC HQ | $155K–$215K | $70K–$220K | — | $195K–$330K |
| Remote US | $145K–$205K | $65K–$200K | — | $185K–$310K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Cockroach Labs is a private distributed SQL database company ($5B valuation) headquartered in NYC. SWEs build CockroachDB — a database that provides serializable isolation, strong consistency, and automatic failover at global scale. The engineering bar is exceptionally high because the product is infrastructure software used by mission-critical applications. Bugs in a database engine can cause data loss or corruption. Compensation is base + equity (no standard bonus). Private equity creates liquidity risk, but the $5B valuation and category leadership provide strong exit potential.

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs SWE = MongoDB SWE = Google L3 = PlanetScale SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Infrastructure Software Premium:** "Database engineering is among the highest-bar software engineering disciplines. Bugs can cause data loss or corruption. The quality standard justifies premium comp."
2. **Private Equity Upside:** "Cockroach Labs at $5B with distributed SQL leadership has strong IPO potential. I need a larger equity grant to compensate for illiquidity."
3. **Google Spanner Alternative:** "CockroachDB is the open-source Google Spanner. The market position is exceptional."
4. **MongoDB/Google Counter:** Both offer liquid equity. Push Cockroach Labs equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $210K over 4 years with acceleration. Database engineering has the highest quality bar in software, and I have offers from MongoDB and Google with liquid equity." Counter at $175K-$200K equity with acceleration is competitive.
