### Data Engineer | Cockroach Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5B Valuation) | Distributed SQL Database (CockroachDB) | NYC HQ | High Engineering Bar

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC HQ | $165K–$225K | $80K–$230K | — | $215K–$345K |
| Remote US | $150K–$210K | $70K–$210K | — | $195K–$320K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Cockroach Labs build the internal data infrastructure that powers product analytics, customer usage telemetry, and business intelligence for CockroachDB. There's a meta-quality: you're a data engineer building data pipelines for a database company. The data engineering standard is inherently higher because your colleagues are the people who built the database. CockroachDB telemetry data (cluster performance, query patterns, resource utilization) helps the product team optimize the database engine. [Source: Cockroach Labs DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs Senior DE = MongoDB DE = Google L4 DE = PlanetScale DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Meta-Database Frame:** "I'm a data engineer at a database company. The standard of data engineering here is inherently higher because my colleagues built the database engine."
2. **Product Telemetry Impact:** "CockroachDB telemetry data I process drives database engine optimization. My data pipelines directly improve the product."
3. **Private Equity Premium:** "I need a 30-40% equity premium for illiquidity risk."
4. **Snowflake/Databricks DE Counter:** Both pay higher with liquid equity for DE roles.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $220K over 4 years. I'm a data engineer at a database company — the standard is inherently higher." Counter at $185K-$210K equity is competitive.
