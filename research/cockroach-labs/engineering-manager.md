### Engineering Manager | Cockroach Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5B Valuation) | Distributed SQL Database (CockroachDB) | NYC HQ | High Engineering Bar

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC HQ | $210K–$260K | $150K–$340K | — | $310K–$460K |
| Remote US | $195K–$245K | $130K–$310K | — | $285K–$425K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Cockroach Labs lead teams building one of the most technically demanding products in software — a distributed SQL database. EMs must be technically strong enough to make architecture decisions alongside Staff ICs, because database engineering does not tolerate weak technical leadership. The talent pool for database engineering management is extremely small — EMs who understand distributed consensus, transaction isolation, and query optimization at this depth are rare.

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs EM = MongoDB EM = Google L5 Manager (Spanner) = PlanetScale EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Technically-Deep EM:** "Database engineering EMs must be technically strong enough to make architecture decisions. I'm not just a people manager — I'm a technical leader for the most demanding systems engineering discipline."
2. **Rare Talent Retention:** "Distributed SQL engineers are among the rarest talent in tech. Retaining my team against Google Spanner and MongoDB recruiting is a core deliverable."
3. **IC Parity:** Staff ICs at Cockroach Labs can earn $350K+ in equity. EMs must match or exceed.
4. **Google/MongoDB EM Counter:** Both offer competitive EM comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $325K over 4 years with acceleration. I'm leading teams building the most technically demanding product in software, and I need comp exceeding my Staff ICs." Counter at $280K-$310K equity with acceleration is competitive.
