**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Cockroach Labs manage the infrastructure for CockroachDB Cloud — the managed database service. Running a managed distributed SQL database at scale is among the most complex infrastructure challenges in tech. Each CockroachDB cluster must maintain strong consistency, automatic failover, and zero data loss across availability zones and regions. Infrastructure reliability is existentially important — database downtime means customer data inaccessibility. [Source: Cockroach Labs DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

2. **Meta-Infrastructure Frame:** "I'm managing infrastructure for a database company. My infrastructure reliability directly determines whether customers trust their most critical data to CockroachDB."
3. **Zero Data Loss Mandate:** "Database infrastructure has a zero data loss mandate. There is no acceptable failure mode — the reliability standard is absolute."
4. **MongoDB Cloud/Google Counter:** Both offer competitive infrastructure comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $215K over 4 years with acceleration. Managing distributed database infrastructure with a zero data loss mandate is the highest-bar infrastructure work." Counter at $180K-$205K equity is competitive.
