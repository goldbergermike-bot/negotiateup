### DevOps Engineer | Cockroach Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5B Valuation) | Distributed SQL Database (CockroachDB) | NYC HQ | High Engineering Bar

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC HQ | $160K–$225K | $80K–$225K | — | $210K–$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Cockroach Labs manage the infrastructure for CockroachDB Cloud — the managed database service. Running a managed distributed SQL database at scale is among the most complex infrastructure challenges in tech. Each CockroachDB cluster must maintain strong consistency, automatic failover, and zero data loss across availability zones and regions. Infrastructure reliability is existentially important — database downtime means customer data inaccessibility. [Source: Cockroach Labs DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cockroach Labs Senior DevOps = MongoDB Cloud SRE = Google L4 SRE = PlanetScale DevOps

**Global Levers**

1. **Managed Database Infrastructure:** "Running a managed distributed SQL database is among the hardest infrastructure challenges. Each cluster must maintain strong consistency, automatic failover, and zero data loss."
2. **Meta-Infrastructure Frame:** "I'm managing infrastructure for a database company. My infrastructure reliability directly determines whether customers trust their most critical data to CockroachDB."
3. **Zero Data Loss Mandate:** "Database infrastructure has a zero data loss mandate. There is no acceptable failure mode — the reliability standard is absolute."
4. **MongoDB Cloud/Google Counter:** Both offer competitive infrastructure comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $215K over 4 years with acceleration. Managing distributed database infrastructure with a zero data loss mandate is the highest-bar infrastructure work." Counter at $180K-$205K equity is competitive.
