**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Samsung shape the experience for one of the world's most widely-used design systems: One UI, which runs on over 1 billion Galaxy smartphones, tablets, wearables, and TVs. Samsung's design organization spans the Corporate Design Center in Seoul (responsible for Samsung's global design language), US UX teams (focused on Galaxy AI interactions, Samsung Health, and SmartThings), and regional studios. The US design team operates with significant creative autonomy, making it an attractive destination for Silicon Valley designers who want scale impact.

Samsung's design compensation in the US has historically trailed Apple and Google by 15-25%, but the Galaxy AI initiative has created a new premium tier for designers who can craft AI-native interaction patterns. Designers with experience in conversational UI, generative AI interfaces, or multimodal interaction design are particularly valued. Samsung has also increased RSU grants for design roles since 2023, recognizing that retaining design talent is critical to the One UI experience.

**The Cross-Device Design System Premium**

Samsung's design challenge is uniquely complex: One UI must work seamlessly across foldable phones, standard smartphones, tablets, watches, TVs, and IoT appliances. Designers who can create cohesive experiences across this device spectrum are rare. The addition of Galaxy AI interactions (on-device translation overlays, generative image editing, AI-powered search) adds another layer of complexity that few design teams face.

**Global Levers**

1. **Apple/Google Design Offer:** "I have an offer from [Apple/Google] design at $[X] TC. Samsung's cross-device design challenges are compelling, but I need the compensation to reflect the market."
2. **AI UX Expertise:** "My experience designing [conversational AI/generative AI/multimodal] interfaces is directly applicable to Galaxy AI. This expertise commands $[X] at competitors."
3. **Scale Impact:** "My design decisions would impact 1B+ daily active users across the Galaxy ecosystem. This scale of impact justifies $[target TC]."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A sign-on of $[25K-45K] would make the transition from [current company] financially sound."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Designing Galaxy AI experiences for 1B+ users is a rare opportunity. I have a competing offer from [Apple/Google] at $[W]K TC. To accept Samsung, I need RSUs at $[Y+40K] and a $35K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
