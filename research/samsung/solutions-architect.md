**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Samsung work across the company's expanding enterprise portfolio: Samsung Knox (mobile device management for enterprises and governments), SmartThings Business (commercial IoT solutions), Samsung SDS (IT services and consulting), and Samsung's semiconductor/display B2B customer engagements. The role combines deep technical expertise with customer-facing consultative skills, designing architectures that integrate Samsung's hardware and software products into enterprise environments.

US-based Solutions Architects typically focus on Knox enterprise deployments (one of Samsung's fastest-growing enterprise revenue streams), carrier partnerships (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile), or semiconductor customer engagements. Compensation includes base salary, equity, and in some cases sales-adjacent bonuses tied to deal outcomes. Samsung has been expanding its SA function to compete with enterprise-focused companies like Microsoft, Google Cloud, and VMware.

**Level Mapping:** Solutions Architect at Samsung (CL3-CL4) = L5-L6 at Google Cloud SA, equivalent AWS SA, Principal SA at Microsoft, SA at VMware

**The Enterprise Revenue Premium**

Samsung's enterprise revenue (Knox, Samsung SDS, B2B displays, semiconductor custom solutions) is a high-growth segment. Solutions Architects directly influence deal sizes and customer retention, creating a clear revenue attribution that supports above-band compensation. Candidates with enterprise architecture experience, particularly in mobile device management, IoT, or semiconductor customer engagement, have strong negotiation leverage.
