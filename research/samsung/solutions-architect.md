**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Samsung work across the company's expanding enterprise portfolio: Samsung Knox (mobile device management for enterprises and governments), SmartThings Business (commercial IoT solutions), Samsung SDS (IT services and consulting), and Samsung's semiconductor/display B2B customer engagements. The role combines deep technical expertise with customer-facing consultative skills, designing architectures that integrate Samsung's hardware and software products into enterprise environments.

US-based Solutions Architects typically focus on Knox enterprise deployments (one of Samsung's fastest-growing enterprise revenue streams), carrier partnerships (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile), or semiconductor customer engagements. Compensation includes base salary, equity, and in some cases sales-adjacent bonuses tied to deal outcomes. Samsung has been expanding its SA function to compete with enterprise-focused companies like Microsoft, Google Cloud, and VMware.

**The Enterprise Revenue Premium**

Samsung's enterprise revenue (Knox, Samsung SDS, B2B displays, semiconductor custom solutions) is a high-growth segment. Solutions Architects directly influence deal sizes and customer retention, creating a clear revenue attribution that supports above-band compensation. Candidates with enterprise architecture experience, particularly in mobile device management, IoT, or semiconductor customer engagement, have strong negotiation leverage.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cloud/Enterprise SA Offer:** "I have an SA offer from [AWS/Google Cloud/Microsoft] at $[X] TC. Samsung's hardware+software integration for enterprises is differentiated, but I need comp that matches cloud provider SA rates."
2. **Deal Revenue Impact:** "As an SA, I directly influence $[X]M+ in enterprise deal pipeline. My compensation should reflect this revenue responsibility."
3. **Knox Enterprise Expertise:** "My [MDM/enterprise mobility/government security] background directly enables Knox enterprise sales. This expertise commands $[X] at competitors like VMware and Microsoft."
4. **Carrier/Partner Relationships:** "My existing relationships with [carriers/enterprise customers] accelerate Samsung's B2B growth and justify premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Samsung's enterprise portfolio -- especially Knox -- is growing rapidly. I have a competing SA offer from [AWS/Google Cloud] at $[W]K TC. To choose Samsung, I need RSUs at $[Y+55K] and a $45K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
