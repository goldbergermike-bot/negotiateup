**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Samsung defend one of the world's most complex attack surfaces: 1B+ smartphones running Samsung Knox, Samsung Pay processing billions in transactions, SmartThings controlling millions of IoT devices, and semiconductor fabrication facilities requiring industrial security. Samsung Knox is the company's enterprise security platform, trusted by governments and Fortune 500 companies -- making security engineering a revenue-generating function, not just a cost center.

Samsung's US security team focuses on mobile platform security (Knox, TrustZone, Secure Enclave), application security (Galaxy Store, Samsung Pay), cloud security (SmartThings Cloud, Samsung Account), and increasingly AI security (protecting Galaxy AI models from adversarial attacks and ensuring data privacy for on-device inference). The company maintains a dedicated security research team (Samsung SRID) that discovers and patches vulnerabilities across the ecosystem.

Compensation for security engineers has increased faster than general SWE roles at Samsung, driven by the acute global shortage of security talent and the regulatory/compliance requirements of Samsung's enterprise and financial products. Candidates with experience in mobile security, hardware security modules, or AI/ML security are particularly well-positioned to negotiate above standard bands.

**Level Mapping:** Security Engineer at Samsung (CL2-CL3) = L4-L5 at Google (Security), IC4-IC5 at Meta, Security Engineer at Apple, SDE-Security at Amazon

**The Knox Enterprise Revenue Premium**

Samsung Knox generates significant enterprise revenue through mobile device management, secure workspace solutions, and government certifications. Security engineers directly impact this revenue stream by maintaining Knox's security certifications (Common Criteria, FIPS, DoD approval) and developing new security features. This revenue attribution gives hiring managers justification for above-band offers.

**Global Levers**

1. **Security Firm Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto/Google Security] at $[X] TC. Samsung's mobile security challenges at Knox scale are unique, but I need comp that reflects the security talent shortage."
2. **Knox Revenue Impact:** "Knox enterprise security is a direct revenue driver for Samsung. My [mobile security/HSM/TrustZone] expertise protects and grows this revenue stream."
3. **Regulatory Expertise:** "My experience with [FIPS/Common Criteria/government security certifications] directly enables Samsung's enterprise sales. This compliance expertise is rare and valuable."
4. **AI Security Scarcity:** "Galaxy AI security (model protection, data privacy, adversarial defense) is a new frontier. My experience at this intersection of AI and security is extremely scarce."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Samsung's security challenges across Knox, Galaxy AI, and 1B+ devices are compelling. I have a competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Google Security] at $[W]K TC. To choose Samsung, I need RSUs at $[Y+55K] and a $45K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
