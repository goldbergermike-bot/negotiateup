**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Samsung are at the forefront of the company's most strategic initiative: bringing competitive AI capabilities to the world's largest smartphone ecosystem. Samsung's AI efforts span on-device models for Galaxy AI (real-time translation, generative photo editing, intelligent summarization), Bixby voice AI, Samsung Health predictive analytics, and Samsung Research's foundational AI research. The company operates AI research centers in Mountain View, Montreal, Cambridge (UK), Moscow, and Seoul.

Samsung competes directly with Apple (Apple Intelligence), Google (Gemini Nano), and Qualcomm (AI Engine) for ML engineers who specialize in on-device inference. This competition has driven Samsung to create a distinct AI compensation tier that approaches FAANG levels -- particularly for engineers with experience in model compression, quantization, neural architecture search, and NPU optimization. Samsung's unique advantage is the ability to co-optimize models with custom Exynos silicon, requiring engineers who understand both ML algorithms and hardware constraints.

**Level Mapping:** ML/AI Engineer at Samsung (CL3-CL4) = L4-L5 at Google Brain/DeepMind, IC4-IC5 at Meta FAIR, ML Engineer at Apple ML, Research Engineer at OpenAI/Anthropic

**The Hardware-AI Co-Design Premium**

Samsung's ability to vertically integrate AI models with custom silicon (Exynos NPU, custom ISP for computational photography) is a differentiator that few companies can match. ML engineers who can optimize models for specific hardware architectures are extraordinarily scarce. Samsung recognizes this and offers above-standard-band compensation for candidates with hardware-aware ML experience.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Lab Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google AI/Apple ML/Anthropic] at $[X] TC. Samsung's hardware-AI integration is unique, but the compensation gap is $[Y]."
2. **On-Device AI Scarcity:** "Engineers with [model compression/NPU optimization/on-device inference] experience are in extreme demand. This skillset commands $[X] at Apple and Google."
3. **Galaxy AI Revenue Impact:** "Galaxy AI directly impacts Samsung's premium device ASP and market share. My work would influence the competitive positioning of 200M+ annual smartphone sales."
4. **Research Publication Value:** "My publication record in [NeurIPS/ICML/CVPR] demonstrates expertise that Samsung Research values for both product and research credibility."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Galaxy AI's hardware-software integration is genuinely exciting. I have a competing offer from [Apple ML/Google] at $[W]K TC. To choose Samsung, I need RSUs increased to $[Y+70K] and a $50K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
