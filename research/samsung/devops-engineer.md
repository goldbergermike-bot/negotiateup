**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Samsung are central to the company's infrastructure modernization effort. Samsung operates one of the most complex technology infrastructures in the world: consumer-facing services (Galaxy Store, Samsung Account, SmartThings Cloud, Samsung Health) serving over a billion users, semiconductor fabrication systems requiring ultra-high reliability, and internal development platforms supporting 50,000+ engineers globally. The transition from traditional on-premises infrastructure to cloud-native architectures on AWS, GCP, and Azure creates massive demand for DevOps expertise.

Samsung's US DevOps engineers typically work on CI/CD pipelines for mobile software releases (One UI ships updates to 1B+ devices), cloud infrastructure for Samsung's consumer services, or platform engineering for internal developer tools. The company has adopted Kubernetes, Terraform, and modern observability stacks (Datadog, Grafana) but still has significant legacy infrastructure, creating opportunities for engineers who can drive modernization. Compensation has improved to be competitive with mid-tier tech companies, though it typically trails FAANG by 10-20%.

**Level Mapping:** DevOps Engineer at Samsung (CL2-CL3) = L3-L4 at Google (SRE), IC3-IC4 at Meta (Production Engineer), SDE II-Senior at Amazon

**The Infrastructure Modernization Premium**

Samsung's shift from hardware-first to software-defined products creates urgent demand for DevOps engineers who can build and scale cloud-native infrastructure. The company is actively migrating consumer services from proprietary data centers to public cloud, a multi-year initiative that requires experienced platform engineers. Candidates with Kubernetes, infrastructure-as-code, and multi-cloud expertise have strong leverage.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cloud/SRE Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google SRE/Amazon/Datadog] at $[X] TC. Samsung's infrastructure modernization is a compelling challenge, but I'd need the equity increased to $[target]."
2. **Scale Impact:** "Samsung's services handle 1B+ device connections. My [Kubernetes/cloud migration/observability] experience directly reduces downtime risk for this massive user base."
3. **Modernization Expertise:** "My cloud-native infrastructure experience is exactly what Samsung needs for its modernization initiative. This skillset commands $[X] at cloud-native companies."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A sign-on of $[30K-50K] offsets my unvested equity and reflects Samsung's need for experienced DevOps talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Samsung's infrastructure modernization at the scale of 1B+ devices is a rare opportunity. I have a competing offer from [Google SRE/Amazon] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I'd need RSUs increased to $[Y+50K] and a $40K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
