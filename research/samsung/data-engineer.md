### Data Engineer | Samsung Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $350B conglomerate generating massive IoT/device telemetry data + Galaxy ecosystem analytics powering AI features + Korean HQ with competitive US R&D offices | Samsung's data infrastructure supports 1B+ connected devices globally | **DATA SCALE PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Bay Area / San Jose (US R&D) | $140K–$195K | $45K–$140K | 15–25% | $185K–$300K |
| Austin / Dallas (US) | $130K–$180K | $40K–$120K | 15–25% | $170K–$275K |
| Seoul (HQ) | KRW 58M–KRW 100M | KRW 18M–KRW 55M | 20–50% (OPI+TAI) | KRW 80M–KRW 160M |
| Suwon (R&D Campus) | KRW 55M–KRW 95M | KRW 15M–KRW 50M | 20–50% | KRW 75M–KRW 150M |
| Bangalore | INR 22L–INR 45L | INR 8L–INR 25L | 15–20% | INR 30L–INR 55L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Samsung's data engineering needs are driven by one of the world's largest device ecosystems. With over 1 billion active Galaxy smartphones, SmartThings-connected appliances, Galaxy Watches, and Samsung TVs generating continuous telemetry, Samsung processes petabytes of data daily. Data Engineers at Samsung build the pipelines, warehouses, and real-time analytics systems that power Galaxy AI features, ad targeting for Samsung Ads, supply chain optimization for semiconductor manufacturing, and quality analytics for display production.

Data Engineers at Samsung US R&D typically work on Galaxy ecosystem analytics, Samsung Ads data platform, or SmartThings IoT data infrastructure. The role maps to CL2-CL3 for mid-career and CL3-CL4 for senior data engineers. Samsung has invested heavily in modernizing its data stack, migrating from legacy Hadoop systems to cloud-native architectures on AWS/GCP, creating strong demand for engineers with modern data platform experience (Spark, Flink, dbt, Snowflake, BigQuery).

Compensation for data engineers at Samsung US offices has improved significantly since 2023, with RSU grants expanding and bonuses becoming more predictable. The key leverage point is Samsung's competition with tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Snowflake for data engineering talent -- Samsung recruiters are authorized to increase packages when candidates present credible competing offers from data-focused companies.

**The Device Ecosystem Data Premium**

Samsung's unique advantage is the sheer volume and variety of device data it collects across consumer electronics, mobile, semiconductor manufacturing, and IoT. Few companies in the world operate data pipelines at this intersection of hardware telemetry and consumer behavior. Data engineers who can build pipelines spanning these domains have scarcity value. The Galaxy AI initiative has further amplified demand: on-device AI features require massive training data pipelines, creating new roles that blend traditional data engineering with ML infrastructure.

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Platform Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Snowflake/Databricks/Amazon] at $[X] total comp. Samsung's device data scale is unmatched, but I need the equity increased to $[target] to close the gap."
2. **IoT Data Scarcity:** "My experience with [IoT telemetry/real-time streaming/petabyte-scale pipelines] directly applies to Samsung's SmartThings and Galaxy data infrastructure. This expertise commands $[X] at competitors."
3. **Galaxy AI Data Impact:** "Galaxy AI features depend on the data pipelines I'd be building. Given the strategic importance of AI to Samsung's mobile business, I'd like comp that reflects this -- specifically $[target TC]."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested equity. A sign-on of $[30K-60K] would make the transition work financially."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. I'm excited about Samsung's data scale across 1B+ devices. I have a competing offer from [Snowflake/Amazon] at $[W]K TC. To choose Samsung, I'd need RSUs increased to $[Y+50K] and a $40K sign-on, bringing first-year comp to $[target]."
