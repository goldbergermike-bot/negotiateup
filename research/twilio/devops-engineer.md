**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps engineers at Twilio ensure the reliability, scalability, and performance of infrastructure serving billions of API calls daily across messaging, voice, and video channels. In February 2026, the DevOps function is critical to CustomerAI's success—deploying and managing the ML infrastructure, model serving systems, and data pipelines that power AI-driven communications at scale.

Twilio's DevOps compensation reflects the extreme reliability requirements of a communications platform where downtime directly impacts customer revenue. The company maintains five-nines availability targets, and DevOps engineers are the frontline of this commitment. With CustomerAI adding ML model serving infrastructure, GPU clusters, and real-time data pipelines to the operational footprint, DevOps complexity and compensation have increased significantly.

Candidates with experience managing ML/AI infrastructure alongside traditional cloud platforms command premium packages. The ability to automate deployment pipelines for both microservices and ML models, combined with deep Kubernetes and cloud-native expertise, positions candidates strongly in Twilio's February 2026 hiring market.

### 🏗️ Twilio CustomerAI Infrastructure Operations Lever
CustomerAI's February 2026 deployment requires DevOps engineers who can build and manage the infrastructure for AI model serving at communications scale. This includes GPU cluster orchestration for model training, low-latency inference serving infrastructure, and the CI/CD pipelines that enable rapid model iteration while maintaining platform stability. DevOps engineers must ensure CustomerAI infrastructure achieves the same reliability standards as Twilio's core communications platform.

The operational challenge extends beyond traditional DevOps. CustomerAI introduces new infrastructure patterns—model canary deployments, A/B testing infrastructure, feature store management, and GPU resource optimization—that require DevOps engineers to expand their toolkit significantly. Engineers who bridge traditional cloud operations and ML infrastructure operations are exceptionally valuable to Twilio's CustomerAI initiative.

**Global Levers**
1. **Communications-Scale Reliability:** "I've managed infrastructure serving billions of requests daily with five-nines availability. Twilio's reliability requirements for CustomerAI map directly to my experience maintaining mission-critical systems."
2. **ML Infrastructure Operations:** "I've built and managed GPU clusters and model serving infrastructure in production. This ML ops expertise is essential for CustomerAI's deployment and scaling needs."
3. **Kubernetes & Cloud-Native Mastery:** "My deep expertise in Kubernetes orchestration, including GPU workload scheduling and multi-region deployments, directly addresses CustomerAI's infrastructure complexity."
4. **Automation & Efficiency:** "I've reduced infrastructure costs by 30%+ through automation and optimization while improving reliability. This efficiency mindset is critical as CustomerAI scales infrastructure spend."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the DevOps challenge of bringing CustomerAI to production at Twilio's scale. My competing offer is $195K base with $210K RSUs from a cloud infrastructure company. To accept Twilio's offer, I'd need the base at $195K and RSUs at $210K. At $290K total comp, I can start immediately and bring my ML infrastructure operations expertise to the team."
