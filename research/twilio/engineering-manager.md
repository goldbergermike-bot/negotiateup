### Engineering Manager | Twilio Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** People leadership premium with equity upside | CustomerAI team scaling in 2026

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco, CA (HQ) | $195K–$260K | $200K–$400K | 15–20% | $300K–$440K |
| Denver, CO | $175K–$240K | $170K–$350K | 15–20% | $270K–$400K |
| London, UK | £120K–£170K | £120K–£260K | 15–20% | £190K–£310K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering managers at Twilio lead teams of 6–12 engineers building the communications APIs and CustomerAI systems that power millions of businesses. In February 2026, EMs are critical to Twilio's ability to scale its CustomerAI engineering organization while maintaining the platform reliability that enterprise customers demand. The role requires balancing rapid feature delivery with technical debt management and team health.

Twilio's EM compensation reflects the company's understanding that strong engineering management directly impacts retention, velocity, and quality. Following the 2023 restructuring, Twilio invested heavily in management quality, raising EM compensation to competitive levels and introducing leadership-specific equity refresh programs. EMs who can demonstrate both people leadership and technical depth command the strongest packages.

The February 2026 context creates particular leverage for EM candidates. Twilio is simultaneously scaling multiple CustomerAI teams, integrating Segment engineering workflows, and building new AI/ML platform capabilities. EMs who can hire, develop, and retain talent in this competitive market while delivering on aggressive product timelines are exceptionally valuable to the organization.

### 🏗️ Twilio CustomerAI Team Scaling Lever
Twilio's CustomerAI initiative requires building entirely new engineering teams in February 2026—teams focused on ML infrastructure, AI model serving, customer data integration, and intelligent communications orchestration. Engineering managers who can recruit top talent, establish team cultures, and deliver on the CustomerAI roadmap are among the most sought-after hires in Twilio's engineering organization.

The management challenge is compounded by the cross-functional nature of CustomerAI. EMs must coordinate with Segment's data engineering teams, Twilio's existing messaging platform teams, and new AI/ML specialists. This requires managers who can bridge technical domains, resolve competing priorities, and maintain team cohesion during a period of rapid organizational change. Candidates with experience managing teams through platform transitions or AI/ML adoption hold significant negotiation leverage.

**Global Levers**
1. **Team Building Track Record:** "I've built and scaled engineering teams from 4 to 20+ engineers in high-growth environments. Twilio's CustomerAI scaling needs exactly this capability, and my retention record of 95%+ demonstrates I can keep top talent engaged."
2. **Cross-Functional Leadership:** "Managing at the intersection of data, AI, and communications platforms requires a unique management skillset. My experience leading cross-functional engineering teams maps directly to CustomerAI's organizational complexity."
3. **Hiring Market Expertise:** "In the current AI talent market, effective engineering management is a competitive advantage for recruiting. I bring both a strong network and proven recruiting practices that will accelerate CustomerAI team growth."
4. **Delivery Under Transformation:** "I've managed engineering teams through major platform transitions, delivering on time while maintaining team health. This experience is directly relevant to Twilio's CustomerAI transformation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm energized by the opportunity to build and lead CustomerAI engineering teams at Twilio. My competing offer is $250K base with $380K RSUs as an EM at a comparable platform company. I'd need Twilio to match at $255K base and $380K RSUs to accept. At $435K total comp, I'm ready to commit and bring my team-building expertise to CustomerAI immediately."
