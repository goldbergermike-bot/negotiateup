**Negotiation DNA:** Cross-platform program execution premium | CustomerAI launch coordination driving 2026 milestones

|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco, CA (HQ) | $155K–$210K | $110K–$230K | 10–15% | $215K–$320K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Technical program managers at Twilio orchestrate complex, cross-functional programs that span the company's communications and data platform divisions. In February 2026, TPMs are the connective tissue making CustomerAI possible—coordinating engineering, product, design, and go-to-market teams across Twilio and Segment to deliver integrated AI-powered communications features on aggressive timelines.

Twilio's TPM compensation reflects the organizational leverage these roles provide. With CustomerAI requiring coordination across multiple engineering teams, geographies, and product lines, TPMs who can drive alignment and execution at this scale directly impact the company's ability to deliver its most important strategic initiative. The role demands both deep technical understanding and exceptional program management capabilities.

Candidates with experience managing large-scale platform programs, particularly those involving AI/ML system deployments or multi-product integrations, hold significant leverage. The complexity of coordinating CustomerAI's cross-platform dependencies—from Segment data pipeline readiness to ML model deployment to API surface changes—requires experienced TPMs who can manage technical risk while maintaining delivery velocity.

### 🏗️ Twilio CustomerAI Program Execution Lever
The CustomerAI launch program in February 2026 is one of the most complex cross-functional initiatives in Twilio's history. TPMs must coordinate dependencies across Segment's data engineering teams, Twilio's messaging and voice platform teams, new AI/ML infrastructure teams, and the enterprise go-to-market organization. Each dependency carries technical risk, and the TPM's ability to identify, track, and mitigate these risks directly determines CustomerAI's time-to-market.

TPMs on CustomerAI also manage the integration of engineering workflows between historically separate Twilio and Segment engineering organizations. This organizational complexity—different development cultures, tools, and release processes—adds a human dimension to program management that goes beyond traditional technical coordination. TPMs who can bridge these cultural gaps while maintaining technical rigor are essential to CustomerAI's success.

**Global Levers**
1. **Cross-Platform Program Experience:** "I've managed programs spanning multiple product lines with 50+ engineers. CustomerAI's cross-platform coordination requirements map directly to my experience delivering complex, multi-team initiatives."
2. **AI/ML Launch Programs:** "I've led the program management for AI feature launches from model development through production deployment. This end-to-end AI program experience is directly relevant to CustomerAI's delivery needs."
3. **Post-Acquisition Integration:** "My experience integrating engineering organizations post-acquisition—aligning tools, processes, and cultures—is valuable for the ongoing Twilio-Segment engineering integration."
4. **Risk Management at Scale:** "I've managed program risk for initiatives with $100M+ revenue impact. My structured approach to dependency tracking and risk mitigation will protect CustomerAI's delivery timeline."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm energized by the program management challenge of delivering CustomerAI across Twilio's platform. My competing offer from a major tech company is $205K base with $220K RSUs as a TPM. To choose Twilio, I'd need the base at $205K and RSUs at $220K. At $315K total comp, I can commit to driving CustomerAI's launch program immediately."
