### Staff Software Engineer | Cruise Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** GM Subsidiary Comp | Competitive Bay Area RSUs | Autonomous Vehicle Pioneer | San Francisco Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco (HQ) | $200K-$260K | $250K-$550K | 10-15% | $360K-$560K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Cruise define the technical strategy for major areas of the autonomous driving platform. At this level, you influence the direction of multiple teams and make architectural decisions that shape Cruise's competitive position. Staff-level AV talent is extraordinarily scarce — there are perhaps a few hundred engineers globally with both the autonomy domain expertise and the technical leadership ability required. Cruise must compete with Waymo (GOOGL equity), Google (L5), and Meta (E5) for this talent, and the equity grants reflect this competition. Your decisions on perception architecture, planning algorithms, simulation infrastructure, or fleet operations systems directly determine the capability and safety of Cruise's autonomous vehicles.

**Level Mapping:** Cruise Staff Software Engineer = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Waymo Staff SWE = Apple ICT4 = Amazon Principal SDE

**Global Levers**

1. **AV Staff Talent Scarcity:** "Staff-level autonomous driving engineers are extraordinarily rare. I bring [X years] of AV experience with a track record of [specific technical leadership]. This scarcity commands premium compensation."
2. **Technical Strategy Ownership:** "I'll define the technical direction for [perception/planning/simulation/infrastructure]. My architectural decisions will shape Cruise's competitive position for years."
3. **Waymo/Google L5 Parity:** "My alternative is a Waymo Staff or Google L5 role at $[X] with GOOGL equity. Cruise's equity needs to be competitive on a risk-adjusted basis."
4. **Retention-Grade Grant:** "Staff engineers are the highest-value retention targets. I need $450K+ in RSUs over 4 years — a grant that reflects the cost of replacing Staff-level AV expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "At Staff level, I'll define Cruise's technical direction in [specific area]. I'm targeting $480K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $250K. I have a Google L5 offer at $[X] and a Waymo Staff offer at $[Y]. Cruise's mission is compelling, but the equity must be competitive with these alternatives." Accept at $400K+ RSUs with base above $235K.
