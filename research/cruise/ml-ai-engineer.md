### ML/AI Engineer | Cruise Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** GM Subsidiary Comp | Competitive Bay Area RSUs | **+5-15% ML PREMIUM** | Autonomous Vehicle Pioneer | San Francisco Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco (HQ) | $170K-$235K | $130K-$350K | 10-15% | $250K-$420K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Cruise ML/AI Engineers build the perception, prediction, and behavior models that enable autonomous vehicles to understand and navigate San Francisco's complex urban environment. Your models must detect pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles, and obstacles in real-time with near-perfect accuracy — across fog, rain, night conditions, and dense urban traffic. Cruise's ML challenges are particularly demanding because San Francisco is one of the most complex driving environments in the world (hills, double-parked cars, cyclists, jaywalkers, construction). The 5-15% ML premium reflects the scarcity of ML engineers who can build production-grade, safety-critical perception and prediction models. [Source: Cruise ML Engineering Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cruise ML/AI Engineer = Google ML Engineer L4-L5 = Waymo ML Engineer = Meta ML Engineer (IC4-IC5) = Tesla ML Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **Safety-Critical ML Premium:** "My perception and prediction models must work with near-perfect accuracy in San Francisco's complex urban environment. Failure modes have physical-world safety consequences. This safety-critical ML work commands a 5-15% premium."
2. **Urban Complexity Challenge:** "San Francisco is one of the most challenging driving environments for autonomous vehicles. My models must handle fog, hills, double-parked cars, cyclists, and jaywalkers — significantly harder than suburban or highway driving."
3. **ML Talent Competition:** "ML engineers in San Francisco have offers from Google Brain, Waymo, Meta FAIR, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Cruise needs to compete on total comp for ML talent."
4. **Production ML at Scale:** "My models run in real-time on autonomous vehicles in production. This production-grade, real-time ML for safety-critical systems is a specialized capability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Cruise's ML challenges in San Francisco's complex urban environment are uniquely demanding. I'm targeting $310K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $225K. I have a [Google Brain/Waymo/OpenAI] ML offer at $[X]. Cruise's applied ML challenges are compelling, but comp needs to reflect ML market rates." Accept at $270K+ RSUs with base above $210K.
