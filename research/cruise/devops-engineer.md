### DevOps Engineer | Cruise Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** GM Subsidiary Comp | Competitive Bay Area RSUs | Autonomous Vehicle Pioneer | San Francisco Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco (HQ) | $150K-$208K | $90K-$275K | 10-15% | $208K-$345K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Cruise DevOps Engineers build and maintain the infrastructure that supports autonomous vehicle development, simulation, fleet operations, and deployment. Your infrastructure processes massive simulation workloads (millions of scenarios), manages a fleet of autonomous vehicles in real-time, and deploys safety-critical software updates. Cruise's infrastructure must meet automotive-grade reliability while operating at cloud scale. DevOps at Cruise spans GPU compute clusters for ML training, real-time fleet management systems, CI/CD pipelines for vehicle software, and simulation infrastructure. Competitive Bay Area comp.

**Level Mapping:** Cruise DevOps Engineer = Google SRE L3-L4 = Waymo DevOps = Amazon Systems Engineer = Meta Production Engineer (IC3-IC4)

**Global Levers**

1. **AV Infrastructure Criticality:** "Cruise's infrastructure supports autonomous vehicles on public roads. Infrastructure reliability has physical-world safety implications that exceed standard cloud operations."
2. **Simulation + Fleet Infrastructure:** "I manage infrastructure across two demanding domains — GPU-heavy simulation clusters and real-time fleet operations. This dual-domain complexity is unique to AV companies."
3. **Bay Area DevOps Market:** "DevOps/SRE engineers in San Francisco have strong alternatives. Cruise needs to match Google SRE and Waymo compensation to compete."
4. **Sign-On Bonus:** "I'm requesting a $15K-$25K sign-on bonus to bridge first-year equity uncertainty."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Cruise's infrastructure challenges span simulation, fleet operations, and vehicle deployment. I'm targeting $240K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $200K. I have a Google SRE offer at $[X]." Accept at $210K+ RSUs with base above $190K.
