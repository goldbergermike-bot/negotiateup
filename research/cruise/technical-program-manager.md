**Negotiation DNA**

Cruise Technical Program Managers coordinate complex programs across the autonomous driving stack — perception, prediction, planning, simulation, fleet operations, and safety validation. Cruise TPMs manage programs where a single feature release requires coordination across ML training, simulation validation, safety review, regulatory approval, and fleet deployment. The complexity of AV programs exceeds typical software program management — you're coordinating hardware, software, ML, safety, and regulatory workstreams simultaneously. Competitive Bay Area comp.

**Level Mapping:** Cruise TPM = Google TPM L4-L5 = Waymo TPM = Amazon TPM = Meta TPM (IC4-IC5)

**Global Levers**

1. **AV Program Complexity:** "Cruise programs span ML, simulation, vehicle software, fleet operations, and regulatory approval. This cross-domain coordination exceeds typical software TPM roles."
2. **Safety-Critical Release Management:** "Every release goes through safety validation across billions of simulation scenarios. I manage programs where the release process is a safety gate for public roads."
3. **Bay Area TPM Market:** "TPMs in San Francisco have offers from Google, Waymo, Meta, and top startups. Cruise needs to be competitive."
4. **Regulatory Timeline Impact:** "My program management directly impacts regulatory milestones. Program delays affect Cruise's operating permits and expansion."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Cruise's program complexity spans ML, simulation, safety validation, and fleet deployment. I'm targeting $260K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $205K. I have a Google TPM offer at $[X]." Accept at $225K+ RSUs with base above $195K.
