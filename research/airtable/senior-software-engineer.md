**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Airtable own major subsystems of the platform — the relational data engine, real-time collaboration framework, automation pipeline, API platform, or enterprise governance layer. This is a uniquely challenging product engineering role: you're building a system that must feel as simple as a spreadsheet while performing like an enterprise database, supporting real-time collaboration across thousands of users while maintaining ACID consistency on complex relational data. Senior engineers at Airtable are expected to drive technical design decisions and mentor more junior engineers in a relatively lean engineering organization, which means high impact per engineer. The pre-IPO equity at the senior level is substantial, though valuation uncertainty from the $11B peak should be factored into negotiation.

### 🏗️ Enterprise Scale & AI Platform Lever
Airtable's 2026 enterprise strategy depends on senior engineers solving the hardest scaling challenges — supporting million-row bases, complex automations at enterprise scale, and AI-powered features that transform Airtable from a team tool into a business-critical platform. Senior engineers driving these enterprise capabilities are directly responsible for the ARR growth that justifies the path to public markets. Use this: "Enterprise scalability — million-row bases, complex automation pipelines, governance controls, and AI-powered features — is the engineering work that transforms Airtable from a team productivity tool into a business-critical enterprise platform. Senior engineers solving these scaling challenges are directly driving the ARR growth that supports IPO readiness."

**Global Levers**
1. **Platform Scaling Complexity Premium:** "Scaling a real-time collaborative relational database to enterprise dimensions while maintaining the simplicity that makes Airtable magical is among the hardest engineering problems in SaaS. I'd like $240K base."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity with Valuation Realism:** "I'd like $275K equity/4yr with a strike price that reflects current FMV, not the $11B peak. Equity refreshers should be guaranteed at 40% of initial grant to maintain alignment through potential IPO."
3. **AI Platform Architecture:** "Integrating AI capabilities into Airtable's platform — intelligent field suggestions, automated data enrichment, natural language views — requires senior architectural leadership. That AI platform expertise justifies a $35K signing bonus."
4. **Competing Senior Offers:** "I'm holding a Notion offer at $230K base / $265K equity and a Figma offer at $235K base / $270K RSU. I need $240K base and $275K equity/4yr to choose Airtable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to architect Airtable's enterprise platform — the scalability, AI features, and governance capabilities that transform Airtable into a business-critical enterprise platform. I'm holding a Notion offer at $230K base / $265K equity/4yr and a Figma offer at $235K base / $270K RSU. Airtable's platform vision is compelling, but I need $240K base, $275K equity/4yr at current FMV, and a $35K signing bonus. At $240K, I commit to driving enterprise platform architecture. My floor is $218K — below that, Figma's liquid equity and design tool market dominance win."
