**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Airtable build and operate the infrastructure that powers a collaborative data platform used by millions — managing the Kubernetes clusters, deployment pipelines, and reliability systems that ensure real-time collaboration, data consistency, and enterprise-grade availability. Airtable's infrastructure challenge is unique: the platform must maintain real-time collaboration with sub-second latency for thousands of concurrent users while handling diverse workloads (relational queries, automation execution, API traffic, file storage). Enterprise customers demand 99.99% availability and data residency compliance, raising the operational bar significantly. In 2026, DevOps Engineers are scaling the infrastructure to support the enterprise growth push.

**Global Levers**
1. **Real-Time Collaboration Infrastructure Complexity:** "Maintaining sub-second real-time collaboration for thousands of concurrent users while handling relational queries, automations, and API traffic is among the hardest infrastructure challenges in SaaS. I'd like $193K base."
2. **Enterprise SLA Revenue Protection:** "99.99% availability directly protects enterprise contracts worth millions in ARR. I'm the operational foundation of enterprise trust — $160K equity/4yr."
3. **Data Residency Compliance Expertise:** "Enterprise data residency compliance (GDPR, data sovereignty) requires specialized infrastructure architecture. My experience with [multi-region deployment / compliance infrastructure] accelerates this — $20K signing bonus."
4. **Competing DevOps Offers:** "I'm holding a Notion SRE offer at $182K base / $168K equity and a Datadog offer at $185K base / $178K RSU. I need $193K base and $160K equity/4yr to choose Airtable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the enterprise infrastructure that makes Airtable reliable enough for Fortune 500 customers — multi-region deployment, data residency compliance, and 99.99% availability. I'm holding a Datadog offer at $185K base / $178K RSU/4yr. Airtable's infrastructure challenges are uniquely compelling, but I need $193K base, $160K equity/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $193K, I'm in. My floor is $175K — below that, Datadog's liquid equity and infrastructure scope win."
