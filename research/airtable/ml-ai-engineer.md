### ML/AI Engineer | Airtable Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** No-Code/Low-Code Platform Leader | Series F ($11B Peak Valuation) | Pre-IPO Equity | Enterprise Growth Push | **+15-25% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $188K–$245K | $148K–$270K | 5–10% | $248K–$350K |
| NYC / Austin | $178K–$235K | $135K–$248K | 5–10% | $233K–$330K |
| London | £143K–£187K | £112K–£205K | 5–10% | £189K–£267K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Airtable are building the intelligence layer that transforms the platform from a blank-canvas data tool into an AI-powered application builder — intelligent schema suggestions, automated data enrichment, natural language base creation, AI-powered automations, and smart field types that predict and populate data automatically. This is a rapidly growing function at Airtable, driven by the AI revolution and competitive pressure from Notion AI, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Workspace AI. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects the scarcity of ML engineers who understand both production AI systems and the unique challenges of building AI for non-technical users — where the AI must be intuitive, explainable, and safe to use without ML expertise.

### 🏗️ AI-Powered No-Code Application Platform Lever
In 2026, Airtable is betting on AI to democratize application building — enabling non-technical users to create sophisticated business applications through natural language, intelligent templates, and automated configuration. ML/AI Engineers building these capabilities are creating the product features that differentiate Airtable from Notion, Monday.com, and Microsoft's low-code ecosystem. Use this: "AI-powered no-code application building is Airtable's product strategy for 2026 and beyond — natural language base creation, intelligent automations, and AI-assisted app design that lets anyone build enterprise-grade applications. ML Engineers who can build AI that's powerful enough for enterprise use cases yet intuitive for non-technical users are creating Airtable's most important competitive advantage."

**Global Levers**
1. **AI No-Code Platform Premium:** "The +15-25% AI Premium applies because building AI for non-technical users is harder than building AI for engineers — the AI must be intuitive, safe, and explainable without ML expertise. I'd like $240K base."
2. **Behavioral Data AI Advantage:** "Airtable's platform data — how millions of users structure, automate, and interact with data — is the ideal training corpus for no-code AI. My experience building [AI features / LLM applications / user-facing ML] accelerates this — $265K equity/4yr."
3. **Competitive AI Race Urgency:** "Notion AI, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Workspace AI are all competing for the same users. Airtable must ship compelling AI features quickly. That urgency justifies a $30K signing bonus for immediate productivity."
4. **Competing AI Platform Offers:** "I'm holding a Notion AI offer at $228K base / $255K equity and a Microsoft AI offer at $235K base / $270K RSU. I need $240K base and $265K equity/4yr to choose Airtable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the AI that makes Airtable the most intelligent no-code platform — natural language base creation, smart automations, and AI-assisted application design that lets anyone build enterprise-grade applications. I'm holding a Notion AI offer at $228K base / $255K equity/4yr and a Microsoft AI offer at $235K base / $270K RSU. Airtable's behavioral data corpus is the richest training data for no-code AI, and I want to build on it. I need $240K base, $265K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. The AI Premium applies. At $240K, I commit. My floor is $218K — below that, Microsoft's AI resources and liquid equity win."
