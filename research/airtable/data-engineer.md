**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Airtable build the analytics infrastructure, data pipelines, and business intelligence systems that power product insights, growth analytics, and enterprise customer intelligence. This is a particularly interesting data engineering role because Airtable itself is a data platform — you're building data infrastructure for a company whose core product is data infrastructure. That meta-level creates an exceptionally high technical bar: Airtable's Data Engineers must understand relational data modeling, real-time event streams, and large-scale analytics while leveraging insights from how millions of users structure and interact with data on the platform. In 2026, the data engineering focus is on enterprise analytics — usage intelligence, adoption metrics, and the data-driven insights that support enterprise sales and pricing optimization.

### 🏗️ Enterprise Analytics & PLG Intelligence Lever
Airtable's product-led growth (PLG) depends on understanding how users adopt, expand, and monetize on the platform — and Data Engineers build the analytics infrastructure that provides these insights. In 2026, the focus is on enterprise adoption analytics: tracking how teams scale from free to enterprise plans, identifying expansion opportunities within large organizations, and building the usage intelligence that optimizes pricing and packaging. Use this: "PLG analytics infrastructure — adoption funnels, expansion intelligence, usage-based pricing data, and enterprise conversion metrics — directly drives the revenue growth that supports Airtable's path to public markets. Data Engineers building this analytics infrastructure are the intelligence layer behind enterprise sales."

**Global Levers**
1. **Data Platform Company Data Premium:** "Building data infrastructure inside a data platform company means working at an exceptionally high technical bar. I'd like $198K base to reflect this elevated standard."
2. **Enterprise PLG Analytics Ownership:** "I'll own the analytics infrastructure that tracks enterprise adoption, expansion, and conversion — metrics that directly inform pricing, sales, and investor reporting. That business impact justifies $168K equity/4yr."
3. **Usage Intelligence Revenue Impact:** "Usage-based pricing intelligence directly impacts revenue per customer. My analytics pipelines inform the pricing decisions that optimize ARR — $20K signing bonus."
4. **Competing Data Engineering Offers:** "I'm holding a Notion offer at $188K base / $175K equity and a Databricks offer at $192K base / $195K RSU. I need $198K base and $168K equity/4yr to choose Airtable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the analytics infrastructure that powers Airtable's enterprise growth — PLG adoption funnels, expansion intelligence, and usage-based pricing analytics. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $192K base / $195K RSU/4yr. Airtable's data challenges are uniquely compelling, but I need $198K base, $168K equity/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $198K, I commit. My floor is $178K — below that, Databricks' liquid equity and data platform scope win."
