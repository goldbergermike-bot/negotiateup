**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Airtable build the platform that millions of teams use to organize work, automate processes, and build custom applications — without writing code. Airtable occupies a unique position at the intersection of databases, spreadsheets, and application platforms, and engineers work on core platform systems (relational data engine, real-time collaboration, API platform), automation frameworks, and the integration ecosystem that connects Airtable to thousands of enterprise tools. Airtable reached an $11B peak valuation during its 2021 Series F, though the valuation has likely compressed in the current market. Pre-IPO equity negotiations should account for this valuation uncertainty. In 2026, Airtable is focused on enterprise growth — larger customers, more complex use cases, and AI-powered features that expand what's possible on the platform.

### 🏗️ Enterprise Platform & AI Features Lever
In 2026, Airtable is investing in enterprise capabilities — advanced permissions, governance, scalability for large datasets, and AI-powered features that help teams build more sophisticated applications. Software Engineers building these enterprise features are directly driving the ARR growth that supports valuation recovery and a potential IPO path. Use this: "Airtable's enterprise push is the #1 growth initiative — advanced permissions, governance controls, large-dataset performance, and AI features. Engineers building enterprise capabilities are directly driving the ARR growth that supports Airtable's path to public markets."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity with Valuation Awareness:** "Airtable's equity carries pre-IPO upside, but I'm aware of valuation compression from the $11B peak. I'd like $160K equity/4yr at a strike price that reflects current fair market value, with refresh commitment."
2. **No-Code Platform Engineering Complexity:** "Building a database-app-platform hybrid that non-technical users can operate while scaling to enterprise requirements is among the hardest product engineering challenges in SaaS. I'd like $193K base."
3. **Competing Platform Offers:** "I'm holding a Notion offer at $185K base / $170K equity and a Monday.com offer at $178K base / $160K RSU. I need $193K base and $160K equity/4yr to choose Airtable."
4. **AI Feature Development Premium:** "Airtable's AI-powered features are the product differentiator for 2026. My experience with [LLM integration / AI feature development / ML systems] accelerates this roadmap — $20K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building Airtable's next-generation enterprise platform — the scalability, governance, and AI-powered features that drive enterprise adoption. I'm holding a Notion offer at $185K base / $170K equity/4yr. Airtable's platform vision and enterprise opportunity are compelling, but I need $193K base, $160K equity/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $193K, I sign this week. My floor is $175K — below that, Notion's equity and product velocity win."
