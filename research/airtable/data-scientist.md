**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Airtable work at the fascinating intersection of user behavior analytics, product intelligence, and platform economics — analyzing how millions of users create, structure, and interact with data to drive product decisions, growth strategies, and enterprise pricing. This is a uniquely rich data science role: Airtable's platform generates an extraordinary corpus of structured data about how people organize information, build workflows, and collaborate — making it a natural laboratory for understanding human data interaction patterns. In 2026, Data Scientists are focused on enterprise intelligence: predicting which teams will convert to paid plans, identifying expansion opportunities, and building the ML models that power Airtable's AI-assisted features.

### 🏗️ AI-Powered Platform Intelligence & Growth ML Lever
In 2026, Airtable is investing in ML-powered platform intelligence — AI features that recommend base structures, suggest automations, predict schema designs, and help users build more sophisticated applications faster. Data Scientists building these models are creating product features that differentiate Airtable from competitors and drive enterprise adoption. Use this: "ML-powered platform intelligence — schema recommendations, automation suggestions, and predictive data enrichment — transforms Airtable from a blank canvas into an intelligent assistant that makes every user more productive. Data Scientists building these models are creating the AI features that drive enterprise conversion and retention."

**Global Levers**
1. **Platform Behavior Data Richness:** "Airtable's platform generates one of the richest behavioral datasets in SaaS — how millions of users structure, interact with, and automate data. Building ML on this corpus is a unique opportunity. I'd like $208K base."
2. **AI Feature Product Impact:** "The ML models I build will become product features — schema suggestions, automation recommendations, intelligent field types. That direct product impact justifies $180K equity/4yr."
3. **Enterprise Growth ML Ownership:** "I'll own the growth ML models that predict enterprise conversion, identify expansion opportunities, and optimize pricing. Those models directly drive ARR — $25K signing bonus."
4. **Competing DS Offers:** "I'm holding a Notion DS offer at $195K base / $185K equity and a Figma DS offer at $200K base / $192K RSU. I need $208K base and $180K equity/4yr to choose Airtable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the ML-powered intelligence that makes Airtable the smartest work platform — schema recommendations, automation suggestions, and growth models that drive enterprise adoption. I'm holding a Figma DS offer at $200K base / $192K RSU/4yr. Airtable's behavioral data richness is unmatched, and I want to build AI on it. I need $208K base, $180K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $208K, I commit. My floor is $188K — below that, Figma's liquid equity and data science scope win."
