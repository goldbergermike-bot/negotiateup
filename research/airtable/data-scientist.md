**Global Levers**
1. **Platform Behavior Data Richness:** "Airtable's platform generates one of the richest behavioral datasets in SaaS — how millions of users structure, interact with, and automate data. Building ML on this corpus is a unique opportunity. I'd like $208K base."
2. **AI Feature Product Impact:** "The ML models I build will become product features — schema suggestions, automation recommendations, intelligent field types. That direct product impact justifies $180K equity/4yr."
3. **Enterprise Growth ML Ownership:** "I'll own the growth ML models that predict enterprise conversion, identify expansion opportunities, and optimize pricing. Those models directly drive ARR — $25K signing bonus."
4. **Competing DS Offers:** "I'm holding a Notion DS offer at $195K base / $185K equity and a Figma DS offer at $200K base / $192K RSU. I need $208K base and $180K equity/4yr to choose Airtable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the ML-powered intelligence that makes Airtable the smartest work platform — schema recommendations, automation suggestions, and growth models that drive enterprise adoption. I'm holding a Figma DS offer at $200K base / $192K RSU/4yr. Airtable's behavioral data richness is unmatched, and I want to build AI on it. I need $208K base, $180K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $208K, I commit. My floor is $188K — below that, Figma's liquid equity and data science scope win."
