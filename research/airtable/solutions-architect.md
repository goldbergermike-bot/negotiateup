**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Airtable design enterprise-scale implementations that transform how organizations manage work, data, and processes — deploying Airtable as the backbone for operations, marketing, product management, HR, and finance workflows across Fortune 500 companies. The SA role at Airtable is uniquely consultative: you're helping enterprise customers reimagine their business processes using a no-code platform, which requires understanding both the customer's operational workflows and Airtable's platform capabilities (interfaces, automations, API integrations, extensions). SAs who can architect solutions that demonstrate 10x productivity gains versus custom software or legacy tools are closing the largest deals and driving enterprise expansion.

### 🏗️ Enterprise Deployment Architecture & Expansion Lever
In 2026, Airtable's enterprise growth strategy depends on SAs who can design deployment architectures that span entire organizations — multi-department implementations, cross-functional workflows, and enterprise governance that demonstrates Airtable's value as a business-critical platform rather than a team tool. SAs driving these enterprise-wide deployments are directly responsible for the largest expansion deals. Use this: "Enterprise-wide Airtable deployments — spanning multiple departments, integrating with existing enterprise tools, and demonstrating business-critical value — are the deals that drive ARR growth. SAs who can architect these large-scale implementations and prove ROI are directly responsible for Airtable's enterprise revenue expansion."

**Global Levers**
1. **Enterprise Workflow Architecture Premium:** "Designing enterprise-scale no-code implementations that transform business processes across departments requires rare consultative and technical expertise. I'd like $210K base."
2. **Enterprise Deal Size Impact:** "My architecture work directly determines deal size — enterprise-wide deployments are 10-50x larger than team-level deals. That revenue multiplier justifies $210K equity/4yr."
3. **Competitive Displacement Expertise:** "My knowledge of [Salesforce / ServiceNow / custom software / legacy tools] enables me to architect Airtable migrations that demonstrate 10x productivity gains. That competitive intelligence justifies a $25K signing bonus."
4. **Competing SA Offers:** "I'm holding a Notion SA offer at $200K base / $205K equity and a Salesforce SA offer at $198K base / $210K RSU. I need $210K base and $210K equity/4yr to choose Airtable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to architect the enterprise-wide Airtable deployments that transform how Fortune 500 companies manage work — multi-department implementations, cross-functional workflows, and enterprise governance that make Airtable a business-critical platform. I'm holding a Salesforce SA offer at $198K base / $210K RSU/4yr. Airtable's platform potential for enterprise transformation is unmatched, and I want to help customers realize it. I need $210K base, $210K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $210K, I commit to driving enterprise architecture wins. My floor is $190K — below that, Salesforce's brand recognition and liquid equity win."
