**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Airtable coordinate the cross-functional programs that drive the platform's enterprise transformation — enterprise feature launches, AI product rollouts, scalability initiatives, compliance certifications, and the multi-team initiatives that define Airtable's product strategy. In a relatively lean organization, TPMs have outsized influence: each program manager coordinates multiple teams across engineering, product, design, and go-to-market. In 2026, the most critical programs are enterprise readiness (governance, compliance, scalability) and AI feature integration — both requiring cross-functional coordination that TPMs lead.

### 🏗️ Enterprise Readiness & AI Integration Program Lever
Airtable's most critical programs in 2026 are the enterprise readiness initiative (governance features, compliance certifications, enterprise scalability) and the AI integration program (natural language features, intelligent automations, AI-assisted app building). TPMs coordinating these programs are managing the strategic initiatives that determine whether Airtable achieves the enterprise revenue growth needed for a potential IPO path. Use this: "The enterprise readiness and AI integration programs are the most strategically important initiatives at Airtable — the work that determines whether the platform achieves the enterprise revenue growth needed for public markets. TPMs coordinating these cross-functional programs are directly shaping the company's trajectory."

**Global Levers**
1. **Strategic Program Leadership Premium:** "Leading enterprise readiness and AI integration programs at Airtable is the most strategically important TPM work at the company. I'd like $215K base."
2. **Lean Organization Impact Multiplier:** "In Airtable's lean TPM organization, I'll coordinate multiple strategic programs simultaneously. That outsized scope justifies $215K equity/4yr."
3. **Cross-Functional AI Program Coordination:** "Coordinating AI feature launches across engineering, product, design, data science, and go-to-market requires specialized program management skill for emerging technology. $25K signing bonus."
4. **Competing TPM Offers:** "I'm holding a Notion TPM offer at $203K base / $210K equity and a Figma TPM offer at $208K base / $215K RSU. I need $215K base and $215K equity/4yr to choose Airtable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to lead the programs that transform Airtable into an AI-powered enterprise platform — coordinating the enterprise readiness initiative, AI feature integration, and compliance certification programs that drive Fortune 500 adoption. I'm holding a Figma TPM offer at $208K base / $215K RSU/4yr. Airtable's program complexity and strategic importance are compelling, but I need $215K base, $215K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $215K, I commit. My floor is $195K — below that, Figma's liquid equity and established TPM structure win."
