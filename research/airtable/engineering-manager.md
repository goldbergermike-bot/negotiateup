**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Airtable lead the teams building one of the most complex collaborative data platforms in SaaS — managing engineers who work on the relational data engine, real-time collaboration, automation framework, AI features, and enterprise capabilities. This is an EM role that demands strong technical judgment: Airtable's engineering decisions directly impact how millions of non-technical users experience data, and every architectural choice must balance simplicity (for end users) with sophistication (for enterprise requirements). In 2026, EMs are navigating the company's enterprise transformation — scaling teams, establishing enterprise engineering processes, and maintaining the product-minded engineering culture that built the platform while meeting enterprise customer demands.

### 🏗️ Enterprise Transformation Leadership Lever
Airtable's shift from a team productivity tool to an enterprise platform requires EM leadership that can scale engineering teams, establish enterprise development practices, and drive the product velocity needed to compete with Notion, Monday.com, and Microsoft's low-code offerings. EMs who can execute this transformation while retaining top engineers through the pre-IPO uncertainty are commanding premium compensation. Use this: "Airtable's enterprise transformation requires EMs who can scale teams, establish enterprise engineering practices, and maintain product velocity during a critical growth phase. EMs who can retain top talent through pre-IPO uncertainty while delivering enterprise features are the leadership backbone of this transformation."

**Global Levers**
1. **Enterprise Transformation EM Premium:** "Leading engineering through Airtable's enterprise transformation — scaling teams, establishing enterprise practices, and driving product velocity — is the most critical leadership challenge at the company. I'd like $260K base."
2. **Pre-IPO Retention Leadership:** "Retaining top engineers through pre-IPO uncertainty is my most important responsibility. I'd like $370K equity/4yr with front-loaded vesting to align my incentives with team stability."
3. **Product-Minded Engineering Culture:** "Airtable's engineering culture is product-minded — EMs must balance user simplicity with technical sophistication. My track record of building teams that ship elegant, scalable products justifies a $40K signing bonus."
4. **Competing EM Offers:** "I'm holding a Notion EM offer at $248K base / $360K equity and a Figma EM offer at $255K base / $370K RSU. I need $260K base and $375K equity/4yr to choose Airtable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to lead Airtable engineering through the enterprise transformation — scaling teams, establishing processes, and building the engineering organization that delivers Fortune 500-ready platform capabilities. I'm holding EM offers from Notion at $248K base / $360K equity/4yr and Figma at $255K base / $370K RSU. Airtable's platform vision is the most ambitious, and I want to lead the teams that build it. I need $260K base, $375K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $40K signing bonus. At $260K, I commit to leading this transformation. My floor is $238K — below that, Figma's liquid equity and established EM ladder win."
