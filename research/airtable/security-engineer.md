**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Airtable protect a platform that enterprises trust with sensitive business data — customer records, project plans, financial models, HR information, and proprietary workflows stored in millions of bases. The no-code nature of Airtable creates unique security challenges: users create complex data structures and automations without understanding security implications, making it critical that the platform provides security guardrails that are invisible to users but robust enough for enterprise compliance. In 2026, the enterprise push means Security Engineers are building SOC2 Type II, ISO 27001, and HIPAA compliance capabilities while hardening the platform for government and financial services customers.

### 🏗️ Enterprise Security Compliance & Data Trust Lever
Airtable's enterprise expansion depends on security compliance — enterprises won't adopt a data platform that doesn't meet their compliance requirements. In 2026, Security Engineers are building the compliance certifications (SOC2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA, FedRAMP), enterprise governance features (SSO, audit logging, DLP), and data security architecture that Fortune 500 customers demand. Use this: "Enterprise security compliance is the gating requirement for Airtable's largest deals. Security Engineers building SOC2, HIPAA, and FedRAMP-ready security architecture are directly enabling the enterprise contracts that drive ARR growth and support the path to public markets."

**Global Levers**
1. **No-Code Platform Security Complexity:** "Securing a no-code platform where non-technical users create complex data structures and automations creates unique security challenges — users unknowingly create risks that the platform must silently mitigate. I'd like $220K base for this specialized expertise."
2. **Enterprise Compliance Acceleration:** "SOC2 Type II, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 certifications are on the critical path for enterprise deals. My experience with [compliance frameworks / security audits / enterprise certifications] directly accelerates this — $235K equity/4yr."
3. **Data Trust Revenue Impact:** "Enterprise customers trust Airtable with their most sensitive business data. My security work directly protects that trust, which is the foundation of every enterprise renewal — $30K signing bonus."
4. **Competing Security Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike offer at $210K base / $235K RSU and a Notion security offer at $205K base / $225K equity. I need $220K base and $235K equity/4yr to choose Airtable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the security foundation that makes Airtable trusted by the Fortune 500 — enterprise compliance certifications, data governance architecture, and the security guardrails that protect millions of users. I'm holding a CrowdStrike offer at $210K base / $235K RSU/4yr. Airtable's security challenges are uniquely complex for a no-code platform, and I want to solve them. I need $220K base, $235K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $220K, I commit to building enterprise-grade security. My floor is $200K — below that, CrowdStrike's liquid equity and security focus win."
