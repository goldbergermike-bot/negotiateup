**Negotiation DNA**
Staff Software Engineers at Airtable are the technical architects who define how the platform evolves — designing the data engine architecture that supports enterprise-scale relational data, the real-time collaboration infrastructure that enables thousands of concurrent users, and the platform abstractions that allow non-technical users to build sophisticated applications. At the staff level, you're one of the most influential technical leaders in a company with a relatively lean engineering organization, which means outsized impact per architect. Pre-IPO equity at the staff level is significant, and negotiation should focus on both grant size and strike price given the valuation uncertainty. Staff engineers joining Airtable in 2026 have the opportunity to shape the platform's architecture for the enterprise era.

### 🏗️ Platform Architecture for Enterprise Scale Lever
Airtable's transformation from a team productivity tool to a business-critical enterprise platform requires fundamental architectural evolution — and staff engineers are making the architectural decisions that determine whether this transformation succeeds. Designing data engine scaling, enterprise multi-tenancy, AI platform integration, and API platform evolution are the staff-level challenges that define Airtable's next chapter. Use this: "Airtable's enterprise transformation requires architectural evolution at every layer of the platform — data engine scaling, multi-tenancy, AI integration, and API platform maturity. Staff engineers making these architectural decisions are shaping the platform's ability to serve Fortune 500 customers, directly determining whether Airtable achieves the enterprise revenue that supports public markets."

**Global Levers**
1. **Architectural Transformation Leadership:** "Airtable's enterprise transformation requires fundamental platform re-architecture. Staff engineers leading this transformation are doing the most consequential technical work in the company's history. I'd like $285K base and $450K equity/4yr."
2. **Lean Organization Impact Multiplier:** "Airtable's relatively lean engineering org means staff engineers have outsized architectural influence. I'll be setting technical direction that affects the entire platform — that leverage justifies front-loaded vesting (35% year one) and a $50K signing bonus."
3. **Valuation Recovery Equity Alignment:** "I believe in Airtable's enterprise transformation, and I want equity that lets me benefit from the valuation recovery. $450K equity/4yr at current FMV with aggressive refreshers ensures alignment through potential IPO."
4. **Competing Staff Offers:** "I'm holding a Notion staff offer at $275K base / $430K equity and a Figma staff offer at $280K base / $440K RSU. I need $285K base and $450K equity/4yr to choose Airtable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to architect Airtable's enterprise platform transformation — the data engine scaling, multi-tenancy, AI integration, and API platform evolution that make Airtable a business-critical tool for the Fortune 500. I'm holding staff offers from Notion at $275K base / $430K equity/4yr and Figma at $280K base / $440K RSU. Airtable's platform vision is the most ambitious, and I want to architect it. I need $285K base, $450K equity/4yr at current FMV with 35% year-one vesting, and a $50K signing bonus. At $285K, I commit to leading Airtable's enterprise architecture. My floor is $258K — below that, Figma's liquid equity and established platform architecture win."
