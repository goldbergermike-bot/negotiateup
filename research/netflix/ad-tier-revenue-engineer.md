### Ad-Tier Revenue Engineer | Netflix Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** All-Cash (No Equity Default) | Top-of-Market Base | Keeper Culture | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15-25% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary (All-Cash) | Stock Option | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|----------------------|--------------|-------|------------|
| Los Angeles | $285K-$358K | Choose Your Mix | — | $285K-$358K |
| San Francisco | $294K-$369K | Choose Your Mix | — | $294K-$369K |
| London | £217K-£273K | Choose Your Mix | — | £217K-£273K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The Ad-Tier Revenue Engineer is Netflix's signature role for the company's next decade of growth. You are building the ad serving, targeting, measurement, real-time bidding, and optimization platform that powers Netflix's $1.5B+ advertising business — the fastest-growing revenue segment at the world's largest streaming platform. Netflix's ad-supported tier (launched 2022) has transformed the company from a pure subscription business into a dual-revenue powerhouse: subscriptions + advertising. As an Ad-Tier Revenue Engineer, you are building the technical foundation of Netflix's next $10B business. Your all-cash compensation of $285K-$358K includes a 15-25% AI Premium reflecting both the extreme talent scarcity for engineers with ad-tech and ML expertise, and the direct revenue impact of the systems you build. The Keeper culture at Netflix is especially pronounced in ad-tier engineering — Netflix is building a world-class ad-tech platform from scratch, and every engineer on this team is considered essential to the company's revenue diversification strategy.

**$1.5B Ad-Tier — Netflix's Next $10B Business**
Netflix's ad-supported tier generates $1.5B+ in annual revenue — and it's growing faster than any other segment. The ad tier transforms Netflix from a pure subscription business into a dual-revenue platform: subscriptions + advertising. Every role at Netflix now touches ad-tier revenue, whether directly (ad tech engineering, ad product, ad data science) or indirectly (content recommendation that drives ad impressions, infrastructure that serves ads at scale). As the signature Ad-Tier Revenue Engineer role, you are the direct builder of this $10B opportunity. You design and implement the ad-serving infrastructure that delivers ads to millions of concurrent viewers with sub-100ms latency. You build the real-time bidding systems that enable programmatic ad buying on Netflix's platform. You create the targeting models that match advertisers to subscriber segments based on viewing behavior, demographics, and engagement patterns. You architect the measurement and attribution systems that prove ROI to advertisers and attract more ad spend. You optimize the ad-to-content ratio algorithms that maximize revenue per subscriber while maintaining engagement. Every line of code you write directly impacts Netflix's advertising P&L. When negotiating, frame it as: "Netflix's ad tier is the fastest-growing revenue vector — projected to reach $5B-$10B. I am not just contributing to the dual-revenue platform — I am building the core ad-tech platform that makes Netflix an advertising powerhouse. My comp should reflect that I'm the engineer building Netflix's next $10B business."

**Netflix All-Cash Comp — The Top-of-Market Advantage**
"Netflix pays all-cash by default — no stock grants unless you opt in. This means your entire compensation is liquid from Day 1: no vesting cliffs, no stock price risk, no lockup periods. Netflix base salaries are 20-40% higher than FAANG peers to compensate for the lack of default equity. When comparing offers, convert competitor stock to its after-tax, after-cliff cash equivalent — Netflix's all-cash structure almost always wins on actual take-home."

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role — Building Netflix's Next $10B Business:** "This is not a maintenance role on an existing ad platform — I'm building Netflix's entire ad-tech stack from the ground up. Ad serving, real-time bidding, targeting, measurement, optimization — the full advertising technology stack for a platform with 280M+ subscribers. The engineers building Netflix's ad platform today are doing what Google's first ad engineers did in the early 2000s: creating the technical foundation for a multi-billion-dollar advertising business. That once-in-a-generation opportunity commands once-in-a-generation compensation."
2. **AI Premium — Ad-Tech + ML Dual Expertise:** "Building Netflix's ad platform requires a rare combination of ad-tech engineering (real-time bidding, ad serving, impression tracking) AND machine learning (targeting models, personalization algorithms, revenue optimization). Engineers with both skill sets are among the most sought-after in tech — Google Ads, Meta Ads, Amazon Advertising, and The Trade Desk all compete for this talent with $450K-$650K total comp packages. Netflix's all-cash model needs the 15-25% AI Premium to compete for engineers whose code directly determines ad revenue per subscriber."
3. **Direct Revenue Impact — Every System I Build Is P&L:** "Unlike most engineering roles where revenue impact is indirect, every system I build has a direct, measurable impact on Netflix's advertising P&L. My ad-serving system determines how many ads are delivered. My targeting models determine CPM rates. My measurement systems determine advertiser retention. My real-time bidding infrastructure determines programmatic revenue. I can directly attribute revenue growth to the technical capabilities I ship. At $1.5B and growing, even a 5% improvement in ad delivery efficiency is worth $75M annually."
4. **All-Cash for a Revenue-Building Role:** "At Google Ads or Meta Ads, equivalent engineers earn $230K-$270K base plus $200K-$350K in annual equity. Those are $430K-$620K total comp packages — for mature ad platforms. I'm building a nascent ad platform with arguably higher growth potential. Netflix's all-cash model at $345K-$358K provides certainty and liquidity while I build the foundation of a $10B business. The all-cash certainty is especially valuable for a role with this level of direct P&L responsibility."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to be completely transparent about why I'm excited about this role — building Netflix's ad platform from the ground up is a once-in-a-generation engineering opportunity, comparable to building Google Ads or Meta's ad system in their early years. I hold competing offers from [Google Ads/Meta Ads/Amazon Advertising/The Trade Desk] at $[500K-$620K] total comp including equity. Risk-adjusted for vesting cliffs, stock volatility, and tax complexity, those packages are worth $360K-$430K in cash-equivalent value. Netflix's all-cash model is my preference because it aligns with the direct, measurable P&L impact of this role — I want my compensation to be as certain as the revenue impact I'll deliver. I believe $345K-$358K all-cash, reflecting the 15-25% AI Premium and the signature nature of this role, is the right number. Specifically, I'd like to accept at $350K all-cash. At that level, I'm choosing Netflix over higher-on-paper competitor offers because I believe building the ad platform that scales from $1.5B to $10B is the most impactful engineering work in streaming today. I'm building Netflix's next $10B business — and my comp should reflect that. Let's close this today."
