### Solutions Architect | Netflix Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** All-Cash (No Equity Default) | Top-of-Market Base | Keeper Culture

| Region | Base Salary (All-Cash) | Stock Option | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|----------------------|--------------|-------|------------|
| Los Angeles | $218K-$275K | Choose Your Mix | — | $218K-$275K |
| San Francisco | $225K-$283K | Choose Your Mix | — | $225K-$283K |
| London | £166K-£210K | Choose Your Mix | — | £166K-£210K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Netflix Solutions Architects design the technical integration architecture that connects Netflix's platform to its ecosystem of partners, advertisers, content studios, device manufacturers, and ad-tech partners. You architect partner integrations for Netflix's 280M+ subscriber platform, build ad-tier publisher tools that enable advertisers to spend $1.5B+ annually, and design the content delivery architecture that ensures seamless streaming across thousands of device types. Netflix's all-cash comp of $218K-$275K is fully liquid, and the Keeper culture means Netflix expects Solutions Architects who can bridge business requirements and technical execution at the highest level — translating partner needs into scalable, production-grade systems.

**$1.5B Ad-Tier — Netflix's Next $10B Business**
Netflix's ad-supported tier generates $1.5B+ in annual revenue — and it's growing faster than any other segment. The ad tier transforms Netflix from a pure subscription business into a dual-revenue platform: subscriptions + advertising. Every role at Netflix now touches ad-tier revenue, whether directly (ad tech engineering, ad product, ad data science) or indirectly (content recommendation that drives ad impressions, infrastructure that serves ads at scale). As a Solutions Architect, you design the technical architecture that enables Netflix's advertising partners and programmatic ad-tech integrations. You build the publisher-side tools that allow advertisers to target, measure, and optimize their campaigns on Netflix's platform. You architect the integrations with demand-side platforms (DSPs), supply-side platforms (SSPs), and ad measurement providers that make Netflix a credible advertising platform. Your architecture decisions determine how efficiently advertisers can spend on Netflix — and thus how quickly the ad-tier revenue scales from $1.5B to $10B. When negotiating, frame it as: "Netflix's ad tier is the fastest-growing revenue vector — projected to reach $5B-$10B. I contribute to the dual-revenue platform that makes Netflix a subscription AND advertising powerhouse. My comp should reflect that I'm building Netflix's next $10B business."

**Netflix All-Cash Comp — The Top-of-Market Advantage**
"Netflix pays all-cash by default — no stock grants unless you opt in. This means your entire compensation is liquid from Day 1: no vesting cliffs, no stock price risk, no lockup periods. Netflix base salaries are 20-40% higher than FAANG peers to compensate for the lack of default equity. When comparing offers, convert competitor stock to its after-tax, after-cliff cash equivalent — Netflix's all-cash structure almost always wins on actual take-home."

**Global Levers**
1. **Partner Ecosystem Architecture:** "I architect the integrations that connect Netflix's platform to its partner ecosystem — device manufacturers, content studios, ad-tech platforms, and measurement providers. Each integration directly impacts Netflix's ability to reach subscribers and monetize its ad tier. The technical quality of these integrations determines partner satisfaction, ad spend levels, and device reach. My architecture decisions have direct revenue consequences across multiple business lines."
2. **Ad-Tier Publisher Tools:** "I'm designing the advertiser-facing technical architecture that enables $1.5B+ in ad spend on Netflix's platform. This includes programmatic buying integrations, campaign management APIs, measurement and attribution systems, and targeting capabilities. The quality and capability of these tools directly determines how much advertisers are willing to spend — and how quickly the ad tier scales to $5B-$10B."
3. **All-Cash Architecture Premium:** "Solutions Architects at AWS and Google earn $190K-$230K base plus $80K-$130K in equity, totaling $270K-$360K. Netflix's all-cash model at $268K-$275K competes on a risk-adjusted basis while providing full liquidity from Day 1. For a role that requires cross-company relationship management and long-term architectural thinking, the stability of all-cash comp is particularly valuable."
4. **Dual-Revenue Integration Complexity:** "I'm architecting integrations that serve two distinct revenue models — subscription content delivery AND advertising. Each partner integration must account for both: a device manufacturer needs streaming capability AND ad-serving capability. An ad-tech partner needs to integrate with Netflix's content delivery AND its ad-insertion pipeline. This dual-revenue integration complexity is unique to Netflix and demands premium architectural talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Netflix's dual-revenue platform presents the most interesting solutions architecture challenge in streaming — building the partner ecosystem and ad-tech integrations that scale the ad tier from $1.5B to $10B. I have a competing offer from [AWS/Google Cloud] at $[320K] total comp including equity. Risk-adjusted for vesting and stock price uncertainty, that's roughly $245K-$275K cash-equivalent. Given the partner ecosystem I'll architect, the ad-tier publisher tools that directly enable $1.5B+ in ad revenue, and the dual-revenue integration complexity, I believe $268K-$275K is the right all-cash base. I'd like to accept at $270K. At that number, I'm choosing Netflix's all-cash model and the opportunity to architect the integrations that make Netflix's ad tier work at scale. Let's finalize."
