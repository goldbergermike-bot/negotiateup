### Solutions Architect (AWS) | Amazon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Back-Loaded RSU Vesting / Signing Bonus Bridge | Customer-Facing Technical Role

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Signing Bonus | Total Comp (Yr 1) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Seattle | $150K-$180K | $150K-$400K | $50K-$90K | $240K-$390K |
| Bay Area | $155K-$185K | $160K-$420K | $55K-$95K | $250K-$405K |
| NYC | $155K-$185K | $155K-$410K | $50K-$90K | $245K-$400K |
| Arlington VA | $150K-$180K | $150K-$400K | $50K-$90K | $240K-$390K |

**CRITICAL: Amazon's Back-Loaded RSU Vesting Schedule**

Amazon's RSU vesting is unlike any other major tech company. Instead of the standard 25% per year, Amazon uses a **5/15/40/40** schedule:
- **Year 1:** Only 5% of RSUs vest
- **Year 2:** Only 15% of RSUs vest
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

To compensate for the low Year 1-2 vesting, Amazon provides **large signing bonuses** paid out in Year 1 and Year 2. This means your Year 1 and Year 2 cash comp is heavily dependent on the signing bonus, while Years 3-4 are driven by massive RSU vests. **Always negotiate the signing bonus AND the RSU grant as separate levers.**

**Negotiation DNA**

AWS Solutions Architects are among the most recognized technical roles in cloud computing. SAs work directly with enterprise customers to design architectures on AWS, driving adoption and consumption of AWS services. This role sits at the intersection of deep technical knowledge and customer engagement -- SAs need to understand 200+ AWS services and translate customer business requirements into cloud architectures. The SA org is massive (thousands globally) and is structured by industry vertical (financial services, healthcare, media, government) and by technical specialty (AI/ML, data analytics, security, serverless, containers). AWS SAs carry individual customer revenue targets and are measured on customer adoption metrics, making this a revenue-influencing (though not commission-based) role. The SA role is a well-known pipeline to AWS product teams, startups, and senior technical leadership positions. [Source: AWS Solutions Architect Job Family 2025]

**Level Mapping:** AWS SA L5-L6 = Google Cloud Customer Engineer = Azure Solutions Architect = GCP SA

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue Influence Frame:** "AWS Solutions Architects directly influence customer adoption and consumption revenue. Every architecture I design determines how much a customer spends on AWS. A well-designed architecture for a single enterprise customer can drive $10M+ in annual AWS spend. My comp should reflect this direct revenue influence."
2. **Industry Vertical Premium:** If you specialize in a high-value vertical (financial services, healthcare/life sciences, government/DoD), your AWS certifications and domain expertise carry a premium: "My financial services background means I can immediately engage with AWS's highest-value customers. The FSI vertical generates disproportionate AWS revenue."
3. **Signing Bonus as Travel Comp:** SA roles involve significant customer travel. Use this: "The SA role requires substantial travel and customer engagement. The signing bonus should reflect the customer-facing demands of the role, which go beyond a standard engineering position."
4. **Leadership Principle Alignment:** Anchor to "Customer Obsession" (SAs are the embodiment of this LP), "Earn Trust" (building long-term customer relationships), and "Learn and Be Curious" (staying current on 200+ AWS services).

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $360K over 4 years, with Year 1 signing bonus of $80K and Year 2 at $50K. I bring [X] AWS certifications, [Y] years of enterprise cloud architecture experience, and deep expertise in [vertical]. My customer-facing skills and technical depth map directly to the L6 SA bar." Amazon will counter at $260K-$340K RSUs with $60K-$80K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if Year 1 TC exceeds $260K. If you hold the AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification and specialty certifications, use these as concrete evidence of readiness -- each cert reduces Amazon's ramp-up investment.
