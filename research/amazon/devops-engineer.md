### DevOps Engineer | Amazon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Back-Loaded RSU Vesting / Signing Bonus Bridge | "You Build It, You Run It" Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Signing Bonus | Total Comp (Yr 1) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Seattle | $140K-$175K | $130K-$350K | $45K-$90K | $220K-$360K |
| Bay Area | $145K-$180K | $140K-$370K | $50K-$95K | $230K-$375K |
| NYC | $140K-$180K | $135K-$360K | $45K-$90K | $225K-$370K |
| Austin | $130K-$170K | $120K-$320K | $40K-$80K | $200K-$340K |

**CRITICAL: Amazon's Back-Loaded RSU Vesting Schedule**

Amazon's RSU vesting is unlike any other major tech company. Instead of the standard 25% per year, Amazon uses a **5/15/40/40** schedule:
- **Year 1:** Only 5% of RSUs vest
- **Year 2:** Only 15% of RSUs vest
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

To compensate for the low Year 1-2 vesting, Amazon provides **large signing bonuses** paid out in Year 1 and Year 2. This means your Year 1 and Year 2 cash comp is heavily dependent on the signing bonus, while Years 3-4 are driven by massive RSU vests. **Always negotiate the signing bonus AND the RSU grant as separate levers.**

**Negotiation DNA**

Amazon pioneered the "you build it, you run it" philosophy that defines modern DevOps. At Amazon, DevOps Engineers (often titled Systems Development Engineers or SDEs with infrastructure focus) build and maintain the internal deployment, monitoring, and operational tooling that powers both Amazon.com and AWS. Amazon's internal infrastructure is legendary -- tools like Apollo (deployment), Brazil (build system), Pipelines (CI/CD), and the operational excellence frameworks that support services processing millions of transactions per second. The distinction at Amazon is that DevOps isn't a separate function -- it's embedded in every team. Dedicated DevOps/infrastructure engineers focus on platform-level tooling that serves hundreds of engineering teams. [Source: Amazon Systems Development Engineering 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Amazon L5 SysDev/DevOps = Google L4 SRE = Meta Production Engineer E4 = Netflix Senior SRE

**Global Levers**

1. **Operational Scale Frame:** "Amazon operates at a scale where a single deployment failure can impact millions of customers and hundreds of millions in revenue. The deployment and monitoring infrastructure I build is the safety net for the entire company. My comp should reflect the blast radius of this work."
2. **AWS Internal-to-External Pipeline:** Many internal Amazon DevOps tools eventually become AWS products (CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, CloudWatch all started as internal tools). Frame: "The tooling I build internally has a proven track record of becoming external AWS revenue-generating products. I'm not just building internal tools -- I'm potentially building the next AWS service."
3. **Signing Bonus Focus:** "I have competing offers from [Datadog/HashiCorp/Grafana Labs] where equity vests 25% in Year 1. With Amazon's 5% Year 1 vest, I need a signing bonus of $80K Year 1 and $55K Year 2 to achieve competitive Year 1-2 comp."
4. **Leadership Principle Alignment:** Anchor to "Operational Excellence" (this is literally the DevOps mandate), "Insist on the Highest Standards" (zero-downtime deployments, 99.999% uptime), and "Frugality" (infrastructure cost optimization).

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $320K over 4 years, with Year 1 signing bonus of $80K and Year 2 at $50K. My experience building [CI/CD platforms / Kubernetes infrastructure / monitoring systems] at scale directly maps to Amazon's infrastructure needs at L5." Amazon will counter at $240K-$300K RSUs with $55K-$75K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if Year 1 TC exceeds $235K. Push harder on the signing bonus than the RSU if you're unsure about staying past Year 2 -- the back-loaded vesting means RSU value is concentrated in Years 3-4.
