### Product Designer (UX Designer) | Amazon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Back-Loaded RSU Vesting / Signing Bonus Bridge | Customer Obsession-Driven Design

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Signing Bonus | Total Comp (Yr 1) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Seattle | $140K-$175K | $120K-$300K | $40K-$80K | $210K-$340K |
| Bay Area | $145K-$180K | $130K-$320K | $45K-$85K | $220K-$355K |
| NYC | $145K-$180K | $125K-$310K | $40K-$80K | $215K-$345K |
| Austin | $130K-$170K | $110K-$280K | $35K-$70K | $195K-$320K |

**CRITICAL: Amazon's Back-Loaded RSU Vesting Schedule**

Amazon's RSU vesting is unlike any other major tech company. Instead of the standard 25% per year, Amazon uses a **5/15/40/40** schedule:
- **Year 1:** Only 5% of RSUs vest
- **Year 2:** Only 15% of RSUs vest
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

To compensate for the low Year 1-2 vesting, Amazon provides **large signing bonuses** paid out in Year 1 and Year 2. This means your Year 1 and Year 2 cash comp is heavily dependent on the signing bonus, while Years 3-4 are driven by massive RSU vests. **Always negotiate the signing bonus AND the RSU grant as separate levers.**

**Negotiation DNA**

Amazon's design culture has historically been engineering-led and "function over form," but this is rapidly changing. The AWS Console, Alexa, Amazon.com, Prime Video, Ring, and Kuiper all require world-class design. Amazon has invested heavily in growing its UX design org, particularly for AWS (which has historically had complex, engineer-facing UIs) and consumer-facing AI experiences (Alexa, Rufus shopping assistant). Product Designers at Amazon are expected to be deeply data-driven -- every design decision should be backed by customer research and A/B testing. The company's "Customer Obsession" Leadership Principle is the design team's north star. Amazon calls these roles "UX Designer" internally, but the function maps to Product Designer at other companies. [Source: Amazon UX Design Job Family 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Amazon L5 UX Designer = Google L4 UX = Meta IC4 Product Designer = Apple ICT3 Design

**Global Levers**

1. **Design Maturity Uplift Frame:** "Amazon is investing in elevating its design quality across AWS and consumer products. I'm joining at an inflection point where design is becoming a competitive differentiator, not just a support function. My comp should reflect the strategic importance of this design maturity initiative."
2. **AWS Console Complexity Premium:** If the role is AWS-focused, the design challenges are uniquely complex -- designing for developer and enterprise personas with deeply technical products. "Designing for AWS means I need to translate extreme technical complexity into intuitive interfaces for millions of developers. This requires rare design+technical fluency."
3. **Signing Bonus as Competitive Lever:** Design talent has strong options at companies with uniform vesting (Apple, Google, Meta). "I have competing offers where 25% of equity vests in Year 1. With Amazon's 5% Year 1 vest, I need a signing bonus of $70K Year 1 and $45K Year 2 to make Year 1-2 comp competitive."
4. **Leadership Principle Alignment:** Anchor to "Customer Obsession" (design is the embodiment of this LP), "Earn Trust" (building user trust through intuitive design), and "Insist on the Highest Standards" (design quality bar).

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $280K over 4 years, with Year 1 signing bonus of $70K and Year 2 at $45K. My portfolio demonstrates [specific design outcomes] and my data-driven approach aligns with Amazon's experimentation culture." Amazon will counter at $200K-$260K RSUs with $50K-$65K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if Year 1 TC exceeds $225K. Note: Design roles at Amazon have historically had lower comp than engineering -- push for parity by emphasizing the strategic design investments Amazon is making.
