### Data Engineer | Amazon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Back-Loaded RSU Vesting / Signing Bonus Bridge | Data Infrastructure Scale

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Signing Bonus | Total Comp (Yr 1) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Seattle | $140K-$180K | $150K-$400K | $50K-$100K | $230K-$390K |
| Bay Area | $145K-$180K | $160K-$420K | $55K-$105K | $240K-$400K |
| NYC | $145K-$180K | $155K-$410K | $50K-$100K | $235K-$395K |
| Austin | $135K-$175K | $140K-$370K | $45K-$90K | $215K-$365K |

**CRITICAL: Amazon's Back-Loaded RSU Vesting Schedule**

Amazon's RSU vesting is unlike any other major tech company. Instead of the standard 25% per year, Amazon uses a **5/15/40/40** schedule:
- **Year 1:** Only 5% of RSUs vest
- **Year 2:** Only 15% of RSUs vest
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

To compensate for the low Year 1-2 vesting, Amazon provides **large signing bonuses** paid out in Year 1 and Year 2. This means your Year 1 and Year 2 cash comp is heavily dependent on the signing bonus, while Years 3-4 are driven by massive RSU vests. **Always negotiate the signing bonus AND the RSU grant as separate levers.**

**Negotiation DNA**

Amazon operates one of the largest data infrastructures on earth. Data Engineers at Amazon work across the entire ecosystem -- from AWS data services (Redshift, Glue, Athena, EMR, Kinesis, Lake Formation) to internal Amazon.com data pipelines that process petabytes of e-commerce, supply chain, and advertising data daily. The role spans multiple orgs: AWS product teams building data services for external customers, Amazon Retail data platforms, Ads data infrastructure, and the internal tooling teams. Amazon's data engineers are expected to be strong software engineers first, with data specialization second -- this is reflected in the SDE title most data engineers carry.

**Level Mapping:** Amazon L5 Data Engineer = Google L4 = Databricks Senior = Snowflake Senior

**Global Levers**

1. **Scale Frame:** "Amazon processes more transactional data than virtually any company on earth. I'm not building dashboards -- I'm building petabyte-scale data infrastructure that powers a $600B+ business. My comp should reflect infrastructure-engineer complexity, not analyst-level work."
2. **AWS Product Revenue Link:** If the role is on an AWS data service team (Redshift, Glue, EMR, etc.), you're building products that generate direct revenue: "I'm building the product that AWS customers pay for. Every improvement I make to Redshift performance directly impacts customer retention and usage revenue."
3. **Signing Bonus Bridge Negotiation:** "The 5/15/40/40 vesting schedule means my Year 1 effective equity comp is very low. I need the Year 1 signing bonus at $90K and Year 2 at $60K to make the total package competitive with Databricks/Snowflake, where I'd receive 25% of my equity in Year 1."
4. **Leadership Principle Framing:** Anchor to "Dive Deep" (data engineers must understand data at the most granular level), "Invent and Simplify" (building self-service data platforms), and "Frugality" (optimizing data pipeline costs at scale).

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $350K over 4 years, with Year 1 signing bonus of $85K and Year 2 at $55K. My experience building [specific pipeline/platform] at [current company] directly transfers to Amazon's data infrastructure needs at L5." Amazon will counter at $250K-$320K RSUs with $60K-$80K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if the total Year 1 comp (base + signing bonus + 5% RSU vest) exceeds $250K. Always compare Year 1 comp, not 4-year averages, because of the back-loading.
