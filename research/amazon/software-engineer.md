### Software Engineer (SDE I-II / L4-L5) | Amazon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Back-Loaded RSU Vesting / Signing Bonus Bridge | Volume Hire with Wide Comp Bands

| Level | Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Signing Bonus | Total Comp (Yr 1) |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| L4 SDE I | Seattle | $120K-$160K | $80K-$200K | $40K-$80K | $170K-$280K |
| L4 SDE I | Bay Area | $125K-$165K | $85K-$210K | $42K-$85K | $178K-$290K |
| L5 SDE II | Seattle | $140K-$180K | $120K-$350K | $50K-$100K | $220K-$370K |
| L5 SDE II | Bay Area | $145K-$180K | $130K-$370K | $55K-$105K | $230K-$380K |
| L5 SDE II | NYC | $145K-$180K | $125K-$360K | $50K-$100K | $225K-$375K |
| L5 SDE II | Austin | $135K-$175K | $110K-$320K | $45K-$90K | $205K-$345K |

**CRITICAL: Amazon's Back-Loaded RSU Vesting Schedule**

Amazon's RSU vesting is unlike any other major tech company. Instead of the standard 25% per year, Amazon uses a **5/15/40/40** schedule:
- **Year 1:** Only 5% of RSUs vest
- **Year 2:** Only 15% of RSUs vest
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

To compensate for the low Year 1-2 vesting, Amazon provides **large signing bonuses** paid out in Year 1 and Year 2. This means your Year 1 and Year 2 cash comp is heavily dependent on the signing bonus, while Years 3-4 are driven by massive RSU vests. **Always negotiate the signing bonus AND the RSU grant as separate levers.**

**How to Calculate Your Real Year 1 Comp:**
- Year 1 TC = Base + Year 1 Signing Bonus + (5% x Total RSU Grant)
- Year 2 TC = Base + Year 2 Signing Bonus + (15% x Total RSU Grant)
- Year 3 TC = Base + (40% x Total RSU Grant) -- no signing bonus, but massive equity vest
- Year 4 TC = Base + (40% x Total RSU Grant) + refreshes

**Negotiation DNA**

Amazon is one of the largest employers of software engineers in the world. SDE I (L4) and SDE II (L5) are the most common levels, with Amazon running multiple hiring pipelines simultaneously. The interview process includes a "Bar Raiser" -- a cross-functional interviewer whose sole job is ensuring the hire raises the team's average quality. If you passed the Bar Raiser, you have leverage: Amazon invested significant evaluation resources in you. Amazon's SDE roles span every product area: AWS services, Amazon.com retail, Alexa, Prime, Ring, Kuiper, Ads, Search, Supply Chain, Amazon Robotics, Zoox, and MGM Studios. **The team you're placed on matters enormously for both the work and the comp** -- AWS and Ads teams tend to offer at the higher end of the band.

**Level Mapping:**
- Amazon L4 SDE I = Google L3 = Meta E3 = Apple ICT2
- Amazon L5 SDE II = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Apple ICT3

**Global Levers**

1. **Team Placement Leverage:** After the interview loop, you'll be matched to teams. Express preferences and ask which teams are interested: "I'd like to join an AWS team working on [specific service]. I understand AWS teams may have different comp ranges." This creates internal competition for your placement.
2. **Signing Bonus is King for L4-L5:** At these levels, the signing bonus is often a higher percentage of Year 1 comp than at senior levels (because RSU grants are smaller but signing bonuses are still substantial). Push hard: "I need Year 1 signing bonus of $75K to make Year 1 competitive. With a $200K RSU grant, my Year 1 equity is only $10K -- the signing bonus IS my variable comp for Year 1."
3. **L4-to-L5 Uplevel Push:** If you're borderline L4/L5, push hard for L5. The difference in RSU grant can be $100K-$150K+ over 4 years. "My [X years] of experience and [specific system design / technical leadership] put me at the L5 bar. I'd like to discuss L5 compensation."
4. **Leadership Principle Alignment:** Even at L4-L5, LPs matter. Anchor to "Ownership" (taking end-to-end responsibility), "Bias for Action" (shipping quickly), and "Learn and Be Curious" (growth trajectory).

> **Negotiate Up Strategy (L5 SDE II):** "I'd like the RSU grant at $300K over 4 years, with Year 1 signing bonus of $85K and Year 2 at $55K. I have a competing offer from [Google/Meta] at [comparable level] where Year 1 TC is $X with uniform vesting." Amazon will counter at $220K-$280K RSUs with $60K-$80K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if Year 1 TC (base + signing bonus + 5% RSU vest) exceeds $240K for L5.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy (L4 SDE I):** "I'd like the RSU grant at $170K over 4 years, with Year 1 signing bonus of $65K. For L4, I know the base range is $120K-$160K, and I'd like base at $150K+." Amazon will counter at $120K-$160K RSUs with $45K-$60K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if Year 1 TC exceeds $210K for L4. At L4, prioritize getting the highest base possible because it compounds over time.
