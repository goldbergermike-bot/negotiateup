### AWS AI Platform Engineer (Bedrock) | Amazon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Back-Loaded RSU Vesting / Signing Bonus Bridge | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15-30% AI/ML PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Signing Bonus | Total Comp (Yr 1) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Seattle | $160K-$185K | $300K-$700K | $80K-$130K | $330K-$520K |
| Bay Area | $165K-$185K | $320K-$750K | $85K-$140K | $350K-$545K |
| NYC | $165K-$185K | $310K-$720K | $80K-$135K | $340K-$530K |

**CRITICAL: Amazon's Back-Loaded RSU Vesting Schedule**

Amazon's RSU vesting is unlike any other major tech company. Instead of the standard 25% per year, Amazon uses a **5/15/40/40** schedule:
- **Year 1:** Only 5% of RSUs vest
- **Year 2:** Only 15% of RSUs vest
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

To compensate for the low Year 1-2 vesting, Amazon provides **large signing bonuses** paid out in Year 1 and Year 2. This means your Year 1 and Year 2 cash comp is heavily dependent on the signing bonus, while Years 3-4 are driven by massive RSU vests. **Always negotiate the signing bonus AND the RSU grant as separate levers** -- they serve different purposes.

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Amazon's most strategically critical role for 2025-2026. AWS Bedrock is the company's answer to the generative AI platform wars, competing directly against Azure OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, and Anthropic's direct API. AWS generated over $100B in annual revenue in 2024, and Bedrock is positioned as the next major growth driver. Engineers building Bedrock's model serving infrastructure, fine-tuning pipelines, RAG systems, and agent orchestration capabilities are the highest-priority hires in all of AWS. Andy Jassy has publicly stated that AI is Amazon's largest investment priority. [Source: Amazon Q4 2024 Earnings Call]

**Level Mapping:** Amazon L6 Senior SDE (Bedrock) = Google L5 Senior = Meta E5 = Anthropic Senior

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The AWS AI Platform Engineer (Bedrock) builds systems at a scale no other AI platform matches:
- **Multi-Model Serving:** Designing infrastructure that serves Anthropic Claude, Meta Llama, Mistral, Stability AI, and Amazon Titan models through a unified API
- **Enterprise-Grade AI:** Building fine-tuning, guardrails, knowledge bases, and agent capabilities for Fortune 500 customers
- **Revenue-Direct Platform:** Every Bedrock API call generates direct usage revenue -- your code is literally the revenue engine
- **Massive Scale:** Serving AI inference across 30+ AWS regions with sub-100ms latency requirements

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue-Generating Platform Frame:** "Every API call through Bedrock generates direct consumption revenue. The infrastructure I build doesn't just support revenue -- it IS the revenue. My RSU grant should reflect the direct revenue attribution of this platform."
2. **AI Talent Scarcity Premium (15-30%):** "Engineers with production LLM serving experience at scale are the scarcest talent in tech. I'm not a general SDE -- I bring specialized AI infrastructure skills that command a market premium of 15-30% above standard SDE L6 bands."
3. **Competitive Offer Leverage:** Azure OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, and Anthropic are all hiring for identical roles. Amazon knows this. Frame: "I have active conversations with [Azure OpenAI / Google Cloud AI / Anthropic]. Their offers don't have back-loaded vesting, which means my Year 1-2 comp is significantly higher there. I need the signing bonus to bridge that gap competitively."
4. **Leadership Principle Alignment:** Use Amazon's own language. Frame your ask around "Customer Obsession" (building for enterprise customers), "Bias for Action" (shipping quickly), and "Think Big" (platform-level thinking). Recruiters are trained to evaluate candidates through LPs -- use them in your negotiation pitch.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building AWS's most strategically important platform. I'd like the RSU grant at $650K over 4 years, with a Year 1 signing bonus of $120K and Year 2 signing bonus of $80K to bridge the back-loaded vesting. I also want confirmation of the TCI (Total Compensation Increase) refresh policy for Bedrock engineers." Amazon will counter at $500K-$600K RSUs with $90K-$110K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if the total 4-year package exceeds $1.6M. Push hard on the signing bonus -- it's the most flexible lever because it's cash, not equity.
