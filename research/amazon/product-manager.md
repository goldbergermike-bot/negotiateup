### Product Manager Technical (PMT) | Amazon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Back-Loaded RSU Vesting / Signing Bonus Bridge | Technical PM Culture (PMT, Not PM)

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Signing Bonus | Total Comp (Yr 1) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Seattle | $160K-$185K | $250K-$600K | $60K-$110K | $300K-$480K |
| Bay Area | $165K-$185K | $270K-$630K | $65K-$115K | $315K-$495K |
| NYC | $165K-$185K | $260K-$620K | $60K-$110K | $305K-$490K |
| Arlington VA | $155K-$180K | $230K-$560K | $55K-$100K | $280K-$455K |

**CRITICAL: Amazon's Back-Loaded RSU Vesting Schedule**

Amazon's RSU vesting is unlike any other major tech company. Instead of the standard 25% per year, Amazon uses a **5/15/40/40** schedule:
- **Year 1:** Only 5% of RSUs vest
- **Year 2:** Only 15% of RSUs vest
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

To compensate for the low Year 1-2 vesting, Amazon provides **large signing bonuses** paid out in Year 1 and Year 2. This means your Year 1 and Year 2 cash comp is heavily dependent on the signing bonus, while Years 3-4 are driven by massive RSU vests. **Always negotiate the signing bonus AND the RSU grant as separate levers.**

**Negotiation DNA**

Amazon calls their Product Managers "PMTs" -- Product Manager Technical. The "Technical" suffix is not decorative. Amazon PMTs are expected to write SQL, read code, understand system architecture, and go deep on technical trade-offs. The PMT role at Amazon is arguably the most technically demanding PM role in big tech. PMTs own the "working backwards" process -- starting with the customer press release and working backward to the technical solution. Amazon PMTs at L6 own multi-year product roadmaps, write 6-page narrative documents (not slide decks), and drive alignment across engineering, design, science, and business teams. The narrative writing culture means PMTs need exceptional written communication skills -- this is tested in the interview loop and is a negotiation asset. [Source: Amazon PMT Job Family 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Amazon PMT L6 = Google L5 PM = Meta PM IC5 = Stripe PM

**What Makes This Role Unique**

Amazon PMTs operate differently from PMs at other tech companies:
- **6-Pagers, Not Slide Decks:** All major decisions are driven by 6-page narrative documents read silently at the start of meetings
- **Working Backwards Process:** Product development starts with a press release and FAQ, then works backward to the technical solution
- **Technical Depth Required:** PMTs are expected to understand system design, read code, and make technical trade-offs
- **Single-Threaded Ownership:** Each PMT owns their product area end-to-end with full P&L-like accountability

**Global Levers**

1. **Technical PM Premium:** "Amazon's PMT role requires deeper technical skills than PM roles at other companies. I bring [SQL/system design/API expertise] in addition to product skills, which is the intersection that defines the PMT bar. My comp should reflect the dual technical + product skill set."
2. **AWS vs. Retail Product Scope:** AWS PMTs often command higher comp because AWS products are externally revenue-generating. If you're on an AWS team: "I'm PMing an AWS service that generates direct customer revenue. Every product decision I make has immediate P&L impact."
3. **Signing Bonus Competitive Bridge:** "Google and Meta PM offers provide 25% equity vesting in Year 1 with no back-loading. I need Year 1 signing bonus of $100K and Year 2 of $65K to make the first two years competitive. This is a bridge, not a premium."
4. **Leadership Principle Mastery:** PMTs are evaluated against all 16 Leadership Principles, with particular emphasis on "Customer Obsession" (working backwards from the customer), "Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit" (driving product decisions through disagreement), and "Ownership" (single-threaded product ownership).

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting an RSU grant of $540K over 4 years, with Year 1 signing bonus of $100K and Year 2 at $65K. My track record of [specific product launches/metrics] and my technical depth (I can read code and write SQL) positions me at the top of the L6 PMT band." Amazon will counter at $380K-$500K RSUs with $75K-$95K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if Year 1 TC exceeds $310K. If the role is AWS-facing with direct revenue responsibility, push 10-15% above these numbers. Ask about the PMT refresh policy -- AWS PMTs who deliver strong results get above-average refreshes.
