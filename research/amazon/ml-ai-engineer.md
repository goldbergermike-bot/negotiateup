### ML/AI Engineer (Applied Scientist) | Amazon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Back-Loaded RSU Vesting / Signing Bonus Bridge | **+10-25% AI/ML PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Signing Bonus | Total Comp (Yr 1) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Seattle | $155K-$185K | $250K-$650K | $70K-$120K | $310K-$500K |
| Bay Area | $160K-$185K | $270K-$700K | $75K-$130K | $325K-$520K |
| NYC | $160K-$185K | $260K-$680K | $70K-$125K | $320K-$510K |
| Austin | $150K-$180K | $230K-$600K | $65K-$110K | $290K-$470K |

**CRITICAL: Amazon's Back-Loaded RSU Vesting Schedule**

Amazon's RSU vesting is unlike any other major tech company. Instead of the standard 25% per year, Amazon uses a **5/15/40/40** schedule:
- **Year 1:** Only 5% of RSUs vest
- **Year 2:** Only 15% of RSUs vest
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

To compensate for the low Year 1-2 vesting, Amazon provides **large signing bonuses** paid out in Year 1 and Year 2. This means your Year 1 and Year 2 cash comp is heavily dependent on the signing bonus, while Years 3-4 are driven by massive RSU vests. **Always negotiate the signing bonus AND the RSU grant as separate levers.**

**Negotiation DNA**

Amazon has one of the largest ML/AI organizations in the world, spanning AWS AI services (Bedrock, SageMaker, Rekognition, Comprehend), Alexa AI, Amazon Search ranking, Ads ML, supply chain optimization, robotics (Amazon Robotics), and autonomous vehicles (Zoox). Amazon distinguishes between "Applied Scientists" (PhD-preferred, research + production ML) and "ML Engineers" (SDE title, production ML systems). Applied Scientists sit on a separate, higher comp band. If your role involves model architecture design, training, or novel ML approaches, push for the Applied Scientist title. If your role is ML infrastructure, model serving, and pipeline engineering, you'll be on the SDE band but can push for the AI/ML premium. [Source: Amazon AI/ML Job Family 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Amazon L6 Applied Scientist = Google L5 Research Scientist = Meta Research Scientist E5 = DeepMind Senior Researcher

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Talent War Premium:** "ML/AI engineers with production experience are the most contested talent in tech. I have active interest from [Anthropic/OpenAI/Google DeepMind/Meta FAIR], where equity vests uniformly and comp bands are 15-25% higher. Amazon's signing bonus needs to bridge the gap, and the RSU grant needs to reflect the AI premium."
2. **Applied Scientist Title Push:** If your work involves any model development, push hard for the Applied Scientist classification: "Given that my role involves [model architecture / training pipeline / novel ML approach], I believe the Applied Scientist band is more appropriate. I'd like to discuss comp in that context -- the AS band at L6 is materially higher."
3. **Amazon-Specific ML Impact:** Quantify the business impact of ML at Amazon: "Amazon's recommendation engine drives 35% of revenue. Alexa serves hundreds of millions of users. My ML expertise will directly impact [specific product area], and the comp should reflect the revenue magnitude."
4. **Leadership Principle Alignment:** Anchor to "Learn and Be Curious" (continuous ML research), "Invent and Simplify" (novel model architectures), and "Think Big" (AI transformation across the company).

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $580K over 4 years with the AI/ML premium applied, with Year 1 signing bonus of $110K and Year 2 at $70K. I have competing offers from [AI lab / tech company] where Year 1 TC exceeds $400K with uniform vesting. I need Amazon's package to be competitive on a Year 1 basis, not just a 4-year average." Amazon will counter at $400K-$520K RSUs with $80K-$100K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if Year 1 TC exceeds $330K and you receive the Applied Scientist title. If they won't budge on AS title, demand the signing bonus be at the top of the range to compensate.
