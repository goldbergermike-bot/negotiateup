### Senior Software Engineer (SDE III / L6) | Amazon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Back-Loaded RSU Vesting / Signing Bonus Bridge | L6 is the Career Level

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Signing Bonus | Total Comp (Yr 1) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Seattle | $160K-$185K | $250K-$700K | $60K-$120K | $330K-$520K |
| Bay Area | $165K-$185K | $270K-$730K | $65K-$130K | $345K-$540K |
| NYC | $165K-$185K | $260K-$720K | $65K-$125K | $340K-$535K |
| Austin | $155K-$180K | $230K-$650K | $55K-$110K | $310K-$490K |

**CRITICAL: Amazon's Back-Loaded RSU Vesting Schedule**

Amazon's RSU vesting is unlike any other major tech company. Instead of the standard 25% per year, Amazon uses a **5/15/40/40** schedule:
- **Year 1:** Only 5% of RSUs vest
- **Year 2:** Only 15% of RSUs vest
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

To compensate for the low Year 1-2 vesting, Amazon provides **large signing bonuses** paid out in Year 1 and Year 2. This means your Year 1 and Year 2 cash comp is heavily dependent on the signing bonus, while Years 3-4 are driven by massive RSU vests. **Always negotiate the signing bonus AND the RSU grant as separate levers.**

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SDE (L6 / SDE III) is the "terminal level" at Amazon -- the level where the majority of senior engineers spend their career. It's also the most competitive level to negotiate because Amazon hires the most L6 SDEs and has the widest comp bands. At L6, Amazon's base salary cap becomes very real: most L6 SDEs are capped around $175K-$185K base regardless of location. This means **the RSU grant and signing bonus are where the real negotiation happens**. L6 SDEs at Amazon own the technical design of their team's systems, mentor junior engineers, drive operational excellence, and are expected to influence beyond their immediate team. The L5-to-L6 promotion internally is one of the hardest in tech, which means external L6 hires have significant leverage -- Amazon would rather pay a premium for external L6 talent than wait 2-3 years for an internal L5 to promote.

**Level Mapping:** Amazon L6 Senior SDE = Google L5 Senior = Meta E5 Senior = Apple ICT4 = Netflix Senior

**Key Insight: The Base Cap Reality**

Amazon's base salary is effectively capped at approximately $175K-$185K for L6. Unlike Google or Meta, where base salaries can reach $250K+ at senior levels, Amazon keeps base low and shifts compensation into equity. This means:
- **Don't waste negotiation energy on base** -- it has a hard ceiling
- **RSU grant is your #1 lever** -- the spread between low and high L6 offers can be $400K+ in equity
- **Signing bonus is your #2 lever** -- this is pure cash that bridges the Year 1-2 equity gap
- **Refreshes matter enormously** -- top performers get Year 2-3 refreshes that can double the effective annual equity vest

**Global Levers**

1. **L6 External Hire Premium:** "Amazon's L5-to-L6 internal promotion rate is notoriously low. By hiring me externally at L6, Amazon is avoiding 2-3 years of development time and the organizational risk of a failed promotion cycle. That premium should be reflected in the RSU grant."
2. **Team/Org Bidding War:** L6 SDEs often have multiple teams interested in them after the interview loop. Ask your recruiter: "Which teams are interested in me? I'd like to understand the team match options." If multiple teams want you, this creates internal competition that can push RSU offers higher.
3. **Signing Bonus Year-by-Year Negotiation:** "I need Year 1 signing bonus at $110K and Year 2 at $70K. Here's why: with 5% Year 1 RSU vesting on a $600K grant, my Year 1 equity is only $30K. The signing bonus needs to make Year 1 TC competitive with my Google/Meta offers where Year 1 equity alone would be $150K+."
4. **Leadership Principle Alignment:** L6 SDEs are evaluated heavily on "Ownership" (you own your team's systems end-to-end), "Dive Deep" (technical depth and root-cause analysis), and "Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit" (driving technical decisions through influence).

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting an RSU grant of $620K over 4 years, with Year 1 signing bonus of $110K and Year 2 at $70K. I bring L6-caliber system design and technical leadership experience from [current company], and I know this is at the top of the L6 band -- but my competing offers at [Google/Meta/Netflix] justify this position." Amazon will counter at $450K-$580K RSUs with $80K-$100K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if the 4-year total comp exceeds $1.5M and Year 1 TC exceeds $340K. Always calculate Year 1 TC separately: Base + Year 1 Signing Bonus + (5% x RSU Grant). That Year 1 number is what you'll actually earn.
