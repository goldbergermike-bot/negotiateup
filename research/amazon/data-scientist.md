**Negotiation DNA:** Back-Loaded RSU Vesting / Signing Bonus Bridge | Experimentation & Causal Inference Focus

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Signing Bonus | Total Comp (Yr 1) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Seattle | $140K-$180K | $150K-$400K | $50K-$100K | $230K-$390K |
| Bay Area | $150K-$185K | $170K-$430K | $55K-$110K | $245K-$410K |
| NYC | $145K-$185K | $160K-$420K | $55K-$105K | $240K-$400K |
| Arlington VA | $140K-$175K | $140K-$380K | $45K-$90K | $220K-$370K |

**CRITICAL: Amazon's Back-Loaded RSU Vesting Schedule**

Amazon's RSU vesting is unlike any other major tech company. Instead of the standard 25% per year, Amazon uses a **5/15/40/40** schedule:
- **Year 1:** Only 5% of RSUs vest
- **Year 2:** Only 15% of RSUs vest
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

To compensate for the low Year 1-2 vesting, Amazon provides **large signing bonuses** paid out in Year 1 and Year 2. This means your Year 1 and Year 2 cash comp is heavily dependent on the signing bonus, while Years 3-4 are driven by massive RSU vests. **Always negotiate the signing bonus AND the RSU grant as separate levers.**

**Negotiation DNA**

Amazon is one of the most data-driven companies in existence. Data Scientists at Amazon are deeply embedded in business decisions -- from pricing optimization and demand forecasting to Alexa NLU, advertising attribution, Prime engagement modeling, and supply chain optimization. Amazon distinguishes between "Applied Scientists" (more ML-focused, higher comp) and "Data Scientists" (more analytics/causal inference-focused). Make sure you understand which track your offer falls under. Amazon's data science bar is notoriously high -- the loop includes a "Bar Raiser" interview specifically designed to filter candidates. If you passed the bar, you're already in a strong negotiation position. [Source: Amazon Data Science Job Family 2025]

**Global Levers**

1. **Business Impact Quantification:** Amazon expects data scientists to quantify their impact in dollar terms. Frame your negotiation the same way: "My pricing optimization models at [current company] generated $XM in incremental revenue. I expect to deliver similar magnitude impact at Amazon, and the comp should reflect that expected value."
2. **Applied Scientist Reclassification:** If your role involves significant ML model building (not just analysis), push for Applied Scientist classification, which carries a higher comp band. "Given the ML modeling component of this role, I believe the Applied Scientist band is more appropriate, and I'd like to discuss comp in that context."
3. **Signing Bonus as Year 1-2 Equalizer:** "Competing offers from Meta and Google give me 25% equity vesting in Year 1. With Amazon's 5% Year 1 vest, I need a signing bonus of $95K to achieve parity. This isn't an ask above market -- it's bridging to market."
4. **Leadership Principle Alignment:** Anchor to "Dive Deep" (rigorous statistical methodology), "Are Right, A Lot" (data-driven decision making), and "Customer Obsession" (using data to improve customer experience).

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $380K over 4 years, with Year 1 signing bonus of $90K and Year 2 at $55K. My causal inference and experimentation expertise is directly applicable to Amazon's culture of A/B testing and data-driven decision-making at L5." Amazon will counter at $280K-$350K RSUs with $65K-$85K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if Year 1 TC (base + signing bonus + 5% RSU vest) exceeds $260K. If they offer Applied Scientist title, accept a slightly lower signing bonus -- the long-term band and refreshes will be significantly higher.
