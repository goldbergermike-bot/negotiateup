### Security Engineer | Amazon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Back-Loaded RSU Vesting / Signing Bonus Bridge | World's Largest Attack Surface

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Signing Bonus | Total Comp (Yr 1) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Seattle | $155K-$185K | $200K-$500K | $60K-$110K | $290K-$450K |
| Bay Area | $160K-$185K | $220K-$530K | $65K-$115K | $305K-$470K |
| NYC | $160K-$185K | $210K-$520K | $60K-$110K | $295K-$460K |
| Arlington VA | $155K-$185K | $200K-$510K | $60K-$110K | $290K-$455K |

**CRITICAL: Amazon's Back-Loaded RSU Vesting Schedule**

Amazon's RSU vesting is unlike any other major tech company. Instead of the standard 25% per year, Amazon uses a **5/15/40/40** schedule:
- **Year 1:** Only 5% of RSUs vest
- **Year 2:** Only 15% of RSUs vest
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

To compensate for the low Year 1-2 vesting, Amazon provides **large signing bonuses** paid out in Year 1 and Year 2. This means your Year 1 and Year 2 cash comp is heavily dependent on the signing bonus, while Years 3-4 are driven by massive RSU vests. **Always negotiate the signing bonus AND the RSU grant as separate levers.**

**Negotiation DNA**

Amazon operates what may be the world's largest attack surface: AWS serves millions of customers including government and financial institutions, Amazon.com processes billions of transactions, Alexa sits in millions of homes, Ring manages home security cameras, and Kuiper will serve satellite internet. Security Engineers at Amazon don't just protect Amazon -- they protect the infrastructure that the internet runs on. AWS security is a revenue driver, not a cost center: security certifications (FedRAMP, SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) are prerequisites for enterprise and government customers to use AWS. Amazon's security org spans AppSec, InfraSec, Cloud Security, Threat Intelligence, Incident Response, and the specialized AWS security services teams (GuardDuty, Security Hub, IAM, KMS, Macie). Arlington VA is a particularly strong location due to proximity to DoD and intelligence community customers. [Source: Amazon Security Engineering 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Amazon L6 Security Engineer = Google L5 Security = CrowdStrike Senior = Palo Alto Networks Senior

**Global Levers**

1. **Attack Surface Scale Frame:** "Amazon's attack surface spans AWS (the world's largest cloud), Amazon.com (one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms), Alexa, Ring, and soon Kuiper. I'm not protecting one product -- I'm protecting infrastructure that millions of businesses and hundreds of millions of consumers depend on. The scope of responsibility demands top-of-band comp."
2. **Revenue-Enabling Security:** "Every AWS security certification I help maintain (FedRAMP, SOC 2, HIPAA) directly enables billions in enterprise and government revenue. Security at Amazon isn't a cost center -- it's a revenue prerequisite. My comp should reflect this revenue-enabling role."
3. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers with cloud-scale experience are among the scarcest talent in tech. I have competing interest from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto/Wiz/Google], where equity vests uniformly. I need the signing bonus at $100K Year 1 to bridge the back-loaded vesting gap."
4. **Leadership Principle Alignment:** Anchor to "Earn Trust" (security is fundamentally about trust), "Insist on the Highest Standards" (zero-compromise security posture), and "Customer Obsession" (protecting customer data is the ultimate expression of customer obsession).

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $450K over 4 years, with Year 1 signing bonus of $100K and Year 2 at $65K. My experience in [cloud security / AppSec / threat detection] at [current company] maps directly to Amazon's security needs. The Arlington VA location also positions me for government security work, which carries a premium." Amazon will counter at $330K-$420K RSUs with $75K-$95K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if Year 1 TC exceeds $300K. If the role is on an AWS security product team (GuardDuty, Security Hub), push 10% higher -- you're building the product, not just consuming it.
