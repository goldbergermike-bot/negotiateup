### Engineering Manager (SDM) | Amazon Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Back-Loaded RSU Vesting / Signing Bonus Bridge | Leadership Principles-Driven Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Signing Bonus | Total Comp (Yr 1) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Seattle | $165K-$190K | $300K-$700K | $80K-$130K | $380K-$580K |
| Bay Area | $170K-$190K | $320K-$720K | $85K-$135K | $395K-$595K |
| NYC | $170K-$190K | $310K-$710K | $80K-$130K | $385K-$585K |
| Arlington VA | $160K-$185K | $280K-$650K | $75K-$120K | $360K-$550K |

**CRITICAL: Amazon's Back-Loaded RSU Vesting Schedule**

Amazon's RSU vesting is unlike any other major tech company. Instead of the standard 25% per year, Amazon uses a **5/15/40/40** schedule:
- **Year 1:** Only 5% of RSUs vest
- **Year 2:** Only 15% of RSUs vest
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

To compensate for the low Year 1-2 vesting, Amazon provides **large signing bonuses** paid out in Year 1 and Year 2. **For SDM (Software Development Manager) roles, signing bonuses are typically larger** because the expectation is that managers stay long enough to reach the lucrative Year 3-4 vesting cliff. **Always negotiate the signing bonus AND the RSU grant as separate levers.**

**Negotiation DNA**

Amazon calls their Engineering Managers "SDMs" (Software Development Managers). The SDM role at Amazon is one of the most demanding EM positions in tech -- you own hiring, team performance, operational metrics (severity tracking, on-call health, deployment frequency), and are expected to be deeply technical. Amazon SDMs at L6 typically manage 8-15 direct reports and are responsible for the operational health of their team's services. The "two-pizza team" structure means SDMs own end-to-end delivery for their service area. Amazon's stack ranking and PIP culture means SDMs carry significant organizational risk and responsibility -- your negotiation leverage should reflect this. SDMs are also evaluated on all 16 Leadership Principles during the interview loop, making the cultural bar as high as the technical bar. [Source: Amazon SDM Job Family 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Amazon SDM L6 = Google L5 Manager = Meta M1 = Stripe EM = Apple ICT5 Manager

**Global Levers**

1. **Organizational Leverage Frame:** "As an SDM, I'm responsible for the hiring, retention, and performance management of a team that directly ships revenue-impacting features. Every attrition event on my team costs Amazon 6-12 months of productivity and $200K+ in recruiting costs. My comp should reflect the organizational leverage I carry."
2. **Operational Ownership Premium:** Amazon SDMs own the operational health of their services -- including on-call rotations, SEV management, and availability targets. "I'm not just managing people -- I'm on the hook for service availability that impacts millions of customers. That operational risk premium should be reflected in the RSU grant."
3. **Signing Bonus Maximization:** SDMs have strong leverage on signing bonuses because Amazon knows managers who make it to Year 3-4 drive enormous value through team stability. "I'd like Year 1 signing bonus at $120K and Year 2 at $80K. Amazon's retention data shows that managers who stay through Year 3 deliver the highest team velocity -- the signing bonus is Amazon's investment in that retention."
4. **Leadership Principle Mastery:** SDMs are evaluated against ALL 16 Leadership Principles. In negotiation, anchor to "Hire and Develop the Best" (you'll be building the team), "Deliver Results" (you own team output), and "Earn Trust" (managing up and across).

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting total Year 1 comp of $450K, which requires the RSU grant at $600K over 4 years with Year 1 signing bonus of $115K and Year 2 at $75K. My experience managing [X]-person teams shipping [specific system/feature] at [current company] demonstrates the L6 SDM bar. I also want to understand the refresh policy for SDMs -- specifically, how are Year 3-4 refreshes calibrated against the initial grant?" Amazon will counter at $450K-$550K RSUs with $90K-$110K Year 1 signing bonus. Accept if Year 1 TC exceeds $380K and the 4-year total exceeds $1.8M. The refresh question signals you're thinking long-term, which Amazon values.
