### Senior Software Engineer | GitLab Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($8B Market Cap) | All-Remote | DevSecOps Platform | Transparent Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| US (All-Remote) | $165K–$225K | $80K–$210K | 10% | $220K–$340K |
| San Francisco Benchmark | $170K–$230K | $85K–$215K | 10% | $225K–$350K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at GitLab own significant subsystems of the DevSecOps platform. GitLab's open-source codebase and all-remote culture mean contributions are visible to the entire community. Senior engineers at GitLab have significant architectural influence and are expected to contribute to GitLab's famous handbook and engineering practices documentation. The transparent comp calculator provides a clear baseline, but top performers should push above the calculated range. [Source: GitLab Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** GitLab Senior SWE = GitHub Senior SWE = Google L4 = Atlassian Senior SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Top-of-Band Placement:** "I've reviewed GitLab's compensation calculator. At senior level with my experience, I should be at the very top of the range."
2. **Open-Source Platform Leadership:** "My contributions to GitLab's open-source platform are visible to the entire developer community. This public technical leadership has brand value."
3. **GitHub/Atlassian Counter:** "GitHub (Microsoft) and Atlassian both pay senior engineers competitively. GitLab needs to match to retain against these competitors."
4. **GitLab Duo AI Work:** If working on GitLab Duo AI features, push for AI premium: "I'm building AI features that directly compete with GitHub Copilot."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $200K over 4 years at top of band. I'm owning core platform subsystems and I have competing offers from GitHub and Atlassian." Counter at $170K-$195K RSUs is strong.
