**Negotiation DNA**

TPMs at GitLab coordinate cross-functional programs across an all-remote engineering organization. This is a fundamentally different TPM challenge: all coordination is async, all stakeholder management is written, and all status updates are documented publicly in GitLab issues and epics. Key programs include GitLab releases (monthly release cadence), GitLab Duo AI feature launches, security compliance certifications, and platform scalability improvements. GitLab's transparent handbook documents program management practices publicly. [Source: GitLab TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** GitLab Senior TPM = GitHub Senior TPM = Google L5 TPM = Atlassian Senior TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Async Program Management:** "Managing cross-functional programs in an all-remote, async-first environment is harder than in-person program management. All coordination is written, all decisions are documented, and all status is public."
2. **Monthly Release Cadence:** "GitLab ships monthly releases on a predictable cadence. Managing this release program across a global all-remote team requires exceptional coordination."
3. **Public Program Execution:** "GitLab's transparent culture means my program execution is visible to the entire community. This public accountability is unique."
4. **Google/GitHub TPM Counter:** Both offer competitive TPM comp. Push for top of band.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $165K over 4 years. All-remote async program management is a specialized skill, and I have TPM offers from GitHub and Google." Counter at $135K-$160K RSUs is competitive.
