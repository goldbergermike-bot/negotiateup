### Product Designer | GitLab Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($8B Market Cap) | All-Remote | DevSecOps Platform | Transparent Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| US (All-Remote) | $135K–$195K | $45K–$155K | 10% | $170K–$275K |
| San Francisco Benchmark | $140K–$200K | $50K–$160K | 10% | $175K–$285K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at GitLab design the UX for a platform that spans the entire software development lifecycle. The design challenge is enormous: creating a coherent, usable experience that integrates source management, CI/CD, security, monitoring, and deployment in a single application. GitLab's Pajamas Design System provides the design language. All-remote design work requires strong async communication and written design documentation. [Source: GitLab Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** GitLab Senior Designer = GitHub Senior Designer = Atlassian Senior Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Full-SDLC Design Scope:** "Designing a single application that covers the entire SDLC is one of the most complex UX challenges in developer tools. No other platform requires this breadth."
2. **AI Interface Design:** If designing GitLab Duo AI interfaces, push for AI premium: "Designing AI-powered DevSecOps interfaces is a nascent discipline."
3. **All-Remote Design Collaboration:** "Designing effectively in an all-remote environment requires mastery of async design critique, written design proposals, and remote user research."
4. **Figma/Atlassian Counter:** Both offer competitive design comp. Push for top of band.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $150K over 4 years. I'm designing UX that spans the entire SDLC in a single application — a scope impossible at any other company." Counter at $120K-$145K RSUs is competitive.
