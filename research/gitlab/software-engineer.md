### Software Engineer | GitLab Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($8B Market Cap) | All-Remote | DevSecOps Platform | Transparent Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| US (All-Remote) | $140K–$200K | $50K–$170K | 10% | $175K–$290K |
| San Francisco Benchmark | $145K–$205K | $55K–$175K | 10% | $180K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

GitLab is a public all-remote DevSecOps company (NASDAQ: GTLB, ~$8B market cap) with ~2,000 employees worldwide. SWEs build the unified platform that competes with GitHub (Microsoft). GitLab's radical transparency includes a publicly available compensation calculator with location-based pay adjustments, experience multipliers, and level-based bands. This transparency is a double-edged sword: you can research bands beforehand, but GitLab will point to the calculator during negotiation. The key is pushing for top-of-band placement and arguing that the calculator should be a floor, not a ceiling. [Source: GitLab SWE Comp Data 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** GitLab SWE = GitHub SWE = Google L3 = Atlassian SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Transparent Comp Floor:** "GitLab's compensation calculator is transparent, and I've reviewed it. I expect to be placed at the top of band for my level, with the SF benchmark as my reference point regardless of location."
2. **All-Remote Productivity:** "All-remote work at GitLab means I'm optimizing for output, not hours-in-office. My productivity is measurable and results-driven."
3. **GitHub/Microsoft Counter:** "GitHub engineers receive Microsoft RSUs, which are among the most stable in tech. GitLab needs to be competitive against this."
4. **Location Factor Challenge:** If GitLab applies a location discount, push back: "My work output is identical regardless of location. The market for my skills is global, not local."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $165K over 4 years, placed at top of band. GitLab's calculator shows the range — I expect the top. I have a GitHub offer with Microsoft RSUs for reference." Counter at $130K-$155K RSUs is competitive.
