### Security Engineer | GitLab Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($8B Market Cap) | All-Remote | DevSecOps Platform | Security = Product

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| US (All-Remote) | $155K–$215K | $65K–$190K | 10% | $195K–$320K |
| San Francisco Benchmark | $160K–$220K | $70K–$195K | 10% | $200K–$330K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at GitLab have a dual mandate: securing the GitLab platform itself AND building the security scanning features that customers use (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, container scanning). The "Sec" in DevSecOps is a core product capability, not just an internal function. This dual role — internal security + product security features — is unique to GitLab. The company handles source code for millions of developers, making platform security existentially important. [Source: GitLab Security Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** GitLab Senior Security Eng = GitHub Security Eng = CrowdStrike Senior Eng = Google L4 Security

**Global Levers**

1. **Security = Product:** "At GitLab, security engineering IS product engineering. My SAST, DAST, and vulnerability scanning features are core product capabilities that customers pay for."
2. **Source Code Protection:** "GitLab hosts source code for millions of developers. A platform security breach would compromise the software supply chain of thousands of companies."
3. **DevSecOps Category Leadership:** "GitLab coined 'DevSecOps.' My security features define the category and set the standard for the entire industry."
4. **CrowdStrike/Snyk Counter:** Security companies offer premium comp. Push GitLab RSUs higher: "I have offers from security-focused companies with higher comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $185K over 4 years. At GitLab, security engineering is both internal security AND product engineering. This dual mandate justifies top-of-band comp." Counter at $155K-$175K RSUs is competitive.
