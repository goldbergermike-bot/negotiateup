### Staff Software Engineer | GitLab Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($8B Market Cap) | All-Remote | DevSecOps Platform | Transparent Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Engineers at GitLab are the technical architects who define the platform's technical direction across the entire SDLC. In an all-remote company, Staff Engineers lead through written communication, async decision-making, and architectural RFCs — skills that are different from in-person tech lead roles. GitLab's public handbook documents the Staff Engineer expectations in detail. Staff Engineers at GitLab have unique visibility through the open-source codebase and public engineering practices.

**Level Mapping:** GitLab Staff SWE = GitHub Staff SWE = Google L5 = Atlassian Staff SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Async Technical Leadership:** "Staff engineering at an all-remote company requires mastery of async technical leadership — written RFCs, public architectural decisions, and community-visible contributions. This is a harder leadership model than in-person."
2. **Platform Architecture Scope:** "At Staff level, my architectural decisions span the entire DevSecOps lifecycle — from source management through CI/CD to deployment and monitoring."
3. **GitHub/Google Staff Counter:** Both offer competitive Staff-level comp. Push for top of band: "My Google L5 offer is at $500K+ TC. GitLab needs to be within range."
4. **Open-Source Reputation:** "My public contributions to GitLab's open-source platform build my professional reputation and GitLab's brand simultaneously."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $420K total comp with RSUs at $300K over 4 years. Staff-level all-remote technical leadership is rare, and I have Google/GitHub offers." Counter at $260K-$290K RSUs is competitive.
