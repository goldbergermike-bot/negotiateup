### DevSecOps Platform Engineer | GitLab Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($8B Market Cap) | All-Remote | DevSecOps Platform | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | Transparent Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| US (All-Remote) | $155K–$220K | $65K–$190K | 10% | $195K–$325K |
| San Francisco Benchmark | $160K–$225K | $70K–$195K | 10% | $200K–$335K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is GitLab's signature engineering role. DevSecOps Platform Engineers build the unified DevSecOps platform that spans the entire software development lifecycle — from planning and source code management to CI/CD, security scanning, monitoring, and deployment. GitLab is public (NASDAQ: GTLB, ~$8B market cap) and famously all-remote with ~2,000 employees worldwide. GitLab practices radical transparency — including a publicly available compensation calculator and handbook. This transparency means you can research comp bands before negotiating. GitLab competes directly with GitHub (Microsoft) for developer platform market share. [Source: GitLab DevSecOps Platform Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** GitLab DevSecOps Eng (Senior) = GitHub Senior SWE = Google L4 = Atlassian Senior SWE

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The DevSecOps Platform Engineer works across GitLab's single-application platform:
- **Source Code Management:** Git repository hosting, merge requests, code review
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated build, test, and deployment infrastructure
- **Security Scanning:** SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, container scanning integrated into the pipeline
- **GitLab Duo (AI):** AI-powered code suggestions, vulnerability explanation, and DevSecOps automation
- **Infrastructure as Code:** GitLab's built-in infrastructure management capabilities

**Global Levers**

1. **Single-Platform Architecture:** "GitLab is the only DevSecOps platform that covers the entire SDLC in a single application. I'm building an integrated platform, not a feature within a suite. This architectural complexity justifies premium comp."
2. **All-Remote Comp Transparency:** "GitLab publishes its compensation calculator. I've researched the bands and I expect to be at the top of the range for my level, location factor, and experience."
3. **GitHub/Microsoft Competition:** "GitLab competes directly with GitHub, which is backed by Microsoft's resources. Attracting top talent against Microsoft requires competitive comp."
4. **GitLab Duo AI Premium:** If working on GitLab Duo (AI features), push for AI premium: "I'm building AI-powered DevSecOps features that compete with GitHub Copilot. This is the highest-priority competitive battleground."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $315K total comp with RSUs at $185K over 4 years. This is GitLab's defining role — I'm building the single-platform DevSecOps system that competes with GitHub/Microsoft. I have a GitHub offer with Microsoft RSUs." Counter at $155K-$175K RSUs is competitive.
