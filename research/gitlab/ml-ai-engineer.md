### ML / AI Engineer | GitLab Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($8B Market Cap) | All-Remote | DevSecOps Platform | **+15–25% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| US (All-Remote) | $160K–$225K | $70K–$200K | 10% | $205K–$340K |
| San Francisco Benchmark | $165K–$230K | $75K–$205K | 10% | $210K–$350K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at GitLab build GitLab Duo — the AI-powered DevSecOps assistant that competes directly with GitHub Copilot. GitLab Duo includes AI code suggestions, code review automation, vulnerability explanation, merge request summaries, and DevSecOps workflow automation. This is GitLab's highest-priority competitive battleground. GitHub Copilot (powered by OpenAI) has significant market share, and GitLab Duo must match or exceed its capabilities. ML/AI engineers building Duo are among the most strategically important people at the company. [Source: GitLab ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** GitLab ML/AI Eng = GitHub Copilot ML Eng = Google L4 ML = Anthropic ML Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **GitHub Copilot Competition:** "GitLab Duo competes directly with GitHub Copilot, which is backed by Microsoft and OpenAI. My work determines whether GitLab wins or loses the AI DevOps battle. This is existentially important."
2. **AI Premium Justification:** "The AI talent market is the tightest in tech. GitLab needs to pay a 15-25% AI premium to attract ML engineers who could work at OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google."
3. **Full-Stack AI DevSecOps:** "Building AI features that span the entire DevSecOps lifecycle — from code suggestions to security scanning to deployment automation — is uniquely complex."
4. **OpenAI/Anthropic/Google Counter:** "I have ML offers at $400K+ TC from AI-native companies. GitLab needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $330K total comp with RSUs at $195K over 4 years. I'm building GitLab Duo to compete with GitHub Copilot — this is GitLab's most important competitive initiative." Counter at $160K-$185K RSUs is competitive.
