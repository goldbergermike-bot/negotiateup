**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at GitLab help enterprise customers deploy the DevSecOps platform — configuring CI/CD pipelines, security scanning, and development workflows. GitLab SAs work entirely remotely, which requires strong async communication and self-directed customer engagement. SAs play a critical role in converting enterprises from GitHub to GitLab and migrating customers from DIY DevOps tool chains to GitLab's unified platform. [Source: GitLab SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** GitLab Senior SA = GitHub SA = Atlassian SA = AWS Senior SA

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Migration Expertise:** "I help enterprises migrate from GitHub and DIY tool chains to GitLab's unified platform. Each successful migration is a multi-year ARR commitment."
2. **Full-SDLC Architecture:** "I architect DevSecOps deployments spanning the entire SDLC — not just CI/CD or just security, but the unified platform."
3. **All-Remote Customer Engagement:** "Selling and deploying enterprise software entirely remotely requires specialized customer engagement skills."
4. **GitHub/Atlassian SA Counter:** Both pay SAs competitively. Push for top of band.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $160K over 4 years. My platform migrations directly convert enterprise customers and drive multi-year ARR commitments." Counter at $130K-$155K RSUs is competitive.
