### Data Engineer | GitLab Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($8B Market Cap) | All-Remote | DevSecOps Platform | Transparent Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| US (All-Remote) | $150K–$210K | $55K–$180K | 10% | $185K–$305K |
| San Francisco Benchmark | $155K–$215K | $60K–$185K | 10% | $190K–$315K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at GitLab build the internal data infrastructure that powers product analytics, customer insights, and business intelligence for the DevSecOps platform. GitLab's data team supports metrics across the entire SDLC — CI/CD pipeline performance, code review velocity, security scan coverage, and deployment frequency. The all-remote culture means the data team works asynchronously across time zones. GitLab's transparent handbook documents data engineering practices publicly. [Source: GitLab DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** GitLab Senior DE = GitHub DE = Google L4 DE = Datadog DE

**Global Levers**

1. **SDLC Metrics Platform:** "I'm building the data infrastructure that measures the entire software development lifecycle. GitLab's product decisions depend on my data pipelines."
2. **All-Remote Data Challenges:** "Building a data platform for an all-remote company requires async-first data practices and global time-zone coordination."
3. **Transparent Comp Baseline:** "I've reviewed GitLab's comp calculator and expect top-of-band placement for my level."
4. **Snowflake/Databricks DE Counter:** Both pay higher for DE roles. Push GitLab RSUs higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $170K over 4 years. I'm building the data infrastructure that drives GitLab's product decisions across the entire SDLC." Counter at $140K-$165K RSUs is competitive.
