### Product Manager | GitLab Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($8B Market Cap) | All-Remote | DevSecOps Platform | Transparent Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| US (All-Remote) | $155K–$215K | $65K–$190K | 10-15% | $195K–$320K |
| San Francisco Benchmark | $160K–$220K | $70K–$195K | 10-15% | $200K–$330K |

**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at GitLab own product domains within the DevSecOps platform — each PM manages a significant product area (CI/CD, security scanning, source management, GitLab Duo AI, or platform infrastructure). GitLab's transparent handbook documents PM expectations and practices publicly. PMs at GitLab work entirely async, making written product specs, strategy docs, and stakeholder communication the primary PM deliverables. PMs on GitLab Duo (AI) are the most strategically important and highest-compensated. [Source: GitLab PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** GitLab PM = GitHub PM = Google L5 PM = Atlassian PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Single-Platform Product Breadth:** "GitLab is the only single-application DevSecOps platform. My product decisions affect the entire SDLC, not just one tool in a suite."
2. **GitHub Competition:** "My product roadmap directly competes with GitHub, backed by Microsoft's resources. Winning requires exceptional product judgment."
3. **GitLab Duo AI Strategy:** If owning GitLab Duo, push for AI premium: "I'm defining GitLab's AI strategy against GitHub Copilot — the most important competitive decision at the company."
4. **GitHub/Atlassian PM Counter:** Both offer competitive PM comp. Push for top of band.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $185K over 4 years. I'm defining product strategy for the world's only single-application DevSecOps platform, competing directly with GitHub/Microsoft." Counter at $150K-$175K RSUs is competitive.
