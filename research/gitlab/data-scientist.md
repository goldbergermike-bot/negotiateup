### Data Scientist | GitLab Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($8B Market Cap) | All-Remote | DevSecOps Platform | Transparent Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| US (All-Remote) | $150K–$215K | $60K–$185K | 10% | $190K–$315K |
| San Francisco Benchmark | $155K–$220K | $65K–$190K | 10% | $195K–$325K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at GitLab work on both internal analytics (product usage, growth modeling, customer behavior) and product ML features (GitLab Duo AI, code suggestions, vulnerability detection). GitLab's DevSecOps platform generates rich data about software development practices — making DS roles uniquely positioned to derive insights about how software is built at scale. The all-remote culture and transparent handbook mean DS practices are publicly documented. [Source: GitLab DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** GitLab Senior DS = GitHub DS = Google L4 DS = Datadog DS

**Global Levers**

1. **DevSecOps ML Features:** If working on GitLab Duo AI, push for AI premium: "I'm building ML models that power GitLab Duo — AI code suggestions, vulnerability detection, and DevSecOps automation that compete directly with GitHub Copilot."
2. **SDLC Data Uniqueness:** "GitLab has unique data about the entire software development lifecycle. My ML models can surface insights about development practices that no other company can access."
3. **Growth Analytics Impact:** If working on product growth analytics, frame as revenue impact: "My growth models directly influence ARR expansion and customer retention."
4. **Google/Meta DS Counter:** Both offer higher DS comp. Push for top of band.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $180K over 4 years. I'm building ML models that power GitLab Duo AI and compete with GitHub Copilot." Counter at $145K-$170K RSUs is competitive.
