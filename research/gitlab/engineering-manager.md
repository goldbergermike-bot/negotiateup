### Engineering Manager | GitLab Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Public ($8B Market Cap) | All-Remote | DevSecOps Platform | Transparent Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| US (All-Remote) | $190K–$245K | $120K–$280K | 10-15% | $265K–$405K |
| San Francisco Benchmark | $195K–$250K | $125K–$290K | 10-15% | $270K–$415K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at GitLab lead all-remote engineering teams — a fundamentally different management challenge than in-office leadership. GitLab's handbook extensively documents management practices, making EM expectations transparent. EMs at GitLab must master async communication, written decision-making, and remote team building. The transparent comp calculator provides a baseline, but EM comp should be negotiated above the calculated range. GitLab EMs manage teams building a platform that competes with GitHub (Microsoft) for developer market share. [Source: GitLab EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** GitLab EM = GitHub EM = Google L5 Manager = Atlassian EM

**Global Levers**

1. **All-Remote Management Premium:** "Managing engineering teams in a fully remote, async-first environment requires a fundamentally different skill set than in-office management. This specialized leadership justifies premium comp."
2. **GitLab Handbook Mastery:** "GitLab's management practices are extensively documented. I need to not just follow these practices but contribute to evolving them."
3. **IC Parity:** Staff ICs at GitLab can earn $300K+ in RSUs. EMs must match: "My equity should be at least equal to the Staff ICs on my team."
4. **GitHub/Google EM Counter:** Both offer competitive EM comp with stable equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $270K over 4 years. All-remote engineering management is a specialized skill, and I have EM offers from GitHub and Google." Counter at $230K-$260K RSUs is competitive.
