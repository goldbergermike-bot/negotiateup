**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at GitLab build and maintain the infrastructure that runs GitLab.com — the SaaS version of the DevSecOps platform. There's a delightful meta-quality to this role: you're doing DevOps for the DevOps company, using GitLab to deploy GitLab. This "dogfooding" means your infrastructure work directly improves the product. GitLab.com serves millions of developers and runs one of the largest Rails applications in the world. Infrastructure reliability directly impacts customer trust and platform adoption. [Source: GitLab DevOps Comp 2025-2026]
