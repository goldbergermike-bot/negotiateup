### Security Engineer | Chime Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | MyPay 45% Margins | 29% Revenue Growth | $25B Valuation | **INNOVATION-IMPACT BONUS FOR MYPAY PRODUCT SUCCESS**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $192K–$222K | $148K–$208K | 15–20% | $238K–$292K |
| Chicago | $182K–$212K | $128K–$188K | 15–20% | $218K–$268K |
| Remote US | $175K–$205K | $118K–$178K | 15–20% | $208K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Chime Security Engineers (IC3-IC4) protect the banking platform and the financial data of 22M+ members — owning application security, infrastructure security, threat detection, compliance engineering, and fraud prevention across the largest US neobank. At IC3-IC4, you make the security decisions that determine whether Chime meets banking regulatory requirements, protects member funds, and maintains the trust that sustains 29% YoY revenue growth. Your security architecture directly enables MyPay's 45% margins by preventing fraud losses and ensuring regulatory compliance heading into the rumored 2026-2027 IPO. Pre-IPO equity is the highest-leverage comp component — candidates should negotiate Innovation-Impact bonuses tied to security and compliance metrics because Chime rewards security engineers whose work drives measurable financial protection and regulatory confidence.

**MyPay 45% Margin — The Innovation-Impact Bonus**

Chime's MyPay product is achieving 45% margins — the highest-margin product in Chime's portfolio and proof that the neobank innovation model works at scale. The 29% YoY revenue growth validates that Chime's product-led strategy is winning against traditional banks and fintech competitors. As a Security Engineer joining pre-IPO, you should negotiate an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to security and compliance success metrics — fraud prevention rates, vulnerability remediation velocity, compliance audit results, and security incident reduction. "MyPay is generating 45% margins and the company is growing revenue 29% YoY. I want an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to the security metrics I directly own — fraud loss prevention, vulnerability remediation time, compliance audit outcomes, and incident response effectiveness. Chime rewards innovation that drives financial results, and my security decisions protect the trust of 22M+ members and sustain MyPay's margins."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Options + Innovation-Impact Bonus:** "Chime is pre-IPO with a $25B peak valuation and 29% revenue growth. I want 25% more options than standard plus an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to MyPay's 45% margin success — my security decisions directly protect the member trust and fraud prevention that underpin the IPO valuation."
2. **Banking-Grade Security at Neobank Speed:** "I protect the financial data and transactions of 22M+ members — the largest US neobank. Banking-grade security requirements combined with neobank innovation velocity demand specialized security expertise that commands significant premium compensation."
3. **Cash App/Google Security Parity + IPO Premium:** "Cash App Security Engineers at Block earn $292K+ TC with liquid RSUs. Google Security L5 earns $380K+ TC. Chime must offer significantly more pre-IPO options to attract security engineers from companies with liquid equity — especially given the critical nature of fintech security."
4. **IPO-Readiness Security Posture:** "I build the security posture required for IPO-readiness — the SOC 2, PCI-DSS, and banking compliance frameworks that determine whether Chime can pass the security due diligence required for a successful 2026-2027 IPO at the $25B valuation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base and 25% more options than the standard equity offer for this Security Engineer role before the 2026-2027 IPO. I protect the platform and member trust enabling MyPay's 45% margins and the security posture supporting 22M+ members and 29% revenue growth. I have competing offers from [Cash App Security at $292K TC / Google Security L5 at $380K TC / SoFi Security at $268K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Chime have asymmetric upside — plus I want an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to fraud prevention and compliance metrics." Accept at $192K+ base and 20%+ more options than standard.
