### DevOps Engineer | Chime Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | MyPay 45% Margins | 29% Revenue Growth | $25B Valuation | **INNOVATION-IMPACT BONUS FOR MYPAY PRODUCT SUCCESS**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $162K–$188K | $108K–$152K | 10–15% | $192K–$235K |
| Chicago | $155K–$178K | $92K–$138K | 10–15% | $178K–$218K |
| Remote US | $148K–$172K | $85K–$128K | 10–15% | $168K–$208K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Chime DevOps Engineers (IC2-IC3) build and maintain the infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment systems that keep the banking platform running reliably for 22M+ members — ensuring the largest US neobank can ship features rapidly while maintaining the uptime and security that financial services demand. At IC2-IC3, you own the infrastructure decisions that determine deployment velocity, system reliability, and operational efficiency across SpotMe, Credit Builder, direct deposit, and the high-margin MyPay product. Your infrastructure choices directly enable the 29% YoY revenue growth and sustain MyPay's 45% margins heading into the rumored 2026-2027 IPO. Pre-IPO equity is the highest-leverage comp component — candidates should negotiate Innovation-Impact bonuses tied to infrastructure performance metrics because Chime rewards engineers whose operational excellence drives measurable financial results.

**MyPay 45% Margin — The Innovation-Impact Bonus**

Chime's MyPay product is achieving 45% margins — the highest-margin product in Chime's portfolio and proof that the neobank innovation model works at scale. The 29% YoY revenue growth validates that Chime's product-led strategy is winning against traditional banks and fintech competitors. As a DevOps Engineer joining pre-IPO, you should negotiate an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to infrastructure and operational success metrics — system uptime, deployment frequency, incident response time, and infrastructure cost efficiency. "MyPay is generating 45% margins and the company is growing revenue 29% YoY. I want an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to the infrastructure metrics I directly own — system uptime, deployment velocity, mean time to recovery, and infrastructure cost per transaction. Chime rewards innovation that drives financial results, and my infrastructure decisions underpin the reliability for 22M+ members."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Options + Innovation-Impact Bonus:** "Chime is pre-IPO with a $25B peak valuation and 29% revenue growth. I want 20% more options than standard plus an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to MyPay's 45% margin success — my infrastructure decisions directly drive the deployment velocity and system reliability that underpin the IPO valuation."
2. **Banking-Grade Infrastructure at Scale:** "I build and maintain the infrastructure serving 22M+ members — the largest US neobank. Banking-grade uptime requirements combined with neobank deployment velocity demand specialized DevOps expertise that commands premium compensation."
3. **Cash App/Fintech DevOps Parity + IPO Premium:** "Cash App SRE/DevOps at Block earn $235K+ TC with liquid RSUs. Google SRE L4 earns $320K+ TC. Chime must offer more pre-IPO options to attract infrastructure engineers from companies with liquid equity and proven DevOps compensation."
4. **Deployment Velocity for Revenue Growth:** "I enable the deployment velocity that drives Chime's 29% revenue growth — the CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, and operational tooling that allow engineering teams to ship features rapidly to 22M+ members while maintaining banking-grade reliability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $182K base and 20% more options than the standard equity offer for this DevOps Engineer role before the 2026-2027 IPO. I build the infrastructure enabling MyPay's 45% margins and the deployment velocity supporting 22M+ members and 29% revenue growth. I have competing offers from [Cash App SRE at $235K TC / Google SRE L4 at $320K TC / SoFi DevOps at $218K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Chime have asymmetric upside — plus I want an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to infrastructure reliability metrics." Accept at $162K+ base and 15%+ more options than standard.
