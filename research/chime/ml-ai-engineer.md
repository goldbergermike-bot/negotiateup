### ML/AI Engineer | Chime Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | MyPay 45% Margins | 29% Revenue Growth | $25B Valuation | +15-25% AI Premium | **INNOVATION-IMPACT BONUS FOR MYPAY PRODUCT SUCCESS**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $212K–$242K | $198K–$278K | 15–20% | $282K–$348K |
| Chicago | $202K–$232K | $172K–$255K | 15–20% | $258K–$322K |
| Remote US | $192K–$222K | $158K–$242K | 15–20% | $248K–$308K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Chime ML/AI Engineers (IC3-IC4) build the machine learning models and AI systems that power risk decisioning, fraud detection, member personalization, and product optimization across the banking platform serving 22M+ members. At IC3-IC4 with a +15-25% AI Premium, you develop the ML models that determine credit eligibility for SpotMe, optimize member segmentation, detect fraudulent transactions in real time, and drive the product intelligence behind the high-margin MyPay product. Your models directly enable the 29% YoY revenue growth and sustain MyPay's 45% margins through intelligent automation and predictive analytics heading into the rumored 2026-2027 IPO. Pre-IPO equity is the highest-leverage comp component — candidates should negotiate Innovation-Impact bonuses tied to model performance metrics because Chime rewards ML/AI engineers whose intelligent systems drive measurable financial results.

**MyPay 45% Margin — The Innovation-Impact Bonus**

Chime's MyPay product is achieving 45% margins — the highest-margin product in Chime's portfolio and proof that the neobank innovation model works at scale. The 29% YoY revenue growth validates that Chime's product-led strategy is winning against traditional banks and fintech competitors. As an ML/AI Engineer joining pre-IPO with a +15-25% AI Premium, you should negotiate an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to model performance and product success metrics — prediction accuracy, fraud detection rates, member personalization lift, and revenue attribution from ML-driven features. "MyPay is generating 45% margins and the company is growing revenue 29% YoY. I want an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to the ML metrics I directly own — model accuracy, fraud detection precision, credit decisioning performance, and revenue lift from ML-driven personalization. Chime rewards innovation that drives financial results, and my models power the intelligent systems serving 22M+ members."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Options + AI Premium + Innovation-Impact Bonus:** "Chime is pre-IPO with a $25B peak valuation and 29% revenue growth. I want 25% more options than standard — with the +15-25% AI Premium already reflecting market rates — plus an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to MyPay's 45% margin success. My ML models directly drive the intelligent product decisions that underpin the IPO valuation."
2. **Fintech ML at 22M+ Member Scale:** "I build ML models on data from 22M+ members — the largest US neobank. The scale of Chime's transaction data enables uniquely powerful credit decisioning, fraud detection, and personalization models that directly drive revenue and margin optimization."
3. **Cash App/Google ML Parity + IPO Premium:** "Cash App ML Engineers at Block earn $348K+ TC with liquid RSUs. Google ML L5 earns $420K+ TC. Chime must offer significantly more pre-IPO options — even with the AI Premium — to attract ML talent from companies with liquid equity and world-class ML compensation."
4. **Intelligent Product Innovation:** "I build the ML systems that power Chime's next-generation products — the credit decisioning, fraud detection, and personalization models that determine whether MyPay can sustain 45% margins and the company can maintain 29% revenue growth through intelligent automation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $232K base with the +15-25% AI Premium and 25% more options than the standard equity offer for this ML/AI Engineer role before the 2026-2027 IPO. I build the ML models driving MyPay's 45% margins — credit decisioning, fraud detection, and personalization — supporting 22M+ members and 29% revenue growth. I have competing offers from [Cash App ML at $348K TC / Google ML L5 at $420K TC / SoFi ML at $308K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Chime have asymmetric upside — plus I want an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to ML model performance metrics." Accept at $208K+ base and 20%+ more options than standard.
