### Software Engineer | Chime Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | MyPay 45% Margins | 29% Revenue Growth | $25B Valuation | **INNOVATION-IMPACT BONUS FOR MYPAY PRODUCT SUCCESS**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $168K–$198K | $118K–$162K | 10–15% | $205K–$248K |
| Chicago | $158K–$188K | $98K–$142K | 10–15% | $185K–$228K |
| Remote US | $155K–$185K | $92K–$138K | 10–15% | $178K–$225K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Chime Software Engineers (IC2-IC3) build the core banking platform serving 22M+ members — the largest US neobank — shipping consumer-facing features across SpotMe, direct deposit, fee-free banking, and the high-margin MyPay product. At IC2-IC3, you write the production code that drives the 29% YoY revenue growth and directly contributes to the platform capabilities that sustain MyPay's 45% margins. Pre-IPO equity is the highest-leverage comp component — candidates should negotiate Innovation-Impact bonuses tied to product metrics because Chime rewards engineers whose code drives measurable financial results ahead of the rumored 2026-2027 IPO.

**MyPay 45% Margin — The Innovation-Impact Bonus**

Chime's MyPay product is achieving 45% margins — the highest-margin product in Chime's portfolio and proof that the neobank innovation model works at scale. The 29% YoY revenue growth validates that Chime's product-led strategy is winning against traditional banks and fintech competitors. As a Software Engineer joining pre-IPO, you should negotiate an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to product success metrics — feature adoption rates, margin contribution, and revenue per member. "MyPay is generating 45% margins and the company is growing revenue 29% YoY. I want an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to the product metrics I directly influence — feature adoption, transaction volume, and margin contribution. Chime rewards innovation that drives financial results, and my code ships directly to 22M+ members."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Options + Innovation-Impact Bonus:** "Chime is pre-IPO with a $25B peak valuation and 29% revenue growth. I want more options than standard plus an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to MyPay's 45% margin success — my code directly drives the product metrics that underpin the IPO valuation."
2. **22M+ Member Scale:** "I build features shipping to 22M+ members — the largest US neobank. Every line of code I write has immediate revenue impact at scale. That direct member impact justifies above-band equity and an Innovation-Impact bonus."
3. **Cash App/Revolut Parity + IPO Premium:** "Cash App SWEs at Block earn $248K+ TC with liquid RSUs. Revolut engineers earn competitive packages with public-company stability. Chime must offer more pre-IPO options to attract engineers from companies with liquid equity."
4. **MyPay Product Velocity:** "I ship the features driving MyPay's 45% margins — the highest-margin product in Chime's portfolio. My engineering velocity directly determines whether Chime can scale this product ahead of the 2026-2027 IPO."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $188K base and 25% more options than the standard equity offer for this Software Engineer role before the 2026-2027 IPO. I build the platform features shipping to 22M+ members that drive MyPay's 45% margins and 29% revenue growth. I have competing offers from [Cash App at $248K TC / Revolut at $235K TC / SoFi at $228K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Chime have asymmetric upside — plus I want an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to MyPay product metrics." Accept at $172K+ base and 15%+ more options than standard.
