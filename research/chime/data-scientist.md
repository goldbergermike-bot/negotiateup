### Data Scientist | Chime Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | MyPay 45% Margins | 29% Revenue Growth | $25B Valuation | **INNOVATION-IMPACT BONUS FOR MYPAY PRODUCT SUCCESS**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K–$212K | $138K–$192K | 15–20% | $225K–$272K |
| Chicago | $175K–$202K | $118K–$172K | 15–20% | $208K–$252K |
| Remote US | $168K–$195K | $108K–$162K | 15–20% | $195K–$238K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Chime Data Scientists (IC3-IC4) build the analytical models and data-driven insights that power the banking platform serving 22M+ members — owning experimentation, member behavior modeling, risk analytics, and product optimization across SpotMe, Credit Builder, direct deposit, and the high-margin MyPay product. At IC3-IC4, you make the analytical decisions that determine member segmentation, feature personalization, and revenue optimization for the largest US neobank. Your models directly drive the 29% YoY revenue growth and shape MyPay's 45% margin trajectory heading into the rumored 2026-2027 IPO. Pre-IPO equity is the highest-leverage comp component — candidates should negotiate Innovation-Impact bonuses tied to model performance metrics because Chime rewards data scientists whose analytical work drives measurable financial results.

**MyPay 45% Margin — The Innovation-Impact Bonus**

Chime's MyPay product is achieving 45% margins — the highest-margin product in Chime's portfolio and proof that the neobank innovation model works at scale. The 29% YoY revenue growth validates that Chime's product-led strategy is winning against traditional banks and fintech competitors. As a Data Scientist joining pre-IPO, you should negotiate an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to model performance and product success metrics — prediction accuracy, experiment wins, member lifetime value improvement, and revenue attribution. "MyPay is generating 45% margins and the company is growing revenue 29% YoY. I want an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to the analytical metrics I directly influence — model performance, experiment win rates, member lifetime value optimization, and revenue attribution from my insights. Chime rewards innovation that drives financial results, and my models shape decision-making for 22M+ members."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Options + Innovation-Impact Bonus:** "Chime is pre-IPO with a $25B peak valuation and 29% revenue growth. I want 25% more options than standard plus an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to MyPay's 45% margin success — my analytical models directly drive the member insights and revenue optimization that underpin the IPO valuation."
2. **22M+ Member Data Scale:** "I build models on data from 22M+ members — the largest US neobank. The scale and richness of Chime's transaction data enables uniquely powerful member behavior models that directly drive product decisions and revenue optimization."
3. **Cash App/Google DS Parity + IPO Premium:** "Cash App Data Scientists at Block earn $272K+ TC with liquid RSUs. Google L5 DS earns $350K+ TC. Chime must offer significantly more pre-IPO options to attract data scientists from companies with liquid equity and proven analytical compensation."
4. **Risk and Revenue Modeling:** "I build the risk models and revenue optimization algorithms that sustain MyPay's 45% margins — the analytical work that determines credit decisioning, member segmentation, and product pricing across the largest US neobank."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $202K base and 25% more options than the standard equity offer for this Data Scientist role before the 2026-2027 IPO. I build the analytical models driving MyPay's 45% margins and the member insights supporting 22M+ members and 29% revenue growth. I have competing offers from [Cash App DS at $272K TC / Google L5 DS at $350K TC / SoFi DS at $248K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Chime have asymmetric upside — plus I want an Innovation-Impact bonus tied to model performance metrics." Accept at $185K+ base and 20%+ more options than standard.
