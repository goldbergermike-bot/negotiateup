**Negotiation DNA**

Walmart Global Tech Software Engineers build systems that serve 240M+ weekly customers across the world's largest omnichannel retailer. The engineering challenges are massive: e-commerce platforms processing millions of orders, store technology serving 4,700+ US locations, supply chain systems managing one of the largest logistics networks on Earth, and financial systems processing more transactions than any retailer. Walmart Global Tech has transformed its compensation to be genuinely competitive with Big Tech — WMT RSUs are blue-chip (stable, dividend-paying), base salaries have increased significantly, and the 10-15% bonus adds guaranteed comp. The Bentonville cost-of-living advantage makes Walmart comp go 2-3x further than Bay Area equivalents. [Source: Walmart Global Tech SWE Comp 2026]
