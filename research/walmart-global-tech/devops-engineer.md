Walmart Global Tech DevOps Engineers build and maintain infrastructure for the world's largest retailer — supporting e-commerce platforms, store technology, supply chain systems, and financial processing. Walmart's infrastructure must serve 240M+ weekly customers with zero downtime during peak events (Black Friday, back-to-school, holiday season). The reliability requirements for retail infrastructure are extreme — a major outage during peak shopping could cost hundreds of millions. Walmart has invested heavily in cloud infrastructure and modern DevOps practices. WMT RSUs provide blue-chip stability. [Source: Walmart Global Tech DevOps Comp 2026]
