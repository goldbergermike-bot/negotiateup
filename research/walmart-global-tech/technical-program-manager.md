### Technical Program Manager | Walmart Global Tech Global Negotiation Guide

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Walmart Global Tech Technical Program Managers coordinate complex programs across the world's largest retailer — e-commerce platform migrations, omnichannel commerce initiatives, supply chain modernization, and store technology rollouts. TPMs at Walmart manage programs with unique complexity: technology changes that must be deployed across 4,700+ stores, coordinated with supply chain operations, and launched without disrupting service for 240M+ weekly customers. The operational coordination required for Walmart-scale rollouts is unmatched. WMT RSUs provide blue-chip stability. [Source: Walmart Global Tech TPM Comp 2026]
