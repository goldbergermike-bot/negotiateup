**Negotiation DNA**

Walmart Global Tech ML/AI Engineers build machine learning models for demand forecasting, pricing optimization, personalization, supply chain intelligence, and fraud detection at a scale no other retailer approaches. Your models serve 240M+ weekly customers and optimize operations across 4,700+ stores, e-commerce, and a global supply chain. ML at Walmart has direct, measurable revenue impact — small improvements in demand forecasting or pricing models translate to hundreds of millions in annual value. The 5-10% ML premium reflects the scarcity of ML engineers who can build production-grade retail models at Walmart's scale. [Source: Walmart Global Tech ML Comp 2026]
