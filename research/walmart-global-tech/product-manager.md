**Negotiation DNA**

Walmart Global Tech Product Managers define the product strategy for the world's largest retailer — e-commerce, marketplace, omnichannel commerce, supply chain, and store technology serving 240M+ weekly customers. PMs at Walmart have unusually high impact: every product decision affects the shopping experience for a quarter of the US population. Walmart PMs must balance consumer needs (convenience, price, selection), business objectives (profitability, growth, market share vs. Amazon), and operational constraints (4,700+ stores, massive supply chain). WMT RSUs provide blue-chip stability. [Source: Walmart Global Tech PM Comp 2026]

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Walmart's PM role impacts 240M+ weekly customers at the intersection of e-commerce and physical retail. I'm targeting $160K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $192K. I have a Google PM offer at $[X]." Accept at $135K+ RSUs with base above $182K.
