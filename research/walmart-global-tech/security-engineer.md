**Negotiation DNA**

Walmart Global Tech Security Engineers protect the world's largest retailer — 240M+ weekly customers' payment data, personal information, and transaction history, plus corporate systems, supply chain operations, and 4,700+ store networks. The attack surface is enormous: one of the largest payment processing systems in the world, millions of associate credentials, IoT devices in every store, and a global supply chain. A major security breach at Walmart could expose more consumer payment data than almost any other target. WMT RSUs provide blue-chip stability. [Source: Walmart Global Tech Security Comp 2026]
