**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Walmart Global Tech own critical systems serving the world's largest retailer. At this level, you drive technical decisions for platforms that process more retail transactions than any other company. Walmart's tech org has matured significantly — senior engineers work on distributed systems, real-time pricing, supply chain optimization, and omnichannel commerce at a scale that rivals any Big Tech company. WMT RSUs at senior level provide stable, growing equity. The Bentonville advantage means your comp goes significantly further than Bay Area alternatives.

**Level Mapping:** Walmart Global Tech Senior SWE = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Amazon SDE-II/III = Apple ICT3

**Global Levers**

1. **Walmart Scale System Ownership:** "I'll own systems serving 240M+ weekly customers. The reliability and performance requirements for the world's largest retailer exceed most tech companies."
2. **WMT Equity Growth:** "WMT stock has been one of the best-performing large-cap retail stocks. The RSU grant at senior level should be sized to reflect this stable growth trajectory: $180K+ over 4 years."
3. **Omnichannel Complexity:** "Walmart's omnichannel challenge — online, in-store, pickup, delivery — creates engineering problems more complex than pure e-commerce companies."
4. **Cost-of-Living Advantage:** "In Bentonville, my $285K total comp exceeds the real purchasing power of $450K+ in the Bay Area."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "At the Senior level, I'll own critical systems for the world's largest retailer. I'm targeting $185K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $198K. I have a Google L4 offer at $[X]. Walmart's scale and WMT stability are compelling." Accept at $155K+ RSUs with base above $188K.
