**Negotiation DNA**

Walmart Global Tech Product Designers shape the shopping experience for 240M+ weekly customers — from the Walmart app and website to in-store digital experiences to the omnichannel journey (buy online, pickup in-store, delivery). Designing for Walmart means serving the broadest customer base in retail — every demographic, income level, and use case. The design challenge is accessibility at massive scale: making commerce intuitive for everyone. WMT RSUs provide blue-chip stability. [Source: Walmart Global Tech Product Design Comp 2026]
