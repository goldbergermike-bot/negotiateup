**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Booking.com — the world's largest online travel platform with 28M+ listings and $150B+ in annual gross bookings — design the end-to-end system architectures that connect AI agents to Booking.com's vast ecosystem of properties, payment systems, and partner integrations. As the platform transforms from search-based booking to autonomous AI agents handling the entire guest journey, Solutions Architects define how agent systems integrate across the technology stack — from LLM orchestration to real-time inventory systems to payment processing. Your architectural solutions directly enable revenue-critical guest interactions, and Booking Holdings (BKNG, ~$5,000/share) RSUs tie your compensation to the systems you design. The 35% Agentic Premium recognizes that your integration architectures determine whether AI agents can successfully complete bookings end-to-end. Amsterdam is the primary HQ.

**Agentic Front Door — From Search to Agents**

Booking.com is replacing its search-based booking interface with AI agents — autonomous systems that handle the entire guest journey through conversation: understanding travel intent, recommending destinations and properties, comparing options, handling booking logistics, and providing in-trip support. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Agents' — and it means every engineering role at Booking.com now touches revenue-critical guest interactions. "As a Solutions Architect, you design the integration architectures that connect Booking.com's AI agents to every system they need to complete a booking — inventory, pricing, availability, payments, partner APIs, and post-booking services. The AI agent IS the booking interface — every agent interaction directly determines whether a guest books, and your integration architecture determines whether the agent can access the right data, process the transaction, and fulfill the booking in real time. Replacing search with agents means Booking.com's entire $150B+ gross booking volume flows through AI agent interactions connected by architectures you design. Candidates should argue: 'I architect the integrations that enable AI agents to handle revenue-critical guest interactions end-to-end — from property discovery to payment processing. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that my architectural solutions directly determine whether Booking.com's agents can close bookings and generate revenue.' Compare to: solutions architects for search systems design query pipelines — agent solutions architects design the complete transaction architecture where every integration point is critical to completing a live booking." Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Revenue-Critical Interactions:** "I architect the end-to-end integration solutions that enable AI agents to handle every revenue-critical guest interaction. My designs connect agents to inventory, pricing, and payments — if any integration fails, the agent can't complete the booking. Every architectural decision I make is a revenue decision."
2. **$150B+ Gross Bookings Through Agents:** "My integration architectures support $150B+ in gross bookings flowing through AI agent interactions. A single architectural improvement — like reducing the latency of real-time pricing queries during agent conversations — can unlock higher conversion rates across the entire platform."
3. **28M+ Listings — World's Largest Travel Platform:** "I'm designing integration architectures that connect AI agents to 28M+ listings across thousands of property partners, each with different systems, APIs, and data formats. The architectural complexity of making all this work seamlessly in real-time conversational booking is immense."
4. **Cross-System Integration Expertise:** "Booking.com's AI agents need to orchestrate across dozens of internal and external systems in real time during every guest conversation. My solutions architecture expertise in connecting LLM orchestration layers to travel industry systems — GDS, channel managers, payment processors — is rare and critical."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting €105K base and $92K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this Solutions Architect position. I design the integration architectures that enable AI agents to complete revenue-critical guest interactions end-to-end — connecting agents to inventory, pricing, and payment systems that process $150B+ in bookings. I have competing offers from AWS at €178K TC / Salesforce at €185K TC." Accept at €82K base and $58K RSUs.
