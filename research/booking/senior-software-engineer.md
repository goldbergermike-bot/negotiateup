**Negotiation DNA**

As a Senior Software Engineer at Booking.com — the world's largest online travel platform with 28M+ listings and $150B+ in annual gross bookings — you own critical technical decisions that shape the AI agent systems replacing traditional search-based booking. This role carries outsized impact because Senior Engineers design the architectures, lead the technical implementations, and mentor teams building the autonomous AI agents that now handle revenue-critical guest interactions end-to-end. Booking Holdings (BKNG, ~$5,000/share) RSUs form a substantial equity component, and the 35% Agentic Premium is justified by the direct line between your technical leadership and booking conversion rates across the platform's massive transaction volume. Amsterdam is the primary HQ with strong packages in New York and London.

**Agentic Front Door — From Search to Agents**

Booking.com is replacing its search-based booking interface with AI agents — autonomous systems that handle the entire guest journey through conversation: understanding travel intent, recommending destinations and properties, comparing options, handling booking logistics, and providing in-trip support. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Agents' — and it means every engineering role at Booking.com now touches revenue-critical guest interactions. "As a Senior Software Engineer, you architect and lead the development of the AI agent systems that are becoming Booking.com's primary booking interface. The AI agent IS the booking interface — every agent interaction directly determines whether a guest books, and your architectural decisions determine how effectively millions of these revenue-critical conversations convert. Replacing search with agents means Booking.com's entire $150B+ gross booking volume flows through AI agent interactions that you design and build. Candidates should argue: 'I architect the AI agents that handle revenue-critical guest interactions — every system design decision I make affects millions of potential $500+ bookings. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that my technical leadership directly determines Booking.com's conversion rate and revenue per guest at scale.' Compare to: senior search engineers optimize ranking algorithms with indirect revenue impact — senior agent engineers design systems where every interaction is a live transaction. Your architecture doesn't just improve search relevance; it determines whether autonomous booking conversations succeed or fail." Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Revenue-Critical Interactions:** "As a Senior Engineer, I architect the AI agent systems that handle every revenue-critical guest interaction. My design decisions don't just affect search rankings — they determine whether autonomous booking conversations convert, directly impacting Booking.com's $150B+ gross booking volume."
2. **$150B+ Gross Bookings Through Agents:** "Every architectural decision I make scales across Booking.com's $150B+ in annual gross bookings.

3. **28M+ Listings — World's Largest Travel Platform:** "I'm designing agent architectures that intelligently match guests across 28M+ listings in real-time conversational contexts. The technical complexity of building AI agents that understand travel intent, negotiate pricing, and manage bookings across this scale is uniquely challenging."
4. **Technical Leadership & Mentorship Multiplier:** "As a Senior Engineer, my impact multiplies through the engineers I mentor and the architectural patterns I establish. Every engineer building on my agent architecture contributes to revenue-critical guest interactions, making my leadership a force multiplier on Booking.com's agentic transformation."
