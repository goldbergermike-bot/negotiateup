**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Booking.com — the world's largest online travel platform with 28M+ listings and $150B+ in annual gross bookings — drive the analytical intelligence behind the AI agents replacing search-based booking. At a company legendary for its data-driven experimentation culture (running thousands of A/B tests simultaneously), Data Scientists now apply this rigor to optimizing AI agent conversations: measuring agent effectiveness, modeling guest intent, predicting booking probability within conversations, and designing experiments that improve agent conversion rates. Your analytical work directly shapes revenue-critical guest interactions, and Booking Holdings (BKNG, ~$5,000/share) RSUs tie your compensation to the insights you generate. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that your analysis directly optimizes the AI agent conversations through which all bookings now flow. Amsterdam is the primary HQ.

**Agentic Front Door — From Search to Agents**

Booking.com is replacing its search-based booking interface with AI agents — autonomous systems that handle the entire guest journey through conversation: understanding travel intent, recommending destinations and properties, comparing options, handling booking logistics, and providing in-trip support. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Agents' — and it means every engineering role at Booking.com now touches revenue-critical guest interactions. "As a Data Scientist, you measure, model, and optimize the AI agent conversations that are becoming Booking.com's primary booking interface. The AI agent IS the booking interface — every agent interaction directly determines whether a guest books, and your analytical models determine how these revenue-critical conversations improve over time. Replacing search with agents means Booking.com's entire $150B+ gross booking volume flows through AI agent interactions that you analyze and optimize. Candidates should argue: 'I analyze and optimize the AI agent conversations that handle revenue-critical guest interactions — every model I build, every experiment I design, directly improves millions of potential $500+ bookings. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that my analytical work directly determines Booking.com's conversion rate and revenue per guest.' Compare to: data scientists on search teams optimize click-through rates — agent data scientists optimize live booking conversations where every analytical insight directly affects transaction completion." Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Revenue-Critical Interactions:** "I analyze and optimize the AI agent conversations that handle every revenue-critical guest interaction. My models predict booking probability within conversations, my experiments test agent strategies, and my insights directly improve conversion rates — this is fundamentally more revenue-critical than optimizing search results."
2. **$150B+ Gross Bookings Through Agents:** "My analytical work optimizes how $150B+ in gross bookings flows through AI agent conversations. A single insight I uncover — like identifying the conversation pattern that maximizes booking probability — can shift conversion rates across the entire platform."
3. **28M+ Listings — World's Largest Travel Platform:** "I'm building models that help AI agents intelligently match guests across 28M+ listings through conversational interactions. The analytical complexity of understanding guest intent, predicting preferences, and optimizing recommendations in real-time conversations at this scale is unmatched."
4. **Experimentation Culture Applied to Agents:** "Booking.com's world-class experimentation culture is now applied to AI agent conversations. I design and analyze experiments on how agents converse, recommend, and close — generating insights that directly drive revenue through better agent performance."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting €108K base and $100K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this Data Scientist position. I analyze and optimize AI agent conversations that handle revenue-critical guest interactions — my models and experiments directly improve conversion rates across $150B+ in gross bookings. I have competing offers from Spotify at €182K TC / ING at €188K TC." Accept at €82K base and $65K RSUs.
