**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Booking.com — the world's largest online travel platform with 28M+ listings and $150B+ in annual gross bookings — drive the execution of the most complex cross-functional programs in Booking.com's agentic transformation. As the platform shifts from search-based booking to AI agent-based booking, TPMs coordinate across engineering, product, data science, and operations teams to deliver the AI agent systems that handle the entire guest journey. Your program leadership directly determines the pace at which revenue-critical guest interactions are transformed through AI agents, and Booking Holdings (BKNG, ~$5,000/share) RSUs align your compensation with program delivery outcomes. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that your program execution directly controls the rollout timeline for AI agents that handle every booking transaction. Amsterdam is the primary HQ.

**Agentic Front Door — From Search to Agents**

Booking.com is replacing its search-based booking interface with AI agents — autonomous systems that handle the entire guest journey through conversation: understanding travel intent, recommending destinations and properties, comparing options, handling booking logistics, and providing in-trip support. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Agents' — and it means every engineering role at Booking.com now touches revenue-critical guest interactions. "As a Technical Program Manager, you drive the execution of the cross-functional programs that deliver Booking.com's AI agent systems — coordinating engineering, product, data science, and operations teams to ship the agents that replace the search interface. The AI agent IS the booking interface — every agent interaction directly determines whether a guest books, and your program leadership determines how quickly and reliably these revenue-critical systems launch and scale. Replacing search with agents means Booking.com's entire $150B+ gross booking volume flows through AI agent interactions delivered by programs you manage. Candidates should argue: 'I drive the programs that deliver AI agents handling revenue-critical guest interactions — every milestone I hit, every dependency I unblock, directly accelerates the deployment of systems that determine Booking.com's revenue. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that my program leadership directly determines the pace of Booking.com's agentic transformation and revenue capture.' Compare to: TPMs on search programs manage feature rollouts — agent TPMs manage the delivery of the entire next-generation booking interface where every program delay costs bookings." Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Revenue-Critical Interactions:** "I manage the programs that deliver AI agents handling every revenue-critical guest interaction. My program execution directly determines how quickly Booking.com transitions from search to agents — every week of acceleration in my programs translates to earlier revenue capture through agentic booking."
2. **$150B+ Gross Bookings Through Agents:** "The programs I manage deliver the AI agent systems through which $150B+ in annual gross bookings will flow. Program delays don't just miss deadlines — they delay the capture of booking revenue through the agentic interface that will replace search."
3. **28M+ Listings — World's Largest Travel Platform:** "I coordinate programs spanning 28M+ listings across 220+ countries, managing the complexity of rolling out AI agent systems across different markets, languages, regulatory environments, and property types simultaneously."
4. **Cross-Functional Coordination at Scale:** "The agentic transformation touches every part of Booking.com — engineering, product, data science, operations, legal, finance. My ability to coordinate across these functions and unblock dependencies is critical to the pace of the transformation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting €98K base and $82K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this Technical Program Manager position. I drive the programs delivering AI agents that handle revenue-critical guest interactions — every program milestone I hit accelerates Booking.com's capture of $150B+ in booking volume through the agentic interface. I have competing offers from Philips at €162K TC / TomTom at €168K TC." Accept at €75K base and $52K RSUs.
