Engineering Managers at Booking.com — the world's largest online travel platform with 28M+ listings and $150B+ in annual gross bookings — lead the teams building the AI agent systems that are replacing traditional search-based booking. You own team delivery, hiring, and technical execution for the most critical transformation in Booking.com's history: the shift from a search interface to autonomous AI agents that handle the entire guest journey. Your leadership directly determines how quickly and effectively revenue-critical guest interactions are automated through conversational AI, with Booking Holdings (BKNG, ~$5,000/share) RSUs aligning your compensation to the platform's agentic success. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that your team's output directly controls booking conversion rates. Amsterdam is the primary HQ.

**Agentic Front Door — From Search to Agents**

Booking.com is replacing its search-based booking interface with AI agents — autonomous systems that handle the entire guest journey through conversation: understanding travel intent, recommending destinations and properties, comparing options, handling booking logistics, and providing in-trip support. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Agents' — and it means every engineering role at Booking.com now touches revenue-critical guest interactions. "As an Engineering Manager, you lead the teams that build, deploy, and scale the AI agents replacing Booking.com's search interface. The AI agent IS the booking interface — every agent interaction directly determines whether a guest books, and your team's velocity and quality directly determine how well these revenue-critical conversations convert. Replacing search with agents means Booking.com's entire $150B+ gross booking volume flows through AI agent interactions that your team builds and maintains. Candidates should argue: 'I lead the engineering teams building AI agents that handle revenue-critical guest interactions — my team's output directly determines whether millions of booking conversations convert. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that my leadership directly determines Booking.com's conversion rate and revenue per guest through the teams I build and guide.' Compare to: engineering managers on search teams manage ranking improvements — agent team managers lead teams whose output is the actual booking interface for every transaction." Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Revenue-Critical Interactions:** "I lead the engineering teams whose output IS the revenue-critical guest interaction layer. Every feature my team ships, every agent improvement we deploy, directly determines whether autonomous booking conversations convert — this is fundamentally different from managing teams that support search."
2. **$150B+ Gross Bookings Through Agents:** "My team's engineering output handles $150B+ in annual gross bookings as they flow through AI agent interactions. The velocity and quality of my team's delivery directly determines Booking.com's revenue — a single sprint's improvements can shift conversion rates across the platform."
3. **28M+ Listings — World's Largest Travel Platform:** "I manage engineers building AI agents that serve 28M+ listings globally. Recruiting, retaining, and leading world-class AI agent engineers in a market where this talent is scarce requires compensation that reflects both the scale and the competitive landscape."
4. **Talent Acquisition & Retention in Agentic AI:** "The market for engineers who can build autonomous booking agents is extremely competitive. As an Engineering Manager, I'm not just leading a team — I'm building and retaining the talent pipeline for Booking.com's most critical strategic initiative. My ability to attract top agent engineers directly impacts execution speed."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting €145K base and $170K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this Engineering Manager position. I lead teams building AI agents that handle revenue-critical guest interactions — my team's output directly determines conversion rates across $150B+ in gross bookings. I have competing offers from Adyen at €245K TC / Uber Amsterdam at €258K TC." Accept at €112K base and $100K RSUs.
