### Security Engineer | Booking.com Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + BKNG RSUs (4yr vest) + 15-20% Bonus | Travel & Hospitality Platform | Agentic AI Front Door | **+35% AGENTIC PREMIUM** | Revenue-Critical Guest Interactions

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (BKNG RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|-------|------------|
| Amsterdam | €85K–€118K | $68K–$115K | 15–20% | €138K–€202K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Booking.com — the world's largest online travel platform with 28M+ listings and $150B+ in annual gross bookings — protect the AI agent systems that handle sensitive guest data, payment transactions, and personal travel information across every autonomous booking conversation. As Booking.com transforms from search-based booking to AI agents that manage the entire guest journey, Security Engineers face entirely new threat vectors: prompt injection attacks that could manipulate booking recommendations, data exfiltration through conversational interfaces, and adversarial attacks on agent decision-making that could redirect revenue. Your security work directly protects revenue-critical guest interactions, and Booking Holdings (BKNG, ~$5,000/share) RSUs align your compensation with the platform's trustworthiness. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that a single security failure in an AI agent conversation could compromise guest trust and booking revenue at massive scale. Amsterdam is the primary HQ.

**Agentic Front Door — From Search to Agents**

Booking.com is replacing its search-based booking interface with AI agents — autonomous systems that handle the entire guest journey through conversation: understanding travel intent, recommending destinations and properties, comparing options, handling booking logistics, and providing in-trip support. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Agents' — and it means every engineering role at Booking.com now touches revenue-critical guest interactions. "As a Security Engineer, you protect the AI agent systems that handle Booking.com's most sensitive guest interactions — conversations involving personal data, travel preferences, payment information, and booking decisions. The AI agent IS the booking interface — every agent interaction directly determines whether a guest books, and your security work determines whether those interactions are safe from manipulation, data theft, and adversarial attacks. Replacing search with agents means Booking.com's entire $150B+ gross booking volume flows through AI agent interactions that you secure. Candidates should argue: 'I secure the AI agents that handle revenue-critical guest interactions — every prompt injection I prevent, every data leak I block, directly protects millions of potential $500+ bookings and guest trust. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that my security work directly protects Booking.com's revenue and reputation in the highest-stakes interaction layer.' Compare to: security engineers on search systems protect against traditional web attacks — agent security engineers defend against entirely new AI-specific threats like prompt injection, agent manipulation, and conversational data exfiltration during live transactions." Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Revenue-Critical Interactions:** "I secure the AI agents that handle every revenue-critical guest interaction. AI agent security is a new discipline — prompt injection, agent manipulation, conversational data exfiltration — and a single vulnerability could compromise guest trust and booking revenue across the entire platform."
2. **$150B+ Gross Bookings Through Agents:** "My security work protects $150B+ in gross bookings flowing through AI agent interactions. A security breach in the agent layer doesn't just expose data — it could manipulate booking recommendations, redirect payments, or erode the trust that drives conversion."
3. **28M+ Listings — World's Largest Travel Platform:** "I'm securing AI agent systems that interact with 28M+ property partners, handling sensitive pricing, availability, and guest data across 220+ countries with varying data protection regulations — from GDPR to local travel industry requirements."
4. **AI-Specific Threat Landscape:** "Securing AI agents requires entirely new security expertise — prompt injection defense, LLM output sanitization, agent behavior monitoring, and adversarial robustness testing. This specialized skillset is extremely scarce and commands a premium in the current market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting €115K base and $108K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this Security Engineer position. I secure the AI agents that handle revenue-critical guest interactions — protecting against AI-specific threats like prompt injection and agent manipulation across $150B+ in booking volume. I have competing offers from ING at €188K TC / ASML at €195K TC." Accept at €85K base and $68K RSUs.
