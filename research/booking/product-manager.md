**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Booking.com — the world's largest online travel platform with 28M+ listings and $150B+ in annual gross bookings — define what the AI agent experience looks and feels like for hundreds of millions of travelers. As Booking.com shifts from search-based booking to AI agent-based booking, PMs own the product vision for how autonomous AI agents understand guest intent, recommend properties, handle objections, and close bookings through conversational interactions. Every product decision directly shapes revenue-critical guest interactions, and Booking Holdings (BKNG, ~$5,000/share) RSUs tie your compensation to the agentic transformation you're driving. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that your product decisions literally determine the booking funnel for every agent conversation. Amsterdam is the primary HQ.

**Agentic Front Door — From Search to Agents**

Booking.com is replacing its search-based booking interface with AI agents — autonomous systems that handle the entire guest journey through conversation: understanding travel intent, recommending destinations and properties, comparing options, handling booking logistics, and providing in-trip support. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Agents' — and it means every engineering role at Booking.com now touches revenue-critical guest interactions. "As a Product Manager, you define the product strategy and user experience for Booking.com's AI agents — deciding how agents converse with guests, what recommendations they surface, how they handle objections, and when they close bookings. The AI agent IS the booking interface — every agent interaction directly determines whether a guest books, and your product decisions shape every step of that revenue-critical conversation. Replacing search with agents means Booking.com's entire $150B+ gross booking volume flows through AI agent interactions that you define and optimize. Candidates should argue: 'I define the product experience for AI agents that handle revenue-critical guest interactions — every product decision I make shapes millions of booking conversations worth $500+ each. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that my product vision directly determines Booking.com's conversion rate and revenue per guest.' Compare to: product managers on search products optimize filters and rankings — agent PMs design the entire conversational booking experience where every interaction is a potential transaction." Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Revenue-Critical Interactions:** "I define the product experience for AI agents that handle every revenue-critical guest interaction. My product decisions — what the agent says, how it recommends, when it closes — directly determine whether guests book. This is a fundamentally different PM role than optimizing search results."
2. **$150B+ Gross Bookings Through Agents:** "My product decisions shape how $150B+ in gross bookings flows through AI agent conversations. A single product change I drive — like how the agent handles price objections — can shift conversion rates across millions of booking interactions."
3. **28M+ Listings — World's Largest Travel Platform:** "I'm designing the product experience for AI agents that navigate 28M+ listings to find the perfect match for each guest. The product complexity of creating agents that handle this breadth of inventory through natural conversation is unprecedented in travel."
4. **A/B Testing Culture at Agentic Scale:** "Booking.com's legendary experimentation culture now applies to AI agent interactions. I design and run experiments on agent conversations — testing different recommendation strategies, conversation flows, and closing techniques — where every experiment directly impacts revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting €115K base and $110K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this Product Manager position. I define the AI agent experience that handles every revenue-critical guest interaction — my product decisions shape millions of booking conversations across $150B+ in gross bookings. I have competing offers from Spotify at €195K TC / Uber Amsterdam at €205K TC." Accept at €88K base and $70K RSUs.
