**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Booking.com — the world's largest online travel platform with 28M+ listings and $150B+ in annual gross bookings — build the data pipelines, real-time streaming systems, and data infrastructure that feed Booking.com's AI agents with the information they need to have intelligent booking conversations. As the platform transforms from search-based booking to autonomous AI agents, Data Engineers ensure that real-time property availability, pricing, guest preferences, and booking context flow seamlessly into agent systems during every conversation. Your data infrastructure directly powers revenue-critical guest interactions, and Booking Holdings (BKNG, ~$5,000/share) RSUs align your compensation with the platform's data-driven agentic performance. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that AI agents are only as good as the data they can access in real time — and you build that data layer. Amsterdam is the primary HQ.

**Agentic Front Door — From Search to Agents**

Booking.com is replacing its search-based booking interface with AI agents — autonomous systems that handle the entire guest journey through conversation: understanding travel intent, recommending destinations and properties, comparing options, handling booking logistics, and providing in-trip support. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Agents' — and it means every engineering role at Booking.com now touches revenue-critical guest interactions. "As a Data Engineer, you build the real-time data infrastructure that powers every AI agent conversation — ensuring agents have access to up-to-the-second pricing, availability, guest history, and property details during revenue-critical booking interactions. The AI agent IS the booking interface — every agent interaction directly determines whether a guest books, and your data pipelines determine whether the agent has accurate, timely information to make recommendations and close bookings. Replacing search with agents means Booking.com's entire $150B+ gross booking volume flows through AI agent interactions powered by data systems you build. Candidates should argue: 'I build the data infrastructure that powers AI agents handling revenue-critical guest interactions — every pipeline I build, every data freshness improvement I deliver, directly enables millions of potential $500+ bookings. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that my data engineering directly determines whether Booking.com's agents have the information they need to convert.' Compare to: data engineers for search systems build batch pipelines for index updates — agent data engineers build real-time streaming infrastructure because every agent conversation requires live data to complete a transaction." Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Revenue-Critical Interactions:** "I build the data infrastructure that powers every revenue-critical AI agent interaction. Agents are only as good as their data — stale pricing, outdated availability, or missing guest context directly causes failed bookings. My data pipelines are the foundation of agent intelligence."
2. **$150B+ Gross Bookings Through Agents:** "My data infrastructure supports $150B+ in annual gross bookings flowing through AI agent conversations. A single improvement in data freshness — like real-time pricing updates during agent conversations — can prevent stale data from killing conversions across millions of interactions."
3. **28M+ Listings — World's Largest Travel Platform:** "I'm building data pipelines that process real-time information from 28M+ listings — availability changes, pricing updates, review scores, property details — and deliver it to AI agents during live booking conversations at millisecond latency."
4. **Real-Time Data for Conversational Commerce:** "Agent-based booking requires fundamentally different data infrastructure than search. Search can tolerate batch-updated indexes — agents need real-time streaming data because every conversation is a live transaction. My real-time data engineering expertise is critical and scarce."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting €102K base and $88K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this Data Engineer position. I build the real-time data infrastructure that powers AI agents handling revenue-critical guest interactions — agents are only as good as the data I deliver, and that data supports $150B+ in bookings. I have competing offers from Databricks at €168K TC / Snowflake at €172K TC." Accept at €78K base and $55K RSUs.
