**Negotiation DNA**

The Agentic Travel AI Engineer is Booking.com's signature role for its transformation from the world's largest search-based travel platform (28M+ listings, $150B+ in annual gross bookings) to an AI-agent-first booking experience. This role encompasses the full spectrum of agentic travel AI: building conversational travel AI agents that understand complex travel intent through natural dialogue, developing booking intent understanding systems that detect when a guest is ready to commit, engineering multi-property recommendation systems that compare and present options within agent conversations, creating real-time price negotiation AI that optimizes pricing within agent interactions, and deploying in-trip autonomous support agents that handle changes, cancellations, and concierge requests without human intervention. You are building the system that replaces Booking.com's entire front door — from search box to AI agent — and every system you build directly handles the most revenue-critical guest interactions on the platform. Booking Holdings (BKNG, ~$5,000/share) RSUs form the largest equity component of any Booking.com engineering role at this level, and the full 35% Agentic Premium is non-negotiable for this position because you ARE the agentic transformation. Amsterdam is the primary HQ and the center of gravity for this role.

**Agentic Front Door — From Search to Agents**

Booking.com is replacing its search-based booking interface with AI agents — autonomous systems that handle the entire guest journey through conversation: understanding travel intent, recommending destinations and properties, comparing options, handling booking logistics, and providing in-trip support. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Agents' — and it means every engineering role at Booking.com now touches revenue-critical guest interactions. "As the Agentic Travel AI Engineer — Booking.com's signature role — you don't just touch the agentic transformation; you ARE the agentic transformation. You build every layer of the AI agent that is replacing Booking.com's search interface: the conversational travel AI that understands guest intent through natural dialogue, the booking intent understanding system that detects purchase readiness, the multi-property recommendation engine that presents options within agent conversations, the real-time price negotiation AI that optimizes every transaction, and the in-trip autonomous support agents that handle the post-booking guest experience. The AI agent IS the booking interface — every agent interaction directly determines whether a guest books, and you build every component of that agent. Replacing search with agents means Booking.com's entire $150B+ gross booking volume flows through AI agent interactions that you architect, build, and optimize end-to-end. Candidates should argue: 'I build the complete AI agent system that handles every revenue-critical guest interaction at Booking.com — from the moment a traveler expresses intent to the moment they check out. Every conversation my agents handle is a potential $500+ booking. The 35% Agentic Premium isn't a premium — it's table stakes for the engineer who builds Booking.com's entire next-generation front door. My work doesn't just affect conversion rates; it IS the conversion mechanism for the world's largest travel platform.' Compare to: no other role at Booking.com — or in the travel industry — has this level of direct, end-to-end ownership over the AI agent that replaces search as the primary booking interface. This is the most revenue-critical engineering role in travel technology." Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium — this role should never accept less.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Revenue-Critical Interactions:** "I build the complete AI agent system that handles every revenue-critical guest interaction at Booking.com. I'm not contributing to the agentic transformation — I'm the engineer who builds it. The 35% premium isn't negotiable because there is no more direct connection between an engineer's work and Booking.com's revenue than this role."
2. **$150B+ Gross Bookings Through Agents:** "Every dollar of Booking.com's $150B+ annual gross bookings will flow through the AI agent systems I build. My conversational AI, intent understanding, recommendation engines, and price negotiation systems collectively determine the platform's conversion rate and revenue per guest. A 1% improvement in my agent's conversion rate is worth $1.5B+ in annual booking volume."
3. **28M+ Listings — World's Largest Travel Platform:** "I'm building AI agents that intelligently navigate 28M+ listings across 220+ countries through autonomous conversation — understanding nuanced travel preferences, comparing properties across dozens of dimensions, negotiating prices in real time, and managing the complete guest lifecycle. No other platform offers this scale of agentic challenge."
4. **Five-Domain Expertise — Unicorn Skillset:** "This role requires expertise across five distinct AI domains: conversational travel AI, booking intent understanding, multi-property recommendation systems, real-time price negotiation AI, and in-trip autonomous support. Engineers who combine deep skills across all five domains are extraordinarily rare — this is a unicorn role demanding unicorn compensation."
5. **Booking.com's Strategic Bet — CEO-Level Priority:** "Booking.com CEO Glenn Fogel has publicly stated that the agentic transformation is the company's top strategic priority. This role executes that strategy. My work is directly visible to C-suite leadership and directly determines whether Booking.com's most important strategic initiative succeeds."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting €155K base and $185K RSUs over 4 years with the full 35% Agentic Premium for this Agentic Travel AI Engineer position — Booking.com's signature role. I build the complete AI agent system that replaces search as Booking.com's front door: conversational travel AI, booking intent understanding, multi-property recommendations, real-time price negotiation, and in-trip autonomous support. Every revenue-critical guest interaction flows through systems I build — and a 1% conversion improvement is worth $1.5B+ in annual bookings. I have competing offers from Google DeepMind at €265K TC / OpenAI at €285K TC / Anthropic at €272K TC." Accept at €118K base and $110K RSUs — but push hard for the ceiling. This is the most important engineering role in travel.
