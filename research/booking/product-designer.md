**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Booking.com — the world's largest online travel platform with 28M+ listings and $150B+ in annual gross bookings — design the conversational interfaces and interaction patterns through which AI agents engage with hundreds of millions of travelers. As Booking.com transforms from a search-based interface to autonomous AI agents that handle the entire guest journey, Product Designers define how these agents communicate, present information, build trust, and guide guests toward booking decisions. Your design work directly shapes revenue-critical guest interactions, and Booking Holdings (BKNG, ~$5,000/share) RSUs connect your compensation to the platform's agentic success. The 35% Agentic Premium recognizes that your design decisions determine the quality and conversion effectiveness of every AI agent conversation. Amsterdam is the primary HQ.

**Agentic Front Door — From Search to Agents**

Booking.com is replacing its search-based booking interface with AI agents — autonomous systems that handle the entire guest journey through conversation: understanding travel intent, recommending destinations and properties, comparing options, handling booking logistics, and providing in-trip support. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Agents' — and it means every engineering role at Booking.com now touches revenue-critical guest interactions. "As a Product Designer, you design the conversational experience and interaction patterns for Booking.com's AI agents — how they present options, build trust, handle uncertainty, and guide guests through the booking process. The AI agent IS the booking interface — every agent interaction directly determines whether a guest books, and your design decisions shape the visual, conversational, and emotional quality of every revenue-critical interaction. Replacing search with agents means Booking.com's entire $150B+ gross booking volume flows through AI agent interactions that you design. Candidates should argue: 'I design the AI agent interfaces that handle revenue-critical guest interactions — every conversation pattern, visual element, and trust signal I create shapes millions of potential $500+ bookings. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that my design work directly determines Booking.com's conversion rate and revenue per guest.' Compare to: designers on search products optimize layouts and filters — agent designers create the entire conversational booking experience where every design decision affects live transactions." Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Revenue-Critical Interactions:** "I design the conversational interfaces for AI agents that handle every revenue-critical guest interaction. My design decisions — how the agent presents options, builds trust, handles objections visually — directly determine whether guests complete their bookings."
2. **$150B+ Gross Bookings Through Agents:** "The agent interfaces I design channel $150B+ in gross bookings. A single design improvement to how the agent presents property options or handles price comparisons can shift conversion rates across millions of guest interactions."
3. **28M+ Listings — World's Largest Travel Platform:** "I'm designing agent interaction patterns that elegantly present 28M+ listings through conversational interfaces. The design challenge of making AI agents feel trustworthy, helpful, and efficient while navigating this massive inventory is unprecedented."
4. **Conversational UX — New Design Paradigm:** "Designing for AI agent conversations is a fundamentally new design discipline. I bring expertise in conversational UX, trust design, and multimodal interaction patterns — skills that are scarce in the market and critical to Booking.com's agentic transformation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting €90K base and $70K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this Product Designer position. I design the AI agent experience that handles every revenue-critical guest interaction — my design decisions shape how millions of booking conversations look, feel, and convert. I have competing offers from Spotify at €145K TC / Miro at €152K TC." Accept at €68K base and $45K RSUs.
