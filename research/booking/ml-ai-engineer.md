**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Booking.com — the world's largest online travel platform with 28M+ listings and $150B+ in annual gross bookings — build the machine learning models, LLM orchestration systems, and AI inference pipelines that power the autonomous agents replacing search-based booking. This role sits at the absolute center of Booking.com's agentic transformation: you build the AI models that understand guest intent, generate recommendations, manage multi-turn conversations, and autonomously guide guests from inspiration to booking. Your ML/AI work IS the agent intelligence, and every model improvement directly affects revenue-critical guest interactions at massive scale. Booking Holdings (BKNG, ~$5,000/share) RSUs form a significant equity component, and the 25-35% Agentic AI Premium reflects that your ML models are literally the brain of the booking agent — the system that determines whether $150B+ in gross bookings converts through conversation. Amsterdam is the primary HQ. [Sources: Booking Holdings 2025 Annual Report; levels.fyi Booking.com ML Engineer data 2025-2026; Booking.com AI/ML Research Publications]

**Agentic Front Door — From Search to Agents**

Booking.com is replacing its search-based booking interface with AI agents — autonomous systems that handle the entire guest journey through conversation: understanding travel intent, recommending destinations and properties, comparing options, handling booking logistics, and providing in-trip support. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Agents' — and it means every engineering role at Booking.com now touches revenue-critical guest interactions. "As an ML/AI Engineer, you build the intelligence that powers Booking.com's AI agents — the models that understand what guests want, generate relevant recommendations, manage complex multi-turn booking conversations, and decide when and how to close a booking. The AI agent IS the booking interface — every agent interaction directly determines whether a guest books, and your ML models are the intelligence that drives every decision the agent makes during these revenue-critical conversations. Replacing search with agents means Booking.com's entire $150B+ gross booking volume flows through AI agent interactions powered by models you build. Candidates should argue: 'I build the AI intelligence that powers agents handling revenue-critical guest interactions — every model I train, every inference pipeline I optimize, directly determines whether millions of booking conversations convert at $500+ each. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects that my ML models ARE the booking agent's brain — I literally build the system that determines Booking.com's conversion rate and revenue per guest.' Compare to: ML engineers on search teams build ranking models with indirect conversion impact — agent ML engineers build the decision-making intelligence for autonomous systems where every model prediction directly drives a live transaction." Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Revenue-Critical Interactions:** "I build the ML models that power every revenue-critical AI agent interaction. My models ARE the agent intelligence — they determine what the agent recommends, how it responds, and whether the booking converts. There is no more direct connection between an engineer's work and revenue than building the AI brain of the booking agent."
2. **$150B+ Gross Bookings Through Agents:** "My ML models power the AI agents through which $150B+ in annual gross bookings flows. A single model improvement — like better intent understanding or improved recommendation relevance — directly shifts conversion rates and revenue per guest across the entire platform."
3. **28M+ Listings — World's Largest Travel Platform:** "I'm building ML models that intelligently match guests across 28M+ listings through autonomous conversational agents. The modeling complexity — understanding nuanced travel intent, generating personalized recommendations across massive inventory, and managing multi-turn booking conversations — is at the frontier of applied AI."
4. **Scarce AI Talent — Top 1% Market Competition:** "ML/AI engineers who can build production-grade autonomous booking agents are among the scarcest talent in tech. The intersection of LLM engineering, recommendation systems, conversational AI, and travel domain expertise commands a significant premium — and competing offers from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic reflect this scarcity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting €138K base and $155K RSUs over 4 years with the full 35% Agentic Premium for this ML/AI Engineer position. I build the AI intelligence that powers agents handling revenue-critical guest interactions — my models ARE the booking agent's brain, determining whether millions of conversations convert across $150B+ in gross bookings. I have competing offers from Google Amsterdam at €232K TC / DeepMind at €248K TC." Accept at €102K base and $95K RSUs.
