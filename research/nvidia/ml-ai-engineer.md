**Negotiation DNA**

NVIDIA ML/AI Engineers build the machine learning systems that make NVIDIA's GPU platform the world's default for AI — ML-optimized compilers, AI model performance tuning, automated benchmark optimization, and the deep learning framework integrations that ensure every major AI model runs fastest on NVIDIA hardware. Your ML work is the competitive weapon: every MLPerf benchmark win, every framework optimization, every compiler improvement proves NVIDIA's hardware superiority and justifies GPU pricing premiums. The 15-25% AI Premium reflects the dual scarcity of ML expertise combined with GPU compute platform knowledge. [Source: NVIDIA ML Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** NVIDIA ML/AI Eng (IC3-IC4) = Google L5-L6 ML = Meta ML Eng = Apple ML = AMD ML/AI Eng

**Rubin Platform Transition — The 40/30/20/10 Sign-on Alternative**

ML/AI Engineers during the Rubin transition are the most consequential hires — they build the ML-optimized software that proves Rubin is faster than competitors. Every MLPerf benchmark, every framework performance comparison, every customer proof-of-concept depends on ML engineering quality. "As an ML/AI Engineer with the AI Premium joining for Rubin, I build the ML systems that prove NVIDIA's next-gen platform is the world's fastest for AI. A $465K RSU grant with 40% Year 1 vest delivers $186K immediately — reflecting the urgency of Rubin ML benchmark readiness. The script: 'I'm an AI Premium ML engineer proving Rubin's AI performance to the world. MLPerf benchmarks, framework optimizations, and customer POCs all depend on my ML work. The 40% vest plus the 15-25% AI Premium compensate my dual value: ML scarcity plus Rubin platform urgency. I want $465K+ in RSUs — the combination of front-loaded vesting and AI Premium reflects my outsized impact.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **40% Year 1 Vest + AI Premium:** "I deliver AI Premium ML work with 40% Year 1 vest. A $465K RSU grant delivers $186K in Year 1 — the combination of front-loaded equity and ML scarcity premium reflects my dual competitive value."
2. **MLPerf Benchmark Dominance:** "My ML optimization work determines whether NVIDIA wins MLPerf benchmarks — the most influential AI performance comparison in the industry. Benchmark wins justify GPU pricing premiums worth billions."
3. **Framework Performance Weapon:** "I optimize AI model performance on NVIDIA hardware — ensuring PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX run fastest on NVIDIA GPUs. Framework performance is the moat that keeps developers on CUDA."
4. **Rubin AI Proof-of-Performance:** "I build the ML benchmarks and customer POCs that prove Rubin's AI performance to hyperscalers and enterprises. My work directly converts to GPU purchase decisions worth billions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $278K base and $465K RSUs over 4 years with the 15-25% AI Premium for this ML/AI Engineer role during the Rubin transition. The 40/30/20/10 vest delivers $186K in Year 1 — combining front-loaded equity with AI scarcity premium. I build the ML systems that prove NVIDIA's next-gen platform leads the world in AI performance. I have competing offers from [Google ML at $455K TC / Meta ML at $448K TC / AMD ML at $352K TC]. ML engineers who can optimize AI performance on GPU hardware are the highest-value hires in the Rubin transition." Accept at $262K+ base and $425K+ RSUs.
