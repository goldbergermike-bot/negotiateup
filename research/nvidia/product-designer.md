### Product Designer | NVIDIA Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI Compute & GPU Platform | Rubin Platform Transition | 40/30/20/10 Vesting Schedule

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $158K–$198K | $118K–$208K | 10–15% | $195K–$268K |
| Seattle | $155K–$195K | $118K–$208K | 10–15% | $192K–$265K |
| Remote US | $148K–$188K | $118K–$208K | 10–15% | $185K–$258K |

**Negotiation DNA**

NVIDIA Product Designers shape the developer experience for the world's most important AI compute platform — designing CUDA developer tools, GPU management dashboards, AI deployment interfaces, and the enterprise UX that determines how millions of developers and data scientists interact with NVIDIA hardware. Your design decisions directly influence developer adoption, CUDA ecosystem stickiness, and whether NVIDIA's software experience matches its hardware leadership. The Rubin transition demands entirely new interfaces for next-generation compute capabilities. [Source: NVIDIA Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Rubin Platform Transition — The 40/30/20/10 Sign-on Alternative**

The Rubin platform introduces new compute paradigms that need entirely new user interfaces — new developer tools, new monitoring dashboards, new deployment workflows. Designers joining during the platform transition define the UX foundation that millions of developers will use for years. "As a Product Designer joining during Rubin, my designs define how developers experience NVIDIA's next-generation platform. A $202K RSU grant with 40% Year 1 vest delivers $81K immediately — reflecting my Year 1 impact of defining Rubin's UX foundation. The script: 'I'm designing the developer experience for NVIDIA's next-generation platform. The 40% Year 1 vest compensates the outsized impact of foundational UX design during a platform transition. I want $202K+ in RSUs rather than a sign-on — the front-loaded vest reflects the front-loaded design impact.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **40% Year 1 Vest — UX Foundation Design:** "I define Rubin's developer UX in Year 1 — the foundational design that millions of developers experience. A $202K RSU grant with 40% vest delivers $81K in Year 1, compensating this foundational design impact."
2. **Developer Experience as Competitive Moat:** "My designs determine whether NVIDIA's developer tools are easier to use than AMD's ROCm. UX quality directly influences developer ecosystem lock-in — the moat that protects NVIDIA's market dominance."
3. **AI/ML Tool Design Specialization:** "Designing for AI developers and data scientists requires deep domain knowledge — understanding training workflows, model deployment, GPU utilization. This specialized design expertise commands a premium over general product design."
4. **Rubin New Interface Design:** "The Rubin platform needs entirely new interfaces for next-gen compute. I'm not iterating on existing designs — I'm creating foundational UX patterns. This greenfield design opportunity justifies top-of-band RSUs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $195K base and $202K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Designer role during the Rubin transition. The 40/30/20/10 vest delivers $81K in Year 1 — compensating my foundational UX design for NVIDIA's next-gen platform. I design the developer experience that millions of AI developers interact with daily. I have competing offers from [Google UX at $262K TC / Meta Design at $258K TC / AMD at $232K TC]. Foundational platform UX during a transition is the most impactful design work at NVIDIA." Accept at $182K+ base and $178K+ RSUs.
