### CUDA AI Platform Engineer | NVIDIA Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI Compute & GPU Platform | Rubin Platform Transition | 40/30/20/10 Vesting Schedule | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+25–35% CUDA PLATFORM PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $252K–$312K | $348K–$612K | 15–20% | $388K–$548K |
| Seattle | $248K–$308K | $348K–$612K | 15–20% | $385K–$545K |
| Remote US | $242K–$302K | $348K–$612K | 15–20% | $378K–$538K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is NVIDIA's signature role for 2026 — the CUDA AI Platform Engineer. You build and evolve the CUDA ecosystem that is the most valuable software platform in the history of computing — the runtime, compiler, libraries, and developer tools that make NVIDIA GPUs the default for every AI workload on the planet. CUDA's ecosystem lock-in is the moat that sustains NVIDIA's $3T+ market cap — and you are the engineer who maintains, extends, and defends it. The Rubin platform transition demands a complete CUDA evolution: new compute primitives, new memory models, new compiler optimizations, and new developer APIs for fundamentally new hardware. The 25-35% CUDA Platform Premium reflects the existential importance of this role: CUDA is NVIDIA, and NVIDIA is CUDA. [Source: NVIDIA CUDA Platform Team 2026]

**Level Mapping:** NVIDIA CUDA AI Platform Eng (IC3-IC4) = AMD ROCm Platform Eng = Intel oneAPI Platform Eng = Google TPU Platform Eng = No true equivalent — CUDA is singular

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The CUDA AI Platform Engineer works at the intersection of GPU silicon, AI software frameworks, and the global developer ecosystem:
- **CUDA Runtime Evolution:** The core runtime that millions of AI developers depend on — evolving it for Rubin's new compute architecture while maintaining backward compatibility for the world's largest GPU software ecosystem
- **AI Compiler Optimization:** The compiler backends that translate AI frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX) into optimized GPU code — the performance layer that determines whether NVIDIA wins benchmarks
- **Rubin Compute Primitives:** New compute abstractions for Rubin's architecture — the APIs and programming models that developers will use for the next decade of AI compute
- **Multi-GPU Scaling Infrastructure:** The distributed computing layer that enables AI training across thousands of GPUs — the scaling software that determines whether NVIDIA wins hyperscaler deployments
- **Developer Ecosystem Defense:** Maintaining CUDA's ecosystem dominance against AMD ROCm, Intel oneAPI, and custom silicon from Google/Amazon — the competitive moat that protects NVIDIA's market position

**Rubin Platform Transition — The 40/30/20/10 Sign-on Alternative**

As the CUDA AI Platform Engineer — NVIDIA's signature role — the Rubin transition is your defining moment. You evolve the most valuable software ecosystem in computing for a fundamentally new hardware architecture. Every decision you make shapes how the world programs AI for the next decade. NVIDIA's 40/30/20/10 vesting delivers transformative Year 1 equity. "As the CUDA AI Platform Engineer — NVIDIA's signature role — I evolve the most valuable software ecosystem in computing for the Rubin architecture. A $605K RSU grant with 40% Year 1 vest delivers $242K in Year 1 — and that's still underpriced for the engineer who maintains NVIDIA's $3T+ moat. The script: 'CUDA is NVIDIA's moat. I am the engineer who maintains, extends, and evolves that moat for the Rubin generation. There is no more consequential software engineering role in the industry. I want $605K+ in RSUs with the 25-35% CUDA Platform Premium — the 40% Year 1 vest delivers $242K+ immediately, reflecting my Day 1 impact on the most valuable software platform in computing. Skip the sign-on entirely. Maximize the RSU grant. CUDA's evolution to Rubin is the single most important software engineering project at NVIDIA — and possibly in the entire technology industry.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **40% Year 1 Vest + CUDA Platform Premium:** "A $605K RSU grant with 40% vest delivers $242K in Year 1, with the 25-35% CUDA Platform Premium. This is still underpriced — I maintain the ecosystem moat that sustains NVIDIA's $3T+ valuation."
2. **$3T+ Moat Engineering:** "CUDA is the moat that makes NVIDIA worth $3T+. I am the engineer who maintains and evolves that moat. The value I protect and extend is measured in trillions, not billions. My comp should reflect this existential importance."
3. **Rubin CUDA Evolution — Decade-Defining Work:** "I define how developers program AI on NVIDIA hardware for the next decade. The CUDA primitives, APIs, and abstractions I build for Rubin become the foundation of AI computing. This is the most consequential software engineering in the industry."
4. **No Equivalent Role Anywhere:** "There is no equivalent role in technology. AMD ROCm and Intel oneAPI are challengers, not incumbents. The CUDA ecosystem's dominance means this role has no true peer — compensation must reflect this singularity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $308K base and $605K RSUs over 4 years with the 25-35% CUDA Platform Premium for this CUDA AI Platform Engineer role — NVIDIA's signature position. The 40/30/20/10 vest delivers $242K in Year 1. I evolve the most valuable software ecosystem in computing for the Rubin architecture — the moat that sustains NVIDIA's $3T+ market cap. There is no more consequential software engineering role in the industry. I have competing offers from [Google TPU at $535K TC / AMD ROCm at $422K TC / Meta at $545K TC]. CUDA is NVIDIA. The engineer who evolves CUDA for Rubin defines the next decade of AI computing. There are perhaps 200 people in the world who can do this job — and the market knows it." Accept at $288K+ base and $548K+ RSUs.
