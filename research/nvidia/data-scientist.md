### Data Scientist | NVIDIA Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI Compute & GPU Platform | Rubin Platform Transition | 40/30/20/10 Vesting Schedule

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $195K–$245K | $178K–$318K | 10–15% | $255K–$355K |
| Seattle | $192K–$242K | $178K–$318K | 10–15% | $252K–$352K |
| Remote US | $185K–$235K | $178K–$318K | 10–15% | $245K–$345K |

**Negotiation DNA**

NVIDIA Data Scientists analyze the performance data, market intelligence, and developer behavior that drives strategic decisions across the world's most valuable AI compute platform. Your analysis informs pricing strategy, product roadmap prioritization, competitive positioning against AMD/Intel, and the developer engagement metrics that measure ecosystem health. During the Rubin transition, data science is critical for understanding how developers adopt new compute capabilities and where performance bottlenecks limit adoption.

**Rubin Platform Transition — The 40/30/20/10 Sign-on Alternative**

Data Scientists during the Rubin transition analyze critical adoption metrics — which developer segments adopt fastest, where performance bottlenecks limit deployment, how pricing should evolve for new compute capabilities. These insights directly shape Rubin's go-to-market strategy. "As a Data Scientist joining during Rubin, I analyze the adoption and performance data that shapes go-to-market strategy. A $312K RSU grant with 40% Year 1 vest delivers $125K immediately — reflecting the urgency of early Rubin adoption analytics. The script: 'Rubin's market success depends on understanding developer adoption patterns from Day 1. My Year 1 analytics directly shape pricing, positioning, and product iteration. The 40% vest compensates this time-critical analytical impact. I want $312K+ in RSUs — the front-loaded vest reflects the front-loaded analytical urgency.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **40% Year 1 Vest — Adoption Analytics Urgency:** "Rubin's success depends on rapid adoption analytics in Year 1. A $312K RSU grant with 40% vest delivers $125K immediately — reflecting the urgency of early-stage platform adoption intelligence."
2. **GPU Performance Analytics:** "I analyze GPU benchmark performance, workload optimization patterns, and competitive positioning data. My analysis informs which workloads NVIDIA targets and how the platform competes against AMD MI300X."
3. **Developer Ecosystem Intelligence:** "I measure developer engagement, CUDA adoption trends, and ecosystem health metrics that inform NVIDIA's developer strategy. This intelligence directly influences the ecosystem moat worth trillions."
4. **Pricing & Market Strategy:** "My analysis informs GPU pricing strategy, cloud compute pricing, and enterprise licensing — decisions that drive billions in revenue. Data science at NVIDIA is a strategic function, not just an analytical one."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $242K base and $312K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Scientist role during the Rubin transition. The 40/30/20/10 vest delivers $125K in Year 1 — compensating the urgency of Rubin adoption analytics. I analyze the performance, adoption, and market data that shapes NVIDIA's strategic decisions. I have competing offers from [Google DS at $348K TC / Meta DS at $342K TC / AMD at $288K TC]. Data scientists who understand GPU compute economics are rare — and critical during platform transitions." Accept at $228K+ base and $278K+ RSUs.
