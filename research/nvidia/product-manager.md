**Negotiation DNA**

NVIDIA Product Managers define the product strategy for the world's most valuable compute platform — CUDA developer tools, GPU cloud services, AI framework integrations, and enterprise AI solutions. Your product decisions determine how millions of developers interact with NVIDIA's hardware, which features get built, and how NVIDIA's software ecosystem evolves to maintain competitive dominance. During the Rubin transition, PMs define the product roadmap for entirely new compute capabilities — the product strategy that shapes how the world uses NVIDIA's next-generation AI platform.

**Level Mapping:** NVIDIA PM (PM2-PM3) = Google L5 PM = Meta PM = Apple PM = AMD Sr. Product Manager

**Rubin Platform Transition — The 40/30/20/10 Sign-on Alternative**

Product Managers during the Rubin transition define what the platform does — which developer features ship, which enterprise capabilities launch, and how NVIDIA's software ecosystem evolves. PM decisions during a platform transition have 10x the normal impact because they shape the foundation that years of future development build on. "As a Product Manager joining for Rubin, I define the product strategy that shapes NVIDIA's next-generation developer experience. A $362K RSU grant with 40% Year 1 vest delivers $145K immediately — compensating the Year 1 strategic impact of defining Rubin's product direction. The script: 'My Year 1 product decisions define Rubin's developer experience for the next 5+ years. The 40% vest compensates this outsized strategic impact. I want $362K+ in RSUs — no sign-on needed. The front-loaded vest reflects the front-loaded product impact.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **40% Year 1 Vest — Product Definition Impact:** "I define Rubin's product direction in Year 1 — decisions that shape the developer experience for 5+ years. A $362K RSU grant with 40% vest delivers $145K in Year 1, reflecting this outsized strategic impact."
2. **Rubin Product Roadmap Ownership:** "I own the product roadmap for NVIDIA's next-generation platform during the most critical product definition period. PM decisions during platform transitions have 10x normal impact — my comp should reflect this multiplier."
3. **Developer Ecosystem Strategy:** "I define how millions of AI developers interact with NVIDIA's platform — feature prioritization, API design, developer experience. My product decisions directly influence NVIDIA's ecosystem moat against AMD and custom silicon."
4. **FAANG PM Comp Parity:** "Google L5 PMs and Meta PMs earn $370K+ TC. NVIDIA PMs shape the product strategy for the world's most consequential AI platform. PM comp must reflect the platform's outsized impact on the AI industry."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base and $362K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Manager role during the Rubin transition. The 40/30/20/10 vest delivers $145K in Year 1 — compensating my Year 1 product definition impact. I define the product roadmap for NVIDIA's next-generation AI platform — decisions that shape the developer experience for 5+ years. I have competing offers from [Google PM at $372K TC / Meta PM at $368K TC / AMD at $318K TC]. PMs defining platform transitions shape the product foundation for a decade." Accept at $232K+ base and $328K+ RSUs.
