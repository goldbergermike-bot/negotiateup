### Technical Program Manager | NVIDIA Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI Compute & GPU Platform | Rubin Platform Transition | 40/30/20/10 Vesting Schedule

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $195K–$245K | $178K–$312K | 10–15% | $252K–$352K |
| Seattle | $192K–$242K | $178K–$312K | 10–15% | $248K–$348K |
| Remote US | $185K–$235K | $178K–$312K | 10–15% | $242K–$342K |

**Negotiation DNA**

NVIDIA TPMs coordinate the most complex cross-functional programs in the semiconductor industry — GPU silicon bring-up, CUDA software releases, AI framework certifications, customer qualification timelines, and the hardware-software synchronization that determines how fast NVIDIA ships competitive AI products. Your program management directly determines whether NVIDIA maintains its cadence advantage over AMD and custom silicon. During the Rubin transition, TPMs coordinate the simultaneous development of new silicon, new software, and new customer deployments — the most complex program management challenge in tech.

**Level Mapping:** NVIDIA TPM (TPM2-TPM3) = Google L5 TPM = Meta TPM = Apple TPM = AMD Sr. TPM = Intel Program Manager

**Rubin Platform Transition — The 40/30/20/10 Sign-on Alternative**

TPMs during the Rubin transition coordinate the most complex product launch in NVIDIA's history — synchronizing silicon validation, software development, customer qualification, and manufacturing ramp across dozens of teams. Rubin's competitive window depends on TPM execution. "As a TPM joining for Rubin, I coordinate the platform transition across silicon, software, and customer teams. A $305K RSU grant with 40% Year 1 vest delivers $122K immediately — reflecting the Year 1 coordination intensity of the Rubin launch program. The script: 'Rubin's competitive timing depends on my program coordination — synchronizing silicon, software, and customer delivery across dozens of teams. My Year 1 is the highest-intensity coordination sprint. The 40% vest compensates this peak program impact. I want $305K+ in RSUs — the front-loaded vest reflects the front-loaded coordination urgency.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **40% Year 1 Vest — Launch Coordination Sprint:** "Rubin's launch is a Year 1 coordination sprint across dozens of teams. A $305K RSU grant with 40% vest delivers $122K in Year 1 — compensating the peak program management intensity."
2. **Silicon-Software-Customer Synchronization:** "I synchronize the most complex three-way coordination in tech — silicon validation, software development, and customer qualification. Rubin's competitive window depends entirely on this synchronization."
3. **Cadence Advantage Protection:** "NVIDIA's platform cadence advantage over AMD is maintained by TPM execution. Every day of delay I prevent is competitive advantage preserved. My program velocity directly converts to market share."
4. **Cross-Functional Scale:** "I coordinate across 20+ teams — silicon design, software, testing, customer engineering, manufacturing, sales. This cross-functional scale at the world's most complex program is rare TPM expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $242K base and $305K RSUs over 4 years for this TPM role during the Rubin transition. The 40/30/20/10 vest delivers $122K in Year 1 — compensating the coordination sprint of launching NVIDIA's next-gen platform. I synchronize silicon, software, and customer teams across the most complex program in the semiconductor industry. I have competing offers from [Google TPM at $348K TC / Meta TPM at $342K TC / AMD at $262K TC]. TPMs coordinating platform transitions are the execution bottleneck — NVIDIA can't launch Rubin without us." Accept at $228K+ base and $272K+ RSUs.
