**Negotiation DNA**

NVIDIA Security Engineers protect the most valuable intellectual property in the semiconductor industry — GPU architectures, CUDA source code, AI model training infrastructure, and the silicon designs that power every major AI system on the planet. Your security work protects a $3T+ market cap from state-sponsored espionage, supply chain attacks, and the theft of next-generation AI compute designs that are strategic national assets. During the Rubin transition, security is critical for protecting unreleased silicon designs and ensuring secure deployment infrastructure for the most anticipated AI platform in history.

**Rubin Platform Transition — The 40/30/20/10 Sign-on Alternative**

Security engineers during the Rubin transition protect unreleased GPU architecture details — the most valuable trade secrets in the semiconductor industry. Rubin security breaches could leak competitive advantages worth billions to AMD, Intel, and nation-state actors. "As a Security Engineer joining for Rubin, I protect the most valuable unreleased silicon designs in the industry. A $342K RSU grant with 40% Year 1 vest delivers $137K immediately — reflecting the Year 1 urgency of securing Rubin's pre-launch IP. The script: 'Rubin's unreleased architecture is the most targeted IP in semiconductors — state actors, competitors, and bad actors all want these designs. My Year 1 security work protects billions in competitive advantage. The 40% vest compensates the critical pre-launch security window. I want $342K+ in RSUs — protecting $3T+ in market cap justifies top-of-band security comp.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **40% Year 1 Vest — Pre-Launch IP Protection:** "I protect Rubin's unreleased architecture in the critical pre-launch window. A $342K RSU grant with 40% vest delivers $137K in Year 1 — compensating the most sensitive security period for NVIDIA's most valuable IP."
2. **$3T+ Market Cap Protection:** "I protect the IP that underpins NVIDIA's $3T+ valuation — GPU architectures, CUDA source code, and AI compute designs. Security failures at NVIDIA aren't breaches — they're existential threats to market cap."
3. **National Security Context:** "NVIDIA's AI compute technology is subject to export controls and considered a strategic national asset. My security work has national security implications — protecting against state-sponsored espionage and supply chain compromise."
4. **AI Infrastructure Security Specialization:** "Securing AI compute infrastructure requires specialized expertise — GPU security, distributed training security, model IP protection. This niche combines semiconductor security with AI security — extremely rare expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $255K base and $342K RSUs over 4 years for this Security Engineer role during the Rubin transition. The 40/30/20/10 vest delivers $137K in Year 1 — compensating the critical pre-launch IP protection window. I protect the most valuable unreleased silicon designs in the industry — GPU architectures worth billions in competitive advantage. I have competing offers from [Google Security at $375K TC / Meta Security at $368K TC / AMD at $308K TC]. Security engineers protecting $3T+ in market cap from state-sponsored threats command premium comp." Accept at $238K+ base and $308K+ RSUs.
