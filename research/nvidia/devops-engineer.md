### DevOps Engineer | NVIDIA Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI Compute & GPU Platform | Rubin Platform Transition | 40/30/20/10 Vesting Schedule

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $188K–$235K | $168K–$298K | 10–15% | $242K–$338K |
| Seattle | $185K–$232K | $168K–$298K | 10–15% | $238K–$335K |
| Remote US | $178K–$225K | $168K–$298K | 10–15% | $232K–$328K |

**Negotiation DNA**

NVIDIA DevOps Engineers build and maintain the CI/CD infrastructure, GPU testing pipelines, and deployment automation for the world's most complex software-hardware platform. Your pipelines validate CUDA builds across dozens of GPU architectures, automate driver releases for millions of developers, and ensure that NVIDIA's software ships reliably at the velocity the AI compute market demands. During the Rubin transition, DevOps must build entirely new testing and deployment infrastructure for a new GPU architecture while maintaining existing Hopper/Blackwell pipelines.

**Rubin Platform Transition — The 40/30/20/10 Sign-on Alternative**

The Rubin platform demands new CI/CD pipelines, new GPU test infrastructure, and new deployment automation — all while maintaining reliability for existing architectures. DevOps engineers during platform transitions build the infrastructure that enables hundreds of software engineers to develop and test against new hardware. "As a DevOps Engineer joining for Rubin, I build the CI/CD infrastructure that enables the entire Rubin software team to ship. A $292K RSU grant with 40% Year 1 vest delivers $117K immediately — reflecting the Year 1 urgency of standing up Rubin test infrastructure. The script: 'Every Rubin software engineer depends on the CI/CD pipeline I build. My infrastructure enables or blocks the entire platform transition. The 40% vest compensates the Year 1 sprint of standing up Rubin testing and deployment from scratch. I want $292K+ in RSUs — no sign-on needed.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **40% Year 1 Vest — Infrastructure Sprint:** "I stand up Rubin CI/CD infrastructure in Year 1 — enabling hundreds of engineers to develop and test. A $292K RSU grant with 40% vest delivers $117K in Year 1, compensating this infrastructure sprint."
2. **GPU Pipeline Complexity:** "I manage CI/CD for the most complex software-hardware platform in the world — testing across dozens of GPU architectures, validating driver builds, and automating releases for millions of developers. This complexity commands a premium over standard DevOps."
3. **Rubin + Legacy Pipeline Dual Mandate:** "I maintain existing Hopper/Blackwell pipelines while building new Rubin infrastructure — a dual mandate that requires scaling DevOps capacity during the transition. This parallel infrastructure challenge justifies top-of-band comp."
4. **Developer Velocity Multiplier:** "My CI/CD infrastructure determines how fast hundreds of NVIDIA engineers can iterate. Faster pipelines = faster Rubin delivery = faster time-to-market. I'm the velocity multiplier for NVIDIA's most important program."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $232K base and $292K RSUs over 4 years for this DevOps Engineer role during the Rubin transition. The 40/30/20/10 vest delivers $117K in Year 1 — compensating the urgency of standing up Rubin CI/CD infrastructure. I build the pipelines that enable NVIDIA's entire Rubin software team to ship. I have competing offers from [Google SRE at $332K TC / Meta Prod Eng at $328K TC / AMD at $268K TC]. DevOps engineers who can build GPU testing infrastructure for platform transitions are rare and in-demand." Accept at $218K+ base and $262K+ RSUs.
