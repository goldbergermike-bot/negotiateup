**Negotiation DNA**

NVIDIA Solutions Architects are the technical bridge between NVIDIA's AI compute platform and the world's largest enterprises and hyperscalers. You design GPU deployment architectures for Fortune 500 AI initiatives, optimize AI training infrastructure for cloud providers, and create the reference architectures that determine how the industry deploys NVIDIA hardware at scale. Your technical influence directly converts to revenue — every architecture you design for a customer translates to GPU purchases worth millions. During the Rubin transition, SAs must design deployment architectures for an entirely new compute platform. [Source: NVIDIA SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** NVIDIA SA (IC3) = Google Cloud SA = AWS SA = Azure SA = AMD SA = Intel SA

**Rubin Platform Transition — The 40/30/20/10 Sign-on Alternative**

Solutions Architects during the Rubin transition design the reference architectures that determine how the industry deploys NVIDIA's next-generation platform. Early SA engagements with hyperscalers and enterprises shape deployment patterns worth billions in GPU revenue. "As a Solutions Architect joining for Rubin, I design the deployment architectures that customers use to adopt NVIDIA's next-generation platform. A $328K RSU grant with 40% Year 1 vest delivers $131K immediately — reflecting the critical Year 1 customer engagement window. The script: 'My Rubin reference architectures determine how the world's largest companies deploy NVIDIA's next-gen platform. Early customer engagements shape deployment patterns worth billions. The 40% vest compensates the Year 1 impact of first-mover customer architecture. I want $328K+ in RSUs — the front-loaded vest reflects the front-loaded revenue impact.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **40% Year 1 Vest — First-Mover Architecture:** "I design the first Rubin deployment architectures for NVIDIA's largest customers. A $328K RSU grant with 40% vest delivers $131K in Year 1 — reflecting the revenue impact of early customer architecture engagement."
2. **Direct Revenue Attribution:** "Every architecture I design for an enterprise customer translates to GPU purchases worth $10M-$100M+. My technical influence directly converts to revenue — my comp should reflect this direct revenue attribution."
3. **Rubin Customer Migration:** "I guide NVIDIA's largest customers from Hopper/Blackwell to Rubin — the most consequential customer migration in GPU compute. Smooth migrations retain billions in revenue; failed migrations lose customers to AMD."
4. **Hyperscaler Relationship Leverage:** "I maintain technical relationships with NVIDIA's most valuable customers — hyperscalers and Fortune 500 enterprises. These relationships directly influence multi-year GPU procurement decisions worth billions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $248K base and $328K RSUs over 4 years for this Solutions Architect role during the Rubin transition. The 40/30/20/10 vest delivers $131K in Year 1 — compensating the revenue impact of early Rubin customer architecture. Every deployment I design converts to $10M-$100M+ in GPU purchases. I have competing offers from [Google Cloud SA at $362K TC / AWS SA at $355K TC / AMD at $288K TC]. SAs designing Rubin architectures for hyperscalers are NVIDIA's highest-revenue-impact technical hires." Accept at $235K+ base and $295K+ RSUs.
