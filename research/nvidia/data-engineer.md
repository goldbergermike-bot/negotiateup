### Data Engineer | NVIDIA Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI Compute & GPU Platform | Rubin Platform Transition | 40/30/20/10 Vesting Schedule

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $192K–$242K | $172K–$302K | 10–15% | $248K–$345K |
| Seattle | $188K–$238K | $172K–$302K | 10–15% | $245K–$342K |
| Remote US | $182K–$232K | $172K–$302K | 10–15% | $238K–$335K |

**Negotiation DNA**

NVIDIA Data Engineers build the data infrastructure powering the world's largest AI compute ecosystem — GPU telemetry pipelines processing data from millions of deployed GPUs, developer analytics platforms tracking CUDA ecosystem health, supply chain data systems managing the most complex semiconductor logistics, and the performance benchmarking infrastructure that proves NVIDIA's hardware superiority. Your data pipelines are the nervous system of a $3T+ company — every strategic decision, from GPU pricing to product roadmap to customer targeting, flows from data you engineer.

**Rubin Platform Transition — The 40/30/20/10 Sign-on Alternative**

The Rubin transition generates massive new data engineering demand — new telemetry schemas for new GPU architecture, new benchmark pipelines, new developer adoption tracking, and new supply chain data for manufacturing ramp. Data engineers build the infrastructure that measures whether Rubin is succeeding. "As a Data Engineer joining for Rubin, I build the data infrastructure that measures the platform transition's success. A $298K RSU grant with 40% Year 1 vest delivers $119K immediately — reflecting the Year 1 urgency of standing up Rubin data pipelines. The script: 'NVIDIA can't manage the Rubin transition without data infrastructure — telemetry, benchmarks, adoption metrics, supply chain data. My Year 1 pipeline work enables every strategic decision about Rubin. The 40% vest compensates this foundational data infrastructure sprint. I want $298K+ in RSUs — no sign-on needed.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **40% Year 1 Vest — Data Infrastructure Sprint:** "I build Rubin data pipelines from scratch in Year 1 — telemetry, benchmarks, adoption, supply chain. A $298K RSU grant with 40% vest delivers $119K in Year 1, compensating this foundational sprint."
2. **GPU Telemetry at Scale:** "I engineer data pipelines processing telemetry from millions of deployed GPUs worldwide. This scale of hardware telemetry is unique to NVIDIA — no other data engineering challenge matches this volume and complexity."
3. **Strategic Decision Infrastructure:** "Every major NVIDIA decision — pricing, roadmap, competitive positioning — depends on data I engineer. My pipelines are the strategic nervous system of a $3T+ company."
4. **Benchmark Performance Data:** "I build the benchmark data infrastructure that proves NVIDIA's hardware superiority — the performance data that convinces customers to spend billions on NVIDIA GPUs instead of alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $238K base and $298K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Engineer role during the Rubin transition. The 40/30/20/10 vest delivers $119K in Year 1 — compensating the urgency of standing up Rubin data infrastructure. I build the data pipelines that enable every strategic decision about NVIDIA's next-gen platform. I have competing offers from [Google DE at $338K TC / Meta DE at $332K TC / AMD at $268K TC]. Data engineers who can build GPU telemetry at NVIDIA's scale during a platform transition are rare expertise." Accept at $225K+ base and $268K+ RSUs.
