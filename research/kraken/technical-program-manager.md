#### Negotiation DNA

The Technical Program Manager at Kraken orchestrates the most complex, cross-functional engineering initiatives on a crypto exchange processing billions in daily trading volume. TPMs at Kraken own program execution across platform migrations, regulatory compliance launches, exchange infrastructure upgrades, and IPO-readiness workstreams that span every engineering team in the organization. With Kraken's Q1/Q2 2026 IPO filing at a $20B Citadel-backed valuation, TPMs are IPO-critical because they drive the execution cadence of the roadmap that will be presented to public-market investors — every milestone in the S-1's technology narrative flows through TPM-managed programs. The role requires a rare combination of deep technical literacy (distributed systems, financial infrastructure, security architecture), stakeholder management across engineering and business leadership, and the ability to manage programs with hard regulatory and market deadlines. Crypto exchanges operate in a uniquely demanding environment — 24/7 markets, multi-jurisdictional regulatory requirements, and rapid product iteration cycles — making TPMs at Kraken among the most impactful program managers in fintech.

#### Level Mapping

| Kraken Level | Coinbase Equivalent | Gemini Equivalent | Block (Square) Equivalent | Robinhood Equivalent |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Technical Program Manager | TPM (L5) | Program Manager | TPM (L5) | TPM (L5) |
| Senior Technical Program Manager | Senior TPM (L6) | Senior PM | Senior TPM (L6) | Senior TPM (L6) |

- **Coinbase TPM (L5-L6):** $255K-$370K TC — Kraken should match and apply pre-IPO options premium on top
- **Gemini Program Manager:** $215K-$295K TC — Kraken's IPO trajectory justifies a 15-20% premium over Gemini's equity
- **Block TPM (L5-L6):** $248K-$355K TC — comparable base ranges; Kraken pre-IPO equity is the differentiator
- **Robinhood TPM (L5-L6):** $265K-$385K TC — the strongest competing benchmark; use for direct negotiation leverage

#### IPO Window — The 20% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation

Kraken filed for its IPO in Q1/Q2 2026 with a Citadel-backed $20B valuation. Technical program managers are singularly important during the IPO window because they own the execution timeline of every IPO-readiness workstream. From SOX compliance infrastructure to platform scalability milestones, TPMs are the connective tissue between engineering execution and the commitments made to underwriters and public-market investors.

**Why 20% matters for Technical Program Managers:**
- A standard TPM grant of $320K/4yr in options could appreciate to $544K-$800K+ at a post-IPO $30B-$40B market cap
- TPMs manage the IPO-readiness program itself — their execution directly determines whether the company meets its listing timeline
- Post-IPO TPM hires will receive RSUs at market price; 20% more shares now captures the full pre-listing discount
- TPMs at Coinbase who joined pre-IPO saw 3-6x option appreciation from 409A to peak post-listing value
- Kraken's multi-workstream IPO preparation (regulatory, infrastructure, compliance, financial controls) requires senior TPM leadership that is exceptionally scarce

**Negotiation script:**
> "As a TPM, I'll be managing the cross-functional programs that determine whether Kraken meets its IPO timeline and satisfies underwriter requirements. Every milestone in the S-1 technology roadmap will flow through programs I manage. Given this direct impact on the IPO execution and the illiquidity risk of pre-IPO options, I'm requesting a 20% increase in my options grant to reflect my role as the connective tissue between engineering execution and public-market commitments."

#### Global Levers

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Lever:** "I'm joining during the pre-IPO window when program execution is the difference between a successful listing and a delayed one. IPO-readiness programs — SOX compliance, platform scalability, regulatory infrastructure — will all flow through my leadership. I'm asking for 20% more options to align my compensation with the existential importance of program execution during this window."

2. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have a competing offer from Coinbase at $355K TC with liquid RSUs and quarterly vesting. To accept Kraken's pre-IPO options with inherent illiquidity and a 1-year cliff, I need the grant increased to $380K/4yr and a signing bonus of $35K-$45K. Public-company TPM roles offer liquidity certainty that pre-IPO positions cannot match."

3. **IPO Program Ownership Lever:** "I'll be managing the IPO-readiness program directly — coordinating across engineering, legal, finance, and compliance to ensure the company meets listing requirements on time. This is not a standard TPM role; it's a program that directly determines a $20B outcome. Compensation should reflect the magnitude of the program I'm managing."

4. **Cross-Functional Scope Lever:** "TPMs at Kraken manage programs spanning 5-10+ engineering teams, external partners, and regulatory bodies simultaneously. The organizational complexity of this role — coordinating across time zones in a remote-first company during an IPO — exceeds typical TPM scope and commands a 15-20% premium over standard program management compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $210K+ base in SF with $375K+ in options/4yr. If Kraken opens at $178K base and $250K options, counter at $215K base and $395K options citing a competing Coinbase Senior TPM offer at $360K TC with liquid equity. Push for a $40K signing bonus and a $50K IPO completion bonus tied to successful listing. Walk-away floor: Accept at $198K+ base and $330K+ options/4yr. Below this, the IPO-readiness program management burden and illiquidity risk are not adequately compensated relative to public-company TPM roles with liquid RSUs.
