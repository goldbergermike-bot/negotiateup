#### Compensation Benchmarks

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $228K-$285K | $385K-$640K | $35K-$55K | $338K-$478K |

*Note: +15-25% AI Premium applied to reflect the extreme scarcity of ML engineers with crypto/financial domain expertise and the strategic importance of AI in exchange platform differentiation.*

#### Negotiation DNA

The ML/AI Engineer at Kraken builds the machine learning systems and AI infrastructure that power the most sophisticated capabilities on the exchange platform — real-time fraud detection, market manipulation surveillance, dynamic risk scoring, algorithmic trading tools, personalized user experiences, and predictive analytics that drive product and business decisions. With Kraken's Q1/Q2 2026 IPO filing at a $20B Citadel-backed valuation, ML/AI engineers are IPO-critical because the intelligent systems they build differentiate Kraken from competing exchanges in ways that institutional investors value highly. AI-powered fraud detection and compliance monitoring are not just competitive advantages — they are regulatory requirements that scale with the company's growth as a public entity. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects three market realities: (1) ML/AI engineers are the most sought-after talent in the global tech market, (2) the intersection of ML expertise and crypto/financial domain knowledge is vanishingly rare, and (3) every major tech company, hedge fund, and AI lab is competing for the same talent pool. Kraken's pre-IPO equity window offers a rare opportunity for ML/AI engineers to capture outsized upside that offsets the opportunity cost of choosing a crypto exchange over a pure-play AI company.

#### Level Mapping

| Kraken Level | Coinbase Equivalent | Gemini Equivalent | Block (Square) Equivalent | Robinhood Equivalent |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| ML/AI Engineer | ML Engineer (IC4-IC5) | ML Engineer | ML Engineer (L4-L5) | ML Engineer (L4-L5) |
| Senior ML/AI Engineer | Senior ML Engineer (IC5-IC6) | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer (L5-L6) | Senior ML Engineer (L5-L6) |

- **Coinbase ML Engineer (IC4-IC6):** $330K-$480K TC — Kraken should match and apply pre-IPO options premium plus AI scarcity premium
- **Gemini ML Engineer:** $275K-$380K TC — Kraken's IPO trajectory and AI premium justify a 20-30% premium over Gemini
- **Block ML Engineer (L4-L6):** $320K-$460K TC — comparable base; Kraken pre-IPO equity and AI premium provide the margin
- **Robinhood ML Engineer (L4-L6):** $340K-$500K TC — strong competing benchmark; use as direct negotiation leverage
- **Pure-play AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Scale AI):** $400K-$700K+ TC — the ultimate competing benchmark; pre-IPO crypto equity must offset the AI company premium

#### IPO Window — The 20% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation

Kraken filed for its IPO in Q1/Q2 2026 with a Citadel-backed $20B valuation. ML/AI engineers are uniquely positioned during the IPO window because AI-powered capabilities are the fastest-growing value driver in exchange platform differentiation. Institutional investors increasingly evaluate crypto exchanges on the sophistication of their fraud detection, risk management, and compliance AI — all of which are built by ML engineers.

**Why 20% matters for ML/AI Engineers:**
- A standard ML/AI grant of $510K/4yr in options could appreciate to $867K-$1.275M+ at a post-IPO $30B-$40B market cap
- AI-powered fraud detection and compliance monitoring are regulatory requirements that will be highlighted in the S-1 as evidence of platform maturity
- ML/AI engineers face the strongest competing offers in the industry — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and hedge funds all compete for identical talent at $500K-$700K+ TC
- Post-IPO ML/AI hires will receive RSUs at market price; 20% more shares now captures the full pre-listing discount
- ML engineers at Coinbase who joined pre-IPO saw 4-8x option appreciation, with AI-focused roles commanding the highest refresher grants post-listing
- The opportunity cost of choosing Kraken over a pure-play AI company is significant — the 20% additional shares must offset this career opportunity cost

**Negotiation script:**
> "As an ML/AI engineer, I'll be building the intelligent systems that differentiate Kraken from every other exchange — real-time fraud detection, market manipulation surveillance, and AI-driven risk management that institutional investors specifically evaluate. I'm forgoing offers from pure-play AI companies at significantly higher liquid compensation to join Kraken during the pre-IPO window. Given this opportunity cost, the extreme scarcity of ML engineers with crypto domain expertise, and the illiquidity risk of pre-IPO options, I'm requesting a 20% increase in my options grant. This is the minimum premium required to make Kraken's pre-IPO equity competitive with the AI talent market."

#### Global Levers

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Lever:** "I'm joining during the pre-IPO window when AI-powered capabilities have maximum impact on how institutional investors evaluate Kraken's platform sophistication. The fraud detection, risk scoring, and compliance ML systems I build will be directly cited in the S-1 as competitive differentiators. I'm asking for 20% more options to align my compensation with both the strategic importance of AI and the illiquidity risk I'm absorbing."

2. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have competing offers from [Coinbase/Robinhood] at $470K TC with liquid RSUs and from [OpenAI/Anthropic/Scale AI] at $600K+ TC. ML/AI engineers with financial domain expertise can command $500K-$700K+ at pure-play AI companies. To accept Kraken's pre-IPO options, I need the grant increased to $600K/4yr and a signing bonus of $50K-$75K. The AI talent market has fundamentally repriced since 2023 and Kraken's offers must reflect this reality."

3. **AI Scarcity Premium Lever:** "The intersection of deep ML engineering expertise and crypto/financial domain knowledge is vanishingly rare — fewer than 500 engineers globally have built production ML systems for crypto exchanges. This scarcity is the reason for the +15-25% AI Premium on my total comp. Every major tech company, hedge fund, and AI lab is competing for this same talent, and my compensation should reflect the market clearing price."

4. **AI Regulatory Moat Lever:** "AI-powered compliance monitoring, fraud detection, and market surveillance are becoming regulatory requirements for crypto exchanges globally. The ML systems I build aren't just features — they're the regulatory moat that allows Kraken to operate in multiple jurisdictions as a public company. This makes AI engineering an existential investment, not a discretionary one. I'd like this reflected in a $25K base premium and 20% more options."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $265K+ base in SF with $580K+ in options/4yr. If Kraken opens at $228K base and $400K options, counter at $270K base and $620K options citing competing offers from Coinbase at $475K TC with liquid RSUs and from a pure-play AI company at $600K+ TC. Push for a $65K signing bonus, a $25K annual AI research stipend, and double-trigger IPO acceleration on 25% of shares. Walk-away floor: Accept at $248K+ base and $520K+ options/4yr. Below this, the opportunity cost of choosing Kraken over a pure-play AI company or a public crypto exchange with liquid RSUs is not adequately compensated by the pre-IPO equity upside.
