#### Negotiation DNA

The Solutions Architect at Kraken bridges technical architecture with client-facing strategy, designing integration solutions for institutional clients, exchange partners, and API consumers. Solutions architects at Kraken own the technical design of onboarding flows for institutional trading desks, custody integration architectures, and API platform strategies that enable third-party developers to build on Kraken's infrastructure. With Kraken's Q1/Q2 2026 IPO filing at a $20B Citadel-backed valuation, solutions architects are IPO-critical because institutional client acquisition and platform extensibility are key revenue growth narratives for public-market investors. The role requires a rare combination of deep technical knowledge (distributed systems, API design, security architecture) and client-facing communication skills — architects who can both design scalable systems and articulate their value to institutional clients command a significant market premium. The pre-IPO equity window makes this an ideal moment to negotiate aggressively on options, as the institutional integrations these architects design will directly drive the revenue growth metrics in Kraken's S-1.

#### Level Mapping

| Kraken Level | Coinbase Equivalent | Gemini Equivalent | Block (Square) Equivalent | Robinhood Equivalent |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect (IC5) | Technical Solutions Lead | Solutions Architect (L5) | Platform Architect (L5) |
| Senior Solutions Architect | Senior Solutions Architect (IC6) | Senior Technical Solutions | Senior Solutions Architect (L6) | Senior Platform Architect (L6) |

- **Coinbase Solutions Architect (IC5-IC6):** $255K-$370K TC — Kraken should match and add pre-IPO options premium
- **Gemini Technical Solutions Lead:** $220K-$300K TC — Kraken's IPO trajectory justifies a 15-20% premium over Gemini
- **Block Solutions Architect (L5-L6):** $245K-$350K TC — comparable base; Kraken pre-IPO equity is the differentiator
- **Robinhood Platform Architect (L5-L6):** $260K-$380K TC — strong competing benchmark; use for direct negotiation leverage

#### IPO Window — The 20% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation

Kraken filed for its IPO in Q1/Q2 2026 with a Citadel-backed $20B valuation. Solutions architects play a uniquely important role in the IPO narrative because they drive the institutional client pipeline — and institutional trading volume is one of the highest-signal metrics for exchange valuations in public markets. Every major institutional integration a solutions architect designs translates directly into revenue growth.

**Why 20% matters for Solutions Architects:**
- A standard SA grant of $330K/4yr in options could appreciate to $561K-$825K+ at a post-IPO $30B-$40B market cap
- Institutional client integrations designed during the IPO runway will be cited as revenue growth drivers in the S-1
- Post-IPO SA hires will receive RSUs at market price; 20% more shares now captures the full pre-listing discount
- Solutions architects at Coinbase who joined pre-IPO saw 3-6x option appreciation from 409A to post-listing values
- Kraken's push into institutional custody, prime brokerage, and API-first platform strategy makes SAs among the highest-impact hires

**Negotiation script:**
> "As a solutions architect, I'll be designing the institutional integrations and API platform strategy that directly drives Kraken's revenue growth narrative for public-market investors. Every institutional client I onboard increases trading volume and platform stickiness — metrics that are core to exchange valuations. Given this direct revenue impact and the illiquidity risk of pre-IPO options, I'm requesting a 20% increase in my options grant to reflect my contribution to the institutional growth story in the S-1."

#### Global Levers

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Lever:** "I'm joining during the pre-IPO window when institutional client acquisition has maximum impact on the IPO valuation narrative. The integrations I design will be highlighted as evidence of platform maturity and revenue diversification. I'm asking for 20% more options to align my compensation with the strategic timing of my contribution."

2. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have a competing offer from Coinbase at $360K TC with liquid RSUs and a $40K signing bonus. To accept Kraken's pre-IPO options with illiquidity risk, I need the grant increased to $400K/4yr and a signing bonus of $35K-$45K to make the transition financially rational."

3. **Institutional Revenue Lever:** "Solutions architects directly drive institutional revenue by designing and executing client integrations. Each institutional client I onboard represents $[X]M+ in annual trading volume. My compensation should reflect this direct revenue generation — I'd like a $20K base increase and 20% more options to match the revenue impact of this role."

4. **Technical-Client Hybrid Lever:** "The intersection of deep technical architecture skills and institutional client-facing ability is exceptionally rare. Engineers who can design distributed systems AND articulate their value to institutional trading desks command a premium because both skills are required simultaneously. I'd like my compensation to reflect this dual expertise with a 15% premium on both base and equity."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $215K+ base in SF with $380K+ in options/4yr. If Kraken opens at $185K base and $260K options, counter at $218K base and $400K options citing a competing Coinbase Solutions Architect offer at $365K TC with liquid equity. Push for a $38K signing bonus and quarterly revenue-tied performance bonuses. Walk-away floor: Accept at $205K+ base and $340K+ options/4yr. Below this, the dual technical-client role is undercompensated relative to pure-play architecture or pure-play client-facing roles at public companies.
