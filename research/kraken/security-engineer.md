### Security Engineer | Kraken Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO | $20B Valuation | Crypto Exchange | Options-Heavy | IPO-Critical | Security Track | +10-15% Security Premium

#### Compensation Benchmarks

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K-$235K | $250K-$430K | $25K-$42K | $275K-$388K |
| New York | $180K-$228K | $240K-$415K | $24K-$40K | $268K-$378K |
| Remote US | $168K-$212K | $220K-$385K | $20K-$36K | $232K-$328K |

*Note: +10-15% Security Premium applied to reflect the critical nature of securing a custodial crypto exchange holding billions in customer assets.*

#### Negotiation DNA

The Security Engineer at Kraken is responsible for protecting billions of dollars in customer crypto assets, securing the exchange platform against nation-state-level threats, and ensuring the company meets the regulatory security requirements demanded of a publicly traded financial institution. Security engineers at Kraken own cryptographic wallet security, smart contract auditing, penetration testing, threat modeling, incident response, and the security architecture of trading infrastructure that processes billions in daily volume. With Kraken's Q1/Q2 2026 IPO filing at a $20B Citadel-backed valuation, security engineers are among the most IPO-critical hires because a single security breach could destroy the entire IPO narrative — crypto exchange hacks have historically wiped billions in market value overnight. The pre-IPO equity window is particularly valuable for security engineers: their work is the foundation of institutional investor confidence, and the security posture they build will be directly scrutinized during the S-1 review and underwriter due diligence. The +10-15% Security Premium reflects the existential importance of this role in the crypto exchange domain.

#### Level Mapping

| Kraken Level | Coinbase Equivalent | Gemini Equivalent | Block (Square) Equivalent | Robinhood Equivalent |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Security Engineer | Security Engineer (IC4) | Security Engineer | Security Engineer (L4) | Security Engineer (L4) |
| Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Engineer (IC5) | Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Engineer (L5) | Senior Security Engineer (L5) |

- **Coinbase Security Engineer (IC4-IC5):** $270K-$395K TC — Kraken should match and apply pre-IPO options premium on top
- **Gemini Security Engineer:** $225K-$310K TC — Kraken's IPO trajectory and custodial risk justifies a 20-25% premium over Gemini
- **Block Security Engineer (L4-L5):** $258K-$365K TC — comparable base; Kraken's crypto custodial risk profile commands higher equity
- **Robinhood Security Engineer (L4-L5):** $275K-$400K TC — strong competing benchmark; use for direct negotiation leverage

#### IPO Window — The 20% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation

Kraken filed for its IPO in Q1/Q2 2026 with a Citadel-backed $20B valuation. Security engineers are existentially important during the IPO window. A major security breach at any point during the IPO runway — from filing through listing — could delay or derail the entire public offering. Underwriters and institutional investors will conduct deep security due diligence, and the security posture built by these engineers will be a core component of investor confidence.

**Why 20% matters for Security Engineers:**
- A standard security engineer grant of $340K/4yr in options could appreciate to $578K-$850K+ at a post-IPO $30B-$40B market cap
- A single security incident during the IPO runway could erase billions in valuation — security engineers are the insurance policy against catastrophic loss
- The S-1 filing will include detailed security disclosures; the infrastructure these engineers build directly shapes investor perception of risk
- Post-IPO security hires will receive RSUs at market price; 20% more shares now captures the full pre-listing discount
- Security engineers at Coinbase who joined pre-IPO saw 4-7x option appreciation, reflecting the premium the market places on exchange security
- Crypto security talent is among the scarcest in the industry — fewer than 2,000 engineers globally have deep crypto custody security experience

**Negotiation script:**
> "As a security engineer at a custodial crypto exchange, I'll be directly responsible for protecting billions in customer assets and ensuring the security posture that underwriters and institutional investors evaluate during IPO due diligence. A single breach could delay or destroy the IPO process entirely. Given this existential risk ownership and the illiquidity of pre-IPO options, I'm requesting a 20% increase in my options grant to reflect the fact that my work is the foundation of investor confidence in Kraken's security."

#### Global Levers

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Lever:** "I'm joining during the pre-IPO window when security posture is under maximum scrutiny from underwriters, regulators, and institutional investors. My work will be directly reviewed in the S-1 security disclosures and underwriter due diligence. I'm asking for 20% more options to reflect that security is not a cost center — it's the existential prerequisite for a $20B IPO."

2. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have a competing offer from Coinbase at $380K TC with liquid RSUs. Crypto security engineers are among the scarcest talent in the industry. To accept Kraken's pre-IPO options with illiquidity risk, I need the grant increased to $400K/4yr and a signing bonus of $35K-$50K. The market for crypto security talent is extremely tight and my skills are immediately deployable."

3. **Custodial Risk Lever:** "Kraken holds billions in customer crypto assets in custody. Security engineers at custodial exchanges bear a fundamentally different risk profile than those at non-custodial platforms — a breach doesn't just impact reputation, it results in direct financial loss of customer funds. This custodial responsibility commands a +10-15% premium over standard fintech security roles."

4. **Threat Landscape Lever:** "Crypto exchanges face nation-state-level attack sophistication — North Korean APT groups, sophisticated phishing campaigns, smart contract exploits, and social engineering attacks targeting employees. The threat model I'll be defending against is orders of magnitude more sophisticated than traditional fintech. This elevated threat landscape justifies premium compensation of $15K-$20K above standard security engineering roles."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $220K+ base in SF with $390K+ in options/4yr. If Kraken opens at $185K base and $265K options, counter at $225K base and $410K options citing a competing Coinbase Senior Security Engineer offer at $385K TC with liquid equity. Push for a $42K signing bonus and a $15K annual security on-call premium. Walk-away floor: Accept at $208K+ base and $350K+ options/4yr. Below this, the existential risk ownership of securing a custodial exchange during an IPO is not adequately compensated relative to public-company security roles with liquid RSUs and lower custodial risk.
