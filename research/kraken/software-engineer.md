#### Negotiation DNA

The Software Engineer role at Kraken sits at the foundation of a crypto exchange processing billions in daily trading volume. With Kraken's IPO filing in Q1/Q2 2026 backed by a $20B Citadel-supported valuation, this role carries outsized equity upside. Engineers at this level build and maintain core platform services, API integrations, and trading infrastructure. The pre-IPO window makes this an exceptional moment to negotiate aggressively on options grants, as post-listing liquidity will reprice these packages significantly upward. Kraken's engineering culture emphasizes remote-first autonomy, deep ownership of systems, and a bias toward shipping production-grade code in regulated financial environments.

#### Level Mapping

| Kraken Level | Coinbase Equivalent | Gemini Equivalent | Block (Square) Equivalent | Robinhood Equivalent |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Software Engineer (L3) | IC3 | SWE II | SWE L3 | L3 |
| Software Engineer (L4) | IC4 | Senior SWE | SWE L4 | L4 |

- **Coinbase IC3-IC4:** $200K-$310K TC — Kraken should match or exceed given pre-IPO upside
- **Gemini SWE II:** $185K-$270K TC — Kraken options premium justifies 15-20% above Gemini cash comp
- **Block SWE L3-L4:** $210K-$295K TC — comparable base, but Kraken pre-IPO equity is a distinct lever
- **Robinhood L3-L4:** $220K-$320K TC — use Robinhood offers as direct competing leverage

#### IPO Window — The 20% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation

Kraken filed for its IPO in Q1/Q2 2026 with a Citadel-backed $20B valuation. This creates a narrow and highly valuable negotiation window for incoming engineers. Pre-IPO option grants are priced at the current 409A valuation, which is typically 50-70% below the expected public listing price. Candidates should push for **20% more shares** than the initial offer before the public listing locks in higher strike prices.

**Why 20% matters:**
- At a $20B valuation, even a modest options grant of $200K/4yr could appreciate to $340K-$500K+ at a post-IPO $30B-$40B market cap
- Early employees at Coinbase saw 3-5x appreciation from pre-IPO grants to peak post-listing value
- Kraken's institutional backing from Citadel signals strong underwriter confidence, reducing downside risk on options
- The IPO lockup period (typically 180 days) means negotiating more shares now is the only way to capture maximum pre-listing upside

**Negotiation script:**
> "I'm excited about Kraken's trajectory toward the public markets. Given that we're in the pre-IPO window and my options will be priced at the current 409A valuation, I'd like to discuss increasing my grant by 20% to reflect the risk-adjusted value of joining before the listing. Engineers who join post-IPO will receive RSUs at market price — my willingness to join now should be reflected in a larger grant."

#### Global Levers

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Lever:** "I'm joining before the IPO, which means I'm taking on liquidity risk that post-IPO hires won't face. I'd like my options grant increased by 20% to reflect that I'm buying in at the ground floor of a $20B company heading to public markets."

2. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have a competing offer from Coinbase/Robinhood at $X total comp with liquid RSUs. To make the illiquid options at Kraken competitive, I'll need the grant size to be meaningfully larger — specifically 20-30% above the RSU equivalent at a public company."

3. **Crypto Domain Expertise Lever:** "My experience building systems for regulated financial platforms directly maps to Kraken's exchange infrastructure. Engineers with this background are scarce, and I'd like my compensation to reflect the premium the market places on crypto-native engineering talent."

4. **Signing Bonus Lever:** "Given the 1-year cliff on options vesting, I'd like a signing bonus of $25K-$40K to bridge the gap and offset the opportunity cost of leaving vested equity at my current employer."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $180K+ base in SF with $280K+ in options/4yr. If Kraken opens at $155K base and $200K options, counter at $178K base and $300K options citing a competing Coinbase IC4 offer at $295K TC with liquid equity. Push for a $30K signing bonus to bridge the cliff. Walk-away floor: Accept at $170K+ base and $250K+ options/4yr. Below this, the pre-IPO risk is not adequately compensated relative to public-company alternatives.
