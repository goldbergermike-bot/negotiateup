#### Negotiation DNA

The Data Scientist at Kraken transforms trading data, user behavior signals, and market intelligence into actionable insights that drive product decisions, risk management, and revenue optimization. Data scientists at Kraken work with uniquely rich datasets — billions of trade events, multi-chain blockchain data, real-time market microstructure signals, and institutional trading patterns. With Kraken's Q1/Q2 2026 IPO filing at a $20B Citadel-backed valuation, data scientists are IPO-critical because the metrics they surface and the models they build directly inform the growth narrative presented to public-market investors. Kraken's data challenges span fraud detection, market manipulation surveillance, dynamic pricing, and user segmentation — all of which require deep statistical expertise applied in a high-stakes financial environment.

#### Level Mapping

| Kraken Level | Coinbase Equivalent | Gemini Equivalent | Block (Square) Equivalent | Robinhood Equivalent |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Data Scientist | DS (L4) | Data Scientist | Data Scientist (L4) | DS (L4) |
| Senior Data Scientist | Senior DS (L5) | Senior DS | Senior DS (L5) | Senior DS (L5) |

- **Coinbase DS (L4-L5):** $225K-$330K TC — Kraken should match with pre-IPO options premium
- **Gemini DS:** $195K-$275K TC — Kraken's IPO trajectory justifies a 15-20% premium
- **Block DS (L4-L5):** $220K-$315K TC — comparable base; Kraken pre-IPO options add the margin
- **Robinhood DS (L4-L5):** $235K-$340K TC — strong competing benchmark; use for direct leverage

#### IPO Window — The 20% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation

Kraken filed for its IPO in Q1/Q2 2026 with a Citadel-backed $20B valuation. Data scientists play a uniquely important role in the IPO process because they own the metrics infrastructure and analytical models that define the growth story presented to investors. Every KPI in the S-1 — user growth, trading volume, revenue per user, retention — flows through data science.

**Why 20% matters for Data Scientists:**
- A standard data scientist grant of $270K/4yr in options could appreciate to $459K-$675K+ at a post-IPO $30B-$40B market cap
- Data scientists define the analytical framework that investors use to evaluate the company — their work literally shapes the IPO valuation narrative
- Post-IPO DS hires will receive RSUs at market price; 20% more shares now captures the full pre-listing discount
- Data scientists at Coinbase who joined pre-IPO saw 3-5x option appreciation
- Kraken's expansion into institutional analytics and market intelligence creates high-impact DS opportunities

**Negotiation script:**
> "Data scientists at Kraken own the metrics infrastructure that will be presented to public-market investors in the S-1 and during the roadshow. The models I build and the insights I surface will directly shape how investors evaluate Kraken's growth trajectory. Given this contribution and the illiquidity risk of pre-IPO options, I'm requesting a 20% increase in my options grant to reflect the strategic value of data science during the IPO window."

#### Global Levers

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Lever:** "I'm joining during the pre-IPO window when data-driven insights have maximum impact on company valuation. The metrics I build and the models I deploy will be directly cited in investor materials. I'm asking for 20% more options to align my compensation with this strategic timing."

2. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have a competing offer from Coinbase at $320K TC with liquid RSUs. To accept Kraken's pre-IPO options, I need the grant increased to $320K/4yr and a signing bonus of $25K-$35K to compensate for the liquidity difference."

3. **Crypto Data Expertise Lever:** "My experience with blockchain data analysis, market microstructure modeling, and crypto-specific fraud detection is directly applicable to Kraken's data challenges. Data scientists with this domain expertise command a 15-20% premium — the intersection of quantitative finance and crypto is an exceptionally thin talent pool."

4. **Metrics Infrastructure Lever:** "I'll be building the metrics and experimentation infrastructure that Kraken reports on as a public company. This is foundational work — every product decision and investor report will depend on the systems I build. This scope of impact justifies a premium in both base and equity."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $190K+ base in SF with $310K+ in options/4yr. If Kraken opens at $165K base and $210K options, counter at $192K base and $330K options citing a competing Coinbase DS offer at $315K TC with liquid equity. Push for a $28K signing bonus. Walk-away floor: Accept at $180K+ base and $275K+ options/4yr. Below this, the role is undercompensated given the scarcity of crypto-native data science talent.
