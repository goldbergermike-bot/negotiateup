#### Negotiation DNA

The DevOps Engineer at Kraken is responsible for the infrastructure reliability, deployment pipelines, and operational excellence of a crypto exchange that processes billions in daily trading volume across a 24/7/365 market. DevOps engineers at Kraken own CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration (Kubernetes), infrastructure-as-code (Terraform), observability stacks, and incident response automation. With Kraken's Q1/Q2 2026 IPO filing at a $20B Citadel-backed valuation, DevOps engineers are IPO-critical because platform uptime, deployment velocity, and infrastructure scalability are core metrics that institutional investors evaluate when assessing exchange reliability. Unlike traditional fintech, crypto exchanges never close — Kraken's DevOps team operates under continuous uptime requirements that exceed those of any traditional stock exchange. The pre-IPO equity window makes this an exceptional moment to negotiate aggressively on options grants, as the infrastructure reliability these engineers build directly underpins the company's public-market valuation narrative.

#### Level Mapping

| Kraken Level | Coinbase Equivalent | Gemini Equivalent | Block (Square) Equivalent | Robinhood Equivalent |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| DevOps Engineer | Infrastructure Engineer (IC4) | DevOps Engineer | Platform Engineer (L4) | Infrastructure Engineer (L4) |
| Senior DevOps Engineer | Senior Infra Engineer (IC5) | Senior DevOps | Senior Platform Engineer (L5) | Senior Infra Engineer (L5) |

- **Coinbase Infra Engineer (IC4-IC5):** $230K-$340K TC — Kraken should match with pre-IPO options premium on top
- **Gemini DevOps:** $195K-$270K TC — Kraken's IPO trajectory justifies a 15-20% premium over Gemini's equity
- **Block Platform Engineer (L4-L5):** $225K-$320K TC — comparable base; Kraken pre-IPO equity is the differentiator
- **Robinhood Infra Engineer (L4-L5):** $240K-$345K TC — strong competing benchmark; use for direct leverage

#### IPO Window — The 20% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation

Kraken filed for its IPO in Q1/Q2 2026 with a Citadel-backed $20B valuation. DevOps engineers are foundational to the IPO process because platform reliability and infrastructure scalability are among the first things institutional investors diligence. A single major outage during the IPO runway could materially impact valuation — DevOps engineers are the insurance policy against that scenario.

**Why 20% matters for DevOps Engineers:**
- A standard DevOps grant of $280K/4yr in options could appreciate to $476K-$700K+ at a post-IPO $30B-$40B market cap
- Platform uptime and incident response metrics will be cited in the S-1 as evidence of operational maturity — DevOps engineers own these numbers
- Post-IPO DevOps hires will receive RSUs at market price; 20% more shares now captures the full pre-listing discount
- Infrastructure engineers at Coinbase who joined pre-IPO saw 3-5x appreciation from 409A to peak post-listing value
- Kraken's 24/7/365 operational requirements create uniquely demanding on-call and reliability expectations that justify premium compensation

**Negotiation script:**
> "As a DevOps engineer, I'll be directly responsible for the platform uptime and deployment reliability that Kraken presents to public-market investors as evidence of operational maturity. A single major outage during the IPO window could impact valuation by hundreds of millions. Given this outsized risk ownership and the illiquidity of pre-IPO options, I'm requesting a 20% increase in my options grant to reflect my contribution to Kraken's infrastructure narrative in the S-1."

#### Global Levers

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Lever:** "I'm joining during the pre-IPO window when infrastructure reliability is the single most scrutinized metric by institutional investors. I'm the engineer ensuring zero-downtime deployments on a platform that never sleeps. I'm asking for 20% more options to align my compensation with the critical nature of my contribution during this window."

2. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have a competing offer from Coinbase at $325K TC with liquid RSUs and quarterly vesting. To accept Kraken's pre-IPO options with their inherent illiquidity and 1-year cliff, I need the grant increased to $340K/4yr and a signing bonus of $25K-$35K to bridge the liquidity gap."

3. **24/7 Operations Premium Lever:** "Crypto exchanges operate 24/7/365 — unlike traditional fintech, there are no market close windows for maintenance. The on-call burden and operational intensity for DevOps at Kraken significantly exceeds that of a traditional financial platform. This continuous uptime requirement commands a 10-15% premium over standard infrastructure roles."

4. **Infrastructure Tooling Lever:** "I'll be building the deployment pipelines, observability systems, and infrastructure-as-code that every engineering team at Kraken depends on. This is multiplicative infrastructure — every improvement I make accelerates the entire engineering organization. I'd like this leverage reflected in a $15K base increase and 20% more options."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $195K+ base in SF with $320K+ in options/4yr. If Kraken opens at $168K base and $215K options, counter at $198K base and $340K options citing a competing Coinbase Infrastructure IC5 offer at $330K TC with liquid equity. Push for a $28K signing bonus and on-call compensation of $15K/yr. Walk-away floor: Accept at $185K+ base and $280K+ options/4yr. Below this, the 24/7 operational burden and pre-IPO illiquidity risk are not adequately compensated relative to public-company infrastructure roles.
