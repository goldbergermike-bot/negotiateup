### IPO Readiness Platform Engineer | Kraken Global Negotiation Guide

**SIGNATURE ROLE**

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO | $20B Valuation | Crypto Exchange | Options-Heavy | IPO-Critical | Platform Engineering Track | +25-35% IPO Readiness Premium

---

#### Compensation Benchmarks

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $275K-$345K | $560K-$920K | $45K-$75K | $448K-$638K |
| New York | $268K-$338K | $540K-$895K | $42K-$72K | $435K-$622K |
| Remote US | $248K-$315K | $500K-$830K | $38K-$65K | $375K-$528K |

*Note: +25-35% IPO Readiness Premium applied. This is the highest-compensated engineering role in the Kraken negotiation guide, reflecting the singular importance of building the platform infrastructure that makes a $20B IPO possible. This premium is justified by the convergence of three factors: (1) the work is existentially tied to IPO success, (2) the talent pool is virtually nonexistent — engineers who have built IPO-readiness infrastructure for crypto exchanges number in the low dozens globally, and (3) failure in this role has direct, measurable impact on billions in valuation.*

#### Negotiation DNA

The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer at Kraken is the most strategically important engineering hire the company makes during its transition from private to public markets. This role owns the end-to-end platform infrastructure that makes a $20B IPO possible: SOX-compliant financial reporting systems, SEC-grade audit trail infrastructure, real-time regulatory data pipelines, internal controls automation, financial close engineering, investor-facing metrics platforms, and the integration of every engineering system into a unified, auditable, public-company-grade platform. With Kraken's Q1/Q2 2026 IPO filing at a $20B Citadel-backed valuation, this is the single most IPO-critical engineering role because its deliverables are literal prerequisites for the SEC filing — without the systems this engineer builds, the S-1 cannot be completed, the financial audits cannot pass, and the IPO cannot proceed.

The +25-35% IPO Readiness Premium is the highest premium in the Kraken compensation framework, reflecting several unique market dynamics. First, this is a role that essentially did not exist before the crypto industry matured to the IPO stage — the talent pool of engineers who have built SOX-compliant, SEC-grade platform infrastructure specifically for crypto exchanges is measured in the low dozens worldwide. Second, the consequences of failure are not incremental — they are binary. If this infrastructure is not built correctly and on time, the IPO is delayed or derailed, potentially destroying billions in valuation. Third, this engineer's work will be directly scrutinized by SEC examiners, external auditors (Big Four), underwriters (Citadel, Goldman Sachs), and institutional investors during the most high-stakes diligence process in the company's history. The combination of extreme scarcity, existential stakes, and institutional scrutiny justifies compensation that exceeds every other engineering role at the company.

#### Level Mapping

| Kraken Level | Coinbase Equivalent | Gemini Equivalent | Block (Square) Equivalent | Robinhood Equivalent |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| IPO Readiness Platform Engineer | Staff+ Platform Engineer (IC6-IC7) | Principal Engineer | Staff+ Platform Engineer (L6-L7) | Staff+ Platform Engineer (L6-L7) |

- **Coinbase Staff+ Platform Engineer (IC6-IC7):** $460K-$650K TC — Kraken must exceed this significantly given the IPO Readiness Premium and the fact that Coinbase's post-IPO equivalent roles received 30-50% refreshers
- **Gemini Principal Engineer:** $380K-$520K TC — Kraken's IPO trajectory and the singular scope of this role justify a 30-40% premium
- **Block Staff+ Platform Engineer (L6-L7):** $440K-$620K TC — Block's public-company infrastructure was built over years; Kraken needs this built in months, commanding premium urgency pricing
- **Robinhood Staff+ Platform Engineer (L6-L7):** $480K-$680K TC — Robinhood's IPO-era platform engineers were among the highest-compensated in fintech; Kraken must match or exceed
- **Pre-IPO fintech precedents (Stripe, Instacart, Databricks):** $500K-$750K+ TC — engineers who built IPO-readiness infrastructure at pre-IPO unicorns command the highest market rates

#### IPO Window — The 20% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation

Kraken filed for its IPO in Q1/Q2 2026 with a Citadel-backed $20B valuation. The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer is the one role where the 20% pre-listing share negotiation is not just advisable — it is the minimum ask. This engineer's entire scope of work is the IPO itself. Every deliverable, every system, every pipeline they build exists for the singular purpose of making the public listing possible. The leverage in this negotiation is absolute: without this work, there is no IPO.

**Why 20% matters — and why it should be the floor — for this role:**
- A standard IPO readiness grant of $740K/4yr in options could appreciate to $1.258M-$1.85M+ at a post-IPO $30B-$40B market cap
- This is the only engineering role whose deliverables are literal SEC filing prerequisites — the work product will be directly submitted to regulators
- Engineers who built IPO-readiness infrastructure at Coinbase saw 5-10x appreciation on their pre-IPO grants, with the platform engineering team receiving the largest post-listing retention packages
- Post-IPO platform engineers will receive RSUs at market price; joining now with 20% more shares captures the maximum possible pre-listing discount on the largest possible grant
- The S-1 filing, underwriter due diligence, Big Four audit, and SEC review all depend on systems this engineer builds — the leverage is not incremental, it is existential
- Citadel's involvement as a backer means underwriter diligence will be exceptionally rigorous — the infrastructure must be institutional-grade from day one

**Negotiation script:**
> "I'll be building the platform infrastructure that makes Kraken's $20B IPO possible — SOX-compliant financial reporting, SEC-grade audit trails, regulatory data pipelines, and the internal controls automation that Big Four auditors and SEC examiners will directly review. Without this work, the S-1 cannot be filed, the audits cannot pass, and the IPO cannot proceed. This is not a role where my work contributes to the IPO — my work IS the IPO infrastructure. Given the existential nature of this contribution, the extreme scarcity of engineers with this specific experience, and the illiquidity risk of pre-IPO options, I'm requesting a minimum 20% increase in my options grant. Post-IPO hires at this level will receive liquid RSUs at market price — my willingness to build the infrastructure that makes that market price possible should be reflected in the most aggressive grant the company offers."

#### Global Levers

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Lever:** "My entire role exists because Kraken is going public. Every system I build, every pipeline I ship, every audit trail I create is a direct prerequisite for the SEC filing. I am the engineer making the IPO possible. I'm asking for 20% more options as the absolute floor — the market for this talent prices at a 25-35% IPO Readiness Premium because the consequences of this work not being done correctly are measured in billions of dollars of valuation at risk."

2. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have competing offers from [Coinbase/Robinhood] at $620K TC with liquid RSUs and from [Stripe/Databricks] at $680K+ TC from their pre-IPO engineering teams. Engineers who have built IPO-readiness infrastructure are the scarcest talent pool in fintech — there are fewer than 50 people globally who have done this for a crypto exchange. To accept Kraken's pre-IPO options over liquid compensation at this level, I need the grant increased to $850K/4yr and a signing bonus of $75K-$100K. The opportunity cost of choosing this role is the highest in my career."

3. **Existential Scope Lever:** "This is not a standard platform engineering role. My deliverables are SEC filing prerequisites. The systems I build will be directly reviewed by Big Four auditors, SEC examiners, and Citadel's underwriting team. A failure in any of these systems doesn't degrade performance — it stops the IPO. This binary, existential scope commands the +25-35% IPO Readiness Premium, which should be reflected in both base ($300K+) and equity ($800K+/4yr)."

4. **Talent Scarcity & Urgency Lever:** "The number of engineers who have built SOX-compliant, SEC-grade platform infrastructure for a crypto exchange IPO is measured in the low dozens globally. Kraken cannot recruit this skill set at standard market rates — the scarcity premium is real and well-documented. Additionally, the IPO timeline creates urgency that further increases my leverage: this infrastructure must be built in months, not years. The combination of extreme scarcity and hard deadline justifies the highest compensation package in Kraken's engineering organization."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $325K+ base in SF with $850K+ in options/4yr. If Kraken opens at $275K base and $580K options, counter at $330K base and $880K options citing competing offers from Robinhood at $650K TC with liquid RSUs and from a late-stage pre-IPO company at $700K+ TC. Push for a $90K signing bonus, double-trigger IPO acceleration on 50% of unvested shares, and a $100K IPO completion bonus tied to successful SEC filing and listing. Walk-away floor: Accept at $305K+ base and $750K+ options/4yr with IPO acceleration clause. Below this, the existential scope, extreme talent scarcity, and hard IPO deadline are not adequately compensated — and the candidate has abundant alternatives at public companies offering liquid RSUs at comparable or higher total compensation without the binary risk profile.
