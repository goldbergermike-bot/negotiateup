#### Negotiation DNA

The Engineering Manager at Kraken leads teams building the core exchange platform, infrastructure, and financial systems that support billions in daily trading volume. This is a player-coach role that blends technical depth with people leadership — EMs at Kraken are expected to understand system architecture at a deep level while also driving team execution, hiring, and career development. With Kraken's Q1/Q2 2026 IPO filing at a $20B Citadel-backed valuation, engineering managers are IPO-critical because they own the delivery cadence and team health metrics that determine whether the platform is IPO-ready. Kraken's remote-first culture means EMs must excel at asynchronous leadership across time zones. The pre-IPO equity window makes this an exceptional moment for EMs to negotiate aggressively, as their impact on team velocity and platform stability directly translates to public-market valuation.

#### Level Mapping

| Kraken Level | Coinbase Equivalent | Gemini Equivalent | Block (Square) Equivalent | Robinhood Equivalent |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Engineering Manager | EM (M1) | Engineering Manager | EM (M1) | EM (M1) |
| Senior Engineering Manager | Senior EM (M2) | Senior EM | Senior EM (M2) | Senior EM (M2) |

- **Coinbase EM (M1):** $310K-$450K TC — Kraken should match on total comp and exceed on pre-IPO options
- **Gemini EM:** $270K-$380K TC — Kraken's IPO trajectory justifies a 15-20% premium
- **Block EM (M1):** $300K-$420K TC — similar base ranges; Kraken's pre-IPO equity is the differentiator
- **Robinhood EM (M1):** $320K-$460K TC — strong competing benchmark; use for direct negotiation leverage

#### IPO Window — The 20% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation

Kraken filed for its IPO in Q1/Q2 2026 with a Citadel-backed $20B valuation. Engineering managers play a pivotal role in the IPO process — they ensure teams are executing on the product and infrastructure roadmap that will be presented to public-market investors. Their leadership directly impacts the S-1 narrative around engineering velocity, platform reliability, and talent retention.

**Why 20% matters for Engineering Managers:**
- A standard EM grant of $400K/4yr in options could appreciate to $680K-$1M+ at a post-IPO $30B-$40B market cap
- Engineering managers control the delivery cadence of IPO-critical features — their leverage is uniquely high before the listing
- Post-IPO EM hires will receive RSUs at market price; negotiating 20% more shares now captures the entire pre-listing discount
- EMs who joined Coinbase pre-IPO saw 3-6x option appreciation from 409A to post-listing values
- Citadel's backing reduces IPO execution risk, making the 20% ask well-supported by market confidence

**Negotiation script:**
> "As an engineering manager, I'll be directly responsible for the team velocity and delivery cadence that determines Kraken's IPO readiness. My ability to hire, retain, and develop engineers through the IPO transition is a critical success factor. Given that I'm accepting pre-IPO options with illiquidity risk, I'm requesting a 20% increase in my grant size to reflect both this risk and the outsized impact my role has on the company's public-market trajectory."

#### Global Levers

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Lever:** "Engineering managers at pre-IPO companies bear dual risk: I'm taking on both the illiquidity of options and the leadership burden of delivering IPO-critical milestones. My grant should reflect both dimensions — I'm asking for a 20% increase to align my compensation with the strategic value of my role during this window."

2. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have a competing EM offer from Coinbase at $430K TC with liquid RSUs and a $45K signing bonus. To accept Kraken's pre-IPO options, I need the grant increased to $450K/4yr and a signing bonus of $40K-$50K. Public-company EM roles offer both liquidity and job security that pre-IPO positions inherently lack."

3. **Team Scale Lever:** "I'll be managing a team of [X] engineers building [critical system]. Engineering managers at this scope — managing $[Y]M+ in annual team cost — command compensation that reflects the scale of their organizational impact. At Coinbase and Robinhood, EMs managing teams of this size are compensated at $400K+ TC."

4. **Retention Through IPO Lever:** "I'd like a retention bonus of $50K-$75K tied to 18-month tenure, specifically designed to ensure leadership continuity through the IPO. Manager turnover during the pre-IPO and post-listing period is the highest-risk factor for engineering execution — this retention mechanism benefits both sides."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $240K+ base in SF with $440K+ in options/4yr. If Kraken opens at $210K base and $320K options, counter at $245K base and $460K options citing a competing Coinbase M1 offer at $435K TC with liquid equity. Push for a $45K signing bonus and an $60K retention bonus tied to 18-month IPO tenure. Walk-away floor: Accept at $230K+ base and $380K+ options/4yr. Below this, the management burden during the IPO transition is not adequately compensated.
