### DevOps Engineer | Weights & Biases Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity | MLOps Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Global ML Infrastructure Reliability

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$215K | $120K–$220K | 5–10% | $210K–$290K |
| New York | $160K–$210K | $120K–$220K | 5–10% | $205K–$283K |
| London | £125K–£163K | £90K–£165K | 5–10% | £158K–£220K |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at W&B ensure the platform reliably serves ML teams across every major AI company in the world. When OpenAI, NVIDIA, or Meta AI runs training jobs that log to W&B, the infrastructure must handle massive burst traffic, maintain sub-second dashboard refresh times, and never lose experiment data. W&B's multi-tenant architecture — serving thousands of organizations with different scale profiles, security requirements, and deployment preferences (cloud and on-prem) — creates a uniquely complex DevOps challenge.

W&B also offers dedicated cloud and on-premise deployment options for enterprise customers, meaning DevOps Engineers must manage multiple deployment targets, CI/CD pipelines for diverse environments, and infrastructure automation that works across AWS, GCP, Azure, and bare-metal GPU clusters. This multi-environment complexity is rare among developer tools companies, and DevOps Engineers with this experience command a premium.

**Level Mapping:** W&B DevOps Engineer = Google L4 SRE = Databricks DevOps Engineer = Datadog Infrastructure Engineer = Meta Production Engineer E4

### Global ML Infrastructure Reliability Lever
W&B's 2026 infrastructure challenge is scaling to support the explosion in LLM training: individual training runs can generate orders of magnitude more data than traditional ML experiments, and the number of organizations training LLMs is growing exponentially. DevOps Engineers must build auto-scaling infrastructure that handles these burst patterns, ensure data durability at petabyte scale, and maintain performance SLAs that enterprise customers require.

The GPU infrastructure dimension adds complexity: W&B's on-prem deployments often run alongside GPU training clusters, requiring DevOps expertise with NVIDIA infrastructure, InfiniBand networking, and GPU cluster monitoring. DevOps Engineers who understand both cloud-native infrastructure and GPU cluster operations bring a rare combination that W&B needs for its enterprise deployment expansion.

**Global Levers**
1. **Multi-Environment Deployment Expertise:** "I've managed infrastructure across cloud and on-prem GPU clusters at [company]. W&B's multi-deployment model needs this exact experience. I'm looking for $210K base and $210K equity/4yr."
2. **ML Infrastructure Reliability at Scale:** "I've maintained 99.99% uptime for data-intensive platforms serving thousands of enterprise customers. That reliability track record commands $215K base for W&B's mission-critical ML infrastructure."
3. **Competing Infrastructure Offers:** "Datadog is offering $210K / $240K RSU and Databricks is at $205K / $220K RSU. I need $210K base and $220K equity to choose W&B over liquid equity."
4. **Enterprise Deployment Acceleration:** "I can accelerate W&B's enterprise on-prem deployment velocity — I've built Kubernetes-based deployment pipelines for air-gapped environments at [company]. That skill directly enables enterprise revenue. I'd like a $25K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "W&B's infrastructure challenge — multi-environment ML platform reliability at massive scale — maps directly to my experience managing cloud and on-prem GPU infrastructure. I'm holding a Datadog offer at $210K / $240K RSU and a Databricks offer at $205K / $220K RSU. To choose W&B, I need $210K base, $215K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $210K, I commit to scaling W&B's infrastructure for the LLM era. My floor is $195K — below that, Datadog's liquid equity wins."
