### Senior Software Engineer | Weights & Biases Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Growth-Stage Equity | MLOps Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Full-Stack AI Platform Engineering

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $200K–$255K | $190K–$340K | 5–10% | $268K–$405K |
| New York | $195K–$250K | $190K–$340K | 5–10% | $263K–$398K |
| London | £152K–£194K | £143K–£255K | 5–10% | £203K–£305K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at W&B own major product areas: experiment tracking infrastructure, model registry systems, LLM evaluation frameworks, production monitoring dashboards, or the core SDK that ML teams integrate into their workflows. W&B expects senior engineers to drive technical decisions independently, mentor the team, and ship features that delight ML practitioners. The role demands both backend systems depth (handling petabytes of experiment data) and frontend craft (building the dashboards and visualizations that make W&B beloved).

W&B's position as the most widely-adopted ML experiment tracking platform means Senior SWEs shape how the entire AI industry manages its ML lifecycle. Competing offers from Databricks, Comet ML, Neptune.ai, and major AI labs like Google DeepMind and OpenAI provide strong negotiation benchmarks. Your experience shipping production ML tools or developer platforms is direct leverage.

**Level Mapping:** W&B Senior SWE = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Databricks Senior SWE = Datadog Senior SWE = Snowflake Senior SWE

### Full-Stack AI Platform Engineering Lever
W&B's 2026 full-stack platform strategy means Senior SWEs will build across experiment tracking, model management, LLM evaluation (W&B Weave), AI agent tracing, and production monitoring — creating an integrated AI development platform rather than point solutions. Senior engineers who can architect features that span multiple product surfaces while maintaining consistency and performance are essential to this unified platform vision.

The technical complexity is significant: W&B processes billions of experiment log entries, serves real-time training dashboards to thousands of concurrent users, and must integrate seamlessly with every major ML framework (PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, Hugging Face). Senior engineers with experience at this scale — and with this diversity of integration points — are rare and command a premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Platform Scale Experience:** "I've built systems handling billions of events at [company] — the exact scale W&B's experiment tracking operates at. That distributed systems experience commands $250K base and $320K equity/4yr."
2. **ML Framework Integration Depth:** "I have deep expertise with PyTorch, JAX, and the ML ecosystem that W&B integrates with. Engineers who understand both the ML frameworks and the infrastructure beneath them are rare. I need $248K base."
3. **Competing Senior Offers:** "Databricks is offering Senior SWE at $252K / $360K RSU and Google is at L5 with $245K / $350K RSU — both liquid. W&B's mission excites me, but I need $250K base and $330K equity/4yr to offset the liquidity risk."
4. **Developer Community Impact:** "W&B has the most passionate developer community in MLOps. My work will directly impact hundreds of thousands of ML practitioners. That community leverage justifies $255K base and a $35K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've been a W&B power user for years, and the opportunity to build the platform I rely on daily is compelling. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $252K / $360K RSU and a Google L5 offer at $245K / $350K RSU — both liquid. To choose W&B, I need $250K base, $325K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $35K signing bonus. At $250K base, I sign and dedicate myself to making W&B the default AI development platform. My floor is $230K — below that, public-company liquidity wins."
