**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at W&B are the technical bridge between the platform and enterprise ML teams — designing deployment architectures, building proof-of-concept integrations, configuring custom W&B environments, and demonstrating how the platform accelerates ML development at enterprise scale. This role requires a rare combination of ML practitioner knowledge, infrastructure expertise, and customer-facing communication. You must be equally comfortable discussing training hyperparameters with an ML researcher and presenting ROI analyses to a VP of Engineering.

The SA role is directly tied to W&B's enterprise revenue — every enterprise deal you support adds to ARR. W&B's enterprise motion is accelerating as more organizations formalize their ML operations, and SAs who can demonstrate the value of unified ML experiment tracking, model management, and LLM evaluation to enterprise decision-makers are essential to revenue growth.

**Level Mapping:** W&B Solutions Architect = Databricks Solutions Architect = Snowflake Solutions Architect = Google Cloud Customer Engineer = AWS Solutions Architect

### Enterprise ML Platform Adoption Lever
W&B's 2026 enterprise strategy depends on SAs who can demonstrate the full AI development lifecycle value proposition — from experiment tracking through LLM evaluation to production monitoring — to enterprise CDOs, VP Engineering, and ML leadership. SAs who can articulate how W&B replaces fragmented internal ML tooling with a unified platform, quantify the productivity gains, and architect deployment plans that satisfy enterprise security requirements will close larger deals faster.

The LLM adoption wave creates a new SA opportunity: many enterprises are building LLM-powered products for the first time and need guidance on evaluation, monitoring, and MLOps best practices. SAs who can serve as trusted ML advisors — not just product demonstrators — build deeper relationships and drive larger, stickier enterprise deals.

**Global Levers**
1. **ML Domain SA Premium:** "I'm an ML practitioner who can sell — I've trained models, built ML pipelines, and presented technical solutions to enterprise leadership. That dual expertise commands $210K base plus 25% variable."
2. **Enterprise ML Revenue Attribution:** "I directly influence enterprise deal closures worth $300K–$1.5M ARR each. My technical demos and architecture designs convert ML teams to W&B customers. That revenue impact justifies $215K base."
3. **Competing SA Offers:** "Databricks is offering SA at $215K / 20% variable / $210K RSU. I need $210K base and 25% variable to choose W&B."
4. **Enterprise ML Advisory Premium:** "I don't just demo the product — I advise enterprise ML teams on best practices, evaluation frameworks, and MLOps architecture. That advisory relationship drives larger, stickier deals. I'd like a $25K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've sold complex ML platform solutions to enterprise teams and I deeply understand ML workflows from the practitioner side. I'm holding a Databricks SA offer at $215K / 20% variable / $210K RSU and an AWS SA offer at $200K / 20% variable / $200K RSU. To choose W&B, I need $210K base, 25% variable, $205K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $210K, I commit and bring my enterprise ML network. My floor is $195K — below that, Databricks' liquid equity and established enterprise motion is the safer choice."
