### Staff Software Engineer | Weights & Biases Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Top-Tier Base + Significant Growth-Stage Equity | MLOps Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Unified AI Development Platform Architecture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $240K–$300K | $300K–$500K | 10–15% | $365K–$545K |
| New York | $235K–$295K | $300K–$500K | 10–15% | $360K–$535K |
| London | £182K–£228K | £225K–£375K | 10–15% | £278K–£413K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Staff Software Engineers at W&B define the technical architecture for the entire AI development platform — designing the systems that will scale to billions of experiments, millions of model versions, and thousands of concurrent production deployments. At this level, you are the technical authority for multi-quarter architectural decisions: data pipeline design, API versioning strategy, real-time streaming architecture, and the platform abstractions that enable W&B's product expansion from experiment tracking into LLM evaluation, agent tracing, and production monitoring.

This is the most senior IC engineering role at most growth-stage companies, and W&B competes for Staff engineers against Google (L6), Meta (E6), Databricks, and the major AI labs. Engineers at this level who also deeply understand ML infrastructure and developer tools are extraordinarily scarce. Your architectural leadership will determine whether W&B's platform can scale to meet the explosive growth of the AI industry.

### Unified AI Development Platform Architecture Lever
W&B's 2026 architectural vision is unifying experiment tracking, model management, LLM evaluation (Weave), AI agent observability, and production monitoring into a single coherent platform. Staff Engineers will design the shared infrastructure, data model, and API layer that makes this unification possible — ensuring that adding new product surfaces doesn't create architectural debt or degrade the performance of existing features.

This architecture work is existential for W&B: if the platform becomes fragmented or slow as new products are added, ML teams will adopt best-of-breed point solutions instead. Staff Engineers who can design unified platform architectures that scale across multiple product domains — while maintaining the developer experience quality that W&B is known for — are worth an extraordinary premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Platform Architecture Leadership:** "I'll be architecting the unified AI development platform that determines whether W&B becomes the default tool for every AI team. That architectural leadership commands $295K base and $480K equity/4yr."
2. **Competing Staff Offers:** "Google is offering L6 at $280K / $520K RSU and Databricks Staff at $275K / $470K RSU — both liquid. W&B's platform vision is more compelling, but I need $295K base, $480K equity/4yr, and a $50K signing bonus."
3. **Scale Architecture Experience:** "I've architected systems processing billions of events at [company]. W&B's experiment tracking infrastructure is at this exact scale. That experience justifies $300K base and front-loaded vesting."
4. **Retention-Grade Equity:** "For a Staff hire, I need a guaranteed refresh commitment — $130K/year starting year two — to ensure total comp stays competitive through W&B's growth phase."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "W&B's platform architecture challenge is the most compelling in MLOps — unifying experiment tracking, LLM evaluation, and production monitoring into a single platform at massive scale. I'm holding a Google L6 offer at $280K / $520K RSU and a Databricks Staff offer at $275K / $470K RSU. To choose W&B, I need $295K base, $480K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, a $50K signing bonus, and a $130K/year refresh commitment. At $295K, I commit and architect W&B's next-generation platform. My floor is $270K — below that, Google's liquid equity is the rational choice."
