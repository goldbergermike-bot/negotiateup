### Engineering Manager | Weights & Biases Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Significant Growth-Stage Equity | MLOps Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Scaling AI Platform Engineering Teams

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $215K–$270K | $210K–$380K | 10–15% | $295K–$440K |
| New York | $210K–$265K | $210K–$380K | 10–15% | $290K–$430K |
| London | £163K–£205K | £158K–£285K | 10–15% | £225K–£335K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at W&B lead the teams building the AI development platform — managing 6-12 engineers across experiment tracking, model registry, Weave (LLM evaluation), production monitoring, or core platform infrastructure. W&B's EM role is deeply technical: you're expected to understand ML systems, API design, and distributed systems architecture well enough to make informed trade-offs and participate in design reviews. This is a technical leadership position that also requires exceptional people management, particularly in hiring and retaining top ML-adjacent engineering talent.

At a growth-stage company like W&B, EMs are building the engineering organization for the next era of AI tooling. You're hiring the engineers who will build W&B's platform for the next five years, establishing the engineering culture, and creating the processes that enable shipping velocity without sacrificing quality. Companies like Databricks, Datadog, Figma, and the major AI labs compete for EMs with this technical depth and organizational capability.

### Scaling AI Platform Engineering Teams Lever
W&B's 2026 growth requires rapidly scaling engineering across multiple product surfaces — experiment tracking, LLM evaluation, agent observability, and production monitoring — while maintaining the cohesive product experience that users love. EMs must hire engineers who deeply understand ML workflows, create team structures that enable parallel product development, and foster a culture where developer experience obsession drives every decision.

The organizational challenge is particularly acute: W&B is expanding from a focused experiment tracking tool to a multi-product AI development platform. EMs who have managed this kind of product expansion — building new teams for new product areas while keeping existing teams productive — bring directly applicable experience. The ability to attract and retain ML infrastructure engineers in the most competitive hiring market in tech is the core capability W&B needs from its EMs.

**Global Levers**
1. **Org-Building for AI Platform Scale:** "I've built engineering organizations that scaled from 15 to 60+ engineers during rapid product expansion at [company]. That org-building experience commands $265K base and $360K equity/4yr."
2. **ML Engineering Talent Network:** "I can bring a network of exceptional ML infrastructure engineers to W&B — I've managed and mentored top talent at [company]. That hiring multiplier justifies $270K base and a $40K signing bonus."
3. **Competing EM Offers:** "Databricks is offering EM at $260K / $400K RSU and Datadog is at $255K / $360K RSU — both liquid. I need $265K base and $370K equity/4yr to choose W&B."
4. **Multi-Product Team Architecture:** "I've managed the transition from single-product to multi-product engineering at [company]. W&B needs exactly this experience as it expands beyond experiment tracking. I'm looking for $268K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "W&B's growth from experiment tracking to a unified AI development platform is the most exciting engineering leadership opportunity in MLOps. I'm holding a Databricks EM offer at $260K / $400K RSU and a Datadog EM offer at $255K / $360K RSU. To choose W&B, I need $265K base, $365K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $40K signing bonus. At $265K, I start building the engineering org for W&B's next chapter. My floor is $245K — below that, Databricks' liquid equity is the rational choice."
