**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at W&B protect the ML experiment data, model artifacts, and training configurations for thousands of AI teams — including some of the most sensitive AI research in the world. When OpenAI, NVIDIA, and government AI labs log experiments to W&B, they're trusting the platform with trade secrets worth billions of dollars. A security breach at W&B wouldn't just expose data — it could expose the model architectures, training recipes, and proprietary techniques that give AI companies their competitive advantage. This makes Security Engineering at W&B among the most high-stakes security roles in tech.

The enterprise security mandate is particularly demanding: W&B offers cloud, dedicated cloud, and on-premise deployments, each with different security requirements. Security Engineers must build and maintain security across all deployment models while achieving SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, and FedRAMP compliance for increasingly regulated AI workloads. This multi-deployment security challenge is rare and complex.

### Enterprise ML Security & Model Supply Chain Protection Lever
W&B's 2026 security mandate includes a new dimension: model supply chain security. As organizations use W&B's model registry to manage, version, and deploy models, the security of the model artifact pipeline becomes critical. Poisoned models, tampered weights, or unauthorized access to model artifacts could have catastrophic downstream consequences. Security Engineers who understand ML model security — model provenance, artifact integrity verification, and model supply chain attacks — are on the cutting edge of a nascent field.

Additionally, the expansion into LLM evaluation (Weave) and AI agent tracing introduces new data security challenges: evaluation datasets may contain sensitive prompts, agent traces may reveal proprietary workflows, and LLM outputs may inadvertently contain PII. Security Engineers who can build security frameworks for these AI-specific data types are extremely rare and valuable.

**Global Levers**
1. **ML Data Security Premium:** "Protecting ML experiment data and model artifacts for the world's leading AI teams is among the highest-stakes security work in tech. That responsibility commands $225K base and $240K equity/4yr."
2. **Model Supply Chain Security Specialization:** "Model supply chain security is a nascent field and I'm one of the few security engineers with expertise. I've built model provenance and artifact integrity systems at [company]. That unique expertise justifies $230K base."
3. **Competing Security Offers:** "CrowdStrike is offering $220K / $260K RSU and Databricks is at $225K / $250K RSU. I need $225K base and $245K equity to choose W&B over liquid equity."
4. **Enterprise Compliance Acceleration:** "I've led SOC 2 Type II and FedRAMP compliance programs. Accelerating W&B's enterprise compliance by 6+ months directly enables government and healthcare AI contracts worth millions. I'd like a $30K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "W&B's security challenge — protecting the most sensitive AI research data in the world across cloud, dedicated, and on-prem deployments — is the most compelling security engineering role in MLOps. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $225K / $250K RSU and a CrowdStrike offer at $220K / $260K RSU. To choose W&B, I need $225K base, $245K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $225K, I commit to building the security program that enables W&B's enterprise AI expansion. My floor is $210K — below that, the liquid equity elsewhere wins."
