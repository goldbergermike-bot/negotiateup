**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Weights & Biases (W&B) build the MLOps platform that the world's leading AI teams depend on to track experiments, manage models, and deploy AI at scale. W&B's customers include OpenAI, NVIDIA, Meta AI, and thousands of ML teams — making this a uniquely high-leverage engineering role where your code directly impacts how AI gets built globally. The engineering culture values developer experience obsession, rapid iteration, and deep empathy for ML practitioners' workflows.

W&B competes for engineering talent against Databricks, MLflow-adjacent companies, Neptune.ai, and the major AI labs themselves. Engineers who understand both traditional software engineering and ML workflow tooling are in high demand. Your experience with developer tools, API design, or ML infrastructure translates directly to W&B's core product, and competing offers from these companies establish your negotiation floor.

### AI Developer Experience Expansion Lever
W&B's 2026 strategy focuses on expanding from experiment tracking into a comprehensive AI developer experience platform — adding LLM evaluation tools, prompt engineering workflows, AI agent observability, and production model monitoring. Software Engineers who can build elegant developer-facing tools for these emerging AI workflows are critical to this expansion. If you have experience building developer tools, CLI frameworks, SDK libraries, or observability systems, you bring directly applicable skills.

The competitive landscape is intensifying: Databricks (with MLflow), LangSmith, and a wave of AI observability startups are all competing for the same AI developer experience market. W&B needs to ship new features faster while maintaining the developer experience quality that earned its loyal community. Engineers who can build great developer tools at high velocity are worth a premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **ML Tooling Domain Expertise:** "I understand ML workflows from the practitioner side — I've trained models, debugged experiments, and built ML pipelines. That domain expertise makes me a more effective W&B engineer. I'm looking for $210K base and $230K equity/4yr."
2. **Developer Tools Shipping Speed:** "I've shipped developer-facing APIs and SDKs at [company] with high adoption. W&B's developer experience is its moat — I can ship features that ML engineers actually love. I need $210K base."
3. **Competing Offers from ML Platform Companies:** "Databricks is offering $205K base / $260K RSU for a similar ML platform role. I need $210K base and $235K equity/4yr to choose W&B over liquid public-company equity."
4. **AI Observability Market Growth:** "W&B's expansion into AI observability and LLM evaluation puts it at the center of the fastest-growing segment in developer tools. I want to be meaningfully invested: $240K equity/4yr with early vesting."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "W&B is the MLOps platform I've used and loved as an ML practitioner — and now I want to build it. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $205K / $260K RSU and a Datadog offer at $200K / $220K RSU, both liquid. To choose W&B, I need $210K base, $230K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $210K base, I'm committed. My floor is $195K — below that, the liquid equity at Databricks wins."
