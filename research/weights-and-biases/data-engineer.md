### Data Engineer | Weights & Biases Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity | MLOps Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: ML Data Pipeline Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$210K | $120K–$220K | 5–10% | $210K–$285K |
| New York | $160K–$205K | $120K–$220K | 5–10% | $205K–$278K |
| London | £125K–£160K | £90K–£165K | 5–10% | £158K–£215K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at W&B build and maintain the data infrastructure that processes, stores, and serves billions of ML experiment logs, model artifacts, and training metrics. W&B's data pipeline is one of the most demanding in the developer tools space — ingesting high-frequency, high-dimensional time-series data from ML training runs across thousands of organizations simultaneously. The role requires expertise in streaming data architectures, time-series databases, data lake design, and the ETL pipelines that transform raw experiment data into the visualizations and analytics that ML teams rely on.

W&B's data infrastructure directly impacts product quality: if experiment dashboards are slow, if data is lost, or if queries time out, ML teams will churn to competing platforms. Data Engineers here are core product engineers, not internal support. Companies like Databricks, Snowflake, Datadog, and Confluent compete for this profile, providing strong negotiation benchmarks.

**Level Mapping:** W&B Data Engineer = Google L4 Data Engineer = Databricks Data Engineer = Snowflake Data Engineer II = Datadog Data Engineer

### ML Data Pipeline Infrastructure Lever
W&B's 2026 data infrastructure challenges include scaling experiment data ingestion 10x to support the explosion in LLM training (where a single training run can generate terabytes of logs), building efficient storage and retrieval for model artifacts, and creating the data pipeline infrastructure for new product surfaces like LLM evaluation and production monitoring. Data Engineers with experience in high-throughput streaming systems and time-series data at scale are essential.

The ML-specific context matters: data from ML experiments is uniquely complex — high-dimensional tensors, variable-length training runs, heterogeneous metadata, and the need for both real-time streaming and historical batch access. Data Engineers who understand ML workflows and can design data systems optimized for ML experiment patterns command a premium over generic data engineers.

**Global Levers**
1. **ML Data Pipeline Specialization:** "ML experiment data is uniquely complex — high-dimensional, high-frequency, and requiring both streaming and batch access. I have deep experience with ML data pipelines at [company]. That specialization commands $205K base and $210K equity/4yr."
2. **Scale Infrastructure Experience:** "I've built data pipelines processing billions of events daily at [company]. W&B needs this exact scale experience as ML training data volumes explode. I need $210K base."
3. **Competing Data Platform Offers:** "Databricks is offering $205K / $250K RSU and Datadog is at $200K / $220K RSU for data engineering roles. I need $205K base and $220K equity to choose W&B."
4. **Product Quality Impact:** "W&B's experiment dashboards are only as good as the data infrastructure beneath them. My pipeline work directly impacts product quality and user retention. I'd like $205K base and a $20K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "W&B's data pipeline challenge — scaling ML experiment ingestion to handle the LLM training explosion — is exactly the infrastructure problem I've solved. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $205K / $250K RSU and a Datadog offer at $200K / $220K RSU. To choose W&B, I need $205K base, $215K equity/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $205K base, I commit. My floor is $190K — below that, Databricks' liquid equity is the rational choice."
