### MLOps Platform Engineer | Weights & Biases Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Growth-Stage Equity + AI Premium | MLOps Platform Leader | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | 2026 Focus: Next-Gen ML Lifecycle Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $210K–$270K | $220K–$380K | 10–15% | $295K–$440K |
| New York | $205K–$265K | $220K–$380K | 10–15% | $290K–$430K |
| London | £160K–£205K | £165K–£285K | 10–15% | £225K–£335K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The MLOps Platform Engineer is Weights & Biases' signature role — the position that defines the company's core technical identity. You build the foundational platform infrastructure that powers the entire W&B product suite: the experiment tracking ingestion pipeline, the model artifact storage and versioning system, the real-time training dashboard streaming engine, the SDK integration layer, and the distributed query engine that makes billions of logged data points queryable in real time. This is not application-layer feature engineering — it's building the platform that all other features run on. Every product improvement at W&B depends on the platform architecture you design.

The MLOps Platform Engineer requires an extraordinarily rare skill combination: distributed systems expertise (handling billions of events at sub-second latency), ML domain knowledge (understanding what ML teams actually need from infrastructure), developer tools sensibility (building APIs and SDKs that ML engineers love), and platform architecture judgment (designing abstractions that enable rapid product expansion without technical debt). Engineers with this complete profile are in extreme demand from Databricks, Snowflake, Google ML Infrastructure, and every ML platform startup, giving you exceptional negotiation leverage.

**Level Mapping:** W&B MLOps Platform Engineer = Google L5-L6 Infrastructure Engineer = Meta E5-E6 Infrastructure = Databricks Staff Platform Engineer = Snowflake Principal Infrastructure Engineer

### Next-Gen ML Lifecycle Infrastructure Lever
W&B's 2026 platform architecture evolution centers on building unified infrastructure for the entire ML lifecycle — from experiment logging through model management, LLM evaluation, agent tracing, and production monitoring. The MLOps Platform Engineer will architect the shared data model, storage layer, query engine, and streaming pipeline that makes all W&B products feel like one cohesive platform rather than disparate point solutions. This is the technical foundation for W&B's transition from an experiment tracking tool to a comprehensive AI development platform.

The LLM era demands new platform capabilities: handling structured evaluation data alongside time-series training metrics, supporting agent execution trace storage and retrieval, enabling real-time production monitoring dashboards with alerting, and scaling the model artifact system to handle multi-gigabyte LLM checkpoints. MLOps Platform Engineers who can architect these next-generation capabilities — while maintaining backward compatibility with the experiment tracking infrastructure that millions of users depend on — are building the technical foundation for the entire MLOps industry.

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Scarcity Premium:** "Engineers who combine distributed systems expertise, ML domain knowledge, developer tools sensibility, and platform architecture judgment are vanishingly rare. This is W&B's defining technical role. I'm looking for $265K base and $370K equity/4yr."
2. **Unified Platform Architecture Impact:** "I'll be architecting the infrastructure that unifies W&B's entire product portfolio. My architectural decisions will determine whether W&B becomes the default AI development platform. That foundational impact commands $270K base and $380K equity/4yr."
3. **Competing Platform Engineer Offers:** "Google is offering L6 Infrastructure at $275K / $500K RSU and Databricks Staff Platform at $268K / $450K RSU — both liquid. W&B's mission is more compelling, but I need $270K base, $375K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $50K signing bonus."
4. **Platform = Product Moat:** "W&B's platform performance and reliability is the product moat — if dashboards are slow or data is lost, ML teams churn. My platform architecture work directly protects W&B's entire business. I'd like retention-grade equity: $380K/4yr with guaranteed $100K/year refreshes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Building the unified MLOps platform infrastructure for the company that powers the world's best AI teams — this is the most impactful platform engineering role in the ML ecosystem, and I'm the engineer who can build it. I'm holding a Google L6 Infrastructure offer at $275K / $500K RSU and a Databricks Staff Platform offer at $268K / $450K RSU — both liquid, both compelling. To choose W&B, I need $270K base, $375K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, a $50K signing bonus, and guaranteed $100K/year equity refreshes starting year two. The unified ML lifecycle platform is W&B's defining technical challenge, and my distributed systems and ML infrastructure experience maps directly to it. At $270K base, I sign immediately and dedicate the next chapter of my career to making W&B the infrastructure layer for all of AI. My floor is $250K — below that, Google's liquid equity and infrastructure resources make the financial trade-off irrational, no matter how compelling W&B's mission is."
