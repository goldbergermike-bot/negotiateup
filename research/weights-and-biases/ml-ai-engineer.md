### ML/AI Engineer | Weights & Biases Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Growth-Stage Equity + AI Premium | MLOps Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Intelligent ML Platform Features

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $195K–$255K | $170K–$310K | 5–15% | $268K–$395K |
| New York | $190K–$250K | $170K–$310K | 5–15% | $263K–$388K |
| London | £148K–£194K | £128K–£233K | 5–15% | £203K–£300K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at W&B build the machine learning systems that make the platform intelligent — automated experiment analysis, model quality prediction, hyperparameter optimization suggestions, LLM evaluation scoring, and the AI-powered features that transform W&B from a logging tool into an intelligent ML development assistant. This is a uniquely recursive role: you're building ML systems to help other ML teams build better ML systems. Your deep understanding of ML workflows, training dynamics, and model evaluation isn't just helpful — it's the core of the job.

The AI talent market in 2026 is the most competitive in W&B's hiring history. Every AI lab, cloud provider, and ML startup is competing for ML/AI engineers, and compensation has surged accordingly. W&B must pay an AI premium to attract engineers who could easily join OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic. Your ML expertise — especially in evaluation, experiment optimization, and MLOps — is your strongest negotiation asset.

**Level Mapping:** W&B ML/AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta ML Engineer IC4-5 = Databricks ML Engineer = OpenAI SWE = Anthropic SWE

### Intelligent ML Platform Features Lever
W&B's 2026 AI strategy centers on making the platform proactively intelligent: automatically detecting training anomalies, recommending experiment configurations, evaluating LLM output quality, tracing AI agent behavior, and providing data-driven insights that accelerate ML development cycles. ML/AI Engineers will build the models, evaluation pipelines, and intelligent features that make W&B indispensable to every AI team.

The LLM evaluation (Weave) initiative is particularly critical: as every company adopts LLMs, the need for systematic evaluation, comparison, and quality monitoring is exploding. ML/AI Engineers who can build robust LLM evaluation frameworks — handling diverse task types, subjective quality metrics, and production monitoring at scale — are building the infrastructure that the entire AI industry needs. This market-defining potential justifies a significant AI premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Talent Market Premium:** "The ML/AI engineer market is at peak competition. Anthropic is offering $230K base and OpenAI is at $240K for ML engineering roles. I need $250K base and $295K equity/4yr to choose a growth-stage MLOps company over established AI labs."
2. **LLM Evaluation Expertise:** "I've built LLM evaluation systems at [company] — the exact capability W&B is building with Weave. That direct experience commands $248K base and $300K equity."
3. **Meta-ML Systems Experience:** "I've built ML systems that improve ML workflows — recommendation engines for experiment configuration, automated anomaly detection for training runs. This recursive ML expertise is rare and directly applicable. I need $252K base."
4. **AI Lab Competing Offers:** "I'm weighing offers from Google DeepMind at $245K / $380K RSU and Anthropic at $235K / $320K equity. W&B's MLOps mission is compelling, but I need $250K base, $300K equity, and a $35K signing bonus to offset the liquidity risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Building intelligent features for the platform that powers the world's best AI teams — that's the most leveraged ML engineering role I can imagine. I'm holding offers from Google DeepMind at $245K / $380K RSU and Anthropic at $235K / $320K equity. To choose W&B, I need $250K base, $300K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. The AI premium in this market is real, and W&B's growth-stage equity needs to compensate for illiquidity. At $250K base, I commit. My floor is $230K — below that, the AI lab offers are stronger financially."
