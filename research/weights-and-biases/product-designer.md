### Product Designer | Weights & Biases Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity | MLOps Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: AI Developer Experience Design

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $155K–$200K | $110K–$200K | 5–10% | $198K–$268K |
| New York | $150K–$195K | $110K–$200K | 5–10% | $193K–$261K |
| London | £118K–£152K | £82K–£150K | 5–10% | £150K–£203K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at W&B create the visual and interaction design for one of the most data-dense, technically complex developer tools in the market. W&B dashboards display millions of data points from ML experiments — training curves, hyperparameter comparisons, model performance metrics — and designers must make this complexity navigable, beautiful, and actionable. The challenge is designing for ML practitioners who are deeply technical and have high expectations for both information density and visual clarity.

W&B's design reputation is a core competitive advantage — the dashboards are beloved by ML engineers precisely because they're well-designed. Designers here compete against roles at Figma, Linear, Vercel, and other design-forward developer tools companies. If you have experience designing data-dense interfaces, developer tools, or analytics dashboards, that domain expertise is significant leverage.

### AI Developer Experience Design Lever
W&B's 2026 product expansion into LLM evaluation (Weave), AI agent tracing, and intelligent experiment features creates entirely new design challenges. Product Designers must create interfaces for LLM evaluation comparisons, agent execution traces, prompt engineering workflows, and AI-powered insight panels — interaction patterns that barely existed two years ago. Designers who can invent these patterns will define how the entire AI industry experiences MLOps tools.

The AI feature design challenge is particularly acute: AI outputs are probabilistic, sometimes wrong, and require trust-building through transparency. Designers who understand how to present AI-generated insights, confidence levels, and evaluation results in ways that earn ML practitioners' trust bring a rare and valuable perspective.

**Global Levers**
1. **Data-Dense Design Specialization:** "Designing data-dense interfaces for technical users is a rare specialty. I've designed analytics dashboards at [company] that display millions of data points clearly. That expertise commands $195K base and $190K equity/4yr."
2. **Developer Tools Design Premium:** "Designer who understand developer workflows and can design for ML practitioners are extremely scarce. Figma is offering $190K / $220K RSU for developer tools design. I need $195K base."
3. **AI UX Innovation:** "Designing interfaces for LLM evaluation, agent tracing, and AI insights is uncharted territory. I bring AI interaction design experience from [company]. I need $200K base to reflect this emerging specialty."
4. **Design Craft = Product Moat:** "W&B's dashboard design is a core competitive advantage — it's why ML teams choose W&B over MLflow. My design work directly protects that moat. I'd like $195K base and a $20K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "W&B's design challenge — making ML complexity navigable and AI features trustworthy — is the most interesting design problem in developer tools. I'm holding a Figma offer at $190K / $220K RSU and a Vercel offer at $185K / $180K RSU. To choose W&B, I need $195K base, $190K equity/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $195K, I'm committed. My floor is $180K — below that, Figma's liquid equity and design culture is the safer choice."
