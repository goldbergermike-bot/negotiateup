### Data Scientist | Weights & Biases Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity | MLOps Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: ML Lifecycle Analytics & Evaluation Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $170K–$220K | $130K–$240K | 5–10% | $218K–$305K |
| New York | $165K–$215K | $130K–$240K | 5–10% | $213K–$298K |
| London | £129K–£167K | £98K–£180K | 5–10% | £165K–£230K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at W&B occupy a uniquely recursive role: you use ML and statistical methods to improve the platform that ML practitioners use to improve their own models. This includes building intelligent experiment recommendation systems, automated hyperparameter analysis tools, model quality scoring algorithms, and the analytics that help W&B understand how ML teams use the platform. You're a meta-ML practitioner — applying data science to make data science better.

Because W&B's users are ML practitioners, the Data Scientist role requires exceptional domain expertise. You must understand training dynamics, model evaluation metrics, experiment design patterns, and the full ML lifecycle deeply enough to build features that sophisticated ML engineers find genuinely useful. This domain-expert Data Scientist profile is much rarer than general-purpose data scientists, and companies like Databricks, Google Brain tooling, and ML infrastructure startups compete for the same talent.

**Level Mapping:** W&B Data Scientist = Google L4 Data Scientist = Meta IC4 Data Scientist = Databricks Data Scientist = Comet ML Data Scientist

### ML Lifecycle Analytics & Evaluation Intelligence Lever
W&B's 2026 push into LLM evaluation (Weave) and automated ML insights creates a massive opportunity for Data Scientists. You'll build evaluation frameworks that automatically assess LLM output quality, statistical methods for comparing model versions, anomaly detection for training runs, and intelligent dashboards that surface actionable insights from experiment data. These features transform W&B from a logging tool into an intelligent ML lifecycle analytics platform.

Data Scientists with experience in LLM evaluation, model quality metrics, or automated ML analysis bring directly applicable skills to W&B's highest-priority product initiatives. The LLM evaluation space is nascent — the evaluation frameworks and quality metrics are still being defined — and Data Scientists who can help establish industry standards through W&B's platform hold enormous influence and value.

**Global Levers**
1. **Meta-ML Domain Expertise:** "I'm a data scientist who deeply understands ML workflows — I've trained models, run experiments, and built evaluation pipelines. That practitioner expertise makes me uniquely effective at building ML analytics tools. I'm looking for $215K base and $230K equity/4yr."
2. **LLM Evaluation Specialization:** "LLM evaluation is the hottest problem in ML tooling, and I have direct experience building evaluation frameworks at [company]. That specialization commands $220K base for W&B's Weave product initiative."
3. **Competing ML Platform Offers:** "Databricks is offering $218K / $260K RSU for a similar ML analytics role. I need $215K base and $235K equity to choose W&B over liquid equity."
4. **Evaluation Standards Influence:** "W&B's evaluation tools will become the industry standard for LLM quality assessment. My work will influence how the entire AI industry evaluates models. That impact justifies $220K base and a $25K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "W&B's expansion into LLM evaluation and intelligent ML analytics is the most exciting data science application in developer tools. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $218K / $260K RSU and a Google L4 DS offer at $210K / $240K RSU. To choose W&B, I need $215K base, $230K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $215K, I commit to building the evaluation intelligence layer. My floor is $200K — below that, the liquid equity elsewhere is more rational."
