### Data Scientist | Activision Blizzard (Microsoft/Xbox) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus / Microsoft Comp Bands | Call of Duty Revenue Engine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine / Santa Monica | $160K–$220K | $90K–$220K | 10–15% | $218K–$335K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Activision Blizzard leverage player behavior data from 400M+ MAU to optimize matchmaking, predict churn, personalize content, and model monetization across the world's most popular gaming franchises. Post-acquisition, DS roles benefit from Microsoft's advanced analytics infrastructure and comp bands. The DS function at Activision/Blizzard has deep expertise in player psychology, engagement loop modeling, and A/B testing at massive scale. DS roles on the Call of Duty franchise have the most direct revenue attribution — every matchmaking improvement, content recommendation, and monetization model directly impacts billions in revenue. Blizzard DS roles on WoW and Diablo focus on long-term player retention and subscription optimization. [Source: Activision Analytics, Microsoft Gaming DS 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Activision/MS DS Level 62-63 = Google L4 DS = Meta IC4 DS

**Global Levers**

1. **400M+ MAU Data Scale:** "Activision's player dataset spans 400M+ monthly active players. The statistical power and behavioral richness of this data enables DS work that isn't possible at smaller-scale companies."
2. **Direct Revenue Attribution:** "My models will directly influence matchmaking (player satisfaction), content cadence (engagement), and monetization (revenue). Each percentage point improvement translates to tens of millions in revenue."
3. **Microsoft DS Comp Bands:** "Post-acquisition, I should be benchmarked against Microsoft DS bands. Level 62-63 DS in SoCal is $280K-$335K TC."
4. **Xbox Game Pass Analytics:** "Game Pass subscription analytics is a new DS frontier — understanding content consumption patterns, predicting churn, and optimizing the subscription funnel. My expertise in subscription analytics directly applies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $310K TC at Microsoft Level 63 with $200K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. My player behavior modeling expertise maps directly to Activision's highest-revenue analytics needs." Accept at $160K+ RSUs with 15% bonus.
