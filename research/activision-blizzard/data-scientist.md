Post-acquisition, DS roles benefit from Microsoft's advanced analytics infrastructure and comp bands. The DS function at Activision/Blizzard has deep expertise in player psychology, engagement loop modeling, and A/B testing at massive scale. DS roles on the Call of Duty franchise have the most direct revenue attribution — every matchmaking improvement, content recommendation, and monetization model directly impacts billions in revenue.
