**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Activision Blizzard now operate within Microsoft's compensation framework following the $69B acquisition. This is the most important thing to know: you are negotiating against Microsoft's comp bands, not legacy Activision bands. Microsoft's system uses levels 59-67+, and SWEs at Activision typically map to levels 59-62. The RSU component is now Microsoft stock (MSFT), one of the most stable large-cap equities in the world, making the equity component highly valuable and low-risk. Activision's franchises — Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Overwatch — generate billions in combined annual revenue. Irvine CA remains the primary hub, with growing presence in Austin. Post-acquisition integration is creating new roles in Game Pass integration, cross-platform services, and Azure gaming infrastructure. [Source: Microsoft Gaming Division 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Activision/MS Level 59-61 = Google L3 = Meta E3 = Amazon L4-L5

**Global Levers**

1. **Microsoft Band Anchoring:** "I want to confirm I'm being placed in the Microsoft comp system at the appropriate level. Microsoft Level 60-61 in Southern California commands $175K-$250K TC per levels.fyi data."
2. **MSFT Stock Stability:** Microsoft stock is one of the most stable equity holdings in tech. Use this to frame the RSU value: "Unlike startup equity or volatile gaming stocks, MSFT RSUs are practically guaranteed value. I'd like a larger RSU grant given the low-risk, high-value nature of Microsoft stock."
3. **Franchise Revenue Anchor:** "Call of Duty alone generates $3B+ annually. As an engineer building these systems, my work directly supports one of the highest-revenue franchises in entertainment."
4. **Post-Acquisition Integration Roles:** New roles created by the Microsoft integration (Game Pass, Azure gaming, cross-platform) often have undefined comp bands — this is an opportunity: "This role didn't exist before the acquisition. Since there's no historical comp data, I'd like to be placed at the top of the Microsoft band for this level."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "I'd like to be placed at Microsoft Level 61 with $160K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus target. The Microsoft integration creates high-impact opportunities, and my skills in [relevant area] directly map to the post-acquisition priorities." Push for $130K+ RSUs and 15% bonus. Accept if TC exceeds $240K.
