**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Activision Blizzard design technical solutions that bridge game studios and centralized platform services. Post-Microsoft acquisition, SA roles have expanded dramatically — now architecting solutions that span Activision's gaming infrastructure, Azure cloud services, Xbox Game Pass integration, and Microsoft's broader technology ecosystem. SAs must understand game engine architecture, cloud-native design patterns, real-time networking, and enterprise-grade platform services. The post-acquisition landscape has created new SA roles around Azure migration architecture, Game Pass content delivery, and cross-platform identity federation. These roles are strategically critical and often have flexible comp bands due to their novelty. [Source: Microsoft Gaming Architecture, Activision Platform 2025]
