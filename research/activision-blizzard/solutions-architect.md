### Solutions Architect | Activision Blizzard (Microsoft/Xbox) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus / Microsoft Comp Bands | Call of Duty Revenue Engine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine / Santa Monica | $170K–$230K | $95K–$230K | 10–15% | $232K–$355K |
| Austin | $150K–$205K | $80K–$195K | 10–15% | $200K–$310K |
| Hyderabad | ₹28L–₹50L | ₹16L–₹35L | 10% | ₹48L–₹90L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Activision Blizzard design technical solutions that bridge game studios and centralized platform services. Post-Microsoft acquisition, SA roles have expanded dramatically — now architecting solutions that span Activision's gaming infrastructure, Azure cloud services, Xbox Game Pass integration, and Microsoft's broader technology ecosystem. SAs must understand game engine architecture, cloud-native design patterns, real-time networking, and enterprise-grade platform services. The post-acquisition landscape has created new SA roles around Azure migration architecture, Game Pass content delivery, and cross-platform identity federation. These roles are strategically critical and often have flexible comp bands due to their novelty. [Source: Microsoft Gaming Architecture, Activision Platform 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Activision/MS SA Level 63-64 = Google L4-L5 Solutions = AWS Solutions Architect IV

**Global Levers**

1. **Azure Migration Architecture:** "The Azure migration is a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar initiative. Solutions architects who can design the target architecture for gaming workloads on Azure are defining the future of Microsoft's gaming infrastructure."
2. **Cross-Ecosystem Design:** "I'll be designing solutions that span Activision studios, Xbox platform, Azure cloud, and Game Pass. This cross-ecosystem scope exceeds typical SA roles."
3. **Novel Role Premium:** "Many post-acquisition SA roles are newly created. Without historical comp data, I should be benchmarked against the top of the Microsoft SA band."
4. **Multi-Studio Technical Alignment:** "Aligning technical standards across Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Sledgehammer, and Blizzard requires deep architectural expertise and exceptional communication skills."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $325K TC at Microsoft Level 64 with $210K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. Post-acquisition architecture work is high-impact and strategically critical — I'm designing the future of Microsoft's gaming platform." Accept at $170K+ RSUs with 15% bonus and $25K–$40K sign-on.
