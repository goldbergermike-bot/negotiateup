**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Activision Blizzard (Microsoft Level 64-65) are principal-level architects who define the technical direction for entire game engines, online service platforms, or cross-franchise technology. The Microsoft acquisition transformed Staff-level comp dramatically — Level 64-65 bands at Microsoft are among the highest individual contributor positions in the industry. Staff SWEs at Activision/Microsoft are expected to influence architecture decisions across multiple franchises (e.g., shared online services for both Call of Duty and World of Warcraft) and drive technical strategy that aligns with Microsoft's broader gaming vision (Game Pass, Azure gaming, cross-platform). There are relatively few Staff-level positions at Activision — competition for these roles is intense, but comp is exceptional. [Source: Microsoft Level 64-65 Gaming Bands 2025]

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting Microsoft Level 65 with $340K RSU/4yr and 20% bonus. At the Staff level, I'm defining Activision's technical architecture — work that directly impacts billions in franchise revenue and Microsoft's gaming platform strategy. My FAANG offers are at $450K+ TC." Accept at $300K+ RSUs with 20% bonus. This is a career-defining position with Microsoft equity upside.
