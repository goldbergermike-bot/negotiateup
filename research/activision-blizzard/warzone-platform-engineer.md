**Negotiation DNA**

This is Activision Blizzard's signature engineering role — the Warzone Platform Engineer. You are building the backend infrastructure, matchmaking systems, anti-cheat platform, and live-service content delivery for Call of Duty: Warzone, the world's most played free-to-play FPS with 100M+ players. Since Microsoft's $69B acquisition of Activision Blizzard closed in 2023, all comp now runs through Microsoft's compensation bands (levels 59-67+), giving Activision engineers access to Microsoft's RSU structure and refresh program. Warzone generates billions in annual revenue through battle pass and cosmetic microtransactions, and the platform team is directly responsible for the infrastructure that enables this revenue. The Warzone platform must handle extreme concurrency spikes (millions of simultaneous players during content drops and seasonal launches).

**Level Mapping:** Activision/MS Level 63-64 = Google L4-L5 = Meta E4-E5 = Amazon L6

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Warzone Platform Engineer builds systems with unique technical challenges:
- **Extreme Concurrency:** Supporting millions of simultaneous players in a real-time competitive FPS with sub-50ms latency requirements
- **Anti-Cheat at Scale:** Engineering the detection and prevention systems for one of the most targeted games by cheat developers
- **Cross-Platform Matchmaking:** Building skill-based matchmaking across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC with unified progression
- **Live-Service Content Pipeline:** Designing the real-time content delivery system for seasonal updates, battle passes, and limited-time events

**Global Levers**

1. **Microsoft Comp Band Access:** "Since the acquisition, I'm now in the Microsoft comp system. I should be benchmarked against Microsoft L63-64 bands, not legacy Activision bands. Microsoft L63-64 in the LA area commands $280K-$380K TC."
2. **Revenue-Critical Platform Frame:** "Warzone generates billions annually, and every second of platform uptime protects that revenue. My infrastructure work directly enables the revenue engine for Microsoft's largest gaming franchise."
3. **Anti-Cheat Scarcity:** "Anti-cheat platform engineering requires reverse engineering skills, kernel-level expertise, and adversarial ML. Fewer than 100 engineers globally have production experience at this level. That scarcity justifies a 20-25% premium."
4. **Game Pass Integration Opportunity:** "With Warzone's integration into Xbox Game Pass ecosystem, there are new platform challenges around subscription-based content delivery, cross-play infrastructure, and unified identity. My experience positions me to lead this integration."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the platform for Microsoft's highest-revenue gaming franchise. I'd like to be placed at Microsoft Level 64 with $250K RSU/4yr and 20% bonus target. Warzone's revenue scale justifies top-of-band positioning, and my competing offers from [EA/Riot/Epic] are at [X]." Microsoft will counter at $200K–$230K RSUs. Accept at $220K+ with sign-on of $30K–$50K. This role has exceptional long-term upside given Microsoft's gaming investment.
