**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Activision Blizzard maintain the CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, and deployment systems for some of the largest game projects in the world. A single Call of Duty build can exceed 200GB — the build and deployment infrastructure is among the most demanding in software engineering. Post-Microsoft acquisition, there is a significant migration to Azure DevOps tooling, creating hybrid infrastructure challenges. DevOps engineers must support multiple studios (Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Sledgehammer, Blizzard) with different tech stacks and ship cadences. Live-service titles require zero-downtime deployment capabilities and automated rollback systems that can respond in seconds. [Source: Activision DevOps, Microsoft Azure Gaming 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Activision/MS DevOps Level 61-63 = Google L3-L4 SRE = Amazon L5-L6 SysDE

**Global Levers**

1. **Azure Migration Expertise:** "The migration to Azure DevOps is a multi-year initiative that needs engineers who understand both legacy and cloud-native infrastructure. My Azure/cloud expertise directly accelerates this strategic priority."
2. **Massive Build Scale:** "Call of Duty builds are 200GB+. The CI/CD infrastructure to compile, test, and deploy these builds across multiple platforms is orders of magnitude more complex than typical software deployment."
3. **Multi-Studio Support Complexity:** "Supporting DevOps across Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Sledgehammer, and Blizzard means managing different toolchains, cultures, and release cadences simultaneously. This multi-tenant complexity is rare."
4. **Live-Service Zero-Downtime:** "Warzone and WoW have millions of concurrent players. Deployments must be zero-downtime with instant rollback capability. My experience with [blue-green/canary/rolling] deployments directly applies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $285K TC at Microsoft Level 62 with $170K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. Azure migration + gaming-scale build infrastructure is a rare skills combination." Accept at $130K+ RSUs with 15% bonus.
