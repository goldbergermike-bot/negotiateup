### Senior Software Engineer | Activision Blizzard (Microsoft/Xbox) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus / Microsoft Comp Bands | Call of Duty Revenue Engine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine / Santa Monica | $165K–$220K | $100K–$240K | 10–15% | $230K–$350K |
| Austin | $145K–$195K | $80K–$200K | 10–15% | $198K–$305K |
| Hyderabad | ₹28L–₹48L | ₹18L–₹38L | 10–15% | ₹50L–₹92L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Activision Blizzard (Microsoft Level 62-63) are the backbone of franchise development — owning major systems in Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, and Overwatch. The Microsoft acquisition elevated comp bands significantly at the Senior level, as Microsoft's L62-63 pays materially more than legacy Activision Senior bands. This is the level where the Microsoft comp system creates the most uplift compared to pre-acquisition Activision comp. Senior SWEs at Activision are expected to own complex systems end-to-end, mentor junior engineers, and influence technical direction within their franchise. The Irvine and Santa Monica offices house the core Call of Duty and Blizzard teams, while Austin has grown as a secondary hub. [Source: Microsoft Gaming Engineering Levels 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Activision/MS Level 62-63 = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Amazon L5-L6

**Global Levers**

1. **Post-Acquisition Comp Uplift:** "Microsoft Level 62-63 comp bands in SoCal are well-documented. I want to ensure my offer reflects the Microsoft system, not pre-acquisition Activision benchmarks. The delta is significant — often 15-25% higher."
2. **Franchise Ownership Premium:** "As a Senior SWE, I'll own systems that directly impact a billion-dollar franchise. This isn't abstract platform work — it's direct revenue-critical development."
3. **WoW/Diablo Technical Depth:** If your role is on Blizzard titles: "World of Warcraft and Diablo have some of the most complex game engines and server architectures in the industry — 20+ years of technical debt and evolution. Senior engineers who can navigate this complexity are rare."
4. **Microsoft Growth Equity:** "MSFT stock has averaged 15-20% annual growth over the past 5 years. An RSU grant at $200K/4yr has significant upside potential — I'd like the initial grant to reflect this growth trajectory."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting Microsoft Level 63 with $220K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. My experience in [relevant systems] maps directly to Activision's franchise development needs, and Microsoft's comp data shows L63 in SoCal at $300K-$350K TC." Push for $180K+ RSUs. Accept if TC exceeds $295K.
