**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Activision Blizzard own the player experience and monetization strategy for some of the most iconic gaming franchises in history. Post-Microsoft acquisition, PMs now have access to Microsoft's comp bands AND the Game Pass ecosystem — creating new PM roles around subscription content strategy, cross-play features, and platform integration. PMs on Call of Duty manage battle pass design, seasonal content cadence, and monetization optimization with direct revenue attribution in the billions. PMs on Blizzard franchises (WoW, Diablo, Overwatch) balance passionate player communities with long-term monetization strategy. This role requires navigating legacy Activision culture, Blizzard culture, and Microsoft culture simultaneously — a unique PM challenge. [Source: Microsoft Gaming Product Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Activision/MS PM Level 62-64 = Google L5-L6 PM = Meta IC5-IC6 PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Billion Dollar Revenue Ownership:** "Call of Duty's annual revenue exceeds $3B. As a PM, my decisions on content cadence, monetization features, and player experience directly impact this revenue. Few PM roles in tech have this level of direct P&L attribution."
2. **Game Pass Strategy Premium:** "Microsoft's Game Pass strategy creates entirely new PM challenges — subscription vs. a-la-carte monetization, content retention metrics, and platform ecosystem design. PMs who understand subscription gaming economics are scarce."
3. **Franchise Community Management:** "Activision and Blizzard have the most passionate (and vocal) player communities in gaming. PMs who can balance community expectations with business objectives have a specialized skill set."
4. **Microsoft PM Band Anchoring:** "I should be benchmarked against Microsoft PM bands, which are well-documented on levels.fyi. PM Level 63-64 in SoCal is $300K-$380K TC."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $340K TC at Microsoft PM Level 63 with $220K RSU/4yr and 20% bonus. My live-service PM experience maps directly to Call of Duty's revenue model, and I bring Game Pass strategy expertise that's critical for the post-acquisition roadmap." Accept at $180K+ RSUs with 20% bonus.
