ML/AI Engineers at Activision Blizzard work on cutting-edge gaming AI — anti-cheat ML, NPC behavior modeling, procedural content generation, player matchmaking optimization, and generative AI for game development acceleration. Post-Microsoft acquisition, ML/AI roles now have access to Azure AI infrastructure, Microsoft Research collaboration, and OpenAI integration possibilities. The anti-cheat ML team (RICOCHET) is one of the most technically demanding ML teams in gaming, using kernel-level machine learning to detect cheaters in real-time. Blizzard's AI research on procedural generation and NPC behavior has produced industry-leading work. The AI premium at Activision is substantial — Microsoft is investing billions in AI across all divisions, and gaming AI is a priority area. [Source: Microsoft Gaming AI, Activision RICOCHET 2025]
