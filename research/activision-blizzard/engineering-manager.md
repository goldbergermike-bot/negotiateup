### Engineering Manager | Activision Blizzard (Microsoft/Xbox) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus / Microsoft Comp Bands | Call of Duty Revenue Engine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine / Santa Monica | $205K–$265K | $160K–$340K | 15–20% | $305K–$450K |
| Austin | $180K–$240K | $135K–$290K | 15–20% | $263K–$395K |
| Hyderabad | ₹38L–₹60L | ₹25L–₹50L | 15% | ₹68L–₹118L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Activision Blizzard now sit within Microsoft's management hierarchy, mapping to Microsoft Level 63-65 Manager. This creates a significant comp advantage — Microsoft EM bands are among the best in the industry. EMs at Activision own team delivery for the world's most high-profile game franchises. A Call of Duty launch reaches 100M+ players — the pressure is enormous, but so is the reward. Post-acquisition, EMs navigate a dual culture (Activision's ship-focused intensity + Microsoft's process-driven rigor), which requires exceptional leadership skills. EMs who manage integration-related workstreams (Game Pass, Azure migration, cross-platform tooling) carry strategic importance beyond normal franchise delivery.

**Level Mapping:** Activision/MS EM Level 63-65 = Google L5-L6 Manager = Meta M1-M2 = Amazon L7 Manager

**Global Levers**

1. **Microsoft EM Bands:** "Microsoft EM Level 63-65 in SoCal is well-benchmarked. I want to ensure my offer reflects the Microsoft system — EM comp at these levels is $305K-$450K TC."
2. **Franchise Launch Pressure:** "Managing a team that ships Call of Duty or WoW content is among the highest-pressure EM roles in gaming. Launch windows are immovable, player expectations are extreme, and revenue impact is measured in billions."
3. **Integration Leadership Premium:** "The Microsoft-Activision integration creates unique management challenges — aligning engineering cultures, migrating systems, and maintaining delivery velocity during organizational change. EMs who can navigate this deserve a premium."
4. **Retention During Integration:** "Post-acquisition attrition is highest in the first 2-3 years. As EM, I'm directly responsible for retaining key talent during the most volatile period. Each engineer I retain saves $200K+ in replacement costs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting Microsoft EM Level 64 with $300K RSU/4yr and 20% bonus. Managing franchise delivery during a major acquisition integration requires exceptional leadership, and my experience at [previous company] during [similar transition] directly transfers." Accept at $260K+ RSUs with 20% bonus and $30K–$50K sign-on.
