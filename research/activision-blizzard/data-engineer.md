**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Activision Blizzard build the pipelines and infrastructure that process massive telemetry from 400M+ monthly active players across Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, and Overwatch. Post-Microsoft acquisition, the data platform is migrating to Azure-based infrastructure, creating new roles around Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse, and Fabric. This migration gives data engineers at Activision exposure to both legacy gaming data infrastructure and cutting-edge Azure data services. Data engineering is critical to every major decision at Activision — matchmaking tuning, content scheduling, monetization optimization, and anti-cheat detection all depend on real-time and batch data pipelines.
