**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Activision Blizzard shape the interface, HUD, menu systems, social features, and monetization UX for the most recognizable gaming franchises on the planet. Blizzard's design philosophy is legendary — the company's "easy to learn, difficult to master" principle has influenced an entire generation of game designers. Post-Microsoft acquisition, designers also work on Game Pass integration, cross-platform UX, and Xbox ecosystem features. Activision/Blizzard designers sit within Microsoft's design levels, benefiting from Microsoft's well-structured comp bands. The design function at Blizzard has historically been revered, and Blizzard's design culture remains distinct even post-acquisition. [Source: Microsoft Gaming Design Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Activision/MS Design Level 61-63 = Google L4 UX = Apple ICT3 Design

**Global Levers**

1. **Franchise UX Revenue Impact:** "The UX I design for Call of Duty's battle pass flow, WoW's subscription management, or Diablo's in-game store directly impacts conversion rates and revenue. Gaming UX has clearer revenue attribution than enterprise UX."
2. **Blizzard Design Legacy:** "Blizzard's design standard is world-renowned. Joining this design team means contributing to one of the most influential design cultures in gaming history — that prestige has recruitment value."
3. **Cross-Platform Design Complexity:** "Designing for console controller, mouse/keyboard, and mobile touch simultaneously is a specialized skill. Cross-platform design systems are complex and scarce."
4. **Microsoft Design Bands:** "Microsoft design roles at Level 62-63 in SoCal have clear comp data. I should be benchmarked against the Microsoft system, not legacy Activision bands."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $265K TC with $150K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. Gaming product design is specialized, and my portfolio demonstrates direct revenue impact through UX optimization across [platforms]." Accept at $120K+ RSUs with sign-on of $15K–$25K.
