### Security Engineer | Activision Blizzard (Microsoft/Xbox) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus / Microsoft Comp Bands | Call of Duty Revenue Engine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine / Santa Monica | $165K–$225K | $90K–$220K | 10–15% | $222K–$340K |
| Austin | $145K–$200K | $75K–$185K | 10–15% | $192K–$298K |
| Hyderabad | ₹26L–₹48L | ₹16L–₹35L | 10% | ₹46L–₹88L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Activision Blizzard protect one of the most attacked gaming platforms in the world. Call of Duty alone faces constant DDoS campaigns, account takeover attacks, and cheat-developer reverse engineering. Post-Microsoft acquisition, security engineers now operate within Microsoft's security organization — one of the most mature and well-resourced security teams in the industry. This means access to Microsoft's threat intelligence, security tooling, and incident response infrastructure. Security roles span application security, network security, identity protection (400M+ accounts), anti-fraud, and the RICOCHET anti-cheat system. The gaming security threat landscape is uniquely adversarial — motivated attackers, organized crime, and nation-state-level cheat development operations.

**Level Mapping:** Activision/MS Security Level 62-64 = Google L4-L5 Security = Amazon L6 Security

**Global Levers**

1. **Microsoft Security Organization:** "Joining Microsoft's security organization gives me access to the world's most advanced threat intelligence and security infrastructure. My comp should reflect the Microsoft security band, not legacy Activision benchmarks."
2. **Gaming Threat Landscape Expertise:** "Gaming security faces unique threats — DDoS, account takeover, virtual economy fraud, cheat development. Security engineers with gaming-specific experience are rare and command a premium."
3. **Account Protection at Scale:** "Activision manages 400M+ player accounts. Securing this identity system at scale, with high-value virtual assets, requires specialized expertise in identity security and fraud prevention."
4. **Anti-Cheat Security Bridge:** "The intersection of security engineering and anti-cheat (RICOCHET) is an incredibly specialized field. Reverse engineering, kernel security, and adversarial ML are all required. This combination is extremely scarce."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $310K TC at Microsoft Security Level 63 with $195K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. Gaming security is specialized and scarce, and Microsoft's security organization represents the gold standard. Competing offers from [FAANG security] are at [X]." Accept at $160K+ RSUs with 15% bonus.
