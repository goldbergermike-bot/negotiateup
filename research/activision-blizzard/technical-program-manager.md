**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Activision Blizzard coordinate the delivery of AAA game launches, live-service updates, platform migrations, and post-acquisition integration programs. Call of Duty launches are among the highest-stakes delivery events in entertainment — coordinating across Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Sledgehammer, QA, platform certification, marketing, and live operations. Post-Microsoft acquisition, TPMs also manage Azure migration programs, Game Pass integration timelines, and cross-studio technology standardization initiatives. The integration has created a unique TPM challenge: aligning Activision's ship-focused culture with Microsoft's process-driven approach while maintaining delivery velocity.

**Level Mapping:** Activision/MS TPM Level 62-64 = Google L4-L5 TPM = Amazon L6-L7 TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **AAA Launch Coordination:** "Coordinating a Call of Duty launch — across 3 studios, 5 platforms, QA, certification, marketing, and live ops — is one of the most complex program management challenges in entertainment. My comp should reflect this delivery complexity."
2. **Integration Program Leadership:** "Post-acquisition integration programs are high-visibility, high-impact, and high-risk. TPMs who successfully manage these programs are essential to realizing the acquisition's value."
3. **Microsoft TPM Bands:** "Microsoft TPM Level 63-64 in SoCal is well-benchmarked. My offer should reflect the Microsoft system — $280K-$335K TC."
4. **Multi-Studio Coordination:** "Managing programs across studios with different cultures, codebases, and timelines requires exceptional stakeholder management and technical depth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $310K TC at Microsoft Level 63 with $190K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. Managing AAA launches and post-acquisition integration simultaneously is among the most demanding TPM work in tech." Accept at $150K+ RSUs with 15% bonus and $20K–$35K sign-on.
