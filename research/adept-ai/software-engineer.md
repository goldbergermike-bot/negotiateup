**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Adept AI build the platform and product infrastructure for AI agents — the agent execution environment, the software interaction layer, the workflow orchestration system, and the enterprise deployment platform. SWEs at Adept work on uniquely challenging problems: building systems that can reliably interact with arbitrary software, handle errors gracefully, and execute complex multi-step workflows autonomously. Amazon's involvement provides infrastructure and enterprise distribution advantages.
