**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Adept AI face one of the most complex security challenges in AI — securing autonomous AI agents that interact with real software on behalf of users. You'll design sandboxed execution environments, implement permission and access control systems for agents, prevent adversarial attacks that could cause agents to take harmful actions, and build the trust infrastructure that makes enterprise customers confident in agent autonomy. Agent security is a new discipline with no established playbook.
