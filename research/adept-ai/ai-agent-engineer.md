**Negotiation DNA**
The AI Agent Engineer is Adept AI's signature role — the position at the core of building AI agents that can interact with any software tool on behalf of users. Adept's ACT-1 model and subsequent systems represent a fundamentally different approach to AI: rather than generating text or images, Adept's agents observe screens, understand software interfaces, and take actions — clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating applications, and executing multi-step workflows autonomously. This is the frontier of AI: building systems that can use tools the way humans do. Following the Amazon acquisition of key team members and technology, this role benefits from Amazon's resources while maintaining the startup-level innovation pace. The +15-30% ML Premium reflects the extreme scarcity of engineers who can build autonomous AI agents that reliably interact with arbitrary software.

**Level Mapping:** Adept AI Agent Engineer = Google L5-L6 Research Engineer = Amazon Applied Scientist III-IV = Meta AI Research Scientist IC5-IC6

**The Amazon Partnership Premium**
Amazon's acquisition of Adept's team and technology provides compute resources, enterprise distribution, and technical stability. This de-risks the equity while maintaining the AI agents mission. Use this: "Adept's Amazon partnership provides resources and distribution that most AI startups can't match, while the agent-focused mission remains. The equity is de-risked by Amazon's involvement."

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Scarcity:** "Building AI agents that can autonomously interact with arbitrary software interfaces is one of the hardest problems in AI. It requires computer vision, action prediction, reinforcement learning, and robust software interaction — fewer than 300 engineers in the world have production experience with this: $285K base and $370K equity/4yr."
2. **Agentic AI Premium (+15-30%):** "Agentic AI is the hottest area in the AI industry. My expertise in building autonomous agents that interact with real software commands a significant market premium: $280K base."
3. **Competing Offers:** "OpenAI is offering me $275K / $600K equity for agentic AI work. Anthropic at $270K / $500K equity for tool-use research. Adept's focused agent mission is compelling — $285K base and $375K equity/4yr."
4. **Amazon Resource Leverage:** "With Amazon's compute and enterprise relationships, my agent systems can reach enterprise customers faster. That distribution advantage amplifies my impact: $280K base."
5. **Enterprise Automation Value:** "AI agents that automate enterprise software workflows create enormous value — each automation can save enterprises millions. That value creation: $285K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm an AI agent engineer who has built autonomous systems that interact with software — screen understanding, action prediction, multi-step workflow execution. I'm holding an OpenAI offer at $275K / $600K equity and an Anthropic offer at $270K / $500K equity for agentic AI work. Adept's singular focus on AI agents is the most compelling mission in the industry, and the Amazon partnership provides distribution and resources. To join: $285K base, $370K equity/4yr, and a $55K signing bonus. The ML Premium applies — agentic AI expertise is in extraordinary demand. At $285K, I commit immediately. Floor is $255K."
