### DevOps Engineer | Adept AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth Comp + Pre-IPO Equity | $1B+ Valuation (Amazon Acquired Team) | San Francisco | Agent Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K-$215K | $80K-$235K | — | $180K-$274K |
| Seattle | $155K-$209K | $80K-$235K | — | $175K-$268K |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Adept AI manage the infrastructure for AI agent execution — isolated sandboxed environments where agents interact with software, GPU clusters for model inference, scalable agent orchestration, and the monitoring systems that ensure reliable agent operation. Agent infrastructure is uniquely complex: agents need secure, isolated execution environments with access to real software, real-time GPU inference, and robust error handling.

**Level Mapping:** Adept DevOps = Amazon SDE/DevOps II = Google L3-L4 SRE

**The Amazon Partnership Premium**
AWS infrastructure provides advantages, but agent execution environments require specialized architecture.

**Global Levers**
1. **Agent Execution Infrastructure:** "Building secure, scalable agent execution environments is a novel infrastructure challenge — sandboxed environments with real software access: $210K base and $225K equity/4yr."
2. **Amazon Benchmark:** "Amazon DevOps engineers earn $190K+ base: $210K base."
3. **Competing Offers:** "Datadog offers $200K / $220K RSU. AWS SRE at $195K / $200K RSU. Adept: $210K base."
4. **Security + Scale:** "Agent environments must be both secure (sandboxed) and performant (real-time inference). That dual requirement: $205K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a DevOps engineer with sandboxed execution and GPU infrastructure experience. Holding Datadog at $200K / $220K RSU. Adept's agent infrastructure challenges: $210K base, $220K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. Floor is $185K."
