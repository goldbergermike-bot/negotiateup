**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Adept AI manage the infrastructure for AI agent execution — isolated sandboxed environments where agents interact with software, GPU clusters for model inference, scalable agent orchestration, and the monitoring systems that ensure reliable agent operation. Agent infrastructure is uniquely complex: agents need secure, isolated execution environments with access to real software, real-time GPU inference, and robust error handling.
