#### Compensation Benchmarks by Region

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Medallion Access Value | Total Comp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| East Setauket HQ (Long Island) | $310K - $350K | $150K - $300K | $190K - $300K | $650K - $950K |
| New York City | $320K - $350K | $160K - $310K | $190K - $300K | $670K - $960K |
| Remote US (Very Rare) | $295K - $340K | $130K - $260K | $155K - $250K | $580K - $850K |

*+15-25% AI/Quant Premium over standard engineering compensation reflects the extreme scarcity of ML engineers with quantitative finance domain expertise and the direct alpha-generation potential of ML systems.*

#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at Renaissance Technologies sit at the intersection of the firm's two greatest competitive advantages: world-class quantitative research and cutting-edge computational infrastructure. At the most secretive and successful quant fund in history — founded by mathematician Jim Simons — ML engineers build the machine learning systems that discover, validate, and operationalize trading signals for the Medallion Fund, which has delivered approximately 66% annual returns before fees. This is not a typical ML engineering role building recommendation engines or chatbots — it is the application of advanced statistical learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and novel ML architectures to the hardest prediction problem in the world: financial markets. The deeply academic culture means ML engineers work alongside PhDs in mathematics, physics, and computer science who push the boundaries of what is computationally possible. The +15-25% AI/Quant Premium reflects the extraordinary scarcity of engineers who combine deep ML expertise with quantitative finance fluency. Base salaries reach the top of the $310K-$350K range, with total compensation of $650K-$950K through substantial bonuses and significant Medallion Fund allocations that compound into generational wealth.

#### Medallion Fund Access — The Gold Standard of Quant Performance

The Medallion Fund is the single most valuable negotiation lever in quantitative finance. With approximately 66% annual returns before fees — a track record unmatched by any fund in history — access to the Medallion Fund transforms standard compensation into extraordinary wealth accumulation. The fund is closed to outside investors and available only to current and select former employees, making it a perk that cannot be replicated at any competing firm.

For an ML/AI Engineer, Medallion Fund access is exceptionally valuable because the role directly contributes to the models and systems that generate fund returns. Allocations of $500K-$900K are realistic for ML engineers whose systems produce measurable alpha, generating $150K-$360K in annual investment returns at the fund's historical 30-40% net return rate. Over a 5-year tenure, cumulative Medallion gains can exceed $1.5M-$2.5M beyond salary and bonus.

ML engineers have the strongest negotiation position for Medallion allocation among all engineering roles because their work product — predictive models and signal generation systems — has the most direct and measurable impact on fund returns. A single ML model that identifies a previously unknown market pattern can generate millions in additional annual returns. Candidates should negotiate Medallion access aggressively, treating it as the single most important component of compensation. The 5-year NPV of a $700K Medallion allocation compounding at 35% net returns exceeds $2M — an amount that no competing cash or equity package can match.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — AI/Quant Talent War Premium:** "ML engineers with quantitative finance expertise are the scarcest talent in the market. I have competing offers from Two Sigma at $340K base with $300K in guaranteed first-year compensation and from a FAANG AI lab at $350K base with $500K+ in RSUs. The +15-25% AI/Quant Premium needs to be reflected in both my base ($350K) and my Medallion allocation timeline (immediate access)."

2. **Lever 2 — Signal Generation Track Record:** "My ML models at [competitor/research lab] identified novel signals that generated $20M+ in annual PnL. This demonstrated ability to build alpha-generating systems justifies an immediate Medallion allocation of $700K and a bonus structure that rewards production signal contributions with allocation increases."

3. **Lever 3 — Research Publication and Academic Credentials:** "My PhD in machine learning and published work on [specific ML technique] at NeurIPS/ICML demonstrates the academic rigor that Renaissance values. I am requesting a $345K base and a research contribution bonus of up to $275K, reflecting both my production engineering skills and my ability to advance the firm's ML research frontier."

4. **Lever 4 — Non-Compete and Knowledge Lock-In:** "Renaissance's non-compete is particularly impactful for ML engineers, as my skills and experience building proprietary ML trading systems would be directly applicable at competing quant funds. A 2-year non-compete removes $1.5M-$2M in earning potential. I need a $350K base, $250K+ target bonus, and an immediate Medallion allocation of $700K+ to compensate for this constraint."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $350K base with a $275K target bonus and immediate Medallion Fund access with a $700K initial allocation. If the initial offer is $310K base and $150K bonus, counter with $340K base, $240K target bonus, and a written commitment to immediate Medallion access at a $600K minimum allocation. Leverage competing Two Sigma, DE Shaw, or FAANG AI offers in the $600K-$850K total cash range. Accept at $325K+ base and $220K+ bonus only if Medallion access is confirmed within 6 months with a minimum $500K allocation. Walk away below $310K base — the AI/Quant talent market gives you full leverage.
