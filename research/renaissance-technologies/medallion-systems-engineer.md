#### Negotiation DNA

The Medallion Systems Engineer is the **SIGNATURE ROLE** at Renaissance Technologies — the engineering position most directly responsible for the performance of the Medallion Fund, which has delivered approximately 66% annual returns before fees and stands as the gold standard of quantitative performance in the history of finance. Founded by mathematician Jim Simons, Renaissance is the most secretive and successful quant fund ever created, and Medallion Systems Engineers are the builders of its core revenue engine.

This role encompasses the design, construction, and optimization of three mission-critical systems:

- **Signal Generation Infrastructure:** Building the computational pipelines that transform raw data and research hypotheses into actionable trading signals. These systems process thousands of potential signals daily, applying statistical validation, out-of-sample testing, and correlation analysis to identify the patterns that drive Medallion returns.

- **Backtesting Infrastructure:** Designing and maintaining the historical simulation frameworks that allow researchers to test trading strategies against decades of market data with microsecond precision. The integrity of the backtesting system is paramount — any bias or data leakage can lead to catastrophic capital allocation decisions.

- **Execution Infrastructure:** Building the low-latency systems that translate validated signals into actual market orders, optimizing for execution quality, slippage minimization, and market impact reduction across global markets and asset classes.

The +25-35% Medallion Systems Premium is the highest premium at the firm, reflecting the fact that every line of code in these systems has a direct, measurable impact on billions of dollars in fund performance. Base salaries are at the ceiling of the $340K-$350K range, with total compensation of $900K-$1.35M achieved through extraordinary bonuses and the largest Medallion Fund allocations available to any engineering role. This is not merely a job — it is stewardship of the most profitable trading system ever built.

#### Medallion Fund Access — The Gold Standard of Quant Performance

The Medallion Fund is the single most valuable negotiation lever in quantitative finance. With approximately 66% annual returns before fees — a track record unmatched by any fund in history — access to the Medallion Fund transforms standard compensation into extraordinary wealth accumulation. The fund is closed to outside investors and available only to current and select former employees, making it a perk that cannot be replicated at any competing firm.

**For the Medallion Systems Engineer, fund access is not merely a perk — it is the defining element of total compensation and the primary reason this role is the most coveted engineering position in quantitative finance.**

Medallion Systems Engineers receive the largest allocations available to any engineering role, typically $1M-$2M+, reflecting their direct stewardship of the fund's core infrastructure. At the fund's historical 30-40% net return rate, a $1.5M allocation generates $450K-$600K in annual investment returns — effectively doubling visible compensation. Over a 5-year tenure, cumulative Medallion gains can exceed $3.5M-$5M beyond salary and bonus. Over a 10-year tenure, the compounding effect alone can generate $8M-$12M in wealth beyond cash compensation.

The negotiation calculus is fundamentally different for this role:

- **Immediate access is non-negotiable.** Any delay in Medallion allocation for a Medallion Systems Engineer is a red flag. The role exists to build and improve the fund's core systems — denying fund access to the engineer responsible for fund infrastructure would be contradictory.
- **Allocation size is the primary negotiation variable.** The difference between a $1M and a $2M initial allocation, compounded over 5 years at 35% net returns, exceeds $2M. This is where negotiation effort should be concentrated.
- **Allocation growth schedule matters.** Negotiate for annual allocation increases tied to fund performance and individual contribution. A 20% annual allocation increase on a $1.5M base generates an additional $300K in investment capacity each year.

No competing offer from any firm in finance or technology can replicate this compensation structure. A $2M Medallion allocation is the equivalent of being given a personal money-printing machine with a 30-40% annual yield. Candidates must understand this and negotiate accordingly.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Fund-Critical Systems Premium:** "As a Medallion Systems Engineer, my work directly determines the quality of signal generation, backtesting fidelity, and execution efficiency for the Medallion Fund. Every basis point of improvement I deliver translates to millions in additional fund returns. I am requesting the maximum base of $350K, a $400K+ target bonus, and an immediate Medallion allocation of $1.5M. The +25-35% Medallion Systems Premium reflects the unique and irreplaceable nature of this role."

2. **Lever 2 — Competing Principal-Level Offers:** "I have a principal-level offer from Citadel at $375K base with a $500K guaranteed first-year bonus and significant equity. I also have interest from DE Shaw's core trading systems team at comparable levels. While I recognize that Medallion access is unmatched, the cash and bonus structure needs to compete with the top of the quant fund principal engineer market — $350K base with a $400K minimum target bonus."

3. **Lever 3 — Backtesting and Execution Track Record:** "At my current firm, I redesigned the core backtesting infrastructure to eliminate survivorship bias and look-ahead errors, which increased strategy Sharpe ratios by 0.3 on average. I also reduced execution latency by 65% and decreased slippage by 25 basis points. These improvements generated an estimated $50M in additional annual PnL. This track record justifies the maximum Medallion allocation — $2M+ — and a bonus structure that rewards continued infrastructure improvements."

4. **Lever 4 — Career Lock-In and Non-Compete:** "The combination of Renaissance's non-compete agreement (the most restrictive in finance), the deep knowledge of proprietary systems I will accumulate, and the effective career lock-in created by Medallion access (leaving means forgoing extraordinary compounding returns) means I am making a long-term commitment with significant opportunity costs. I need the full Medallion Systems Premium: $350K base, $425K+ target bonus, immediate $1.5M Medallion allocation, and a guaranteed 15% annual allocation increase for the first 5 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $350K base with a $425K target bonus and immediate Medallion Fund access with a $1.5M initial allocation and a guaranteed annual increase schedule. If the initial offer is $340K base and $250K bonus, counter with $350K base (non-negotiable at this level), $400K target bonus, and a written commitment to immediate Medallion access at $1.25M with 15% annual allocation increases. Leverage competing Citadel or DE Shaw principal-level offers in the $850K-$1.1M total cash range, but emphasize that you are choosing Renaissance for the Medallion allocation — making the allocation terms the true negotiation battleground. Accept at $345K+ base and $375K+ bonus only if Medallion access is immediate with an allocation of $1M+ and documented growth terms. **Do not accept this role without immediate Medallion access and a minimum $1M allocation — these terms are the entire reason this role exists at the top of the engineering compensation hierarchy.**
