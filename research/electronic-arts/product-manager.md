**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at EA own the player experience and monetization strategy for franchises generating billions in annual revenue. EA's live-service model means PMs are not shipping a product and moving on — they're continuously optimizing engagement, retention, and revenue across daily/weekly content cycles. PMs on EA Sports FC Ultimate Team, Madden Ultimate Team, or Apex Legends have direct P&L ownership that rivals PM roles at top tech companies. EA PMs must balance player satisfaction with monetization — a unique skill set that commands a premium. The PM career track at EA runs PM → Senior PM → Director of Product → VP of Product, with comp increasing sharply at each level. [Source: EA Product Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** EA PM (L2) = Google L5 PM = Meta IC5 PM = Amazon L6 PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Direct Revenue Attribution:** "EA PMs have clearer revenue attribution than most tech PMs. I'll be directly responsible for features that drive Ultimate Team spend, battle pass conversions, or engagement metrics that correlate with revenue. My comp should reflect this P&L ownership."
2. **Live-Service Monetization Expertise:** If you have experience with free-to-play, gacha, battle pass, or live-service monetization: "Live-service monetization PM talent is scarce. The intersection of player experience and revenue optimization is a specialized skill that commands a premium over generic PM roles."
3. **Player Engagement Metrics:** PMs who can demonstrate improving DAU, D30 retention, or ARPDAU at previous companies have strong leverage: "I increased D30 retention by [X]% at [company], directly translating to $[Y] in additional revenue."
4. **Cross-Platform Strategy:** EA is pushing cross-platform play aggressively. PMs with cross-platform experience: "I've managed cross-platform product strategy across console, PC, and mobile — exactly where EA is investing heavily."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $300K TC with $180K RSU/4yr and 20% bonus target. My live-service PM experience maps directly to EA's revenue model, and I have competing offers from Riot and Epic at comparable comp." EA will counter at $120K–$150K RSUs. Push to $160K+ RSUs with 20% bonus. Accept if TC exceeds $270K.
