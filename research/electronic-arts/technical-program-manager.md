**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at EA coordinate the delivery of some of the most complex software projects in entertainment — game launches, platform migrations, live-service infrastructure upgrades, and cross-studio technology initiatives. EA's annual sports title cycle (EA Sports FC, Madden, NHL, etc.) requires military-precision launch coordination across studios, QA, platform certification (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo), marketing, and live operations. TPMs on cross-studio platform teams manage programs that impact every franchise simultaneously. The post-restructuring consolidation has expanded TPM scope as more shared services are centralized. EA's TPM role requires genuine technical depth — you must understand game engine architecture, cloud infrastructure, and live-service systems to be effective. [Source: EA Program Management 2025]

**Level Mapping:** EA TPM ICT3 = Google L4 TPM = Amazon L6 TPM = Microsoft 63 TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Launch Criticality:** "EA Sports title launches are some of the highest-stakes delivery events in entertainment — millions of players on day one, console certification deadlines, marketing commitments. As TPM, I own the delivery timeline for these launches."
2. **Cross-Studio Coordination Premium:** "I'll be coordinating programs across 20+ studios with different codebases, cultures, and timelines. This multi-studio coordination complexity exceeds typical TPM scope."
3. **Platform Certification Expertise:** If you have experience with console certification (Sony TRC, Microsoft XR): "Platform certification knowledge is specialized and directly impacts launch timing. A failed cert costs weeks of delay and millions in revenue."
4. **Post-Restructuring Program Complexity:** "EA's restructuring created new cross-studio dependencies. TPMs who can manage this increased complexity are essential to successful delivery."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $270K TC with $145K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. Managing cross-studio game launches at EA's scale requires both technical depth and exceptional program management — skills I demonstrated at [previous company] shipping [comparable projects]." EA will counter at $90K–$110K RSUs. Push to $120K+ with 15% bonus. Accept if TC exceeds $245K.
