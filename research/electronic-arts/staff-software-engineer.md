### Staff Software Engineer | Electronic Arts Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus | Sports-Gaming Revenue Machine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $185K–$245K | $150K–$320K | 15–20% | $285K–$430K |
| Orlando | $165K–$220K | $125K–$270K | 15–20% | $245K–$380K |
| Bucharest | €70K–€100K | €40K–€75K | 15% | €120K–€190K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at EA (ICT4) are principal-level architects who define the technical direction across entire game platforms or shared services. At EA's $38B market cap, Staff SWEs are among the highest-compensated individual contributors, often rivaling Director-level management comp. The Staff level at EA is relatively rare — fewer than 15% of engineers reach this level — and they're expected to influence architecture decisions that span multiple studios and franchises. Staff SWEs on the Frostbite engine team, shared online services, or EA Sports FC platform command the highest comp bands. EA increased Staff-level comp bands by 10-15% in 2025 to compete with FAANG retention offers. [Source: EA ICT4 Engineering Bands 2025]

**Level Mapping:** EA ICT4 (Staff) = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Microsoft 65-66

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Studio Architecture Influence:** "As a Staff SWE, I'll be defining technical standards across EA's studio portfolio. When I improve a shared system, it impacts FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, and The Sims simultaneously — that's multi-billion-dollar leverage."
2. **FAANG Retention Counteroffer:** EA's biggest talent competitor is FAANG. If you have FAANG offers: "Google/Meta is offering [X] for a Staff-level role. EA needs to be competitive to attract architecture-level talent from big tech."
3. **Frostbite Engine Scarcity:** Staff SWEs on the Frostbite team are exceptionally rare. If your role touches the engine: "Frostbite engine expertise doesn't exist outside EA — the company can't hire this skillset from the market. That scarcity should be reflected in comp."
4. **Bonus Target Escalation:** At the Staff level, push bonus from 15% to 20%: "Staff-level impact drives outsized business outcomes. A 20% bonus target with strong multiplier upside properly aligns my incentives with EA's revenue goals."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $400K total comp with $280K RSU/4yr and 20% bonus target. At the Staff level, I'm setting architectural direction that impacts billions in franchise revenue. My FAANG alternative offers are at $420K–$450K TC." EA will counter at $220K–$260K RSUs. Push to $260K+ with 20% bonus. Accept if TC exceeds $380K — Staff SWE at EA is a strong career position with meaningful equity upside.
