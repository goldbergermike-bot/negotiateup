**Negotiation DNA**

This is EA's signature engineering role for 2026 — the EA Sports FC Platform Engineer. You are building the backend platform, matchmaking infrastructure, live-service content delivery, and cross-platform runtime that powers the world's most popular sports video game franchise (formerly FIFA, now EA Sports FC). EA Sports FC generates over $2B annually in net revenue, with the majority from Ultimate Team live-service microtransactions. EA's $38B market cap is heavily anchored to the success of this franchise. Engineers on this platform directly impact revenue through uptime, matchmaking quality, and content delivery speed. EA's transition from the FIFA brand to EA Sports FC in 2023 was the largest rebranding in gaming history — the platform team ensured zero disruption to 150M+ players.

**Level Mapping:** EA ICT3 (Senior) = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Microsoft 63

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The EA Sports FC Platform Engineer builds systems unlike anything in traditional enterprise engineering:
- **Live-Service Content Pipeline:** Designing the real-time content delivery system that pushes daily Ultimate Team updates to 150M+ players across 6 platforms
- **Matchmaking at Scale:** Engineering the skill-based matchmaking infrastructure that processes millions of concurrent matches with sub-100ms latency requirements
- **Cross-Platform Identity:** Building the unified player identity and progression system across PlayStation, Xbox, PC, Switch, and mobile
- **Microtransaction Infrastructure:** The payment and item delivery pipeline that processes billions in annual transactions with zero-downtime requirements

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue-Generating Platform Frame:** "EA Sports FC's Ultimate Team generates over $1.5B annually in live-service revenue. Every millisecond of downtime in the platform I build costs EA measurable revenue. My comp should reflect the direct revenue responsibility of this role."
2. **No-Equivalent-Role Scarcity:** "There are fewer than 5 companies in the world running live-service gaming platforms at this scale. The talent pool for someone who understands matchmaking, content delivery, and microtransaction infrastructure simultaneously is extremely thin."
3. **Live-Service Platform Premium (15-25%):** Push for the full 25%: "I'm not building a static product — I'm maintaining a 24/7 live-service platform that generates revenue every second. This operational complexity deserves the premium."
4. **FIFA-to-FC Migration Expertise:** If you have experience with large-scale platform migrations, frame it: "I've managed platform migrations affecting millions of users — exactly the type of expertise EA needed for the FIFA-to-FC transition and will need for future platform evolution."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the revenue engine for EA's most valuable franchise. I'd like the RSU grant at $220K over 4 years with the live-service platform premium fully applied, plus a sign-on bonus of $30K–$50K to bridge the 1-year cliff. EA Sports FC generates $2B+ annually, and my platform work directly protects that revenue." EA will counter at $180K–$200K RSUs — accept at $200K+ with sign-on. This is a strong offer for EA's most strategically important platform role.
