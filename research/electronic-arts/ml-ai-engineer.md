### ML/AI Engineer | Electronic Arts Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus | Sports-Gaming Revenue Machine | **+10–20% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $160K–$225K | $90K–$220K | 10–15% | $220K–$340K |
| Orlando | $140K–$200K | $75K–$185K | 10–15% | $190K–$300K |
| Bucharest | €55K–€85K | €25K–€55K | 10–15% | €85K–€148K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at EA work on some of the most unique AI problems in tech: procedural content generation, NPC behavior modeling, dynamic difficulty adjustment, anti-cheat ML, and generative AI for game development acceleration. EA's SEED (Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division) is a world-class research lab that publishes at NeurIPS, SIGGRAPH, and GDC. Applied ML/AI roles directly impact game quality and revenue — matchmaking algorithms affect player satisfaction, content recommendation drives monetization, and AI-assisted development tools improve studio productivity. EA has aggressively invested in generative AI tooling for game development since 2024, creating new ML/AI roles that didn't exist two years ago. [Source: EA SEED Research, EA AI Strategy 2025]

**Level Mapping:** EA ML/AI Engineer ICT3 = Google L4 ML = Meta E4 ML = DeepMind Research Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **Gaming AI Uniqueness:** "Gaming AI problems are fundamentally different from enterprise AI — real-time inference, adversarial environments, player experience optimization. I'm bringing specialized expertise that can't be found in the general ML talent pool."
2. **SEED Research Prestige:** If your role touches SEED: "EA SEED publishes at top-tier venues and its work is cited across the AI community. This research credibility is a recruiting advantage for EA — my contribution to this research output has value beyond my direct engineering work."
3. **Generative AI for Game Dev Premium:** "EA is investing heavily in generative AI tools to accelerate game development. ML engineers who can build production-grade generative systems for art, animation, or level design command a 15-20% premium over standard ML roles."
4. **Anti-Cheat ML Impact:** "Anti-cheat ML directly protects player trust and franchise revenue. An effective anti-cheat system is worth hundreds of millions in preserved player engagement."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $310K TC with $190K RSU/4yr, 15% bonus, and the AI premium applied. My experience in [specific ML domain] maps directly to EA's SEED research priorities and generative AI tooling initiatives. Competing offers from Anthropic/OpenAI/Google are at [X]." EA will counter at $130K–$160K RSUs. Push to $175K+ with a sign-on of $20K–$30K. Accept if TC exceeds $285K.
