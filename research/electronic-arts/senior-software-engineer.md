### Senior Software Engineer | Electronic Arts Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus | Sports-Gaming Revenue Machine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $155K–$210K | $80K–$200K | 10–15% | $210K–$325K |
| Orlando | $135K–$185K | $65K–$170K | 10–15% | $182K–$285K |
| Bucharest | €50K–€80K | €25K–€50K | 10–15% | €80K–€135K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at EA (ICT3) are the workhorse level — owning major systems, leading feature development, and mentoring junior engineers across studios. EA's multi-studio structure (Vancouver, Tiburon, DICE, Respawn, Maxis, Criterion) means Senior SWEs often influence architecture decisions that span multiple game franchises. The $38B market cap is anchored to recurring live-service revenue, and Senior SWEs are directly responsible for the backend systems that generate this revenue. EA's comp at the Senior level includes meaningful RSU grants that vest quarterly after a 1-year cliff, with competitive refresh grants for top performers (typically 50-100% of annual vest amount).

**Level Mapping:** EA ICT3 (Senior SWE) = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Microsoft 63

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Franchise Impact Frame:** "As a Senior SWE at EA, I'll be influencing systems used across multiple billion-dollar franchises — not just one game. My comp should reflect the cross-franchise leverage of this role."
2. **Frostbite/Engine Expertise:** If you have game engine experience (Unreal, Unity, or proprietary), EA's Frostbite engine team pays at the top of band: "Engine engineering talent is the scarcest in gaming. My experience with [engine] directly transfers to Frostbite optimization."
3. **Live-Service Architecture Premium:** Senior SWEs who architect live-service backends command a premium: "I'm not building ship-once software — I'm architecting always-on systems that generate daily revenue."
4. **Refresh Grant Leverage:** EA's refresh grants are discretionary. Ask directly: "What does the refresh grant distribution look like for top-performing Senior SWEs? I want to understand the 4-year equity trajectory, not just the initial grant."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $300K total comp with $180K RSU/4yr grant and 15% bonus. My live-service backend experience directly maps to EA's highest-revenue systems, and I have competing offers from [Riot/Epic/Unity] at comparable levels." EA will counter at $140K–$160K RSUs. Push to $170K+ RSUs — EA has meaningful flex at the Senior level. Accept if TC exceeds $275K with 15% bonus target.
