### Data Engineer | Electronic Arts Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus | Sports-Gaming Revenue Machine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $140K–$195K | $60K–$160K | 10–15% | $178K–$280K |
| Orlando | $120K–$170K | $50K–$135K | 10–15% | $153K–$245K |
| Bucharest | €42K–€68K | €15K–€35K | 10% | €61K–€108K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at EA build the pipelines, warehouses, and real-time streaming infrastructure that process petabytes of player telemetry across 600M+ registered players. EA's data platform ingests billions of in-game events daily — every match played, every item purchased, every session duration — and this data powers live-service optimization, matchmaking algorithms, anti-cheat systems, and business intelligence. EA's SEED (Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division) research team and the central data platform team are the most technically demanding placements. Data engineering at EA is not traditional ETL — it's real-time streaming at gaming scale with sub-second latency requirements. [Source: EA Data Platform Architecture 2025]

**Level Mapping:** EA Data Engineer ICT2-3 = Google L3-L4 Data Eng = Meta E3-E4 Data Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Telemetry Scale Frame:** "EA processes billions of player events daily across 600M+ registered accounts. This isn't standard data engineering — it's real-time streaming at a scale that rivals the largest tech companies. My compensation should reflect this technical complexity."
2. **Live-Service Data Criticality:** "Every live-service decision at EA — content drops, matchmaking tuning, monetization optimization — is data-driven. The data pipelines I build are the foundation for billions in revenue decisions."
3. **Real-Time Streaming Expertise:** If you have experience with Kafka, Flink, or Spark Streaming: "Real-time streaming expertise is directly applicable to EA's telemetry infrastructure. I'm bringing production-ready skills on day one."
4. **Anti-Cheat Data Infrastructure:** Data engineers who can build anomaly detection pipelines for anti-cheat systems are in high demand: "Anti-cheat directly protects player trust and revenue. The data infrastructure for detecting cheaters at scale is a specialized skill."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $255K TC with $140K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. My real-time data engineering experience at scale maps directly to EA's telemetry infrastructure needs, and competing offers from Snowflake and Databricks are at [X]." EA will counter at $90K–$110K RSUs. Push to $120K+ with 15% bonus target. Accept if TC exceeds $230K.
