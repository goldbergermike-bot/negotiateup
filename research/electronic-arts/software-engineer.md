### Software Engineer | Electronic Arts Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus | Sports-Gaming Revenue Machine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $130K–$185K | $50K–$150K | 10–15% | $160K–$265K |
| Orlando | $115K–$165K | $40K–$125K | 10–15% | $140K–$235K |
| Bucharest | €40K–€65K | €15K–€35K | 10% | €58K–€105K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Electronic Arts ($38B market cap, Redwood City CA) is the world's largest sports gaming company, with EA Sports FC (formerly FIFA), Madden NFL, and Apex Legends generating the bulk of revenue. EA's comp structure includes base + RSUs + annual bonus (10-15%), making it a three-lever negotiation. EA's stock has been a steady performer driven by recurring live-service revenue from Ultimate Team across multiple franchises. The company hired aggressively in 2022-2023 then executed layoffs in 2024, meaning current headcount is lean and each new hire carries significant workload expectations. EA's RSU grants vest quarterly after a 1-year cliff, and refresh grants are competitive for top performers. [Source: EA FY2026 Investor Report]

**Level Mapping:** EA ICT2 (SWE) = Google L3 = Meta E3 = Microsoft 59-61

**Global Levers**

1. **Live-Service Revenue Anchor:** "EA generates the majority of its $7.5B revenue from live-service models — Ultimate Team, Apex Legends battle pass, The Sims expansions. As an engineer building these systems, my work has direct, measurable revenue impact."
2. **Three-Lever Negotiation:** Unlike companies with no bonus (e.g., Salesforce), EA offers base + RSU + bonus. If they won't move on base, push RSUs. If RSUs are capped, push bonus target from 10% to 15%. Always negotiate across all three levers.
3. **Post-Layoff Scarcity:** "EA reduced engineering headcount significantly in 2024. The roles you're backfilling now carry the workload of 1.3-1.5 previous engineers. My comp should reflect the increased scope and impact per engineer."
4. **Cross-Studio Value:** EA has multiple studios (EA Vancouver, Tiburon, DICE, Respawn, Maxis). If you can work across studios or on shared platform services, this cross-studio value increases your leverage.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "I'm targeting $240K total comp — $175K base, $130K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus target. EA's lean engineering org means every new hire is high-impact, and I want my comp to reflect that." EA will likely counter at $155K–$165K base with $80K–$100K RSUs. Push back on RSUs first — EA has more flexibility on equity than base. Accept if TC exceeds $220K.
