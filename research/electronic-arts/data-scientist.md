|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $145K–$205K | $70K–$175K | 10–15% | $188K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at EA leverage the richest player behavior dataset in gaming — 600M+ players, billions of daily events, decades of historical data — to optimize live-service experiences, predict churn, personalize content, and model monetization. EA's SEED research division publishes cutting-edge gaming AI research, and applied DS roles directly influence franchise revenue through A/B testing frameworks, player segmentation models, and dynamic pricing algorithms. EA DS roles sit at the intersection of gaming domain expertise and statistical rigor, making this a specialized and premium-compensated discipline. The DS function at EA has expanded post-restructuring as the company doubled down on data-driven decision-making. [Source: EA SEED Research, EA Analytics 2025]

**Level Mapping:** EA Senior Data Scientist = Google L4 DS = Meta IC4 DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Unique Dataset Advantage:** "EA's player behavior dataset is unmatched in gaming — 600M+ players, 20+ years of franchise data. My work as a data scientist leverages a proprietary data moat that no competitor can replicate."
2. **Live-Service Optimization Impact:** "Every model I build — churn prediction, content recommendation, dynamic difficulty — directly impacts engagement and revenue metrics. A 1% improvement in D30 retention across EA's portfolio is worth hundreds of millions."
3. **A/B Testing at Scale:** If you have experience with large-scale experimentation: "I've run experiments at [X] scale. EA's player base allows for statistically significant A/B tests within hours, not weeks — and I know how to design experiments that translate to revenue lift."
4. **Gaming Domain Expertise:** DS professionals with gaming industry knowledge command a premium: "I understand player motivation, engagement loops, and live-service economics. I'm not just a statistician — I'm a gaming data scientist."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $275K TC with $155K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. My expertise in player behavior modeling and live-service optimization directly maps to EA's highest-revenue decisions." EA will counter at $100K–$120K RSUs. Push to $135K+ with 15% bonus target. Accept if TC exceeds $250K.
