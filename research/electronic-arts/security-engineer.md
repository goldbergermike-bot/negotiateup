**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at EA protect one of the most attacked surfaces in the technology industry. Gaming platforms are targeted by DDoS attacks, account takeover campaigns, item duplication exploits, cheat developers, and organized fraud rings. EA's 600M+ registered accounts make it one of the largest identity providers in the world, and EA Sports FC Ultimate Team's virtual economy processes billions in transactions. Security at EA spans application security, anti-cheat infrastructure, account protection, payment fraud prevention, and network security for globally distributed game servers. The gaming industry's security challenges are unique — adversaries are highly motivated (financial gain from virtual items, competitive advantage from cheats), technically sophisticated, and persistent.

**Level Mapping:** EA Security Engineer ICT3 = Google L4 Security = Meta E4 Security

**Global Levers**

1. **Gaming-Specific Threat Landscape:** "EA faces a unique threat model — DDoS, account takeover, cheat development, virtual economy fraud. Security engineers with gaming security experience are extremely rare, and the skills don't fully transfer from enterprise security."
2. **Virtual Economy Protection:** "EA Sports FC's Ultimate Team virtual economy processes billions annually. My work protecting this economy from fraud and exploitation directly preserves revenue."
3. **Anti-Cheat Security Premium:** If you have reverse engineering or anti-cheat experience: "Anti-cheat security is the most specialized subdomain in gaming security. Reverse engineering skills, kernel-level expertise, and adversarial thinking are in extreme demand."
4. **Regulatory Compliance Leverage:** "Gaming companies face increasing regulatory scrutiny — GDPR, children's privacy (COPPA), loot box regulations. Security engineers who understand gaming-specific regulatory requirements save EA significant compliance risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $280K TC with $155K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. Gaming security is specialized and scarce — the intersection of application security, anti-cheat, and virtual economy protection doesn't exist outside gaming. Competing offers from [FAANG security teams] are at [X]." EA will counter at $100K–$120K RSUs. Push to $135K+ with 15% bonus. Accept if TC exceeds $255K.
