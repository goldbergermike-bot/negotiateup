### Engineering Manager | Electronic Arts Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus | Sports-Gaming Revenue Machine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $195K–$255K | $140K–$300K | 15–20% | $275K–$410K |
| Orlando | $175K–$230K | $115K–$255K | 15–20% | $240K–$365K |
| Bucharest | €65K–€95K | €35K–€70K | 15% | €110K–€175K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at EA own the delivery, culture, and talent strategy for teams building the world's most played sports and live-service games. Post-2024 layoffs, EA EMs manage leaner teams with higher per-engineer expectations — meaning the EM role has become more demanding, not less. EMs at EA are expected to be technically credible (most were Senior/Staff SWEs before transitioning), and those managing Frostbite, online services, or franchise platform teams command top-of-band comp. EA's three-lever comp (base + RSU + bonus) gives EMs more negotiation flexibility than single-lever companies. EA's management track runs EM → Senior EM → Director → VP, with meaningful comp jumps at each level. [Source: EA Management Career Framework 2025]

**Level Mapping:** EA EM (M1) = Google L5 Manager = Meta M1 = Microsoft 65 Manager

**Global Levers**

1. **Post-Layoff Team Criticality:** "After EA's headcount reduction, every team is running leaner. As EM, my job is to ensure this smaller team delivers at the same velocity as the larger team it replaced. That operational efficiency is worth a premium."
2. **Retention Economics Frame:** "Engineering attrition at EA costs $150K–$250K per engineer in recruiting, onboarding, and lost productivity. As EM, I'm directly responsible for retention across my team. One prevented departure pays for my entire bonus."
3. **Studio vs. Central Platform:** EMs on central platform teams (online services, Frostbite, data platform) have broader scope than studio-specific EMs. If central: "I'm managing a team whose work impacts every franchise at EA — that's cross-studio leverage that should be reflected in comp."
4. **Bonus Multiplier Negotiation:** EA's bonus has a performance multiplier (0.5x–2.0x). Push for clarity: "What's the typical multiplier distribution for EMs? I want to understand the realistic bonus range, not just the target."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $380K TC with $260K RSU/4yr and 20% bonus target. Managing a high-impact team post-restructuring is harder than managing during growth — I'm delivering more with less. My management experience at [previous company] directly translates to EA's current operational needs." EA will counter at $200K–$240K RSUs. Push to $240K+ with sign-on of $25K–$40K. Accept if TC exceeds $350K.
