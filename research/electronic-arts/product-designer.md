**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at EA shape the player experience for franchises reaching hundreds of millions of players. Unlike traditional enterprise UX, EA designers work at the intersection of game design, UX/UI, and behavioral psychology — designing interfaces, menus, social systems, and monetization flows that directly impact engagement and revenue. EA Sports FC's Ultimate Team UI, Apex Legends' HUD design, and The Sims' creation tools are all product design-driven. EA has invested heavily in design-led product development since 2023, elevating the design function to report directly to studio heads. Design talent with gaming experience is scarce, and EA competes with Riot, Epic, and Blizzard for this specialized talent pool. [Source: EA Design Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** EA Designer II = Google L4 UX = Meta IC4 Design = Apple ICT3 Design

**Global Levers**

1. **Player-Facing Revenue Impact:** "Unlike enterprise design where the connection to revenue is abstract, my design decisions at EA directly influence conversion rates, engagement time, and monetization flows. A 1% improvement in Ultimate Team pack-opening flow conversion is worth millions."
2. **Gaming Design Scarcity:** "Product designers with gaming experience are a fraction of the broader UX market. I'm not just a designer — I understand game feel, player motivation, and the unique UX challenges of real-time interactive experiences."
3. **Cross-Platform Design Systems:** If you have experience building design systems across platforms: "I can create unified design systems that work across console, PC, and mobile — reducing EA's design debt and accelerating cross-platform feature delivery."
4. **Accessibility & Inclusion Premium:** EA has made accessibility a strategic priority. Designers with accessibility expertise: "Accessible design expands EA's addressable market by 15-20%. My accessibility expertise directly drives revenue growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $230K TC with $120K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. Gaming product design is a specialized discipline, and my portfolio demonstrates direct revenue impact through UX optimization." EA will counter at $70K–$90K RSUs. Push to $100K+ with sign-on bonus of $15K–$25K. Accept if TC exceeds $210K.
