### Solutions Architect | Electronic Arts Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus | Sports-Gaming Revenue Machine

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $155K–$215K | $70K–$180K | 10–15% | $200K–$315K |
| Orlando | $135K–$190K | $55K–$150K | 10–15% | $172K–$275K |
| Bucharest | €50K–€78K | €20K–€42K | 10% | €74K–€126K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at EA bridge the gap between game studios and central platform teams, designing technical solutions that enable franchises to leverage shared services — online infrastructure, data platforms, cloud services, and developer tools. SA roles at EA are unique because the "customers" are internal game studios with very specific technical requirements (low latency, high concurrency, real-time state synchronization). SAs must understand both game engine architecture and cloud-native platform design. EA's multi-studio model (20+ studios) creates constant demand for SAs who can standardize technical approaches without constraining creative freedom. Post-restructuring, EA has consolidated more shared services, increasing the scope and strategic importance of SA roles. [Source: EA Platform Architecture Team 2025]

**Level Mapping:** EA Solutions Architect ICT3-4 = Google L4-L5 Solutions = AWS Solutions Architect III

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Studio Scope:** "I'll be designing solutions that span 20+ studios and multiple billion-dollar franchises. This cross-studio scope is broader than most SA roles in tech, where you're typically focused on external customers in a single domain."
2. **Gaming-Specific Architecture:** "Game studio architecture requirements are fundamentally different from enterprise — real-time state sync, low-latency networking, massive concurrency. I bring specialized knowledge that enterprise SAs don't have."
3. **Platform Consolidation Leverage:** "EA's post-restructuring strategy centers on shared platform services. As an SA, I'm directly enabling the cost savings and velocity improvements that justify this consolidation."
4. **Cloud Cost Optimization:** "EA's cloud spend is substantial. Architecture decisions I make can save or cost millions annually. Push for comp that reflects this financial leverage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $290K TC with $160K RSU/4yr and 15% bonus. My SA experience spans [X technologies] with deep expertise in real-time, high-concurrency systems — exactly what EA's studios need from their platform team." EA will counter at $100K–$130K RSUs. Push to $140K+ with 15% bonus. Accept if TC exceeds $260K.
