Rivian Security Engineers protect connected vehicles, cloud infrastructure, customer data, and manufacturing systems from cyber threats. A security breach at an EV manufacturer has consequences beyond data theft — compromised vehicle systems could affect driver safety, and manufacturing disruptions could halt production. Rivian's security scope spans vehicle cybersecurity (CAN bus, OTA update integrity, telematics), cloud infrastructure security, customer data protection, and manufacturing OT security. The role requires a rare combination of automotive cybersecurity expertise and modern cloud security practices. RIVN RSUs provide growth-stage upside. [Source: Rivian Security Engineering Comp 2026]
