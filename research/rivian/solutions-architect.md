**Negotiation DNA**

Rivian Solutions Architects design the system architectures that connect Rivian's vehicle platform, cloud services, manufacturing operations, and partner integrations. As Rivian scales from startup to mature manufacturer, Solutions Architects are critical for designing the integration layer between Rivian's technology and enterprise partners (Amazon fleet integration, charging network partners, service providers, insurance companies). You design APIs, integration patterns, and system architectures that must work reliably for both consumer vehicles and commercial fleet operations. RIVN RSUs provide growth-stage upside.
