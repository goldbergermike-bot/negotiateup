**Negotiation DNA**

Rivian Technical Program Managers coordinate complex programs that span vehicle software, cloud services, manufacturing systems, and supply chain operations. TPMs at a growth-stage EV manufacturer manage programs with unique complexity: hardware-software integration timelines, manufacturing ramp schedules, regulatory milestones, and fleet deployment coordination. A single vehicle feature may require coordination across embedded software teams, cloud services, manufacturing line changes, and supplier certification. Rivian TPMs must be technically fluent in both software development and automotive manufacturing processes. RIVN RSUs provide growth-stage upside. [Source: Rivian TPM Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Rivian TPM = Google TPM L4-L5 = Tesla TPM = Amazon TPM = Apple TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Hardware-Software Program Complexity:** "Rivian programs span hardware (vehicle, manufacturing equipment) and software (vehicle OS, cloud services). This cross-domain coordination exceeds typical software-only TPM roles."
2. **Production Ramp Impact:** "My program management directly impacts Rivian's production ramp timeline. Program delays don't just affect product launches — they affect vehicle deliveries and quarterly revenue."
3. **Multi-Stakeholder Coordination:** "I coordinate across engineering, manufacturing, supply chain, regulatory, and commercial teams. The stakeholder complexity at an EV manufacturer exceeds typical tech companies."
4. **Growth-Stage TPM Premium:** "TPM at a growth-stage company means building program management processes while simultaneously running programs. This dual mandate commands a premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Rivian's program complexity spans vehicle software, manufacturing, supply chain, and fleet deployment. I'm targeting $220K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $190K. I have a Google TPM offer at $[X] and a competing offer from [Apple/Amazon] at $[Y]." Accept at $190K+ RSUs with base above $180K, plus a sign-on bonus.
