**Negotiation DNA**

Rivian Product Designers shape the entire customer experience — from the vehicle UI (infotainment, driver displays, ambient lighting) to the Rivian app to the purchase and service experience. Designing for an EV company means working across physical and digital interfaces: your designs appear on in-vehicle screens, in the mobile app, on the website, and in physical retail spaces. Rivian's design language — "adventure vehicle" identity with premium quality — must be consistently expressed across all touchpoints. The role requires expertise in automotive HMI design, mobile app design, and brand/visual design that goes beyond typical product design. RIVN RSUs provide growth-stage upside.

**Level Mapping:** Rivian Product Designer = Google UX Designer L3-L4 = Tesla Product Designer = Apple Design = Amazon UX Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Physical + Digital Design Scope:** "I design across physical (in-vehicle HMI, retail spaces) and digital (app, web, connected services) touchpoints. This cross-domain scope exceeds typical product design roles."
2. **Adventure Brand Identity:** "Rivian's adventure vehicle identity is a core brand differentiator. My design work defines how customers experience the brand — from the purchase journey to every interaction with the vehicle."
3. **Vehicle HMI Specialization:** "Automotive HMI design requires specialized expertise in driver safety, glanceability, and physical-digital integration that standard product designers don't have."
4. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a [Google/Apple] design offer at $[X]. Rivian's cross-domain design challenges are compelling, but comp needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Rivian's design challenges span vehicle HMI, mobile app, and brand experience — a uniquely broad scope. I'm targeting $170K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $172K. I have a Google design offer at $[X]." Accept at $150K+ RSUs with base above $165K, plus a sign-on bonus.
