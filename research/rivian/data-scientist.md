### Data Scientist | Rivian Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage EV Comp | Large Equity Grants (RIVN) | Mission-Driven Culture | EV Growth Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine (HQ) | $140K-$195K | $80K-$245K | 10% | $180K-$310K |
| Palo Alto | $148K-$205K | $90K-$260K | 10% | $195K-$325K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Rivian Data Scientists analyze vehicle performance, customer behavior, manufacturing quality, and market trends to drive decisions that shape Rivian's product and business strategy. You have access to a uniquely rich dataset: real-world vehicle telemetry from a growing fleet of EVs, combined with manufacturing, supply chain, and customer experience data. Your analyses directly inform product improvements (OTA updates that improve range, performance, or ride quality), manufacturing optimization (identifying quality issues before they scale), and business strategy (pricing, market expansion, fleet operations for Amazon). RIVN RSUs provide growth-stage upside. [Source: Rivian Data Science Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Rivian Data Scientist = Google DS L3-L4 = Amazon Applied Scientist = Tesla Data Scientist = Meta Data Scientist (IC3-IC4)

**Global Levers**

1. **Vehicle Performance Optimization:** "My analyses of vehicle telemetry directly drive OTA updates that improve range, performance, and battery longevity across the entire fleet. Every insight I uncover can be deployed to every Rivian on the road."
2. **Manufacturing Quality Analytics:** "I identify quality trends in manufacturing data before they become customer-facing issues. Early detection of quality signals saves millions in warranty costs and protects brand reputation."
3. **Growth-Stage Impact:** "At a growth-stage company, data science has an outsized impact — my analyses directly inform product strategy, pricing decisions, and market expansion priorities. I'm not one of 1,000 data scientists; I'm one of the first, with direct influence on company direction."
4. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a [Google/Meta] DS offer at $[X] with stable equity. Rivian's growth-stage access and impact are compelling, but the equity grant needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Rivian's data science challenges span vehicle performance, manufacturing quality, and business strategy — with access to a uniquely rich dataset. I'm targeting $220K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $190K. I have a Google DS offer at $[X] and a competing offer from [Meta/Netflix] at $[Y]." Accept at $190K+ RSUs with base above $180K, plus a sign-on bonus.
