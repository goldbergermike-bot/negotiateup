### EV Platform Engineer | Rivian Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage EV Comp | Large Equity Grants (RIVN) | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+10-15% EV PLATFORM PREMIUM** | Mission-Driven Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine (HQ) | $155K-$215K | $120K-$320K | 10% | $220K-$385K |
| Palo Alto | $160K-$220K | $130K-$340K | 10% | $230K-$400K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Rivian's signature engineering role. EV Platform Engineers build the software that defines Rivian's electric vehicle architecture — the battery management systems, motor control algorithms, vehicle networking, charging infrastructure integration, and over-the-air update platforms that make Rivian's R1T, R1S, and commercial delivery vans function. Rivian is one of only two pure-play EV manufacturers to successfully bring multiple vehicles to market (alongside Tesla), and the EV platform is the technology foundation that every vehicle depends on. The 10-15% platform premium reflects the scarcity of engineers who can build production-grade EV software — this requires embedded systems expertise, power electronics knowledge, and automotive safety certification experience that standard SWEs don't have. Rivian's $15B market cap and growth trajectory mean equity grants carry significant upside potential — but also meaningful volatility risk. Amazon's 20% ownership stake and the 100,000-unit commercial delivery van order provide a revenue floor, but RIVN stock has been volatile since IPO.

**Level Mapping:** Rivian EV Platform Engineer (Senior) = Tesla Vehicle Software Engineer = Lucid Powertrain Engineer = Google L4 Embedded = Waymo Vehicle SW Engineer

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The EV Platform Engineer at Rivian builds the software that defines the electric vehicle:
- **Full Vehicle Stack:** You work across battery management, motor control, thermal systems, and vehicle networking — the entire EV platform
- **Production at Scale:** Rivian has delivered 100K+ vehicles — your software runs on real vehicles on real roads
- **Amazon Commercial Fleet:** The 100K-unit Amazon delivery van order means your platform software powers a commercial fleet at scale
- **Adventure Vehicle DNA:** Rivian's vehicles are designed for off-road capability, which creates unique platform challenges (terrain adaptation, water fording, extreme conditions)
- **OTA Update Architecture:** Every software improvement ships to the entire fleet over-the-air — your impact compounds with every vehicle sold

**Global Levers**

1. **EV Platform Premium (10-15%):** "I'm building the software that defines Rivian's electric vehicle platform — battery management, motor control, vehicle networking. This requires specialized embedded systems and power electronics expertise that standard SWEs don't possess. The 10-15% platform premium reflects this talent scarcity."
2. **Production Scale Leverage:** "Rivian has delivered 100K+ vehicles and has a 100K-unit Amazon order. My platform software runs on a growing fleet of production vehicles — every improvement I make scales across the entire install base."
3. **RIVN Equity Upside:** "Rivian's stock has significant growth potential as production scales and margins improve. I want the RSU grant sized to capture this upside: $280K+ over 4 years. If RIVN performs, both Rivian and I win."
4. **Tesla/Lucid Competing Offer:** "I have a competing offer from [Tesla/Lucid/Waymo]. Each offers a different risk-reward profile. Rivian needs to size the equity grant competitively to win this talent decision."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Rivian's EV platform is the technology foundation for every vehicle you build — R1T, R1S, and the Amazon commercial fleet. I'm bringing [specific EV/embedded/powertrain expertise] that directly accelerates platform development. I'm targeting $300K in RSUs over 4 years with the EV Platform Premium, plus a base of $210K. I have a Tesla offer at $[X] total comp and a competing offer from [Lucid/Waymo] at $[Y]. Rivian's growth trajectory and adventure vehicle mission are compelling, but the equity grant needs to reflect both the platform premium and competing offers." Accept at $250K+ RSUs — this is the role where Rivian has the most equity flexibility because platform talent directly determines vehicle capability and production quality.
