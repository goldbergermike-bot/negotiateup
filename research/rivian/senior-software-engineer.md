| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Rivian own critical systems end-to-end and are expected to drive technical decisions across Rivian's vehicle, cloud, and manufacturing software. At this level, you set the architectural direction for systems that ship on real vehicles to real customers. Rivian's flat, startup-influenced culture means senior engineers often operate with scope that would require Staff titles at larger companies. The RSU grant becomes the dominant variable comp component at senior level, and Rivian typically offers large equity grants to retain senior talent in a competitive market. Rivian competes with Tesla, Google, Apple, and other Bay Area employers for senior SWEs, and the Palo Alto office is in the heart of this competition. [Source: Rivian Senior SWE Comp 2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Startup Scope at Scale:** "Rivian's flat org means I'll operate with Staff-level scope at FAANG companies. I'll own systems end-to-end with significant autonomy. The RSU grant should reflect the actual scope, not just the title."
2. **Multi-Platform System Ownership:** "I'll own systems that span consumer vehicles, commercial fleet, and connected services. At senior level, my architectural decisions impact the entire product portfolio."
3. **RIVN Equity Sizing for Retention:** "At the senior level, equity is the primary comp lever. I need the RSU grant sized at $280K+ over 4 years — a retention-grade grant that keeps me engaged through the full vesting period."
4. **Bay Area Talent Competition:** "In the Palo Alto office, I'm forgoing Google L4 and Tesla Senior SWE offers. Rivian's equity grant needs to be competitive on a risk-adjusted total comp basis."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "At the Senior level, I'll own critical systems with impact across Rivian's entire product portfolio. I'm targeting $280K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $210K. I have a Google L4 offer at $[X] and a Tesla Senior SWE offer at $[Y]. Rivian's growth trajectory is compelling, but the equity grant needs to compensate for RIVN stock risk relative to GOOGL or TSLA." Accept at $240K+ RSUs with base above $200K, plus a sign-on bonus.
