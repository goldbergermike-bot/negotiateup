**Negotiation DNA**

Rivian Data Engineers build the data infrastructure that connects vehicle telemetry, manufacturing operations, supply chain logistics, and customer experience into a unified data platform. Every Rivian vehicle generates continuous streams of telemetry data — battery health, motor performance, driving patterns, charging behavior — and your pipelines transform this raw data into actionable insights that improve vehicle quality, optimize manufacturing, and enhance the customer experience. Rivian's data infrastructure must handle the dual complexity of automotive data (real-time, high-frequency, safety-relevant) and business data (supply chain, sales, service). RIVN RSUs provide growth-stage upside with a 10% target bonus. [Source: Rivian Data Engineering Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Rivian Data Engineer = Google Data Engineer L3-L4 = Amazon Data Engineer II = Tesla Data Engineer = Meta Data Engineer (IC3-IC4)

**Global Levers**

1. **Vehicle Telemetry at Scale:** "Rivian's data infrastructure processes continuous telemetry from a growing fleet of vehicles — battery health, motor performance, driving patterns, and charging behavior. This is automotive-grade data engineering with real-time processing requirements that go beyond standard ETL."
2. **Manufacturing Data Integration:** "My pipelines connect vehicle data with manufacturing operations and supply chain systems. Improving data flow between these domains directly impacts production quality and efficiency — measurable cost savings."
3. **Growth-Stage Equity Upside:** "RIVN at $15B market cap has significant growth potential as production scales. My RSU grant should be sized to capture this upside: $200K+ over 4 years."
4. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a [Google/Amazon] data engineering offer at $[X] with stable equity. Rivian's growth upside is compelling, but the equity grant needs to compensate for RIVN stock volatility."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Rivian's data infrastructure is critical to vehicle quality, manufacturing efficiency, and customer experience. I'm targeting $210K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $185K. I have a Google Data Engineer offer at $[X] and a competing offer from [Databricks/Snowflake] at $[Y]." Accept at $180K+ RSUs with base above $175K, plus a sign-on bonus.
