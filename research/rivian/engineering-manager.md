### Engineering Manager | Rivian Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage EV Comp | Large Equity Grants (RIVN) | Mission-Driven Culture | EV Growth Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine (HQ) | $175K-$235K | $150K-$380K | 10% | $260K-$430K |
| Palo Alto | $183K-$245K | $165K-$400K | 10% | $275K-$450K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Rivian Engineering Managers lead teams building the software that powers electric vehicles, connected services, manufacturing automation, and the Amazon commercial fleet. Leading engineering at a growth-stage EV manufacturer is uniquely challenging — you're building teams and processes while simultaneously shipping production software for vehicles on the road. Rivian EMs must be technically deep enough to guide vehicle software and cloud architecture decisions while building engineering culture during a period of rapid growth. The equity component at EM level is substantial, reflecting Rivian's need to attract and retain management talent from Google, Apple, Tesla, and other Bay Area employers. RIVN RSUs provide growth-stage upside. [Source: Rivian EM Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Rivian Engineering Manager = Google EM L5 = Meta M1 = Tesla EM = Apple EM2 = Amazon SDM II

**Global Levers**

1. **Team Building at Scale:** "I'll build and lead engineering teams during Rivian's most critical scaling phase. Recruiting EV talent in a competitive market, establishing engineering practices, and growing the team from startup culture to production maturity — this is organizational leadership that shapes the company's trajectory."
2. **Growth-Stage EM Premium:** "Leading engineering at a growth-stage company requires building infrastructure and culture simultaneously. I'm not inheriting a mature org — I'm building it. This foundational work commands a premium."
3. **Multi-Domain Technical Leadership:** "My teams will span vehicle software, cloud services, manufacturing automation, and fleet operations. This technical breadth exceeds typical single-domain EM roles."
4. **FAANG EM Alternative:** "I have an EM offer from [Google/Apple/Amazon] at $[X] with stable equity. Rivian's growth upside and mission are compelling, but the equity grant must make the risk-adjusted comparison favorable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Leading engineering at Rivian during the scaling phase is a defining career opportunity. I'm targeting $350K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $230K. I have a Google EM offer at $[X] and a competing EM offer from [Tesla/Apple] at $[Y]. Rivian's growth trajectory and mission are my top choice, but equity must compensate for growth-stage risk." Accept at $300K+ RSUs with base above $215K.
