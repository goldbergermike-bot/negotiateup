### ML/AI Engineer | Rivian Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage EV Comp | Large Equity Grants (RIVN) | Mission-Driven Culture | **+5-10% ML PREMIUM** | EV Growth Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Irvine (HQ) | $150K-$210K | $95K-$275K | 10% | $200K-$340K |
| Palo Alto | $158K-$220K | $105K-$290K | 10% | $215K-$360K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Rivian ML/AI Engineers build the machine learning models that power ADAS features, battery optimization, predictive maintenance, manufacturing quality, and personalized vehicle experiences. ML at Rivian operates at the intersection of software and the physical world — your models must work reliably on real vehicles in real driving conditions. Applications span computer vision for driver assistance, predictive models for battery degradation, anomaly detection in manufacturing, and recommendation systems for charging optimization. The 5-10% ML premium reflects the scarcity of ML engineers who understand both deep learning and automotive/embedded constraints. RIVN RSUs provide growth-stage upside.

**Level Mapping:** Rivian ML/AI Engineer = Google ML Engineer L3-L4 = Tesla ML Engineer = Amazon Applied Scientist = Meta ML Engineer (IC3-IC4)

**Global Levers**

1. **Physical-World ML Premium:** "My ML models operate on real vehicles in the real world — not just serving recommendations or ranking search results. Physical-world ML requires a level of reliability, safety validation, and embedded optimization that web-scale ML does not."
2. **Battery + ADAS ML Expertise:** "I build models that optimize battery performance and power ADAS features. This requires domain expertise in electrochemistry, sensor fusion, and automotive safety — a rare combination of ML and physical-world knowledge."
3. **Fleet-Scale Learning:** "As Rivian's fleet grows, my models improve with more data. Every vehicle on the road contributes to the training dataset, creating a data flywheel that makes each subsequent model better."
4. **ML Talent Competition:** "I have a [Google Brain/Meta AI/Tesla] ML offer at $[X]. Rivian's applied ML challenges are uniquely compelling, but comp needs to reflect ML market rates."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Rivian's ML challenges span ADAS, battery optimization, and manufacturing quality — applied ML with real-world impact. I'm targeting $250K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $205K. I have a Google ML offer at $[X] and a Tesla ML offer at $[Y]. Rivian's growth trajectory and the breadth of ML applications are compelling." Accept at $210K+ RSUs with base above $195K, plus a sign-on bonus.
