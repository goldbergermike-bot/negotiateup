**Negotiation DNA**

Rivian DevOps Engineers build and maintain the infrastructure that supports vehicle software development, cloud-connected vehicle services, manufacturing automation, and fleet operations. This is DevOps for a company that bridges automotive manufacturing and Silicon Valley software — your infrastructure serves vehicle OTA update pipelines, real-time telemetry processing, factory automation systems, and customer-facing applications. Rivian's rapid scaling from startup to production manufacturer means infrastructure must evolve quickly while maintaining the reliability required for vehicle-related services. RIVN RSUs provide growth-stage upside with a 10% target bonus. [Source: Rivian DevOps Comp 2026]
