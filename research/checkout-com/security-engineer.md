#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £85,000–£130,000 | £45,000–£95,000 | £130,000–£225,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $175,000–$235,000 | $80,000–$140,000 | $255,000–$375,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $170,000–$230,000 | $75,000–$135,000 | $245,000–$365,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers at Checkout.com protect one of the most valuable and heavily targeted platforms in fintech — a platform that is now expanding into AI-Native Shopping Rails and stablecoin settlement. With the $12B internal valuation and the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition creating entirely new attack surfaces, Security Engineers must secure not just traditional payment flows but also AI agent transaction APIs, stablecoin settlement infrastructure, and the programmable money layer. This is not standard payment security — it is securing the convergence of AI commerce, traditional payments, and blockchain-adjacent stablecoin systems for enterprise clients like Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony. The intersection of AI security, payment security, and stablecoin/blockchain security is an extremely narrow and premium talent pool. Total comp of $340K–$375K+ is defensible in US metros.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Checkout.com | Stripe | Adyen | PPRO | Google | Meta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | L4 Security Eng | IC4 Security Eng |
| Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Eng | Senior Security Eng | Senior Security Eng | L5 Security Eng | IC5 Security Eng |
| Staff Security Engineer | Staff Security Eng | Lead Security Eng | Lead Security Eng | L6 Security Eng | IC6 Security Eng |

Checkout.com Security bands map to Stripe Security Engineer ($300K–$420K TC in SF) and Google L4–L5 Security ($290K–$440K TC). Adyen Security Engineers in Amsterdam earn 20–30% below SF benchmarks. PPRO Security roles pay 15–25% below Checkout.com in London. The Agentic Commerce security mandate — securing AI agent APIs, stablecoin settlement systems, and autonomous transaction flows — adds security scope that standard payment security roles lack.

#### 🤖 Checkout.com Agentic Commerce & AI-Native Shopping Rails Lever

The $12B internal valuation positions Checkout.com as a platform that must protect both traditional payment infrastructure and an emerging AI commerce layer. The January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition adds stablecoin settlement security — a domain where a security breach could mean irreversible loss of funds, unlike traditional card payments which have chargeback protections.

For Security Engineers, the Agentic Commerce vision introduces three new threat surfaces that must be secured simultaneously. First, AI agent authentication and authorization — ensuring that only legitimate AI agents can initiate transactions through Checkout.com's APIs, and that compromised AI agents cannot be weaponized for financial fraud. Second, stablecoin settlement security — protecting the Blue EMI stablecoin infrastructure against smart contract exploits, settlement manipulation, and blockchain-specific attack vectors. Third, autonomous transaction fraud — detecting fraudulent patterns in machine-initiated transactions that look fundamentally different from human-initiated fraud.

Security Engineers who can protect across all three of these surfaces — traditional payments, AI agent APIs, and stablecoin infrastructure — possess a skill set that is nearly unique in the industry. The $12B valuation offers favorable option economics, and the company's dependence on security to protect its Agentic Commerce ambitions gives Security Engineers significant leverage in compensation negotiations.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — AI Agent Security Architecture:** > "Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails will be targeted by adversaries attempting to compromise AI agents for financial fraud. I'll be designing the authentication, authorization, and anomaly detection systems that secure AI agent transactions. This is a new security discipline — protecting machine-to-machine payment APIs against AI-specific attack vectors. Security Engineers pioneering AI commerce security command premium compensation."

**Lever 2 — Blue EMI Stablecoin Security:** > "The January 2026 Blue EMI acquisition introduces stablecoin settlement infrastructure where security breaches can mean irreversible loss of funds. I'll be securing blockchain-adjacent systems, settlement flows, and programmable money infrastructure. This is fundamentally higher-stakes than traditional card payment security, where chargebacks provide a safety net. Stablecoin security expertise commands a significant premium."

**Lever 3 — Enterprise Trust at Scale:** > "Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony trust Checkout.com with billions in payment transactions. A security breach doesn't just affect Checkout.com — it destroys billion-dollar enterprise relationships. In the Agentic Commerce era, the attack surface expands to AI agent APIs and stablecoin settlement. The Security Engineer protecting this expanded surface carries responsibility commensurate with the $12B valuation."

**Lever 4 — $12B Valuation Options for Security Talent:** > "Security engineers are in extreme demand across fintech, banking, and crypto. My competing offers include $350K–$400K+ in liquid total comp at public companies. Checkout.com's options at the $12B valuation carry illiquidity risk, but the Agentic Commerce thesis and Blue EMI integration provide clear catalysts. I need the option grant at $125K+/yr annualized to make the risk-adjusted math work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $375K total comp ($235K base + $140K options/yr) for San Francisco. Frame yourself as an "AI Commerce and Stablecoin Security Architect" — the person securing Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails, Blue EMI stablecoin infrastructure, and traditional payment platform simultaneously. Benchmark against Stripe Senior Security ($340K–$420K TC) and Google L5 Security ($350K–$440K TC). Emphasize the triple-surface security mandate — traditional payments, AI agent APIs, and stablecoin infrastructure — as justification for top-of-band compensation. Push options to $140K/yr annualized at the $12B valuation. If countered below $310K TC, demand a $30K sign-on bonus and a security-certification bonus ($10K for CISSP, CISM, OSCP). Accept-at floor: $255K TC with options at $80K+/yr.
