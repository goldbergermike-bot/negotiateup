### Engineering Manager — Checkout.com Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Checkout.com's Agentic Commerce strategy, translating the $12B valuation and Jan 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition into an engineering management compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £110,000–£155,000 | £70,000–£140,000 | £180,000–£295,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $210,000–$270,000 | $110,000–$190,000 | $320,000–$460,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $200,000–$260,000 | $100,000–$180,000 | $300,000–$440,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering Managers at Checkout.com are leading the teams building AI-Native Shopping Rails — the payment infrastructure that AI agents will use for autonomous commerce. With the $12B internal valuation and the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition creating entirely new engineering mandates, EMs are responsible for hiring, organizing, and delivering across payment processing, stablecoin settlement, and AI-optimized API layers simultaneously. This is not standard team management — it is standing up engineering organizations capable of building regulated financial infrastructure for a new category of machine-driven commerce. The complexity of managing across payment compliance, stablecoin integration, and AI-native design patterns justifies total comp of $400K–$460K+ in US metro markets, benchmarked against Stripe, Google, and legacy acquirer EM roles.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Checkout.com | Stripe | Adyen | PPRO | Google | Meta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engineering Manager | EM (M1) | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | M1 | M1 |
| Senior Engineering Manager | Senior EM (M2) | Senior EM | Senior EM | M2 | M2 |

Checkout.com's EM band maps to Stripe M1 ($350K–$500K TC in SF) and Google M1 ($350K–$480K TC). Adyen EMs in Amsterdam typically earn 20–30% below SF benchmarks but receive competitive equity. PPRO's EM roles pay 15–25% below Checkout.com in London. The Agentic Commerce mandate adds complexity that justifies compensation at the upper end of these ranges.

#### 🤖 Checkout.com Agentic Commerce & AI-Native Shopping Rails Lever

The $12B internal valuation positions Checkout.com as the premium enterprise payment processor, and the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition signals a company that is moving faster than its competitors. For Engineering Managers, the Agentic Commerce vision creates a unique leadership challenge: building and retaining engineering teams capable of delivering AI-Native Shopping Rails while simultaneously integrating stablecoin settlement infrastructure.

This is a multi-dimensional management challenge. EMs must recruit engineers with payment systems expertise and upskill them on AI-native API design. They must integrate the Blue EMI stablecoin technology stack into existing payment rails, requiring teams that span blockchain engineering, compliance, and traditional payment processing. They must maintain the enterprise reliability standards that Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony depend on while shipping new Agentic Commerce capabilities at startup velocity. And they must do all of this in a private-company environment where option-based compensation requires constant storytelling about the upside potential of the $12B valuation re-rating as Agentic Commerce gains traction.

EMs who can manage across these dimensions — payments, stablecoins, AI, compliance, and enterprise reliability — are among the rarest leaders in fintech. Their compensation should reflect that scarcity.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Agentic Commerce Org Building:** > "I'll be building the engineering organization that delivers Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails. Recruiting and retaining engineers who can work across payment processing, stablecoin settlement, and AI-native API design requires offering competitive comp — which means the EM leading these teams needs to be compensated at or above the market rate for the talent they're hiring. You can't hire $350K engineers with a $300K manager."

**Lever 2 — $12B Valuation Talent Retention Mandate:** > "At a $12B private valuation with options-based compensation, retention is an EM's most critical challenge. I need to be compensated at a level where I can credibly advocate for the company's equity story to my team. If my own option grant isn't compelling, I can't authentically retain engineers who have liquid RSU offers from public companies."

**Lever 3 — Blue EMI Stablecoin Team Integration:** > "The January 2026 Blue EMI acquisition means I'll be integrating a stablecoin technology team into Checkout.com's existing engineering organization. Post-acquisition team integration is one of the hardest management challenges — it requires cultural sensitivity, technical alignment, and organizational redesign. EMs with M&A integration experience command a premium, and the Blue EMI integration adds the complexity of stablecoin-native engineering culture."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise Reliability Leadership:** > "Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony depend on the systems my teams build. In the Agentic Commerce era, where AI agents transact autonomously at machine speed, reliability failures cascade exponentially. The EM responsible for this reliability carries enterprise-critical accountability and should be compensated at the top of band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $460K total comp ($270K base + $190K options/yr) for San Francisco. Frame the role as building the engineering organization for Agentic Commerce — not managing a static team. Cite $400K–$500K TC at Stripe M1 and Google M1 as direct comparables. Emphasize the Blue EMI stablecoin integration as an M&A management challenge that adds scope beyond typical EM roles. Push for option grants sized at a premium to reflect the org-building mandate. If countered below $380K TC, negotiate for a sign-on bonus of $40K–$60K and a commitment to re-level to Senior EM within 12 months. Accept-at floor: $320K TC with options annualized at minimum $110K/yr — below this, public-company EM roles with liquid equity and established teams are the safer choice.
