#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £90,000–£135,000 | £50,000–£100,000 | £140,000–£235,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $180,000–$240,000 | $80,000–$145,000 | $260,000–$385,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $175,000–$235,000 | $75,000–$140,000 | $250,000–$375,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Technical Program Managers at Checkout.com are the connective tissue of the Agentic Commerce transformation. With the $12B internal valuation and the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition creating multiple parallel delivery tracks — AI-Native Shopping Rails, stablecoin settlement integration, and enterprise merchant enablement — TPMs are orchestrating the most complex cross-functional program in the company's history. This is not standard product launch TPM work — it is managing the convergence of AI agent APIs, programmable money infrastructure, payment processing, and enterprise compliance into a unified platform. TPMs who can orchestrate across these dimensions while maintaining delivery velocity for enterprise clients like Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony are in extremely short supply. Total comp of $340K–$385K+ is justified in US metros.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Checkout.com | Stripe | Adyen | PPRO | Google | Meta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Technical Program Manager | TPM | Technical PM | Project Manager | L5 TPM | IC5 TPM |
| Senior TPM | Senior TPM | Senior Technical PM | Senior PM | L6 TPM | IC6 TPM |
| Staff TPM | Staff TPM | Lead Technical PM | Lead PM | L7 TPM | D1 TPM |

Checkout.com TPM bands map to Stripe TPM ($300K–$440K TC in SF) and Google L5–L6 TPM ($320K–$500K TC). Adyen Technical PMs in Amsterdam earn 15–25% below SF benchmarks. PPRO PMs are 20–30% below Checkout.com in London. The Agentic Commerce program mandate — coordinating AI agent platform, stablecoin integration, and enterprise enablement simultaneously — adds program complexity that standard payment TPM roles do not carry.

#### 🤖 Checkout.com Agentic Commerce & AI-Native Shopping Rails Lever

The $12B internal valuation reflects Checkout.com's commitment to becoming the payment infrastructure for AI-initiated commerce. The January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition adds an entirely new program track that must be coordinated with the existing AI-Native Shopping Rails build and enterprise merchant enablement.

For TPMs, the Agentic Commerce vision creates a program management challenge of exceptional complexity. You are orchestrating the simultaneous delivery of AI agent transaction APIs (engineering), stablecoin settlement infrastructure integration from the Blue EMI acquisition (engineering + compliance), enterprise merchant Agentic Commerce enablement (product + solutions architecture + sales), regulatory compliance for both AI-initiated transactions and stablecoin payments (legal + compliance), and platform reliability at enterprise scale for clients like Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony (SRE + infrastructure).

Each of these workstreams has its own dependencies, risk profiles, and stakeholder sets. The TPM must create a unified program plan that delivers Agentic Commerce capabilities while integrating Blue EMI stablecoin infrastructure, all without disrupting existing payment processing for enterprise clients. This is program management at the level of a company-defining transformation, and the compensation should reflect that scope. The $12B valuation and favorable option economics mean TPMs joining now are well-positioned for significant upside if the Agentic Commerce program delivers.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Multi-Track Agentic Commerce Program Leadership:** > "I'll be managing the delivery of Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails — a program that spans AI agent APIs, stablecoin settlement integration, enterprise enablement, and regulatory compliance. This is at least four major program tracks that must converge into a unified platform. TPMs managing programs of this scope at a $12B company command top-of-band compensation."

**Lever 2 — Blue EMI Integration Program Management:** > "The January 2026 Blue EMI acquisition needs to be integrated into Checkout.com's payment platform — technology, processes, team, and compliance. Post-acquisition integration is one of the hardest TPM challenges, and the Blue EMI integration adds the complexity of stablecoin infrastructure. I need compensation that reflects M&A integration program management expertise on top of standard TPM bands."

**Lever 3 — Enterprise Delivery Stakes:** > "Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony are waiting for Agentic Commerce capabilities. Every missed milestone costs enterprise revenue. The TPM ensuring on-time delivery of AI-Native Shopping Rails is directly protecting and expanding these billion-dollar enterprise relationships. My compensation should scale with the revenue implications of my program's delivery timeline."

**Lever 4 — $12B Valuation Options for Transformation Leaders:** > "I'm committing to a multi-year transformation program at a private company. The $12B valuation offers favorable option economics, but I need the grant sized at $130K+/yr annualized to compensate for the illiquidity risk and the career concentration of spending years on Checkout.com's Agentic Commerce program. If the program succeeds, the re-rating potential is significant — my option grant should reflect my role in making that re-rating happen."
