### DevOps Engineer — Checkout.com Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Checkout.com's Agentic Commerce strategy, translating the $12B valuation and Jan 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition into a DevOps engineering compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £75,000–£115,000 | £35,000–£80,000 | £110,000–£195,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $155,000–$215,000 | $65,000–$120,000 | $220,000–$335,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $150,000–$210,000 | $60,000–$115,000 | $210,000–$325,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: DevOps Engineers at Checkout.com are responsible for the infrastructure that keeps AI-Native Shopping Rails running at enterprise scale. With the $12B internal valuation and the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition adding stablecoin settlement infrastructure to the platform, DevOps Engineers must operate payment processing systems, AI agent transaction APIs, and blockchain-adjacent stablecoin nodes simultaneously. This is not standard cloud operations — it is maintaining the infrastructure backbone for Agentic Commerce, where AI agents transact autonomously at machine speed and any latency or downtime directly impacts enterprise clients like Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony. The intersection of payment infrastructure operations, AI-native API reliability, and stablecoin settlement systems is a rare DevOps specialization. Total comp of $300K–$335K+ is defensible in US metros.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Checkout.com | Stripe | Adyen | PPRO | Google | Meta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DevOps Engineer | Infrastructure Engineer | DevOps Engineer | DevOps Engineer | L4 SRE | IC4 Prod Eng |
| Senior DevOps Engineer | Senior Infra Engineer | Senior DevOps | Senior DevOps | L5 SRE | IC5 Prod Eng |
| Staff DevOps Engineer | Staff Infra Engineer | Lead DevOps | Lead DevOps | L6 SRE | IC6 Prod Eng |

Checkout.com DevOps bands map to Stripe Infrastructure Engineer ($280K–$400K TC in SF) and Google L4–L5 SRE ($290K–$430K TC). Adyen DevOps in Amsterdam earn 20–30% below SF benchmarks. PPRO DevOps roles pay 15–25% below Checkout.com in London. The Agentic Commerce infrastructure mandate adds operational complexity — managing AI agent API traffic patterns and stablecoin node infrastructure — that standard payment processor DevOps roles lack.

#### 🤖 Checkout.com Agentic Commerce & AI-Native Shopping Rails Lever

The $12B internal valuation positions Checkout.com as a company investing heavily in becoming the infrastructure layer for AI-initiated commerce. The January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition adds stablecoin settlement nodes and blockchain-adjacent infrastructure to the DevOps scope — a fundamentally new infrastructure category that must be integrated with existing payment processing systems.

For DevOps Engineers, the Agentic Commerce vision transforms the operational mandate. Traditional payment infrastructure handles human-initiated transactions with predictable traffic patterns. AI-Native Shopping Rails handle machine-initiated transactions at machine speed — thousands of concurrent AI agents autonomously purchasing across enterprise merchant platforms, creating traffic patterns that are faster, more bursty, and less predictable than human shopping behavior. DevOps Engineers must design infrastructure that scales dynamically to handle AI agent traffic spikes, maintains sub-100ms latency for machine-to-machine payment API calls, and provides the observability needed to distinguish between legitimate AI agent transaction storms and DDoS attacks.

The Blue EMI stablecoin infrastructure adds another operational dimension: running and maintaining the settlement nodes, managing blockchain-adjacent systems, and ensuring that stablecoin settlement is as reliable as traditional card settlement. DevOps Engineers who can operate across traditional payments, AI agent APIs, and stablecoin infrastructure are building an exceptionally rare skill set. The $12B valuation offers favorable option economics for those joining at this infrastructure inflection point.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — AI Agent Traffic Infrastructure:** > "Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails will generate machine-speed transaction traffic — thousands of AI agents transacting simultaneously with patterns fundamentally different from human shopping behavior. I'll be building infrastructure that scales to handle this new traffic paradigm while maintaining sub-100ms latency. DevOps Engineers who can design infrastructure for AI agent traffic patterns command a premium because this is a new operational discipline."

**Lever 2 — Blue EMI Stablecoin Infrastructure Operations:** > "The January 2026 Blue EMI acquisition adds stablecoin settlement infrastructure to my operational scope. I'll be running blockchain-adjacent systems alongside traditional payment infrastructure — a dual-modality operations challenge that no major payment processor has solved at enterprise scale. This stablecoin infrastructure expertise is worth a 15–20% premium over standard payment DevOps roles."

**Lever 3 — Enterprise Uptime Revenue Correlation:** > "Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony depend on infrastructure uptime for their payment processing. In the Agentic Commerce era, where AI agents transact autonomously, a minute of downtime doesn't just affect a few checkout flows — it interrupts thousands of concurrent AI agent transactions. The DevOps Engineer maintaining this uptime is protecting the company's $12B valuation and enterprise revenue relationships."

**Lever 4 — $12B Valuation Options for Infrastructure Builders:** > "Infrastructure engineers building the operational foundation for AI-Native Shopping Rails are creating systems that will serve Checkout.com for years. At the $12B valuation, option grants are struck at a favorable price. I need $100K+/yr annualized in options to compensate for the illiquidity risk versus liquid RSU offers from public companies competing for the same DevOps talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $335K total comp ($215K base + $120K options/yr) for San Francisco. Frame the role as "Agentic Commerce infrastructure engineer" — the person ensuring AI-Native Shopping Rails run at enterprise scale. Benchmark against Stripe Senior Infrastructure ($320K–$400K TC) and Google L5 SRE ($340K–$430K TC). Emphasize the Blue EMI stablecoin infrastructure as an operational scope expansion that adds a 15–20% complexity premium. Push options to $120K/yr annualized at the $12B valuation. If countered below $275K TC, negotiate a $25K sign-on and an on-call compensation premium ($15K–$20K/yr). Accept-at floor: $220K TC with options at $65K+/yr annualized.
