### Software Engineer — Checkout.com Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Checkout.com's Agentic Commerce strategy, translating the $12B valuation and Jan 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition into a software engineering compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £65,000–£95,000 | £30,000–£65,000 | £95,000–£160,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $130,000–$170,000 | $50,000–$95,000 | $180,000–$265,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $125,000–$165,000 | $45,000–$90,000 | $170,000–$255,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Checkout.com is no longer just a payment processor — it is building the AI-Native Shopping Rails that will power Agentic Commerce across every major enterprise merchant. The January 2026 acquisition of Blue EMI, securing a European EMI license for stablecoin-powered payments, signals a company moving aggressively into programmable money infrastructure. Combined with the $12B internal valuation that marks confidence in its trajectory, Software Engineers joining Checkout.com today are building the foundational transaction layer that AI agents will use to autonomously initiate, validate, and complete purchases. This is not generic API work; it is the creation of machine-to-machine payment rails. Total comp packages of $200K+ are defensible at this level given the Agentic Commerce mandate and the scarcity of engineers who can build payment systems designed for autonomous AI consumption.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Checkout.com | Stripe | Adyen | PPRO | Google | Meta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Software Engineer (IC2) | L1 | Software Engineer | Engineer | L3 | E3 |
| Software Engineer (IC3) | L2 | Software Engineer II | Senior Engineer | L4 | E4 |

Checkout.com's IC2–IC3 bands map to Stripe L1–L2 and Adyen's first two engineering tiers. PPRO's equivalent roles typically pay 10–20% below Checkout.com in London, reflecting Checkout.com's premium positioning as the enterprise-grade processor of choice. When benchmarking, always compare against Stripe's liquid RSU packages and argue that Checkout.com's option illiquidity requires a grant premium of 20–30% to achieve parity on a risk-adjusted basis.

#### 🤖 Checkout.com Agentic Commerce & AI-Native Shopping Rails Lever

Checkout.com's $12B internal valuation is not a static number — it is a forward bet on the company's position as the dominant payment processor for the AI commerce era. The January 2026 acquisition of Blue EMI, which secured a European Electronic Money Institution license for stablecoin-powered payments, is the clearest signal yet that Checkout.com is building payment infrastructure designed for machines, not just humans.

The Agentic Commerce vision is straightforward: within 2–3 years, a significant percentage of online transactions will be initiated by AI agents — shopping assistants, procurement bots, subscription managers — that autonomously select products, negotiate prices, and complete payments without human intervention. These AI agents need payment rails that are API-first, deterministic, low-latency, and capable of handling programmable money (including stablecoins). Checkout.com is positioning itself as the default transaction layer for this new paradigm.

For a Software Engineer, this means your code is not powering checkout buttons — it is powering the autonomous transaction infrastructure that AI agents across every major enterprise will depend on. The systems you build must handle machine-speed transaction volumes, stablecoin settlement, and the compliance requirements that come with programmable money. This positions you at the intersection of payments, AI, and crypto infrastructure — a combination that commands a significant premium in the 2026 talent market.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — AI-Native Shopping Rails Scarcity:** > "Checkout.com is building payment infrastructure specifically designed for AI agent consumption — AI-Native Shopping Rails. Engineers who can build API-first, machine-to-machine payment systems that handle stablecoin settlement and autonomous transaction flows are exceptionally scarce. My compensation should reflect the AI-commerce infrastructure talent market, not the legacy fintech market."

**Lever 2 — $12B Valuation & Options at an Inflection Point:** > "Checkout.com's $12B internal valuation reflects confidence in the Agentic Commerce trajectory, but it's still well below the $40B peak. My option strike price is set at a historically favorable point. I need the option grant sized generously enough that the upside compensates for the illiquidity risk I'm taking versus liquid RSUs at a public company like Stripe or Adyen."

**Lever 3 — Blue EMI Stablecoin Infrastructure:** > "The January 2026 Blue EMI acquisition gives Checkout.com a European EMI license for stablecoin-powered payments. This is an entirely new payment modality that requires engineers who understand both traditional payment rails and programmable money. I'm joining at the moment this capability is being built from scratch — that greenfield complexity justifies a premium."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise Client Stakes in the AI Era:** > "Checkout.com processes payments for Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony. As these enterprises deploy AI shopping agents, they need a payment processor whose infrastructure can handle autonomous, machine-initiated transactions at scale. The engineer building these AI-Native Shopping Rails carries enterprise-grade responsibility and should be compensated accordingly."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $265K total comp ($170K base + $95K options/yr) for San Francisco. Anchor on the AI-Native Shopping Rails build and the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition as the inflection point that elevates this role from "fintech engineer" to "AI commerce infrastructure engineer." Emphasize that Agentic Commerce infrastructure engineering commands a 15–25% premium over standard payment processing roles. If they counter below $220K TC, push back on option grant size — argue that the $12B valuation still represents a discount to peak and the company should grant generously at this strike price. Accept-at floor: $180K TC with a meaningful option grant (minimum $50K/yr annualized) — anything below that and a public-company offer with liquid RSUs is strictly superior.
