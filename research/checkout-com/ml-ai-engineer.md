#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £95,000–£145,000 | £55,000–£120,000 | £150,000–£265,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $185,000–$250,000 | $90,000–$170,000 | $275,000–$420,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $180,000–$245,000 | $85,000–$165,000 | $265,000–$410,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers at Checkout.com are the architects of the intelligence layer powering AI-Native Shopping Rails. With the $12B internal valuation and the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition, ML/AI Engineers are building the models that determine how AI agents interact with payment infrastructure — real-time fraud detection for autonomous transactions, authorization optimization for machine-initiated payments, intelligent routing across traditional and stablecoin settlement paths, and the agent behavior models that distinguish legitimate AI commerce from adversarial exploitation. This is not standard fintech ML — it is building the brains of Agentic Commerce, where every model prediction directly affects whether an AI agent's transaction succeeds or fails across enterprise clients like Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony. Total comp of $380K–$420K+ is defensible for experienced ML/AI Engineers in US metros, reflecting both the AI talent premium and the payment domain expertise requirement.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Checkout.com | Stripe | Adyen | PPRO | Google | Meta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ML/AI Engineer | ML Engineer | ML Engineer | Data Scientist | L4 ML Eng | IC4 ML Eng |
| Senior ML/AI Engineer | Senior ML Eng | Senior ML Eng | Senior DS | L5 ML Eng | IC5 ML Eng |
| Staff ML/AI Engineer | Staff ML Eng | Lead ML Eng | Lead DS | L6 Research Sci | IC6 ML Eng |

Checkout.com ML/AI bands map to Stripe ML Engineer ($350K–$500K TC in SF) and Google L4–L5 ML ($330K–$480K TC). Adyen ML Engineers in Amsterdam earn 20–30% below SF benchmarks. PPRO's equivalent DS roles pay 25–35% below Checkout.com in London. The Agentic Commerce ML mandate — AI agent behavior modeling, autonomous transaction fraud detection, and stablecoin routing optimization — exceeds the scope of standard payment ML roles and competes with pure-play AI company compensation.

#### 🤖 Checkout.com Agentic Commerce & AI-Native Shopping Rails Lever

Checkout.com's $12B internal valuation is fundamentally a bet on AI-powered payment infrastructure. The January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition adds stablecoin settlement as a new routing option that ML models must optimize. For ML/AI Engineers, the Agentic Commerce thesis means building the most consequential ML systems in the payment industry.

The ML challenges in AI-Native Shopping Rails are unlike anything in traditional payment processing. First, AI agent behavior modeling: when AI agents are the transactors, the ML systems must learn the behavioral signatures of legitimate AI agents versus compromised or adversarial ones — a fundamentally different feature space than human cardholder behavior. Second, multi-modality routing optimization: with the Blue EMI stablecoin integration, ML models must now optimize transaction routing across traditional card networks AND stablecoin settlement paths, considering cost, speed, regulatory constraints, and counterparty risk. Third, autonomous transaction fraud detection: machine-initiated transactions at machine speed require fraud models that operate at lower latency with different feature sets than human-initiated transaction fraud. Fourth, dynamic pricing intelligence: AI agents negotiating prices in real-time create a new optimization surface for payment processing economics.

The $12B valuation creates favorable option economics for ML/AI Engineers, who are among the most competed-for hires in the technology industry. If Checkout.com's Agentic Commerce thesis succeeds — becoming the default ML-powered payment infrastructure for AI-initiated transactions — the re-rating potential from $12B toward and beyond the $40B peak is substantial. ML/AI Engineers building the intelligence layer that drives this outcome should negotiate option grants that reflect their direct influence over the company's most important strategic initiative.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Agentic Commerce ML Architecture:** > "I'll be building the ML systems that power AI-Native Shopping Rails — AI agent behavior modeling, autonomous transaction fraud detection, and multi-modality routing optimization across traditional and stablecoin settlement. This is the most strategically important ML work at Checkout.com, and the engineer who defines the Agentic Commerce ML architecture is directly influencing whether the company captures the AI commerce market. My compensation should reflect that strategic importance."

**Lever 2 — Blue EMI Stablecoin Routing Intelligence:** > "The January 2026 Blue EMI acquisition adds stablecoin settlement as a routing option that my ML models must optimize. Building ML systems that dynamically route transactions between traditional card networks and stablecoin settlement based on cost, speed, and regulatory constraints is unprecedented at enterprise scale. This multi-modality routing intelligence is a competitive advantage that no other payment processor currently has."

**Lever 3 — Revenue Impact at Basis-Point Scale:** > "Every basis point of authorization rate improvement or fraud detection accuracy translates to millions in revenue across Samsung, Shein, Klarna, Sony, and Checkout.com's entire merchant base. In the Agentic Commerce era, my models affect an expanding revenue surface — AI agent transaction volumes on top of existing human-initiated flows. ML Engineers whose models drive $100M+ in annual revenue impact should be compensated accordingly."

**Lever 4 — AI Talent Market Premium:** > "ML/AI Engineers are the most contested hiring category in technology. My competing offers from public companies and AI labs include $400K–$500K+ in liquid total comp. Checkout.com's options at the $12B valuation carry illiquidity risk. I need the option grant sized at $150K+/yr annualized — at this valuation, generous grants are cost-effective for the company and essential for competing with pure-play AI companies and FAANG ML teams for my talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $420K total comp ($250K base + $170K options/yr) for San Francisco. Lead with the Agentic Commerce ML mandate and frame the role as "the engineer building the intelligence layer for AI-Native Shopping Rails." Benchmark against Stripe Senior ML ($400K–$500K TC), Google L5 ML ($380K–$480K TC), and Meta IC5 ML ($400K–$520K TC), all offering liquid equity. Push the option grant to $170K/yr annualized — argue that ML engineers are the most contested talent category and that the $12B valuation makes generous grants the most cost-effective retention tool. If countered below $360K TC, demand a $40K sign-on, a $15K annual ML conference/compute budget, and a guaranteed 12-month option refresh. Accept-at floor: $275K TC with options at $90K+/yr.
