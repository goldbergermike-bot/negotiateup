### Senior Software Engineer — Checkout.com Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Checkout.com's Agentic Commerce strategy, translating the $12B valuation and Jan 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition into a senior engineering compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £90,000–£135,000 | £55,000–£110,000 | £145,000–£245,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $180,000–$230,000 | $85,000–$150,000 | $265,000–$380,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $175,000–$225,000 | $80,000–$140,000 | $255,000–$365,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Senior Software Engineer is the architectural backbone of Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails. With the $12B internal valuation marking confidence in the company's Agentic Commerce trajectory, and the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition opening an entirely new payment modality, Senior Engineers own the design and delivery of systems that AI agents will use to autonomously transact across global commerce. This is not incremental feature work on a mature processor — it is the construction of machine-to-machine payment infrastructure that must handle stablecoin settlement, autonomous transaction orchestration, and enterprise-grade reliability for clients like Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony. The combination of AI commerce architecture skills and payment systems expertise is extraordinarily rare. Total comp of $350K–$400K+ is justified at this level, particularly in US metro areas where Agentic Commerce infrastructure roles compete directly with FAANG-tier compensation.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Checkout.com | Stripe | Adyen | PPRO | Google | Meta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Senior Software Engineer (IC4) | L3 | Senior Software Engineer | Senior Engineer | L5 | E5 |
| Senior Software Engineer (IC5) | L3 (senior) | Lead Software Engineer | Lead Engineer | L5 (senior) | E5 (senior) |

At the IC4–IC5 level, Checkout.com competes directly with Stripe L3 ($350K–$450K TC in SF), Google L5 ($350K–$500K TC), and Adyen Senior/Lead tiers. PPRO's equivalent roles pay 15–25% below Checkout.com in London. When negotiating, anchor on Stripe L3 as the primary comp comparable and argue that Checkout.com's option illiquidity demands a 25–35% grant premium to achieve risk-adjusted parity with Stripe's liquid RSUs.

#### 🤖 Checkout.com Agentic Commerce & AI-Native Shopping Rails Lever

Checkout.com's $12B internal valuation is a bet on the company becoming the default payment processor for the Agentic Commerce era. The January 2026 acquisition of Blue EMI — securing a European EMI license for stablecoin-powered payments — demonstrates that Checkout.com is not waiting for AI commerce to arrive. It is building the infrastructure now: programmable money rails, machine-readable transaction APIs, and autonomous settlement systems that AI agents will use to initiate and complete purchases without human intervention.

For a Senior Software Engineer, this Agentic Commerce positioning transforms the role entirely. You are not maintaining checkout flows — you are designing the AI-Native Shopping Rails architecture. This means building systems that can process transactions initiated by AI shopping agents at machine speed, settle payments in stablecoins across jurisdictions using the Blue EMI license, handle the compliance complexity of programmable money, and maintain the enterprise-grade reliability that Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony demand.

The $12B valuation reflects confidence but also upside. If Checkout.com successfully executes on Agentic Commerce and stablecoin payments, the re-rating potential is significant — the company peaked at $40B and the AI commerce opportunity is arguably larger than the original payment processing opportunity. Senior Engineers joining now are positioned at the architectural level where they directly influence whether Checkout.com captures this market. Their option grants are struck at a valuation that embeds substantial upside if the Agentic Commerce thesis plays out.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — AI-Native Shopping Rails Architecture Ownership:** > "As a Senior Engineer, I'll be designing the core architecture of Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails — the transaction infrastructure that AI agents will use to autonomously complete purchases. Engineers who can architect machine-to-machine payment systems at this level are exceptionally rare. My comp needs to reflect architectural ownership of AI commerce infrastructure, not standard senior IC bands."

**Lever 2 — $12B Valuation with Clear Re-Rating Catalyst:** > "The $12B internal valuation is below the $40B peak, and the Agentic Commerce + Blue EMI stablecoin strategy represents a clear catalyst for re-rating. But I'm still taking illiquidity risk. The option grant needs to be sized at a significant premium to public-company RSUs — at minimum 25–35% above what I'd receive at Stripe L3 in equivalent annualized value — to make the risk-adjusted math work."

**Lever 3 — Blue EMI Stablecoin Settlement Systems:** > "The January 2026 Blue EMI acquisition means Checkout.com now has a European EMI license for stablecoin-powered payments. I'll be building the settlement infrastructure for an entirely new payment modality — stablecoin-based transactions that require understanding of both blockchain settlement mechanics and traditional payment compliance. This dual expertise commands a premium that Checkout.com's current bands may not reflect."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise AI Commerce Reliability:** > "Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony depend on Checkout.com for payment processing. As these enterprises deploy AI shopping agents, the reliability requirements intensify — autonomous agents transacting at machine speed means any latency or failure cascades across thousands of concurrent transactions. The Senior Engineer ensuring this reliability carries enterprise-critical responsibility and should be compensated at the top of band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $380K total comp ($230K base + $150K options/yr) for San Francisco. Lead with the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition and the $12B valuation as proof that Checkout.com is investing aggressively in AI-Native Shopping Rails. Cite $400K+ TC benchmarks at Stripe L3 and Google L5 as direct comparables, emphasizing that Checkout.com's Agentic Commerce mandate makes the role architecturally equivalent. Push hard on option grant size — argue that the $12B valuation sets a favorable strike price and the company should grant generously while the cost per share is relatively low. If countered below $320K TC, demand a sign-on bonus of $30K–$50K to bridge the gap. Accept-at floor: $265K TC with options annualized at minimum $85K/yr — below this, public-company liquid comp at Stripe or Google is strictly dominant.
