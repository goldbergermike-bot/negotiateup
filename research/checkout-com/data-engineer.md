### Data Engineer — Checkout.com Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Checkout.com's Agentic Commerce strategy, translating the $12B valuation and Jan 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition into a data engineering compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £78,000–£120,000 | £38,000–£85,000 | £116,000–£205,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $160,000–$220,000 | $70,000–$130,000 | $230,000–$350,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $155,000–$215,000 | $65,000–$125,000 | $220,000–$340,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Engineers at Checkout.com build the pipelines that move and transform one of the richest transaction datasets in global payments — and with the Agentic Commerce vision, that dataset is about to expand dramatically. The $12B internal valuation and the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition mean Data Engineers must now build pipelines for AI agent transaction data, stablecoin settlement flows, and programmable money analytics alongside traditional payment processing data. Enterprise clients like Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony generate billions of transaction records that must be ingested, transformed, enriched, and made available for real-time AI agent decision-making, stablecoin settlement reconciliation, and enterprise analytics. This is not standard ETL work — it is building the data infrastructure for AI-Native Shopping Rails. Total comp of $310K–$350K+ is defensible for experienced Data Engineers in US metros.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Checkout.com | Stripe | Adyen | PPRO | Google | Meta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data Engineer | L4 DE | IC4 DE |
| Senior Data Engineer | Senior DE | Senior DE | Senior DE | L5 DE | IC5 DE |
| Staff Data Engineer | Staff DE | Lead DE | Lead DE | L6 DE | IC6 DE |

Checkout.com DE bands map to Stripe DE ($280K–$400K TC in SF) and Google L4–L5 DE ($290K–$420K TC). Adyen Data Engineers in Amsterdam earn 15–25% below SF benchmarks. PPRO DE roles pay 20–30% below Checkout.com in London. The Agentic Commerce data mandate — AI agent transaction data pipelines, stablecoin settlement data, and real-time ML feature engineering — adds pipeline complexity that standard payment DE roles lack.

#### 🤖 Checkout.com Agentic Commerce & AI-Native Shopping Rails Lever

Checkout.com's $12B internal valuation reflects a company investing in becoming the data infrastructure layer for AI commerce. The January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition introduces an entirely new data domain: stablecoin settlement data, blockchain transaction records, and programmable money flow analytics that must be integrated into Checkout.com's existing data platform.

For Data Engineers, the Agentic Commerce vision creates a data pipeline challenge of unprecedented scope. You must build real-time data pipelines for AI agent transactions — machine-initiated payments at machine speed that generate transaction data at volumes and velocities that exceed human shopping behavior. You must integrate Blue EMI stablecoin settlement data — blockchain settlement records, stablecoin transfer logs, and cross-border payment flow data — into the existing data warehouse and streaming infrastructure. You must build the feature engineering pipelines that power ML models for AI agent fraud detection, autonomous transaction optimization, and stablecoin settlement analytics. And you must ensure that all of this data is available for enterprise client reporting, regulatory compliance, and internal analytics with banking-grade accuracy and auditability.

Data Engineers who can build pipelines across traditional payments, AI agent transactions, and stablecoin settlement are constructing the data nervous system for Agentic Commerce. The $12B valuation offers favorable option economics for those joining at this data infrastructure inflection point.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — AI Agent Transaction Data Pipelines:** > "Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails will generate a new category of transaction data — machine-initiated payments at machine speed. I'll be building the real-time data pipelines that ingest, transform, and serve this AI agent transaction data. The volume, velocity, and variety characteristics of AI agent transaction data differ fundamentally from human shopping data — this is a new data engineering discipline."

**Lever 2 — Blue EMI Stablecoin Data Integration:** > "The January 2026 Blue EMI acquisition introduces blockchain settlement data, stablecoin transfer records, and programmable money flow data that must be integrated into Checkout.com's data platform. I'll be building the pipelines that connect blockchain-native data with traditional payment data — a dual-modality data engineering challenge that no major payment processor has solved at enterprise scale."

**Lever 3 — Enterprise Data Infrastructure Revenue Impact:** > "Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony depend on Checkout.com's data infrastructure for transaction analytics, reconciliation, and reporting. My data pipelines serve the company's entire revenue base. In the Agentic Commerce era, the data infrastructure must also power AI agent decision-making and stablecoin settlement analytics — the revenue surface my pipelines support is expanding rapidly."

**Lever 4 — $12B Valuation Options for Infrastructure Talent:** > "Data Engineers building the pipeline infrastructure for AI-Native Shopping Rails are creating systems that will serve Checkout.com for years. At the $12B valuation, option grants are struck at a favorable price. I need $110K+/yr annualized in options to compensate for the illiquidity risk versus liquid RSU offers from public companies like Stripe and Google."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $350K total comp ($220K base + $130K options/yr) for San Francisco. Frame the role as "Agentic Commerce Data Infrastructure Engineer" — the person building the data nervous system for Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails and Blue EMI stablecoin integration. Benchmark against Stripe Senior DE ($320K–$400K TC) and Google L5 DE ($330K–$420K TC). Push options to $130K/yr annualized at the $12B valuation. If countered below $285K TC, negotiate a $25K sign-on bonus and a data platform certification/training budget ($10K/yr). Accept-at floor: $230K TC with options at $70K+/yr.
