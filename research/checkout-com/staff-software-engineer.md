#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £120,000–£165,000 | £80,000–£160,000 | £200,000–£325,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $230,000–$290,000 | $130,000–$220,000 | $360,000–$510,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $225,000–$280,000 | $120,000–$200,000 | $345,000–$480,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Staff Software Engineer at Checkout.com is the technical leader defining how AI-Native Shopping Rails are built. With the $12B internal valuation and the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition expanding Checkout.com into programmable money infrastructure, Staff Engineers set the architectural direction for systems that AI agents will depend on for autonomous commerce. At this level, you are not implementing features — you are making the cross-cutting technical decisions that determine whether Checkout.com becomes the default transaction layer for Agentic Commerce. The rarity of engineers who can operate at the intersection of staff-level distributed systems design, payment processing compliance, stablecoin settlement, and AI-native API architecture makes this one of the most premium talent markets in fintech. Total comp of $450K–$510K+ is defensible, benchmarked against Stripe L4 and Google L6 equivalents.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Checkout.com | Stripe | Adyen | PPRO | Google | Meta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Staff Software Engineer (IC6) | L4 | Principal Engineer | Principal Engineer | L6 | E6 |

Checkout.com's Staff Engineer maps to Stripe L4 ($450K–$600K TC in SF), Google L6 ($500K–$700K TC), and Adyen Principal. PPRO's equivalent Principal roles pay 20–30% below Checkout.com in London due to PPRO's narrower market position. When negotiating, anchor on Stripe L4 as the primary comparable and emphasize that Checkout.com's Agentic Commerce mandate — building AI-native payment rails plus stablecoin infrastructure — represents greater technical scope than Stripe's current product surface.

#### 🤖 Checkout.com Agentic Commerce & AI-Native Shopping Rails Lever

At the Staff level, the Agentic Commerce thesis is not an abstract strategy — it is the architecture you are responsible for defining. Checkout.com's $12B internal valuation prices in the company's potential to become the dominant payment processor for AI-initiated transactions. The January 2026 Blue EMI acquisition — securing a European EMI license for stablecoin-powered payments — adds an entirely new settlement modality that must be integrated into the core payment platform.

Staff Engineers at Checkout.com are making decisions that will determine how AI agents interact with payment infrastructure for the next decade. This includes designing APIs that are optimized for machine consumption rather than human-driven checkout flows, architecting stablecoin settlement systems that leverage the Blue EMI license across European jurisdictions, building the transaction orchestration layer that allows AI agents to autonomously select payment methods (including stablecoins) based on cost, speed, and regulatory constraints, and ensuring that enterprise clients like Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony can seamlessly enable AI agent purchasing on top of Checkout.com's rails.

The $12B valuation represents a compelling entry point for options. If Checkout.com successfully executes on Agentic Commerce — becoming the Stripe of AI-initiated transactions — the re-rating potential toward and beyond the $40B peak is substantial. Staff Engineers joining now hold architectural influence over whether this thesis succeeds, and their option grants should reflect that leverage.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Agentic Commerce Architecture Authority:** > "At the Staff level, I'm not implementing specifications — I'm defining the technical architecture for Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails. The decisions I make about API design, transaction orchestration, and stablecoin settlement patterns will determine whether Checkout.com wins the Agentic Commerce market. This architectural authority over a $12B company's strategic direction justifies top-of-band compensation."

**Lever 2 — $12B Valuation with Asymmetric Options Upside:** > "The $12B internal valuation is a fraction of the $40B peak, and the Agentic Commerce plus Blue EMI stablecoin strategy creates a clear path to re-rating. At the Staff level, my option grant needs to reflect both the illiquidity risk and the outsized architectural influence I have over whether the company hits the valuation catalysts. I'm looking for option grants at the Stripe L4 equivalent — $200K+ annualized — with the understanding that Checkout.com's strike price makes each option significantly more leveraged."

**Lever 3 — Stablecoin Settlement Architecture:** > "The January 2026 Blue EMI acquisition means someone at the Staff level needs to design how stablecoin settlement integrates with Checkout.com's existing payment rails. This is unprecedented architectural work — no major payment processor has successfully built dual-modality settlement (traditional + stablecoin) at enterprise scale. The engineer who architects this system is creating a capability that competitors will spend years trying to replicate."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Functional AI Commerce Leadership:** > "Agentic Commerce is not a single-team initiative — it spans payments, risk, compliance, infrastructure, and AI/ML. Staff Engineers at Checkout.com must lead across all of these domains to deliver AI-Native Shopping Rails. This cross-functional technical leadership is the definition of Staff-level impact and should be compensated at the top of the Staff band with significant option upside."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $510K total comp ($290K base + $220K options/yr) for San Francisco. Anchor on the Agentic Commerce architectural mandate and the Blue EMI stablecoin integration as Staff-level scope that exceeds typical payment processor Staff roles. Cite $500K–$600K TC at Stripe L4 and $500K–$700K TC at Google L6 as the competitive set. Argue that Checkout.com's $12B valuation creates an unusually favorable strike price, and the option grant should be sized to reflect both the illiquidity premium and the Staff-level influence over whether the company hits its re-rating catalysts. If countered below $420K TC, push for a sign-on bonus of $50K–$75K and an accelerated first-year vesting schedule. Accept-at floor: $360K TC with options annualized at minimum $130K/yr — below this, Stripe L4 or Google L6 with liquid equity is the strictly dominant choice.
