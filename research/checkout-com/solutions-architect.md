#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £95,000–£140,000 | £50,000–£100,000 | £145,000–£240,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $185,000–$245,000 | $80,000–$150,000 | $265,000–$395,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $180,000–$240,000 | $75,000–$140,000 | $255,000–$380,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Solutions Architects at Checkout.com are the technical bridge between the AI-Native Shopping Rails platform and the company's most valuable enterprise relationships. When Samsung, Shein, Klarna, or Sony evaluates Checkout.com's Agentic Commerce capabilities or stablecoin payment options via the Blue EMI acquisition, the Solutions Architect is the person in the room designing the integration architecture and demonstrating technical differentiation. With the $12B internal valuation and the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition creating entirely new integration patterns, Solutions Architects are designing how enterprise merchants connect their AI shopping agents to Checkout.com's payment rails and how stablecoin settlement integrates with existing treasury workflows. This is not standard payment integration work — it is architecting the technical interface between enterprise commerce and the AI-native payment future. Total comp of $350K–$395K+ is defensible in US metros.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Checkout.com | Stripe | Adyen | PPRO | Google | Meta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect | Solutions Engineer | Solutions Architect | L5 Solutions Eng | IC5 Solutions Arch |
| Senior Solutions Architect | Senior SA | Senior SE | Senior SA | L6 Solutions Eng | IC6 Solutions Arch |
| Principal Solutions Architect | Principal SA | Principal SE | Principal SA | L7 Solutions Eng | IC7 Solutions Arch |

Checkout.com SA bands map to Stripe SA ($300K–$430K TC in SF) and Google L5–L6 Solutions ($320K–$480K TC). Adyen Solutions Engineers in Amsterdam earn 15–25% below SF benchmarks. PPRO SAs are 20–30% below Checkout.com in London. The Agentic Commerce integration mandate — designing how AI agents connect to payment rails and how stablecoin settlement integrates with enterprise treasury — exceeds the scope of typical payment SA roles.

#### 🤖 Checkout.com Agentic Commerce & AI-Native Shopping Rails Lever

Checkout.com's $12B internal valuation is a bet on the company becoming the payment infrastructure layer for Agentic Commerce. The January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition — securing a European EMI license for stablecoin-powered payments — adds stablecoin settlement as a new integration option that Solutions Architects must design into enterprise architectures.

For Solutions Architects, the Agentic Commerce vision transforms every enterprise engagement. Instead of designing traditional checkout flow integrations, SAs are now architecting how enterprise merchants' AI shopping agents connect to Checkout.com's API-first payment rails. This means designing authentication and authorization flows for AI agents (not human users), building integration patterns for autonomous transaction initiation and completion, architecting stablecoin settlement workflows using the Blue EMI license, and ensuring that AI agent transactions produce the reporting and analytics data that enterprise treasury teams need.

Solutions Architects who can design these Agentic Commerce integrations are directly responsible for enterprise revenue. Each successful AI commerce integration for a client like Samsung or Sony represents tens of millions in annual processing volume. The $12B valuation and favorable option economics mean that SAs joining now receive strike prices well below the $40B peak, with the Agentic Commerce enterprise adoption curve as the primary re-rating catalyst.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Agentic Commerce Integration Architecture:** > "I'll be designing how enterprise merchants' AI agents connect to Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails — authentication, transaction initiation, autonomous payment completion, and settlement. This is a net-new integration paradigm that no payment processor has fully defined. The SA who creates these Agentic Commerce integration patterns at a $12B company is doing foundational work worth premium compensation."

**Lever 2 — Blue EMI Stablecoin Integration Design:** > "The January 2026 Blue EMI acquisition gives Checkout.com stablecoin settlement capabilities. I'll be designing how enterprise merchants integrate stablecoin payments into their existing treasury workflows — settlement timing, currency conversion, compliance documentation, and cross-border optimization. This is greenfield integration architecture for a payment modality most enterprise treasury teams have never used."

**Lever 3 — Enterprise Revenue Attribution:** > "Every enterprise integration I design generates measurable revenue. Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony each represent tens of millions in annual processing volume. When these enterprises adopt Agentic Commerce and stablecoin payments, my integration designs determine how much volume flows through Checkout.com. SAs with this direct revenue attribution should be compensated at the intersection of enterprise sales engineering and senior architecture bands."

**Lever 4 — $12B Valuation Options for Client-Facing Hires:** > "I'm choosing between Checkout.com options at a $12B valuation and liquid RSUs at Stripe, Adyen, or public cloud companies. As a client-facing hire, my revenue impact is immediate and measurable. The Agentic Commerce enterprise adoption curve provides a clear catalyst for options appreciation, but I need the grant sized at $130K+/yr annualized to make the risk-return math work versus liquid alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $395K total comp ($245K base + $150K options/yr) for San Francisco. Frame yourself as an "Agentic Commerce enterprise architect" — the person designing how Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony connect their AI agents to Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails and Blue EMI stablecoin settlement. Benchmark against Stripe Senior SA ($340K–$430K TC) and Google L6 Solutions ($370K–$480K TC), emphasizing direct revenue attribution. Push options to $150K/yr annualized at the $12B valuation. If countered below $330K TC, negotiate a $35K sign-on bonus and a variable commission component tied to Agentic Commerce enterprise integration wins ($15K–$25K per major deal). Accept-at floor: $265K TC with options at $80K+/yr.
