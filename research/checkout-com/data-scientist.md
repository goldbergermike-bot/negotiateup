#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £80,000–£125,000 | £40,000–£90,000 | £120,000–£215,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $165,000–$225,000 | $75,000–$140,000 | $240,000–$365,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $160,000–$220,000 | $70,000–$135,000 | $230,000–$355,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Scientists at Checkout.com sit at the center of the company's most valuable asset: its transaction data. With the $12B internal valuation and the January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition opening entirely new data dimensions, Data Scientists are building the analytical intelligence layer for AI-Native Shopping Rails. This means developing models that help AI agents make optimal transaction decisions, analyzing stablecoin settlement patterns, and quantifying the revenue impact of Agentic Commerce across enterprise clients like Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony. The combination of payment transaction analytics, AI agent behavior modeling, and stablecoin settlement data science is a rare and premium skill set. Total comp of $330K–$365K+ is defensible for experienced Data Scientists in US metros.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Checkout.com | Stripe | Adyen | PPRO | Google | Meta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Analyst | L4 DS | IC4 DS |
| Senior Data Scientist | Senior DS | Senior DS | Senior Data Analyst | L5 DS | IC5 DS |
| Staff Data Scientist | Staff DS | Lead DS | Lead Analyst | L6 DS | IC6 DS |

Checkout.com DS bands map to Stripe DS ($300K–$420K TC in SF) and Google L4–L5 DS ($280K–$450K TC). Adyen Data Scientists in Amsterdam earn 15–25% below SF benchmarks. PPRO's equivalent roles are 20–30% below Checkout.com in London. The Agentic Commerce analytics mandate — modeling AI agent transaction behavior and stablecoin settlement patterns — adds analytical scope that typical payment processor DS roles lack.

#### 🤖 Checkout.com Agentic Commerce & AI-Native Shopping Rails Lever

Checkout.com's $12B internal valuation reflects the company's position as the premium enterprise payment processor for the AI commerce era. The January 2026 Blue EMI stablecoin acquisition adds an entirely new data domain: programmable money flows, stablecoin settlement analytics, and cross-border payment optimization data that didn't exist in Checkout.com's datasets before.

For Data Scientists, the Agentic Commerce vision creates new analytical challenges that go far beyond traditional payment analytics. You must model AI agent transaction behavior — understanding how autonomous purchasing agents interact with Checkout.com's APIs, identifying patterns that distinguish legitimate AI agent transactions from fraudulent ones, and optimizing authorization rates for machine-initiated payments. You must analyze stablecoin settlement data from the Blue EMI integration — settlement speeds, cost comparisons versus traditional card networks, and cross-border efficiency metrics that help merchants decide when to use stablecoin payments. And you must quantify the revenue impact of Agentic Commerce for enterprise clients, translating AI agent transaction volumes and stablecoin settlement savings into business intelligence that drives product and sales strategy.

The $12B valuation and the $40B peak create favorable option economics. Data Scientists joining now receive option grants struck at a valuation that embeds significant upside if Agentic Commerce and stablecoin payments drive re-rating.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — AI Agent Transaction Analytics:** > "Checkout.com's AI-Native Shopping Rails will generate a new category of transaction data — AI agent purchasing behavior. I'll be the Data Scientist building the models that analyze this data: agent transaction patterns, authorization optimization for machine-initiated payments, and fraud detection for autonomous transactions. This is a new analytical discipline that didn't exist before Agentic Commerce, and the DS who defines it at a $12B company commands premium compensation."

**Lever 2 — Blue EMI Stablecoin Settlement Analytics:** > "The January 2026 Blue EMI acquisition gives Checkout.com stablecoin payment data for the first time. I'll be analyzing settlement patterns, cost comparisons versus traditional rails, and cross-border efficiency metrics that inform the stablecoin product strategy. This is frontier analytics work — no major payment processor has a Data Scientist analyzing stablecoin settlement data at enterprise scale."

**Lever 3 — Revenue Impact Quantification:** > "Every basis point of authorization rate improvement on Checkout.com's platform translates to millions in revenue for enterprise clients like Samsung, Shein, Klarna, and Sony. My models directly impact the company's revenue trajectory. With Agentic Commerce adding AI agent transaction volumes on top of existing flows, the total revenue surface my analytics affect is expanding rapidly."

**Lever 4 — $12B Valuation Options for Data Talent:** > "Data Scientists with payments domain expertise are in extreme demand. My competing offers include liquid RSUs at public companies. Checkout.com's options at the $12B valuation carry illiquidity risk, but the Agentic Commerce and Blue EMI catalysts provide a clear upside story. I need the option grant sized at $120K+/yr annualized to make the risk-adjusted math work versus liquid alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $365K total comp ($225K base + $140K options/yr) for San Francisco. Lead with the Agentic Commerce analytics mandate and the Blue EMI stablecoin data science opportunity. Cite Stripe Senior DS ($340K–$420K TC) and Google L5 DS ($350K–$450K TC) as direct comparables, noting liquid equity. Push options to $140K/yr annualized at the $12B valuation. Emphasize the revenue-per-basis-point math — a DS who improves authorization rates by 10bps on billions in volume generates tens of millions in value. If countered below $300K TC, demand a $30K sign-on and a guaranteed 12-month performance option refresh. Accept-at floor: $240K TC with options at $75K+/yr.
