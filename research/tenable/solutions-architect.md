## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Sales Engineering Revenue Impact

> "As a Solutions Architect, I directly influence pipeline conversion. In my current role, my POC win rate is 78%, and I've contributed to $15M in closed revenue. I'd like a base of $190,000 with a $140,000 RSU grant over 4 years, plus a variable compensation structure tied to deal outcomes."

### Lever 2: Cybersecurity Domain & Enterprise Expertise

> "I bring deep expertise in vulnerability management, compliance frameworks, and enterprise security architecture. This domain knowledge accelerates deal cycles and reduces ramp time. I have a competing SA offer from Palo Alto Networks at $200,000 total comp — I need Tenable to be competitive."

### Lever 3: RSU Equity Alignment with Revenue Growth

> "As someone who directly drives revenue, my equity on NASDAQ: TENB should reflect the correlation between my deal contributions and Tenable's stock performance. I'd like an additional $25,000 in RSUs over 4 years to align my compensation with the revenue impact I bring."

### Lever 4: Regional Market Premium & Signing Bonus

> "The SA talent market in [Columbia MD / Austin / London] is extremely competitive, with cybersecurity companies aggressively recruiting experienced pre-sales engineers. A signing bonus of $25,000 would offset my transition costs, and a $10,000 base adjustment would align with regional market rates for SA talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $190,000 base (Columbia MD) / $185,000 (Austin) / £120,000 (London) with a request for $140,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $25,000 signing bonus. Reference a competing offer from Palo Alto Networks or CrowdStrike at $200,000 base plus variable comp. Your accept-at floor should be $160,000 base with $90,000 RSUs and a $15,000 sign-on — below this threshold, negotiate for a guaranteed variable compensation floor or additional RSUs.
