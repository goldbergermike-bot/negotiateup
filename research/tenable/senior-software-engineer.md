### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in the exposure management market — an endorsement that signals category dominance and directly impacts your negotiation power. This designation validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology, which transforms raw vulnerability data into business-contextual risk intelligence.

As a Senior Software Engineer, you architect the systems that make **AI-powered** ExposureAI work at scale within the **Tenable One** unified platform. You are not just writing code — you are building the technical moat that earned the Gartner recognition. Deploy this lever:

*"Gartner designated Tenable as the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026, which tells me Tenable is at an inflection point where senior engineering talent will define whether you sustain this lead. My architecture and system design experience directly supports the Risk-Aware Exposure methodology and AI-powered capabilities in Tenable One. I want my offer to reflect the impact a senior engineer has at this critical moment."*

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Technical Depth & System Design Premium

> "At the senior level, I bring system design expertise that directly accelerates Tenable One's platform capabilities. I have competing offers from CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks at $200,000+ base, and I'd like Tenable to be competitive with a base of $185,000 and an enhanced RSU grant."

### Lever 2: RSU Acceleration & Equity Confidence

> "Given Tenable's Gartner 'Company to Beat' recognition on Feb 12, 2026, and the NASDAQ: TENB growth trajectory, I'd like to increase the RSU grant from $100,000 to $140,000 over 4 years. I'm betting on Tenable's stock, and I want the grant to reflect my senior-level impact on that trajectory."

### Lever 3: Cross-Office Salary Benchmarking

> "I've benchmarked senior cybersecurity engineering salaries across Columbia MD, Austin, and the London market. The offer I have from a competitor in Austin is $12,000 above what's been proposed. I'd like to discuss adjusting the base to reflect the competitive landscape in this specific market."

### Lever 4: Unvested Equity Bridge & Signing Bonus

> "I'm walking away from approximately $45,000 in unvested RSUs at my current employer. A signing bonus of $25,000–$30,000 would demonstrate Tenable's commitment to securing me at this level and offset the financial cost of my transition."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $185,000 base (Columbia MD) / $180,000 (Austin) / £115,000 (London) with a request for $140,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $28,000 signing bonus. Reference a competing offer from CrowdStrike or Palo Alto Networks with a $205,000 total comp package. Your accept-at floor should be $165,000 base with $95,000 RSUs and a $15,000 sign-on — below this threshold, counter aggressively or explore alternative offers.
