## Compensation Benchmarks by Region

| Component | Columbia MD (USD) | Austin (USD) | London (GBP £) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base Salary | $175,000 – $215,000 | $170,000 – $210,000 | £105,000 – £140,000 |
| Annual Bonus | 15–20% target | 15–20% target | 15–20% target |
| RSU Grant (4-Year Vest) | $120,000 – $220,000 | $110,000 – $210,000 | £75,000 – £140,000 |
| Signing Bonus | $20,000 – $40,000 | $20,000 – $40,000 | £12,000 – £25,000 |
| Total Year-1 Comp | $260,000 – $370,000 | $250,000 – $355,000 | £160,000 – £240,000 |

**Equity Note:** All RSU grants vest over 4 years on a standard schedule (typically 25% per year) and are priced on Tenable's NASDAQ: TENB ticker. RSUs are real shares — not options — eliminating strike-price risk. Engineering Managers typically receive annual RSU refreshers tied to team performance and retention risk.

### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in the exposure management category — a recognition that places enormous strategic importance on engineering execution. This designation validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology and positions your team as the builders of the market-leading platform.

As an Engineering Manager, you are responsible for the team velocity and quality that powers the **AI-powered** ExposureAI capabilities within the **Tenable One** unified platform. Your ability to recruit, retain, and lead top engineers is what will sustain Tenable's Gartner position. Use this lever:

*"Gartner named Tenable the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026, and sustaining that position depends on engineering execution — which is my direct responsibility. I'll be building and leading the teams that advance Risk-Aware Exposure capabilities and AI-powered ExposureAI features in Tenable One. My compensation should reflect the management premium for leading at a company in this market-defining position."*

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Management Premium & Team-Building Track Record

> "I've built and scaled engineering teams from 5 to 20+ engineers at my current company, with retention rates above 90%. Bringing this leadership capability to Tenable during a critical growth phase — especially post-Gartner recognition — warrants a base of $210,000 and a management-level RSU grant of $200,000 over 4 years."

### Lever 2: Equity as Retention Alignment

> "Engineering Manager retention directly impacts team stability. I'd like the RSU grant on NASDAQ: TENB to be front-loaded — 35% in year one — to align my financial incentives with the critical first 18 months of team building. An additional $30,000 in RSUs would signal Tenable's investment in management continuity."

### Lever 3: Regional Management Talent Scarcity

> "Experienced engineering managers in the cybersecurity space are exceptionally scarce in [Columbia MD / Austin / London]. I have a competing EM offer from Rapid7 at $225,000 base plus $180,000 in equity. I'd like Tenable to be competitive on both dimensions."

### Lever 4: Transition Cost & Signing Bonus Justification

> "I'm leaving a management role with $60,000 in unvested equity and a pending promotion. A signing bonus of $35,000 would offset this opportunity cost and demonstrate Tenable's commitment to bringing experienced engineering leadership aboard quickly."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $210,000 base (Columbia MD) / $205,000 (Austin) / £135,000 (London) with a request for $200,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $35,000 signing bonus. Reference a competing offer from Rapid7 or CrowdStrike at $240,000 base plus equity. Your accept-at floor should be $185,000 base with $140,000 RSUs and a $20,000 sign-on — below this threshold, negotiate for additional RSU refreshers or escalate.
