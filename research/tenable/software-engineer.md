### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in the exposure management category — a landmark analyst endorsement that fundamentally changes your negotiation posture. This designation validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology, which goes beyond legacy vulnerability scanning to deliver continuous, contextual risk assessment across the entire attack surface.

Tenable's **AI-powered** ExposureAI capabilities now drive predictive analytics and automated prioritization within the **Tenable One** unified platform. As a Software Engineer, you are building the infrastructure that earned this Gartner recognition. Use this lever directly:

*"Gartner just named Tenable the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026. I'm excited to join a team at this inflection point, and I want my compensation to reflect the caliber of engineer Tenable needs to maintain that position. My work on the platform directly supports the Risk-Aware Exposure approach and AI-powered capabilities in Tenable One that earned this recognition."*

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Market Scarcity & Cybersecurity Talent Premium

> "Cybersecurity engineering talent is scarce globally, and I have competing interest from [CrowdStrike / Palo Alto Networks / Rapid7]. My skills in building secure, scalable platforms are directly transferable, and I want to ensure Tenable's offer reflects the market premium for this expertise."

### Lever 2: RSU Equity Upside & Gartner Validation

> "With Tenable's stock on NASDAQ: TENB and the recent Gartner 'Company to Beat' designation on Feb 12, 2026, I see strong upside in RSU equity. I'd like to increase the initial RSU grant to reflect my confidence in Tenable One's trajectory — an additional $20,000 in RSUs over 4 years would align my compensation with senior offers I'm evaluating."

### Lever 3: Regional Cost-of-Living Adjustment

> "While I'm excited about the Columbia MD [or Austin / London] role, the cost of living in this market is significant. I'd like to discuss a base salary adjustment of $8,000–$12,000 to ensure parity with offers I've received from companies in comparable markets."

### Lever 4: Signing Bonus as Bridge Compensation

> "I'm leaving unvested equity at my current employer worth approximately $25,000. A signing bonus of $15,000–$20,000 would bridge this gap and allow me to make the transition without financial penalty, which accelerates my start date."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $148,000 base (Columbia MD) / $142,000 (Austin) / £88,000 (London) with a request for $75,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $18,000 signing bonus. Reference a competing offer from CrowdStrike or Palo Alto Networks at $155,000 total comp. Your accept-at floor should be $135,000 base with $55,000 RSUs and a $10,000 sign-on — below this threshold, push back or walk.
