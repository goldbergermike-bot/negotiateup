### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in exposure management — a recognition that depends on the execution velocity that TPMs drive. This designation validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology, and sustaining market leadership requires the kind of cross-functional coordination that only experienced TPMs deliver.

As a Technical Program Manager, you drive the delivery of **AI-powered** ExposureAI features and coordinate the roadmap execution for the **Tenable One** unified platform across multiple engineering teams. Your program management ensures that Gartner-winning features ship on time and at quality. Use this lever:

*"Gartner named Tenable the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026, and sustaining that position requires flawless cross-functional execution — exactly what I deliver as a TPM. I'll be driving the programs that advance Risk-Aware Exposure capabilities and AI-powered ExposureAI features within Tenable One. My ability to coordinate across engineering, product, and security teams accelerates Tenable's roadmap execution. My compensation should reflect the execution premium I bring at this critical moment."*

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Program Execution Track Record

> "I've delivered $50M+ in product initiatives on time, managing cross-functional programs with 5+ engineering teams. At Tenable, this execution capability directly impacts Tenable One's roadmap velocity. I'd like a base of $180,000 with a $130,000 RSU grant over 4 years to reflect my program delivery premium."

### Lever 2: Cybersecurity Domain Knowledge

> "TPMs with cybersecurity domain expertise are rare — I bring both program management rigor and security product knowledge. This eliminates the 3–6 month domain ramp and lets me contribute from week one. A $12,000 base premium and $15,000 additional RSUs would reflect this specialization."

### Lever 3: Competing Offers from Tech Leaders

> "I have a TPM offer from Amazon at $185,000 base with $130,000 in RSUs. While Tenable's mission in exposure management is more aligned with my career goals, I need the NASDAQ: TENB equity package to be competitive with FAANG-level offers."

### Lever 4: Signing Bonus & Transition Bridge

> "I'm leaving $30,000 in unvested equity and a promoted TPM position at my current employer. A signing bonus of $24,000 would bridge the financial gap and allow me to commit to Tenable's mission without penalty."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $180,000 base (Columbia MD) / $175,000 (Austin) / £115,000 (London) with a request for $130,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $24,000 signing bonus. Reference a competing offer from Amazon or CrowdStrike at $185,000 base plus equity. Your accept-at floor should be $155,000 base with $85,000 RSUs and a $12,000 sign-on — below this threshold, negotiate for a guaranteed annual refresher or escalate.
