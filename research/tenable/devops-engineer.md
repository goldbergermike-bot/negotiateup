### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in exposure management — a position that depends on infrastructure reliability and platform performance. This designation validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology, and sustaining it requires the DevOps engineering excellence that keeps the platform available at scale.

As a DevOps Engineer, you ensure the **AI-powered** ExposureAI capabilities run reliably within the **Tenable One** unified platform. Your work on deployment pipelines, infrastructure automation, and platform resilience directly impacts the uptime and performance that customers and Gartner analysts evaluate. Use this lever:

*"Gartner named Tenable the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026, and that position depends on the infrastructure reliability and deployment velocity I'll be responsible for. The Risk-Aware Exposure methodology and AI-powered ExposureAI features in Tenable One are only as strong as the infrastructure supporting them. My DevOps expertise ensures the platform delivers on its market-leading promise — and my compensation should reflect this critical infrastructure role."*

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Cloud & Security Infrastructure Expertise

> "I bring deep expertise in AWS/Azure infrastructure, Kubernetes orchestration, and security-hardened CI/CD pipelines. This combination is rare in the DevOps market — I'd like a base of $165,000 with a $100,000 RSU grant over 4 years to reflect the security-infrastructure premium."

### Lever 2: Platform Uptime & SLA Impact

> "At my current company, I improved platform uptime from 99.9% to 99.99% — directly impacting customer retention and ARR. At Tenable, this translates to measurable business value. I'd like the RSU grant on NASDAQ: TENB to be increased by $20,000 to reflect the revenue impact of infrastructure reliability."

### Lever 3: Competing Infrastructure Offers

> "I have an offer from a cloud-native company at $175,000 base with $120,000 in equity. Tenable's cybersecurity mission is more compelling, but I need the total compensation to be within range. An additional $8,000 to the base and $15,000 to the RSU grant would make this competitive."

### Lever 4: On-Call Premium & Signing Bonus

> "DevOps roles at Tenable include on-call responsibilities for production infrastructure. I'd like a signing bonus of $18,000 to offset the transition costs from my current role, plus consideration for an on-call stipend that reflects the operational demands of this position."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $165,000 base (Columbia MD) / $160,000 (Austin) / £102,000 (London) with a request for $100,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $18,000 signing bonus. Reference a competing offer from a cloud-native company or CrowdStrike at $175,000 base. Your accept-at floor should be $145,000 base with $70,000 RSUs and a $10,000 sign-on — below this threshold, negotiate for on-call compensation or additional RSUs.
