### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in exposure management — a position built on the data infrastructure that enables comprehensive risk analysis at scale. This designation validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology, which depends on data pipelines that process massive volumes of vulnerability, asset, and threat data with low latency and high reliability.

As a Data Engineer, your pipelines power the **AI-powered** ExposureAI engine and deliver the data foundation for the **Tenable One** unified platform. Without robust data engineering, the analytical capabilities that Gartner recognized would not exist. Use this lever:

*"Gartner named Tenable the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026, and Tenable's Risk-Aware Exposure methodology is only as strong as the data pipelines I'll be building. The AI-powered ExposureAI capabilities in Tenable One depend on data infrastructure that processes billions of signals reliably and at scale. My data engineering expertise directly enables the analytical depth that earned this Gartner recognition — and my compensation should reflect the foundational importance of this work."*

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Large-Scale Data Pipeline Expertise

> "I've built data pipelines processing 10B+ events daily at my current company, with expertise in Kafka, Spark, and real-time streaming architectures. This experience directly translates to Tenable's data scale. I'd like a base of $175,000 with a $125,000 RSU grant over 4 years to reflect the premium for data engineers who operate at this scale."

### Lever 2: Cybersecurity Data Domain Knowledge

> "I understand cybersecurity data models — CVEs, CVSS scoring, asset taxonomies, and threat intelligence formats. This domain knowledge eliminates ramp time and lets me contribute to Tenable One's data infrastructure from day one. A $10,000 base premium and $15,000 additional RSUs on NASDAQ: TENB would reflect this specialization."

### Lever 3: Competing Data Engineering Offers

> "I have a data engineering offer from Snowflake at $180,000 base with $140,000 in equity. Tenable's cybersecurity mission is more compelling to me, but the total compensation gap needs to narrow. An increase of $8,000 to the base and $20,000 to the RSU grant would make Tenable competitive."

### Lever 4: Signing Bonus for Transition Costs

> "I'm leaving $28,000 in unvested equity at my current employer. A signing bonus of $22,000 would bridge this gap and remove the financial barrier to joining Tenable at a critical moment for the platform's data infrastructure evolution."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $175,000 base (Columbia MD) / $170,000 (Austin) / £110,000 (London) with a request for $125,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $22,000 signing bonus. Reference a competing offer from Snowflake or Databricks at $180,000 base plus equity. Your accept-at floor should be $148,000 base with $80,000 RSUs and a $12,000 sign-on — below this threshold, push for additional RSUs or a guaranteed first-year refresher.
