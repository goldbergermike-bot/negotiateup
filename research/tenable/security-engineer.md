### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in exposure management — a designation that places Tenable's own security posture under intense scrutiny. This recognition validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology, and any security incident at a company that sells security would be catastrophic to both brand and stock price.

As a Security Engineer, you protect the **AI-powered** ExposureAI engine and the **Tenable One** unified platform from the same threats Tenable helps its customers manage. Your work is the credibility foundation that makes Gartner's designation sustainable. Use this lever:

*"Gartner named Tenable the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026 — which means Tenable's own security is under a microscope. As a Security Engineer, I'm protecting the Risk-Aware Exposure methodology, AI-powered ExposureAI capabilities, and the Tenable One platform from adversaries who would love to compromise a security vendor. A breach at Tenable would devastate the brand and the NASDAQ: TENB stock. My compensation should reflect the existential importance of internal security at a company that sells security."*

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Security Vendor Credibility Premium

> "Working security at a security company carries unique responsibility — a breach at Tenable would be far more damaging than at a typical tech company. I bring offensive security expertise and AppSec skills that directly protect Tenable's brand credibility. I'd like a base of $185,000 with a $135,000 RSU grant over 4 years to reflect this heightened responsibility."

### Lever 2: Vulnerability Research & Threat Intelligence Expertise

> "I have published vulnerability research and hold [OSCP/OSCE/GXPN] certifications. This expertise directly supports Tenable's research mission and vulnerability intelligence. A top-of-band offer with a $140,000 RSU grant on NASDAQ: TENB would be commensurate with the research value I bring."

### Lever 3: Competing Offers from Security Leaders

> "I have offers from CrowdStrike and Mandiant at $195,000 base with strong equity packages. Tenable's mission of protecting the attack surface is deeply compelling, but I need total compensation to be competitive. An increase of $10,000 to the base and $20,000 to the RSU grant would close this gap."

### Lever 4: Clearance Premium & Signing Bonus

> "I hold an active security clearance, which is valuable for Tenable's government contracts and FedRAMP requirements. Combined with the $30,000 in unvested equity I'm leaving, a signing bonus of $25,000 reflects both the clearance premium and my transition costs."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $185,000 base (Columbia MD) / $180,000 (Austin) / £118,000 (London) with a request for $135,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $25,000 signing bonus. Reference a competing offer from CrowdStrike or Mandiant at $195,000 total comp. Your accept-at floor should be $155,000 base with $85,000 RSUs and a $12,000 sign-on — below this threshold, negotiate for a security research budget or additional RSUs.
