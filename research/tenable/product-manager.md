### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in the exposure management category — a recognition that places immense value on product strategy. This designation validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology and the product decisions that differentiated the platform from competitors.

As a Product Manager, you define the roadmap for **AI-powered** ExposureAI features and shape how the **Tenable One** unified platform evolves to sustain this market position. The Gartner recognition was earned by product decisions — and future dominance depends on the next generation of product leaders. Use this lever:

*"Gartner named Tenable the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026 — a recognition driven by product differentiation. As a Product Manager, my decisions on roadmap, feature prioritization, and go-to-market timing for Risk-Aware Exposure capabilities and AI-powered ExposureAI in Tenable One will directly determine whether Tenable holds this position. My compensation should reflect the strategic weight of this product leadership role."*

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Domain Expertise Premium

> "I bring deep cybersecurity product management experience from [current/previous company], including launching products in the vulnerability management and exposure assessment space. This domain expertise accelerates my ramp time and has a direct revenue impact — I'd like the base to reflect this at $180,000 with an RSU grant of $150,000 over 4 years."

### Lever 2: Competitive Product Leadership Offers

> "I have an active PM offer from CrowdStrike at $195,000 total comp with $140,000 in RSUs. Tenable's mission in exposure management is more compelling to me, but I need the compensation to be competitive. An increase of $15,000 to the base and $20,000 to the RSU grant would close this gap."

### Lever 3: Revenue Attribution & Product Impact

> "Product Managers at Tenable directly influence ARR growth through feature launches, pricing decisions, and competitive positioning. I expect to contribute to at least $10M in incremental ARR within my first 18 months. My compensation should reflect this revenue leverage — particularly the equity component on NASDAQ: TENB."

### Lever 4: Relocation & Market-Specific Adjustment

> "Relocating to [Columbia MD / Austin / London] involves meaningful transition costs. I'd like a signing bonus of $25,000 to cover relocation expenses and a cost-of-living adjustment of $8,000 to the base to ensure parity with local PM market rates."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $180,000 base (Columbia MD) / $175,000 (Austin) / £112,000 (London) with a request for $150,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $25,000 signing bonus. Reference a competing offer from CrowdStrike or Palo Alto Networks at $195,000 total comp. Your accept-at floor should be $155,000 base with $95,000 RSUs and a $15,000 sign-on — below this threshold, push for additional RSUs or annual bonus guarantee.
