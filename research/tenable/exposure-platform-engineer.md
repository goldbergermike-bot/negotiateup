### Exposure Platform Engineer | Tenable Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Tenable (NASDAQ: TENB) | Cybersecurity Exposure Management | RSU Equity (4-Year Vesting) | Columbia MD & Austin & London

---

## Role Overview: Tenable's Signature Engineering Position

The Exposure Platform Engineer is Tenable's most strategically critical engineering role — purpose-built to advance the company's category-defining exposure management platform. Unlike traditional software engineering roles, this position sits at the convergence of cybersecurity domain expertise, large-scale platform architecture, data engineering, and machine learning infrastructure. You are building the core platform that earned Tenable the Gartner "Company to Beat" designation and that powers the Risk-Aware Exposure methodology across the entire Tenable One ecosystem.

This is not a role that exists at most companies. It is uniquely Tenable's, and the compensation negotiation must reflect both its strategic importance and the difficulty of finding engineers who can operate at this intersection of skills.

| Total Year-1 Comp | $255,000 – $385,000 | $245,000 – $370,000 | £152,000 – £248,000 |

**Equity Note:** All RSU grants vest over 4 years on a standard schedule (typically 25% per year) and are priced on Tenable's NASDAQ: TENB ticker. RSUs are real shares — not options — eliminating strike-price risk. Exposure Platform Engineers are positioned for accelerated RSU refreshers due to the role's direct platform impact and high retention priority.

### Expanded Compensation Context

The Exposure Platform Engineer role commands premium compensation because it requires a rare combination of skills that few engineers possess:

| Skill Dimension | Why It Commands Premium |
|---|---|
| Platform Architecture | Designing systems that process billions of vulnerability data points daily |
| Cybersecurity Domain | Understanding CVEs, CVSS, attack paths, and exposure modeling |
| Data Infrastructure | Building real-time pipelines for risk aggregation and analysis |
| ML Integration | Integrating AI/ML models into production exposure scoring systems |
| Compliance Knowledge | Understanding FedRAMP, SOC2, and regulatory requirements at scale |

Because this role spans at least three traditional engineering disciplines, compensation should be benchmarked against the highest-paying comparable role, not averaged across them. Candidates should negotiate accordingly.

## Negotiation DNA

The Exposure Platform Engineer role is Tenable's crown jewel engineering position. You are not simply writing code — you are building the platform that defines an entire cybersecurity category. This is the system that ingests data from every Tenable sensor, applies the Risk-Aware Exposure methodology, powers ExposureAI's machine learning models, and delivers unified risk intelligence through Tenable One. Every customer, every analyst evaluation, and every competitive deal depends on the platform you build.

Tenable (NASDAQ: TENB) compensates Exposure Platform Engineers with premium RSU packages over 4-year vesting periods, recognizing that this role has an outsized impact on both product capability and competitive differentiation. The company's offices in Columbia MD (headquarters), Austin, and London each house platform engineering teams, and the role's strategic importance means compensation should be benchmarked against the top of Tenable's engineering bands — regardless of office location.

This is a role where you should negotiate aggressively. Tenable cannot afford to lose candidates who can operate at this intersection of platform engineering and cybersecurity expertise. The supply of qualified engineers is measured in dozens, not thousands.

**Level Mapping:** Exposure Platform Engineer at Tenable maps to IC3–IC5 Platform/Infrastructure Engineer at peer cybersecurity companies (CrowdStrike Senior Platform Engineer, Palo Alto Networks Principal Platform Engineer, Rapid7 Staff Platform Engineer) and L5–L6 Platform Engineer at FAANG-tier companies. The cybersecurity domain specialization adds a 10–20% premium over general platform engineering roles.

## Tenable's Exposure Management Leadership: The Strategic Context

Before entering compensation negotiation, you must understand why this role exists and why Tenable is investing disproportionately in exposure platform engineering:

### The Market Category Tenable Created

Tenable pioneered the exposure management category — moving the industry beyond reactive vulnerability scanning toward continuous, contextual, risk-aware assessment of the entire attack surface. This category creation is Tenable's primary strategic asset, and the exposure platform is the technology that makes it real.

### The Gartner Validation

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Gartner named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in exposure management. This is the highest form of analyst validation and places enormous pressure on Tenable to maintain platform leadership. Every engineering decision on the exposure platform now carries Gartner-validated weight.

### The Tenable One Unified Platform

**Tenable One** is the company's flagship unified exposure management platform, consolidating vulnerability management, web application security, cloud security, identity exposure, attack surface management, and OT/IoT security into a single pane of glass. As an Exposure Platform Engineer, you are building the connective tissue that makes this unification possible.

### The ExposureAI Engine

Tenable's **AI-powered** ExposureAI capabilities are the analytical brain of the platform. ExposureAI uses machine learning to predict breach likelihood, prioritize remediation actions, and automate security workflows. The Exposure Platform Engineer builds the infrastructure that ExposureAI runs on — the data pipelines, model serving infrastructure, and real-time scoring systems.

### The Risk-Aware Exposure Methodology

Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology is the intellectual framework that differentiates the platform. It goes beyond CVSS scores to incorporate business context, asset criticality, threat intelligence, and attack path analysis into a unified risk score. As an Exposure Platform Engineer, you implement this methodology in code.

### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in the exposure management category — the most significant analyst endorsement in Tenable's history. This designation validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology as the industry standard and places the exposure platform at the center of the company's competitive strategy.

As an Exposure Platform Engineer, you are the builder of the system that earned this recognition. Your platform integrates **AI-powered** ExposureAI capabilities — predictive risk scoring, automated remediation prioritization, and attack path analysis — into the **Tenable One** unified platform. Without the exposure platform, there is no Gartner recognition. Without you, there is no exposure platform.

This is the single most powerful negotiation lever available to any Tenable engineering candidate. Use it with precision and confidence:

*"Gartner named Tenable the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026 — the most significant analyst validation in the company's history. As an Exposure Platform Engineer, I'm not building a feature or a service — I'm building the platform that IS the product. The Risk-Aware Exposure methodology, the AI-powered ExposureAI engine, the Tenable One unified experience — all of it runs on the exposure platform I'll be engineering.*

*This role is the technical foundation of a Gartner-validated market leader. The number of engineers in the world who can operate at the intersection of large-scale platform architecture, cybersecurity domain expertise, and ML infrastructure is vanishingly small. My compensation needs to reflect three things: the strategic criticality of this platform, the scarcity of engineers who can build it, and the fact that Tenable's competitive position — and NASDAQ: TENB stock performance — depends on the work I'll be doing."*

### Advanced Lever Tactics for Exposure Platform Engineers

**Tactic 1: The "Gartner Defense" Frame**
Position your compensation as an investment in defending the Gartner designation. Tenable's competitors (Qualys, Rapid7, CrowdStrike, Wiz) are all investing heavily to dethrone the "Company to Beat." Every quarter that Tenable maintains this position is worth millions in enterprise deals. Your platform engineering directly defends this competitive moat.

**Tactic 2: The "Category Creation" Frame**
Remind the hiring team that Exposure Platform Engineer is a role Tenable created because no existing role captures the scope of this work. When a company creates a new role category, it should create a new compensation category to match — not fit it into existing engineering bands.

**Tactic 3: The "Platform = Product" Frame**
Unlike application engineers who build features, you are building the platform that IS the product. When customers buy Tenable One, they are buying your platform. This 1:1 correlation between your work and Tenable's revenue makes the role fundamentally different from — and more valuable than — standard engineering positions.

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Platform-Product Equivalence & Revenue Attribution

> "As an Exposure Platform Engineer, I'm not building a component of the product — I'm building the product itself. Tenable One IS the exposure platform. When customers pay for Tenable One, they are paying for the system I engineer. This 1:1 correlation between my platform work and Tenable's $800M+ ARR warrants a base of $210,000 and an RSU grant of $210,000 over 4 years. I've benchmarked this against CrowdStrike Principal Platform Engineer and Palo Alto Networks Staff Platform Engineer compensation, and my ask is within the competitive range for platform engineers at Gartner-leading cybersecurity companies."

### Lever 2: Cybersecurity-Platform Engineering Scarcity

> "Engineers who combine large-scale platform architecture expertise with deep cybersecurity domain knowledge — understanding CVEs, attack paths, exposure modeling, and risk quantification — are extraordinarily rare. I've been recruited by CrowdStrike, Wiz, and Google's security infrastructure team with total compensation packages ranging from $350,000 to $420,000. Tenable's exposure management mission is uniquely compelling, but the RSU grant on NASDAQ: TENB needs to reflect the market reality for this skillset. I'm requesting $200,000 in RSUs over 4 years with consideration for a front-loaded vesting schedule."

### Lever 3: ExposureAI Infrastructure Premium

> "The ExposureAI engine is Tenable's most important competitive differentiator, and I'll be building the ML infrastructure — model serving, feature stores, real-time scoring pipelines — that makes it work at scale. This ML-infrastructure specialization commands a premium above standard platform engineering. I'd like an additional $15,000 on the base and $25,000 in RSUs to reflect the AI-infrastructure expertise I bring, which eliminates the need to hire separately for this capability."

### Lever 4: Signing Bonus, Equity Bridge & Career Risk Offset

> "I'm leaving $65,000 in unvested RSUs at my current employer and passing on a promotion to Principal Engineer. Additionally, joining as an Exposure Platform Engineer — a role that's unique to Tenable — carries career specialization risk. If I leave Tenable, this title doesn't map directly to roles at other companies. A signing bonus of $38,000 plus a guaranteed Year-2 RSU refresher of $50,000 would offset both the unvested equity gap and the career-path risk, while demonstrating Tenable's conviction in my long-term impact on the platform."

## Additional Negotiation Strategies for the Signature Role

### The "Three Offers" Approach

At the Exposure Platform Engineer level, you should have at least three competing offers to create maximum leverage:

1. **A FAANG platform engineering role** (Google L5/L6, Meta E5/E6) — establishes a total comp ceiling of $380,000–$450,000
2. **A peer cybersecurity company** (CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks) — provides domain-specific benchmarking
3. **A high-growth security startup** (Wiz, Orca Security) — demonstrates risk tolerance and equity upside appetite

Use all three in your negotiation with Tenable, but emphasize that Tenable's exposure management mission is your first choice if the compensation is competitive.

### The "Platform Equity" Argument

As the engineer building the core platform, argue that your RSU grant should be correlated with platform revenue. If Tenable One generates $500M+ in ARR and growing, your RSU grant should reflect a meaningful fraction of the value your platform creates. This is not about being greedy — it's about aligning incentives between the platform builder and the platform's commercial success.

### The "Retention Math" Play

Calculate the cost of losing an Exposure Platform Engineer after 18 months: 6 months to backfill, 6 months to ramp, $200,000+ in recruiter fees and lost productivity. Present this math to the hiring manager and VP of Engineering as justification for a top-of-band offer that minimizes attrition risk.

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $210,000 base (Columbia MD) / $205,000 (Austin) / £135,000 (London) with a request for $210,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years, a $38,000 signing bonus, and a guaranteed Year-2 RSU refresher of $50,000. Reference three competing offers: a Google L6 Platform role at $420,000 total comp, a CrowdStrike Principal Platform Engineer at $380,000, and a Wiz Staff Engineer at $400,000 with pre-IPO equity. Emphasize that Tenable's exposure management mission is your top choice. Your accept-at floor should be $180,000 base with $150,000 RSUs, a $18,000 signing bonus, and verbal commitment to a Year-2 refresher — below this threshold, walk to a competing offer. Do not accept below the floor under any circumstances; the scarcity of your skillset means another offer will come.

## Role-Specific Negotiation Timeline

| Phase | Timing | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Initial Offer | Day 0 | Receive offer, express enthusiasm, request 5 business days to evaluate |
| Research Phase | Days 1–2 | Benchmark against Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and competing offers |
| Counter-Offer | Day 3 | Submit written counter with all 4 levers and specific $ amounts |
| Negotiation Call | Day 4 | 30-minute call with recruiter; escalate to hiring manager if needed |
| Final Decision | Day 5 | Accept if at or above floor; request VP escalation if below |

### What to Say If They Push Back

If the recruiter says "this is our best offer," respond:

*"I appreciate the transparency. I want to be at Tenable — the Gartner 'Company to Beat' recognition, the Risk-Aware Exposure methodology, and the ExposureAI vision are exactly what I want to build. But the offer is below market for platform engineers with my cybersecurity expertise. Can we escalate to the VP of Engineering? I'd like to discuss how we can structure the RSU grant or signing bonus to close the gap, because I don't want compensation to be the reason this doesn't happen."*
