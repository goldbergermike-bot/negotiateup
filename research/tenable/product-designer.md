### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in the exposure management category — and product design plays a critical role in sustaining that position. The designation validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology, but it's the user experience that translates risk data into actionable intelligence for security teams.

As a Product Designer, you are designing the interfaces for **AI-powered** ExposureAI capabilities within the **Tenable One** unified platform. Your design decisions determine how security professionals interact with risk-aware insights — making design a strategic differentiator. Use this lever:

*"Gartner named Tenable the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026, and a key reason is the platform's ability to make Risk-Aware Exposure data actionable through design. As a Product Designer, my work on the AI-powered ExposureAI interfaces within Tenable One directly impacts user adoption and customer satisfaction. I'd like my compensation to reflect the strategic importance of design to Tenable's market position."*

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Cybersecurity Design Specialization

> "Designing for cybersecurity is a specialized skill — translating complex exposure data into clear, actionable UX requires deep domain knowledge. I bring this expertise from [current role], and it reduces my ramp time from 6 months to 6 weeks. I'd like a base of $160,000 with an RSU grant of $100,000 over 4 years to reflect this specialization premium."

### Lever 2: Portfolio Impact & Revenue Correlation

> "My design work at [previous company] led to a 30% increase in feature adoption and a measurable reduction in churn. At Tenable, this translates to direct ARR impact. I'd like the equity component on NASDAQ: TENB to reflect this revenue correlation — an increase from $70,000 to $100,000 in RSUs."

### Lever 3: Competing Offers from Tech & Cybersecurity Companies

> "I have an offer from a FAANG company at $170,000 base with $120,000 in RSUs. While Tenable's mission is more aligned with my interests, I need the total compensation to be within 10% of competing offers. An additional $10,000 to the base and $15,000 to the RSU grant would close this gap."

### Lever 4: Signing Bonus for Transition Costs

> "I'm walking away from $20,000 in unvested equity and a pending promotion. A signing bonus of $18,000 would bridge this transition cost and allow me to commit to Tenable without financial hesitation."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $160,000 base (Columbia MD) / $155,000 (Austin) / £97,000 (London) with a request for $100,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $18,000 signing bonus. Reference a competing offer from a FAANG or CrowdStrike at $170,000 base. Your accept-at floor should be $140,000 base with $65,000 RSUs and a $10,000 sign-on — below this threshold, negotiate for a guaranteed first-year RSU refresher or walk.
