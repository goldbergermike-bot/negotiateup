### Staff Software Engineer | Tenable Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Tenable (NASDAQ: TENB) | Cybersecurity Exposure Management | RSU Equity (4-Year Vesting) | Columbia MD & Austin & London

## Compensation Benchmarks by Region

| Component | Columbia MD (USD) | Austin (USD) | London (GBP £) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base Salary | $190,000 – $235,000 | $185,000 – $230,000 | £120,000 – £155,000 |
| Annual Bonus | 15–20% target | 15–20% target | 15–20% target |
| RSU Grant (4-Year Vest) | $150,000 – $280,000 | $140,000 – $270,000 | £95,000 – £175,000 |
| Signing Bonus | $25,000 – $50,000 | $25,000 – $50,000 | £15,000 – £30,000 |
| Total Year-1 Comp | $290,000 – $420,000 | $280,000 – $405,000 | £185,000 – £275,000 |

**Equity Note:** All RSU grants vest over 4 years on a standard schedule (typically 25% per year) and are priced on Tenable's NASDAQ: TENB ticker. RSUs are real shares — not options — eliminating strike-price risk. At the Staff level, annual RSU refreshers become a significant component of ongoing compensation.

## Negotiation DNA

Staff Software Engineers at Tenable operate as technical multipliers — they set architectural direction, mentor senior engineers, and make cross-team technical decisions that shape the exposure management platform. At this level, Tenable (NASDAQ: TENB) offers its most competitive RSU packages with 4-year vesting, often supplemented by meaningful annual refreshers. The Staff role is critical across all three offices — Columbia MD (HQ), Austin, and London — and candidates at this level have significant leverage due to the scarcity of staff-caliber cybersecurity engineers.

**Level Mapping:** Staff Software Engineer at Tenable maps to IC4/L5 equivalent at peer cybersecurity companies (CrowdStrike Staff Engineer, Palo Alto Networks Principal SDE) and L6 at FAANG-tier companies (Google L6, Meta E6).

### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in the exposure management space — a designation reserved for the undisputed market leader. This recognition validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology, which has redefined how organizations understand, prioritize, and remediate cyber risk across their attack surfaces.

As a Staff Software Engineer, you are the architect behind the **AI-powered** ExposureAI engine and the technical vision driving the **Tenable One** unified platform's evolution. Gartner's recognition puts Tenable in a category-defining position — and your compensation should reflect the outsized impact staff-level engineers have on maintaining that lead. Use this lever:

*"Gartner named Tenable the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026, which signals that this is the defining moment for Tenable's platform architecture. At the Staff level, my decisions on system design and Risk-Aware Exposure infrastructure will directly determine whether Tenable One and its AI-powered ExposureAI capabilities maintain this market lead. I need my total compensation — especially the RSU grant — to reflect the magnitude of this technical leadership role."*

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Staff-Level Scarcity & FAANG Counter-Offers

> "At the Staff level, I have active interest from Google, CrowdStrike, and Palo Alto Networks with total compensation packages exceeding $380,000. Tenable's mission is compelling, but I need the RSU grant to close the equity gap — an increase from $200,000 to $260,000 in RSUs over 4 years would make this competitive."

### Lever 2: Architectural Impact on Revenue-Critical Systems

> "As a Staff engineer, I'll be making architectural decisions that directly impact Tenable One's platform reliability, scalability, and ExposureAI performance — systems that drive Tenable's $800M+ ARR. This level of impact warrants a base salary at the top of band, at $230,000, with a commensurate RSU package."

### Lever 3: Geographic Flexibility as Leverage

> "I'm evaluating Tenable roles across Columbia MD, Austin, and London. The Austin offer from a competitor comes with a lower cost of living but comparable base. I'd like Tenable to match the most competitive offer regardless of office, given that Staff engineers contribute at the same level across locations."

### Lever 4: Retention Alignment via Signing Bonus & RSU Structure

> "I'm leaving $80,000 in unvested equity at my current employer. A $45,000 signing bonus combined with a front-loaded RSU vesting schedule would demonstrate Tenable's commitment to retaining staff-level talent and offset the transition cost."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $228,000 base (Columbia MD) / $222,000 (Austin) / £150,000 (London) with a request for $260,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $45,000 signing bonus. Reference competing offers from Google L6 or CrowdStrike Staff at $400,000+ total comp. Your accept-at floor should be $200,000 base with $175,000 RSUs and a $25,000 sign-on — below this threshold, escalate to the VP of Engineering or walk.
