## Compensation Benchmarks by Region

| Component | Columbia MD (USD) | Austin (USD) | London (GBP £) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base Salary | $160,000 – $210,000 | $155,000 – $205,000 | £95,000 – £135,000 |
| Annual Bonus | 12–18% target | 12–18% target | 12–18% target |

**Equity Note:** All RSU grants vest over 4 years on a standard schedule (typically 25% per year) and are priced on Tenable's NASDAQ: TENB ticker. RSUs are real shares — not options — eliminating strike-price risk. ML/AI Engineers may receive accelerated refreshers tied to ExposureAI product milestones.

## Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at Tenable build the machine learning models and AI systems that power ExposureAI — the intelligence engine at the heart of Tenable's exposure management platform. This role sits at the most competitive intersection in tech hiring: applied ML engineering with cybersecurity domain relevance. Tenable (NASDAQ: TENB) offers premium RSU packages with 4-year vesting for ML/AI talent, reflecting both the extreme scarcity of these engineers and the strategic importance of AI capabilities to the platform's competitive moat. Across Columbia MD, Austin, and London, ML/AI engineers with security domain expertise are among the hardest roles to fill in cybersecurity.

**Level Mapping:** ML/AI Engineer at Tenable maps to IC3–IC4 Applied ML Engineer at peer cybersecurity companies (CrowdStrike ML Engineer, Palo Alto Networks Applied AI Engineer) and L5 ML Engineer at FAANG-tier companies (Google Brain, Meta FAIR).

### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in exposure management — and AI capabilities were a decisive factor in that designation. This recognition validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology, with machine learning models providing the predictive intelligence that differentiates Tenable from legacy scanners.

As an ML/AI Engineer, you are building the **AI-powered** ExposureAI engine that is the intellectual core of the **Tenable One** unified platform. Your models predict breach likelihood, prioritize vulnerabilities by business context, and automate security workflows. The Gartner recognition is a direct testament to your team's work. Use this lever:

*"Gartner named Tenable the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026, and ExposureAI — the system I'll be building — was a key differentiator in that recognition. As an ML/AI Engineer, my models power the Risk-Aware Exposure methodology that makes Tenable One's AI-powered capabilities the market standard. ML/AI talent is the most competitive hire in cybersecurity right now, and my compensation should reflect both the scarcity of this skillset and the strategic importance of ExposureAI to Tenable's market position."*

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: ML/AI Talent Scarcity Premium

> "Applied ML/AI engineers with production model deployment experience are the hardest role to fill in cybersecurity. I have competing offers from Google Brain and CrowdStrike at $220,000+ base with $200,000+ in equity. Tenable's ExposureAI mission is compelling, but I need the compensation to reflect the extreme scarcity of this talent — a base of $205,000 with $190,000 in RSUs over 4 years."

### Lever 2: ExposureAI Strategic Impact

> "ExposureAI is the feature that earned Tenable the Gartner 'Company to Beat' designation. My ML models will directly power the predictive capabilities that differentiate Tenable One. This isn't backend infrastructure — it's the product itself. The RSU grant on NASDAQ: TENB should reflect this direct product-market impact with a top-of-band allocation of $195,000."

### Lever 3: Publication Record & Research Credentials

> "I have [X] published papers in NeurIPS/ICML/security ML conferences and a track record of deploying research-grade models into production systems. This research credibility enhances Tenable's brand in the AI/security community. I'd like a research publication stipend and a $15,000 premium on the base to reflect this academic-to-industry value."

### Lever 4: Signing Bonus & Equity Bridge

> "I'm leaving $50,000 in unvested RSUs at my current employer plus an active research role. A signing bonus of $35,000 would offset this transition cost and demonstrate Tenable's commitment to building a world-class ML/AI team."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $205,000 base (Columbia MD) / $200,000 (Austin) / £132,000 (London) with a request for $190,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $35,000 signing bonus. Reference competing offers from Google Brain or CrowdStrike at $220,000 base plus $200,000 equity. Your accept-at floor should be $170,000 base with $120,000 RSUs and a $18,000 sign-on — below this threshold, walk to a competing offer or escalate to VP of Engineering.
