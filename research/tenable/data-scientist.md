### 🎯 Tenable 'Company to Beat' & Risk-Aware Exposure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, **Gartner** named Tenable the **"Company to Beat"** in exposure management — a designation driven in large part by the analytical sophistication of Tenable's risk models. This recognition validates Tenable's **Risk-Aware Exposure** methodology, which relies on data science to contextualize and prioritize vulnerabilities across millions of assets.

As a Data Scientist, your models directly power the **AI-powered** ExposureAI engine that drives predictive risk scoring within the **Tenable One** unified platform. Your statistical and ML expertise is the intellectual property that sustains Tenable's analytical advantage. Use this lever:

*"Gartner named Tenable the 'Company to Beat' on February 12, 2026, and a core reason is the analytical depth behind Risk-Aware Exposure methodology. As a Data Scientist, my work on predictive models and AI-powered ExposureAI capabilities within Tenable One directly drives the analytical differentiation that earned this recognition. My compensation should reflect the premium for data scientists who can operate at this intersection of security and advanced analytics."*

## 4 Global Levers for Negotiation

### Lever 1: Cybersecurity Data Science Scarcity

> "Data scientists with cybersecurity domain expertise are exceptionally rare. I bring both advanced ML skills and experience building risk models in security contexts. This combination commands a premium — I'd like a base of $175,000 with a $130,000 RSU grant over 4 years to reflect the scarcity of this skillset."

### Lever 2: Model Impact on Product Differentiation

> "The risk scoring models I'll build directly impact Tenable One's competitive positioning. My previous models at [current company] improved detection accuracy by 25% and reduced false positives by 40%. This level of model impact on NASDAQ: TENB stock performance warrants a top-of-band RSU grant."

### Lever 3: Competing Offers from ML-Heavy Companies

> "I have offers from Google Brain and CrowdStrike's data science team at $190,000+ base with $150,000+ in equity. Tenable's mission in exposure management is compelling, but I need the total compensation to reflect the market rate for applied ML scientists with security experience."

### Lever 4: Signing Bonus & Research Transition Costs

> "I'm transitioning from a role where I have $35,000 in unvested equity and an active research publication pipeline. A $22,000 signing bonus would offset the financial cost of this transition and signal Tenable's commitment to investing in data science talent."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $175,000 base (Columbia MD) / $170,000 (Austin) / £107,000 (London) with a request for $130,000 in RSUs (NASDAQ: TENB) over 4 years and a $22,000 signing bonus. Reference a competing offer from CrowdStrike or Google at $190,000 base plus equity. Your accept-at floor should be $150,000 base with $85,000 RSUs and a $12,000 sign-on — below this threshold, push for a guaranteed first-year refresher grant or walk.
