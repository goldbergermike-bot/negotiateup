**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Fiserv protect one of the largest payment processing ecosystems in the world. With 6M+ merchant locations on the Clover OS platform and billions of dollars in transactions flowing through the system daily, security is not a feature — it is a regulatory requirement, a fiduciary obligation, and a business survival imperative. At 12% Clover growth, the attack surface is expanding rapidly, and Fiserv needs Security Engineers who can scale security controls, threat detection, and compliance frameworks at the pace of platform growth.

Fiserv's $20B+ revenue depends on maintaining PCI DSS compliance, SOC 2 attestation, and regulatory approval across every market it operates in. A security breach on Clover OS would not only cost hundreds of millions in direct losses but would undermine the SMB Operating Platform trust that Fiserv's entire growth narrative depends on. This existential risk profile is why Fiserv offers High-Margin SaaS pay bands for security talent — the cost of underpaying for security and losing top talent to competitors is measured in potential catastrophic losses.

Your negotiation leverage is among the strongest of any technical role at Fiserv. Security engineers with payments and PCI compliance expertise are in extreme demand across fintech, and the consequences of unfilled security positions are uniquely severe in a company handling financial transactions.

### Clover OS — The High-Margin SaaS Premium

**Lever 1 — Existential Risk Protection:** "Clover OS processes financial transactions for 6M+ merchant locations. A security breach doesn't just cost money — it destroys the trust that the entire SMB Operating Platform depends on. As a Security Engineer, I'm protecting Fiserv's most valuable asset: merchant trust. At 12% Clover growth, the expanding attack surface makes my role more critical every quarter. My compensation should reflect the existential risk I'm mitigating."

**Lever 2 — Compliance-as-Revenue-Enabler:** "PCI DSS compliance, SOC 2, and regulatory approvals are not just checkboxes — they are revenue prerequisites. Without my work maintaining and extending Fiserv's compliance posture, the Clover OS platform cannot operate. I'm asking for High-Margin SaaS pay bands because my security and compliance work directly enables every dollar of revenue Fiserv generates through the SMB Operating Platform."

**Lever 3 — Payments Security Scarcity:** "Security engineers with deep payments security experience — PCI DSS, tokenization, encryption-at-rest, real-time fraud detection — are among the scarcest talent in tech. Fiserv is competing for this talent against every major bank, payment processor, and fintech company. My competing offers reflect this scarcity premium, and I'd like Fiserv to match the market for payments-grade security expertise."

**Lever 4 — Platform Growth Security Scaling:** "At 12% Clover growth, the Clover OS attack surface is expanding faster than most companies' total surface. Every new merchant, every new app in the marketplace, every new integration point creates new security considerations. I'll be building the security architecture that scales with the SMB Operating Platform growth, and my RSU grant should reflect the compounding value of security infrastructure I build today."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $195,000 base in Brookfield or $230,000 in New York. Target RSUs of $140,000-$210,000 (4yr vest) by anchoring on the existential risk protection that security provides to the Clover OS ecosystem. Your accept-at floor should be $165,000 base / $110,000 RSU in Brookfield or $195,000 base / $140,000 RSU in New York. Push for security certifications budget (CISSP, OSCP, etc.) and conference attendance as non-comp levers. Negotiate sign-on bonus of $25,000-$40,000 if RSUs are below target. Frame the entire conversation around High-Margin SaaS pay bands and the 12% Clover growth that requires scaling security across 6M+ merchant locations on the SMB Operating Platform.
