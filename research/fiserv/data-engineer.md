**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Fiserv build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers one of the largest merchant transaction ecosystems in the world. With 6M+ merchant locations on the Clover OS platform generating billions of transactions, the data engineering challenge at Fiserv is massive: real-time streaming pipelines, data warehouse architecture, ETL/ELT workflows, and data governance frameworks that must meet both performance demands and financial regulatory requirements. At 12% Clover growth, the data volume is increasing exponentially, and Fiserv needs Data Engineers who can scale the infrastructure to match.

The SMB Operating Platform vision depends fundamentally on data infrastructure. Every merchant insight, every analytics dashboard, every ML model, and every compliance report runs on the pipelines that Data Engineers build and maintain. Fiserv's $20B+ revenue generates a data asset that is only as valuable as the infrastructure that makes it accessible, reliable, and timely. The company has adopted High-Margin SaaS pay bands for Data Engineers because the alternative — slow, unreliable data infrastructure — undermines every data-dependent product and decision across the Clover OS ecosystem.

Your negotiation leverage comes from the foundational nature of data engineering. Without robust data pipelines, the data scientists cannot model, the product managers cannot measure, and the executives cannot report. You are the critical infrastructure layer beneath every data-driven function at Fiserv.

### Clover OS — The High-Margin SaaS Premium

**Lever 1 — Transaction Data Pipeline Scale:** "Clover OS generates transaction data across 6M+ merchant locations in real time. The data pipelines I build will process this volume with financial-grade reliability — latency, accuracy, and compliance requirements that most SaaS companies never encounter. At 12% Clover growth, the data volume is scaling rapidly, and my infrastructure work directly enables the SMB Operating Platform's data-driven capabilities. My compensation should reflect this critical infrastructure role."

**Lever 2 — Data Foundation for Platform Intelligence:** "Every data product at Fiserv — merchant analytics, fraud detection, pricing optimization, compliance reporting — depends on the pipelines and data warehouse architecture I build. As a Data Engineer on the Clover OS ecosystem, I'm the foundation that makes all other data-dependent functions possible. My RSU grant should reflect this foundational leverage, not just the individual scope of pipeline work."

**Lever 3 — Real-Time Payments Data Expertise:** "Building real-time data pipelines for payment processing is a specialized skill. The combination of low-latency requirements, financial accuracy standards, PCI compliance for data handling, and the scale of 6M+ merchants creates a complexity profile that commands High-Margin SaaS pay bands. My competing offers from Stripe and Square reflect the market rate for this payments data engineering expertise."

**Lever 4 — Data Governance and Compliance Enablement:** "Fiserv operates in a heavily regulated industry. The data infrastructure I build must support regulatory reporting, audit trails, and data governance frameworks across every market. This compliance enablement work is invisible to users but existential for the business — without it, the SMB Operating Platform cannot operate. My total comp should reflect the regulatory risk I'm managing through proper data architecture."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $180,000 base in Brookfield or $210,000 in New York. Target RSUs of $110,000-$175,000 (4yr vest) by anchoring on the foundational nature of data engineering to every data-dependent product in the Clover OS ecosystem. Your accept-at floor should be $150,000 base / $80,000 RSU in Brookfield or $175,000 base / $110,000 RSU in New York. Push for cloud compute and data tool budget as non-comp levers. Negotiate sign-on bonus of $15,000-$30,000 if RSUs are below target. Frame everything around High-Margin SaaS pay bands and the 12% Clover growth that is scaling data volume across the SMB Operating Platform's 6M+ merchant locations.
