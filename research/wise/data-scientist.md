### Data Scientist — Wise Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Wise's Mid-Market Infrastructure strategy, translating the LSE public status (LSE: WISE) and industry-leading 4.3 Trustpilot rating into a data science compensation framework spanning London, Tallinn, and Singapore markets. As a Data Scientist at Wise, you build the analytical models that sustain Platform Integrity — pricing optimization, fraud detection, FX risk modeling, and the data-driven decisions that keep Wise's mid-market infrastructure transparent, efficient, and trustworthy for the Wise Platform API ecosystem.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £65,000 – £95,000 | £30,000 – £60,000 | £95,000 – £155,000 |
| Tallinn (EUR) | €50,000 – €72,000 | €22,000 – €45,000 | €72,000 – €117,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$85,000 – S$125,000 | S$38,000 – S$70,000 | S$123,000 – S$195,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Scientists at Wise work on some of the most impactful problems in fintech: pricing optimization across 50+ currencies, fraud detection protecting billions in monthly volume, and FX risk modeling that manages real-time currency exposure. Your models directly influence Wise's ability to maintain mid-market rate transparency — the foundation of the 4.3 Trustpilot rating. RSU grants vest over 4 years on LSE: WISE, giving you liquid equity tied to the analytical leverage your models deliver. A 0.01% improvement in fee efficiency at Wise's volume translates to millions in customer savings and competitive advantage.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Wise Level | Revolut Equivalent | Monzo Equivalent | Airwallex Equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Data Scientist (DS2) | Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Scientist |
| Senior DS (DS3) | Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist |

Wise DS compensation is competitive with Monzo and close to Revolut when RSU liquidity is factored in. The key differentiator is the direct financial impact of DS work at Wise — your models influence pricing, risk, and fraud across a publicly traded company's P&L, with measurable impact on LSE: WISE share price.

#### 🏗️ Wise Mid-Market Infrastructure & Platform Integrity Lever

**LSE Public Status**: Wise's LSE listing (LSE: WISE) means your pricing, fraud, and risk models have direct visibility to public market investors. When your pricing optimization reduces costs or your fraud models prevent losses, the impact flows through to quarterly earnings and share price. Your RSU grants are liquid equity tied to the analytical value you create — negotiate them accordingly.

**4.3 Trustpilot Rating**: Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating depends on the accuracy and fairness of pricing models, the effectiveness of fraud detection (false positive minimization), and the consistency of the customer experience — all data science outcomes. Position yourself as the analytical engine behind the trust metric that defines Wise's competitive moat.

**Platform Integrity Positioning**: Data Scientists at Wise are Platform Integrity quantifiers. Your pricing models determine whether every transaction delivers the mid-market rate promise. Your fraud models protect the platform without creating friction. Your analytics inform product decisions that sustain transparency. You are the quantitative backbone of Wise's integrity promise.

**Wise Platform API**: The Wise Platform API's enterprise adoption depends on reliable pricing, risk management, and fraud detection at scale. Data Scientists who build models that serve both B2C and B2B contexts — handling partner bank volume alongside direct consumer transfers — deliver outsized strategic value that should be reflected in compensation.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Pricing Model Financial Impact**
> "I'll own pricing optimization models that directly determine Wise's fee structure for 16+ million customers across 80+ countries. A 0.01% improvement in fee efficiency at Wise's volume translates to millions in impact. My compensation should reflect this direct financial leverage, particularly the RSU component on LSE: WISE, which ties my equity to the pricing outcomes I drive."

**Lever 2 — Fraud Detection ROI**
> "Fraud detection models at Wise protect billions in monthly transaction volume. Every false negative is a direct financial loss; every false positive is a lost customer. My models sustain the Platform Integrity that produces Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect the asymmetric value of fraud prevention at this scale."

**Lever 3 — Wise Platform API Analytical Infrastructure**
> "The Wise Platform API requires pricing and risk models that serve both B2C and B2B contexts. This dual-context analytical scope is significantly more complex than single-product data science. I'd like a scope adjustment reflecting the Wise Platform API's enterprise data science requirements."

**Lever 4 — DS Talent Market Premium**
> "Data scientists with experience in FX pricing, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance across multiple currencies and jurisdictions are exceptionally scarce. I'm evaluating opportunities at quant firms, Big Tech, and fintech competitors across London, Tallinn, and Singapore. I'd like a package that positions Wise competitively against these alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 70th percentile of the compensation band. For London, push for £85,000 base + £50,000 RSU (4yr) = £135,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: £70,000 base + £35,000 RSU = £105,000 total. For Tallinn, target €65,000 base + €38,000 RSU = €103,000 total. For Singapore, target S$110,000 base + S$60,000 RSU = S$170,000 total. Data Scientists should negotiate for model ownership scope — pricing, fraud, or FX risk model ownership justifies higher compensation due to direct P&L impact. Push for RSU grants reflecting the financial leverage of your analytical work on LSE: WISE.
