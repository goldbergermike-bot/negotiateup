#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £90,000 – £130,000 | £50,000 – £120,000 | £140,000 – £250,000 |
| Tallinn (EUR) | €70,000 – €100,000 | €40,000 – €90,000 | €110,000 – €190,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$120,000 – S$170,000 | S$65,000 – S$140,000 | S$185,000 – S$310,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering Managers at Wise own the intersection of people, process, and Platform Integrity. Your RSU grants vest over 4 years on LSE: WISE — liquid, publicly valued equity. The 4.3 Trustpilot rating is sustained not just by code but by the teams you build, the engineering culture you foster, and the delivery cadence you maintain. Wise's flat, autonomous team structure means EMs have significant scope — you're not just managing up, you're setting technical direction and owning business outcomes.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Wise Level | Revolut Equivalent | Monzo Equivalent | Airwallex Equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager |
| Senior EM | Senior EM / Director | Head of Engineering | Senior EM |

Wise's EM compensation is competitive with Monzo and approaches Revolut at the senior EM level. The key differentiator is RSU liquidity — Wise's public equity on LSE makes the total comp more reliable than Revolut's private stock. Wise's autonomous team culture also means EMs have broader scope and decision-making authority than equivalents at more hierarchical fintechs.

#### 🏗️ Wise Mid-Market Infrastructure & Platform Integrity Lever

**LSE Public Status**: Wise's LSE listing (LSE: WISE) provides Engineering Managers with liquid equity that can be precisely valued and compared against competing offers. At the EM level, RSU grants of £50,000-£120,000 over 4 years are significant. Negotiate for the upper range by framing your team's output as directly connected to Platform Integrity metrics and enterprise revenue.

**4.3 Trustpilot Rating**: As an Engineering Manager, you own team delivery quality, reliability practices, and the engineering culture that produces Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating. This metric is a boardroom-level KPI. Frame your management impact as directly sustaining the trust moat that differentiates Wise from every competitor in financial services.

**Platform Integrity Positioning**: Engineering Managers at Wise are Platform Integrity leaders. You define team charters around reliability, security, and transparent system design. You hire, develop, and retain the engineers who build the mid-market infrastructure. Your leadership directly determines whether Wise can sustain its transparency promise at scale — across new markets, new products, and new enterprise partners.

**Wise Platform API**: EMs overseeing Wise Platform API teams lead some of the highest-impact work in the company — B2B revenue growth through enterprise partner integrations. Managing these teams means balancing partner SLAs, API reliability, and scalability with team health and delivery velocity. This is strategic leadership with direct revenue attribution.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Team Impact on Platform Integrity**
> "I'll lead a team whose output directly sustains Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating and Platform Integrity metrics. Engineering management at Wise isn't administrative — it's owning the people, processes, and delivery culture that produce system reliability at scale. My compensation should reflect this direct connection between my leadership and Wise's competitive trust moat."

**Lever 2 — LSE Public Equity Optimization**
> "I'd like to maximize the RSU component of my package. Wise's LSE listing means my equity is liquid and transparent — I can model its value precisely. I'm looking for an RSU grant that reflects the 70th percentile for engineering management at a public fintech platform, with annual refresh commitments tied to team performance outcomes."

**Lever 3 — Wise Platform API Team Leadership**
> "If I'm leading teams contributing to the Wise Platform API, I'm directly managing B2B revenue growth — one of Wise's most strategic priorities. This is not standard EM scope; it's enterprise-critical leadership with direct revenue attribution. I'd like my package to reflect the strategic weight of this team assignment."

**Lever 4 — Management Talent Scarcity**
> "Experienced engineering managers who combine deep technical credibility with people leadership in regulated fintech are exceptionally scarce. I'm evaluating EM roles at public fintechs, Big Tech, and traditional banks. Wise's mission and culture are compelling — I'd like a compensation package that removes financial friction from my decision."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 70th percentile of the compensation band. For London, push for £115,000 base + £100,000 RSU (4yr) = £215,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: £95,000 base + £60,000 RSU = £155,000 total. For Tallinn, target €90,000 base + €75,000 RSU = €165,000 total. For Singapore, target S$150,000 base + S$120,000 RSU = S$270,000 total. EMs should negotiate team scope as a lever — larger team size or more strategic team assignments (e.g., Wise Platform API) justify higher compensation. Push for sign-on RSU grants if transitioning from a senior IC or EM role at a competitor.
