### ML/AI Engineer — Wise Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Wise's Mid-Market Infrastructure strategy, translating the LSE public status (LSE: WISE) and industry-leading 4.3 Trustpilot rating into an ML/AI engineering compensation framework spanning London, Tallinn, and Singapore markets. As an ML/AI Engineer at Wise, you build the intelligent layer of Platform Integrity — the fraud detection models, dynamic pricing algorithms, FX risk management systems, and customer intelligence that make Wise's mid-market infrastructure transparent, efficient, and trustworthy at scale for the Wise Platform API ecosystem.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £80,000 – £120,000 | £40,000 – £85,000 | £120,000 – £205,000 |
| Tallinn (EUR) | €62,000 – €92,000 | €30,000 – €65,000 | €92,000 – €157,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$105,000 – S$160,000 | S$50,000 – S$100,000 | S$155,000 – S$260,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers at Wise solve some of the most impactful machine learning problems in fintech. Your fraud detection models protect billions in monthly transaction volume. Your dynamic pricing algorithms determine whether Wise can offer the mid-market rate across 50+ currencies while maintaining margins. Your FX risk models manage exposure in real time. At a public company listed on LSE: WISE with a 4.3 Trustpilot rating, your ML systems directly influence the P&L. RSU grants vest over 4 years on liquid equity — your models sustain the Platform Integrity that drives share price. ML talent at the intersection of production systems and financial infrastructure is among the scarcest in the market.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Wise Level | Revolut Equivalent | Monzo Equivalent | Airwallex Equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| ML/AI Engineer (IC3) | ML Engineer | ML Engineer | ML Engineer |
| Senior ML/AI (IC4) | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer |
| Staff ML/AI (IC5) | Staff ML Engineer | Staff ML Engineer | Principal ML Engineer |

Wise ML compensation is increasingly competitive, particularly at senior and staff levels where RSU liquidity on LSE: WISE narrows the gap with Big Tech. The financial domain complexity (FX, fraud, pricing, compliance) and production-critical nature of ML at Wise command a premium over generic ML roles.

#### 🏗️ Wise Mid-Market Infrastructure & Platform Integrity Lever

**LSE Public Status**: Wise's LSE listing (LSE: WISE) means your ML models have direct P&L and share price impact. When your fraud models prevent losses, your pricing algorithms optimize margins, or your FX risk models manage exposure, the financial impact flows through to quarterly earnings. Your RSU grants are liquid equity directly tied to the model performance you deliver.

**4.3 Trustpilot Rating**: Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot score depends on accurate pricing (no hidden fees), effective fraud detection (minimal false positives disrupting customers), and consistent service quality — all ML-driven outcomes. Your models produce the trust that sustains this industry-leading rating. Frame your ML work as the intelligent engine behind Platform Integrity.

**Platform Integrity Positioning**: ML/AI Engineers at Wise are Platform Integrity optimizers. Your pricing models ensure every transaction delivers the mid-market rate promise. Your fraud models protect the platform without creating customer friction. Your FX risk models manage currency exposure transparently. You are the quantitative intelligence that makes Wise's transparency promise sustainable at scale.

**Wise Platform API**: The Wise Platform API's enterprise adoption depends on reliable pricing, fraud detection, and risk management at scale. ML models that serve both B2C and B2B contexts — handling partner bank volume alongside direct consumer transfers — deliver outsized strategic value. ML Engineers who build models for the Wise Platform API ecosystem enable B2B revenue growth.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Model Financial Impact**
> "My ML models will directly impact Wise's P&L — fraud detection preventing millions in losses, pricing optimization managing fee margins across billions in monthly volume. My compensation should reflect this direct financial impact, particularly the RSU component on LSE: WISE, which ties my equity to the model performance I deliver. Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating depends on the accuracy and fairness of these models."

**Lever 2 — Fraud Prevention Asymmetric Value**
> "Every false negative in my fraud model is a direct financial loss. Every false positive is a lost customer and a hit to Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating. The asymmetric value of fraud prevention at Wise's scale — protecting billions in monthly volume — should be reflected in my RSU grant on LSE: WISE."

**Lever 3 — AI Talent Retention Equity**
> "ML engineers with production fintech experience are among the most competitive talent pools globally. I'm evaluating opportunities at quant firms, Big Tech, and fintech competitors. I'd like an RSU grant that reflects retention priority — a meaningful 4-year grant on LSE: WISE that competitively positions Wise against these alternatives."

**Lever 4 — Wise Platform API ML Scope**
> "The Wise Platform API requires ML models that serve both B2C and B2B contexts at enterprise scale. This dual-context ML scope is significantly more complex than single-product ML work. I'd like my compensation to reflect the Wise Platform API's ML requirements, including pricing, fraud detection, and risk management for partner bank volume."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 75th percentile of the compensation band. For London, push for £108,000 base + £72,000 RSU (4yr) = £180,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: £85,000 base + £45,000 RSU = £130,000 total. For Tallinn, target €82,000 base + €52,000 RSU = €134,000 total. For Singapore, target S$140,000 base + S$85,000 RSU = S$225,000 total. ML/AI Engineers should negotiate aggressively on RSU grants — the direct P&L impact of ML models at Wise's scale justifies above-median equity. Push for sign-on RSU acceleration if transitioning from Big Tech or quant firms. Frame ML talent scarcity and the direct connection between your models and LSE: WISE share price.
