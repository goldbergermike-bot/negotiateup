#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £65,000 – £95,000 | £30,000 – £60,000 | £95,000 – £155,000 |
| Tallinn (EUR) | €50,000 – €72,000 | €22,000 – €45,000 | €72,000 – €117,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$85,000 – S$125,000 | S$38,000 – S$70,000 | S$123,000 – S$195,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Managers at Wise operate with unusual autonomy — Wise's flat structure means you own outcomes, not just outputs. Your product decisions determine whether Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating holds, whether the Wise Platform API gains new enterprise partners, and whether the mid-market infrastructure scales to new corridors and customer segments. RSU grants vest over 4 years on LSE: WISE, giving you liquid equity tied to the growth your product decisions drive. Frame your product intuition as a revenue-generating asset.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Wise Level | Revolut Equivalent | Monzo Equivalent | Airwallex Equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Product Manager (PM2) | Product Manager | Product Manager | Product Manager |
| Senior PM (PM3) | Senior Product Manager | Senior PM | Senior Product Manager |

Wise PM compensation is competitive with Monzo and slightly below Revolut at the senior level, but Wise's public RSU liquidity and mission-driven autonomy differentiate the offer. PMs at Wise have direct impact visibility that many competitor PMs lack due to more layered organizational structures.

#### 🏗️ Wise Mid-Market Infrastructure & Platform Integrity Lever

**LSE Public Status**: Wise's LSE listing (LSE: WISE) provides Product Managers with liquid equity that directly ties their wealth creation to the product decisions they make. When you launch a corridor, improve conversion, or onboard a Wise Platform API partner, the revenue impact flows through to LSE: WISE share price. This is a tangible link between your product work and your equity compensation.

**4.3 Trustpilot Rating**: As a Product Manager, you shape the customer experience that produces Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot score. Every onboarding flow, transfer experience, and pricing display decision you make either sustains or erodes this trust metric. Frame your product leadership as directly owning the customer trust that differentiates Wise in financial services.

**Platform Integrity Positioning**: PMs at Wise are Platform Integrity stewards. Your roadmap decisions determine which features ship, which corridors launch, and how transparency is communicated to customers. You define the product strategy that makes mid-market infrastructure trustworthy, intuitive, and scalable. Position your compensation expectations around this strategic ownership.

**Wise Platform API**: The Wise Platform API is a PM-driven B2B growth engine. Product Managers define API surface area, partner experience, pricing strategy, and go-to-market sequencing for enterprise partners. Every bank or business you help onboard onto Wise Platform is a new revenue channel. This B2B product ownership is a premium responsibility that should be reflected in your package.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Revenue-Driving Product Ownership**
> "My product decisions will directly impact Wise's revenue — new corridor launches, conversion optimization, and retention strategy across 16+ million customers. I'd like my compensation to reflect this direct revenue ownership, particularly the RSU component on LSE: WISE, which ties my equity to the growth I drive."

**Lever 2 — Platform Integrity Trust Stewardship**
> "Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating is the output of deliberate product decisions about transparency, pricing display, and customer experience. As a PM, I'll own the product strategy that sustains this trust moat. My compensation should reflect the strategic weight of owning the customer experience that produces an industry-leading trust score."

**Lever 3 — Wise Platform API B2B Product Scope**
> "The Wise Platform API is one of Wise's most strategic growth channels. I'll define the B2B product roadmap — API design, partner experience, enterprise pricing. This is dual-sided product responsibility (B2C + B2B) that commands a premium. I'd like a 5-10% scope adjustment on my base to reflect this expanded ownership."

**Lever 4 — Multi-Region Product Leadership**
> "I'm evaluating PM opportunities across London, Tallinn, and Singapore. Wise's mission and autonomy are compelling. I'd like a package that reflects the cost of living and talent market competitiveness of my specific location, with consistent RSU treatment on LSE: WISE equity across all regions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 70th percentile of the compensation band. For London, push for £85,000 base + £50,000 RSU (4yr) = £135,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: £70,000 base + £35,000 RSU = £105,000 total. For Tallinn, target €65,000 base + €38,000 RSU = €103,000 total. For Singapore, target S$110,000 base + S$60,000 RSU = S$170,000 total. PMs should negotiate for Wise Platform API team assignment as a lever — B2B product scope justifies higher compensation. Push for RSU grants that reflect the revenue attribution of your product decisions.
