### Software Engineer — Wise Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Wise's Mid-Market Infrastructure strategy, translating the LSE public status (LSE: WISE) and industry-leading 4.3 Trustpilot rating into a software engineering compensation framework spanning London, Tallinn, and Singapore markets. As a Software Engineer at Wise, you are a foundational builder of the Platform Integrity layer that powers billions in cross-border transactions and the Wise Platform API used by banks and enterprises worldwide.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £55,000 – £75,000 | £20,000 – £40,000 | £75,000 – £115,000 |
| Tallinn (EUR) | €42,000 – €60,000 | €15,000 – €30,000 | €57,000 – €90,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$72,000 – S$100,000 | S$25,000 – S$50,000 | S$97,000 – S$150,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Wise's RSU grants vest over 4 years and are tied to LSE: WISE equity — a publicly traded, liquid asset. Unlike pre-IPO startups where equity is speculative, your RSUs carry real, mark-to-market value. The 4.3 Trustpilot rating reflects a customer trust moat that directly depends on the Platform Integrity you build. Use this public-company stability and transparent pricing mission as leverage: your code powers the mid-market infrastructure that 16+ million customers and hundreds of enterprise partners rely on.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Wise Level | Revolut Equivalent | Monzo Equivalent | Airwallex Equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Software Engineer (IC2) | Software Engineer | Software Engineer | Software Engineer |
| Software Engineer (IC2+) | Mid Software Engineer | Mid Engineer | Engineer II |

Wise tends to pay competitively against Monzo and slightly below Revolut at the IC2 level, but Wise's RSU program (publicly traded on LSE) and transparent culture offer a distinct advantage over competitors with illiquid private equity. Airwallex in Singapore is a relevant benchmark for APAC positioning.

#### 🏗️ Wise Mid-Market Infrastructure & Platform Integrity Lever

**LSE Public Status**: Wise trades on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: WISE), giving employees access to liquid, publicly valued equity. This is a significant differentiator against fintech competitors still private (Revolut, Monzo). Your RSU grants are real-time valued — use this when comparing against competitors offering options or phantom equity.

**4.3 Trustpilot Rating**: Wise maintains a 4.3 Trustpilot score — exceptional in financial services where incumbents often sit at 1.5-2.5. This trust score is a competitive moat built directly on the reliability and integrity of the platform you engineer. Frame your work as trust-critical: every deployment, every API response, every uptime metric feeds into the customer confidence that sustains Wise's growth flywheel.

**Platform Integrity Positioning**: Wise's brand is built on transparency — showing the real exchange rate, revealing fees upfront, and delivering money at the mid-market rate. As a Software Engineer, your code is the Platform Integrity layer. Position yourself as a guardian of this transparency promise: you don't just ship features, you ship trust.

**Wise Platform API**: The Wise Platform API enables banks (like Monzo, N26, Stanford FCU) and businesses to embed Wise's cross-border rails directly into their products. This B2B platform business is a high-growth revenue driver. As a Software Engineer, you may contribute to API reliability, partner integrations, or infrastructure that scales the Wise Platform to new enterprise clients. This is your growth narrative — you're building infrastructure that scales revenue beyond consumer.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — LSE Liquidity Premium**
> "I want to acknowledge the value of Wise's public equity. RSUs on LSE: WISE are liquid and transparent — unlike private fintech equity, I can value them precisely. Given this, I'd like to ensure my total compensation reflects the market rate for a Software Engineer contributing to a publicly traded fintech infrastructure platform."

**Lever 2 — Platform Integrity Impact**
> "Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating is an industry outlier — most financial services companies sit well below 3.0. That rating is sustained by Platform Integrity: the code quality, uptime, and reliability that engineers like me deliver. I'd like my compensation to reflect the direct connection between engineering excellence and Wise's competitive trust moat."

**Lever 3 — Wise Platform API Growth**
> "The Wise Platform API is enabling banks and businesses globally to embed Wise's rails. This B2B channel is a significant revenue growth driver, and the engineering work powering it — API reliability, scalability, partner onboarding — is directly tied to revenue expansion. I'd like to discuss how my role in this growth is reflected in my package."

**Lever 4 — Multi-Region Cost-of-Living Arbitrage**
> "I understand Wise benchmarks compensation regionally across London, Tallinn, and Singapore. I'd like to discuss how my specific location's cost of living and talent market competitiveness factor into my offer, particularly given that Wise competes for talent against both traditional banks and well-funded fintechs in each market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 65th percentile of the compensation band. For London, push for £68,000 base + £35,000 RSU (4yr) = £103,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: £60,000 base + £25,000 RSU = £85,000 total. For Tallinn, target €55,000 base + €25,000 RSU = €80,000 total. For Singapore, target S$90,000 base + S$40,000 RSU = S$130,000 total. Always negotiate RSU grants as a separate lever from base — Wise's public equity is liquid and should be valued at current market price, not discounted. If the initial offer is at the 50th percentile, use the Platform Integrity and Wise Platform API growth levers to justify a 10-15% uplift.
