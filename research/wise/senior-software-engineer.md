### Senior Software Engineer — Wise Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Wise's Mid-Market Infrastructure strategy, translating the LSE public status (LSE: WISE) and industry-leading 4.3 Trustpilot rating into a senior software engineering compensation framework spanning London, Tallinn, and Singapore markets. As a Senior Software Engineer at Wise, you are a technical leader shaping the Platform Integrity architecture that underpins billions in transparent cross-border transactions and the Wise Platform API's enterprise-grade reliability.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £75,000 – £105,000 | £40,000 – £80,000 | £115,000 – £185,000 |
| Tallinn (EUR) | €58,000 – €82,000 | €30,000 – €60,000 | €88,000 – €142,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$100,000 – S$140,000 | S$50,000 – S$90,000 | S$150,000 – S$230,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: At the senior level, Wise's RSU grants become a substantial portion of total compensation. These vest over 4 years on LSE: WISE — publicly traded, liquid equity you can value in real time. The 4.3 Trustpilot rating is not a vanity metric; it is a revenue driver sustained by the Platform Integrity you architect. Senior Engineers at Wise own system design decisions that directly impact availability, latency, and the trust millions of customers place in the platform. Your leverage is clear: you are a steward of mid-market infrastructure integrity.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Wise Level | Revolut Equivalent | Monzo Equivalent | Airwallex Equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Senior Software Engineer (IC3) | Senior Software Engineer | Senior Engineer | Senior Engineer |
| Senior Software Engineer (IC3+) | Senior+ / Staff pathway | Senior+ Engineer | Staff pathway |

At the senior level, Wise is competitive with Monzo and narrowing the gap with Revolut, particularly when RSU liquidity is properly valued. Revolut offers higher base in some cases but with illiquid private equity. Wise's transparent compensation philosophy and LSE-listed RSUs close this gap significantly on a risk-adjusted basis. Airwallex Singapore benchmarks are relevant for APAC offers.

#### 🏗️ Wise Mid-Market Infrastructure & Platform Integrity Lever

**LSE Public Status**: Wise's listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: WISE) means your RSU grants are backed by publicly traded, liquid equity. At the senior level, RSU grants of £40,000-£80,000 over 4 years represent meaningful wealth accumulation with none of the liquidity risk of pre-IPO competitors. Use this as a direct comparison: £60,000 in Wise RSUs is worth £60,000 today; £60,000 in Revolut options is worth an uncertain future amount.

**4.3 Trustpilot Rating**: Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot score across hundreds of thousands of reviews is an extraordinary achievement in financial services. This score is the quantified output of Platform Integrity — the system reliability, transparent pricing, and consistent delivery that Senior Engineers own. Position yourself as a custodian of this trust metric: your architectural decisions directly correlate with customer satisfaction and retention.

**Platform Integrity Positioning**: As a Senior Software Engineer, you own the technical decisions that define Platform Integrity. This means system design for fault tolerance, API contract stability, data consistency across multi-currency operations, and the reliability guarantees that let Wise promise transparent, fast, and cheap transfers. You are not just writing code — you are architecting trust at scale.

**Wise Platform API**: The Wise Platform API is Wise's B2B growth engine, enabling banks, neobanks, and enterprises to embed Wise's mid-market rate rails. Senior Engineers shape API design, versioning strategy, SLA guarantees, and partner integration patterns. This work directly drives Wise's enterprise revenue diversification — a key growth narrative for LSE investors. Frame your contributions as directly connected to revenue expansion and shareholder value.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — LSE Liquidity Premium**
> "My total compensation should reflect the real, liquid value of Wise RSUs. On LSE: WISE, my equity grants are publicly priced and tradable — there is no liquidity discount. I'd like to discuss an RSU package that reflects the 65th-75th percentile for a Senior Engineer at a public fintech platform, not the discounted rates appropriate for private company stock."

**Lever 2 — Platform Integrity Ownership**
> "As a Senior Engineer, I'll own architectural decisions that directly sustain Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating — an industry-leading trust score. Platform Integrity at this level means system design, fault tolerance, and API reliability that millions of customers and enterprise partners depend on. My compensation should reflect this ownership scope and its direct impact on customer retention and revenue."

**Lever 3 — Wise Platform API Revenue Impact**
> "The Wise Platform API is a strategic growth channel — enabling banks and businesses to embed Wise's rails. At the senior level, I'll shape API architecture, SLA guarantees, and partner integration patterns that directly drive enterprise revenue. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect the revenue impact of this B2B platform work, which is a key growth story for LSE: WISE investors."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Market Talent Scarcity**
> "Senior fintech engineers with experience in payment infrastructure, multi-currency systems, and regulatory compliance are scarce across London, Tallinn, and Singapore. I'm evaluating opportunities at both traditional banks (with higher base) and growth fintechs (with higher equity upside). I'd like a package that positions Wise competitively across both dimensions — stable base with meaningful liquid equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 70th percentile of the compensation band. For London, push for £95,000 base + £70,000 RSU (4yr) = £165,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: £80,000 base + £45,000 RSU = £125,000 total. For Tallinn, target €75,000 base + €50,000 RSU = €125,000 total. For Singapore, target S$125,000 base + S$80,000 RSU = S$205,000 total. At the senior level, RSU negotiation is where the real leverage sits — push for a larger initial grant and discuss refresh grants tied to performance. Wise's public equity makes refresh grants particularly valuable; negotiate for annual refresh commitments in writing.
