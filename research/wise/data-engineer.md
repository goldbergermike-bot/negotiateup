### Data Engineer — Wise Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Wise's Mid-Market Infrastructure strategy, translating the LSE public status (LSE: WISE) and industry-leading 4.3 Trustpilot rating into a data engineering compensation framework spanning London, Tallinn, and Singapore markets. As a Data Engineer at Wise, you build and maintain the data infrastructure layer of Platform Integrity — the pipelines, processing systems, and data platforms that power real-time pricing, fraud detection, regulatory reporting, and the Wise Platform API's analytics across 80+ countries and 50+ currencies.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £60,000 – £90,000 | £25,000 – £50,000 | £85,000 – £140,000 |
| Tallinn (EUR) | €46,000 – €68,000 | €18,000 – €38,000 | €64,000 – €106,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$78,000 – S$118,000 | S$32,000 – S$60,000 | S$110,000 – S$178,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Engineers at Wise build the foundational data infrastructure that every analytical function depends on — pricing models, fraud detection, compliance reporting, business intelligence, and ML pipelines. Without reliable, real-time data pipelines, Wise cannot price transfers accurately, detect fraud in milliseconds, report to regulators on time, or make data-driven product decisions. RSU grants vest over 4 years on LSE: WISE, and your data infrastructure directly sustains the Platform Integrity and 4.3 Trustpilot rating that drive Wise's public market valuation.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Wise Level | Revolut Equivalent | Monzo Equivalent | Airwallex Equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Data Engineer (IC2) | Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data Engineer |
| Senior Data Engineer (IC3) | Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer |

Wise DE compensation is competitive with fintech peers when RSU liquidity on LSE is factored in. The regulatory complexity of financial data pipelines (multi-jurisdictional compliance, AML reporting, real-time transaction processing) elevates the scope beyond typical SaaS data engineering roles.

#### 🏗️ Wise Mid-Market Infrastructure & Platform Integrity Lever

**LSE Public Status**: Wise's LSE listing (LSE: WISE) means your data infrastructure powers publicly reported financial metrics. Transaction volumes, revenue, and operational KPIs that flow through your pipelines are investor-visible. Your RSU grants are liquid equity tied to the data reliability you deliver — accurate, timely data is a prerequisite for investor trust.

**4.3 Trustpilot Rating**: Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot score depends on accurate pricing, fast transactions, and reliable service — all outcomes enabled by the data infrastructure you build. Pricing models need real-time FX data, fraud detection needs streaming transaction data, and customer support needs operational data. Your pipelines are the invisible foundation of the trust that produces this rating.

**Platform Integrity Positioning**: Data Engineers at Wise are the information backbone of Platform Integrity. You ensure that data flows accurately, reliably, and in real time across the entire platform — from transaction processing to regulatory reporting to ML model training. Without your data infrastructure, Platform Integrity cannot be measured, monitored, or maintained.

**Wise Platform API**: The Wise Platform API generates enterprise-scale data volumes from partner integrations. Data Engineers who build pipelines that handle both B2C and B2B data at scale — including partner analytics, reconciliation, and reporting — deliver strategic value to Wise's enterprise growth.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Real-Time Pipeline Financial Impact**
> "I'll own data pipelines processing millions of financial events daily across 80+ countries and 50+ currencies. Data accuracy failures have direct financial and regulatory consequences. My compensation should reflect the financial criticality of the data layer I build, plus the Platform Integrity responsibility of powering pricing, fraud detection, and compliance for a publicly traded company on LSE: WISE."

**Lever 2 — Regulatory Data Compliance**
> "My data pipelines power regulatory reporting for FCA, MAS, and AML compliance across multiple jurisdictions. Data accuracy failures have legal and financial consequences. I'd like my compensation to include a regulatory complexity adjustment reflecting the compliance accountability inherent in building financial data infrastructure. Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating depends on the reliability of this data."

**Lever 3 — Wise Platform API Data Infrastructure**
> "The Wise Platform API generates enterprise-scale data from partner integrations. Building data pipelines that handle both B2C and B2B data at scale — including partner analytics, reconciliation, and reporting — is premium data engineering scope. My RSU grant on LSE: WISE should reflect this Wise Platform API data infrastructure ownership."

**Lever 4 — Multi-Region Data Engineering Talent**
> "Data engineers with experience in real-time financial data processing, multi-currency pipelines, and regulatory reporting are scarce across London, Tallinn, and Singapore. I'd like a package that reflects this talent scarcity, with consistent RSU treatment on LSE: WISE across all regions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 65th percentile of the compensation band. For London, push for £80,000 base + £42,000 RSU (4yr) = £122,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: £65,000 base + £28,000 RSU = £93,000 total. For Tallinn, target €60,000 base + €30,000 RSU = €90,000 total. For Singapore, target S$102,000 base + S$50,000 RSU = S$152,000 total. Data Engineers should quantify pipeline financial impact — every data accuracy improvement compounds across billions in monthly volume. Push for RSU grants reflecting the foundational role your data infrastructure plays in sustaining Platform Integrity and the 4.3 Trustpilot rating.
