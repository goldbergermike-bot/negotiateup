### DevOps Engineer — Wise Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Wise's Mid-Market Infrastructure strategy, translating the LSE public status (LSE: WISE) and industry-leading 4.3 Trustpilot rating into a DevOps engineering compensation framework spanning London, Tallinn, and Singapore markets. As a DevOps Engineer at Wise, you own the infrastructure layer of Platform Integrity — the cloud architecture, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and site reliability that ensure Wise's mid-market rate infrastructure runs at scale for the consumer product and the Wise Platform API.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £60,000 – £90,000 | £25,000 – £50,000 | £85,000 – £140,000 |
| Tallinn (EUR) | €46,000 – €68,000 | €18,000 – €38,000 | €64,000 – €106,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$78,000 – S$118,000 | S$32,000 – S$60,000 | S$110,000 – S$178,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: DevOps Engineers at Wise own the infrastructure that sits between code and customers. When a customer in Tokyo sends money to Berlin, your infrastructure ensures it arrives in seconds. You manage cloud costs that directly impact Wise's ability to maintain transparent pricing. You build CI/CD pipelines enabling hundreds of engineers to deploy safely. At a public company listed on LSE: WISE with a 4.3 Trustpilot rating, uptime is not optional — it is a regulatory and financial requirement. RSU grants vest over 4 years on liquid, publicly traded equity, and your infrastructure work directly sustains the Platform Integrity that drives Wise's valuation.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Wise Level | Revolut Equivalent | Monzo Equivalent | Airwallex Equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| DevOps Engineer (IC2) | DevOps / SRE | Platform Engineer | DevOps Engineer |
| Senior DevOps (IC3) | Senior SRE | Senior Platform Engineer | Senior DevOps |

Wise DevOps compensation is competitive with Monzo and comparable to Revolut when RSU liquidity on LSE is factored in. The regulatory stakes of financial infrastructure (FCA, MAS compliance) elevate the scope and accountability of DevOps at Wise beyond typical SaaS infrastructure roles.

#### 🏗️ Wise Mid-Market Infrastructure & Platform Integrity Lever

**LSE Public Status**: Wise's LSE listing (LSE: WISE) means your infrastructure reliability directly impacts a publicly traded company's operational metrics. Cloud cost optimization, uptime, and deployment velocity are investor-visible KPIs. Your RSU grants are liquid equity tied to the infrastructure stability you deliver.

**4.3 Trustpilot Rating**: Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot score depends on system availability, transaction speed, and consistent delivery — all infrastructure outcomes. Every outage avoided, every latency reduction, every successful deployment sustains the customer trust that produces this industry-leading rating. Frame your DevOps work as directly producing the reliability behind the trust score.

**Platform Integrity Positioning**: DevOps Engineers at Wise are the infrastructure backbone of Platform Integrity. You design auto-scaling policies, monitoring systems, disaster recovery plans, and deployment pipelines that ensure money moves correctly at the mid-market rate, 24/7, across 80+ countries. Your infrastructure decisions determine whether Platform Integrity is a promise or a reality.

**Wise Platform API**: The Wise Platform API requires enterprise-grade infrastructure SLAs. Partner banks and businesses embedding Wise's rails demand 99.99%+ uptime, low latency, and security compliance. DevOps Engineers who build and maintain Wise Platform API infrastructure own B2B reliability — a direct revenue driver.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Cloud Cost Optimization Impact**
> "I'll own cloud infrastructure optimization for systems processing billions in monthly volume. A 10% reduction in cloud costs at Wise's scale saves millions annually and directly sustains the transparent pricing that produces your 4.3 Trustpilot rating. My compensation should reflect this cost impact, plus the Platform Integrity responsibility of maintaining infrastructure for a publicly traded financial platform on LSE: WISE."

**Lever 2 — Uptime & Regulatory SLA Ownership**
> "I'm accountable for 99.99%+ uptime on FCA-regulated financial infrastructure. This is a higher-stakes reliability mandate than most DevOps roles. Every minute of downtime is both a customer trust event and a regulatory concern. I'd like my RSU grant on LSE: WISE to reflect the regulatory weight of this Platform Integrity responsibility."

**Lever 3 — Wise Platform API Infrastructure**
> "The Wise Platform API demands enterprise-grade infrastructure SLAs for partner banks and businesses. Building and maintaining this B2B infrastructure layer is premium DevOps scope with direct revenue attribution. I'd like my compensation to reflect this Wise Platform API infrastructure ownership."

**Lever 4 — Multi-Region Infrastructure Talent**
> "DevOps engineers with experience in regulated financial infrastructure, multi-region cloud architecture, and payment system reliability are scarce across London, Tallinn, and Singapore. I'd like a package that reflects this scarcity, with consistent RSU treatment on LSE: WISE across all regions."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 65th percentile of the compensation band. For London, push for £80,000 base + £42,000 RSU (4yr) = £122,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: £65,000 base + £28,000 RSU = £93,000 total. For Tallinn, target €60,000 base + €30,000 RSU = €90,000 total. For Singapore, target S$102,000 base + S$50,000 RSU = S$152,000 total. DevOps engineers should negotiate cloud cost savings as quantifiable impact — every dollar saved in infrastructure costs sustains Wise's transparent pricing. Push for RSU grants reflecting the Platform Integrity uptime responsibility for a regulated, LSE-listed financial platform.
