**Negotiation DNA**: Solutions Architects at Wise are the technical face of the Wise Platform API.

#### 🏗️ Wise Mid-Market Infrastructure & Platform Integrity Lever

**LSE Public Status**: Wise's LSE listing (LSE: WISE) makes every partner integration a publicly visible growth metric. When you onboard a new bank onto the Wise Platform API, the volume and revenue impact flows through to LSE: WISE quarterly earnings. Your RSU grants are liquid equity directly tied to the enterprise growth your integration architecture enables.

**4.3 Trustpilot Rating**: Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot score extends beyond direct customers to partner-embedded experiences. When a Monzo customer sends an international transfer powered by Wise's rails, the trust experience must meet Wise's standards within the partner context. Solutions Architects who design integrations that maintain Platform Integrity across partner experiences sustain this trust metric at enterprise scale.

**Platform Integrity Positioning**: Solutions Architects are the enterprise ambassadors of Platform Integrity. You design integration architectures that ensure Wise's transparency, reliability, and mid-market rate promise extend seamlessly into partner products. Your architecture decisions determine whether enterprise partners experience the same Platform Integrity that direct customers do — consistency across contexts is the hallmark of a well-architected platform.

**Wise Platform API**: This role is centered on the Wise Platform API. You define integration patterns, design partner onboarding architectures, specify API contracts, and ensure reliability guarantees for enterprise clients. Every bank, neobank, or business you help integrate is a multiplier on Wise's transaction volume. Frame your role as directly enabling the Wise Platform API's B2B revenue growth — one of Wise's most strategic priorities.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Partner Revenue Enablement**
> "Each partner integration I architect generates recurring B2B revenue through the Wise Platform API. A single major bank integration can generate millions in annual recurring revenue. My compensation should reflect this direct revenue enablement scope, particularly the RSU component on LSE: WISE, which ties my equity to the enterprise growth I drive."

**Lever 2 — Technical Pre-Sales Impact**
> "I serve as the technical authority in partner sales conversations for the Wise Platform API. My architecture proposals directly influence whether partners sign with Wise. I'd like my compensation to include a scope adjustment reflecting this pre-sales technical leadership that directly impacts Wise's B2B pipeline conversion."

**Lever 3 — Platform Integrity at Enterprise Scale**
> "Maintaining Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating and Platform Integrity standards across partner-embedded experiences requires architecture that is both robust and flexible. I'll design integration patterns that ensure enterprise partners deliver the same trust experience Wise's direct customers expect. My RSU grant on LSE: WISE should reflect this enterprise-scale Platform Integrity responsibility."

**Lever 4 — Multi-Region Partner Coverage**
> "I'm evaluating opportunities across London, Tallinn, and Singapore. Each region offers proximity to different partner ecosystems — London for European banks, Singapore for APAC financial institutions. I'd like a package that reflects the strategic value of my location for partner coverage, with consistent RSU treatment on LSE: WISE."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 70th percentile of the compensation band. For London, push for £98,000 base + £60,000 RSU (4yr) = £158,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: £80,000 base + £40,000 RSU = £120,000 total. For Tallinn, target €75,000 base + €42,000 RSU = €117,000 total. For Singapore, target S$128,000 base + S$72,000 RSU = S$200,000 total. Solutions Architects should quantify partner revenue enablement — each integration has measurable revenue attribution. Negotiate RSU grants that reflect the B2B revenue your Wise Platform API integrations generate for LSE: WISE investors.
