#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £65,000 – £95,000 | £28,000 – £55,000 | £93,000 – £150,000 |
| Tallinn (EUR) | €50,000 – €72,000 | €20,000 – €42,000 | €70,000 – €114,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Technical Program Managers at Wise coordinate initiatives that span multiple squads, time zones, and regulatory jurisdictions. When Wise launches a new payment corridor, onboards a major Wise Platform API partner, or executes a regulatory compliance program, a TPM drives the cross-functional execution. At a public company listed on LSE: WISE with a 4.3 Trustpilot rating, program execution is board-level visible — missed deadlines on compliance or partner launches have material financial and reputational consequences. RSU grants vest over 4 years on liquid, publicly traded equity.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Wise Level | Revolut Equivalent | Monzo Equivalent | Airwallex Equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| TPM (TPM2) | Technical Program Manager | Delivery Manager | Technical Program Manager |
| Senior TPM (TPM3) | Senior TPM | Senior Delivery Manager | Senior TPM |

Wise TPM compensation is competitive with fintech peers and the regulatory complexity of cross-border payments elevates the scope beyond typical SaaS TPM roles. The combination of multi-jurisdictional compliance, Wise Platform API partner coordination, and cross-timezone delivery justifies premium compensation.

#### 🏗️ Wise Mid-Market Infrastructure & Platform Integrity Lever

**LSE Public Status**: Wise's LSE listing (LSE: WISE) means your program delivery has direct investor visibility. Major corridor launches, Wise Platform API partner integrations, and compliance programs are publicly reported milestones. Your RSU grants are liquid equity tied to the execution velocity you deliver — every program shipped on time is a growth signal for LSE investors.

**4.3 Trustpilot Rating**: Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot score depends on consistent, high-quality delivery across all customer-facing systems. TPMs ensure that Platform Integrity is maintained during launches, migrations, and integrations — the moments of highest risk to customer trust. Position yourself as the execution leader who protects the trust metric during complex, multi-workstream programs.

**Platform Integrity Positioning**: TPMs at Wise are the coordination layer of Platform Integrity. You ensure that engineering, product, compliance, and operations are aligned on delivery timelines, quality standards, and risk management. Your program management determines whether Platform Integrity is maintained during the most complex, highest-risk initiatives.

**Wise Platform API**: TPMs coordinate Wise Platform API partner integrations — some of the highest-impact, most cross-functional programs in the company. Partner onboarding requires engineering, legal, compliance, product, and operations alignment. TPMs who drive these integrations efficiently are directly enabling B2B revenue growth.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Cross-Functional Execution Scope**
> "I'll coordinate programs spanning engineering, product, compliance, and operations across London, Tallinn, and Singapore. This cross-functional, multi-timezone scope is significantly more complex than single-team program management. My compensation should reflect this execution complexity and the Platform Integrity responsibility of delivering on time for a publicly traded company on LSE: WISE."

**Lever 2 — Regulatory Program Ownership**
> "Financial services program management carries regulatory weight — FCA, MAS, and multi-jurisdictional compliance across 80+ countries. Program failures have legal and financial consequences. I'd like my compensation to include a regulatory complexity adjustment reflecting the compliance accountability inherent in cross-border payment TPM work. Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating depends on the reliability of regulatory compliance execution."

**Lever 3 — Wise Platform API Partner Coordination**
> "Wise Platform API partner integrations are among the most complex programs at Wise — requiring engineering, legal, compliance, product, and operations alignment. Each successful integration drives measurable B2B revenue. I'd like my RSU grant on LSE: WISE to reflect the revenue impact of Wise Platform API program delivery."

**Lever 4 — Multi-Region Execution Leadership**
> "I'm evaluating TPM opportunities across London, Tallinn, and Singapore. The cross-timezone coordination inherent in a non-London TPM placement is itself a differentiator. I'd like a package with consistent RSU treatment on LSE: WISE across all regions, with base adjusted for local market competitiveness."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 65th percentile of the compensation band. For London, push for £85,000 base + £45,000 RSU (4yr) = £130,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: £70,000 base + £32,000 RSU = £102,000 total. For Tallinn, target €65,000 base + €35,000 RSU = €100,000 total. For Singapore, target S$110,000 base + S$55,000 RSU = S$165,000 total. TPMs should negotiate program scope as a lever — Wise Platform API partner integration programs or multi-jurisdictional compliance programs justify higher compensation. Push for RSU grants reflecting the execution velocity and Platform Integrity responsibility your programs deliver.
