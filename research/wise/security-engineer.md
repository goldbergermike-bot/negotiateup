**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers at Wise protect the Platform Integrity that sustains Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating, regulatory compliance across 80+ countries, and the trust of enterprise partners on the Wise Platform API. In financial services, security is existential — a single significant breach could cost hundreds of millions in regulatory fines, customer restitution, and reputational damage. RSU grants vest over 4 years on LSE: WISE, and your security work directly protects the equity value by preventing catastrophic loss events. Frame security not as a cost center, but as the trust infrastructure that enables Wise's mid-market rate platform to attract billions in monthly volume.

#### 🏗️ Wise Mid-Market Infrastructure & Platform Integrity Lever

**LSE Public Status**: Wise's LSE listing (LSE: WISE) means a security incident is a material event with share price and regulatory implications. Your security work directly protects the equity value of your RSU grants and every other employee's equity. This is asymmetric value creation — the downside you prevent is orders of magnitude larger than your compensation. Negotiate your RSU grants accordingly.

**4.3 Trustpilot Rating**: Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot score depends on customers trusting the platform with their money. A single significant security incident could destroy this trust overnight. Security Engineers are the last line of defense for the trust metric that defines Wise's competitive moat. Frame your work as directly sustaining the customer confidence that produces this industry-leading rating.

**Platform Integrity Positioning**: Security Engineers at Wise are Platform Integrity protectors. You design security architectures for payment systems, conduct penetration testing on infrastructure handling billions, implement encryption and access control for multi-currency financial data, and ensure compliance with PCI-DSS, SOC 2, FCA regulations, and GDPR. Your work is the defensive perimeter of Platform Integrity — without it, the entire trust promise collapses.

**Wise Platform API**: The Wise Platform API extends Wise's security perimeter to enterprise partners. Banks and businesses embedding Wise's rails expect enterprise-grade security guarantees. Security Engineers who architect the API security layer — authentication, authorization, rate limiting, data protection — enable B2B revenue growth by meeting the security standards enterprise partners demand.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Regulatory Compliance Premium**
> "I'll own security compliance for a London Stock Exchange-listed, FCA-regulated financial services company processing billions monthly. My work directly protects Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating and Platform Integrity from threat actors and compliance violations. My compensation should reflect the regulatory stakes of this responsibility — specifically, RSU grants on LSE: WISE that acknowledge the equity value I protect."

**Lever 2 — Threat Prevention ROI**
> "Every security incident I prevent saves Wise millions in potential losses. A significant breach at Wise's scale could cost hundreds of millions in regulatory fines and customer restitution. The asymmetric value of security prevention should be reflected in my compensation — I am protecting the entire Platform Integrity moat."

**Lever 3 — Wise Platform API Security Architecture**
> "The Wise Platform API requires enterprise-grade security guarantees for partner banks and businesses. I'll architect the API security layer — authentication, authorization, data protection — that enables B2B revenue growth. My RSU grant on LSE: WISE should reflect this revenue-enabling security work."

**Lever 4 — Fintech Security Talent Scarcity**
> "Security engineers with financial regulatory experience (PCI-DSS, SOC 2, FCA, GDPR) across multiple jurisdictions are among the scarcest talent pools globally. I'm evaluating opportunities at banks, Big Tech, and fintech competitors across London, Tallinn, and Singapore. I'd like a retention-focused package with meaningful RSU grants on LSE: WISE."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 70th percentile of the compensation band. For London, push for £92,000 base + £55,000 RSU (4yr) = £147,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: £75,000 base + £35,000 RSU = £110,000 total. For Tallinn, target €72,000 base + €40,000 RSU = €112,000 total. For Singapore, target S$120,000 base + S$65,000 RSU = S$185,000 total. Security engineers should frame their work as asymmetric value creation — the downside they prevent is orders of magnitude larger than their compensation. Push for RSU grants reflecting the Platform Integrity protection you provide to LSE: WISE equity value.
