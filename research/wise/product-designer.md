#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £55,000 – £80,000 | £20,000 – £40,000 | £75,000 – £120,000 |
| Tallinn (EUR) | €42,000 – €62,000 | €15,000 – €30,000 | €57,000 – €92,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$72,000 – S$105,000 | S$25,000 – S$48,000 | S$97,000 – S$153,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Designers at Wise design the most trust-critical interfaces in fintech. When a customer sees the mid-market exchange rate, transparent fee breakdown, and delivery estimate — that is your design decision converting transparency into trust. Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating is, in significant part, a design achievement. RSU grants vest over 4 years on LSE: WISE, giving you liquid equity directly tied to the customer experience you shape. Design at Wise is not decoration — it is the primary trust mechanism for a product where millions of customers hand over their money.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Wise Level | Revolut Equivalent | Monzo Equivalent | Airwallex Equivalent |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Product Designer (D2) | Product Designer | Product Designer | Product Designer |
| Senior Designer (D3) | Senior Product Designer | Senior Designer | Senior Product Designer |

Wise design compensation is competitive with Monzo and slightly below Revolut, but the mission-driven design culture and direct impact on a transparency-first product offer unique value. Wise designers have unusually high autonomy and direct customer impact compared to more feature-factory environments at larger fintechs.

#### 🏗️ Wise Mid-Market Infrastructure & Platform Integrity Lever

**LSE Public Status**: Wise's listing on LSE: WISE provides designers with publicly valued, liquid equity. Your RSU grants vest over 4 years and can be precisely compared against competing offers. Use this liquidity advantage in negotiations: Wise RSUs are worth face value today, unlike private company equity that carries discount risk.

**4.3 Trustpilot Rating**: Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot score is heavily influenced by product design decisions. The transparency UX — showing the real exchange rate, breaking down fees, and providing delivery estimates — is what converts first-time users into repeat customers. Position yourself as the designer who produces the trust that sustains this industry-leading score.

**Platform Integrity Positioning**: As a Product Designer, you own the visual and interaction layer of Platform Integrity. This means designing interfaces that make transparency tangible — converting abstract financial concepts into clear, trustworthy experiences. Your design systems and interaction patterns define what "transparent financial services" looks and feels like to millions of users.

**Wise Platform API**: The Wise Platform API requires design thinking that extends beyond Wise's own product. Partner banks and businesses embed Wise's rails, and the embedded experience design must maintain Platform Integrity standards within third-party contexts. Designers who create scalable design systems for both B2C and B2B contexts deliver exceptional strategic value.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Conversion Impact Premium**
> "Design-driven conversion improvements at Wise's scale directly impact revenue. A 5% improvement in transfer completion rate across 16+ million customers translates to millions in additional volume. My compensation should reflect the revenue impact of design at this scale, particularly the RSU component on LSE: WISE, which ties my equity to the conversion outcomes I drive."

**Lever 2 — Trust Experience Ownership**
> "Wise's 4.3 Trustpilot rating is substantially a design outcome — the transparency UX, fee clarity, and onboarding flow I'll design directly produce the customer trust that differentiates Wise. My compensation should reflect this direct connection between my design work and Wise's most important competitive metric."

**Lever 3 — Design Systems for Wise Platform API**
> "The Wise Platform API requires a design system that works across Wise's own product and embedded partner experiences. This is B2C + B2B design scope — significantly more complex than single-product design. I'd like a scope adjustment on my base to reflect the scalability requirement of designing for multiple audiences and contexts."

**Lever 4 — Multi-Region Design Leadership**
> "I'm evaluating design roles across London, Tallinn, and Singapore. Wise's transparency-first design culture and mission are compelling. I'd like a package with consistent RSU treatment on LSE: WISE equity across all regions, with base adjusted for local market competitiveness."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the 65th percentile of the compensation band. For London, push for £72,000 base + £35,000 RSU (4yr) = £107,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: £60,000 base + £22,000 RSU = £82,000 total. For Tallinn, target €55,000 base + €25,000 RSU = €80,000 total. For Singapore, target S$92,000 base + S$40,000 RSU = S$132,000 total. Designers should negotiate for Wise Platform design system scope as a premium — multi-context design responsibility justifies higher compensation. Push for RSU grants that reflect the conversion and retention impact of your design work.
