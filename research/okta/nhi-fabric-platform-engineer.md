NHI Fabric Platform Engineer RSU grants at Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) typically range from $120K-$500K+ over 4 years depending on level. This role carries a 15-20% premium over equivalent SWE levels due to the extreme scarcity of NHI Fabric expertise and the compliance-critical nature of the work under STIG 1.1.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Okta

The NHI Fabric Platform Engineer role exists because of a fundamental shift in enterprise identity: Non-Human Identities now outnumber human identities 50:1 across enterprise environments, and the February 3 STIG 1.1 update made governance of these machine identities a compliance mandate. This role is the tip of the spear — you build the platform that Okta's enterprise customers use to discover every service account, API key, AI agent credential, OAuth token, and machine certificate in their environment, then classify, govern, and secure them through automated Identity Governance workflows.

Before the Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update, NHI governance was a "nice-to-have" feature on enterprise roadmaps. After February 3, it became a compliance requirement. Enterprises discovered they had thousands of unmanaged service accounts, hundreds of shared API keys with no rotation policy, and a rapidly growing fleet of AI agent credentials with no governance framework. The 50:1 NHI-to-human ratio means the ungoverned attack surface dwarfed their existing identity management scope. Okta's NHI Fabric Platform is the answer — and you are the engineer who builds it.

This role commands the highest compensation premium of any engineering position at Okta because it sits at the exact intersection of the three most powerful market forces in identity security: (1) the STIG 1.1 compliance mandate, (2) the 50:1 NHI explosion, and (3) the AI agent governance imperative. Fewer than 200 engineers globally have the combination of identity protocol expertise, distributed systems architecture skill, and NHI domain knowledge required for this role. Okta competes for this talent against CyberArk, Astrix Security, Oasis Security, Silverfort, and the Non-Human Identity startups that raised $400M+ in 2025 — all offering equity packages designed to attract the scarce engineers who understand NHI governance at platform scale.

#### The NHI Fabric Platform — What You Build

The NHI Fabric Platform is the comprehensive system that manages every Non-Human Identity across the enterprise. As an NHI Fabric Platform Engineer, you build:

**NHI Discovery Engine**: Automated scanning and discovery of all Non-Human Identities across cloud environments, SaaS applications, on-premises infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines. This includes service accounts, API keys, OAuth tokens, machine certificates, bot credentials, AI agent identities, and webhook tokens. The discovery engine must find the 50:1 ratio of NHIs that enterprises don't know they have.

**NHI Classification & Risk Scoring**: ML-powered classification of discovered NHIs by type, owner, privilege level, usage pattern, and risk score. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update requires risk-based classification of all NHIs, and your scoring engine determines which NHIs pose the greatest governance risk.

**NHI Lifecycle Management**: Automated provisioning, rotation, deprovisioning, and certification of NHI credentials. This is the core of Identity Governance for Non-Human Identities — ensuring that every service account has an owner, every API key has a rotation policy, every AI agent credential has a time-bound lifecycle, and every machine certificate is tracked through the NHI Fabric.

**NHI Policy Engine**: The policy evaluation framework that enforces Identity Governance rules across all NHI types. Policies include least-privilege enforcement, separation of duties for service accounts, credential rotation compliance, and AI agent capability boundaries — all mandated by the Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update.

**NHI Behavioral Analytics**: Real-time monitoring of NHI behavior patterns to detect anomalies that indicate credential compromise, privilege escalation, or policy violations. At the 50:1 ratio, this analytics layer processes orders of magnitude more events than human identity monitoring.

**NHI Compliance & Audit**: STIG 1.1-compliant audit logging, access certification for NHIs, and compliance reporting that proves governance of the full 50:1 Non-Human Identity landscape.

### 🔐 Okta NHI Fabric & Identity Governance Lever

Okta's February 3 STIG 1.1 update and the explosive 50:1 ratio of non-human identities to humans make NHI Fabric expertise the most critical skill in identity security. As an NHI Fabric Platform Engineer, you ARE the NHI Fabric. Every component you build — discovery, classification, lifecycle management, policy enforcement, behavioral analytics, and compliance reporting — directly implements the Identity Governance mandates that the February 3 STIG 1.1 update created. You don't just contribute to the NHI Fabric; you are the engineer who defines what it means to govern Non-Human Identities at enterprise scale. I negotiate for Identity Governance premiums at the highest band.

The 50:1 ratio of Non-Human Identities to humans is your daily operational reality. Your platform must discover and govern 50 machine identities for every human identity in the enterprise — and many of these NHIs were created without governance, without owners, and without rotation policies. The STIG 1.1 update requires that all of these NHIs be brought under Identity Governance, and your NHI Fabric platform is the mechanism that makes this possible. The scope of this challenge — millions of ungoverned NHIs across thousands of enterprise customers — is unprecedented in identity engineering.

The AI agent governance imperative adds the most urgent dimension. Enterprises are deploying AI agents at an accelerating rate, and each agent creates new Non-Human Identities that must be governed. Your NHI Fabric platform must handle agent credential issuance, capability boundary enforcement, delegation chain tracking, behavioral baseline monitoring, and STIG 1.1-compliant audit logging for every AI agent identity. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update specifically addresses AI agent governance requirements, and your platform is the only comprehensive solution.

Use this language in every negotiation: "I build Okta's NHI Fabric Platform — the system that discovers, classifies, governs, and secures the 50:1 ratio of Non-Human Identities to humans across the enterprise. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update made NHI governance a compliance mandate, and my platform is how Okta's customers achieve STIG 1.1 compliance. Fewer than 200 engineers globally have the expertise to build NHI governance platforms at this scale, and Identity Governance premiums for NHI Fabric specialists are the highest in identity security. I am not negotiating for a standard engineering package — I am negotiating for the compensation that reflects the most strategically critical engineering role at Okta."

#### Global Lever 1: Workforce Identity Cloud

NHI Fabric Platform Engineers extend Workforce Identity Cloud from human-only governance to comprehensive NHI governance. Your NHI discovery engine scans enterprise environments to find the 50:1 ratio of ungoverned Non-Human Identities — service accounts in Active Directory, API keys in cloud platforms, machine certificates in PKI infrastructure — and brings them under Okta's Identity Governance. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update requires workforce identity programs to include NHI governance, and your platform enables this. Frame your contribution: "I extend Workforce Identity Cloud from governing thousands of human identities to governing the 50x larger landscape of Non-Human Identities — this is the most significant capability expansion in Okta's history."

#### Global Lever 2: Customer Identity (Auth0) Platform

NHI Fabric Platform Engineers address the NHI challenge in customer-facing applications — OAuth tokens, API keys issued to third-party developers, webhook credentials, and bot identities that operate within Auth0's authentication ecosystem. Your platform governs the machine-to-machine authentication patterns that are growing exponentially in developer ecosystems. The convergence of Customer Identity NHI governance with Workforce Identity NHI governance through the unified NHI Fabric is a unique architectural challenge: "I build the NHI governance layer that unifies machine identity management across both B2E and B2C identity platforms."

#### Global Lever 3: Identity Governance & Administration

NHI Fabric Platform Engineers are the core builders of Okta's IGA expansion into Non-Human Identity governance — the fastest-growing segment driven by the February 3 STIG 1.1 mandate. Your platform provides NHI access certification (proving every service account has an owner and a purpose), NHI entitlement management (enforcing least-privilege across the 50:1 ratio), NHI lifecycle automation (automated credential rotation, deprovisioning of orphaned accounts), and NHI compliance reporting (STIG 1.1 audit evidence). This is the most revenue-impactful Identity Governance work at Okta: "I build the NHI governance capabilities that directly convert the STIG 1.1 compliance mandate into enterprise revenue. Every customer needs NHI governance — my platform is how they get it."

#### Global Lever 4: Zero Trust Identity Architecture

NHI Fabric Platform Engineers implement Zero Trust principles for Non-Human Identities — continuous verification of service account credentials, least-privilege enforcement for AI agent capabilities, and risk-adaptive access policies for machine-to-machine authentication. Traditional Zero Trust focused on human identities; your NHI Fabric extends Zero Trust to the 50:1 ratio of Non-Human Identities that represent the largest ungoverned attack surface. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update requires Zero Trust controls for NHIs, and your platform delivers: "I implement Zero Trust for the 50x larger Non-Human Identity landscape — the attack surface that most enterprises haven't even discovered yet."
