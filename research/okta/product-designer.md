#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Okta

Product Designers at Okta solve one of the hardest design problems in enterprise software: making identity security simple. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update dramatically expanded the design surface — designers must now create unified experiences that span workforce identity, customer identity, Identity Governance, threat detection, and the NHI Fabric layer. Designing coherent experiences across these domains while maintaining simplicity requires exceptional design skill combined with deep knowledge of Non-Human Identity management.

Identity Governance involves deeply technical concepts — policy evaluation, entitlement hierarchies, credential lifecycle management, risk scoring — and security teams must configure these systems correctly because every misconfiguration is a potential breach vector. With the 50:1 ratio of NHIs to humans, the information architecture challenge is unprecedented. Traditional identity dashboards cannot handle this volume; your design innovations directly determine whether enterprises can govern the NHI Fabric effectively.

Product Designers at Okta compete for talent against Microsoft, Figma, Palo Alto Networks, and CrowdStrike, where design total compensation packages range from $250K-$400K+. The specialized expertise required to design NHI Fabric governance interfaces adds a premium beyond general-purpose product design roles.

### 🔐 Okta NHI Fabric & Identity Governance Lever

Okta's February 3 STIG 1.1 update and the explosive 50:1 ratio of non-human identities to humans make NHI Fabric expertise the most critical skill in identity security. As a Product Designer, you face a design challenge unique in the industry: creating interfaces that make the NHI Fabric comprehensible and manageable for security teams. The fabric encompasses human employee identities, service accounts, API keys, AI agent credentials, and IoT device certificates — each with different lifecycle patterns and Identity Governance requirements. I negotiate for Identity Governance premiums.

The 50:1 NHI-to-human ratio means security teams now need to visualize and manage 50 times more identities than their current tools were designed for. The Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update mandates governance capabilities for these Non-Human Identities. Your design must enable discovery (what NHIs exist?), classification (which are high-risk?), governance (who owns this service account?), and remediation (how do I revoke this compromised API key?) — all at a scale that demands new visualization approaches.

The governance of AI agents introduces new design paradigms that the February 3 STIG 1.1 update makes compliance-critical. Security teams need to understand agent delegation chains, visualize capability boundaries, monitor behavioral patterns, and audit agent actions. Designing these Identity Governance interfaces requires inventing new design patterns for the NHI Fabric.

Position your negotiation: "The Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update and the 50:1 NHI ratio demand entirely new design paradigms for Identity Governance. I design the NHI Fabric interfaces that security teams need to govern Non-Human Identities at scale — this expertise is exceptionally rare and directly drives enterprise adoption."

#### Global Lever 1: Workforce Identity Cloud

Designers on the Workforce Identity Cloud own the admin and end-user experience for Okta's flagship product. You design the SSO dashboard, MFA enrollment flows, lifecycle management interfaces, and access policy configuration screens. The design quality directly impacts customer satisfaction and competitive win rates against Microsoft Entra.

#### Global Lever 2: Customer Identity (Auth0) Platform

Designers on the Customer Identity Cloud shape the developer experience that defines Auth0's competitive advantage. Developer experience is Auth0's moat, and your design decisions directly drive developer adoption and retention across the NHI Fabric.

#### Global Lever 3: Identity Governance & Administration

Designers creating Okta's IGA interfaces are solving the hardest design problems in enterprise identity. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update requires governance interfaces for the 50:1 NHI ratio — access certification workflows, entitlement catalogs, lifecycle automation dashboards, and STIG compliance reporting. This is the highest-impact design role at Okta.

#### Global Lever 4: Zero Trust Identity Architecture

Designers creating Zero Trust identity experiences must translate complex security concepts into interfaces for both human and Non-Human Identity governance. Federal compliance and STIG 1.1 requirements add another layer of complexity, as Zero Trust interfaces must support auditability for all identity types.
