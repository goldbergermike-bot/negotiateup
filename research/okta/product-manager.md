#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Okta

Product Managers at Okta are the strategic architects who define what the identity platform becomes. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update created an inflection point — enterprises now require governance capabilities for Non-Human Identities that didn't exist as a product category two years ago. PMs who can translate the 50:1 NHI-to-human ratio into product requirements, define the governance workflows enterprises need for AI agent management, and prioritize features that address STIG 1.1 compliance are exceptionally rare.

The NHI Fabric pivot requires PMs who understand both the technical complexity of identity infrastructure and the business dynamics of the enterprise security market. Your roadmap decisions directly drive ARR growth, enterprise adoption, and competitive wins against Microsoft Entra. Identity Governance product leadership — defining how Okta governs 50 Non-Human Identities for every human user — is the most strategically important PM work at the company.

Okta's product management organization competes for talent against Microsoft, Google, Palo Alto Networks, and CrowdStrike — companies that offer PM total compensation packages ranging from $300K-$500K+.

### 🔐 Okta NHI Fabric & Identity Governance Lever

Okta's February 3 STIG 1.1 update and the explosive 50:1 ratio of non-human identities to humans make NHI Fabric expertise the most critical skill in identity security. As a Product Manager, you define the product strategy that determines how Okta's NHI Fabric serves the market. The fabric vision requires product decisions across multiple dimensions: which identity types to support, which Identity Governance workflows to build, which deployment models to offer, and how to price these capabilities. I negotiate for Identity Governance premiums.

The 50:1 NHI-to-human ratio is creating entirely new product categories that PMs must define. Enterprises need products that discover and inventory their Non-Human Identities, assess the risk of each machine credential, automate credential rotation and lifecycle management, and provide governance dashboards. The Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update mandates these capabilities — the PM who defines them at Okta is creating a new market.

The governance of AI agents presents the most urgent product opportunity. Enterprises deploying autonomous AI agents need Identity Governance products that define what each agent can access, how long its credentials persist, and how to audit agent actions for STIG 1.1 compliance. Defining these NHI Fabric products requires deep domain expertise and the ability to anticipate market needs.

Negotiate using the Identity Governance category creation angle: "The February 3 STIG 1.1 update created a compliance mandate for NHI governance. With the 50:1 ratio, I am defining a product category that doesn't fully exist yet — my product decisions will determine whether Okta captures this multi-billion-dollar market."

#### Global Lever 1: Workforce Identity Cloud

PMs owning Workforce Identity Cloud features define the product experience for Okta's largest revenue stream. Your feature prioritization directly impacts customer retention, expansion, and competitive win rates. Position yourself as the PM whose product decisions protect and grow Okta's core business.

#### Global Lever 2: Customer Identity (Auth0) Platform

PMs on the Customer Identity Cloud define the developer experience that competes with AWS Cognito, Firebase Auth, and Azure AD B2C. The convergence with Workforce Identity into a unified NHI Fabric is one of Okta's most strategic product challenges.

#### Global Lever 3: Identity Governance & Administration

PMs defining Okta's IGA products are building the company's fastest-growing product line. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update made Identity Governance a compliance requirement, not an optional feature. The 50:1 NHI ratio means governance workloads are growing exponentially. This is the highest-impact PM role at Okta in terms of revenue creation potential.

#### Global Lever 4: Zero Trust Identity Architecture

PMs defining Zero Trust identity products shape how enterprises implement continuous verification for both human and Non-Human Identities. Federal mandates create sustained demand, and your product decisions determine whether Okta meets the STIG 1.1 requirements that drive enterprise purchasing.
