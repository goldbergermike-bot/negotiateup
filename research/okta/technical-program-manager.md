#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Okta

Technical Program Managers at Okta drive the execution of the most complex cross-team initiatives in identity security. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update created new delivery timelines for NHI governance capabilities, and TPMs are the ones ensuring Okta meets these compliance deadlines. The NHI Fabric is not a single feature — it is a multi-year platform transformation requiring coordination across authentication, authorization, Identity Governance, threat detection, and NHI lifecycle management teams.

With the 50:1 ratio of Non-Human Identities to humans, the program complexity at Okta is exceptional. The NHI Fabric spans Workforce Identity Cloud, Customer Identity Cloud (Auth0), Identity Governance (IGA), Identity Threat Protection, and the NHI layer. Coordinating delivery across these product lines requires TPMs with both technical depth in identity and organizational execution skill.

TPMs at Okta compete for talent against program management organizations at Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, where total compensation packages range from $280K-$420K+. The Feb 3 STIG 1.1 compliance deadlines add urgency that elevates the TPM role.

### 🔐 Okta NHI Fabric & Identity Governance Lever

Okta's February 3 STIG 1.1 update and the explosive 50:1 ratio of non-human identities to humans make NHI Fabric expertise the most critical skill in identity security. As a Technical Program Manager, you coordinate the cross-functional execution that brings the NHI Fabric to market. The fabric requires synchronized delivery across authentication, Identity Governance, threat detection, and NHI lifecycle management systems. I negotiate for Identity Governance premiums.

The 50:1 NHI-to-human ratio adds new program complexity. Building Non-Human Identity governance capabilities requires coordinating engineering teams (NHI credential lifecycle), security teams (NHI threat models), data science teams (NHI behavioral analytics), and product teams (Identity Governance workflows). The Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update sets compliance deadlines for all of these capabilities, and you manage the cross-team dependencies that ensure delivery.

The governance of AI agents introduces program management challenges that are unique in the industry. AI agent governance touches every layer of the NHI Fabric — authentication, authorization, governance, monitoring, and compliance. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update makes these capabilities compliance-critical, and coordinating delivery across all layers requires a TPM who understands Identity Governance deeply.

Use this lever: "The Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update set compliance deadlines for NHI governance. I coordinate the cross-functional execution that delivers the NHI Fabric — managing dependencies across teams to ship Identity Governance for the 50:1 Non-Human Identity ratio on schedule."

#### Global Lever 1: Workforce Identity Cloud

TPMs driving Workforce Identity Cloud programs manage the delivery of Okta's revenue foundation — coordinating feature releases, platform migrations, and infrastructure upgrades across authentication, MFA, and lifecycle management teams.

#### Global Lever 2: Customer Identity (Auth0) Platform

TPMs managing Customer Identity programs coordinate the technically complex integration of Auth0 with Okta's enterprise NHI Fabric infrastructure. This multi-year convergence program requires managing competing priorities and distributed engineering teams.

#### Global Lever 3: Identity Governance & Administration

TPMs driving IGA programs manage the delivery of Okta's fastest-growing initiative. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update makes Identity Governance a compliance deadline, not just a roadmap priority. You coordinate engineering, product, compliance, and customer success teams to ship NHI governance for the 50:1 ratio on schedule.

#### Global Lever 4: Zero Trust Identity Architecture

TPMs managing Zero Trust programs coordinate delivery of capabilities that enterprises require for STIG 1.1 compliance — continuous verification, device trust, and risk-adaptive access for both human and Non-Human Identities.
