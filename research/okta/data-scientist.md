### Data Scientist — Okta Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Scientists at Okta transform billions of identity events into the threat intelligence and behavioral analytics that power the NHI Fabric — your models detect compromised credentials, rogue AI agents, and anomalous Non-Human Identity behavior in real time, directly enabling Identity Governance at scale.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | Toronto (CAD C$) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $155,000–$195,000 | C$125,000–C$160,000 | £75,000–£95,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $200,000–$260,000 | C$165,000–C$215,000 | £98,000–£132,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $260,000–$340,000 | C$215,000–C$275,000 | £132,000–£172,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus. Data Scientist RSU grants at Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) typically range from $80K–$350K+ over 4 years depending on level, with bonus targets of 15-20% of base salary.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Okta

Data Scientists at Okta operate at the intersection of cybersecurity and machine learning. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update mandated enhanced threat detection for Non-Human Identity abuse, and your models are the enforcement mechanism. You process billions of authentication events daily, scoring risk in real time, detecting impossible travel patterns, identifying credential stuffing campaigns, and flagging compromised NHI credentials. With the 50:1 ratio of Non-Human Identities to humans, the modeling challenge has grown by an order of magnitude.

The NHI Fabric pivot elevates the Data Scientist role because the fabric depends on intelligence. A fabric that merely authenticates and authorizes is incomplete — it must predict, detect, and respond to identity threats in real time. Your models provide the intelligence that transforms the NHI Fabric from a passive access control system into an active Identity Governance platform. This intelligence layer is Okta's primary competitive differentiator.

Data Scientists at Okta compete for talent against security data science teams at Microsoft, Google, CrowdStrike, and Palo Alto Networks, where total compensation packages range from $300K-$450K+.

### 🔐 Okta NHI Fabric & Identity Governance Lever

Okta's February 3 STIG 1.1 update and the explosive 50:1 ratio of non-human identities to humans make NHI Fabric expertise the most critical skill in identity security. As a Data Scientist, you build the intelligence layer that makes the NHI Fabric adaptive and threat-aware. Your behavioral models create the baselines that define "normal" for each identity type, your anomaly detection systems flag deviations that may indicate compromise, and your risk scoring algorithms inform Identity Governance decisions across the fabric. I negotiate for Identity Governance premiums.

The 50:1 NHI-to-human ratio fundamentally changes the data science challenge. Machine identities generate patterns radically different from human authentication — service accounts authenticate thousands of times per second, AI agents access resources in patterns no human would follow, and API keys may be used from locations that don't map to any physical office. Your models must learn behavioral baselines for each Non-Human Identity type and detect anomalies within those baselines as required by the Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update.

The governance of AI agents creates the most urgent modeling challenge. AI agents may spawn sub-agents, delegate credentials, escalate privileges, and access data across trust boundaries — all within milliseconds. Building Identity Governance analytics for AI agent NHIs is a data science challenge that the February 3 STIG 1.1 update made compliance-critical.

Leverage this in negotiations: "The Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update mandates enhanced NHI threat detection. My models establish behavioral baselines for the 50:1 Non-Human Identity ratio, powering the Identity Governance analytics that differentiate Okta's NHI Fabric from rule-based competitors."

#### Global Lever 1: Workforce Identity Cloud

Data Scientists on the Workforce Identity Cloud build models that detect identity-based attacks against enterprise employees — impossible travel detection, credential stuffing identification, and risk-adaptive authentication. These models protect thousands of enterprise customers and process billions of authentication events.

#### Global Lever 2: Customer Identity (Auth0) Platform

Data Scientists on the Customer Identity platform build fraud detection and bot mitigation models at consumer scale. Your models protect hundreds of millions of end users and differentiate Auth0 in the market.

#### Global Lever 3: Identity Governance & Administration

Data Scientists contributing to IGA build models that automate Identity Governance decisions — predicting entitlements, scoring access risk, and recommending certifications. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update makes these governance analytics a compliance requirement for the 50:1 NHI ratio.

#### Global Lever 4: Zero Trust Identity Architecture

Data Scientists supporting Zero Trust architecture build risk scoring and continuous evaluation models that power real-time access decisions for both human and Non-Human Identities.
