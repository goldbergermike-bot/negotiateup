### Security Engineer — Okta Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers at Okta are the defensive architects of the identity platform itself — building the security controls, threat detection systems, and vulnerability defenses that protect the NHI Fabric from sophisticated attacks targeting the 50:1 Non-Human Identity attack surface, directly enabling Identity Governance at enterprise scale.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | Toronto (CAD C$) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $170,000–$215,000 | C$138,000–C$175,000 | £80,000–£102,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $220,000–$280,000 | C$180,000–C$228,000 | £105,000–£135,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $280,000–$360,000 | C$228,000–C$290,000 | £135,000–£175,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus. Security Engineer RSU grants at Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) typically range from $100K-$350K+ over 4 years. Security roles carry a 10-15% premium over equivalent SWE levels.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Okta

Security Engineers at Okta occupy a unique position: they secure the platform that secures everyone else. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update redefined compliance requirements for Non-Human Identity security controls, and Security Engineers are responsible for implementing these defenses across the NHI Fabric. With the 50:1 ratio of NHIs to human identities, the attack surface for credential compromise has expanded by an order of magnitude — every service account, API key, and AI agent credential is a potential breach vector.

The NHI Fabric pivot expands the security attack surface dramatically. Previously, Security Engineers focused on protecting SSO and MFA infrastructure. Now, the fabric encompasses workforce identity, customer identity, Identity Governance, threat detection, and NHI management — each introducing new vulnerability classes that the Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update requires defenses against.

Security Engineers at Okta compete for talent against security teams at Microsoft, Google, CrowdStrike, and Palo Alto Networks, where total compensation packages range from $320K-$480K+. The identity platform criticality and STIG 1.1 compliance requirements create additional premium positioning.

#### Okta Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Okta Level | Internal Title | External Equivalent |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| SEC3 | Security Engineer | Mid-level Security Engineer |
| SEC4 | Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Engineer |
| SEC5 | Staff Security Engineer | Staff / Lead Security Engineer |
| SEC6 | Principal Security Engineer | Principal Security Engineer |

*Security Engineers at Okta are mapped to a dedicated security IC track with compensation bands 10-15% above equivalent engineering levels.*

### 🔐 Okta NHI Fabric & Identity Governance Lever

Okta's February 3 STIG 1.1 update and the explosive 50:1 ratio of non-human identities to humans make NHI Fabric expertise the most critical skill in identity security. As a Security Engineer, you protect the NHI Fabric itself — the unified identity control plane that thousands of enterprises trust with their most sensitive access decisions. A compromise of Okta's platform cascades to every connected enterprise, making your defensive work the most consequential security engineering in the identity industry. I negotiate for Identity Governance premiums.

The 50:1 NHI-to-human ratio introduces threat vectors that the Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update specifically addresses. Attackers targeting service account credentials gain persistent privileged access without triggering human-focused detection. Compromised AI agent identities perform lateral movement at machine speed. Stolen API keys are used from any location without geographic anomaly flagging. Your threat models must account for these Non-Human Identity attack patterns as mandated by STIG 1.1.

The AI agent security challenge is particularly acute. AI agents may be compromised through prompt injection, model manipulation, or credential theft — attack vectors that the February 3 STIG 1.1 update requires new defenses for. Security Engineers building NHI Fabric defenses against AI agent identity compromise are pioneering a new security discipline within Identity Governance.

Frame your negotiation: "The Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update mandates NHI security controls at enterprise scale. I secure the NHI Fabric against the 50:1 Non-Human Identity attack surface — including AI agent credential theft and service account abuse. This Identity Governance security expertise is the scarcest and most valuable in cybersecurity."

#### Global Lever 1: Workforce Identity Cloud

Security Engineers protecting the Workforce Identity Cloud defend Okta's revenue foundation against the most sophisticated identity attacks. Your security controls protect authentication flows, session management, and credential storage from nation-state actors. Position your work as protecting Okta's customer trust.

#### Global Lever 2: Customer Identity (Auth0) Platform

Security Engineers on the Customer Identity platform defend against consumer-scale attack patterns — credential stuffing, account takeover, and bot attacks. Your security controls protect hundreds of millions of end users across the NHI Fabric.

#### Global Lever 3: Identity Governance & Administration

Security Engineers ensuring the integrity of IGA systems protect the Identity Governance layer that enforces access policies. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update requires security controls that prevent attackers from manipulating NHI governance decisions at the 50:1 ratio. A compromise of governance infrastructure could allow privilege escalation across Non-Human Identities.

#### Global Lever 4: Zero Trust Identity Architecture

Security Engineers build the security controls that enable continuous verification for both human and Non-Human Identities — device trust validation, risk signal processing, and STIG 1.1-compliant access policy enforcement.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $255,000 base with 3,200 RSUs (~$304,000 at OKTA ~$95). Accept-at floor: $430,000 total comp. Cite the February 3 STIG 1.1 update, the 50:1 NHI ratio, and your Identity Governance security expertise. The 10-15% security premium reflects specialized NHI threat modeling. For Toronto, open at C$210,000 base; for London, open at £128,000 base.
