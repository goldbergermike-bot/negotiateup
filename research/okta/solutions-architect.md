*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus. Solutions Architect RSU grants at Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) typically range from $80K–$300K+ over 4 years, with deal-based performance bonuses that can significantly increase total compensation.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Okta

Solutions Architects at Okta are the technical strategists who bridge the gap between the NHI Fabric platform and enterprise customer needs. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update created new compliance requirements that every enterprise deployment must address, and SAs are the ones designing architectures that demonstrate STIG 1.1 compliance for Non-Human Identity governance. With the 50:1 ratio of NHIs to humans, every enterprise deployment now requires NHI lifecycle management architecture — a capability that no competitor can demonstrate today.

Your technical designs directly influence deal sizes — a well-architected identity deployment that includes NHI Fabric governance can expand from a $500K initial deal to a multi-million-dollar platform commitment. You demonstrate to enterprise prospects that Okta's unified fabric can replace their fragmented identity stacks with a single Identity Governance platform.

Solutions Architects at Okta compete for talent against pre-sales engineering organizations at Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, and ServiceNow, where total compensation packages range from $300K-$450K+.

### 🔐 Okta NHI Fabric & Identity Governance Lever

Okta's February 3 STIG 1.1 update and the explosive 50:1 ratio of non-human identities to humans make NHI Fabric expertise the most critical skill in identity security. As a Solutions Architect, you are the first person to show enterprise customers what the NHI Fabric means for their organization. You design the deployment architectures that demonstrate how Okta governs every identity type — human employees, service accounts, API keys, AI agents — through a single Identity Governance platform. I negotiate for Identity Governance premiums.

The 50:1 NHI-to-human ratio is transforming every enterprise deployment conversation. Customers are discovering that their Non-Human Identities — service accounts with standing privileges, API keys that never rotate, machine credentials with no ownership — represent massive security risks that violate STIG 1.1 requirements. You design the NHI Fabric architecture that brings these Non-Human Identities under Okta's Identity Governance.

The governance of AI agents is the newest design challenge accelerated by the February 3 STIG 1.1 update. Enterprises deploying AI agents need identity architectures that govern what each agent can access, enforce least-privilege policies, and provide STIG-compliant audit trails. As a Solutions Architect, you design these NHI governance architectures — a capability that no competitor can demonstrate today.

Negotiate using deployment expertise: "The Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update mandates NHI governance at every enterprise. I design the NHI Fabric deployment architectures that show customers how to govern the 50:1 Non-Human Identity ratio. My technical designs directly drive deal sizes and competitive wins for Identity Governance."

#### Global Lever 1: Workforce Identity Cloud

Solutions Architects designing Workforce Identity Cloud deployments own the technical relationship with Okta's largest enterprise customers. Your integration architectures and deployment plans determine how quickly enterprises adopt Okta's platform.

#### Global Lever 2: Customer Identity (Auth0) Platform

Solutions Architects designing Customer Identity deployments architect both B2E and B2C identity solutions, navigating the NHI Fabric across both platforms. The convergence creates unique architectural value.

#### Global Lever 3: Identity Governance & Administration

Solutions Architects designing IGA deployments are the most strategically valuable SAs at Okta. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update makes Identity Governance a compliance requirement. You design access certification architectures and NHI lifecycle management frameworks for the 50:1 ratio. This directly enables Okta's TAM expansion.

#### Global Lever 4: Zero Trust Identity Architecture

Solutions Architects designing Zero Trust deployments enable enterprises to meet STIG 1.1 compliance requirements. Your architectures integrate device trust, continuous verification, and risk-adaptive access for both human and Non-Human Identities.
