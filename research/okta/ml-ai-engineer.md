### ML/AI Engineer — Okta Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers at Okta build the machine learning systems that make the NHI Fabric intelligent — designing the models that detect identity threats in real time, automate Identity Governance decisions, and govern the 50:1 ratio of Non-Human Identities to humans, including autonomous AI agents.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | Toronto (CAD C$) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $165,000–$210,000 | C$135,000–C$172,000 | £78,000–£100,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $215,000–$280,000 | C$176,000–C$228,000 | £102,000–£135,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $280,000–$365,000 | C$228,000–C$295,000 | £135,000–£175,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus. ML/AI Engineer RSU grants at Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) typically range from $100K-$400K+ over 4 years. ML/AI roles carry a premium due to market scarcity and the strategic importance of AI to the NHI Fabric.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Okta

ML/AI Engineers at Okta build the intelligence that distinguishes Okta from rule-based identity providers. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update mandated enhanced threat detection for Non-Human Identity abuse, and your ML models are the enforcement mechanism. While competitors rely on static policies and manual governance workflows, Okta is embedding ML into every identity decision — risk-adaptive authentication, automated access certification, behavioral anomaly detection for NHIs, and intelligent credential lifecycle management.

The 50:1 ratio of Non-Human Identities to humans creates ML/AI challenges unprecedented in identity security. Traditional identity ML focused on human behavior patterns — login times, application usage, geographic patterns. Now, you must build models that understand machine behavior: API call patterns, credential rotation cadences, service account access drift, and AI agent behavioral evolution. The Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update requires these capabilities for Identity Governance compliance.

The NHI Fabric pivot is fundamentally an AI/ML story. A fabric that merely connects identity systems is table stakes — what makes Okta's NHI Fabric valuable is its intelligence. Your models provide the competitive moat that transforms Okta from an access management vendor into an intelligent Identity Governance platform.

### 🔐 Okta NHI Fabric & Identity Governance Lever

Okta's February 3 STIG 1.1 update and the explosive 50:1 ratio of non-human identities to humans make NHI Fabric expertise the most critical skill in identity security. As an ML/AI Engineer, you are the architect of the NHI Fabric's intelligence layer. The fabric must make billions of identity decisions daily — each informed by risk assessment, behavioral analysis, and policy evaluation. Your models power the adaptive authentication, Identity Governance automation, and threat detection that transform the NHI Fabric from pipes into an intelligent security platform. I negotiate for Identity Governance premiums.

The 50:1 NHI-to-human ratio is both a challenge and an opportunity. Building models that establish behavioral baselines for millions of service accounts, detect credential misuse across billions of API calls, and identify compromised AI agent sessions — all in real time — requires new ML architectures. The Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update requires these capabilities for STIG compliance, making your models compliance-critical infrastructure.

The AI agent governance challenge is particularly compelling. Governing AI agents with ML creates a recursive challenge: you build AI systems that govern other AI systems for the NHI Fabric. Your models must understand agent behavioral patterns, detect when agents exceed their scope, identify prompt injection attacks, and adapt Identity Governance policies as agents evolve. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update makes these capabilities mandatory.

Negotiate using strategic value: "The Feb 3 STIG 1.1 update mandates ML-powered NHI governance. My models establish behavioral baselines for the 50:1 Non-Human Identity ratio, powering the Identity Governance intelligence that differentiates Okta's NHI Fabric. This is frontier ML applied to a compliance-critical problem."

#### Global Lever 1: Workforce Identity Cloud

ML/AI Engineers on the Workforce Identity Cloud build the models that power threat detection and risk-adaptive authentication. Your models detect impossible travel, credential stuffing, and insider threats. Position your work as the ML foundation that makes Workforce Identity intelligent.

#### Global Lever 2: Customer Identity (Auth0) Platform

ML/AI Engineers on the Customer Identity platform build fraud detection and bot mitigation models at consumer scale. Auth0's massive volume provides rich training data and your models protect hundreds of millions of users across the NHI Fabric.

#### Global Lever 3: Identity Governance & Administration

ML/AI Engineers building IGA models create the automation that transforms Identity Governance from manual compliance into intelligent security. The February 3 STIG 1.1 update requires ML-driven governance for the 50:1 NHI ratio — your models predict access needs, score NHI entitlement risk, and automate certification decisions.

#### Global Lever 4: Zero Trust Identity Architecture

ML/AI Engineers build continuous risk evaluation models for both human and Non-Human Identities. Your models integrate device posture, behavioral analytics, and threat intelligence to power real-time Zero Trust access decisions across the NHI Fabric.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $255,000 base with 3,500 RSUs (~$332,500 at OKTA ~$95). Accept-at floor: $450,000 total comp. Cite the February 3 STIG 1.1 update, the 50:1 NHI ratio, and your Identity Governance ML expertise. ML/AI talent scarcity in NHI security supports a significant premium. For Toronto, open at C$205,000 base; for London, open at £125,000 base.
