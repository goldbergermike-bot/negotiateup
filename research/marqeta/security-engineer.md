**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Marqeta protect the modern card issuing platform that moves billions of dollars for Block (Cash App), DoorDash, Affirm, and Uber. This is not application security for a consumer app — this is financial infrastructure security where a breach has immediate monetary, regulatory, and reputational consequences. You are the guardian of the "Water Economy," ensuring that as finance flows like water through every application, it flows securely. Marqeta operates under PCI-DSS Level 1 compliance, banking regulatory requirements, and the security expectations of the world's largest fintech platforms. The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership adds another layer of security scrutiny, as Mastercard's network security standards must be met and maintained continuously.

In the Embedded 2.0 era, Security Engineers at Marqeta are Infrastructure Orchestrator protectors. Every new API capability, every new customer integration, and every new financial product feature expands the attack surface. Just-in-time funding, tokenization, real-time authorization, and programmable spend controls all require security architectures that protect money movement without adding latency or friction. With $600M+ in revenue flowing through systems you protect, a single security failure can cost Marqeta millions in direct loss, regulatory penalties, and customer trust. As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, the security challenge intensifies with each new capability. Your compensation must reflect that Security Engineers at a payments-critical Infrastructure Orchestrator bear responsibility for protecting real money in real time — a fundamentally higher-stakes mandate than typical application security.

### Embedded 2.0 — The Infrastructure Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Financial Infrastructure Protection Stakes:** "Security engineering at Marqeta is not standard application security. I'm protecting a platform that processes real money in real time for 100M+ end users. A vulnerability in my domain could result in direct financial loss, PCI-DSS compliance failure, and regulatory action. The blast radius of a security incident at an Infrastructure Orchestrator like Marqeta is orders of magnitude higher than at a typical SaaS company. I'm requesting a base salary of $225,000 to reflect the financial infrastructure security premium."

**Lever 2 — Mastercard Partnership Security Compliance:** "The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership subjects Marqeta to Mastercard's network security standards on top of existing PCI-DSS and banking regulatory requirements. As a Security Engineer, I'm responsible for ensuring Marqeta meets these multi-layered compliance obligations while maintaining platform velocity. I bring [PCI-DSS / payments security / network security] expertise that directly de-risks the partnership. I'd like my RSU grant at $200,000 over four years to align with the partnership's compliance timeline and the equity upside it enables."

**Lever 3 — Water Economy Security Architecture:** "Marqeta's Water Economy vision — finance flowing through every application — means the security perimeter is not a wall but a membrane that must protect money movement while allowing frictionless integration. Designing security architectures for this model is fundamentally harder than perimeter-based security. I need to secure APIs, tokenization systems, real-time authorization paths, and just-in-time funding flows simultaneously. I'm asking for total comp at the 70th percentile — $450,000 — to reflect this architectural complexity."

**Lever 4 — Complexity Curve Security Expansion:** "As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, each new capability — embedded lending, multi-currency, programmable controls — introduces new threat models and compliance requirements. The security surface area is growing exponentially. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $35,000-$50,000 to reflect the extreme scarcity of security engineers with payments infrastructure experience and PCI-DSS expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $225,000 base for Oakland/NYC and push for $200,000 in RSU grants (4-year vest). Lead with the Infrastructure Orchestrator security premium: "I'm protecting financial infrastructure that processes billions in volume — a security incident at Marqeta has immediate monetary, regulatory, and reputational consequences." Reference the Mastercard partnership as adding compliance complexity and increasing the value of security expertise. If they counter below $200,000 base, negotiate for a $40,000 sign-on bonus and a compliance certification stipend. Your accept-at floor should be $195,000 base + $160,000 RSU for Oakland/NYC, or $175,000 base + $140,000 RSU for Remote. Frame every counter around the Embedded 2.0 security premium: protecting real money in real time at a PCI-DSS Level 1 Infrastructure Orchestrator demands premium compensation.
