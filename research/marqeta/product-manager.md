**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Marqeta own the roadmap for the modern card issuing platform that powers the embedded finance ecosystem. This is not a typical product management role — you are defining the product strategy for infrastructure that processes billions of dollars for Block (Cash App), DoorDash, Affirm, and Uber. Every product decision you make ripples through the entire fintech stack. When you define a new API capability, you are literally creating the channels through which the "Water Economy" flows. The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership has elevated the product strategy from serving individual customers to architecting the embedded finance platform layer for the entire payments industry, and Product Managers are the ones who translate that partnership into shipped capabilities.

Marqeta's Embedded 2.0 vision requires Product Managers who understand both the technical depth of payments infrastructure and the business dynamics of platform economics. You are managing a product that is simultaneously a real-time transaction processor, a developer platform, a compliance framework, and a revenue engine. The just-in-time funding model that differentiates Marqeta is a product innovation as much as a technical one, and your ability to extend that innovation up the complexity curve determines Marqeta's competitive moat. With $600M+ in revenue, every product decision carries material financial weight. As an Infrastructure Orchestrator PM, you are shaping how money moves through the digital economy — your compensation should reflect the outsized strategic impact of that work.

### Embedded 2.0 — The Infrastructure Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Platform Product Complexity:** "Product management at Marqeta is fundamentally different from typical SaaS PM work. I'm defining the product strategy for infrastructure that processes real money in real time — every feature I ship has immediate financial, regulatory, and reliability implications for customers like Cash App and DoorDash. The Infrastructure Orchestrator PM role requires deep payments domain expertise combined with API platform product sense. I'm requesting a base salary of $220,000 to reflect this complexity premium."

**Lever 2 — Mastercard Partnership Product Strategy:** "The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership is the most important product strategy vector at Marqeta. As a Product Manager, I'll be defining the product capabilities that make this partnership scale — from co-branded API products to joint go-to-market features. I bring [relevant experience in partner product strategy / payments product management] that directly accelerates this work. I'd like my RSU grant at $230,000 over four years to align my equity upside with the partnership's product delivery milestones."

**Lever 3 — Water Economy Product Vision:** "Marqeta's Water Economy thesis requires a product strategy that makes financial infrastructure as invisible and ubiquitous as water infrastructure. At the PM level, I'm responsible for translating that vision into developer-facing APIs, customer-facing dashboards, and infrastructure capabilities that let any company embed financial services. This product scope is broader and more technically demanding than standard platform PM roles. I'm asking for total comp at the 70th percentile — $475,000 — to reflect the Water Economy product premium."

**Lever 4 — Complexity Curve Product Innovation:** "As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, the product roadmap expands into embedded lending, multi-currency settlement, programmable spend controls, and real-time risk decisioning. Each of these product areas is a new revenue line. I bring experience in [relevant product domain] that accelerates Marqeta's expansion along the complexity curve. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $35,000-$50,000 and a performance-based bonus target of 20% to reflect the direct revenue impact of my product decisions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $220,000 base for Oakland/NYC and push for $230,000 in RSU grants (4-year vest). Lead with the Infrastructure Orchestrator framing: "PM work at Marqeta is not standard SaaS product management — I'm defining the product strategy for payments infrastructure that powers the world's largest consumer fintech apps." Reference the Mastercard partnership as both a product scope expansion and an equity catalyst. If they counter below $200,000 base, negotiate for a $40,000 sign-on bonus and a 20% bonus target. Your accept-at floor should be $195,000 base + $180,000 RSU for Oakland/NYC, or $175,000 base + $150,000 RSU for Remote. Frame every counter around the Embedded 2.0 product premium: you are one of the PMs who will define how embedded finance works for the next decade.
