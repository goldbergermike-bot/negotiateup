**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Marqeta build the intelligence layer that makes the modern card issuing platform smarter, faster, and more secure. Every transaction processed for Block (Cash App), DoorDash, Affirm, and Uber passes through models that you build and maintain — fraud detection models that evaluate risk in milliseconds, authorization optimization models that maximize approval rates, and transaction intelligence models that power customer analytics. You are the algorithmic engine of the "Water Economy," building the intelligence that determines how finance flows through every application. The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership gives Marqeta access to network-level signal data that dramatically expands what ML models can learn, and ML/AI Engineers are the ones who turn that expanded signal into competitive advantage.

In the Embedded 2.0 era, ML/AI is not a feature at Marqeta — it is the differentiation layer. Legacy card processors rely on rules-based systems for authorization and fraud detection. Marqeta's Infrastructure Orchestrator advantage is that intelligence is embedded at every decision point in the transaction path. Just-in-time funding decisions, real-time risk scoring, dynamic spend controls, and predictive customer behavior — all of these require ML models that operate at payment-speed latency with financial-grade accuracy. With $600M+ in revenue, even marginal improvements in fraud detection or authorization optimization translate to millions in value. As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, ML/AI Engineers are the ones who make each new capability intelligent from day one. Your compensation should reflect that ML/AI at a payments Infrastructure Orchestrator combines the technical demands of real-time inference with the financial stakes of protecting and optimizing real money movement.

### Embedded 2.0 — The Infrastructure Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Real-Time Financial ML Stakes:** "ML/AI engineering at Marqeta is not offline model training on marketing data. I'm building models that make real-time authorization and fraud decisions on live transactions — every millisecond of latency I add and every false positive my model generates has immediate financial consequences for Cash App, DoorDash, and Uber. The Infrastructure Orchestrator ML premium — real-time inference on real money — warrants a base salary of $240,000, competitive with what Stripe and Block pay for payments ML engineers."

**Lever 2 — Mastercard Partnership Signal Expansion:** "The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership gives Marqeta access to network-level transaction signals that no standalone issuer-processor has. As an ML/AI Engineer, I'll be building models that leverage this expanded feature space to create fraud detection and authorization intelligence that competitors cannot replicate. This data moat is the technical core of Embedded 2.0. I'd like my RSU grant at $250,000 over four years because my models will directly create the differentiation that the Mastercard partnership was designed to enable."

**Lever 3 — Water Economy Intelligence Layer:** "Marqeta's Water Economy vision requires intelligence at every point where finance flows through an application. Smart authorization, adaptive fraud detection, predictive funding, and intelligent routing — all require ML models that operate at scale with financial-grade precision. Building this intelligence layer is one of the hardest ML engineering challenges in fintech. I'm asking for total comp at the 75th percentile — $520,000 — to reflect the Water Economy intelligence premium."

**Lever 4 — Complexity Curve ML Expansion:** "As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, every new capability needs its own ML intelligence: embedded lending needs credit risk models, multi-currency needs FX prediction, programmable controls need anomaly detection, and real-time risk needs adaptive scoring. I bring experience in [real-time ML systems / fraud modeling / financial AI] that directly accelerates this expansion. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $40,000-$60,000 and a guaranteed first-year RSU refresh of $50,000 to reflect the extreme scarcity of ML engineers with payments infrastructure experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $240,000 base for Oakland/NYC and push for $250,000 in RSU grants (4-year vest). ML/AI Engineers at Marqeta should benchmark against Stripe, Block, and Meta ML compensation, not generic fintech data roles. Lead with the Infrastructure Orchestrator intelligence premium: "My models make real-time financial decisions on billions in transaction volume — this is not experimental ML, this is production-critical payments intelligence." Reference the Mastercard partnership as creating a unique data advantage that makes your ML work more valuable. If they counter below $215,000 base, negotiate for a $50,000 sign-on bonus, a guaranteed annual RSU refresh of $40,000-$50,000, and a 15% bonus target. Your accept-at floor should be $210,000 base + $200,000 RSU for Oakland/NYC, or $190,000 base + $170,000 RSU for Remote. Frame every counter around the Embedded 2.0 intelligence premium: ML at a payments Infrastructure Orchestrator is real-time, production-critical, and directly tied to revenue — the scarcest and most valuable form of applied ML.
