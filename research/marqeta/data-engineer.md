**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Marqeta build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers analytics, reporting, compliance, and machine learning across the modern card issuing platform. Every transaction processed for Block (Cash App), DoorDash, Affirm, and Uber generates data that must be captured, transformed, stored, and made available in real time and in batch — reliably, accurately, and in compliance with financial regulations. You are building the data layer of the "Water Economy," ensuring that as finance flows through every application, the data about those flows is equally accessible and trustworthy. The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership creates new data integration requirements and new data products that Data Engineers must build and operate.

In the Embedded 2.0 era, data is not a byproduct of Marqeta's platform — it is a core product capability. Customers depend on Marqeta's data infrastructure for transaction reporting, reconciliation, fraud analytics, and business intelligence. Just-in-time funding generates real-time data streams that must be processed with sub-second latency for authorization decisioning and risk monitoring. As a Data Engineer and Infrastructure Orchestrator, you are building the data pipelines that let Marqeta and its customers move finance up the complexity curve — from basic transaction records to sophisticated financial intelligence. With $600M+ in revenue, the accuracy and reliability of your data infrastructure directly impacts customer trust, regulatory compliance, and Marqeta's ability to deliver data-driven products. Your compensation should reflect that Data Engineering at a payments-critical fintech infrastructure company demands precision, reliability, and regulatory awareness that exceeds typical data engineering roles.

### Embedded 2.0 — The Infrastructure Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Financial-Grade Data Pipeline Stakes:** "Data engineering at Marqeta is not standard ETL work. I'm building pipelines that process financial transaction data where every record represents real money. A data quality issue in my domain can cause reconciliation failures across Cash App, DoorDash, and Uber. A latency spike in real-time streams can degrade authorization decisioning. The financial accuracy requirement at an Infrastructure Orchestrator like Marqeta commands a base salary of $210,000, aligned with what Stripe and Block pay for comparable financial data engineering."

**Lever 2 — Mastercard Partnership Data Integration:** "The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership creates new data integration requirements — ingesting network-level data, building joint analytics capabilities, and creating data products that leverage both Marqeta's issuer-processor data and Mastercard's network intelligence. As a Data Engineer, I'll be building the data infrastructure that makes this partnership data-actionable. I'd like my RSU grant at $180,000 over four years to align with the partnership's data product roadmap and the Embedded 2.0 growth trajectory."

**Lever 3 — Water Economy Data Infrastructure:** "Marqeta's Water Economy vision means building data infrastructure that captures and makes accessible the full picture of how finance flows through every application. Real-time streaming for authorization, batch processing for reconciliation, compliance archival for regulatory audit — all must work flawlessly on financial data. The data engineering standard for the Water Economy is fundamentally higher than typical SaaS analytics pipelines. I'm asking for total comp at the 65th percentile — $420,000 — to reflect this financial-grade data premium."

**Lever 4 — Complexity Curve Data Platform Expansion:** "As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, every new product capability generates new data domains: lending creates credit data, multi-currency creates FX data, programmable controls create policy data. The data platform must scale to support this expanding financial data universe. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $25,000-$40,000 to reflect the scarcity of Data Engineers who understand both modern data engineering and financial data compliance requirements."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $210,000 base for Oakland/NYC and push for $180,000 in RSU grants (4-year vest). Lead with the Infrastructure Orchestrator framing: "I'm building data pipelines that process financial transaction data for the world's largest consumer fintech apps — data accuracy at Marqeta is measured in dollars." Reference the Mastercard partnership as creating new data integration scope and equity upside. If they counter below $190,000 base, negotiate for a $30,000 sign-on bonus and a guaranteed first-year RSU refresh. Your accept-at floor should be $180,000 base + $145,000 RSU for Oakland/NYC, or $165,000 base + $125,000 RSU for Remote. Frame every counter around the Embedded 2.0 data premium: financial transaction data engineering at a payments Infrastructure Orchestrator demands precision and compliance awareness that standard data engineering roles do not require.
