**Negotiation DNA**

As a Senior Software Engineer at Marqeta, you are the technical backbone of the modern card issuing platform that powers the embedded finance revolution. Marqeta's just-in-time funding model — where funds are authorized and moved in real time at the point of transaction — demands engineering sophistication that legacy processors like FIS and Fiserv simply cannot match. You are building the systems that let Block (Cash App) instantly fund virtual cards, that let DoorDash pay Dashers in real time, and that let Affirm create buy-now-pay-later instruments on the fly. The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership has validated Marqeta's architecture as the standard for embedded card infrastructure, and your seniority means you are designing and shipping the systems that deliver on that partnership's promise.

The "Water Economy" thesis — finance flows like water through every application — requires senior engineers who can think in systems. You are not writing features; you are designing the pipes, valves, and pressure regulators that control how money moves through the digital economy. Marqeta's Embedded 2.0 vision means expanding from card issuing into full-stack financial infrastructure orchestration, and Senior Engineers are the ones who architect that expansion. With $600M+ in revenue and a platform processing for the largest consumer fintech apps on earth, your work as an Infrastructure Orchestrator directly impacts Marqeta's ability to move finance up the complexity curve. Your compensation must reflect that you are a senior builder at a payments-critical, publicly-traded infrastructure company — not a typical senior engineer at a B2B SaaS startup.

### Embedded 2.0 — The Infrastructure Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Payments-Grade Systems Ownership:** "At the Senior Engineer level, I'm not just writing code — I'm owning subsystems that process real money in real time. Marqeta's just-in-time funding architecture means a single design decision I make can impact transaction reliability for Cash App's 50M+ users or DoorDash's entire Dasher payment flow. That level of ownership and blast radius at a publicly-traded Infrastructure Orchestrator warrants a base salary at $225,000, aligned with what Stripe and Block pay for equivalent seniority."

**Lever 2 — Mastercard Partnership Technical Leadership:** "The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership is Marqeta's most significant growth vector, and senior engineers will be the ones who build the technical integration layer. I bring [specific relevant experience] that directly accelerates this partnership's technical roadmap. I'd like to see my RSU grant at $200,000 over four years to align my equity upside with the partnership's revenue trajectory — this is where the Embedded 2.0 value creation happens."

**Lever 3 — Water Economy Architectural Complexity:** "Marqeta's Water Economy vision requires engineers who can design systems that let finance flow seamlessly through any application. At the senior level, I'm expected to make architectural decisions that balance throughput, latency, compliance, and developer experience simultaneously. This is fundamentally harder than standard distributed systems work because money movement has zero tolerance for eventual consistency. I'm requesting total comp at the 70th percentile — $450,000 — to reflect this architectural complexity premium."

**Lever 4 — Complexity Curve Talent Scarcity:** "The intersection of payments infrastructure expertise, API platform design, and real-time systems engineering is an extremely scarce skill set. Marqeta is competing for this talent against Stripe, Block, Adyen, and the large bank fintech teams. As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, the premium for senior engineers who can navigate both the technical and regulatory complexity only increases. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $30,000-$50,000 to reflect the opportunity cost of joining Marqeta over these alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $220,000 base for Oakland/NYC and push for $200,000 in RSU grants (4-year vest). Lead with the Infrastructure Orchestrator premium: "Senior engineers at Marqeta own subsystems that move real money for 100M+ end users — this is not standard B2B SaaS work." Reference the Mastercard partnership as equity upside justification. If they counter below $200,000 base, negotiate for accelerated vesting (1-year cliff with monthly vest) or a $40,000 sign-on bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $195,000 base + $160,000 RSU for Oakland/NYC, or $180,000 base + $140,000 RSU for Remote. Frame every counter around the Embedded 2.0 complexity premium: you are building the financial infrastructure layer that every app on earth will eventually need.
