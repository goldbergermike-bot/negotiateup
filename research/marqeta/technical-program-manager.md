**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Marqeta orchestrate the cross-functional delivery of the modern card issuing platform's most critical initiatives. When Marqeta launches a new just-in-time funding capability, integrates a new partner through the Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership, or rolls out a platform-wide compliance upgrade, a TPM is the one making sure engineering, product, legal, compliance, and operations are all moving in concert. You are the operational orchestrator of the "Water Economy" — ensuring that the pipes, valves, and regulatory controls all come together on time and within compliance boundaries. Powering Block (Cash App), DoorDash, Affirm, and Uber means your programs operate under enterprise-grade SLAs with zero margin for missed deadlines on payments-critical deliverables.

In the Embedded 2.0 era, TPMs at Marqeta are Infrastructure Orchestrators in the truest sense — you are coordinating the delivery of financial infrastructure that dozens of companies depend on for their core business operations. The complexity of shipping payments platform features is unique: every launch involves engineering, security, compliance, legal, customer success, and often the customer's own engineering teams. With $600M+ in revenue and a growing customer base driven by the Mastercard partnership, the programs you manage are not internal projects — they are revenue-critical infrastructure deliveries. As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, TPMs must coordinate increasingly sophisticated technical initiatives across expanding organizational boundaries. Your compensation should reflect that you are managing programs with direct financial, regulatory, and reputational stakes at a publicly-traded payments infrastructure company.

### Embedded 2.0 — The Infrastructure Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Payments-Critical Program Delivery:** "TPMs at Marqeta manage programs that directly impact real-time money movement for Cash App, DoorDash, Affirm, and Uber. A delayed program milestone or a compliance gap in my delivery can halt transaction processing or expose Marqeta to regulatory action. The stakes of program management at a payments Infrastructure Orchestrator are categorically different from typical SaaS program management. I'm requesting a base salary of $215,000 to reflect this payments-critical delivery premium."

**Lever 2 — Mastercard Partnership Program Coordination:** "The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership is the most complex cross-functional program at Marqeta. It requires coordinating engineering, product, compliance, legal, and business development across two large organizations with different operating cadences. I bring experience in [large-scale partner integrations / enterprise program management / payments delivery] that directly accelerates the partnership's execution. I'd like my RSU grant at $180,000 over four years to align my upside with the partnership's delivery milestones."

**Lever 3 — Water Economy Delivery Orchestration:** "Marqeta's Water Economy vision requires coordinating platform deliveries that span real-time transaction processing, API design, compliance frameworks, and customer migrations — simultaneously. The delivery orchestration complexity of making finance flow like water through every application is far more demanding than typical platform program management. I'm asking for total comp at the 70th percentile — $425,000 — to reflect the multi-dimensional coordination this work requires."

**Lever 4 — Complexity Curve Program Expansion:** "As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, each new capability — embedded lending, multi-currency, programmable controls — is a new program that must be coordinated across engineering, compliance, and customer teams. The program surface area is expanding faster than headcount. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $30,000-$45,000 and a performance bonus target of 18% to reflect the direct impact of program delivery on Marqeta's revenue growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $215,000 base for Oakland/NYC and push for $180,000 in RSU grants (4-year vest). Lead with the Infrastructure Orchestrator framing: "I'm orchestrating the delivery of payments-critical platform programs that directly impact billions in transaction volume and $600M+ in revenue." Reference the Mastercard partnership as the most complex program at Marqeta and position your experience as de-risking that delivery. If they counter below $195,000 base, negotiate for a $35,000 sign-on bonus and a performance bonus target of 18-20%. Your accept-at floor should be $185,000 base + $150,000 RSU for Oakland/NYC, or $170,000 base + $125,000 RSU for Remote. Frame every counter around the Embedded 2.0 delivery premium: payments infrastructure programs carry regulatory, financial, and customer-trust stakes that demand premium TPM talent.
