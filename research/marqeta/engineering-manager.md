**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Marqeta lead the teams that build and operate the modern card issuing platform powering the embedded finance ecosystem. You are not managing a typical SaaS product team — you are leading engineers who build payments-critical infrastructure that processes real money in real time for Block (Cash App), DoorDash, Affirm, and Uber. The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership has expanded the scope and urgency of every engineering team at Marqeta, and as an Engineering Manager, you are responsible for hiring, retaining, and developing the Infrastructure Orchestrator talent that makes this partnership deliver. Your team's velocity and reliability directly impact whether Marqeta can execute on the Embedded 2.0 vision.

The "Water Economy" demands engineering leaders who can balance platform velocity with payments-grade reliability. Your team ships the APIs through which finance flows, and any incident on your watch has immediate revenue and trust implications for Marqeta's largest customers. You are managing the complexity curve — ensuring your engineers can navigate the intersection of distributed systems, financial regulation, and developer experience. With $600M+ in revenue depending on the systems your team owns, and a talent market where payments infrastructure engineers are among the scarcest hires in tech, your role as an Engineering Manager at Marqeta carries outsized organizational impact. Your compensation must reflect that you are a people leader at a publicly-traded Infrastructure Orchestrator, accountable for both technical outcomes and team health in one of the most demanding engineering environments in fintech.

### Embedded 2.0 — The Infrastructure Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Payments-Critical Team Leadership:** "As an Engineering Manager at Marqeta, I'm leading a team that owns systems processing real money for 100M+ end users through Cash App, DoorDash, and Uber. The operational stakes of managing a payments infrastructure team are categorically different from managing a typical product engineering team. Incident response, regulatory compliance, and zero-downtime deployments are table stakes. I'm requesting a base salary of $260,000 to reflect the Infrastructure Orchestrator management premium."

**Lever 2 — Mastercard Partnership Talent Strategy:** "The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership is scaling Marqeta's engineering surface area significantly. As an Engineering Manager, I'm directly responsible for hiring and developing the engineers who will build the Embedded 2.0 integration layer. My ability to attract and retain top payments infrastructure talent is a strategic asset. I'd like my RSU package at $280,000 over four years, reflecting both the talent strategy value and the equity upside from the Mastercard partnership."

**Lever 3 — Water Economy Operational Excellence:** "Marqeta's Water Economy vision — finance flowing through every application — means my team operates infrastructure that must be as reliable as water utilities. The operational excellence required to maintain five-nines availability on money movement systems, while simultaneously shipping new capabilities at startup velocity, is an extraordinarily demanding management challenge. I'm asking for total comp at the 70th percentile to reflect this dual mandate."

**Lever 4 — Complexity Curve Team Building:** "As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, my team needs to grow in both size and sophistication. I bring experience building and scaling engineering teams in [payments / infrastructure / fintech] environments, which directly accelerates Marqeta's ability to execute on its technical roadmap. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $40,000-$60,000 to offset the opportunity cost, and a guaranteed annual RSU refresh commitment to ensure long-term alignment with the complexity curve trajectory."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $255,000 base for Oakland/NYC and push for $280,000 in RSU grants (4-year vest). Engineering Managers at Marqeta should benchmark against Stripe and Block EM compensation, not generic SaaS companies. Lead with the Infrastructure Orchestrator premium: "I'm managing teams that own payments-critical systems for the largest consumer fintech platforms in the world." Push for a guaranteed annual refresh of $50,000-$70,000 in RSU by citing talent retention value. If they counter below $230,000 base, negotiate for a $50,000 sign-on bonus and a 15% management bonus target. Your accept-at floor should be $225,000 base + $220,000 RSU for Oakland/NYC, or $210,000 base + $190,000 RSU for Remote. Frame every counter around the Embedded 2.0 management premium: the best payments infrastructure engineers in the world need the best engineering managers, and that talent commands a premium.
