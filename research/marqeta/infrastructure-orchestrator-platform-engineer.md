**Negotiation DNA**

The Infrastructure Orchestrator Platform Engineer is the signature role at Marqeta — the role that most purely embodies the company's strategic identity and technical mission. This is not a standard platform engineering position. You are building the orchestration layer that transforms Marqeta from a modern card issuing platform into the definitive infrastructure through which embedded finance flows across the global economy. The term "Infrastructure Orchestrator" is not a marketing label — it is a precise description of what you build: the systems that orchestrate the creation, authorization, funding, and settlement of financial instruments in real time, across hundreds of customer applications, at planetary scale. When Block (Cash App) issues a virtual card, when DoorDash funds a Dasher payment, when Affirm creates a buy-now-pay-later instrument, and when Uber pays a driver in a new market — your platform orchestration layer is what makes it happen.

The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership has elevated this role from critical to existential. The partnership is a bet that Marqeta's orchestration layer can become the standard infrastructure for embedded card issuing across the entire Mastercard network. That means your platform must handle not just fintech-native customers like Cash App and DoorDash, but traditional financial institutions, global enterprises, and new market entrants — all with different compliance requirements, integration patterns, and performance expectations. You are building the platform that makes finance flow like water through every application — the "Water Economy" thesis made architecturally real. This is the most technically demanding, strategically important, and commercially impactful engineering role at Marqeta, and your compensation must reflect that.

The Embedded 2.0 vision depends entirely on the orchestration platform you build. Embedded 1.0 was about giving companies APIs to issue cards. Embedded 2.0 is about giving companies the ability to create, configure, and manage sophisticated financial products through a single programmable infrastructure layer. Just-in-time funding was the first orchestration primitive — funding a card at the exact moment of authorization. But the orchestration layer you are building extends far beyond that: programmable spend controls, real-time compliance enforcement, multi-currency settlement routing, embedded lending origination, dynamic risk scoring, and tokenization lifecycle management. Each of these capabilities requires platform primitives that are composable, reliable, and performant at financial-grade standards. You are moving finance up the complexity curve, one orchestration primitive at a time, and every primitive you ship becomes a new revenue line for Marqeta.

With $600M+ in revenue and a customer base that includes some of the largest consumer applications on earth, the Infrastructure Orchestrator Platform Engineer operates at the intersection of every technical, business, and regulatory challenge Marqeta faces. Your platform decisions determine API design for hundreds of external engineering teams. Your reliability choices determine whether transactions worth billions succeed or fail. Your architectural choices determine whether Marqeta can add new financial product types without rebuilding its core. This is the role where engineering, strategy, and financial infrastructure converge — and the compensation must reflect that convergence.

### Embedded 2.0 — The Infrastructure Orchestrator Premium

This section provides eight negotiation levers — double the standard guide — reflecting the signature importance of this role to Marqeta's strategic identity and Embedded 2.0 vision.

**Lever 1 — Core Platform Identity Alignment:** "The Infrastructure Orchestrator Platform Engineer is not just a role at Marqeta — it is the role that defines what Marqeta is. When Marqeta describes itself as an Infrastructure Orchestrator that moves finance up the complexity curve, it is describing the platform I build. My work is not a contribution to Marqeta's strategy — it is Marqeta's strategy, implemented in code. That identity-level alignment between my role and the company's strategic positioning warrants a base salary at the top of the range — $280,000 for Oakland/NYC — because there is no more strategically coupled engineering role at the company."

**Lever 2 — Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership Platform Enablement:** "The Mastercard partnership is the largest commercial bet in Marqeta's history, and the orchestration platform I build is what makes the partnership technically viable. Mastercard chose Marqeta because of the platform's ability to orchestrate card issuing, funding, and authorization through programmable APIs at network scale. As the partnership scales to serve traditional financial institutions alongside fintech-native customers, the platform must support fundamentally different integration patterns, compliance frameworks, and performance profiles — simultaneously. I am building the infrastructure that makes this possible. I'd like my RSU grant at $350,000 over four years, reflecting that my platform work directly enables the revenue growth the Mastercard partnership is designed to produce."

**Lever 3 — Water Economy Architecture Ownership:** "Marqeta's thesis that finance flows like water through every application is an architectural claim about the platform I build. Water infrastructure has specific properties — reliability, universality, invisibility, and adaptability. The orchestration platform must embody all of these: it must be reliable enough that money movement never fails, universal enough that any application can connect, invisible enough that developers don't need payments expertise, and adaptable enough to support financial products that haven't been invented yet. I am the architect of the Water Economy's infrastructure, and I'm asking for total comp at the 80th percentile — $680,000 — to reflect the architectural ownership this role demands."

**Lever 4 — Just-in-Time Funding Platform Evolution:** "Just-in-time funding is Marqeta's foundational innovation — the idea that a card can be funded at the exact moment of authorization, enabling entirely new financial products. But just-in-time funding is not a feature; it is a platform primitive that I extend and evolve. The next generation of just-in-time capabilities — conditional funding, multi-source funding, predictive pre-funding, and programmable funding rules — all require platform orchestration primitives that I design and build. Each primitive creates a new product capability for Marqeta's customers. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $50,000-$75,000 to reflect the immediate value I bring in evolving this core platform capability."

**Lever 5 — Complexity Curve Platform Primitives:** "Moving finance up the complexity curve means building platform primitives that let customers go from basic card issuing to sophisticated embedded financial products — lending, insurance, rewards, multi-currency, compliance automation — all through Marqeta's orchestration layer. Each step up the curve requires new platform abstractions that are composable, reliable, and performant. I am the engineer who builds these abstractions. The complexity curve is Marqeta's revenue growth curve, and every primitive I ship is a new revenue line. I'm requesting a guaranteed annual RSU refresh of $70,000-$90,000 to align my long-term compensation with the platform's long-term revenue expansion."

**Lever 6 — Multi-Customer Platform Scalability:** "The orchestration platform I build must simultaneously serve Cash App's 50M+ users, DoorDash's real-time driver payments, Affirm's lending instruments, Uber's global payment flows, and every new customer the Mastercard partnership brings. Each customer has different performance profiles, compliance requirements, and integration patterns. Building a platform that serves all of them without creating customer-specific complexity is one of the hardest platform engineering challenges in fintech. This multi-tenant financial infrastructure skill set is extraordinarily rare, and I'm requesting a performance bonus target of 20% to reflect the platform's direct revenue impact."

**Lever 7 — Embedded Finance API Platform Design:** "The developer experience of Marqeta's APIs is the company's competitive moat. As an Infrastructure Orchestrator Platform Engineer, I design the API abstractions that hundreds of external engineering teams build on for years. A poorly designed API becomes technical debt for Marqeta and every customer simultaneously. A well-designed API becomes a platform standard that locks in years of transaction volume. The leverage of API platform design at Marqeta's scale — where a single endpoint serves billions in volume — is extraordinary. I'm requesting that my total compensation reflect this leverage: $700,000+ for senior/staff level, with equity weighted to reflect the long-term platform value creation."

**Lever 8 — Financial Infrastructure Reliability Standard:** "The orchestration platform I build operates under a reliability standard that exceeds five-nines for money movement operations. Every transaction that flows through the platform — authorization, funding, settlement, reconciliation — must complete correctly or fail safely with full auditability. This is not the reliability standard of a social media feed or a search engine; this is the reliability standard of financial infrastructure where errors are measured in lost money and regulatory violations. I bring experience in [distributed systems / financial infrastructure / real-time processing] that directly meets this standard. I'd like my base salary, equity, and bonus to collectively reflect that I am building financial infrastructure that must be as reliable as the banking system itself — because for Marqeta's customers, it is the banking system."

### Extended Negotiation Playbook — Signature Role Deep Dive

**Opening Positioning Statement:**

When entering negotiations for this role, begin with the following framing: "I understand that the Infrastructure Orchestrator Platform Engineer role represents the technical core of Marqeta's identity and strategy. I want to make sure my compensation reflects that alignment. Marqeta describes itself as an Infrastructure Orchestrator that moves finance up the complexity curve — and this role is the literal implementation of that description. I'm not negotiating for a standard platform engineering position; I'm negotiating for the role that builds what Marqeta sells."

**Counter-Offer Strategy:**

If you receive a competing offer from Stripe, Block, Adyen, or a major bank's fintech team, position it as follows: "I have a competing offer at [company] for [amount]. But I want to be transparent — what draws me to Marqeta is the Infrastructure Orchestrator vision. The opportunity to build the orchestration platform for the Embedded 2.0 era is more strategically compelling than [competitor's] offering. However, I need my compensation to reflect the strategic importance of this role. Can we bridge the gap to [target amount]?"

**Equity Acceleration Request:**

For senior and staff-level candidates, request the following equity structure: "Given the strategic importance of this role to the Mastercard partnership and the Embedded 2.0 roadmap, I'd like to discuss an accelerated vesting schedule. Specifically, I'm requesting a 1-year cliff with monthly vesting thereafter, and a front-loaded grant where 40% vests in year one and 20% in each subsequent year. The platform primitives I build in the first year will directly enable the partnership's technical integration, and front-loaded vesting aligns my compensation with the value I create."

**Long-Term Retention Framing:**

Position your long-term value as follows: "The orchestration platform is not a feature that ships and is done — it is the evolving foundation of Marqeta's entire product offering. The institutional knowledge I build about Marqeta's platform architecture, customer integration patterns, compliance framework, and the Mastercard partnership's technical requirements becomes more valuable every year. I'd like to ensure my compensation includes a committed annual refresh of $70,000-$90,000 in RSU to reflect this compounding value."

### Water Economy Platform Architecture — Technical Depth

The Infrastructure Orchestrator Platform Engineer must understand and articulate the technical architecture that makes the Water Economy thesis real:

**Transaction Orchestration Layer:** You build the core transaction processing pipeline that handles authorization, clearing, and settlement across multiple funding sources, card networks, and compliance jurisdictions. This layer must process transactions in single-digit milliseconds while enforcing programmable spend controls, just-in-time funding logic, and real-time risk scoring. The architectural challenge is making this pipeline extensible — every new financial product type (lending, insurance, rewards) must plug into the same orchestration layer without degrading performance or reliability.

**API Platform Layer:** You design and build the developer-facing APIs that hundreds of engineering teams at companies like Cash App, DoorDash, Affirm, and Uber depend on daily. API design at this scale is permanent architecture — once an endpoint is adopted by external teams, it must be maintained and evolved without breaking changes for years. The platform must support both simple use cases (issue a card, fund a transaction) and complex orchestrations (multi-step conditional funding with compliance checks and real-time risk scoring) through the same API surface.

**Infrastructure Orchestration Layer:** You build the systems that coordinate across Marqeta's internal services, external partners (Mastercard, banking partners, compliance providers), and customer infrastructure. This orchestration layer manages the lifecycle of every card, every transaction, and every financial instrument on the platform. It must handle graceful degradation, cross-datacenter consistency, and regulatory failover requirements that are unique to financial infrastructure.

**Compliance and Auditability Layer:** You build the platform primitives that ensure every transaction, every card lifecycle event, and every funding movement is fully auditable and compliant with PCI-DSS, banking regulations, and Mastercard network rules. This is not logging — this is financial-grade audit infrastructure that regulators, auditors, and customers depend on for fiduciary accountability.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** This is the signature role at Marqeta, and negotiation should reflect that. Anchor at $275,000 base for Oakland/NYC and push aggressively for $350,000+ in RSU grants (4-year vest). At the senior/staff level, target total comp of $650,000-$750,000 by combining base, equity, sign-on, and bonus. Lead every negotiation touchpoint with the Infrastructure Orchestrator identity: "This role is the literal implementation of what Marqeta describes itself as — the Infrastructure Orchestrator for the Embedded 2.0 era." Request front-loaded equity vesting (40/20/20/20) citing first-year platform delivery value for the Mastercard partnership. Push for a guaranteed annual RSU refresh of $70,000-$90,000 by framing platform engineering as compounding institutional value. If they counter below $255,000 base, negotiate for a $65,000 sign-on bonus and a 20% performance bonus target. Your accept-at floor should be $250,000 base + $300,000 RSU for Oakland/NYC, or $225,000 base + $250,000 RSU for Remote. For competing offers from Stripe or Block, position Marqeta's Infrastructure Orchestrator vision as the differentiator and request a 10-15% premium over the competing offer to "close the gap and commit fully to the Embedded 2.0 platform mission." Never accept a package below the 65th percentile of the comp range — this is the role that builds what Marqeta sells, and Marqeta knows it.

### Market Context — Infrastructure Orchestrator Talent Landscape

The Infrastructure Orchestrator Platform Engineer role sits at the intersection of three talent markets, all of which are experiencing acute scarcity in 2026:

1. **Payments Infrastructure Engineers:** Engineers who understand card network protocols, issuer-processor architecture, authorization flows, and settlement mechanics. This talent pool is small because most payments knowledge is locked inside legacy processors (FIS, Fiserv, Global Payments) and is not transferable to modern API-first platforms without significant reskilling.

2. **Platform Engineers at Scale:** Engineers who have built and operated developer-facing platforms that serve hundreds of external engineering teams. This requires API design expertise, backward compatibility discipline, multi-tenant architecture experience, and developer experience sensibility. The talent pool is concentrated at companies like Stripe, Twilio, AWS, and Snowflake.

3. **Financial-Grade Distributed Systems Engineers:** Engineers who can build distributed systems that meet the reliability, consistency, and auditability requirements of financial infrastructure. This is a subset of distributed systems engineers who also understand transactional guarantees, regulatory compliance, and financial data sovereignty requirements.

The intersection of all three is extraordinarily small. Marqeta is competing for this talent against Stripe, Block, Adyen, Plaid, and the large banks' internal fintech teams. The scarcity premium for this intersection talent is real and should be reflected in compensation.
