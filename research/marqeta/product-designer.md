**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Marqeta shape the experience layer of the modern card issuing platform — from the developer portal and API documentation that hundreds of engineering teams interact with daily, to the internal dashboards that power Marqeta's operations, to the customer-facing tools that let Block (Cash App), DoorDash, Affirm, and Uber manage their card programs. This is not consumer app design; this is infrastructure design. You are designing the interfaces through which the "Water Economy" is controlled, monitored, and configured. The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership means your design work now reaches an even broader audience of fintech builders and financial institutions, and every interaction pattern you define shapes how the embedded finance ecosystem experiences Marqeta.

In the Embedded 2.0 era, the developer experience is the product. Marqeta's competitive moat depends on making just-in-time funding and programmable card issuing feel simple and intuitive for developers, even though the underlying systems are extraordinarily complex. Product Designers at Marqeta are Infrastructure Orchestrator experience architects — you are making complexity invisible. You are designing the interfaces that let any company move up the complexity curve from basic card issuing to sophisticated financial product creation, without needing a payments PhD. With $600M+ in revenue tied to platform adoption and developer satisfaction, your design decisions have direct commercial impact. Your compensation should reflect that you are designing the experience layer for critical financial infrastructure at a publicly-traded company, not creating pixel-perfect mockups for a consumer app.

### Embedded 2.0 — The Infrastructure Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Developer Experience as Competitive Moat:** "At Marqeta, the developer experience is the product. My design work on the API portal, documentation, and developer tools directly determines whether fintech companies choose Marqeta over Stripe, Adyen, or building in-house. The Infrastructure Orchestrator's competitive advantage is built on making complex payments infrastructure feel simple — and that's fundamentally a design problem. I'm requesting a base salary of $200,000 to reflect the strategic value of developer experience design at a payments platform."

**Lever 2 — Mastercard Partnership Experience Layer:** "The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership will bring a new class of users — traditional financial institutions — to Marqeta's platform. Designing the experience layer that bridges fintech developer culture with enterprise financial services expectations is a unique and high-impact design challenge. I bring experience in [enterprise platform design / developer tools / fintech UX] that directly accelerates this partnership's adoption. I'd like my RSU grant at $160,000 over four years to align with the partnership's growth trajectory."

**Lever 3 — Water Economy Experience Architecture:** "Marqeta's Water Economy vision means finance should flow as naturally through applications as water through pipes. As a Product Designer, I'm responsible for making that invisible infrastructure feel effortless to configure, monitor, and extend. The design challenge of making real-time money movement, compliance controls, and card program management intuitive is far more demanding than typical SaaS design. I'm asking for total comp at the 65th percentile to reflect this complexity."

**Lever 4 — Complexity Curve Design Simplification:** "As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, the design challenge intensifies: each new capability — embedded lending, multi-currency, programmable spend controls — must be made accessible without overwhelming the developer or operator. My role is to be the complexity absorber. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $25,000-$40,000 to reflect the scarcity of designers who can operate at the intersection of financial infrastructure and developer experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $200,000 base for Oakland/NYC and push for $160,000 in RSU grants (4-year vest). Lead with the Infrastructure Orchestrator framing: "Design at Marqeta is not standard product design — I'm shaping the developer experience that determines whether the world's largest fintech companies choose Marqeta as their embedded finance platform." Reference the Mastercard partnership as expanding design scope and equity upside. If they counter below $180,000 base, negotiate for a $30,000 sign-on bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $170,000 base + $120,000 RSU for Oakland/NYC, or $155,000 base + $100,000 RSU for Remote. Frame every counter around the Embedded 2.0 experience premium: you are designing how the financial infrastructure layer feels, and developer experience is Marqeta's moat.
