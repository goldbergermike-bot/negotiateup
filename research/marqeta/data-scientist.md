**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Marqeta operate on one of the richest transaction datasets in fintech. Every swipe, tap, and online purchase processed through the modern card issuing platform generates data that reveals how money moves through the digital economy. You are the intelligence layer of the "Water Economy" — analyzing the flow patterns, identifying fraud signals, optimizing authorization rates, and building the models that make just-in-time funding smarter and more reliable. The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership gives Marqeta access to even broader payment network intelligence, and Data Scientists are the ones who transform that data into competitive advantage. Powering Block (Cash App), DoorDash, Affirm, and Uber means your models operate at a scale and diversity that few fintech data teams ever experience.

In the Embedded 2.0 era, data science at Marqeta is not about dashboards and reports — it is about building the intelligence that makes the Infrastructure Orchestrator smarter. Your models determine whether a transaction is authorized in milliseconds, whether a fraud pattern is detected before loss occurs, and whether Marqeta's pricing is optimized for both platform growth and profitability. With $600M+ in revenue, even marginal improvements in authorization rates, fraud detection, or customer churn prediction translate to millions of dollars in impact. You are moving finance up the complexity curve by adding intelligence to every layer of the platform. Your compensation should reflect that Data Scientists at Marqeta work on payments-critical models with immediate P&L impact — not experimental analytics that might never ship.

### Embedded 2.0 — The Infrastructure Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Payments-Critical Model Impact:** "Data science at Marqeta is not exploratory analytics — my models directly impact authorization rates, fraud prevention, and revenue optimization on billions of dollars in transaction volume. A 10 basis point improvement in authorization rates for Cash App or DoorDash translates to millions in recovered revenue. That direct P&L impact at an Infrastructure Orchestrator commands a base salary of $210,000, competitive with what Stripe and Block pay for payments-focused Data Scientists."

**Lever 2 — Mastercard Partnership Data Intelligence:** "The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership gives Marqeta access to network-level payment intelligence that no standalone issuer-processor has. As a Data Scientist, I'll be building models that leverage this unique data advantage to create products and insights that competitors cannot replicate. I'd like my RSU grant at $190,000 over four years to align my compensation with the data moat this partnership creates for Embedded 2.0."

**Lever 3 — Water Economy Flow Analytics:** "Understanding how finance flows like water through every application requires a new kind of data science — one that combines real-time transaction analysis, network graph modeling, and financial time-series intelligence. Marqeta's Water Economy vision means I'm building the analytical frameworks that reveal how money actually moves through the digital economy. This is rare, high-value data science work. I'm asking for total comp at the 70th percentile — $430,000 — to reflect this specialization premium."

**Lever 4 — Complexity Curve Intelligence Layer:** "As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, every new product capability needs a data intelligence layer — embedded lending needs credit risk models, programmable spend controls need anomaly detection, multi-currency needs FX optimization. I bring experience in [fraud modeling / transaction analytics / risk scoring] that directly enables Marqeta's expansion along the complexity curve. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $30,000-$45,000 to reflect the scarcity of Data Scientists with payments infrastructure experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $210,000 base for Oakland/NYC and push for $190,000 in RSU grants (4-year vest). Lead with the Infrastructure Orchestrator framing: "My models directly impact revenue and risk on a platform processing billions in volume for the largest consumer fintech apps." Reference the Mastercard partnership as creating a unique data advantage that makes your work more valuable. If they counter below $190,000 base, negotiate for a $35,000 sign-on bonus and a guaranteed first-year RSU refresh. Your accept-at floor should be $180,000 base + $150,000 RSU for Oakland/NYC, or $165,000 base + $130,000 RSU for Remote. Frame every counter around the Embedded 2.0 data premium: payments data science at Marqeta has direct P&L impact measured in millions, not the indirect influence typical of analytics roles.
