**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Marqeta are the technical bridge between the modern card issuing platform and the companies that build on it. When Block is designing Cash App's next card product, when DoorDash is rearchitecting Dasher payments, when Affirm is launching a new credit instrument, or when Uber is expanding into a new market — a Solutions Architect is the person who translates Marqeta's infrastructure capabilities into the customer's technical architecture. You are the human interface of the "Water Economy," showing customers exactly how to connect their applications to the financial plumbing that Marqeta provides. The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership has dramatically expanded the customer base that needs this technical guidance, bringing traditional financial institutions to a platform originally designed for fintech developers.

In the Embedded 2.0 era, Solutions Architects at Marqeta are Infrastructure Orchestrator consultants. You are not selling a product — you are designing the integration architecture through which money will flow for years. Every integration pattern you recommend, every API workflow you design, and every just-in-time funding configuration you propose directly impacts the customer's revenue and operational efficiency. With $600M+ in revenue, each enterprise customer relationship you architect represents millions in annual platform revenue. You are helping customers move finance up the complexity curve, from basic card issuing to sophisticated embedded financial products. Your compensation should reflect that Solutions Architects at Marqeta carry direct revenue accountability and require a rare combination of payments domain expertise, API platform knowledge, and customer-facing technical leadership.

### Embedded 2.0 — The Infrastructure Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Revenue-Attached Technical Relationships:** "As a Solutions Architect at Marqeta, I'm directly responsible for designing the integration architecture for enterprise customers, each representing millions in annual platform revenue. When I architect a just-in-time funding integration for a customer like Cash App or DoorDash, that technical design locks in years of transaction volume. This direct revenue attachment at an Infrastructure Orchestrator warrants a base salary of $220,000, competitive with what Stripe pays Solutions Architects working on comparable enterprise payments integrations."

**Lever 2 — Mastercard Partnership Customer Expansion:** "The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership is bringing a fundamentally new customer segment — traditional financial institutions — to Marqeta's platform. As a Solutions Architect, I'll be designing integration architectures that bridge fintech APIs with enterprise banking systems. I bring experience in [enterprise integration / payments architecture / financial services] that directly enables this customer expansion. I'd like my RSU grant at $190,000 over four years to align with the partnership's customer growth trajectory."

**Lever 3 — Water Economy Integration Design:** "Marqeta's Water Economy thesis means every customer integration I design must make financial infrastructure flow seamlessly into the customer's application. The integration architecture I propose determines whether finance feels like water or feels like friction. This requires deep understanding of both Marqeta's platform and the customer's technology stack. I'm asking for total comp at the 70th percentile — $450,000 — to reflect the architectural skill and customer relationship value this work demands."

**Lever 4 — Complexity Curve Customer Navigation:** "As Marqeta moves finance up the complexity curve, Solutions Architects become the guides who show customers what's possible. I'm not just implementing integrations — I'm showing customers how to evolve from basic card issuing to embedded lending, programmable spend controls, and multi-currency operations. Each step up the curve is a revenue expansion opportunity. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $30,000-$45,000 and a variable compensation component tied to customer adoption milestones."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $220,000 base for Oakland/NYC and push for $190,000 in RSU grants (4-year vest). Lead with the Infrastructure Orchestrator framing: "I'm designing the technical integration architecture through which millions in annual revenue flows for each enterprise customer." Reference the Mastercard partnership as expanding the customer base and increasing deal complexity. If they counter below $200,000 base, negotiate for a $35,000 sign-on bonus and a variable comp component tied to customer success metrics. Your accept-at floor should be $190,000 base + $150,000 RSU for Oakland/NYC, or $175,000 base + $130,000 RSU for Remote. Frame every counter around the Embedded 2.0 integration premium: Solutions Architects at Marqeta carry direct revenue accountability and require a uniquely scarce combination of payments expertise and enterprise architecture skill.
