**Negotiation DNA**

Marqeta occupies a singular position in the fintech infrastructure stack as the modern card issuing platform powering Block (Cash App), DoorDash, Affirm, and Uber. As a Software Engineer at Marqeta, you are building the literal plumbing through which billions of dollars flow — the "Water Economy" thesis made real. Every API endpoint you ship, every microservice you harden, every latency improvement you deliver directly enables the just-in-time funding architecture that differentiates Marqeta from legacy card processors. The Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership has elevated Marqeta from a pure-play issuer-processor to an Infrastructure Orchestrator, and your engineering work is what makes that orchestration possible at scale.

The Embedded 2.0 era means Marqeta is no longer just issuing cards — it is embedding programmable finance into every application on the planet. As a Software Engineer, you sit at the intersection of payments compliance, real-time transaction processing, and developer experience. Your code powers the APIs that let any company become a fintech company. With $600M+ in revenue and a platform that processes transactions for some of the largest consumer apps in the world, Marqeta offers Software Engineers the rare combination of mission-critical infrastructure work with the velocity of a growth-stage fintech. You are moving finance up the complexity curve, and your compensation should reflect the Infrastructure Orchestrator premium that Marqeta commands in the market.

### Embedded 2.0 — The Infrastructure Orchestrator Premium

**Lever 1 — Mission-Critical Payments Infrastructure:** "I want to highlight that Marqeta's platform processes billions in transaction volume for Cash App, DoorDash, Affirm, and Uber. As a Software Engineer building this infrastructure, I'm working on systems where downtime is measured in dollars-per-second. The reliability and precision required for just-in-time funding at this scale commands a premium over standard SaaS engineering roles. I'd like my base to reflect the Infrastructure Orchestrator complexity at $175,000."

**Lever 2 — Mastercard SaaS-Fintech Partnership Expansion:** "The Mastercard partnership positions Marqeta as the definitive embedded finance platform. As this partnership scales, every engineer becomes more valuable because the blast radius of our work expands exponentially. I'm not just building for Marqeta's current customers — I'm building the infrastructure layer for Mastercard's entire SaaS-Fintech distribution strategy. This warrants an additional $20,000-$30,000 in RSU grants to align my upside with the partnership trajectory."

**Lever 3 — Water Economy Platform Velocity:** "Marqeta's 'Water Economy' thesis — that finance flows like water through every application — means your engineering team needs to ship at platform velocity while maintaining payments-grade reliability. That dual mandate is rare and valuable. I bring experience in [distributed systems / API design / real-time processing] that directly accelerates Marqeta's ability to be the water infrastructure for embedded finance. I'm asking for total comp at the 65th percentile to reflect this."

**Lever 4 — Complexity Curve Differentiation:** "Marqeta is actively moving finance up the complexity curve — from simple card issuing to full-stack embedded financial infrastructure. As a Software Engineer, I'll be building the systems that enable this transition. The technical complexity of programmable money movement, tokenization, and real-time decisioning is fundamentally harder than typical application engineering. I'd like to see the bonus target set at 15% to recognize this complexity premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your ask at the 70th percentile of the comp range — $175,000 base in Oakland/NYC. Lead with the Infrastructure Orchestrator framing: you are not a generic SaaS engineer, you are building the financial plumbing for the Embedded 2.0 era. Push for a $120,000 RSU package (4-year vest) by citing the Mastercard partnership as a stock catalyst. If they counter below $160,000 base, request a sign-on bonus of $20,000-$30,000 to bridge the gap. Your accept-at floor should be $155,000 base + $90,000 RSU for Oakland/NYC, or $140,000 base + $80,000 RSU for Remote. Always frame your ask around the complexity premium: "Marqeta engineers build payments infrastructure that powers $200B+ in annualized volume — that's Infrastructure Orchestrator work, not standard application development."
