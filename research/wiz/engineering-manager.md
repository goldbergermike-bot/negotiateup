### Engineering Manager — Wiz (Google) Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: As an Engineering Manager at the $32B Hyperscaler Multicloud security leader, you lead the engineering teams delivering Google Cloud's most strategically critical security integration.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | New York (USD) | Tel Aviv (ILS ₪) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $175,000–$215,000 | ₪480,000–₪620,000 | £85,000–£105,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $235,000–$320,000 | ₪630,000–₪920,000 | £115,000–£155,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $295,000–$420,000 | ₪780,000–₪1,200,000 | £140,000–£200,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, Alphabet RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: GOOGL), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

Engineering Managers at Wiz lead the teams building the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud security platform that Google acquired for $32B. The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval finalized the deal, and now Engineering Managers are responsible for the most complex challenge in the integration: retaining world-class engineering talent while shipping at startup velocity inside a large enterprise.

Post-acquisition engineering management is uniquely demanding. You must navigate Google's engineering culture (L3-L8 leveling, OKRs, promotion committees) while preserving Wiz's Multicloud innovation speed. Engineering Managers who can bridge these two cultures — maintaining the startup energy that built a $32B company while adopting Alphabet's processes — are exceptionally valuable and difficult to replace.

Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, Engineering Managers receive RSU grants and management bonuses that reflect both team size and strategic impact. Post-acquisition retention packages for engineering leaders typically include supplemental RSU grants. You should negotiate for these explicitly — Google's biggest risk is losing the managers who hold teams together during integration.

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As an Engineering Manager, you negotiate as the leader of the teams that built the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud platform under the Alphabet equity umbrella. Your retention is not optional — it is existential to the deal's success.

Engineering Managers at Wiz are responsible for teams of 8-15 engineers building Multicloud security products that span every major Hyperscaler. Losing a manager during the post-acquisition transition doesn't just mean losing one person — it risks destabilizing an entire team. Google understands this calculus, which is why EM retention packages post-acquisition are among the most generous.

When negotiating, frame your value explicitly: "The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. I negotiate as a Hyperscaler-led Multicloud engineering leader under the Alphabet equity umbrella. My team's continuity is critical to the integration timeline. I expect compensation that reflects the strategic risk of engineering leadership attrition."

The $32B mega-deal valuation was built on the output of the teams you manage. Google Cloud cannot replicate this Multicloud capability without the engineering organization that created it. Your negotiation leverage is the team itself — and the risk that losing you cascades into losing the team.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

Engineering Managers who lead CSPM teams own the delivery of Wiz's core product — the agentless scanning platform that protects Multicloud workloads. Negotiate: "I lead the CSPM engineering team that delivers the core product behind the $32B valuation. My team's output is directly tied to ARR growth. Losing me risks the team — and the product timeline."

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

Post-acquisition, Engineering Managers drive the integration between Wiz's platform and GCP security services. This requires navigating both organizations, managing cross-functional dependencies, and delivering on a timeline that Google Cloud leadership is watching closely. Say: "I manage the Google Cloud integration workstream — the most visible post-acquisition deliverable. My ability to ship this integration across Hyperscaler environments is worth a premium above standard EM compensation."

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

Engineering Managers leading CDR teams are building Wiz's next growth vector — real-time runtime protection across Hyperscaler environments. Negotiate: "I lead the CDR engineering team building runtime protection — Wiz's most important new product line. This is the growth story that justifies the $32B valuation beyond current ARR."

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With the February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, Engineering Managers receive Alphabet RSU grants with management-level allocations. Push for supplemental retention grants: "Post-acquisition EM attrition creates cascading team risk. I expect an RSU package that includes standard L5/L6 EM allocation plus a retention-specific supplement under the Alphabet equity umbrella. My retention is a team-level retention strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $250,000 base with 1,400 Alphabet RSUs ($266,000 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $470,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise.
