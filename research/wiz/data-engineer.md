### Data Engineer — Wiz (Google) Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: As a Data Engineer at the $32B Hyperscaler Multicloud security leader, you build the data pipelines and infrastructure that process billions of cloud resources across every major Hyperscaler — the data backbone of Google Cloud's most strategic acquisition.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | New York (USD) | Tel Aviv (ILS ₪) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $165,000–$205,000 | ₪450,000–₪600,000 | £80,000–£100,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $220,000–$305,000 | ₪590,000–₪880,000 | £107,000–£148,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $275,000–$400,000 | ₪740,000–₪1,150,000 | £132,000–£192,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, Alphabet RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: GOOGL), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

Data Engineers at Wiz build the data infrastructure that powers the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud Security Graph — the proprietary technology that Google acquired for $32B. The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval opened the door to leveraging Google Cloud's data infrastructure (BigQuery, Dataflow, Pub/Sub) at scale, and Data Engineers are at the center of this integration.

Wiz's platform ingests, processes, and correlates cloud configuration data, runtime telemetry, vulnerability intelligence, and identity information from every major Hyperscaler — AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI. The data engineering challenge is extraordinary: petabyte-scale data from heterogeneous sources must be unified into a consistent Multicloud graph that supports real-time querying and analysis. Data Engineers who can build at this scale across Hyperscaler boundaries are exceptionally rare.

Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, Data Engineers receive RSU grants on GOOGL stock. Post-acquisition, Wiz Data Engineers gain access to Google's best-in-class data infrastructure — BigQuery, Spanner, Bigtable, Dataflow — creating an unprecedented opportunity to scale Wiz's data architecture. Your compensation should reflect both the existing Multicloud expertise and the expanded Google Cloud data engineering scope.

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As a Data Engineer, you negotiate as the architect of the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud data infrastructure under the Alphabet equity umbrella. Your pipelines process the data that makes the $32B platform work.

Wiz's Multicloud Security Graph is fundamentally a data engineering achievement. It takes unstructured cloud API data from every major Hyperscaler and transforms it into a unified, queryable graph that maps relationships between cloud resources, identities, vulnerabilities, and configurations. Data Engineers who built and maintain this infrastructure hold deep institutional knowledge that cannot be transferred through documentation.

Frame your negotiation: "The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. I negotiate as a Hyperscaler-led Multicloud data engineer under the Alphabet equity umbrella. I build the data pipelines that power the Security Graph — the core technology Google paid $32B to acquire. My data engineering expertise is the foundation of the platform."

Post-acquisition, Data Engineers lead the integration of Wiz's data infrastructure with Google Cloud's data stack. This includes evaluating migration to BigQuery, integrating with Dataflow for streaming processing, and leveraging Spanner for globally distributed data. Data Engineers who can architect this integration are critical to the acquisition's technical success.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

Data Engineers who build CSPM data pipelines process billions of cloud resource snapshots from Multicloud environments. Your pipelines determine scan coverage, freshness, and accuracy. Negotiate: "I build the CSPM data pipelines — the data infrastructure that powers the core product behind the $32B valuation. My pipelines process billions of cloud resources across every Hyperscaler every day."

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

Post-acquisition, Data Engineers architect the integration between Wiz's data infrastructure and GCP data services. This is the most technically complex data engineering challenge in the integration. Say: "I architect the data infrastructure integration with Google Cloud — connecting Wiz's Multicloud data pipelines with BigQuery, Dataflow, and Spanner. This is the data engineering backbone of the $32B acquisition."

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

CDR data engineering requires real-time streaming pipelines that process security events from Hyperscaler environments with sub-second latency. Negotiate: "I build the CDR data pipelines — real-time streaming infrastructure that processes security events across Multicloud environments. This is the most technically demanding data engineering challenge in cloud security."

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With the February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, Data Engineers receive Alphabet RSU grants with access to Google's data infrastructure. Say: "Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, I expect RSU grants that reflect my Multicloud data engineering expertise and the expanded scope of working with Google-scale data infrastructure. The $32B platform's data layer is my work — and my retention is critical to data infrastructure continuity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $225,000 base with 1,100 Alphabet RSUs ($209,000 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $385,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise.
