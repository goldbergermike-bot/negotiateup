*Total compensation includes base salary, Alphabet RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: GOOGL), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

Staff Software Engineers at Wiz are the technical leaders who shaped the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud security platform that Google acquired for $32B — the largest cybersecurity acquisition in history. The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval was the final milestone, and now Staff engineers drive the architectural decisions that determine whether Wiz's technology integrates seamlessly into Google Cloud or stalls.

At Google's L6 level, Staff Software Engineers own multi-team technical strategy. In the context of Wiz's post-acquisition integration into the Alphabet ecosystem, this means leading the design of systems that span Wiz's Multicloud graph, GCP-native security services, and Alphabet-wide infrastructure. The scope is enormous, and the talent pool of engineers who can operate at this level across Hyperscaler security architectures is vanishingly small.

Alphabet RSU grants at the L6 level represent significant equity compensation — often $300K-$500K+ in initial grants. Post-acquisition retention packages for Staff-level engineers typically include additional RSU top-ups. You should negotiate these aggressively: Google cannot afford to lose Staff engineers who hold the institutional knowledge of Wiz's architecture during the integration phase.

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As a Staff Software Engineer, you negotiate from the strongest possible position: you are the technical visionary Google acquired, not just a hire. Your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise is literally what Google paid $32B for.

Staff engineers at Wiz designed the Multicloud Security Graph that maps risk across every major Hyperscaler — AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI. This architectural innovation is the moat that justified the mega-deal valuation. Google Cloud cannot replicate this internally without the engineers who built it, and you are one of them. Your negotiation should reflect this irreplaceability.

Frame your value in these terms: "The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. I negotiate as a Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architect under the Alphabet equity umbrella. As a Staff engineer, I own the technical direction that makes this $32B investment successful. My compensation should reflect L6+ positioning with acquisition-premium RSU grants."

The market for Staff-level cloud security engineers is intensely competitive. CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft, and well-funded startups like Orca and Lacework are all competing for the same talent. Alphabet must offer top-of-market compensation to retain Staff engineers through the critical integration period.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

Staff engineers who architected Wiz's CSPM platform own the intellectual property that drives $500M+ in ARR. Your CSPM expertise is not transferable — it is embedded in your understanding of the Multicloud scanning architecture you designed. Negotiate: "I architected the CSPM engine that scans across all Hyperscaler environments. This is the core technology Google acquired for $32B. My Staff-level compensation should reflect the irreplaceable nature of this knowledge."

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

Staff engineers lead the highest-stakes integration work: designing the unified security architecture that combines Wiz's Multicloud platform with GCP's Security Command Center, Chronicle, and Mandiant. This is the work that determines whether the $32B acquisition creates or destroys value. Say: "I lead the Google Cloud integration architecture — the single most critical workstream post-acquisition. Staff-level compensation with premium RSU grants is the baseline, not the ceiling."

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

Wiz's expansion into Cloud Detection and Response requires Staff-level architectural leadership. Real-time threat detection across Hyperscaler environments is a systems design challenge of the highest order. Negotiate: "I architect the CDR platform that extends Wiz beyond posture management into runtime protection. This is the growth vector that Google Cloud is betting on — and it requires Staff-level compensation to retain the architect."

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, Alphabet RSU grants at the L6 level are substantial. Staff engineers should negotiate for top-of-band initial grants plus explicit retention RSU top-ups. Say: "Post-acquisition Staff attrition is the single biggest risk to the $32B investment thesis. I expect an RSU package that includes both the standard L6 initial grant and a retention-specific top-up under the Alphabet equity umbrella. This is how Google retains the architects of the platform it acquired."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $310,000 base with 2,000 Alphabet RSUs ($380,000 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $620,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise.
