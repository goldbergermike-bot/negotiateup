*Total compensation includes base salary, Alphabet RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: GOOGL), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

Data Scientists at Wiz work on one of the most unique datasets in cybersecurity — a Multicloud Security Graph that maps relationships across billions of cloud resources spanning every major Hyperscaler. Google acquired this capability for $32B, and the February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval means the full power of Alphabet's data infrastructure is now available to Wiz Data Scientists.

The Hyperscaler-led Multicloud data challenge is unprecedented. Wiz processes cloud configuration data, runtime telemetry, identity graphs, and vulnerability intelligence across AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI simultaneously. Data Scientists who can build models on this cross-Hyperscaler dataset are in exceptional demand. Google's own threat intelligence teams (Mandiant, VirusTotal) produce complementary data, creating an analytics opportunity that no other company can match.

Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, Data Scientists receive RSU grants on GOOGL stock. With access to Google's AI/ML infrastructure (TPUs, Vertex AI, BigQuery), Wiz Data Scientists now operate at a scale that was impossible pre-acquisition. Your compensation should reflect this expanded scope and the strategic value of Multicloud security analytics.

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As a Data Scientist, you negotiate as the analytics architect mining the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud Security Graph under the Alphabet equity umbrella. Your models power the intelligence that justifies the $32B valuation.

Wiz's Multicloud Security Graph is a proprietary dataset that connects cloud resources, identities, vulnerabilities, and configurations across every major Hyperscaler. Data Scientists who build analytics on this graph — identifying attack paths, predicting misconfiguration risk, and correlating threats across cloud providers — are building intellectual property that Google acquired for $32B. This is not standard data science work; it is the creation of a Multicloud security intelligence engine.

Frame your negotiation: "The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. I negotiate as a Hyperscaler-led Multicloud data scientist under the Alphabet equity umbrella. My analytics and ML models are the intelligence layer that makes Wiz's platform actionable. The $32B valuation depends on the data-driven insights I build."

Post-acquisition, Data Scientists at Wiz can leverage Google's AI infrastructure — BigQuery for petabyte-scale analysis, Vertex AI for model deployment, and TPU access for training. This transforms the scope of what's possible, and Data Scientists who can capitalize on this infrastructure are uniquely valuable.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

Data Scientists who build risk models for CSPM directly impact product quality and customer outcomes. Your models prioritize the most critical misconfigurations across Multicloud environments. Negotiate: "I build the risk scoring models that power Wiz's CSPM platform — the analytical backbone of the core product that drives $500M+ ARR. My models directly improve security outcomes across Hyperscaler environments."

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

Post-acquisition, Data Scientists integrate Wiz's analytics with Google Cloud's data infrastructure. This includes connecting Wiz's Multicloud graph with Chronicle SIEM, Mandiant threat intelligence, and BigQuery analytics. Say: "I build the analytics integration between Wiz's Multicloud Security Graph and Google Cloud's data platform. This is the data science work that multiplies the value of the $32B acquisition."

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

CDR requires real-time anomaly detection across Hyperscaler environments — a data science challenge that combines streaming analytics with security domain expertise. Negotiate: "I build the real-time threat detection models for CDR — identifying anomalies across Multicloud runtime environments. This is the most technically demanding data science work in cloud security."

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With the February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, Data Scientists receive Alphabet RSU grants with access to Google's AI infrastructure. This is a unique combination. Say: "Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, I expect RSU grants that reflect the intersection of Multicloud security domain expertise and advanced data science. The $32B deal gives me Google-scale infrastructure — my compensation should match Google-scale impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $225,000 base with 1,100 Alphabet RSUs ($209,000 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $390,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise.
