*Total compensation includes base salary, Alphabet RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: GOOGL), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

Technical Program Managers at Wiz drive the execution of programs that span the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud security platform Google acquired for $32B. The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval triggered the most complex integration program in Google Cloud's history, and TPMs are the leaders who ensure it executes on time and within scope.

Post-acquisition program management is uniquely challenging. TPMs must coordinate across Wiz engineering, Google Cloud engineering, product management, security, legal, and compliance — navigating two organizational cultures, two engineering processes, and one extremely tight integration timeline. The Multicloud architecture adds additional complexity: programs must account for AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI workstreams simultaneously.

Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, TPMs receive RSU grants on GOOGL stock. Google famously values TPMs highly — they are the execution backbone of every major initiative. Wiz TPMs who can drive post-acquisition integration programs command a premium over standard Google TPM compensation because they combine cross-functional program leadership with Multicloud security domain expertise.

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As a Technical Program Manager, you negotiate as the execution leader orchestrating Hyperscaler-led Multicloud programs under the Alphabet equity umbrella. Your program leadership is the difference between a successful $32B integration and a failed one.

TPMs at Wiz manage programs that touch every major Hyperscaler — coordinating engineering work across cloud providers, managing dependencies between Wiz and Google Cloud teams, and ensuring that the Multicloud security platform ships on schedule. This cross-Hyperscaler program complexity is orders of magnitude beyond standard TPM scope.

Frame your negotiation: "The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. I negotiate as the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud program execution leader under the Alphabet equity umbrella. I drive the integration programs that determine whether the $32B deal creates value. My program leadership is the execution engine behind the acquisition thesis."

The post-acquisition integration timeline is aggressive. Google Cloud wants to show Wiz integration milestones quickly to validate the $32B investment. TPMs who can drive this timeline — managing scope, resources, and cross-organizational dependencies — are critical to demonstrating acquisition success to Alphabet leadership and investors.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

TPMs who manage CSPM programs coordinate the largest product workstream at Wiz — the core scanning platform that operates across Multicloud environments. Negotiate: "I manage the CSPM program — the largest and most complex workstream at Wiz. My program drives the core product that powers $500M+ ARR across Hyperscaler environments. The $32B valuation depends on this program's execution."

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

Post-acquisition, TPMs drive the integration program between Wiz and GCP. This is the most high-profile program in Google Cloud, with visibility to SVP and C-level leadership. Say: "I manage the Google Cloud integration program — the most visible post-acquisition workstream. This program spans Wiz engineering, GCP engineering, product, legal, and compliance. My execution drives the timeline that Alphabet leadership is watching."

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

TPMs managing CDR programs coordinate the build-out of Wiz's newest product capabilities. Runtime protection requires real-time systems across Hyperscaler environments — a program management challenge that combines technical complexity with aggressive timelines. Negotiate: "I manage the CDR program — Wiz's most important new product line. This program requires coordinating real-time systems engineering across Multicloud environments. My program leadership opens the next growth chapter."

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With the February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, TPMs receive Alphabet RSU grants. Program leadership continuity is critical during acquisitions — losing a TPM mid-program creates weeks of ramp-up time for a replacement. Say: "Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, I expect RSU grants that reflect the criticality of program continuity. The $32B integration is the highest-priority program at Google Cloud — my retention ensures execution continuity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $225,000 base with 1,050 Alphabet RSUs ($199,500 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $380,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise.
