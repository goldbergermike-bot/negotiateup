#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

Product Designers at Wiz design the user experience for the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud security platform that Google acquired for $32B. The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval unlocked full Google Cloud integration, and now designers are tasked with creating a unified security UX that works across every Hyperscaler while fitting seamlessly into Google Cloud Console.

Security product design is exceptionally challenging. You must make complex Multicloud risk data — spanning AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI — comprehensible to security teams, DevOps engineers, and executive stakeholders. Wiz's product-led growth strategy depends on designers who can transform overwhelming cloud security data into actionable, intuitive experiences. This is the design challenge that justifies a premium over standard UX roles.

Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, Product Designers receive RSU grants on GOOGL stock. Google's design compensation is already top-tier, and Wiz designers command an additional premium because the product experience is the primary differentiator in the cloud security market. Your design decisions directly drive adoption and retention.

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As a Product Designer, you negotiate as the UX architect defining how enterprises experience Hyperscaler-led Multicloud security under the Alphabet equity umbrella.

Wiz's competitive advantage is partly a design advantage. The platform's ability to visualize complex Multicloud security posture — showing risk paths across Hyperscaler environments in a single pane of glass — is what drives enterprise adoption. Product Designers who craft these experiences are central to Wiz's product-led growth engine. Google acquired this UX innovation as part of the $32B deal, and replacing designers who understand the domain is extremely difficult.

Frame your negotiation: "The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. I negotiate as a Hyperscaler-led Multicloud UX designer under the Alphabet equity umbrella. My design work transforms complex Multicloud security data into the intuitive experience that drives Wiz's adoption and justifies the $32B valuation."

Post-acquisition, the design challenge intensifies. Designers must integrate Wiz's experience into Google Cloud Console, harmonize design systems across Google's Material Design and Wiz's existing patterns, and maintain the product simplicity that made Wiz successful. This requires designers with deep Multicloud security domain expertise — not standard Google UX transfers.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

Designers who own CSPM UX drive the experience of Wiz's core product. Your design decisions on risk visualization, compliance dashboards, and Multicloud posture views directly impact adoption metrics. Negotiate: "I design the CSPM user experience — the product interface that drives Wiz's $500M+ ARR. Enterprise customers adopt Wiz because of the design clarity I create across Hyperscaler environments."

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

Post-acquisition, designers lead the UX integration with Google Cloud Console and GCP security products. This requires harmonizing design languages while preserving Wiz's distinctive visual clarity. Say: "I design the Google Cloud integration experience — the most visible expression of the $32B acquisition to every GCP customer. This requires Multicloud design expertise that standard Google UX designers don't have."

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

CDR product design requires real-time security event visualization — a design challenge that combines data density with time-critical decision-making. Negotiate: "I design the CDR and runtime protection experience — real-time security UX across Hyperscaler environments. This is the most demanding design problem in cloud security."

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With the February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, Product Designers receive Alphabet RSU grants. Design talent with security domain expertise is rare, and Google must compete with companies that are aggressively recruiting security-focused designers. Say: "Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, I expect RSU grants that reflect the scarcity of designers with Multicloud security expertise. The $32B deal depends on maintaining the UX quality that differentiates Wiz."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $210,000 base with 900 Alphabet RSUs ($171,000 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $340,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise.
