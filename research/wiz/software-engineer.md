### Software Engineer — Wiz (Google) Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: As a Software Engineer joining the $32B Hyperscaler Multicloud security powerhouse, you build the foundational cloud security platform that anchors Google Cloud's most strategic acquisition.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | New York (USD) | Tel Aviv (ILS ₪) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $165,000–$205,000 | ₪450,000–₪600,000 | £80,000–£100,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $215,000–$295,000 | ₪585,000–₪870,000 | £104,000–£145,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $250,000–$370,000 | ₪675,000–₪1,080,000 | £120,000–£175,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, Alphabet RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: GOOGL), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

Software Engineers at Wiz occupy the engineering core of what became the largest cybersecurity acquisition in history when Google closed the $32B deal. The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval cemented Wiz as the crown jewel of Google Cloud's security portfolio, and every engineer building on the Wiz platform now operates under the Alphabet equity umbrella with access to Google-scale infrastructure.

The Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture that Wiz pioneered — spanning AWS, Azure, GCP, and Oracle Cloud — is the strategic moat that justified the $32B price tag. Software Engineers who can build and extend this Multicloud graph technology are in extraordinary demand as Google Cloud races to integrate Wiz capabilities across its entire security stack.

With Alphabet RSU grants replacing pre-acquisition equity, compensation now tracks GOOGL on NASDAQ. This creates a unique negotiation window: Google must retain Wiz engineering talent through competitive packages that reflect both startup-velocity impact and big-tech total compensation. Engineers who understand this dynamic can negotiate significantly above initial offers.

#### Wiz (Google) Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Software Engineer II | L4 | Software Engineer III |
| Senior Software Engineer | L5 | Senior Software Engineer |
| Staff Software Engineer | L6 | Staff Software Engineer |

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As a Software Engineer, you negotiate as a builder of the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud platform under the Alphabet equity umbrella. This is not a routine hire — it is Google's most expensive bet on cloud security, and your engineering output directly determines whether the $32B investment pays off.

Wiz's Multicloud Security Graph connects workloads across every major Hyperscaler — AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI — into a unified risk model. Software Engineers who extend this graph architecture are irreplaceable in the post-acquisition integration phase. Google Cloud cannot replicate this Multicloud capability internally; it acquired it for $32B precisely because building it from scratch would take years.

The negotiation leverage is clear: cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal valuation, and the fact that Alphabet is competing with CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Microsoft for the same Hyperscaler-native security engineering talent. Your Multicloud expertise commands a premium because it is the strategic differentiator that Google Cloud bought.

Every Software Engineer at Wiz now sits inside the Alphabet compensation framework. RSU grants vest over four years on GOOGL stock, and the retention imperative post-acquisition means Google will match or exceed competing offers to keep critical engineering talent. Use this to your advantage.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

Wiz invented agentless CSPM at scale, and Software Engineers who build and extend this capability are central to Google Cloud's security roadmap. When negotiating, emphasize your ability to ship CSPM features that protect workloads across Multicloud environments. Say: "My CSPM engineering work directly supports the $32B thesis — I build the agentless scanning that differentiates Wiz from every competitor."

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

Post-acquisition, the highest-priority engineering work involves deep GCP integration. Software Engineers who can bridge Wiz's Multicloud platform with Google Cloud's native security services (Security Command Center, Chronicle, BeyondCorp) command premium compensation. Frame your negotiation around this: "I accelerate the Google Cloud integration that justifies the $32B acquisition price."

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

Wiz's expansion into Cloud Detection and Response (CDR) and runtime protection represents the next growth vector. Software Engineers building real-time threat detection across Hyperscaler environments are in peak demand. Negotiate by saying: "My runtime protection expertise addresses the fastest-growing segment of cloud security — the capability Google Cloud needs most urgently post-acquisition."

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With the February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, Alphabet RSU grants are now the primary equity vehicle. Software Engineers should negotiate for above-standard RSU allocations by citing retention risk: "Post-acquisition transitions create attrition risk. A competitive RSU package — above the standard L4/L5 band — ensures I'm committed through the critical integration period. I'm building under the Alphabet equity umbrella and expect compensation that reflects Google-tier engineering impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $195,000 base with 800 Alphabet RSUs ($152,000 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $310,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise.
