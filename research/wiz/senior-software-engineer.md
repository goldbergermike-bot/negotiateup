### Senior Software Engineer — Wiz (Google) Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: As a Senior Software Engineer at the $32B Hyperscaler Multicloud security leader, you own critical system design decisions that shape Google Cloud's most strategic security platform.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | New York (USD) | Tel Aviv (ILS ₪) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $165,000–$205,000 | ₪450,000–₪600,000 | £80,000–£100,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $225,000–$310,000 | ₪600,000–₪900,000 | £110,000–£150,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $280,000–$400,000 | ₪750,000–₪1,150,000 | £135,000–£190,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, Alphabet RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: GOOGL), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

Senior Software Engineers at Wiz are the technical backbone of the platform that Google acquired for $32B — the largest cybersecurity deal in history. The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval removed the last regulatory barrier, and now Google Cloud is accelerating integration at full speed. Seniors own the architectural decisions that determine whether Wiz's Hyperscaler-led Multicloud platform scales inside the Alphabet ecosystem.

At the L5 level in Google's framework, Senior Software Engineers at Wiz are expected to lead subsystems, mentor junior engineers, and drive cross-team technical initiatives. The Multicloud Security Graph — which maps risk across AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI — requires senior engineers who can operate at the intersection of distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and security. This combination of skills is exceptionally rare, and Google knows it.

Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, Senior Engineers receive RSU grants that vest over four years on GOOGL stock. The post-acquisition retention imperative means that initial RSU offers are often negotiable upward by 20-40%. Google cannot afford attrition at the senior level during the critical integration phase — use this leverage aggressively.

#### Wiz (Google) Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Wiz Title | Google Level | Google Equivalent Title |

| Software Engineer I | L3 | Software Engineer II |
| Software Engineer II | L4 | Software Engineer III |
| Senior Software Engineer | L5 | Senior Software Engineer |
| Staff Software Engineer | L6 | Staff Software Engineer |
| Principal Software Engineer | L7 | Principal Engineer |

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As a Senior Software Engineer, you negotiate from a position of exceptional strength: you are the technical leader Google needs to integrate Wiz's Hyperscaler-led Multicloud platform into the broader Alphabet ecosystem.

The $32B price tag was justified by Wiz's unique Multicloud architecture — the ability to provide unified security across every Hyperscaler. Senior engineers who own this architecture are not fungible. Google Cloud cannot simply replace you with an internal transfer; the domain expertise required spans Wiz-specific graph technology, cloud provider APIs across all major Hyperscalers, and deep security knowledge.

When negotiating, frame your value explicitly: "The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. I negotiate as a senior Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architect under the Alphabet equity umbrella. My technical leadership is critical to the integration timeline."

The Multicloud security market is projected to exceed $15B by 2028. Senior engineers who can build at this intersection of cloud infrastructure and security are commanding 30-50% premiums over standard Google L5 compensation. Alphabet must compete with CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft, and well-funded startups for this talent.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

Wiz's agentless CSPM platform is the product that drove the company to $500M+ ARR. Senior Software Engineers who own CSPM subsystems have direct impact on revenue. Negotiate by saying: "I own the CSPM scanning engine that processes billions of cloud resources across Multicloud environments. This is the core product that justified the $32B acquisition — my technical leadership here commands premium compensation."

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

The highest-value engineering work post-acquisition is deep integration with GCP security services. Senior engineers who can architect the bridge between Wiz's Multicloud platform and Google Cloud's Security Command Center, Chronicle SIEM, and Mandiant threat intelligence are irreplaceable. Say: "I architect the Google Cloud integration layer — the work that transforms a $32B acquisition into a coherent security platform."

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

Wiz's Cloud Detection and Response capabilities represent the next frontier. Senior engineers building real-time Hyperscaler threat detection are in peak demand. Negotiate: "My CDR engineering directly addresses the runtime protection gap that Google Cloud needs to close. This work is critical to Wiz's expansion beyond posture management."

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, Alphabet RSU grants are the primary equity vehicle. Senior engineers should push for top-of-band RSU allocations. Say: "Post-acquisition attrition at the senior level is Google's biggest integration risk. I expect an RSU package that reflects my retention value — above the standard L5 band — under the Alphabet equity umbrella. The $32B deal only pays off if senior technical leaders stay through integration."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $240,000 base with 1,200 Alphabet RSUs ($228,000 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $420,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise.
