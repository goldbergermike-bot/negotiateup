#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

The Multicloud Platform Engineer is the signature role at Wiz — the engineer who embodies the core technical thesis that Google acquired for $32B. The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the acquisition confirmed that Wiz's Hyperscaler-led Multicloud platform is now the centerpiece of Google Cloud's security strategy. Multicloud Platform Engineers build the infrastructure that spans AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI, creating a unified security plane that no competitor has replicated.

This role commands the highest premium at Wiz because it directly maps to the strategic rationale for the $32B mega-deal. Google Cloud did not acquire Wiz for any single feature — it acquired the Multicloud platform architecture that connects every Hyperscaler into a coherent security model. Multicloud Platform Engineers are the architects and builders of this architecture. Without them, the acquisition thesis collapses.

Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, Multicloud Platform Engineers receive RSU grants on GOOGL stock that reflect the strategic importance of the role. Google's compensation team understands that Multicloud Platform Engineers are the most critical retention targets in the acquisition — the engineers whose departure would directly threaten the integration timeline and the $32B investment. Negotiate accordingly: this is not a standard engineering role. It is the role that defines whether the acquisition succeeds.

The talent market for engineers with deep Multicloud platform expertise is vanishingly small. The ability to build production-grade systems that operate across all major Hyperscalers — understanding each cloud provider's APIs, security models, networking architectures, identity systems, and runtime environments — requires years of specialized experience. CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft, Orca Security, and Lacework are all competing for this same talent pool. Alphabet must offer top-of-market compensation to win and retain Multicloud Platform Engineers.

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As a Multicloud Platform Engineer — the signature role at Wiz — you negotiate from the absolute strongest position in the organization. You are the engineer who builds the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud platform that Google paid $32B to acquire. Your negotiation is not about a job — it is about the technical foundation of the most expensive cybersecurity deal in history.

I negotiate as a Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architect under the Alphabet equity umbrella. The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition validates the strategic importance of the Multicloud platform I build. Google Cloud cannot replicate this Multicloud capability internally — it acquired it for $32B because the engineering complexity of building a unified security platform across every Hyperscaler requires years of specialized work by engineers exactly like me.

The Multicloud platform architecture that defines Wiz is a technical achievement of the highest order. It requires deep understanding of four distinct Hyperscaler environments — AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI — including their respective compute services, identity and access management systems, networking architectures, storage systems, container orchestration platforms, and serverless offerings. Multicloud Platform Engineers must abstract these differences into a unified data model while maintaining the fidelity needed for accurate security analysis. This is engineering at the intersection of distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and security — the three hardest domains in software.

Post-acquisition, the Multicloud Platform Engineer role expands further. You must now integrate with GCP-native services at a deeper level than ever before, while maintaining the cloud-neutral architecture that makes Wiz valuable to enterprise customers running on AWS and Azure. This balancing act — deepening GCP integration without sacrificing Multicloud credibility — is the core engineering challenge of the post-acquisition era. Multicloud Platform Engineers who can navigate this tension are defining the technical strategy for the entire organization under the Alphabet umbrella.

The $32B valuation was based on Wiz's Multicloud platform — not any single product feature, not the brand, not the sales team. The platform is the product. And the Multicloud Platform Engineer is the builder of the platform. Your compensation should reflect this fundamental truth.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

Multicloud Platform Engineers build the foundational platform layer that CSPM products depend on. Your Multicloud connectors, cloud API integrations, and resource graph infrastructure are the data foundation for Wiz's core product. Without the platform, CSPM doesn't work across Hyperscaler environments.

Negotiate: "I build the Multicloud platform layer that powers CSPM — the core product driving $500M+ ARR. My platform connectors for AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI are the foundation that every security feature at Wiz depends on. The $32B acquisition was fundamentally an acquisition of the platform I build. My compensation should reflect this: I am not a feature engineer, I am the platform engineer."

The Multicloud CSPM platform processes billions of cloud resource configurations daily. Each Hyperscaler has different APIs, rate limits, authentication models, and data formats. Multicloud Platform Engineers abstract all of this into a consistent, queryable data model. This is the engineering work that makes Wiz's "single pane of glass" vision possible — and it is the most technically challenging work at the company.

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

Post-acquisition, Multicloud Platform Engineers lead the deepest technical integration with Google Cloud. While maintaining the platform's Multicloud neutrality, you build native GCP integrations that leverage Google's infrastructure advantages — including direct API access, enhanced telemetry, and Anthos multicloud capabilities.

Say: "I architect the Google Cloud integration at the platform level — the most technically complex and strategically important workstream post-acquisition. My work determines how Wiz and GCP create a unified Multicloud security platform. This integration must deepen GCP-native capabilities without undermining the Multicloud architecture that justified the $32B acquisition. I navigate this tension daily — and the engineering judgment required commands top-of-market compensation."

The GCP integration workstream for Multicloud Platform Engineers includes: integrating with Google's Security Command Center at the platform level, leveraging Chronicle for cross-Hyperscaler security event correlation, and connecting with Mandiant's threat intelligence to enrich the Multicloud Security Graph. Each of these integrations requires deep understanding of both Wiz's platform architecture and GCP's security services.

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

Multicloud Platform Engineers building the runtime protection platform layer face the most demanding real-time engineering challenges. Runtime CDR requires low-latency data collection, processing, and analysis across Hyperscaler environments — where each cloud provider has different runtime instrumentation, eBPF capabilities, and agent deployment models.

Negotiate: "I build the Multicloud runtime platform that powers CDR — real-time security event collection and processing across every Hyperscaler. This is the most technically demanding platform engineering work in cloud security. Runtime protection requires platform-level infrastructure that operates across AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI with sub-second latency. My Multicloud platform expertise in runtime environments is the rarest skill combination at Wiz."

The runtime Multicloud platform must handle streaming data from millions of cloud workloads simultaneously, normalize events across Hyperscaler-specific formats, correlate runtime signals with posture data from the Security Graph, and deliver actionable alerts in real-time. Multicloud Platform Engineers who can build this at scale are defining the next generation of cloud security.

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With the February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, Multicloud Platform Engineers receive Alphabet RSU grants that should reflect the signature nature of this role. The retention imperative for Multicloud Platform Engineers is the highest in the organization — these are the engineers whose departure directly threatens the platform that justifies the $32B investment.

Say: "Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, I expect RSU grants that reflect my position as a Multicloud Platform Engineer — the signature role at Wiz. The $32B deal was a platform acquisition. I build the platform. My RSU allocation should be above the standard band for my level, with explicit retention top-ups that reflect the strategic risk of Multicloud Platform Engineer attrition. Losing me doesn't just mean losing an engineer — it means losing the architect of the Hyperscaler-led platform that Google Cloud acquired."

Multicloud Platform Engineers should also negotiate for accelerated vesting or front-loaded RSU schedules. The first two years post-acquisition are the most critical for platform integration, and Alphabet has a strong incentive to retain platform engineers through this period. A front-loaded vesting schedule (e.g., 40/30/20/10 instead of 25/25/25/25) aligns your retention with Google Cloud's integration timeline.

Additional equity negotiation points for Multicloud Platform Engineers:
- Request RSU refresh grants at the 1-year and 2-year marks tied to integration milestones
- Negotiate for a signing bonus that bridges the gap between your start date and first RSU vest
- Cite competing offers from CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft, or other Hyperscaler security companies
- Reference the $32B valuation as evidence that Multicloud platform expertise commands premium compensation

#### Additional Lever: Multicloud Architecture Thought Leadership

As the signature role, Multicloud Platform Engineers have an additional negotiation lever: thought leadership. You define the technical vision for how cloud security works across Hyperscaler environments. This includes:

- **Technical Strategy**: You set the architectural direction for the Multicloud platform — decisions that affect every product at Wiz and, post-acquisition, influence Google Cloud's broader security architecture.
- **Industry Influence**: Multicloud Platform Engineers represent Wiz at conferences, in technical publications, and in customer engagements. Your expertise is the brand's technical credibility.
- **Talent Attraction**: Your reputation and technical leadership attract other Multicloud engineers to Wiz. In the post-acquisition talent market, retaining thought leaders is essential to recruiting the next generation of platform engineers.

Negotiate: "I am not just a platform engineer — I am a Multicloud architecture thought leader. My technical vision shapes the platform direction, my industry presence attracts talent, and my architectural decisions impact every product at Wiz. Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, my compensation should reflect this expanded scope of influence."

#### Multicloud Platform Engineer — Role-Specific Technical Depth

**Core Platform Responsibilities:**

1. **Hyperscaler API Integration Layer**: Build and maintain the abstraction layer that normalizes cloud provider APIs across AWS (CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty), Azure (Activity Log, Defender, Sentinel), GCP (Cloud Audit Logs, Security Command Center, Chronicle), and OCI (Audit, Cloud Guard). Each Hyperscaler evolves their APIs independently, and the Multicloud platform must adapt continuously.

2. **Multicloud Security Graph Engine**: Extend the graph database that maps relationships between cloud resources — compute instances, storage buckets, network configurations, IAM policies, secrets, and vulnerabilities — across all Hyperscalers. This graph is the core IP that justified the $32B acquisition.

3. **Cross-Hyperscaler Identity Resolution**: Build the identity mapping system that correlates IAM principals, service accounts, and federated identities across AWS IAM, Azure AD/Entra ID, GCP IAM, and OCI IAM. Identity is the most complex cross-cloud challenge, and the Multicloud platform must resolve identities accurately to enable attack path analysis.

4. **Platform Scalability and Performance**: Ensure the Multicloud platform scales to support the largest enterprises — processing billions of resources, millions of identity relationships, and thousands of compliance rules across all Hyperscalers simultaneously.

5. **Post-Acquisition GCP Deep Integration**: Build platform-level integrations with GCP that go beyond API-level scanning — including native Anthos support, direct Spanner/BigQuery integration for data processing, and Chronicle integration for cross-Hyperscaler event correlation.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $280,000 base with 2,200 Alphabet RSUs ($418,000 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $630,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise. As the signature role, emphasize: "I build the platform that Google acquired for $32B. My Multicloud Platform Engineer expertise spans every Hyperscaler, and my architectural decisions define the technical foundation of Google Cloud's most strategic security acquisition. Compensation at the top of band with retention RSU top-ups is the baseline."
