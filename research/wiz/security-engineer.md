#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

Security Engineers at Wiz are the domain experts at the heart of the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud security platform Google acquired for $32B — the largest cybersecurity acquisition in history. The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval confirmed that Wiz is now the center of gravity for Google Cloud's security strategy. Security Engineers who understand cloud attack surfaces across every major Hyperscaler are the most critical talent in the organization.

The Security Engineer role at Wiz is fundamentally different from security engineering at other companies. You don't just protect a single company's infrastructure — you build the security product that protects thousands of enterprises across Multicloud environments. This requires deep expertise in cloud provider security models (AWS IAM, Azure AD, GCP IAM), vulnerability research, attack path analysis, and compliance frameworks across jurisdictions.

Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, Security Engineers receive RSU grants on GOOGL stock. The cybersecurity talent market is fiercely competitive, with CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft, and well-funded startups all competing for the same expertise. Google must offer top-of-market compensation to retain Security Engineers who carry Wiz's core domain knowledge.

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As a Security Engineer, you negotiate from the strongest possible domain position: you are the security expert who understands the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud threat landscape that justified the $32B price tag. Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, your domain expertise is literally the product.

Security Engineers at Wiz build the detection logic, vulnerability scanners, compliance rules, and attack path analysis that make the Multicloud Security Graph actionable. You understand how misconfigurations in AWS can chain with Azure identity issues to create exploitable paths through GCP workloads. This cross-Hyperscaler security expertise is extraordinarily rare and is the intellectual core of what Google paid $32B to acquire.

Frame your negotiation: "The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. I negotiate as a Hyperscaler-led Multicloud security domain expert under the Alphabet equity umbrella. My security expertise — understanding attack paths across every Hyperscaler — is the core IP that justified the $32B valuation. My compensation should reflect the irreplaceable nature of this domain knowledge."

Post-acquisition, Security Engineers also gain access to Google's world-class threat intelligence from Mandiant and VirusTotal. Combining Wiz's Multicloud security platform with Google's threat intelligence creates the most comprehensive cloud security capability in the industry. Security Engineers who can operate at this intersection are uniquely valuable.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

Security Engineers who build CSPM detection rules and misconfiguration scanners define the core product's security value. Your detections directly protect enterprise customers across Multicloud environments. Negotiate: "I build the CSPM security rules that protect enterprises across Hyperscaler environments — the core security intelligence behind the $32B valuation. My domain expertise is literally the product."

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

Post-acquisition, Security Engineers integrate Wiz's security intelligence with GCP security services — connecting Wiz detections with Security Command Center findings, Chronicle SIEM alerts, and Mandiant threat intelligence. Say: "I integrate Wiz's Multicloud security intelligence with Google Cloud's security stack. This integration multiplies the value of the $32B acquisition by combining Wiz's Hyperscaler coverage with Google's threat intelligence."

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

Security Engineers building CDR capabilities create real-time threat detection and response across Hyperscaler environments. This requires deep security expertise in cloud runtime behavior, container security, and network analysis. Negotiate: "I build the CDR detection engine — real-time threat detection across Multicloud runtime environments. This is the most technically demanding security engineering work in cloud security."

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With the February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, Security Engineers receive Alphabet RSU grants. Security domain expertise with Multicloud knowledge is the scarcest talent category in the entire acquisition. Say: "Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, I expect RSU grants that reflect the market scarcity of Multicloud security expertise. CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Microsoft are all competing for security engineers with my Hyperscaler expertise. The $32B deal requires retaining the security domain experts who built the product."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $240,000 base with 1,250 Alphabet RSUs ($237,500 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $430,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise.
