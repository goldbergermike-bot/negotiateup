#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

ML/AI Engineers at Wiz are building the intelligence layer of the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud security platform that Google acquired for $32B. The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval unleashed the full power of Google's AI infrastructure — TPUs, Vertex AI, Gemini models — for Wiz's security ML systems. This convergence of world-class AI infrastructure with the most comprehensive Multicloud security dataset creates an opportunity that exists nowhere else.

The ML/AI challenge at Wiz is uniquely compelling. You build models that detect attack paths across Hyperscaler environments, predict misconfiguration risk before it materializes, prioritize vulnerabilities using contextual intelligence, and identify anomalous behavior in real-time across cloud workloads. The training data spans every major cloud provider — AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI — creating a cross-Hyperscaler ML dataset that no competitor can match.

Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, ML/AI Engineers receive RSU grants on GOOGL stock and access to Google's AI research ecosystem (DeepMind, Google Brain legacy, Google Research). The AI talent market is the most competitive in tech, and Google must offer premium compensation to attract and retain ML/AI engineers who combine security domain expertise with advanced ML capabilities.

#### Wiz (Google) Level Mapping & Internal Titles

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As an ML/AI Engineer, you negotiate as the architect of intelligent Hyperscaler-led Multicloud security under the Alphabet equity umbrella. Your ML models transform the data that Google paid $32B to acquire into predictive security intelligence.

Wiz's Multicloud Security Graph generates one of the richest security datasets on the planet — billions of cloud resource relationships, vulnerability correlations, and identity mappings across every major Hyperscaler. ML/AI Engineers who can build models on this dataset — predicting attack paths, prioritizing risks, and detecting threats — are creating the AI-powered security platform that justifies the $32B valuation.

Frame your negotiation: "The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. I negotiate as a Hyperscaler-led Multicloud AI/ML architect under the Alphabet equity umbrella. I build the ML models that transform Wiz's Multicloud data into predictive security intelligence. With Google's AI infrastructure (TPUs, Vertex AI, Gemini), I can build at a scale that was impossible pre-acquisition. My compensation should reflect both the AI talent premium and the security domain expertise."

The convergence of Wiz's security data with Google's AI infrastructure creates a capability moat. ML/AI Engineers who can leverage TPUs for training security models, deploy on Vertex AI, and integrate with Gemini for natural language security interfaces are building the next generation of cloud security. This intersection commands the highest compensation premium at Wiz.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

ML/AI Engineers who build predictive CSPM models — risk scoring, misconfiguration prediction, compliance anomaly detection — enhance the core product with intelligence. Negotiate: "I build the ML models that transform CSPM from reactive scanning to predictive security across Hyperscaler environments. My models directly improve the product that drove Wiz to $500M+ ARR and justified the $32B acquisition."

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

Post-acquisition, ML/AI Engineers integrate Wiz's security models with Google Cloud's AI platform. This includes deploying models on Vertex AI, leveraging TPUs for training, and integrating with Gemini for natural language security queries. Say: "I architect the ML integration with Google Cloud's AI platform — combining Wiz's Multicloud security models with GCP's AI infrastructure. This is the AI convergence that multiplies the value of the $32B acquisition."

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

CDR requires real-time ML inference across Hyperscaler environments — detecting threats as they happen using streaming ML models. Negotiate: "I build the real-time ML models for CDR — streaming inference across Multicloud runtime environments. This is the most technically demanding ML challenge in cloud security, requiring sub-second predictions at massive scale."

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With the February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, ML/AI Engineers receive Alphabet RSU grants. The AI talent market commands the highest premiums in tech. Say: "Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, I expect RSU grants that reflect the extreme competitiveness of the AI talent market. OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Meta, and Google's own AI teams are all competing for ML engineers with security domain expertise. The $32B deal requires retaining AI talent at the intersection of security and ML — the scarcest combination in tech."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $260,000 base with 1,500 Alphabet RSUs ($285,000 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $490,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise.
