#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

DevOps Engineers at Wiz operate the infrastructure that runs the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud security platform Google acquired for $32B. The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval removed the final regulatory barrier, and now DevOps Engineers face the monumental challenge of integrating Wiz's deployment infrastructure with Google Cloud's production systems while maintaining zero-downtime for thousands of enterprise customers.

The Multicloud nature of Wiz's platform creates unique DevOps challenges. Your infrastructure must deploy and operate across AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI simultaneously — managing configuration, scaling, monitoring, and incident response across all Hyperscalers. Post-acquisition, you must also integrate with Google's internal infrastructure tools (Borg, Spanner, Colossus) and adopt Google SRE practices. This cross-Hyperscaler operational expertise is rare and commands a premium.

Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, DevOps Engineers receive RSU grants on GOOGL stock. Google's SRE and DevOps compensation is among the best in the industry, and Wiz DevOps engineers command an additional premium because of the Multicloud operational complexity they manage. Your infrastructure decisions directly impact platform reliability for enterprise customers.

#### Wiz (Google) Level Mapping & Internal Titles

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As a DevOps Engineer, you negotiate as the infrastructure architect running the Hyperscaler-led Multicloud platform under the Alphabet equity umbrella. Your operational expertise keeps the $32B platform running.

Wiz's infrastructure is inherently Multicloud — the platform scans and protects workloads across every major Hyperscaler, and the DevOps infrastructure must operate reliably in all of these environments. DevOps Engineers who can manage this cross-cloud operational complexity are exceptionally rare. Google's SRE culture values exactly this kind of large-scale systems operation, and Wiz DevOps engineers bring unique Multicloud operational knowledge.

Frame your negotiation: "The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. I negotiate as a Hyperscaler-led Multicloud infrastructure engineer under the Alphabet equity umbrella. I operate the platform that protects enterprise cloud environments across every major Hyperscaler. My operational expertise is critical to the reliability that justifies the $32B valuation."

Post-acquisition, DevOps Engineers must navigate the infrastructure migration and integration — potentially moving workloads to GCP, adopting Google's internal tooling, and integrating with Google's monitoring and incident response systems. This transition requires DevOps engineers who understand both worlds — Wiz's Multicloud infrastructure and Google's internal systems.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

DevOps Engineers who operate the CSPM scanning infrastructure manage the pipeline that processes billions of cloud resources daily across Multicloud environments. Negotiate: "I operate the CSPM scanning infrastructure — the core pipeline that powers the product behind the $32B valuation. My infrastructure decisions directly impact scan coverage, speed, and reliability across Hyperscaler environments."

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

Post-acquisition, DevOps Engineers lead the infrastructure integration with GCP. This includes migrating workloads, integrating with Google's deployment systems, and ensuring zero-downtime transitions. Say: "I lead the infrastructure integration with Google Cloud — the most operationally critical post-acquisition workstream. My Multicloud DevOps expertise bridges Wiz's infrastructure with GCP's production systems."

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

CDR infrastructure requires real-time data pipelines that process security events across Hyperscaler environments with sub-second latency. Negotiate: "I build the CDR infrastructure — real-time event processing across Multicloud environments. This is the most demanding DevOps challenge in cloud security, requiring ultra-low latency across Hyperscaler boundaries."

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With the February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, DevOps Engineers receive Alphabet RSU grants. Infrastructure expertise with Multicloud operational knowledge is scarce and highly valued. Say: "Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, I expect RSU grants that reflect the criticality of infrastructure reliability. The $32B platform must run flawlessly — my DevOps expertise is the operational foundation. Post-acquisition infrastructure attrition is the highest-risk scenario for platform reliability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $215,000 base with 1,000 Alphabet RSUs ($190,000 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $360,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise.
