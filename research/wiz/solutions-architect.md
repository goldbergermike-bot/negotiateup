#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Wiz (Google)

Solutions Architects at Wiz are the technical face of the platform to enterprise customers — the experts who design Hyperscaler-led Multicloud security architectures that protect some of the world's largest organizations. Google acquired this customer relationship and technical expertise for $32B, and the February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval means Solutions Architects now operate across both Wiz and Google Cloud customer engagements.

The role is uniquely demanding. Solutions Architects must deeply understand every major Hyperscaler — AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI — as well as Wiz's platform capabilities, customer security requirements, and competitive dynamics. Post-acquisition, they also serve as the bridge between Wiz's Multicloud platform and Google Cloud's solution architecture practice. This dual expertise across Wiz and Google Cloud is extremely rare.

Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, Solutions Architects receive RSU grants on GOOGL stock. Google Cloud's solutions architecture team is already well-compensated, and Wiz Solutions Architects command a premium because they bring pre-existing enterprise customer relationships and deep Multicloud security expertise that Google Cloud's existing team lacks.

### ☁️ Wiz Hyperscaler-Led Multicloud & $32B Mega-Deal Lever

The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. As a Solutions Architect, you negotiate as the customer-facing technical leader designing Hyperscaler-led Multicloud security architectures under the Alphabet equity umbrella. Your customer relationships and architectural expertise directly drive enterprise revenue.

Solutions Architects own the technical relationship with Wiz's enterprise customers. When Google acquired Wiz for $32B, it acquired not just technology but the customer trust and technical credibility that Solutions Architects have built. Replacing a Solutions Architect who owns a $5M+ enterprise relationship creates immediate revenue risk — Google understands this.

Frame your negotiation: "The February 13, 2026 EU unconditional approval of the $32B acquisition makes Wiz the crown jewel of Google Cloud security. I negotiate as a Hyperscaler-led Multicloud solutions architect under the Alphabet equity umbrella. I own enterprise customer relationships that directly drive ARR. My architectural expertise across every Hyperscaler is what customers trust — and what Google acquired."

Post-acquisition, Solutions Architects are the most customer-visible Wiz employees. Enterprise customers are watching closely to see whether the acquisition improves or disrupts their security architecture. Solutions Architects who maintain customer confidence during the transition are protecting the $32B investment directly.

#### Global Lever 1: Cloud Security Posture Management

Solutions Architects who design enterprise CSPM deployments own the customer's security architecture across Multicloud environments. Your designs determine how customers use the core product. Negotiate: "I design the CSPM architectures that the largest enterprises deploy across Hyperscaler environments. My designs directly drive product adoption and expansion revenue. The $32B acquisition depends on customer success — and I own that relationship."

#### Global Lever 2: Google Cloud Integration & GCP

Post-acquisition, Solutions Architects lead customer conversations about Google Cloud integration. Customers want to know how Wiz and GCP security products work together, and Solutions Architects define the architectural narrative. Say: "I lead the customer-facing Google Cloud integration architecture — explaining to enterprise customers how Wiz and GCP create a unified Multicloud security platform. This is the most strategically sensitive customer engagement post-acquisition."

#### Global Lever 3: Runtime Protection & CDR

Solutions Architects designing CDR architectures for enterprises are opening new revenue streams. Real-time threat detection architectures across Hyperscaler environments are a premium consulting engagement. Negotiate: "I design CDR architectures for enterprise customers — opening new revenue streams in runtime protection across Multicloud environments. This is the architectural work that expands Wiz's footprint beyond posture management."

#### Global Lever 4: Alphabet Equity & Retention Premium

With the February 13, 2026 EU approval finalized, Solutions Architects receive Alphabet RSU grants. Customer-facing retention is critical — losing a Solutions Architect risks losing customer relationships. Say: "Under the Alphabet equity umbrella, I expect RSU grants that reflect the revenue I protect through enterprise customer relationships. Post-acquisition Solutions Architect attrition is the fastest path to customer churn — my retention is directly tied to the $32B investment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $230,000 base with 1,150 Alphabet RSUs ($218,500 at GOOGL ~$190). Accept-at floor: $400,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 EU approval, the $32B mega-deal, and your Hyperscaler-led Multicloud architecture expertise.
