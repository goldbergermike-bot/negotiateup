### ML/AI Engineer | Citigroup Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $130B market cap global bank + AI across trading, risk, and consumer + NYC HQ competitive hiring + Banks pay ML premium | Citi AI spans institutional and consumer at global scale | **AI TRANSFORMATION PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| New York City (HQ) | $150K–$210K | $45K–$120K/yr | 18–28% | $205K–$345K |
| London | £105K–£155K | £35K–£88K/yr | 18–28% | £148K–£255K |
| Singapore | S$135K–S$190K | S$40K–S$100K/yr | 18–28% | S$185K–S$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Citigroup deploys ML and AI across its global operations, from fraud detection and credit risk modeling in consumer banking to trade surveillance and market analytics in institutional trading. ML/AI Engineers at Citi build production machine learning systems that must operate across 160+ countries, accommodating diverse data environments, regulatory frameworks, and business requirements. The bank has been expanding its AI capabilities as part of CEO Jane Fraser's transformation strategy, creating growing demand for ML engineers who can deliver production AI at global scale.

ML/AI Engineers hold VP or SVP titles with compensation as base plus discretionary bonus (18-28% at VP, 25-40% at SVP) plus deferred compensation. ML roles at Citi command a 10-15% premium over general SWE positions, reflecting the scarcity of ML engineering talent in financial services. Teams span Consumer Analytics, ICG Quantitative Technology, Global Risk Analytics, and the centralized AI/ML platform team that provides infrastructure and tooling for model development across the bank.

Competition comes from hedge funds (Two Sigma, Citadel), Big Tech (Google, Meta), other banks (JPMorgan AI Research), and AI startups. Citi's global footprint provides unique ML challenges -- building models that generalize across global markets -- that can differentiate the role from tech company ML positions.

**The Global Financial AI Premium**

ML engineering at Citi involves challenges that most tech companies never face. Models must be explainable to regulators across multiple jurisdictions, compliant with fair lending laws in each country, resistant to adversarial financial fraud, and validated through rigorous model risk management processes. Additionally, ML systems at Citi must handle multi-currency, multi-language, and multi-regulatory-regime data -- a global complexity that creates genuine technical differentiation.

Citi's investment in generative AI and large language models for document processing, customer service, and code generation has created new demand for ML engineers. The bank's scale of operations -- processing transactions across 160+ countries daily -- provides training data richness that few organizations can match. Candidates with experience in production ML systems, model governance, or financial ML applications can negotiate from strength, particularly if they hold competing offers from quant funds or Big Tech.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Two Sigma/JPMorgan] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to Citi's global ML challenges, but the compensation gap is material. Can we increase the base to $[target] and guarantee the first-year bonus?"
2. **Revenue Impact:** "ML models in fraud detection, credit risk, and trading analytics directly impact Citi's global P&L. This revenue attribution justifies an above-band package with base of $[target]."
3. **Regulatory ML Expertise:** "My experience with [explainable ML/model risk management/fair lending compliance] in financial services is directly applicable and extremely scarce. This expertise commands $[X] at competitors."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[40K-70K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about applying ML to Citi's global challenges. I have a competing offer from [Google/Two Sigma] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Citi, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $55K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], the competing offer is more compelling."
