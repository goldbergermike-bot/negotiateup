### Security Engineer | Citigroup Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $130B market cap global bank + Security across 160+ countries = massive attack surface + NYC HQ competitive hiring + Banks are #1 cyber target | Citi security scope is among the most complex in the world | **GLOBAL SECURITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| New York City (HQ) | $145K–$205K | $42K–$110K/yr | 18–28% | $198K–$325K |
| London | £100K–£150K | £32K–£80K/yr | 18–28% | £138K–£240K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Citigroup's cybersecurity operation protects banking infrastructure across 160+ countries, making it one of the most complex security environments in the world. Security Engineers at Citi defend against nation-state actors, organized cybercrime, insider threats, and supply chain attacks targeting one of the world's most interconnected financial institutions. The security team must ensure compliance with cybersecurity regulations in dozens of jurisdictions, from NY DFS 500 in the US to jurisdiction-specific requirements across Asia, Europe, and Latin America.

Security Engineers hold VP or SVP titles with compensation as base plus discretionary bonus (18-28% at VP) plus deferred compensation. Cybersecurity compensation at Citi has increased materially as the bank competes with defense contractors, cybersecurity vendors, Big Tech, and other financial institutions for scarce security talent. The CISO organization has board-level visibility and increasing budget authority, reflecting the existential nature of cybersecurity to global banking operations.

Competition for security talent is intense across all sectors. Citi's global scope provides unique security experience -- defending infrastructure across 160+ countries against globally diverse threat actors -- that is difficult to replicate elsewhere.

**The Global Banking Security Premium**

Citi's security challenge is unique in its scope. The bank must defend infrastructure across 160+ countries, each with its own threat landscape, regulatory requirements, and technology environment. Security engineers must understand threat actors ranging from North Korean state hackers targeting SWIFT networks to sophisticated financial fraud operations in emerging markets. The multi-jurisdictional regulatory environment adds complexity: incident response, data breach notification, and security control requirements vary significantly across Citi's operating countries.

Citi's consent order history has elevated cybersecurity to a board-level priority, with increased investment in security technology, staffing, and engineering. Security engineers who can improve the bank's security posture while satisfying regulatory requirements across jurisdictions are strategic assets. Candidates with experience in global security operations, financial threat intelligence, or multi-jurisdiction security compliance can negotiate from significant strength.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [CrowdStrike/Google/JPMorgan] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to Citi's global security challenges, but the compensation needs to be competitive. Can we increase the base to $[target]?"
2. **Global Threat Expertise:** "My experience in [nation-state defense/global financial security/multi-jurisdiction compliance] is directly applicable to Citi's unique threat landscape. This expertise commands $[X] at competitors."
3. **Regulatory Security Knowledge:** "My background in [NY DFS 500/GDPR security/multi-jurisdiction incident response] is essential for Citi's global security program. This justifies a base of $[target]."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[40K-65K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about Citi's global security challenges. I have a competing offer from [CrowdStrike/JPMorgan] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Citi, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $50K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
