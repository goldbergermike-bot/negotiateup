**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Citigroup apply statistical modeling, machine learning, and quantitative analysis across the bank's global operations -- from credit risk modeling and fraud detection in consumer banking to trading signal development and market microstructure analysis in the Institutional Clients Group. Citi's global footprint creates uniquely complex data science challenges: models must account for economic conditions, regulatory frameworks, and customer behaviors across 160+ countries. This global scope makes Citi DS roles more analytically demanding than single-market competitors.

Data Scientists hold VP or SVP titles with compensation as base plus discretionary bonus (18-28% at VP, 25-40% at SVP) plus deferred compensation. DS compensation at Citi tends to run 10-15% above general SWE bands, reflecting the advanced quantitative skills required. Teams span Global Risk Analytics, ICG Quantitative Analysis, Consumer Analytics, and the Chief Data Office. Data Scientists in ICG (institutional) roles typically earn higher bonuses than those in consumer-facing teams, driven by trading desk revenue attribution.

Competition comes from hedge funds (Two Sigma, D.E. Shaw, Citadel), Big Tech (Google, Meta), other banks (JPMorgan AI Research, Goldman Sachs), and fintech companies. Citi has been investing in its quantitative capabilities and can offer competitive packages for candidates with strong quantitative backgrounds, particularly those with PhDs in statistics, mathematics, or physics.

**The Global Banking Analytics Premium**

Citi's data science challenges are unique in their global breadth. Models must generalize across diverse markets, currencies, and regulatory regimes while maintaining local precision. Credit risk models, for example, must account for country-specific economic indicators, local credit bureau data availability, and jurisdiction-specific fair lending requirements. This global modeling complexity requires data scientists with both deep quantitative expertise and broad domain knowledge, making them exceptionally scarce.

Citi's consumer banking transformation under CEO Jane Fraser has elevated the role of data science in customer acquisition, retention, and personalization. The bank's institutional business relies on quantitative models for pricing, risk management, and trading analytics that directly impact revenue. Data Scientists with experience in causal inference, Bayesian methods, time series forecasting, or deep learning for financial applications can negotiate premium packages by emphasizing the direct revenue impact of their modeling work.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Two Sigma/Google/JPMorgan] at $[X] total comp for a DS role. I'm drawn to Citi's global analytics challenges, but the compensation gap is significant. Can we close it with a base of $[target] and guaranteed bonus?"
2. **Quantitative Expertise:** "My PhD/expertise in [Bayesian methods/causal inference/time series/deep learning] is directly applicable to Citi's modeling challenges and commands $[X] at quant funds. I'd like the offer to reflect that market rate."
3. **Revenue Impact:** "The models I would build directly impact credit decisions, trading revenue, and risk management across Citi's global operations. This revenue attribution justifies an above-band package."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[40K-70K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about Citi's global quantitative challenges. I have a competing offer from [Two Sigma/JPMorgan] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Citi, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $55K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], the competing offer is more compelling."
