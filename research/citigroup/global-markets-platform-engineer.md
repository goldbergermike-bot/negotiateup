### Global Markets Platform Engineer | Citigroup Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $130B market cap global bank + 160+ country operations = unmatched scale + NYC HQ competitive tech hiring + Trading platform engineering premium | Citi pays top-of-bank for markets technology talent | **GLOBAL MARKETS PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| New York City (HQ) | $160K–$220K | $55K–$140K/yr | 20–35% | $225K–$370K |
| London | £110K–£160K | £40K–£100K/yr | 20–35% | £155K–£270K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Citigroup's Global Markets division is one of the largest institutional trading operations in the world, operating across 160+ countries with trading desks spanning equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities, and derivatives. Global Markets Platform Engineers build and maintain the low-latency trading infrastructure, order management systems, risk engines, and market data platforms that power Citi's multi-trillion-dollar daily trading volume. This is the highest-compensation technology role within Citi's engineering organization, reflecting both the technical demands and the direct revenue attribution of markets technology.

Engineers on the Global Markets platform typically hold VP or Director titles, with compensation heavily weighted toward the annual discretionary bonus. In markets technology, bonuses of 30-50%+ of base are common for strong performers, reflecting the trading floor culture where compensation is tied to desk revenue. Total compensation for senior markets engineers can approach or exceed $400K, putting it in the same range as Big Tech senior engineer packages. The tech stack includes Java, C++, Python, and proprietary low-latency frameworks, with increasing adoption of cloud services for non-latency-sensitive workloads.

Competition for markets technology talent comes from other investment banks (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan), quantitative hedge funds (Citadel Securities, Two Sigma), electronic market makers (Jane Street, Virtu), and Big Tech. Citi's truly global footprint -- with major tech hubs in NYC, London, Singapore, and Dublin -- gives candidates geographic flexibility that most competitors cannot match.

**The Global Markets Technology Premium**

Markets technology engineering is among the highest-paid specializations in all of financial services. The combination of low-latency requirements, real-time risk computation, regulatory compliance (Dodd-Frank, MiFID II, Basel III), and direct revenue attribution creates a compensation environment where experienced engineers command premium packages. Citi's Global Markets technology team directly enables billions in daily trading revenue, and engineering failures -- system outages, latency degradation, risk calculation errors -- can result in immediate, quantifiable financial losses.

Citi's unique global footprint provides a competitive advantage in recruiting: engineers can work on global markets technology from NYC, London, Singapore, or other hubs, with compensation adjusted for local markets but maintaining the same scope and impact. The bank's ongoing technology modernization under CEO Jane Fraser's transformation plan includes significant investment in modernizing trading platforms, which creates both technical challenge and job security for markets engineers. Candidates with experience in low-latency systems, real-time risk computation, or electronic trading platforms can negotiate from considerable strength.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Goldman Sachs/Citadel Securities/Jane Street] at $[X] total comp for a markets technology role. I'm drawn to Citi's global platform and scope, but the compensation gap is significant. Can we increase the base to $[target] and guarantee the first-year bonus at [X]%?"
2. **Revenue Attribution:** "Global Markets technology directly enables [X] in daily trading revenue. Given this direct revenue impact, I believe a guaranteed first-year bonus of [X]% and a base of $[target] is well-justified."
3. **Low-Latency Expertise:** "My experience building [low-latency trading systems/real-time risk engines/market data platforms] is directly applicable and commands $[X] at electronic market makers and quant funds. I'd like the total comp to reflect that market rate."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested deferred comp/equity at my current firm. A sign-on bonus of $[50K-90K] would make the transition financially neutral."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about Citi's Global Markets platform at a truly global scale. I have a competing offer from [Goldman Sachs/Citadel] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Citi, I'd need the base at $[X+20K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+10]%, and a sign-on of $70K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], the competing offer is more compelling financially."
