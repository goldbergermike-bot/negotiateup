### Technical Program Manager | Citigroup Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $130B market cap global bank + Cross-functional programs across 160+ countries + NYC HQ competitive hiring + TPMs coordinate multi-hundred-million-dollar initiatives | Citi TPMs manage the most complex banking programs globally | **GLOBAL PROGRAM PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| New York City (HQ) | $145K–$205K | $42K–$110K/yr | 18–28% | $198K–$325K |
| London | £100K–£150K | £32K–£80K/yr | 18–28% | £138K–£240K |
| Singapore | S$130K–S$185K | S$38K–S$95K/yr | 18–28% | S$175K–S$290K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Citigroup coordinate complex technology programs that span the bank's global operations across 160+ countries. TPMs at Citi (SVP or Director titles) manage programs that include global platform migrations, regulatory technology implementations, cross-border payment system modernization, and enterprise-wide infrastructure upgrades. The global scope adds layers of complexity that are unmatched at most technology companies: coordinating across time zones, regulatory jurisdictions, local technology environments, and culturally diverse teams.

Compensation follows the banking model: base plus discretionary bonus (18-28% at SVP, 25-40% at Director) plus deferred compensation. TPM compensation at Citi is aligned with senior engineering and PM bands. TPMs often manage programs with budgets of $50M-$500M+ and must coordinate delivery across multiple divisions, geographies, and vendor partners.

Competition comes from Big Tech (Google, Amazon, Meta), consulting firms, and other banks. Citi's global scale provides TPM experience that is difficult to replicate elsewhere.

**Level Mapping:** TPM at Citi (SVP/Director) = L5-L6 TPM at Google, E5-E6 TPM at Meta, Sr TPM-Principal TPM at Amazon, Director TPM at Capital One, SVP/ED at JPMorgan

**The Global Banking Program Premium**

Program management at Citi involves navigating regulatory approval processes across dozens of jurisdictions, coordinating with local technology teams and business stakeholders, managing multi-vendor delivery with complex contractual frameworks, and ensuring audit-ready documentation for global regulatory examinations. The complexity of global banking programs -- where a single platform change may require regulatory approval in 20+ countries -- justifies premium compensation for experienced TPMs.

Citi's transformation program has created sustained demand for TPMs who can drive change at global scale. The bank is simultaneously executing technology modernization, regulatory remediation, and business transformation programs, each requiring sophisticated program management across multiple geographies and divisions.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Amazon/JPMorgan] at $[X] total comp for a TPM role. I'm interested in Citi's global programs, but the total comp gap needs to be addressed. Can we increase the base to $[target]?"
2. **Global Program Scope:** "Managing programs across 160+ countries with multi-jurisdiction regulatory requirements is the most complex TPM role in the industry. This scope warrants Director-level compensation."
3. **Regulated Delivery Expertise:** "My experience delivering technology programs in [regulated/global/banking] environments is essential and scarce. This expertise commands $[X] at competitors."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[40K-65K] would bridge the transition."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about driving global programs at Citi. I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Citi, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $50K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
