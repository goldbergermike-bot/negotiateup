### Senior Software Engineer | Citigroup Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $130B market cap global bank + Engineering across consumer, institutional, and treasury + NYC HQ competitive hiring + Traditional bonus culture | Citi senior SWEs build global-scale banking platforms | **GLOBAL PLATFORM PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| New York City (HQ) | $148K–$195K | $42K–$100K/yr | 18–25% | $198K–$305K |
| London | £100K–£140K | £30K–£70K/yr | 18–25% | £135K–£215K |
| Singapore | S$130K–S$180K | S$35K–S$85K/yr | 18–25% | S$175K–S$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Citigroup (VP Technology title) build and maintain the core systems powering one of the world's most globally distributed banks. The engineering challenge at Citi is unique: systems must handle multi-currency transactions, comply with regulations across 160+ countries, integrate with local payment networks, and maintain 24/7 availability across global time zones. The tech stack is primarily Java, Python, and React, with increasing cloud adoption and modernization of legacy COBOL/mainframe systems.

Compensation follows the banking model: base plus discretionary bonus (18-25% at VP) plus deferred compensation. Citi's technology transformation has driven compensation increases for senior engineers, particularly those with cloud migration, distributed systems, or full-stack expertise. The bank operates major tech hubs in NYC, London, Singapore, Dublin, and Pune, providing geographic flexibility. NYC-based roles compete directly with Big Tech packages.

Competition comes from Big Tech, fintech, other banks, and hedge funds. Citi's global engineering challenges and multi-hub presence are differentiators for candidates who value international exposure and global impact.

**The Global Banking Engineering Premium**

Senior engineers at Citi work on systems with unique global complexity. A payment processing system, for example, must handle transactions in 100+ currencies, comply with local payment regulations in each country, integrate with regional payment networks (SEPA, SWIFT, local ACH equivalents), and maintain audit trails that satisfy regulators in every jurisdiction. This global complexity creates engineering challenges that are fundamentally more demanding than single-market systems.

Citi's technology modernization has created strong demand for senior engineers who can bridge legacy systems with modern cloud architectures. Engineers who can work across the full stack while understanding financial domain concepts (settlement, clearing, risk, compliance) are scarce and command premium packages. The bank's multi-hub model also means that senior engineers in lower-cost locations (Dublin, Pune) can earn competitive packages with exceptional purchasing power.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Capital One/Amazon] at $[X] total comp. I'm interested in Citi's global engineering challenges, but the comp gap needs to be addressed. Can we increase the base to $[target]?"
2. **Global Systems Expertise:** "My experience building [multi-region/multi-currency/globally distributed] systems is directly applicable to Citi's engineering challenges. This expertise commands $[X] at tech companies."
3. **Modernization Skills:** "My background in [cloud migration/microservices/API modernization] is exactly what Citi's transformation requires. This skillset justifies a base of $[target]."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested equity. A sign-on of $[35K-60K] would offset the forfeiture."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about Citi's global engineering challenges. I have a competing offer from [Capital One/Google] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Citi, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+3]%, and a sign-on of $45K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
