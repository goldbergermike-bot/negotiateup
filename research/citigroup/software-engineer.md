**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Citigroup (AVP or VP titles) form the foundation of the bank's global technology workforce. At the SWE level, engineers work across consumer banking applications, institutional trading platforms, treasury and trade solutions, and enterprise infrastructure. Citi's global footprint provides early-career engineers with exposure to international banking technology that is unavailable at most tech companies. The bank offers structured development programs with rotational opportunities across divisions and geographies.

Compensation is base plus annual discretionary bonus (15-20% at AVP, 18-25% at VP) plus deferred compensation. While NYC-based SWE compensation at Citi may trail Big Tech by 15-25%, the bank offers competitive packages in other locations and strong total comp when benefits, pension contributions, and deferred compensation are included. Citi also offers meaningful signing bonuses for competitive candidates.

Competition comes from Big Tech, fintech, and other banks. Citi's differentiator is the global exposure and career development opportunities: SWEs can move between NYC, London, Singapore, and other hubs, gaining international experience that accelerates career growth.

**Level Mapping:** SWE at Citi (AVP/VP) = L3-L4 at Google, E3-E4 at Meta, SDE I-II at Amazon, Mid at Capital One, Analyst/Associate at JPMorgan

**The Global Career Development Premium**

While Citi's initial SWE compensation may not match top-of-market tech companies, the bank offers unique career acceleration opportunities. SWEs can rotate across divisions (consumer, institutional, treasury) and geographies (NYC, London, Singapore, Dublin), building a breadth of experience that is rare at tech companies. The global mobility program allows engineers to relocate to international offices, gaining experience that commands premium compensation later in their careers.

Citi's technology transformation also means that SWEs joining now will gain experience in large-scale modernization -- migrating legacy systems to cloud, implementing modern engineering practices at global scale -- that is highly valued by future employers. The promotion path from AVP to VP typically takes 2-3 years and comes with 25-35% total comp increases.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Capital One/Amazon/Google] at $[X] total comp. I'm interested in Citi's global platform, but the base salary gap needs to be addressed. Can we increase the base to $[target]?"
2. **Technical Expertise:** "My experience with [cloud-native/distributed systems/modern stack] is directly applicable to Citi's transformation. This justifies a base of $[target]."
3. **Market Rate:** "The market rate for SWEs with my experience in NYC is $[target] base. I'd like the offer to reflect competitive market rates."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A sign-on bonus of $[20K-35K] would help close the year-one compensation gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about Citi's global engineering platform. I have a competing offer from [Capital One/Amazon] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Citi, I'd need the base at $[X+10K], guaranteed first-year bonus, and a sign-on of $25K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to go with the alternative."
