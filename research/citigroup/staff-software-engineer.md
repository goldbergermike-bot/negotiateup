**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Citigroup (SVP or Director Technology titles) are the technical leaders who drive engineering strategy across the bank's global technology organization. Staff SWEs at Citi set technical standards, lead complex system designs, and represent engineering in cross-functional leadership forums -- all at a global scale that spans 160+ countries. These engineers are expected to have organization-wide influence, mentor engineers across geographies, and lead the most critical modernization and platform migration projects.

Compensation includes base salary, discretionary bonus (20-32% at SVP, 28-45% at Director), and significant deferred compensation. Staff SWEs are among the highest-compensated individual contributors at Citi, with total comp that approaches or matches engineering manager pay. The bank has strengthened the IC career track to retain top technical talent, with clear progression from SVP to Director to Managing Director.

Competition comes from Big Tech (Google, Meta), hedge funds (Two Sigma, Citadel), and other banks (Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan). Citi's global scale and the complexity of its engineering challenges are differentiators for staff-level engineers who want to solve problems at truly global scope.

**Level Mapping:** Staff SWE at Citi (SVP/Director) = L6 at Google, E6 at Meta, Principal at Amazon, Principal Engineer at Capital One, SVP/ED at JPMorgan

**The Global Technical Leadership Premium**

Staff Engineers at Citi operate at a level of technical leadership that carries unique complexity. Their architecture decisions must account for regulatory compliance across 160+ countries, operational resilience requirements, and the bank's global risk appetite. A Staff SWE designing a new global payment system must ensure it satisfies regulations in dozens of jurisdictions, handles disaster recovery across continents, and integrates with legacy systems spanning decades of technology evolution. This expanded scope justifies premium compensation.

Citi's IC track provides a credible path to Managing Director for individual contributors. Staff SWEs at the Director level can achieve total compensation of $400K+, with MDs earning significantly more. Candidates should negotiate for Director-level title and compensation when their experience warrants it.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Goldman Sachs/Meta] at $[X] total comp for a Staff/L6 role. I'm drawn to Citi's global engineering challenges, but the total comp gap is significant. Can we close it with Director-level compensation?"
2. **Global Technical Impact:** "As Staff SWE, I'd set technical direction for engineering teams across [X] countries. This global influence warrants Director-level compensation with a base of $[target]."
3. **Platform Strategy:** "My technical leadership on [global platforms/modernization programs] would directly impact Citi's ability to compete globally. This strategic value justifies above-band compensation."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested equity. A sign-on of $[50K-90K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about driving technical strategy at Citi's global scale. I have a competing offer from [Google/Goldman Sachs] at $[W]K total comp. To choose Citi, I'd need the base at $[X+20K], Director-level bonus target of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $75K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], the competing offer becomes the clear choice."
