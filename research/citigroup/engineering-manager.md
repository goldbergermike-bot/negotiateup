### Engineering Manager | Citigroup Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $130B market cap global bank + Managing engineering across 160+ countries + NYC HQ competitive hiring + Banking management bonus culture | Citi EMs lead truly global engineering teams | **GLOBAL LEADERSHIP PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| New York City (HQ) | $170K–$235K | $58K–$145K/yr | 20–35% | $240K–$395K |
| London | £115K–£170K | £42K–£105K/yr | 20–35% | £165K–£285K |
| Singapore | S$155K–S$215K | S$50K–S$125K/yr | 20–35% | S$215K–S$350K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Citigroup lead technology teams across one of the world's most globally distributed banks. EMs at Citi (SVP or Director titles) manage teams of 8-30+ engineers spanning multiple geographic locations, navigating time zones, cultural differences, and jurisdiction-specific regulatory requirements. The EM role at Citi requires exceptional coordination skills alongside technical depth, as managers must ensure their teams deliver complex banking technology programs while maintaining regulatory compliance across all operating jurisdictions.

Compensation is heavily bonus-weighted in banking tradition: base plus discretionary bonus (20-35% at SVP, 30-50%+ at Director) plus deferred compensation. EMs in the Institutional Clients Group (markets, banking technology) typically earn higher bonuses than those in consumer technology, reflecting the revenue profile of each division. Citi also offers management-tier benefits including supplemental retirement, enhanced healthcare, and executive development programs.

Competition for EM talent comes from Big Tech (Google, Meta, Amazon), other global banks (JPMorgan, HSBC, Goldman Sachs), and fintech companies. Citi's unique selling point for EMs is the truly global scope: managing teams across NYC, London, Singapore, Dublin, and other hubs provides leadership experience that is rare in the industry.

**The Global Banking Leadership Premium**

Engineering management at Citi is more complex than at most technology companies. EMs must manage distributed global teams, navigate regulatory governance structures, coordinate with business stakeholders across divisions, and ensure compliance with jurisdiction-specific requirements. Citi's transformation under CEO Jane Fraser has also placed additional demands on EMs: they must modernize legacy systems, reduce technical debt, improve engineering velocity, and build a modern engineering culture -- all simultaneously.

Citi's regulatory environment adds a layer of accountability that tech company EMs rarely face. Engineering Managers are personally accountable for the quality, security, and audit-readiness of their teams' output, with regulatory examiners able to directly question management decisions. This expanded scope of responsibility justifies premium compensation. Candidates who can demonstrate experience managing large distributed teams, leading technology transformation programs, and operating in regulated environments have significant negotiation leverage.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/JPMorgan/Goldman Sachs] at $[X] total comp for an EM role. I'm drawn to Citi's global scope, but the total comp gap is significant. Can we close it with a base of $[target] and guaranteed bonus?"
2. **Global Team Leadership:** "Managing engineering teams across [X] countries and [Y] time zones is significantly more complex than a single-location EM role. This global scope warrants Director-level compensation."
3. **Transformation Track Record:** "I've led technology transformations at [previous companies], reducing technical debt by [X]%, improving deployment frequency by [Y]x, and achieving [Z]% retention. This track record justifies an above-band package."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[50K-90K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about leading global engineering teams at Citi. I have a competing offer from [Google/JPMorgan] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Citi, I'd need the base at $[X+20K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $70K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
