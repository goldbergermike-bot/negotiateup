**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Citigroup design the technical architecture for banking platforms that operate across 160+ countries. The SA role at Citi spans consumer banking, institutional trading, treasury services, and enterprise infrastructure, requiring architects who can design solutions that accommodate multi-jurisdiction regulatory requirements, cross-border data transfer restrictions, and local market integration needs. This global scope makes Citi architecture roles uniquely complex and valuable.

SAs hold SVP or Director titles with compensation as base plus discretionary bonus (18-28% at SVP, 25-40% at Director) plus deferred compensation. Architecture roles are compensated at or above senior engineering levels, reflecting the breadth of technical knowledge, business domain expertise, and stakeholder management required. Citi's architecture organization plays a central role in the bank's technology transformation program.

Competition comes from cloud providers, consulting firms, and other global banks. Citi's unmatched global scale provides architecture experience that is valued across industries.

**Level Mapping:** Solutions Architect at Citi (SVP/Director) = L5-L6 at Google, E5-E6 at Meta, Principal SA at Amazon, Principal Architect at Capital One, SVP/ED at JPMorgan

**The Global Banking Architecture Premium**

Architecture at Citi must account for regulatory requirements across 160+ countries, disaster recovery across global regions, data residency restrictions, and integration with local payment and banking infrastructure. A payment architecture at Citi, for example, must accommodate SWIFT, SEPA, local ACH systems, and real-time payment networks -- each with different protocols, security requirements, and regulatory frameworks. This global complexity creates architecture challenges that justify premium compensation.

Citi's transformation program has elevated architecture to a strategic function, with architects influencing technology investment decisions worth hundreds of millions of dollars. SAs who can design migration paths from legacy to cloud while maintaining global operations are exceptionally scarce and command above-band packages.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [AWS/JPMorgan/Google Cloud] at $[X] total comp for an architecture role. I'm drawn to Citi's global scale, but the compensation gap needs to be addressed. Can we increase the base to $[target]?"
2. **Global Architecture Expertise:** "My experience designing [global/multi-region/multi-jurisdiction] architectures is directly applicable to Citi and extremely scarce. This justifies a base of $[target]."
3. **Investment Influence:** "As Solutions Architect, my decisions will influence technology investments worth $[X]M+ across global operations. This scope warrants Director-level compensation."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have $[X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on of $[45K-75K] would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base with a [Y]% bonus target. I'm excited about architecting Citi's global platforms. I have a competing offer from [AWS/JPMorgan] at $[Z]K total comp. To choose Citi, I'd need the base at $[X+15K], guaranteed first-year bonus of [Y+5]%, and a sign-on of $60K. That brings first-year comp to approximately $[target]. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
