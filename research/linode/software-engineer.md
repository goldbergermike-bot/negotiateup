### Software Engineer — Linode (Akamai Cloud) Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Software Engineers at Linode (now Akamai Cloud Computing) build the cloud infrastructure platform that extends Akamai's edge network with full cloud computing capabilities — compute, storage, Kubernetes, and databases distributed across Akamai's global edge network.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Philadelphia (USD) | Remote US (USD) | Cambridge MA (USD) |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $143,000–$198,000 | $130,000–$185,000 | $148,000–$205,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $195,000–$258,000 | $180,000–$243,000 | $200,000–$265,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $250,000–$323,000 | $235,000–$305,000 | $258,000–$333,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, Akamai RSU grants (AKAM stock, 4-year vest), and performance bonus (typically 10%). Linode was acquired by Akamai in 2022. Engineers receive AKAM RSUs with full public market liquidity.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Linode/Akamai

Linode was acquired by Akamai for $900 million in 2022, creating Akamai Connected Cloud — a distributed cloud computing platform that combines Linode's cloud infrastructure with Akamai's massive global edge network (over 4,000 locations). Linode's Philadelphia-based engineering team builds the compute, storage, Kubernetes, and database services, while Akamai distributes these capabilities across its global network.

Software Engineers at Linode work on cloud infrastructure — hypervisor management, network virtualization, storage systems, and the control plane — with the unique advantage of deploying across Akamai's distributed edge infrastructure. This creates engineering challenges that combine traditional cloud computing with edge computing at global scale.

Under Akamai ownership, Linode engineers benefit from Akamai's enterprise resources, AKAM stock liquidity, and the strategic mission of building a distributed alternative to centralized hyperscaler clouds.

#### Linode/Akamai Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3 | Software Engineer | 1–3 years |
| L4 | Software Engineer II | 3–5 years |
| L5 | Senior Software Engineer | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff Software Engineer | 8–12 years |
| L7 | Principal Software Engineer | 12+ years |

#### Lever 1: Distributed Cloud Architecture

"Akamai Connected Cloud distributes compute across 4,000+ edge locations. I build cloud infrastructure for this uniquely distributed architecture — a challenge no other cloud provider faces at this scale."

#### Lever 2: Akamai Edge Network Integration

"Integrating Linode's cloud services with Akamai's edge network creates a differentiated cloud platform. My experience bridging cloud and edge computing accelerates this strategic integration."

#### Lever 3: AKAM Equity

"Akamai (AKAM) provides public-company RSU liquidity. I expect a competitive RSU grant reflecting my infrastructure engineering contributions."

#### Lever 4: Hyperscaler Alternative

"Akamai Connected Cloud positions as a distributed alternative to AWS/Azure/GCP. I build the cloud platform that enables this differentiation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $160,000 base with AKAM RSUs valued at $40K-$60K/year. Accept-at floor: $205,000 total comp. Cite distributed cloud architecture expertise.
