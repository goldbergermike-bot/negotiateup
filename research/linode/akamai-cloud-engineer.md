### Akamai Cloud Engineer — Linode (Akamai Cloud) Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Akamai Cloud Engineers at Linode build the distributed cloud computing platform that combines Linode's cloud infrastructure with Akamai's massive global edge network — creating a uniquely distributed cloud alternative to centralized hyperscalers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Philadelphia (USD) | Remote US (USD) | Cambridge MA (USD) |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $148,000–$205,000 | $133,000–$190,000 | $153,000–$210,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $200,000–$265,000 | $185,000–$248,000 | $208,000–$273,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $258,000–$333,000 | $243,000–$313,000 | $265,000–$343,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, AKAM RSUs (4-year vest), and performance bonus (10%). Akamai Cloud Engineer roles command a 3-5% premium over general SWE due to specialized distributed cloud and edge computing expertise.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Linode/Akamai

This is the signature engineering role at Linode/Akamai Cloud. Akamai Cloud Engineers build the platform that distributes cloud computing capabilities — compute instances, Kubernetes clusters, managed databases, object storage — across Akamai's network of 4,000+ locations in 130+ countries. This is fundamentally different from centralized cloud architectures and creates unique engineering challenges in distributed systems, edge computing, and global-scale orchestration.

Linode was founded in Philadelphia in 2003 and acquired by Akamai for $900 million in 2022. The Akamai Connected Cloud vision transforms Akamai from a CDN and security company into a distributed cloud computing platform. Akamai Cloud Engineers are building this new platform, combining Linode's proven cloud infrastructure with Akamai's global distribution capabilities.

The role requires expertise in cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, and edge computing — a combination that is uniquely rare and directly tied to Akamai's strategic differentiation.

#### Linode/Akamai Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YoE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L3 | Akamai Cloud Engineer | 1–3 years |
| L4 | Akamai Cloud Engineer II | 3–5 years |
| L5 | Senior Akamai Cloud Engineer | 5–8 years |
| L6 | Staff Akamai Cloud Engineer | 8–12 years |
| L7 | Principal Akamai Cloud Engineer | 12+ years |

#### Lever 1: Distributed Cloud Infrastructure

"Akamai Connected Cloud distributes compute across 4,000+ locations — a fundamentally different architecture than centralized hyperscalers. I bring experience building distributed cloud infrastructure that operates reliably at global scale."

#### Lever 2: Edge-Cloud Convergence

"The convergence of edge and cloud computing is Akamai's strategic vision. I build the infrastructure that seamlessly extends cloud capabilities to the edge, enabling use cases like edge databases, distributed Kubernetes, and local compute."

#### Lever 3: Hyperscaler Alternative Architecture

"Akamai Cloud is positioned as a distributed alternative to AWS, Azure, and GCP. I architect the platform capabilities — compute, networking, storage, K8s — that make this alternative compelling for developers."

#### Lever 4: Linode Legacy + Akamai Scale

"I bring the developer-friendly cloud infrastructure expertise from the Linode tradition, combined with the ability to operate at Akamai's global scale. This combination drives the platform's evolution."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $163,000 base with AKAM RSUs valued at $45K-$65K/year. Accept-at floor: $213,000 total comp. Cite distributed cloud expertise and the unique edge-cloud convergence opportunity.
