### DevOps Engineer | Domo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Small-Cap Public ($700M Market Cap) | BI Platform | Utah-Based Value | Smaller Company Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| American Fork UT HQ | $115K–$155K | $25K–$80K | 10% | $130K–$205K |
| Remote US | $110K–$145K | $20K–$70K | 10% | $125K–$195K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Domo manage the cloud infrastructure for a cloud-native BI platform. Domo was built cloud-native from the start (unlike Tableau's desktop-first origins), meaning the infrastructure is modern but must handle enterprise-scale data processing, real-time dashboards, and 1,000+ data connectors. At Domo's scale, DevOps engineers wear multiple hats — managing infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring, and cost optimization. The smaller team means higher per-engineer impact.

**Level Mapping:** Domo Senior DevOps = Sisense DevOps = Looker DevOps = New Relic DevOps (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **Cloud-Native from Day One:** "Domo was built cloud-native from the start. I'm not migrating legacy infrastructure — I'm optimizing and scaling a modern cloud architecture."
2. **Multi-Hat Impact:** "At Domo's scale, I'm responsible for the full infrastructure stack — from CI/CD to production monitoring to cost optimization. This breadth is unusual."
3. **Cost Optimization = PE Metric:** Infrastructure cost efficiency directly impacts Domo's bottom line. Frame: "My cost optimization work directly improves gross margins, which investors value highly."
4. **Datadog/HashiCorp Counter:** Both pay higher for DevOps. Use the gap constructively.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $75K over 4 years. My infrastructure work directly impacts Domo's gross margins and platform reliability." Counter at $55K-$70K RSUs is acceptable for Domo.
