### BI Platform Engineer | Domo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Small-Cap Public ($700M Market Cap) | BI Platform | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | Utah-Based Value

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| American Fork UT HQ | $120K–$170K | $30K–$90K | 10% | $140K–$220K |
| Remote US | $115K–$160K | $25K–$80K | 10% | $135K–$210K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Domo's signature engineering role. BI Platform Engineers build the core Domo platform — a cloud-native business intelligence system that integrates data, visualization, collaboration, and app-building in a single platform. Domo is a smaller public company (~$700M market cap) headquartered in American Fork, Utah. The company competes against much larger players (Tableau/Salesforce, Power BI/Microsoft, Looker/Google) but differentiates through its all-in-one cloud-native platform and strong mid-market focus. Domo's smaller size means each engineer has outsized impact, but comp is calibrated lower than Bay Area competitors. Utah's lower cost of living partially offsets the comp gap.

**Level Mapping:** Domo BI Platform Eng (Senior) = Tableau SWE = Looker SWE = Sisense SWE

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The BI Platform Engineer works across Domo's unified cloud-native platform:
- **Data Integration:** 1,000+ pre-built connectors and real-time data pipelines
- **Visualization Engine:** Interactive dashboards and chart rendering at scale
- **Domo Apps:** Low-code app builder on top of the BI platform
- **Domo AI:** AI-powered analytics features and data storytelling
- **Collaboration Layer:** Built-in social and collaboration features for data teams

**Global Levers**

1. **All-in-One Platform Ownership:** "Domo is a single integrated platform covering what competitors split across 3-4 products (data integration, visualization, collaboration, app building). I'm building the full stack, not just one piece."
2. **Small Company, Big Impact:** "At Domo's scale, my engineering work has disproportionate impact. Every feature I build serves the entire customer base — there's no hiding behind a large engineering org."
3. **Utah Cost Advantage:** "Utah's cost of living is 40-50% lower than the Bay Area. My salary goes further here, but I still expect market-rate comp for my skills, not a cost-of-living discount."
4. **Tableau/Looker Counter:** Both pay significantly higher with liquid equity. Use selectively: "I prefer Domo's culture and impact, but the comp gap with Tableau/Salesforce is significant."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $210K total comp with RSUs at $85K over 4 years. I'm building the core BI platform at a company where each engineer has outsized impact. I have a Tableau/Salesforce offer with significantly higher liquid RSUs." Counter at $65K-$80K RSUs is competitive for Domo's scale.
