### Software Engineer | Domo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Small-Cap Public ($700M Market Cap) | BI Platform | Utah-Based Value | Smaller Company Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| American Fork UT HQ | $110K–$155K | $25K–$80K | 10% | $130K–$205K |
| Remote US | $105K–$145K | $20K–$70K | 10% | $125K–$195K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Domo is a smaller public BI company (NASDAQ: DOMO, ~$700M market cap) headquartered in American Fork, Utah. SWEs build the cloud-native BI platform that competes with Tableau, Power BI, and Looker. Domo's smaller scale means each engineer has outsized impact — you'll work across more of the stack and ship features faster than at a large company. Comp is calibrated below Bay Area standards but competitive for Utah. RSU grants are smaller in absolute terms but the stock's low market cap creates potential upside if Domo grows or is acquired. The 10% cash bonus provides stability. [Source: Domo SWE Comp Data 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Domo SWE = Sisense SWE = Looker SWE (entry) = Google L3 (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **Outsized Impact:** "At Domo's scale, I'll work across more of the stack and ship features that serve the entire customer base. My impact per-engineer is 3-5x what it would be at Salesforce."
2. **Acquisition Upside:** "Domo's $700M market cap makes it an acquisition target. A strategic acquisition by a larger company (Microsoft, Salesforce, Google) could create significant equity upside."
3. **Utah Quality of Life:** While not a direct comp lever, Utah's quality of life (outdoor recreation, lower cost of living) is a retention factor. Don't use this to accept lower comp — use it as a reason you WANT to be at Domo while still pushing for fair pay.
4. **Tableau/Power BI Counter:** Use selectively: "Tableau/Salesforce is offering $185K+ total comp. I prefer Domo's culture and scope, but I need the comp gap to be reasonable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $75K over 4 years. I want to be at Domo for the impact and culture, but I need the comp to be within striking distance of larger competitors." Counter at $55K-$70K RSUs is acceptable for Domo.
