### Technical Program Manager | Domo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Small-Cap Public ($700M Market Cap) | BI Platform | Utah-Based Value | Smaller Company Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| American Fork UT HQ | $120K–$165K | $30K–$85K | 10% | $140K–$220K |
| Remote US | $115K–$155K | $25K–$75K | 10% | $135K–$210K |

**Negotiation DNA**

TPMs at Domo coordinate cross-functional programs across a small but high-output engineering organization. At Domo's scale, TPMs have extraordinary breadth — each TPM's programs may touch 40-60% of the engineering org. Key programs include platform releases, AI feature launches, enterprise security compliance, and infrastructure optimization. The small team means TPMs must be hands-on and technically proficient.

**Level Mapping:** Domo Senior TPM = Sisense Senior TPM = Looker TPM (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **Extraordinary Organizational Breadth:** "My programs touch 40-60% of Domo's engineering org. At Salesforce, a TPM at my level would coordinate one workstream within one team."
2. **Resource Efficiency Programs:** "Managing programs at a company competing against 10-50x larger competitors requires exceptional prioritization and execution."
3. **Enterprise Compliance Programs:** If managing SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA compliance, frame as revenue enabler: "Enterprise compliance programs directly unlock regulated customer segments."
4. **Google/Salesforce TPM Counter:** Use the scope argument to justify closing the comp gap.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $80K over 4 years. My programs span the majority of Domo's engineering org — a scope impossible at larger companies." Counter at $60K-$75K RSUs is competitive for Domo.
