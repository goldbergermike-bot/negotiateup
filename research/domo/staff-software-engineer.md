**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Engineers at Domo are the company's top technical leaders. At a ~$700M market cap company, Staff Engineers are effectively CTO-level technical architects for their domain — there may only be a handful across the entire engineering org. This level of technical influence is exceptional but comes with lower absolute comp than Staff roles at FAANG or large-cap companies. The equity upside at Staff level is meaningful if Domo grows or gets acquired — Staff grants are large enough to benefit materially from an exit event. [Source: Domo Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Domo Staff SWE = Sisense Staff SWE = Google L5 (comp-adjusted) = Salesforce Principal MTS (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **CTO-Level Technical Scope:** "At Domo's scale, I'm the Staff-level architect for an entire platform domain. This is CTO-adjacent technical scope that's impossible to achieve at a company 10x Domo's size."
2. **Exit Event Equity:** "At Staff level, my equity grant is meaningful enough that an acquisition or growth event would be material. I want a grant that maximizes this upside."
3. **Retention Criticality:** "At Domo's scale, losing a Staff engineer has disproportionate impact. There may be only 2-3 people in the company who understand this domain at my level."
4. **Google/Salesforce Staff Counter:** The comp gap at Staff level is significant. Be direct: "I have a Google L5 offer at $500K+ TC. I want to be at Domo for the scope, but the gap needs to be within reason."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $160K over 4 years. At Staff level at Domo, I have CTO-adjacent scope. The comp gap with larger companies is real, but I need Domo to push to the top of band." Counter at $130K-$155K RSUs is competitive for Domo.
