### Data Scientist | Domo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Small-Cap Public ($700M Market Cap) | BI Platform | Utah-Based Value | Smaller Company Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| American Fork UT HQ | $120K–$165K | $30K–$90K | 10% | $140K–$220K |
| Remote US | $115K–$155K | $25K–$80K | 10% | $135K–$210K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Domo build the AI and analytics intelligence features within the BI platform. This includes Domo AI (AI-powered insights, data storytelling, anomaly detection), predictive analytics tools, and the machine learning capabilities that help business users extract insights from their data. At Domo's scale, the DS team is small, meaning each data scientist has broad product impact. [Source: Domo DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Domo Senior DS = Sisense DS = Looker DS = Tableau DS (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **Product AI Features:** "At Domo, data science IS product functionality. My Domo AI features directly improve the product's competitive position against Tableau and Power BI."
2. **Small Team, Full-Stack DS:** "Domo's DS team is small enough that I work across the full stack — from model training to production deployment to UX integration. This breadth is rare."
3. **AI Competitive Necessity:** "Tableau, Power BI, and Looker are all adding AI features backed by Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google resources. Domo needs strong DS talent to compete."
4. **Google/Salesforce DS Counter:** The comp gap is real. Frame carefully: "I need Domo to be within reasonable distance of larger-company DS offers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $85K over 4 years. My AI features are core to Domo's competitive positioning against Tableau, Power BI, and Looker." Counter at $65K-$80K RSUs is competitive for Domo.
