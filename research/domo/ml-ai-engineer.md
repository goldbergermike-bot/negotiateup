### ML / AI Engineer | Domo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Small-Cap Public ($700M Market Cap) | BI Platform | Utah-Based Value | AI Competitive Necessity

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| American Fork UT HQ | $125K–$170K | $30K–$95K | 10% | $145K–$230K |
| Remote US | $120K–$160K | $25K–$85K | 10% | $140K–$220K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Domo build the AI features that keep the platform competitive against Tableau (Einstein AI), Power BI (Copilot), and Looker (Gemini). Domo AI includes AI-powered insights, natural language querying, anomaly detection, and data storytelling. At Domo's scale, the ML/AI team is very small, meaning each engineer owns a disproportionate share of the AI feature set. This is an existential competitive challenge — without strong AI features, Domo risks falling behind competitors with massive AI R&D budgets. [Source: Domo ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Domo ML/AI Eng = Sisense ML Eng = Looker ML Eng = Tableau ML Eng (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **Competitive Survival AI:** "Domo AI features directly determine whether the platform remains competitive against Tableau (Salesforce Einstein), Power BI (Microsoft Copilot), and Looker (Google Gemini). My work is existentially important."
2. **Outsized AI Ownership:** "Domo's ML/AI team is small enough that I may own 25-50% of the AI feature set. This level of AI product ownership is impossible at a larger company."
3. **AI Talent Scarcity:** "ML/AI engineers are the most sought-after talent in tech. Domo needs to pay competitively to attract this talent to Utah, even with remote work."
4. **Google/Salesforce ML Counter:** The comp gap for AI talent is especially large. Push hard: "I have ML offers at $300K+ TC from larger companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $90K over 4 years. My AI work is existentially important to Domo's competitive position, and the AI talent market is extremely tight." Counter at $70K-$85K RSUs is the best Domo can do.
