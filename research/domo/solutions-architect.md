Solutions Architects at Domo design and deploy BI solutions for enterprise customers. Domo SAs help customers configure data connectors, build dashboards, design data models, and integrate Domo with their existing data ecosystem. At Domo's scale, SAs are highly customer-facing and directly impact customer retention and expansion. The 1,000+ connector ecosystem means SAs need broad data integration expertise.
