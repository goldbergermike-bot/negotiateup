**Negotiation DNA:** Small-Cap Public ($700M Market Cap) | BI Platform | Utah-Based Value | Smaller Company Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Domo design and deploy BI solutions for enterprise customers. Domo SAs help customers configure data connectors, build dashboards, design data models, and integrate Domo with their existing data ecosystem. At Domo's scale, SAs are highly customer-facing and directly impact customer retention and expansion. The 1,000+ connector ecosystem means SAs need broad data integration expertise.

**Level Mapping:** Domo Senior SA = Sisense SA = Looker SA = Tableau SA (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **Customer Retention Impact:** "At Domo's scale, each SA's customers represent a material share of ARR. My deployment quality directly impacts retention rates."
2. **Full-Platform Expertise:** "Domo is an all-in-one platform. I architect solutions spanning data integration, visualization, collaboration, and apps — not just one slice."
3. **Connector Ecosystem Expertise:** "My expertise across 1,000+ data connectors makes me a platform generalist with deep integration knowledge."
4. **Tableau/Snowflake SA Counter:** Both pay higher for SA roles. Use to push RSUs.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $75K over 4 years. My customer deployments directly impact retention and expansion revenue at Domo." Counter at $55K-$70K RSUs is acceptable for Domo.
