### Senior Software Engineer | Domo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Small-Cap Public ($700M Market Cap) | BI Platform | Utah-Based Value | Smaller Company Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| American Fork UT HQ | $135K–$180K | $40K–$110K | 10% | $160K–$245K |
| Remote US | $125K–$170K | $35K–$95K | 10% | $150K–$230K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at Domo own significant platform components in a smaller engineering organization. At Domo's scale, senior engineers are technical leaders with company-wide influence — you may be the primary expert on entire subsystems (data connectors, visualization engine, app framework). This breadth of ownership is rare at larger companies. The trade-off is lower absolute comp. Push hard on RSUs because Domo's small market cap means your equity upside is tied to whether the company grows significantly or gets acquired. [Source: Domo Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Domo Senior SWE = Sisense Senior SWE = Looker Senior SWE = Tableau SWE (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **Breadth of Ownership:** "At Domo's scale, I own entire subsystems that would be split among 3-5 senior engineers at Salesforce. This breadth of technical ownership justifies top-of-band comp."
2. **Acquisition Upside Play:** "Domo at $700M market cap is an acquisition candidate. A 2-3x premium acquisition would make my RSUs significantly more valuable."
3. **Tech Lead Responsibilities:** If functioning as a tech lead without the title, push for the title and comp: "I'm functioning as the technical lead for [subsystem]. The title and comp should match."
4. **Tableau/Databricks Counter:** Use carefully: "My Tableau/Salesforce offer is 30-40% higher in total comp. I prefer Domo's impact, but the gap needs to narrow."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $100K over 4 years. I'm the technical owner of [subsystem] at Domo, with breadth that's impossible at larger companies. I need the equity to partially close the gap with larger-company offers." Counter at $75K-$95K RSUs is strong for Domo.
