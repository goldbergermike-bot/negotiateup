### Product Designer | Domo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Small-Cap Public ($700M Market Cap) | BI Platform | Utah-Based Value | Smaller Company Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| American Fork UT HQ | $105K–$145K | $20K–$65K | 10% | $120K–$185K |
| Remote US | $100K–$140K | $18K–$60K | 10% | $115K–$175K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Domo design the BI experience that competes against Tableau's best-in-class visualizations and Power BI's Microsoft ecosystem integration. Domo's design differentiation is the all-in-one experience — data integration, visualization, collaboration, and app building in a single UI. The design team is small, giving each designer significant ownership across the product. The challenge is designing for both technical data teams and non-technical business users.

**Level Mapping:** Domo Senior Designer = Sisense Senior Designer = Looker Designer (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **Full-Product Design Ownership:** "At Domo's design team size, I own entire product surfaces. At Salesforce I'd own one feature within Tableau."
2. **Data Visualization UX:** "BI data visualization is one of the most mature and competitive UX domains. Tableau sets the standard — my designs need to match or exceed that."
3. **AI Interface Design:** If designing Domo AI features, push for AI premium: "Designing AI-powered analytics interfaces is a nascent discipline."
4. **Figma/Salesforce Counter:** Both offer significantly higher comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $60K over 4 years. I'm owning significant product surfaces at Domo, and my design work directly competes against Tableau's UX." Counter at $45K-$55K RSUs is competitive for Domo.
