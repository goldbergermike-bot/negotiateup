### Data Engineer | Domo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Small-Cap Public ($700M Market Cap) | BI Platform | Utah-Based Value | Smaller Company Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| American Fork UT HQ | $120K–$165K | $30K–$90K | 10% | $140K–$220K |
| Remote US | $115K–$155K | $25K–$80K | 10% | $135K–$210K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Domo build the data integration and pipeline infrastructure that powers the BI platform. Domo boasts 1,000+ pre-built data connectors, making data integration a core product capability (not just internal tooling). DEs build and maintain connectors, real-time data pipelines, data transformation workflows, and the data warehouse infrastructure. The meta-quality applies: you're a data engineer building a data platform for other data professionals. [Source: Domo DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Domo Senior DE = Sisense DE = Looker DE = Tableau DE (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **1,000+ Connector Ecosystem:** "Domo's 1,000+ data connectors are a core product differentiator. Each connector I build or maintain directly impacts the product's addressable market."
2. **Real-Time Pipeline Architecture:** If working on real-time data pipelines, push for premium: "Real-time BI data pipelines at enterprise scale require specialized expertise."
3. **Meta-Platform Frame:** "I'm a data engineer building a data platform for other data professionals. The engineering standard at Domo is inherently higher."
4. **Snowflake/Databricks DE Counter:** Both pay higher. Use selectively: "Snowflake/Databricks offers 40-50% higher comp for DE roles. I need Domo to close this gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $85K over 4 years. My data connector and pipeline work is core product functionality — not internal tooling." Counter at $65K-$80K RSUs is competitive for Domo.
