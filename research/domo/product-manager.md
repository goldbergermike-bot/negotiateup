### Product Manager | Domo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Small-Cap Public ($700M Market Cap) | BI Platform | Utah-Based Value | Smaller Company Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| American Fork UT HQ | $125K–$170K | $35K–$100K | 10-15% | $150K–$235K |
| Remote US | $120K–$160K | $30K–$90K | 10-15% | $145K–$220K |

**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at Domo own significant product domains on a platform competing against Tableau, Power BI, and Looker — all backed by companies with far larger PM organizations. This creates extraordinary PM scope: each Domo PM may own the roadmap for an area that has 5-10 PMs at Salesforce. The PM's ability to prioritize ruthlessly is critical when competing against companies with 10-50x the resources. Domo's integrated platform (data + visualization + collaboration + apps) means PM decisions span the full data experience. [Source: Domo PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Domo PM = Sisense PM = Looker PM = Tableau PM (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **Outsized Product Scope:** "My product scope at Domo is equivalent to 5-10 PMs at Salesforce. This breadth of product ownership is my primary compensation lever."
2. **Competitive Product Strategy:** "I'm defining product strategy against Tableau (Salesforce), Power BI (Microsoft), and Looker (Google). Winning against these players requires exceptional product judgment."
3. **AI Product Necessity:** If owning Domo AI, push for AI premium: "AI is existentially important for Domo's competitive position. My AI product decisions determine the platform's future."
4. **Salesforce/Google PM Counter:** The comp gap is real but the scope gap is also real. Leverage scope.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $95K over 4 years. I own product scope equivalent to 5-10 PMs at Salesforce, and I'm defining strategy against companies with orders of magnitude more resources." Counter at $70K-$85K RSUs is competitive for Domo.
