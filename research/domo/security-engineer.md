**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Domo protect a BI platform that processes sensitive enterprise data — financial reports, customer metrics, HR data, and strategic business intelligence. Domo connects to 1,000+ data sources, creating a large attack surface. Enterprise customers require SOC2, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance. At Domo's scale, the security team is small, meaning each security engineer owns a disproportionate share of the security surface. [Source: Domo Security Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Domo Senior Security Eng = Sisense Security Eng = Looker Security Eng (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **Broad Security Surface:** "Domo connects to 1,000+ data sources and processes sensitive enterprise data. The security surface is enormous, and I'm one of a small team covering it all."
2. **Compliance Revenue Enablement:** "SOC2, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance are revenue enablers. Without these certifications, Domo can't sell to regulated industries."
3. **AI Security Challenges:** If securing Domo AI features, push for AI security premium: "AI features introduce novel attack vectors — prompt injection, data leakage through AI queries."
4. **CrowdStrike/Palo Alto Counter:** Cybersecurity companies pay significantly more. Use carefully.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $85K over 4 years. I'm covering a broad security surface on a small team, and my compliance work directly enables enterprise revenue." Counter at $65K-$80K RSUs is competitive for Domo.
