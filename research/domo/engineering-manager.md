### Engineering Manager | Domo Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Small-Cap Public ($700M Market Cap) | BI Platform | Utah-Based Value | Smaller Company Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| American Fork UT HQ | $155K–$200K | $55K–$140K | 10-15% | $190K–$285K |
| Remote US | $145K–$190K | $45K–$120K | 10-15% | $175K–$265K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Domo lead teams building a BI platform that competes against Tableau, Power BI, and Looker — all backed by companies 10-50x Domo's size. This creates a unique EM challenge: delivering competitive features with a fraction of the engineering resources. EMs at Domo are expected to be technically strong and hands-on. The smaller org means EM decisions have disproportionate organizational impact — you may manage 20-30% of the engineers working on a critical product domain. [Source: Domo EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Domo EM = Sisense EM = Looker EM = Tableau EM (comp-adjusted)

**Global Levers**

1. **Resource Efficiency Leadership:** "I'm leading teams that compete against Salesforce (Tableau), Microsoft (Power BI), and Google (Looker) with a fraction of their resources. The management and technical bar is higher, not lower."
2. **Organizational Impact:** "At Domo's scale, my team may represent 20-30% of the engineers in a product domain. My management decisions have disproportionate organizational impact."
3. **IC Parity:** Senior/Staff ICs at Domo can earn $150K+ in RSUs. EMs must match: "My equity should be at least equal to the Staff ICs I manage."
4. **Salesforce/Google EM Counter:** The comp gap at EM level is significant. Be direct: "I need Domo to close the gap meaningfully."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like RSUs at $130K over 4 years. I'm leading teams that compete against companies with 10-50x our resources, and my management scope as a percentage of the org is exceptional." Counter at $100K-$125K RSUs is competitive for Domo.
