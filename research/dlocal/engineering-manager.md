### Engineering Manager — dLocal Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes dLocal's Asia Priority strategy, translating the Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot and Feb 11 JPM Bull Case into an engineering management compensation framework spanning Montevideo, São Paulo, and New York markets. Engineering Managers are the operational leaders who will build and scale the teams delivering dLocal's Asia expansion.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 2,500,000 - 3,800,000 | UYU 1,400,000 - 2,800,000 | UYU 3,900,000 - 6,600,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$350,000 - R$520,000 | R$200,000 - R$380,000 | R$550,000 - R$900,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $200,000 - $270,000 | $100,000 - $200,000 | $300,000 - $470,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering Managers at dLocal are being asked to do something uniquely challenging — build and scale engineering teams that can deliver payment integrations across Asia's fragmented markets while maintaining the existing LatAm platform. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot means EMs must recruit engineers with Asian payment method expertise, establish development processes for multi-timezone teams, and deliver against aggressive Asia launch timelines. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case prices in this execution, tying DLO equity directly to the EM's ability to build high-performing teams.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| EM I | Engineering Manager | Tech Lead Manager | EM 1 | Eng Manager |
| EM II | Senior EM | Engineering Director | EM 2 | Senior EM |
| Director | Director of Eng | VP Engineering | EM 3 | Director |

dLocal's Engineering Manager role carries broader organizational scope than equivalents at Ebanx, often managing cross-functional squads spanning backend, frontend, and infrastructure. With the Asia expansion, EMs will manage teams across Montevideo, São Paulo, and new Asian hubs — a multi-continental management scope that Mercado Pago would assign to an EM 2-3.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** transforms the Engineering Manager role from regional team leadership to global emerging market platform leadership. EMs must now build teams capable of integrating with India's UPI (2B+ monthly transactions), Southeast Asian payment schemes, and East Asian digital wallets — all while maintaining and improving the existing LatAm payment platform.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** update highlights "execution velocity" as a key differentiator in JP Morgan's bull thesis. Engineering Managers are directly accountable for execution velocity — they set sprint cadences, manage team capacity, remove blockers, and ensure Asia integration timelines are met. JPM's bull case price target is essentially a bet on EM-level execution.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** DNA means Engineering Managers already understand how to build teams that navigate regulatory complexity, currency volatility, and fragmented payment ecosystems. Transplanting this organizational playbook to Asia — where they must also navigate different engineering cultures, timezone spreads, and talent markets — is a step-change in management complexity.

For Engineering Managers specifically, the Asia expansion means managing distributed teams across 3+ continents, hiring engineers with Asian payment expertise in competitive talent markets (Bangalore, Jakarta, Singapore), and creating development workflows that maintain velocity across a 12+ hour timezone spread. This scope justifies Director-level compensation at peer companies.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Multi-Continental Team Scope**
> "I'll be managing engineering teams across Latin America and Asia — a 12+ hour timezone spread covering 10+ markets. This multi-continental management scope is equivalent to a Director of Engineering role at Ebanx or PagSeguro and should be compensated accordingly."

**Lever 2: Asia Hiring & Team Building Premium**
> "Building engineering teams for the Asia expansion requires hiring in competitive markets like Bangalore, Singapore, and Jakarta. My compensation should reflect the complexity of multi-market talent acquisition and the strategic importance of assembling the right team for dLocal's top priority."

**Lever 3: JPM Bull Case Execution Accountability**
> "JP Morgan's Feb 11 bull case depends on execution velocity — which is my direct responsibility. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect the stock price impact of successful Asia team delivery, with refresh grants tied to Asia market launch milestones."

**Lever 4: EM Payments Management Scarcity**
> "Engineering managers who have built teams for emerging market payment platforms — and can replicate that playbook in Asia — are extremely rare. My alternatives include Stripe, Adyen, and Mercado Pago management roles, all of which compensate at the ranges I'm requesting."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In New York, start at $260,000 base + $190,000 RSU/yr (4yr vest). Accept no lower than $210,000 base + $115,000 RSU/yr. In São Paulo, start at R$500,000 base + R$360,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than R$380,000 base + R$220,000 RSU/yr. In Montevideo, start at UYU 3,600,000 base + UYU 2,600,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than UYU 2,700,000 base + UYU 1,600,000 RSU/yr. Negotiate a management scope bonus tied to Asia team headcount growth and market launch milestones.
