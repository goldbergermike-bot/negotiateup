### Solutions Architect — dLocal Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes dLocal's Asia Priority strategy, translating the Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot and Feb 11 JPM Bull Case into a solutions architecture compensation framework spanning Montevideo, São Paulo, and New York markets. Solutions Architects at dLocal are the technical face of the platform to enterprise merchants expanding into Asian emerging markets — designing integration architectures that enable cross-border payments across the world's fastest-growing economies.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 2,400,000 - 3,600,000 | UYU 1,400,000 - 2,800,000 | UYU 3,800,000 - 6,400,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$340,000 - R$480,000 | R$200,000 - R$380,000 | R$540,000 - R$860,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $170,000 - $235,000 | $100,000 - $190,000 | $270,000 - $425,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Solutions Architects at dLocal are the technical bridge between dLocal's emerging market payment platform and enterprise merchants seeking to accept payments across Asia. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot means SAs must now design integration architectures that span both LatAm and Asian payment ecosystems — configuring payment routing, local payment method acceptance, and settlement flows across currencies like INR, IDR, THB, VND, and PHP alongside existing LatAm currencies. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case directly depends on merchant adoption in Asia, which is driven by the quality of solutions architecture. SAs who can design elegant, merchant-friendly integrations for Asia's fragmented payment landscape directly accelerate dLocal's revenue growth.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| SA | Solutions Architect | Integration Engineer | SA (L5) | Solutions Architect |
| Senior SA | Senior SA | Senior Integration | Senior SA (L6) | Senior SA |
| Principal SA | Principal / Director | Head of Integration | Principal SA (L7) | Lead SA |

dLocal SAs engage with higher-complexity integrations than Ebanx SAs due to the broader market coverage (40+ countries vs. Ebanx's primarily LatAm focus). With the Asia expansion, dLocal SAs must design integrations that handle multi-currency, multi-regulatory, and multi-continental complexity simultaneously — a scope that justifies Senior or Principal SA compensation.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** transforms the Solutions Architect role from LatAm integration specialist to global emerging market integration leader. SAs must now design merchant integrations that span both LatAm and Asian payment ecosystems — enabling a single merchant to accept UPI payments in India, GCash in the Philippines, PromptPay in Thailand, and PIX in Brazil through one dLocal integration. This "one integration, two continents" value proposition is dLocal's key competitive advantage, and SAs are the ones who make it real.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** update depends on merchant adoption velocity in Asia. Every enterprise merchant that dLocal onboards in Asia represents new TPV (Total Payment Volume) that feeds JPM's revenue model. Solutions Architects control merchant time-to-integration, integration quality, and merchant satisfaction — all of which directly affect adoption rates and therefore JPM's bull case price target.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** integration expertise — built through years of designing solutions for LatAm's complex payment landscape — is directly transferable to Asia. SAs who can design integrations that handle regulatory constraints, local payment method fragmentation, and FX complexity across both continents are uniquely valuable.

For Solutions Architects specifically, the Asia expansion means designing integration blueprints for Asian payment methods, creating merchant-facing documentation for Asian local payment schemes, building proof-of-concept integrations for Asia-entering merchants, and serving as the technical advisor for enterprise deals targeting Asian markets. This cross-continental SA scope warrants Principal-level compensation.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Cross-Continental Integration Architecture**
> "I design integration architectures that span LatAm and Asia — enabling merchants to accept local payment methods across 50+ emerging markets through a single integration. This cross-continental architecture scope is Principal SA territory and should be compensated accordingly."

**Lever 2: Merchant Revenue Attribution**
> "Every merchant I onboard and every integration I design translates directly to dLocal TPV. My technical relationships and integration quality directly determine the merchant adoption velocity that JP Morgan's Feb 11 bull case depends on. My RSU grant should reflect this revenue attribution."

**Lever 3: EM Integration Expertise Scarcity**
> "Solutions Architects who can design payment integrations across both LatAm and Asian emerging markets — handling regulatory constraints, local payment methods, and FX complexity — are extraordinarily scarce. This expertise commands a significant market premium."

**Lever 4: Enterprise Technical Relationship Value**
> "I serve as the technical advisor for enterprise merchants expanding into emerging markets. These relationships directly influence deal size, expansion revenue, and merchant retention. My compensation should reflect the revenue impact of these technical relationships."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In New York, start at $230,000 base + $180,000 RSU/yr (4yr vest). Accept no lower than $180,000 base + $110,000 RSU/yr. In São Paulo, start at R$460,000 base + R$360,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than R$360,000 base + R$220,000 RSU/yr. In Montevideo, start at UYU 3,500,000 base + UYU 2,700,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than UYU 2,600,000 base + UYU 1,600,000 RSU/yr. Negotiate travel budgets for Asia merchant engagements and RSU refresh grants tied to Asia merchant activation milestones.
