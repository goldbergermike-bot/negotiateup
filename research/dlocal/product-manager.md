#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 2,200,000 - 3,400,000 | UYU 1,200,000 - 2,400,000 | UYU 3,400,000 - 5,800,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$300,000 - R$460,000 | R$170,000 - R$320,000 | R$470,000 - R$780,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $170,000 - $240,000 | $85,000 - $170,000 | $255,000 - $410,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Managers at dLocal are the strategic minds translating the Asia expansion vision into executable product roadmaps. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot requires PMs who can prioritize which Asian payment methods to integrate first, define the merchant onboarding experience for Asian markets, and sequence product launches across India, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case upgrade reinforces that DLO's upside is directly tied to product strategy execution in Asia — making PM roadmap decisions high-stakes, equity-moving choices.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| PM I | Product Manager | Product Analyst | PM 1 | Assoc PM |
| PM II | Senior PM | Product Manager | PM 2 | PM |
| PM III | Lead PM / GPM | Senior PM | PM 3 | Senior PM |

dLocal PMs typically own broader product surface area than equivalents at Ebanx or PagSeguro, spanning payment acceptance, settlement, FX, and merchant experience for multiple markets. The Asia expansion further multiplies this scope — a dLocal PM II now owns product decisions across LatAm and Asian markets, a breadth that Mercado Pago would split across PM 2-3 levels.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** places Product Managers at the strategic center of dLocal's most important initiative. PMs must now research, prioritize, and roadmap payment method integrations across Asia's incredibly fragmented landscape — India alone has UPI, Paytm, PhonePe, and dozens of bank-specific payment methods. Southeast Asia adds GCash, GrabPay, OVO, DANA, PromptPay, and VNPay. PMs must decide which markets to enter first, which payment methods to prioritize, and how to adapt dLocal's merchant-facing product for Asian buyer behaviors.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** update is fundamentally a bet on product strategy. JPM's bull thesis assumes dLocal will successfully expand its TAM from $1.4T in LatAm cross-border payments to $3T+ by adding Asian corridors. Product Managers define which corridors to build, in what sequence, and with what merchant targeting — making PM decisions the key input to whether JPM's bull case materializes.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** positioning means PMs already have deep expertise in the unique product challenges of EM payments — managing regulatory restrictions, local payment method fragmentation, currency volatility, and merchant needs that differ dramatically from developed markets. This playbook is directly transferable to Asia, where many of the same dynamics exist at even greater scale.

For Product Managers specifically, the Asia expansion means owning a product portfolio that spans 20+ countries across two continents, managing product launches in markets with fundamentally different payment cultures, and building merchant-facing tools that serve both LatAm and Asian seller bases. This is a VP-level product scope compressed into a PM title.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Asia Roadmap Ownership**
> "I'll be defining dLocal's Asia product roadmap — deciding which markets, payment methods, and merchant segments to prioritize first. These product decisions directly determine whether the JPM bull case materializes. This strategic scope warrants Senior PM / GPM-level compensation."

**Lever 2: Multi-Continental Product Portfolio**
> "My product scope now spans LatAm and Asia — 20+ countries with distinct payment ecosystems, regulatory environments, and merchant needs. At Mercado Pago, this would be split across 3-4 PMs. My compensation should reflect the compressed scope I'm carrying."

**Lever 3: EM Payments Product Expertise Scarcity**
> "Product Managers who understand emerging market payment dynamics — fragmented methods, regulatory constraints, FX complexity — and can apply that expertise to new Asian markets are exceptionally rare. Stripe and Adyen are both hiring for this profile at senior levels."

**Lever 4: Revenue Impact Attribution**
> "Every payment method I prioritize and every market I launch in Asia directly translates to new TPV for dLocal. My RSU grant should be sized to reflect this revenue impact, with refresh grants tied to Asia TPV milestones."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In New York, start at $235,000 base + $165,000 RSU/yr (4yr vest). Accept no lower than $185,000 base + $100,000 RSU/yr. In São Paulo, start at R$440,000 base + R$300,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than R$330,000 base + R$190,000 RSU/yr.
