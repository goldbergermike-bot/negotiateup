### Data Engineer — dLocal Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes dLocal's Asia Priority strategy, translating the Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot and Feb 11 JPM Bull Case into a data engineering compensation framework spanning Montevideo, São Paulo, and New York markets. Data Engineers at dLocal build the data infrastructure that powers the emerging market payment platform — from real-time payment event pipelines to cross-continental analytics and compliance data flows.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 1,800,000 - 3,000,000 | UYU 1,000,000 - 2,200,000 | UYU 2,800,000 - 5,200,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$270,000 - R$400,000 | R$160,000 - R$320,000 | R$430,000 - R$720,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $155,000 - $215,000 | $85,000 - $165,000 | $240,000 - $380,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Engineers at dLocal build and maintain the data infrastructure that processes financial events across 40+ emerging markets in real time. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot dramatically increases data complexity — Asian payment methods generate event streams with different schemas, volumes, and latency characteristics than LatAm payment methods. UPI in India alone processes 10+ billion transactions per month, each generating events that must be ingested, transformed, and made available for real-time routing decisions and offline analytics. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case depends on dLocal's ability to process and analyze Asian payment data at scale — a core data engineering deliverable.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Data Eng | Data Engineer | Analytics Engineer | Data Eng (L4) | Data Engineer |
| Senior DE | Senior Data Eng | Senior Analytics | Senior DE (L5) | Senior DE |
| Staff DE | Staff / Lead DE | Lead Analytics | Staff DE (L6) | Lead DE |

dLocal's data engineering team manages data pipelines spanning more geographic markets and payment types than Ebanx or PagSeguro. The Asia expansion adds entirely new payment event schemas (UPI, QRIS, PromptPay) alongside new currencies and regulatory data requirements. This breadth justifies compensation at the top of market ranges.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** creates entirely new data engineering requirements. Asian payment methods generate high-volume event streams — India's UPI alone processes more daily transactions than all of LatAm combined. Data Engineers must build pipelines that ingest these event streams, normalize them against dLocal's existing data models, and make them available for real-time payment routing decisions, fraud detection, and analytics.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** update depends on dLocal's data infrastructure being ready for Asia-scale transaction volumes. JPM's bull case models assume dLocal can process Asian payment volumes without data pipeline bottlenecks or latency degradation. Data Engineers who build the infrastructure to handle this scale are directly enabling the revenue growth that supports DLO's upside price target.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** data engineering expertise — handling diverse payment event formats, multiple currencies, and varying data quality across LatAm — is a strong foundation for Asia. However, Asian markets introduce new challenges: India's UPI event volume is orders of magnitude larger than any single LatAm payment method, Southeast Asian mobile wallets generate different event schemas, and Asian data sovereignty laws require careful data pipeline architecture to ensure compliance.

For Data Engineers specifically, the Asia expansion means building real-time ingestion pipelines for Asian payment event streams, creating data transformation layers that normalize Asian payment data into dLocal's unified model, designing analytics infrastructure that spans two continents, and implementing data sovereignty controls for Asian regulatory compliance. This cross-continental data infrastructure scope is exceptionally complex.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Cross-Continental Data Infrastructure**
> "I build and maintain data pipelines that process payment events across 50+ emerging markets on two continents. Adding Asian payment streams — with different schemas, volumes, and latency requirements — doubles the data engineering complexity. This scope warrants Senior/Staff-level compensation."

**Lever 2: Asia-Scale Transaction Volume**
> "India's UPI alone processes 10+ billion monthly transactions. Building data infrastructure to handle this volume alongside existing LatAm pipelines requires sophisticated streaming architecture and horizontal scaling expertise. This scale is comparable to FAANG data engineering and should be compensated accordingly."

**Lever 3: Real-Time Pipeline Revenue Impact**
> "My pipelines power real-time payment routing decisions across Asian markets. Pipeline latency and reliability directly affect transaction approval rates — the core revenue KPI that JP Morgan's Feb 11 bull case depends on. My RSU grant should reflect this revenue-critical infrastructure ownership."

**Lever 4: EM Data Engineering Expertise Scarcity**
> "Data Engineers who can build financial data infrastructure across emerging markets — handling diverse formats, varying data quality, and multi-jurisdictional data sovereignty requirements — are extremely rare. This specialization commands a significant market premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In New York, start at $210,000 base + $155,000 RSU/yr (4yr vest). Accept no lower than $165,000 base + $95,000 RSU/yr. In São Paulo, start at R$390,000 base + R$310,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than R$290,000 base + R$180,000 RSU/yr. In Montevideo, start at UYU 2,900,000 base + UYU 2,100,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than UYU 2,000,000 base + UYU 1,200,000 RSU/yr. Negotiate cloud infrastructure budgets, data engineering tool licenses, and RSU refresh tied to Asia data pipeline launch milestones.
