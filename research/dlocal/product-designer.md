### Product Designer — dLocal Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes dLocal's Asia Priority strategy, translating the Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot and Feb 11 JPM Bull Case into a product design compensation framework spanning Montevideo, São Paulo, and New York markets. Product Designers at dLocal shape the merchant and consumer payment experiences that determine adoption across emerging markets in Asia.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 1,400,000 - 2,200,000 | UYU 700,000 - 1,400,000 | UYU 2,100,000 - 3,600,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$200,000 - R$320,000 | R$100,000 - R$220,000 | R$300,000 - R$540,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $140,000 - $200,000 | $60,000 - $120,000 | $200,000 - $320,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Designers at dLocal own the user experience layer that determines whether merchants adopt dLocal's payment platform and whether consumers complete checkout flows in new Asian markets. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot means designers must create payment UX that works across radically different user expectations — from India's UPI QR-code-first culture to Thailand's PromptPay mobile experience to Indonesia's OVO/DANA wallet ecosystem. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case ties DLO's upside to merchant adoption, which is fundamentally a design problem.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Designer I | Product Designer | UX Designer | Designer 1 | Junior Designer |
| Designer II | Senior Designer | Senior UX | Designer 2 | Mid Designer |
| Designer III | Lead/Staff Designer | Lead UX | Designer 3 | Senior Designer |

dLocal's design team is lean relative to the product surface area they cover. A dLocal Designer II owns checkout flow design, merchant dashboard UX, and API documentation design across multiple markets — a scope that Mercado Pago would spread across 2-3 designers. The Asia expansion multiplies this surface area without proportionally growing the team, further justifying scope-based compensation premiums.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** creates an enormous design challenge: dLocal must build payment experiences that feel native to Asian users while maintaining a coherent global platform. Asian payment UX differs fundamentally from LatAm — India's UPI payments are initiated via QR codes and deeplinks, Southeast Asian wallets use in-app payment flows, and each market has distinct checkout expectations for mobile-first consumers.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** update implicitly depends on strong UX design. Merchant adoption — a key driver of dLocal's TPV growth — is heavily influenced by the quality of the integration experience, checkout conversion rates, and dashboard usability. Product Designers who create high-converting, localized payment flows directly drive the TPV numbers that support JPM's bull case.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** design philosophy requires deep understanding of mobile-first, low-bandwidth, and diverse device contexts. Asian emerging markets amplify these constraints — designing for India's feature-phone-heavy market is different from designing for Singapore's smartphone-saturated one. Designers must create adaptive experiences that perform across this entire spectrum.

For Product Designers specifically, the Asia expansion means researching Asian payment UX patterns, designing localized checkout flows for 10+ new markets, creating merchant-facing dashboards that visualize cross-continental payment data, and establishing design systems that scale across both LatAm and Asian contexts. This is a uniquely complex design scope that commands premium compensation.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Cross-Cultural Payment UX Ownership**
> "I'm being asked to design payment experiences that work across both LatAm and Asian emerging markets — fundamentally different UX paradigms. QR-code payments in India, wallet flows in SE Asia, and PIX in Brazil all require distinct design patterns. This cross-cultural design scope warrants Senior/Lead-level compensation."

**Lever 2: Merchant Adoption = Revenue**
> "Checkout conversion rates and merchant onboarding UX directly drive dLocal's TPV. The better I design these flows for Asian markets, the faster dLocal realizes the revenue that JP Morgan's Feb 11 bull case projects. My compensation should reflect this revenue attribution."

**Lever 3: EM Payment Design Expertise Scarcity**
> "Designers who understand emerging market payment UX patterns across both LatAm and Asia are extraordinarily rare. This is not standard fintech design — it requires deep knowledge of local payment behaviors, mobile-first constraints, and regulatory-driven UI requirements."

**Lever 4: Design System Scale Impact**
> "I'll be building design systems that scale across 30+ emerging markets on two continents. The component libraries, interaction patterns, and localization frameworks I create will serve dLocal's product for years. This infrastructure-level design impact warrants equity-heavy compensation."
