### Software Engineer — dLocal Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes dLocal's Asia Priority strategy, translating the Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot and Feb 11 JPM Bull Case into a software engineering compensation framework spanning Montevideo, São Paulo, and New York markets. As the only pure-play emerging market payments platform on NASDAQ (DLO), dLocal offers unique equity upside tied directly to EM fintech expansion into Asia's fragmented payment landscape.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 1,200,000 - 1,800,000 | UYU 600,000 - 1,200,000 | UYU 1,800,000 - 3,000,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$180,000 - R$260,000 | R$90,000 - R$180,000 | R$270,000 - R$440,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $130,000 - $170,000 | $50,000 - $100,000 | $180,000 - $270,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Software Engineers at dLocal sit at the foundation of a platform processing payments across 40+ emerging markets. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot signals dLocal's expansion from its LatAm stronghold into Asia's massive, fragmented payment ecosystem — meaning every engineer's scope is expanding from LatAm-focused payment rails to a truly global emerging market platform. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case upgrade reinforces that DLO equity carries significant upside as Asia revenues materialize. Your code now powers cross-border payment infrastructure reaching billions of consumers across the world's fastest-growing economies.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| SWE I | Junior Engineer | Engenheiro Jr | Dev 1 | Eng I |
| SWE II | Mid Engineer | Engenheiro Pleno | Dev 2 | Eng II |
| SWE III | Senior-track | Engenheiro Senior | Dev 3 | Eng III |

dLocal's engineering levels are leaner than Mercado Pago's, meaning faster progression and broader scope per level. A dLocal SWE II typically handles responsibilities that Mercado Pago assigns to Dev 3, creating a strong case for title-adjusted compensation. The Asia expansion further broadens each level's scope — SWE IIs are now expected to build integrations with Asian payment schemes (UPI, GCash, PromptPay) on top of existing LatAm expertise.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** fundamentally changes what it means to be a Software Engineer at dLocal. Previously, engineers built payment processing infrastructure focused on Latin America — Brazil's PIX, Argentina's payment schemes, Mexico's SPEI. Now, dLocal has declared Asia its top expansion priority, requiring engineers to integrate with entirely new payment ecosystems across India (UPI), Southeast Asia (GCash, GrabPay, PromptPay), and beyond.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** upgrade validates this strategic direction. JPM's bull thesis prices in successful Asia penetration, meaning DLO stock — and therefore your RSU grants — carry substantial upside tied directly to the engineering team's ability to build and ship Asia payment integrations. JP Morgan specifically highlighted dLocal's unique NASDAQ-listed pure-play Emerging Market positioning as a competitive moat that neither Stripe nor Adyen can replicate.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** DNA means the company already has the regulatory, compliance, and local-payment-method expertise from 18 LatAm countries. Transplanting this playbook to Asia — where payment fragmentation is even more extreme — creates an enormous first-mover advantage. Engineers who join now will be the architects of Asia's cross-border payment infrastructure.

For Software Engineers specifically, the Asia expansion means building integrations with dozens of new local payment methods, real-time settlement systems across multiple Asian currencies, and low-latency routing engines optimized for Asia-Pacific traffic patterns. This skill stack — combining LatAm EM payments with Asia EM payments — is extraordinarily rare and commands premium compensation at any global fintech.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Asia Expansion Scope Premium**
> "My role now spans LatAm payment processing and the new Asia integration roadmap. I'm building connectors for UPI, GCash, and PromptPay on top of existing PIX and SPEI integrations. This is materially broader than LatAm-only engineering and warrants compensation reflecting a global emerging market platform scope."

**Lever 2: NASDAQ Pure-Play EM Scarcity**
> "dLocal is the only pure-play emerging market payments company on NASDAQ. The Feb 11 JPM Bull Case upgrade confirms the equity upside thesis. My RSU package should reflect the scarcity premium of DLO equity — there is no comparable public equity alternative in this space."

**Lever 3: EM Fintech Talent Scarcity**
> "Engineers who understand both LatAm and Asian emerging market payment infrastructure are exceptionally scarce. My market alternatives include Stripe, Adyen, and Mercado Pago, all of which are competing aggressively for this talent profile but lack dLocal's pure-play EM focus."

**Lever 4: Asia Revenue Upside Tied to Engineering Execution**
> "The Asia Strategic Pivot and JP Morgan's bull case thesis represent new revenue streams that directly depend on engineering execution. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect the revenue growth trajectory these markets create for DLO stock, with refresh grants tied to Asia launch milestones."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In New York, start at $165,000 base + $95,000 RSU/yr (4yr vest). Accept no lower than $140,000 base + $60,000 RSU/yr. In São Paulo, start at R$250,000 base + R$170,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than R$195,000 base + R$100,000 RSU/yr. In Montevideo, start at UYU 1,750,000 base + UYU 1,100,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than UYU 1,350,000 base + UYU 700,000 RSU/yr. Always negotiate RSU refresh grants tied to Asia expansion milestones.
