### DevOps Engineer — dLocal Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes dLocal's Asia Priority strategy, translating the Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot and Feb 11 JPM Bull Case into a DevOps engineering compensation framework spanning Montevideo, São Paulo, and New York markets. DevOps Engineers at dLocal ensure the emerging market payment platform operates with financial-grade reliability, scalability, and compliance across two continents.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 1,800,000 - 2,800,000 | UYU 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 | UYU 2,800,000 - 4,800,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$260,000 - R$380,000 | R$150,000 - R$280,000 | R$410,000 - R$660,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $155,000 - $210,000 | $80,000 - $150,000 | $235,000 - $360,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: DevOps Engineers at dLocal manage infrastructure that processes real-time financial transactions across 40+ emerging markets — each with different latency profiles, regulatory data residency requirements, and connectivity challenges. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot massively expands the infrastructure footprint: dLocal must deploy across Asia-Pacific cloud regions, establish low-latency connections to Asian acquiring banks and payment schemes, and meet data sovereignty requirements across India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and other Asian markets. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case depends on platform reliability and speed of deployment to new Asian markets — both core DevOps deliverables.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| DevOps | DevOps Engineer | Infra Engineer | SRE (L4) | DevOps |
| Senior DevOps | Senior DevOps | Senior Infra | Senior SRE (L5) | Senior DevOps |
| Staff DevOps | Staff / Platform Eng | Lead Infra | Staff SRE (L6) | Lead DevOps |

dLocal's DevOps team manages a disproportionately large infrastructure footprint relative to team size. A dLocal DevOps engineer typically owns infrastructure spanning multiple cloud regions, local payment network connections, and regulatory-compliant deployment pipelines across 10+ countries. The Asia expansion adds 5-10 new cloud regions and dozens of new network integrations. This scope would require 3-4 engineers at Mercado Pago.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** introduces infrastructure requirements that significantly expand the DevOps role. Asian markets require new cloud region deployments (Mumbai, Singapore, Jakarta, Tokyo), connections to Asian payment networks (UPI, QRIS, PromptPay), and compliance with data localization laws like India's RBI data localization mandate and Indonesia's GR 71 data sovereignty requirements. DevOps engineers must build this infrastructure while maintaining sub-100ms payment processing latency.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** update depends on dLocal's ability to rapidly deploy into new Asian markets. Infrastructure deployment velocity — how fast DevOps can stand up compliant, low-latency payment processing in a new country — directly determines the speed of Asia revenue growth. JP Morgan's bull case timeline assumes aggressive market entry, which is fundamentally a DevOps execution challenge.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** infrastructure expertise is a significant competitive advantage. Years of operating in LatAm — where cloud availability is limited, network reliability is variable, and data residency rules are strict — has built DevOps muscle that translates directly to Asia. Many Asian emerging markets present identical infrastructure challenges that dLocal's DevOps team has already solved in LatAm.

For DevOps Engineers specifically, the Asia expansion means deploying and managing infrastructure across 5+ new cloud regions, building connectivity to dozens of Asian payment networks, implementing data sovereignty controls for multiple Asian jurisdictions, and creating CI/CD pipelines that support rapid market entry. This multi-continental infrastructure scope is exceptionally complex.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Multi-Continental Infrastructure Ownership**
> "I manage infrastructure spanning LatAm and Asia — multiple cloud providers, dozens of payment network integrations, and data sovereignty controls across 20+ regulatory jurisdictions. This multi-continental DevOps scope warrants Senior/Staff-level compensation."

**Lever 2: Financial-Grade Reliability Standards**
> "My infrastructure must meet 99.99% uptime for real-time financial transactions, with sub-100ms latency across Asian payment networks. This financial-grade reliability requirement across emerging market infrastructure far exceeds standard DevOps scope."

**Lever 3: Asia Deployment Velocity = Revenue**
> "How fast I can deploy compliant infrastructure in new Asian markets directly determines the speed of dLocal's Asia revenue growth — the core thesis in JP Morgan's Feb 11 bull case. My RSU package should reflect this revenue velocity dependency."

**Lever 4: EM Infrastructure Expertise Scarcity**
> "DevOps engineers who can operate financial infrastructure across emerging markets — navigating limited cloud availability, variable network reliability, and strict data sovereignty — are extremely rare. Stripe and Adyen are both hiring for this profile at premium compensation."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In New York, start at $205,000 base + $140,000 RSU/yr (4yr vest). Accept no lower than $165,000 base + $90,000 RSU/yr. In São Paulo, start at R$370,000 base + R$270,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than R$280,000 base + R$165,000 RSU/yr. In Montevideo, start at UYU 2,700,000 base + UYU 1,900,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than UYU 2,000,000 base + UYU 1,100,000 RSU/yr. Negotiate on-call compensation, cloud certification budgets, and RSU refresh tied to Asia region deployment milestones.
