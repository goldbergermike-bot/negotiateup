### Senior Software Engineer — dLocal Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes dLocal's Asia Priority strategy, translating the Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot and Feb 11 JPM Bull Case into a senior software engineering compensation framework spanning Montevideo, São Paulo, and New York markets. Senior engineers are the execution backbone of dLocal's push into Asia — the largest emerging market opportunity in cross-border payments.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 1,900,000 - 2,800,000 | UYU 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 | UYU 2,900,000 - 4,800,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$280,000 - R$400,000 | R$140,000 - R$280,000 | R$420,000 - R$680,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $175,000 - $230,000 | $80,000 - $150,000 | $255,000 - $380,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Senior Software Engineers at dLocal are the technical leaders who will architect and deliver the Asia payment integrations that JP Morgan's bull case thesis depends on. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot places senior engineers at the center of dLocal's most important strategic bet — expanding its proven LatAm emerging market platform into India, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. With the Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case upgrade, DLO equity now prices in significant Asia expansion upside, making RSU grants a critical component of total compensation. Senior engineers who build the Asia payment infrastructure are building the revenue engine that drives DLO stock appreciation.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Senior SWE | Tech Lead-track | Engenheiro Senior | Dev 3-4 | Senior Eng |
| Senior SWE II | Staff-track | Lead Engineer | Dev 5 | Staff Eng |

dLocal's Senior SWE role carries broader scope than equivalent titles at Ebanx or PagSeguro, spanning multiple services and cross-border payment flows. With the Asia expansion, senior engineers now own end-to-end integration architecture across 2+ continental payment ecosystems — a scope that Mercado Pago would staff across multiple teams. This cross-continental ownership justifies compensation at or above the top of Mercado Pago's Dev 4-5 band.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** elevates Senior Software Engineers from LatAm payment specialists to global emerging market platform architects. dLocal has made Asia its top expansion priority, recognizing that Asia's fragmented payment landscape — with hundreds of local payment methods across India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, and more — mirrors the complexity that dLocal already conquered in Latin America.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** update specifically highlights the revenue TAM expansion that Asia represents. JPM's bull case models assume successful payment method integration across India's UPI (processing $2T+ annually), Indonesia's QRIS, Vietnam's VNPay, and Thailand's PromptPay. Senior engineers are the ones who must build, test, and ship these integrations — making them directly responsible for realizing the JP Morgan bull case revenue projections.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** positioning as the only NASDAQ-listed pure-play EM payments company means senior engineers work on genuinely unique infrastructure. Unlike Stripe or Adyen (which focus on developed markets with EM as a side offering), dLocal's entire product thesis is emerging markets. The Asia pivot extends this thesis to the world's largest EM economies.

For Senior Software Engineers specifically, this means owning the technical architecture for Asia payment integrations — designing settlement systems for new currencies (INR, IDR, VND, THB, PHP), building compliance-aware payment routing, and creating the real-time FX infrastructure that enables cross-border transactions between Asian and LatAm corridors. This is a career-defining opportunity to build payment infrastructure at continental scale.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Asia Architecture Ownership**
> "As a Senior Engineer, I'll be designing the core payment integration architecture for dLocal's Asia expansion — UPI, QRIS, PromptPay, and more. This is dLocal's top strategic priority per the Jan 2026 pivot, and the technical complexity of multi-country Asian payment systems warrants senior-staff level compensation."

**Lever 2: JPM Bull Case Execution Premium**
> "JP Morgan's Feb 11 bull case thesis depends on engineering execution of the Asia roadmap. My RSU package should reflect that I'm directly responsible for delivering the revenue streams that support DLO's upside price target. I'd like a grant that rewards me proportionally for Asia milestone delivery."

**Lever 3: Cross-Continental EM Payments Expertise**
> "Engineers who can architect payment systems across both LatAm and Asian emerging markets are among the rarest profiles in fintech. Adyen and Stripe are hiring aggressively for this skillset but lack the pure-play EM focus. My compensation should reflect this talent scarcity."

**Lever 4: First-Mover Technical Leadership**
> "dLocal is establishing first-mover advantage in Asia's fragmented payment landscape. The technical decisions I make now will define dLocal's Asia infrastructure for years. This level of architectural impact warrants compensation aligned with Staff Engineer benchmarks at peer companies."
