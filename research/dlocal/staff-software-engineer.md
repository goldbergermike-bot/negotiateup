### Staff Software Engineer — dLocal Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes dLocal's Asia Priority strategy, translating the Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot and Feb 11 JPM Bull Case into a staff-level engineering compensation framework spanning Montevideo, São Paulo, and New York markets. Staff engineers are the strategic technical leaders who will define dLocal's architecture for Asia's massive emerging market payment opportunity.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 2,800,000 - 4,200,000 | UYU 1,800,000 - 3,500,000 | UYU 4,600,000 - 7,700,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$400,000 - R$580,000 | R$250,000 - R$450,000 | R$650,000 - R$1,030,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $230,000 - $300,000 | $130,000 - $250,000 | $360,000 - $550,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Staff Software Engineers at dLocal define the technical strategy that determines whether the company's Asia expansion succeeds or fails. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot requires a Staff engineer who can design payment platform architecture spanning dozens of Asian local payment methods, currencies, and regulatory frameworks — building on the LatAm architecture foundation. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case upgrade puts a price target on exactly this execution. DLO's NASDAQ equity gives Staff engineers direct financial exposure to the Asia buildout they are architecting, creating a rare alignment between technical leadership and equity upside.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Staff Engineer | Principal-track | N/A (no equiv.) | Dev 6 | Principal |
| Staff Engineer II | Distinguished | N/A | Dev 7 | Distinguished |

dLocal's Staff Engineer role is exceptionally rare within the company — fewer than 10 engineers hold this title globally. This scarcity, combined with the Asia expansion mandate, means Staff engineers at dLocal wield influence comparable to VP-level engineering roles at larger companies like Mercado Pago. Ebanx has no true Staff-level equivalent, reflecting dLocal's more sophisticated engineering organization.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** makes Staff Software Engineers the most strategically critical technical hires at dLocal. Staff engineers will set the architectural direction for the entire Asia expansion — deciding how dLocal's platform connects to India's UPI ecosystem, Indonesia's QRIS standard, Vietnam's local payment rails, and Thailand's PromptPay network. These architectural decisions will determine dLocal's competitive position in Asia for the next decade.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** update explicitly ties DLO's upside to the speed and quality of Asia market entry. For Staff engineers, this means their architectural decisions have direct, measurable impact on the company's stock price and market capitalization. JPM's analyst notes reference "platform scalability" and "multi-market integration speed" as key variables in their bull case — both of which are Staff engineer deliverables.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** expertise — built over years of navigating LatAm's regulatory complexity, currency volatility, and payment fragmentation — is the moat that makes the Asia pivot viable. Staff engineers who helped build this LatAm infrastructure are uniquely positioned to replicate it in Asia, where payment fragmentation is even more extreme. dLocal's NASDAQ listing makes it the only pure-play EM payments company with publicly traded equity, giving Staff engineers a transparent and liquid equity stake in their own work.

For Staff Engineers specifically, the Asia expansion represents a once-in-a-career opportunity to design continental-scale payment infrastructure from scratch. The decisions made in 2026 — payment routing architecture, settlement engine design, FX optimization algorithms, compliance framework patterns — will compound for years. This architectural impact justifies compensation at or above Principal Engineer levels at Stripe, Adyen, or PayPal.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Continental Architecture Ownership**
> "I'm being asked to design dLocal's Asia payment platform from the ground up — architecture that will process billions in transactions across 10+ Asian markets. This is equivalent to a founding-engineer scope and warrants principal-level total compensation."

**Lever 2: JPM Bull Case Direct Accountability**
> "JP Morgan's Feb 11 bull case thesis lists platform scalability and multi-market integration speed as key upside drivers. As a Staff Engineer, I am directly accountable for both. My equity package should reflect this — I want a grant sized to the revenue impact my architecture decisions create."

**Lever 3: NASDAQ EM Pure-Play Scarcity**
> "There is no other NASDAQ-listed pure-play emerging market payments company. DLO equity is uniquely positioned for Asia EM expansion upside, and I should receive a Staff-level grant that reflects this scarcity premium and my role in realizing it."

**Lever 4: Talent Market Alternative — FAANG/Stripe/Adyen**
> "Staff-level engineers with EM payments expertise are actively recruited by Stripe, Adyen, PayPal, and FAANG companies at $500K+ total comp packages. My dLocal offer should be competitive with these alternatives, adjusted for the DLO equity upside thesis."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In New York, start at $290,000 base + $240,000 RSU/yr (4yr vest). Accept no lower than $240,000 base + $150,000 RSU/yr. In São Paulo, start at R$560,000 base + R$420,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than R$430,000 base + R$280,000 RSU/yr. In Montevideo, start at UYU 4,000,000 base + UYU 3,200,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than UYU 3,100,000 base + UYU 2,000,000 RSU/yr. Negotiate a signing bonus of 25% of first-year RSU value and accelerated vesting tied to Asia platform milestones.
