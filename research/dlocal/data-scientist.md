### Data Scientist — dLocal Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes dLocal's Asia Priority strategy, translating the Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot and Feb 11 JPM Bull Case into a data science compensation framework spanning Montevideo, São Paulo, and New York markets. Data Scientists at dLocal build the models that optimize payment routing, detect fraud, and forecast performance across the world's most complex emerging market payment ecosystems.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 1,800,000 - 2,800,000 | UYU 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 | UYU 2,800,000 - 4,800,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$250,000 - R$380,000 | R$130,000 - R$260,000 | R$380,000 - R$640,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $160,000 - $220,000 | $70,000 - $140,000 | $230,000 - $360,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Scientists at dLocal operate on uniquely challenging datasets — payment transactions across 40+ emerging markets with distinct fraud patterns, currency dynamics, and approval rate drivers. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot doubles this complexity by adding Asian payment data streams with entirely different statistical properties. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case thesis depends on dLocal achieving best-in-class payment success rates in Asia, which is fundamentally a data science problem — optimizing routing, predicting fraud, and maximizing approval rates across fragmented Asian payment rails.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| DS I | Data Scientist | Analista de Dados | DS 1 | Data Analyst |
| DS II | Senior DS | Cientista de Dados | DS 2 | Data Scientist |
| DS III | Lead/Staff DS | Lead DS | DS 3 | Senior DS |

dLocal's Data Scientists work on higher-complexity problems than equivalents at Ebanx or PagSeguro due to dLocal's broader geographic scope. A dLocal DS II builds models spanning 40+ countries with different fraud profiles, currency correlations, and payment method behaviors — a data complexity level that Mercado Pago assigns to DS 3 and above.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** creates a massive expansion in data science scope. Asian payment data has fundamentally different statistical properties from LatAm — India's UPI transactions have different velocity patterns, fraud vectors, and approval rate dynamics than Brazil's PIX. Southeast Asian mobile wallet transactions (GCash, GrabPay, OVO) follow distinct behavioral patterns shaped by different consumer demographics. Data Scientists must build models that generalize across these diverse data distributions.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** update hinges on dLocal achieving competitive approval rates and low fraud rates in new Asian markets. These are directly data science KPIs. JP Morgan's analyst models assume dLocal can replicate its LatAm approval rate optimization in Asia — an assumption that only holds if Data Scientists successfully adapt their models to Asian payment patterns.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** data advantage is a significant moat. Years of processing payments across 18+ LatAm markets have generated proprietary datasets on EM payment behavior that no competitor can replicate. As dLocal enters Asia, this data advantage compounds — Data Scientists can apply transfer learning from LatAm fraud patterns to bootstrap Asian fraud models, creating a first-mover advantage in Asia payment optimization.

For Data Scientists specifically, the Asia expansion means building new fraud detection models for Asian payment methods, creating approval rate optimization engines for Asian acquiring banks, developing FX prediction models for Asian currency pairs, and designing A/B testing frameworks for multi-market payment routing experiments. This cross-continental modeling scope is exceptionally rare in the industry.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Cross-Continental Model Complexity**
> "I'm building models that must perform across 50+ emerging markets on two continents, with fundamentally different data distributions. This is not standard fintech data science — it requires transfer learning, multi-domain modeling, and real-time adaptation across dozens of payment ecosystems. This complexity warrants Staff/Lead DS compensation."

**Lever 2: Approval Rate = Revenue Attribution**
> "Every percentage point improvement in payment approval rates directly translates to revenue for dLocal. My models are responsible for optimizing approval rates across all Asian markets — a direct revenue driver that supports the JPM Feb 11 bull case price target. My RSU grant should reflect this revenue attribution."

**Lever 3: Proprietary EM Data Advantage**
> "dLocal's multi-year LatAm payment dataset is a proprietary asset, and I'll be applying transfer learning from this data to bootstrap Asian market models. This data science capability creates competitive moat and warrants premium compensation."

**Lever 4: EM Payments DS Talent Scarcity**
> "Data Scientists with experience modeling payment behavior across emerging markets — especially cross-continental EM — are extremely rare. My alternative offers from Stripe, Adyen, and major tech companies are in the ranges I'm requesting, without the EM specialization premium."
