#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 2,200,000 - 3,400,000 | UYU 1,400,000 - 2,600,000 | UYU 3,600,000 - 6,000,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$310,000 - R$440,000 | R$190,000 - R$350,000 | R$500,000 - R$790,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $165,000 - $225,000 | $95,000 - $175,000 | $260,000 - $400,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Technical Program Managers at dLocal manage programs of extraordinary complexity. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot requires coordinating payment method integrations, regulatory approvals, cloud infrastructure deployments, and merchant onboarding across multiple Asian countries simultaneously. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case depends on execution timeline — how fast dLocal can launch in Asian markets. TPMs own this timeline, managing cross-functional dependencies spanning engineering, compliance, legal, and partnerships across 3+ continents. This multi-stakeholder, multi-market, multi-continental program management is Director-level scope at larger companies.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| TPM | Technical PM | Project Manager | TPM (L5) | Project Manager |
| Senior TPM | Senior TPM | Senior PM | Senior TPM (L6) | Senior PM |
| Staff TPM | Staff / Director TPM | Director PM | Staff TPM (L7) | Director PM |

dLocal TPMs manage larger, more complex programs than equivalents at Ebanx or PagSeguro because dLocal's market coverage (40+ countries) and the Asia expansion create exponentially more coordination requirements. A dLocal TPM handles programs that would require 2-3 TPMs at Mercado Pago.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** makes Technical Program Managers the execution orchestrators of dLocal's most important strategic initiative. Launching payment processing in each new Asian market requires coordinating: (1) payment method technical integration, (2) regulatory licensing and compliance, (3) cloud infrastructure deployment, (4) acquiring bank partnerships, (5) merchant onboarding, and (6) fraud/risk model calibration — all in parallel across multiple countries with different timelines and requirements.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** update places a premium on execution speed. JPM's bull case models assume specific Asia launch timelines — each quarter of delay in market entry directly reduces the bull case valuation. TPMs who keep Asia launches on schedule are directly protecting and realizing DLO's stock price upside. This makes TPM execution one of the most equity-relevant functions at the company.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** program management expertise — built through years of launching in LatAm countries with complex regulatory environments and banking relationships — is directly transferable to Asia. TPMs who have managed LatAm market launches understand the playbook: regulatory sequencing, local partnership establishment, phased rollouts, and compliance verification. Asia requires the same playbook at larger scale.

For TPMs specifically, the Asia expansion means managing a portfolio of concurrent country-launch programs across Asia, coordinating with Asian regulatory bodies and banking partners in new time zones, and maintaining the existing LatAm program portfolio simultaneously. This multi-continental portfolio management scope warrants Staff TPM or Director-level compensation.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Multi-Continental Program Portfolio**
> "I manage concurrent market launch programs across LatAm and Asia — each with distinct regulatory timelines, banking partner dependencies, and engineering workstreams. This multi-continental program portfolio is Director-level TPM scope at FAANG companies."

**Lever 2: Asia Launch Timeline = Stock Price**
> "JP Morgan's Feb 11 bull case depends on specific Asia launch timelines that I am directly responsible for managing. My RSU grant should reflect my role in protecting and realizing DLO's bull case valuation through on-time Asia market delivery."

**Lever 3: Cross-Timezone Stakeholder Coordination**
> "Coordinating engineering teams in Montevideo, compliance teams in New York, and banking partners in Singapore, Mumbai, and Jakarta across a 12+ hour timezone spread requires exceptional program management skill. This cross-timezone complexity warrants premium compensation."

**Lever 4: Financial Services Program Expertise**
> "Managing programs that involve payment licensing, regulatory compliance, banking partnerships, and financial infrastructure deployment requires specialized fintech TPM expertise. This domain specialization commands a 15-25% premium over general-purpose TPM compensation."
