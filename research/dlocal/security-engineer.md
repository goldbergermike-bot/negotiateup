### Security Engineer — dLocal Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes dLocal's Asia Priority strategy, translating the Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot and Feb 11 JPM Bull Case into a security engineering compensation framework spanning Montevideo, São Paulo, and New York markets. Security Engineers at dLocal protect the emerging market payment platform as it expands into Asia — ensuring financial-grade security across the world's most diverse and challenging regulatory landscape.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 2,000,000 - 3,200,000 | UYU 1,200,000 - 2,400,000 | UYU 3,200,000 - 5,600,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$290,000 - R$420,000 | R$170,000 - R$330,000 | R$460,000 - R$750,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $165,000 - $225,000 | $90,000 - $170,000 | $255,000 - $395,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers at dLocal operate in one of the most complex security environments in fintech. The platform processes financial transactions across 40+ emerging markets, each with different data protection laws, financial security regulations, and threat landscapes. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot significantly expands the attack surface — Asian markets introduce new threat vectors (UPI-related fraud, Southeast Asian SIM-swap attacks, cross-border money laundering patterns), new regulatory frameworks (India's RBI cybersecurity guidelines, Singapore's MAS TRM), and new data sovereignty requirements. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case implicitly assumes dLocal can expand into Asia without a major security incident — making security engineering a prerequisite for the bull case thesis.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Security Eng | Security Engineer | InfoSec Analyst | Security Eng (L4) | Security Eng |
| Senior SecEng | Senior Security Eng | Senior InfoSec | Senior SecEng (L5) | Senior SecEng |
| Staff SecEng | Staff / Lead Security | Security Lead | Staff SecEng (L6) | Lead SecEng |

Security engineers at dLocal handle a broader regulatory surface than peers at Ebanx (LatAm only) or PagSeguro (Brazil focused). The Asia expansion adds PCI DSS considerations for Asian acquirers, RBI cybersecurity mandates for India, MAS TRM for Singapore, and OJK regulations for Indonesia — on top of existing LatAm compliance. This regulatory breadth commands a premium.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** dramatically expands the security engineering mandate. Asian markets introduce new threat landscapes — India's UPI ecosystem has unique fraud patterns, Southeast Asian markets face sophisticated SIM-swap and social engineering attacks, and cross-border payment flows between LatAm and Asia create new money laundering typologies. Security Engineers must build threat detection and prevention systems that work across all these attack vectors simultaneously.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** update implicitly requires zero major security breaches during the Asia expansion. A significant data breach or fraud event in a new Asian market could undermine merchant trust, regulatory standing, and the entire Asia growth thesis. Security Engineers are the guardians of the bull case — their work protects the revenue growth that JPM's analyst models project.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** security expertise — understanding fraud patterns, regulatory compliance, and threat landscapes across LatAm — is directly applicable to Asia. However, Asian markets add new dimensions: mobile-first payment security (UPI, QR-code payments), government-mandated security standards (India's RBI, Singapore's MAS), and data sovereignty requirements that affect where security logs and incident data can be stored and processed.

For Security Engineers specifically, the Asia expansion means building security controls for new Asian payment integrations, implementing compliance frameworks for Asian regulatory bodies, extending threat detection systems to cover Asian fraud patterns, and managing security operations across a 12+ hour timezone spread. This cross-continental security scope justifies Staff-level compensation.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Cross-Continental Security Surface**
> "I protect a payment platform spanning 50+ emerging markets across LatAm and Asia — each with different threat landscapes, regulatory requirements, and data protection laws. This cross-continental security scope is Staff/Lead-level and should be compensated accordingly."

**Lever 2: Bull Case Protection Premium**
> "A major security breach in Asia could derail dLocal's entire expansion thesis and the stock price appreciation that JP Morgan's Feb 11 bull case projects. My security work directly protects the company's market capitalization. My RSU grant should reflect this risk-mitigation value."

**Lever 3: Multi-Regulatory Compliance Ownership**
> "I ensure compliance with PCI DSS, LGPD, RBI cybersecurity guidelines, MAS TRM, and 30+ other frameworks simultaneously. This multi-regulatory security compliance scope is exceptionally rare and commands premium compensation."

**Lever 4: EM Security Expertise Scarcity**
> "Security engineers who understand emerging market threat landscapes — SIM swap fraud, mobile money attacks, social engineering patterns unique to EM populations — across both LatAm and Asia are virtually impossible to find. This expertise commands a significant market premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In New York, start at $220,000 base + $160,000 RSU/yr (4yr vest). Accept no lower than $175,000 base + $100,000 RSU/yr. In São Paulo, start at R$410,000 base + R$320,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than R$310,000 base + R$190,000 RSU/yr. In Montevideo, start at UYU 3,100,000 base + UYU 2,300,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than UYU 2,200,000 base + UYU 1,400,000 RSU/yr. Negotiate security certification budgets (CISSP, OSCP), conference attendance, and RSU grants tied to zero-breach milestones.
