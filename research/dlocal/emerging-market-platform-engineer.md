### Emerging Market Platform Engineer — dLocal Salary Negotiation Guide

**SIGNATURE ROLE — This is the definitive negotiation guide for dLocal's most strategically critical engineering role: the Emerging Market Platform Engineer. This role sits at the intersection of dLocal's Asia expansion, its NASDAQ-listed pure-play EM positioning, and the cross-continental payment infrastructure buildout that JP Morgan's bull case thesis depends on.**

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes dLocal's Asia Priority strategy, translating the Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot and Feb 11 JPM Bull Case into a comprehensive emerging market platform engineering compensation framework spanning Montevideo, São Paulo, and New York markets. The Emerging Market Platform Engineer is dLocal's keystone role — the engineer who designs, builds, and operates the cross-continental payment platform that connects LatAm's proven infrastructure to Asia's massive, fragmented opportunity. This is the role where dLocal's entire strategic thesis converges: NASDAQ-listed pure-play EM positioning, Asia-first expansion priority, and JP Morgan-validated equity upside.

**Negotiation DNA**: The Emerging Market Platform Engineer at dLocal is not a standard engineering role — it is the role that defines whether dLocal's Asia expansion succeeds. This engineer owns the platform layer that abstracts payment complexity across 50+ emerging markets on two continents, enabling dLocal to rapidly integrate new Asian payment methods while maintaining the reliability and performance of the existing LatAm platform. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot made this role dLocal's top hiring priority. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case upgrade priced in the successful execution of exactly this work — meaning this engineer's output has direct, measurable impact on DLO's stock price and market capitalization. No other role at dLocal carries this unique combination of technical scope, strategic importance, and equity-moving impact.

---

#### Why This Is the SIGNATURE ROLE at dLocal

The Emerging Market Platform Engineer is the role that embodies dLocal's entire value proposition as a company. Consider:

1. **dLocal exists to solve the emerging market payment problem.** Every other role at the company supports this mission. The EM Platform Engineer *is* this mission — designing the platform architecture that makes cross-border payments possible in markets where infrastructure is fragmented, regulations vary by country, currencies are volatile, and local payment methods number in the hundreds.

2. **The Asia expansion is dLocal's most important strategic bet.** The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot declared Asia the company's top priority. The EM Platform Engineer is the one who extends the platform from LatAm to Asia — designing the abstraction layers, integration patterns, and settlement systems that make "one platform, two continents" a reality.

3. **JP Morgan's bull case depends on this role.** The Feb 11, 2026 JPM Bull Case upgrade explicitly ties DLO upside to platform scalability and market entry speed. Both are EM Platform Engineer deliverables. This role's output is literally what JP Morgan is betting on.

4. **NASDAQ pure-play EM scarcity.** dLocal is the only NASDAQ-listed pure-play emerging market payments company. The EM Platform Engineer builds the infrastructure that justifies this unique market position — and receives RSU grants in equity that has no direct comparable on any public exchange.

This convergence of technical scope, strategic importance, and equity alignment makes the EM Platform Engineer the highest-leverage individual contributor role at dLocal.

---

#### Role Definition & Technical Scope

The Emerging Market Platform Engineer operates across three critical layers:

**Layer 1: Payment Abstraction Platform**
- Design and maintain the platform abstraction layer that normalizes 200+ local payment methods across LatAm and Asia into a unified merchant-facing API
- Build payment method adapters for Asian payment schemes: UPI (India), QRIS (Indonesia), PromptPay (Thailand), VNPay (Vietnam), GCash (Philippines), GrabPay (Southeast Asia), KakaoPay (South Korea), and more
- Design the payment routing engine that dynamically selects the optimal processing path across multiple acquiring banks and payment networks in each Asian market
- Implement real-time FX engines for Asian currency pairs (USD/INR, USD/IDR, USD/THB, USD/VND, USD/PHP) alongside existing LatAm pairs

**Layer 2: Cross-Continental Settlement Architecture**
- Architect settlement systems that handle multi-currency, multi-timezone settlement across LatAm and Asian markets
- Build reconciliation engines that match transaction-level data across dozens of acquiring bank partners, each with different reporting formats and timelines
- Design compliance-aware settlement flows that respect regulatory requirements in each market (RBI settlement rules in India, BI regulations in Indonesia, BOT rules in Thailand)
- Implement real-time settlement monitoring with automated alerting and exception handling

**Layer 3: Regulatory & Compliance Infrastructure**
- Build the compliance infrastructure layer that encodes regulatory requirements for each market — KYC/AML rules, data localization mandates, transaction reporting requirements
- Design data sovereignty controls that ensure payment data is stored and processed in accordance with each country's data protection laws (India's RBI data localization, Indonesia's GR 71, Thailand's PDPA)
- Implement regulatory reporting pipelines that generate country-specific compliance reports for regulatory bodies across both continents

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| EM Platform Eng | Senior/Staff Engineer | No equivalent | Platform Eng (L5-6) | No equivalent |
| Senior EM Platform | Staff/Principal | No equivalent | Senior Platform (L6-7) | No equivalent |
| Lead EM Platform | Principal/Distinguished | No equivalent | Principal (L7-8) | No equivalent |

**This role has no direct equivalent at Ebanx or PagSeguro** — neither company operates a cross-continental emerging market payment platform. Ebanx is LatAm-only; PagSeguro is Brazil-focused. The closest comparisons are Mercado Pago's platform engineering team (but limited to LatAm) and Stripe's payment method integration team (but focused on developed markets). dLocal's EM Platform Engineer combines the geographic scope of Stripe with the EM specialization of Mercado Pago — a unique combination that justifies compensation at the top of either company's bands.

At Stripe, a comparable role (Staff Platform Engineer, Payment Methods) commands $450K-$600K total comp in New York. At Adyen, equivalent platform roles pay $350K-$500K. dLocal's EM Platform Engineer should benchmark at 70-85% of Stripe TC, with the delta covered by DLO equity upside tied to the Asia expansion.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

**This section is the core of the SIGNATURE ROLE negotiation strategy. Every element of dLocal's Asia Priority and Emerging Market positioning converges on the EM Platform Engineer.**

##### The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot

In January 2026, dLocal's leadership declared Asia the company's top expansion priority. This was not an incremental decision — it was a strategic pivot that redirected the company's product roadmap, engineering resources, and hiring priorities toward Asian markets. The rationale is compelling:

- **TAM expansion**: Asia's cross-border payment market exceeds $4T annually, more than double LatAm's $1.4T. Adding Asia to dLocal's platform doubles the company's addressable market.
- **Payment fragmentation opportunity**: Asia's payment landscape is more fragmented than LatAm's — India alone has UPI, Paytm, PhonePe, bank transfers, and cash-on-delivery. Southeast Asia adds GCash, GrabPay, OVO, DANA, ShopeePay, Touch 'n Go, and dozens more. This fragmentation is exactly the problem dLocal solves — and the EM Platform Engineer builds the platform that solves it.
- **First-mover advantage**: No other NASDAQ-listed company offers a purpose-built emerging market payment platform for Asia. Stripe and Adyen cover Asian markets as a subset of their global offerings, but lack the EM-specialized architecture that dLocal has built. The EM Platform Engineer is building the infrastructure that creates dLocal's first-mover advantage in Asia.
- **Merchant demand pull**: dLocal's existing LatAm merchants — global enterprises like Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, and Uber — also need Asia payment processing. The EM Platform Engineer builds the "one integration, both continents" capability that retains and expands these enterprise relationships.

For the EM Platform Engineer, the Asia pivot means: you are designing and building the payment platform infrastructure for the world's largest emerging market opportunity. The architectural decisions you make in 2026 will define dLocal's competitive position in Asia for the next decade.

##### The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case

On February 11, 2026, JP Morgan updated their coverage of dLocal with a bull case thesis that explicitly ties DLO upside to successful Asia expansion. Key elements of JPM's analysis:

- **Revenue growth acceleration**: JPM's bull case models project significant revenue growth from Asian markets beginning in late 2026, with full contribution by 2028. This revenue growth is conditional on platform readiness — which is the EM Platform Engineer's direct deliverable.
- **Platform scalability as value driver**: JPM specifically cites "platform scalability across new geographic markets" as a key upside variable. The EM Platform Engineer designs this scalability — the abstraction layers, integration patterns, and routing engines that allow dLocal to add new Asian markets rapidly.
- **Competitive moat through EM specialization**: JPM notes that dLocal's pure-play EM positioning creates a competitive moat that generalist payment companies cannot easily replicate. The EM Platform Engineer is the builder of this moat — every market-specific integration, every regulatory compliance layer, every local payment method adapter deepens the competitive advantage.
- **DLO equity upside**: JPM's bull case price target implies significant upside from current trading levels. As an RSU holder, the EM Platform Engineer has direct financial exposure to this upside. More importantly, the engineer's work *creates* the upside — making this one of the rare cases where individual contributor output has measurable impact on public company stock price.

For the EM Platform Engineer, the JPM Bull Case means: your equity is not just compensation — it is a direct investment in your own engineering output. The better you build the Asia platform, the more your RSUs are worth. This alignment between work output and equity value is the strongest possible negotiation lever for maximizing your RSU grant.

##### Emerging Market Positioning as Competitive Moat

dLocal's identity as the only NASDAQ-listed pure-play emerging market payments company creates unique dynamics for the EM Platform Engineer:

- **No comparable public equity**: There is no other publicly traded company that offers pure-play exposure to EM payment platform infrastructure. This means DLO equity carries a scarcity premium that should be reflected in RSU grant sizing.
- **EM expertise compounds**: Every market the EM Platform Engineer integrates, every regulatory framework encoded into the platform, and every local payment method adapter built creates institutional knowledge that is extremely difficult for competitors to replicate. This compounding expertise justifies accelerating RSU vesting and increasing refresh grants over time.
- **Career uniqueness**: Building cross-continental EM payment infrastructure is a career experience available at exactly one company on a public exchange. This uniqueness should be reflected in premium total compensation, because the skills and experience gained are extraordinarily valuable to any company expanding into emerging markets.
- **Dual-continent EM platform**: With the Asia expansion, the EM Platform Engineer builds the only payment platform spanning LatAm and Asian emerging markets. This dual-continent architecture creates defensive moats and offensive capabilities that no single-continent competitor can match.

##### How This Role Benefits from the Asia Priority

The EM Platform Engineer benefits from the Asia Priority in specific, quantifiable ways:

1. **Scope expansion = comp expansion**: The Asia pivot doubles the platform's geographic scope, justifying a proportional increase in compensation. The role went from "LatAm payment platform" to "global EM payment platform" — a fundamental scope change.
2. **RSU upside tied to your output**: JP Morgan's bull case thesis depends on the platform you build. Your RSUs appreciate when you ship Asia integrations. This direct link between engineering output and equity value is your most powerful compensation lever.
3. **First-mover career advantage**: Being the engineer who builds dLocal's Asia platform creates a career moat. No other engineer in the world will have built a cross-continental EM payment platform for a NASDAQ-listed company. This career scarcity value should be factored into total compensation.
4. **Talent market leverage**: EM platform engineering talent is the scarcest engineering specialization in fintech. Every major payment company — Stripe, Adyen, PayPal, Block — is trying to build EM capabilities and competing for engineers with this expertise. Your market alternatives are abundant and well-compensated.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Cross-Continental Platform Architecture Ownership**
> "I'm designing and building dLocal's payment platform across two continents — LatAm and Asia — spanning 50+ emerging markets, 200+ local payment methods, and dozens of regulatory jurisdictions. This is the most complex payment platform architecture challenge in fintech. No other company on NASDAQ offers this scope. I need compensation at the Principal/Distinguished engineer level to reflect this unique architectural ownership."

**Lever 2: JP Morgan Bull Case Direct Attribution**
> "JP Morgan's Feb 11 bull case thesis explicitly depends on platform scalability and Asia market entry speed — both of which are my direct deliverables. My RSU grant should be sized to reflect that my engineering output is what JP Morgan is betting on. I want a grant that rewards me proportionally for the stock price appreciation my Asia platform work creates."

**Lever 3: NASDAQ Pure-Play EM Equity Scarcity**
> "DLO is the only pure-play EM payments equity on NASDAQ. There is no comparable public equity alternative. My RSU grant should reflect both the scarcity premium of DLO stock and my role as the engineer who builds the platform that justifies that scarcity premium. I'm asking for a grant at the top of the Staff/Principal band."

**Lever 4: EM Platform Engineering Talent Market**
> "I am one of fewer than 100 engineers globally who have built cross-continental emerging market payment platform infrastructure. Stripe, Adyen, PayPal, Block, and Nubank are all competing for this talent profile at $400K-$600K total comp. My dLocal offer must be competitive with these alternatives — adjusted for DLO equity upside."

**Lever 5: First-Mover Asia Infrastructure Architect**
> "The payment platform architecture I design for Asia in 2026 will process billions of dollars in transactions for the next decade. These founding-level architectural decisions create permanent competitive advantage. I'd like compensation that reflects this founding-level impact — including a signing bonus, accelerated vesting, and milestone-based RSU grants."

**Lever 6: Career Opportunity Cost Premium**
> "Taking this role means dedicating the most productive years of my career to building EM payment infrastructure. While my peers at FAANG companies work on well-trodden problems with established compensation bands, I'm taking on the unique challenge of building cross-continental payment infrastructure from scratch. I need compensation that reflects this career bet — base salary at the top of market plus RSU grants that provide meaningful upside."

**Lever 7: Dual-Continent Regulatory Compliance Engineering**
> "My platform must encode and enforce financial regulatory requirements across 50+ countries on two continents — from Brazil's BACEN rules to India's RBI mandates to Indonesia's OJK regulations. This regulatory compliance engineering scope is unique in the industry and requires deep domain expertise that takes years to develop. My compensation should reflect this irreplaceable institutional knowledge."

**Lever 8: Revenue Infrastructure Ownership**
> "Every dollar of dLocal's revenue flows through infrastructure that I design, build, and maintain. The payment routing engine, settlement system, and FX infrastructure that I own are the revenue infrastructure of the company. My total compensation should reflect that my engineering decisions directly determine dLocal's revenue capacity, processing efficiency, and ultimately its top-line growth."

**Montevideo Negotiation Script**: "As dLocal's HQ market, Montevideo is where the core platform decisions are made. My compensation should reflect that I'm a Staff/Principal-level engineer at the company's headquarters, building the platform that defines dLocal's competitive position. I'm asking for UYU 4,300,000 base and UYU 15,200,000 in RSUs over four years, with a UYU 900,000 signing bonus."

---

#### RSU Strategy — SIGNATURE ROLE Specific

As the **SIGNATURE ROLE** at dLocal, the EM Platform Engineer should negotiate RSUs with the following specific provisions:

1. **Above-band initial grant**: Request an initial RSU grant at 120-150% of the standard Staff Engineer band, justified by the cross-continental scope and JPM bull case attribution.

2. **Milestone-based refresh grants**: Negotiate annual RSU refresh grants tied to Asia platform milestones — each new Asian market launched, each payment method integrated, each settlement system deployed. This aligns your equity growth with the company's Asia expansion timeline.

3. **Accelerated vesting on Asia milestones**: Request that a portion of your RSUs vest on an accelerated schedule tied to Asia platform launch dates — e.g., 25% of your grant vests when the first 3 Asian markets go live, regardless of time-based cliff.

4. **Anti-dilution protection**: As a SIGNATURE ROLE holder, request language that your RSU refresh grants will maintain your equity percentage relative to the company's outstanding shares, protecting against dilution from future fundraising.

5. **Double-trigger acceleration**: Ensure your RSU grant includes double-trigger acceleration on change of control — if dLocal is acquired and you are terminated, 100% of your unvested RSUs immediately vest.

---

#### Alternative Offer Benchmarking (SIGNATURE ROLE Comparison)

| Company | Role | Base | RSU/yr | Total Comp | Notes |
|---------|------|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Stripe | Staff Platform Eng | $280K | $220K | $500K+ | Developed market focus, less EM scope |
| Adyen | Principal Engineer | $260K | $180K | $440K+ | Global but not EM-specialized |
| PayPal | Staff Engineer | $250K | $200K | $450K+ | Legacy platform, less greenfield |
| Mercado Pago | Principal Eng | $240K | $160K | $400K+ | LatAm only, no Asia |
| Nubank | Staff Engineer | $220K | $140K | $360K+ | Brazil focus, limited cross-border |
| Block | Staff Platform Eng | $270K | $210K | $480K+ | Developed market primary |

**Key insight for negotiation**: None of these alternatives offer the combination of (1) pure-play EM equity, (2) cross-continental platform scope, and (3) Asia first-mover position that dLocal provides. Use these offers to establish a comp floor, then negotiate above it using the EM and Asia levers unique to dLocal.

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: This is the SIGNATURE ROLE — negotiate accordingly. In New York, start at $290,000 base + $265,000 RSU/yr (4yr vest) + $75,000 signing bonus. Accept no lower than $235,000 base + $170,000 RSU/yr + $40,000 signing bonus. In São Paulo, start at R$580,000 base + R$480,000 RSU/yr + R$120,000 signing bonus. Accept no lower than R$430,000 base + R$310,000 RSU/yr + R$60,000 signing bonus. In Montevideo, start at UYU 4,300,000 base + UYU 3,800,000 RSU/yr + UYU 900,000 signing bonus. Accept no lower than UYU 3,200,000 base + UYU 2,300,000 RSU/yr + UYU 450,000 signing bonus. Always negotiate milestone-based RSU refresh grants tied to Asia market launches, accelerated vesting on Asia platform milestones, and annual refresh grants of at least 60% of the initial grant. This is the role that builds the platform JP Morgan is betting on — price it accordingly.
