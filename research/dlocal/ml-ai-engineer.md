### ML/AI Engineer — dLocal Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes dLocal's Asia Priority strategy, translating the Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot and Feb 11 JPM Bull Case into an ML/AI engineering compensation framework spanning Montevideo, São Paulo, and New York markets. ML/AI Engineers at dLocal build the intelligence layer of the emerging market payment platform — from fraud detection and payment routing optimization to approval rate models that must perform across Asia's diverse payment ecosystems.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇾 Montevideo (UYU) | UYU 2,200,000 - 3,600,000 | UYU 1,400,000 - 3,000,000 | UYU 3,600,000 - 6,600,000 |
| 🇧🇷 São Paulo (BRL) | R$300,000 - R$450,000 | R$190,000 - R$380,000 | R$490,000 - R$830,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $170,000 - $240,000 | $100,000 - $200,000 | $270,000 - $440,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers at dLocal solve problems that no other fintech can replicate — building machine learning models that operate across 40+ emerging markets with different data distributions, fraud patterns, and payment method behaviors. The Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot doubles the model complexity: Asian payment methods (UPI, GCash, PromptPay, QRIS) have fundamentally different transaction patterns than LatAm methods, requiring new model architectures and training strategies. The Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case depends on dLocal achieving competitive approval rates and fraud detection in Asian markets — both are ML/AI deliverables. With dLocal's unique multi-continental emerging market dataset, ML/AI Engineers build models that no competitor can replicate, creating exceptional compensation leverage.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| dLocal Level | Equivalent | Ebanx | Mercado Pago | PagSeguro |
|-------------|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| ML Eng | ML/AI Engineer | Data Analyst | ML Eng (L4) | ML Engineer |
| Senior ML | Senior ML Eng | Senior Analyst | Senior ML (L5) | Senior ML |
| Staff ML | Staff / Lead ML | Lead Analytics | Staff ML (L6) | Lead ML |

ML/AI roles at dLocal carry more responsibility than equivalents at Ebanx (which has minimal ML capability) or PagSeguro (which focuses on domestic fraud models). dLocal ML Engineers build models for the most diverse financial dataset in emerging market fintech, spanning multiple products and 50+ countries across two continents. Benchmark against Stripe ML and Nubank ML compensation.

#### 🌏 dLocal Asia Priority & Emerging Market Lever

The **Jan 2026 Asia Strategic Pivot** makes ML/AI the critical success factor for dLocal's Asia expansion. Payment approval rates, fraud detection accuracy, and routing optimization in new Asian markets are all ML-driven KPIs. Building models that perform well in Asian markets — where transaction patterns, fraud vectors, and consumer behaviors differ substantially from LatAm — requires sophisticated domain adaptation, transfer learning, and multi-market model architectures.

The **Feb 11, 2026 JP Morgan Bull Case** update depends on dLocal achieving competitive KPIs in Asian markets. Approval rates, fraud rates, and payment routing efficiency are the operational metrics that determine whether dLocal can win merchant volume in Asia. All three are ML/AI-optimized metrics. JP Morgan's bull case is essentially a bet on dLocal's ML/AI capability to generalize across continents.

dLocal's **Emerging Market** ML advantage is its proprietary multi-market dataset. Years of processing payments across 18+ LatAm markets have generated training data that captures the unique patterns of EM payment behavior. As dLocal enters Asia, ML Engineers can apply transfer learning from LatAm patterns to bootstrap Asian market models — a data advantage that neither Stripe nor Adyen can replicate with their developed-market-focused datasets.

For ML/AI Engineers specifically, the Asia expansion means building fraud detection models for Asian payment methods, creating approval rate optimization engines for Asian acquiring banks, developing multi-market routing models that dynamically select the best processing path across Asian payment networks, and designing model monitoring systems that detect performance degradation across dozens of markets simultaneously. This cross-continental ML scope is exceptionally rare.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Cross-Continental Model Complexity**
> "I build models that must perform across 50+ emerging markets on two continents, with fundamentally different data distributions. This requires transfer learning, multi-domain adaptation, and real-time inference across dozens of payment ecosystems. This complexity warrants Staff ML compensation."

**Lever 2: Revenue-Critical Model Ownership**
> "My approval rate and routing optimization models directly determine dLocal's revenue per transaction across all Asian markets. Every percentage point of approval rate improvement translates to millions in revenue — the core metric that JP Morgan's Feb 11 bull case depends on."

**Lever 3: Proprietary EM ML Dataset**
> "dLocal's multi-year, multi-continent emerging market payment dataset is a proprietary asset that no competitor can replicate. My expertise with this dataset — and my ability to apply transfer learning from LatAm to bootstrap Asian market models — creates irreplaceable institutional knowledge."

**Lever 4: ML Talent Market Competition**
> "ML/AI Engineers with financial services expertise and emerging market experience are among the scarcest talent profiles in tech. I have active interest from Stripe, Nubank, Mercado Pago, and major tech companies at total comp packages of $350K-$500K. My dLocal package must be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In New York, start at $235,000 base + $190,000 RSU/yr (4yr vest). Accept no lower than $180,000 base + $115,000 RSU/yr. In São Paulo, start at R$440,000 base + R$370,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than R$320,000 base + R$210,000 RSU/yr. In Montevideo, start at UYU 3,500,000 base + UYU 2,800,000 RSU/yr, accept no lower than UYU 2,500,000 base + UYU 1,600,000 RSU/yr. Negotiate ML compute budget, conference attendance, and RSU grants tied to model performance metrics (approval rate improvement, fraud rate reduction across Asian markets).
