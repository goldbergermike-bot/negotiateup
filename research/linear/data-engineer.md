### Data Engineer | Linear Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Project Management Reimagined | 2026 Focus: AI-Powered Project Analytics Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$210K | $110K–$230K | 5–10% | $215K–$310K |
| New York | $165K–$210K | $110K–$230K | 5–10% | $215K–$310K |
| London | £125K–£160K | £84K–£175K | 5–10% | £164K–£236K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Linear build the analytics infrastructure that powers both internal product intelligence and customer-facing insights — from the data pipelines processing millions of project management events across thousands of teams to the analytics systems that inform product decisions and the data foundation for Linear's AI capabilities. At Linear's scale — thousands of engineering teams managing millions of issues and tracking billions of workflow events — the data engineering challenge is uniquely rich: you have access to the most comprehensive dataset of how high-performing engineering teams actually work.

Linear's Data Engineer compensation reflects the company's growth-stage positioning and the strategic importance of data infrastructure for the AI roadmap. Base salaries reach $210K with equity grants of $110K–$230K. The negotiation leverage for data engineers comes from the dual value of your work: the pipelines you build power both customer-facing analytics (a revenue feature) and the AI model training infrastructure (Linear's strategic future).

**Level Mapping:** Linear Data Engineer = Google L4 Data Engineer = Meta E4 Data Engineer = Notion Data Engineer = Asana Data Engineer

### AI-Powered Project Analytics Infrastructure Lever
Linear's 2026 data engineering priority is building the infrastructure that powers AI project intelligence — training data pipelines for project prediction models, feature stores for intelligent workflow suggestions, and real-time analytics that feed AI-powered project insights. Data Engineers who bring ML pipeline experience alongside traditional data engineering skills are positioned to own the data foundation for Linear's AI transformation.

Negotiate the AI-analytics infrastructure premium: building pipelines that serve both customer analytics dashboards and AI model training is a dual-purpose infrastructure challenge that commands a 10–15% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Project Management Data Expertise:** "I've built data infrastructure for workflow and productivity platforms — processing event streams, building analytics, and modeling team behavior. I'm targeting $205K base and $220K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Training Data Infrastructure:** "I build data pipelines that serve both analytics and ML model training — the exact infrastructure Linear needs for AI-powered project intelligence. I want $210K base."
3. **Real-Time Event Processing:** "I've designed real-time data pipelines processing millions of events — the scale of Linear's project management telemetry. I'm looking for $210K base and $225K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Notion Data Engineering is offering $200K / $210K equity. Asana is at $195K / $200K RSU. Linear's AI data infrastructure opportunity and per-capita equity impact are compelling, but I need $205K base and $220K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Linear's project management data is uniquely valuable — it represents how the best engineering teams in the world actually work. I'm holding a Notion offer at $200K / $210K equity and an Asana offer at $195K / $200K RSU. Linear's AI intelligence strategy and the chance to build the data infrastructure that powers it are what differentiate this role. I need $210K base, $225K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $210K, I commit. My floor is $190K — below that, Notion's established data infrastructure and competitive equity win."
