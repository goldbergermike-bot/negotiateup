### Product Manager | Linear Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strategy-Premium Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Project Management Reimagined | 2026 Focus: AI-Native Project Management Product Strategy

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $170K–$225K | $150K–$310K | 10–15% | $265K–$390K |
| New York | $170K–$225K | $150K–$310K | 10–15% | $265K–$390K |
| London | £130K–£171K | £114K–£236K | 10–15% | £202K–£297K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Linear own the strategy for the project management tool that thousands of engineering teams have chosen as the gold standard — and the responsibility of maintaining that position while expanding into AI-powered capabilities. This is an unusually high-bar PM role: your users are product managers and engineering leaders who are themselves experts in product strategy and project management. Every product decision is evaluated by people who deeply understand the craft of building software. You'll work directly with co-founders who have strong product opinions, navigate a community of passionate users, and balance the simplicity that defines Linear with the depth that enterprise teams demand.

Linear PM compensation reaches $225K base with equity grants of $150K–$310K. The negotiation leverage for PMs comes from demonstrating the rare combination of product craft sensibility, technical depth, and understanding of engineering team workflows. PMs who can also define Linear's AI product strategy hold the strongest hand — the company's future depends on getting AI right without compromising the product's elegant simplicity.

### AI-Native Project Management Product Strategy Lever
Linear's 2026 product strategy is defined by AI-native project management — AI that makes project management happen automatically, reducing the overhead that engineering managers spend on tracking, updating, and reporting. PMs who can define this AI product vision without compromising Linear's signature simplicity are the most critical product hires. This means understanding what AI should automate versus what should remain human-driven, designing AI features that feel like magic rather than complexity, and navigating the trust equation of AI-powered project predictions.

Position yourself as a PM who can make AI simple: at Linear, the product philosophy is that the best tool is invisible. Applying this philosophy to AI features requires exceptional product judgment.

**Global Levers**
1. **Project Management Product Expertise:** "I've led product strategy for productivity tools used by engineering teams — understanding workflow optimization, cognitive load reduction, and tool adoption. I'm targeting $220K base and $295K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Product Strategy Premium:** "I've shipped AI-powered productivity products — defining capabilities that reduce overhead without adding complexity. Linear's AI vision needs this product judgment. I want $225K base."
3. **Craft-Product Philosophy:** "I build products with the craft sensibility and simplicity that define Linear — every feature earns its place, every interaction is intentional. I'm looking for $220K base and $300K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Notion PM is offering $215K / $280K equity. Asana PM is at $210K / $260K RSU. Linear's craft culture and AI product strategy are more compelling, but I need $220K base and $295K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've built my PM career around the principle that the best tool is invisible — exactly Linear's product philosophy. I'm holding a Notion PM offer at $215K / $280K equity and an Asana PM at $210K / $260K RSU. Linear's craft culture and the chance to define AI-native project management are uniquely compelling. I need $225K base, $300K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. At $225K, I'm ready to lead. My floor is $205K — below that, Notion's established market position and competitive equity become the safer bet."
