### Engineering Manager | Linear Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Leadership-Premium Base + Significant Pre-IPO Equity | Project Management Reimagined | 2026 Focus: Scaling Craft-Quality AI Engineering Teams

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $215K–$270K | $260K–$480K | 10–15% | $345K–$505K |
| New York | $215K–$270K | $260K–$480K | 10–15% | $345K–$505K |
| London | £164K–£205K | £198K–£365K | 10–15% | £262K–£384K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Linear lead teams building the project management tool that's replaced Jira at thousands of the world's best engineering organizations. This is an unusually high-bar EM role: Linear's engineering culture is defined by craft quality and minimal process, meaning the EM must maintain the team's exceptional quality standard while fostering the autonomy and ownership that make Linear's culture work. You'll manage a team of elite engineers who chose Linear specifically for its craft culture, navigate the tension between shipping fast and shipping perfectly, and work directly with co-founders who are deeply involved in product and technical decisions.

EM compensation at Linear reaches $270K base with equity grants of $260K–$480K. Given Linear's small team, the per-capita equity impact of an EM hire is substantial. The negotiation leverage comes from demonstrating the ability to lead high-performance, craft-oriented teams without introducing the process overhead that Linear's culture explicitly rejects.

**Level Mapping:** Linear EM = Google M1 = Meta M1 = Notion Engineering Manager = Figma Engineering Manager

### Scaling Craft-Quality AI Engineering Teams Lever
Linear's 2026 organizational priority is building the engineering team that can ship AI-native project intelligence features at Linear's quality bar. This means recruiting engineers who combine AI/ML skills with craft-quality frontend expertise, establishing AI development workflows that don't slow down Linear's shipping velocity, and maintaining the culture of minimal process and maximum ownership. EMs who can build AI-capable teams in craft-oriented cultures are Linear's most critical leadership hire.

Position yourself as a leader who can recruit AI talent without diluting craft culture. This combination is rare — most AI teams operate in research-oriented cultures that don't prioritize user experience craft. Managers who can bridge both worlds command a 15–20% equity premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Craft-Culture Team Leadership:** "I've led engineering teams that maintain exceptional craft quality while shipping at high velocity — exactly Linear's cultural balance. I'm targeting $265K base and $460K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Team Building Premium:** "I've built teams shipping AI-powered products at consumer-quality standards. Linear's AI intelligence strategy needs this specific leadership. I want $270K base."
3. **Small-Team High-Impact Management:** "I've managed small, elite engineering teams where every hire matters disproportionately — exactly Linear's team structure. I'm looking for $265K base and $470K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Spread:** "Notion EM is offering $255K / $420K equity. Figma EM is at $260K / $450K equity. Linear's craft culture and small-team impact are uniquely compelling, but I need $265K base, $460K equity, and a $55K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've built and led engineering teams that maintain craft quality at speed — the exact cultural balance that defines Linear. I'm holding a Notion EM offer at $255K / $420K equity and a Figma EM at $260K / $450K equity. Linear's craft culture, small-team impact, and the chance to build the AI engineering organization are what I want to invest in. I need $270K base, $470K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $55K signing bonus. At $270K, I start building. My floor is $250K — below that, Figma's larger team and equity win."
