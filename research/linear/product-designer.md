### Product Designer | Linear Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Design-Premium Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Project Management Reimagined | 2026 Focus: AI-Augmented Project Workflows

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$210K | $120K–$240K | 5–10% | $215K–$315K |
| New York | $160K–$210K | $120K–$240K | 5–10% | $215K–$315K |
| London | £122K–£160K | £91K–£183K | 5–10% | £164K–£240K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Linear shape the design of the project management tool that's become the industry gold standard for interface quality. Linear's entire competitive identity is built on design craft — the animations, transitions, keyboard shortcuts, and information architecture are what make teams switch from Jira. Designing for Linear means meeting the highest possible bar: your users are designers and engineers who evaluate every interaction through the lens of professional craft. Every pixel, animation curve, and interaction pattern you design is visible to and scrutinized by the most design-literate user base in productivity software.

Linear's Product Designer compensation reaches $210K base with equity grants of $120K–$240K. Linear's CEO Karri Saarinen is a designer, which means design is a core strategic function with direct executive advocacy. The negotiation leverage for designers comes from Linear's design-led identity: the product's design quality IS the competitive moat, making every designer a strategic hire. Designers with a portfolio of productivity tool design or interaction design at Linear's craft standard hold significant leverage.

### AI-Augmented Project Workflows Lever
Linear's 2026 design vision centers on AI-augmented project management workflows — designing interfaces where AI assistance feels natural, unobtrusive, and genuinely helpful. Product Designers who understand how to integrate AI into high-craft productivity interfaces (making AI feel like a natural extension of the tool, not an overlay) are the scarcest design talent Linear needs.

Position yourself as a designer who can make AI invisible: at Linear, the best AI feature is one that helps without being noticed. Designing this level of AI integration requires deep understanding of workflow psychology, attention management, and interface trust.

**Global Levers**
1. **Craft-Standard Interaction Design:** "I design at the craft standard Linear is known for — 60fps interactions, keyboard-first patterns, and information-dense interfaces that feel effortless. I'm targeting $205K base and $230K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Interaction Design Premium:** "I've designed AI-augmented workflows — making AI assistance feel natural and unobtrusive in productivity tools. Linear's AI integration needs this expertise. I want $210K base."
3. **Productivity Tool Design Expertise:** "I've designed productivity tools used by engineering teams — understanding workflow patterns, cognitive load, and efficiency optimization. I'm looking for $205K base and $235K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Notion Design is offering $200K / $220K equity. Figma is at $205K / $240K equity. Linear's design-led culture and the AI workflow design challenge are compelling, but I need $205K base and $230K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I design productivity interfaces at the craft standard that defines Linear — and I'm excited about the challenge of integrating AI into that experience seamlessly. I'm holding a Notion offer at $200K / $220K equity and a Figma offer at $205K / $240K equity. Linear's design-led culture (CEO is a designer!) and the AI workflow design challenge are uniquely compelling. I need $210K base, $235K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $210K, I'm in. My floor is $190K — below that, Figma's design-tool mission and equity win."
