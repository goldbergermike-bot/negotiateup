### Staff Software Engineer | Linear Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** High Base + Major Pre-IPO Equity | Project Management Reimagined | 2026 Focus: AI-Native Project Platform Architecture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $245K–$305K | $380K–$650K | 10–15% | $400K–$585K |
| New York | $245K–$305K | $380K–$650K | 10–15% | $400K–$585K |
| London | £186K–£232K | £289K–£494K | 10–15% | £304K–£445K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Staff Software Engineers at Linear are the technical leaders of the entire product — in a team of 50-70 engineers, a Staff engineer effectively serves as the principal architect. You define the multi-year technical vision, make foundational architectural decisions that shape the product's performance and scalability, and set the craft standard that the entire engineering team follows. At Linear, the Staff level also involves working closely with co-founders Karri Saarinen (CEO, also a designer) and Tuomas Artman (CTO) to translate product vision into technical strategy. Your influence extends across the entire codebase and every product surface.

Staff-level compensation at Linear reaches $305K base with equity grants of $380K–$650K. Given the small team size, these equity grants represent substantially more per-capita ownership than comparable grants at companies with 500+ engineer teams. The negotiation dynamic at Staff is highly personalized — Linear's CTO is directly involved in every Staff hire, and the expectation is that each Staff engineer fundamentally elevates the technical capability of the entire team.

### AI-Native Project Platform Architecture Lever
In 2026, Linear's Staff Engineers are architecting the foundational AI systems that make the platform genuinely intelligent — not just adding AI features, but rethinking project management through an AI-native lens. This means designing the data models, inference pipelines, and real-time AI systems that make every interaction with Linear smarter. Staff-level hires who can own this architectural vision while maintaining Linear's craft standard are the company's most critical investment.

Leverage this by positioning yourself as an architect who can make AI invisible: at Linear, the best AI feature is one the user never consciously invokes. This design philosophy for AI architecture is extraordinarily rare and commands premium equity grants.

**Global Levers**
1. **Platform Architecture Vision:** "At Staff level in Linear's team, I'm effectively the principal architect. That level of technical influence over a product used by thousands of engineering teams justifies $300K base and $620K equity/4yr."
2. **AI-Native Architecture Mastery:** "I've architected AI-native products — not AI bolted onto existing systems, but products rebuilt from the ground up with intelligence as a core capability. Linear's 2026 AI vision needs this approach. I want $305K base and $640K equity."
3. **Craft-Scale Architecture:** "I build systems that scale while maintaining craft quality — the fundamental engineering tension at Linear. I'm targeting $300K base and $630K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offers:** "Notion Staff is offering $290K / $550K equity. Figma Staff is at $300K / $650K equity. Linear's product vision and the per-capita impact of a Staff role on a small team are uniquely compelling, but I need $300K base, $630K equity, and a $70K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've spent my career building craft-quality products at the architectural level — real-time systems, performance-obsessed interfaces, and now AI-native platform architecture. Linear's Staff role on a small, elite team is the highest-impact opportunity in productivity software. I'm holding a Notion Staff offer at $290K / $550K equity and a Figma Staff at $300K / $650K equity. Linear's craft culture and the chance to architect AI-native project intelligence from the ground up are what I want. I need $305K base, $640K equity/4yr with 40% year-one vesting, and a $75K signing bonus. At $305K, I commit to defining Linear's technical future. My floor is $280K — below that, Figma's larger equity and platform scale become the better bet."
