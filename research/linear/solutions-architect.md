**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Linear are the technical bridge between the platform and enterprise engineering organizations — helping teams migrate from Jira, design workflow architectures that leverage Linear's unique capabilities, and ensure that enterprise customers' integration, security, and compliance requirements are met. This is a revenue-critical role: every enterprise deal depends on the SA's ability to demonstrate that Linear can replace the deeply-embedded tools that engineering teams currently depend on. You'll lead Jira migration projects, design integration architectures, and prove to enterprise engineering leaders that Linear's craft-quality approach scales to their organization.

Linear SA compensation reaches $220K base with equity and performance bonuses tied to enterprise deal outcomes. The negotiation leverage comes from the direct revenue impact of migrations: every enterprise team you successfully move from Jira to Linear directly increases ARR and validates the company's enterprise strategy.

**Level Mapping:** Linear Solutions Architect = Google Customer Engineer = Atlassian Solutions Architect = Notion Enterprise Solutions = Asana Solutions Architect

### AI-Powered Enterprise Project Migration Lever
Linear's 2026 enterprise strategy includes AI-powered migration tooling — using LLMs to analyze Jira instances, generate migration plans, map custom workflows to Linear patterns, and automate the transition process. Solutions Architects who can leverage AI to accelerate enterprise migrations are the most valuable SAs. If you can demonstrate experience using AI to streamline project management tool migrations, you hold differentiated leverage.

Position yourself as an SA who reduces enterprise migration time using AI: faster migrations mean faster deals, happier customers, and higher conversion rates.

**Global Levers**
1. **Jira Migration Expertise:** "I've led large-scale enterprise Jira migrations — the exact customer journey Linear's enterprise team facilitates. I'm targeting $215K base and $250K equity/4yr."
2. **Enterprise Engineering Workflow Design:** "I've designed project management workflows for enterprise engineering organizations — understanding how teams at scale manage work. I want $220K base."
3. **AI-Powered Migration Premium:** "I leverage AI tools to accelerate enterprise migrations — automated workflow analysis, AI-generated migration plans, and intelligent configuration recommendations. I'm looking for $220K base and $255K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Atlassian SA is offering $210K / $240K RSU. Notion Enterprise is at $205K / $230K equity. Linear's enterprise growth and per-capita equity are compelling, but I need $215K base and $250K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've spent my career helping enterprise engineering teams adopt better project management tools — leading Jira migrations, designing workflows, and proving that a better tool is worth the switch. I'm holding an Atlassian SA offer at $210K / $240K RSU and a Notion Enterprise offer at $205K / $230K equity. Linear's product quality and enterprise growth trajectory are what differentiate this opportunity. I need $220K base, $255K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $220K, I start closing enterprise deals. My floor is $200K — below that, Atlassian's enterprise scale and liquid equity make the decision."
