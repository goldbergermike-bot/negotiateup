### Data Scientist | Linear Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Project Management Reimagined | 2026 Focus: AI-Driven Team Performance Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$215K | $110K–$240K | 5–10% | $218K–$320K |
| New York | $165K–$215K | $110K–$240K | 5–10% | $218K–$320K |
| London | £125K–£164K | £84K–£183K | 5–10% | £166K–£244K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Linear analyze the most comprehensive dataset of engineering team performance in the world — millions of issues, thousands of sprints, and billions of workflow events from the best engineering teams globally. You'll model team productivity patterns, optimize product-led growth funnels, build predictive models for project outcomes, and quantify the impact of new features (including AI capabilities) on team efficiency. At Linear, data science directly shapes both the product (what features to build) and the AI strategy (what intelligence to embed).

Linear's Data Scientist compensation reaches $215K base with equity grants of $110K–$240K. The negotiation angle for data scientists centers on the unique richness of Linear's dataset: no other company has this depth of data on how engineering teams manage projects, estimate work, and track velocity. If you can demonstrate experience with team analytics, productivity modeling, or engineering metrics, you hold differentiated leverage.

### AI-Driven Team Performance Intelligence Lever
Linear's 2026 data science agenda focuses on AI-driven team intelligence — building ML models that predict project timelines, identify productivity bottlenecks, and provide intelligent recommendations to engineering managers. Data Scientists who can bridge product analytics with ML modeling for team performance are positioned to lead this initiative. This means building models that understand team dynamics, project complexity, and workflow patterns — a fundamentally different analytical challenge from consumer product analytics.

Negotiate the team-intelligence premium: data scientists who can model engineering team behavior and build intelligence that improves how teams work are creating a new category of analytical capability. This novelty commands a 10–15% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Team Performance Analytics:** "I've built models analyzing team productivity, project estimation accuracy, and workflow efficiency. This domain-specific expertise directly maps to Linear's intelligence features. I'm targeting $210K base and $230K equity/4yr."
2. **ML-Powered Product Intelligence:** "I build ML models that ship as product features — predictions, recommendations, and intelligent automation. I want $215K base."
3. **Engineering Metrics Expertise:** "I have deep experience with engineering metrics — velocity, cycle time, throughput, and quality indicators. This analytical foundation powers Linear's insights features. I'm looking for $210K base and $235K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Spread:** "Notion DS is offering $205K / $220K equity. Asana DS is at $200K / $210K RSU. Linear's unique dataset and AI intelligence strategy are more compelling, but I need $210K base and $230K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Linear's dataset is unlike anything in tech — the world's best engineering teams managing projects in real-time. I'm holding a Notion DS offer at $205K / $220K equity and an Asana offer at $200K / $210K RSU. Linear's AI-driven team intelligence strategy and the chance to build models on this unique data are what differentiate this role. I need $215K base, $235K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $215K, I commit. My floor is $195K — below that, Notion's data scale and equity win."
