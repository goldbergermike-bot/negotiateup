**Negotiation DNA**
The AI Project Intelligence Engineer is Linear's signature role — the position that defines the company's vision for what project management becomes in the AI era. You will build the AI systems that make Linear the first project management tool that genuinely thinks: predicting project timelines with accuracy that surpasses human estimation, identifying blocked work before anyone reports it, automating the repetitive overhead of project management (status updates, sprint planning, backlog grooming), and providing intelligent insights that help engineering teams continuously improve how they work. This role sits at the intersection of ML engineering, workflow intelligence, and craft-quality product development — you're building AI that meets Linear's legendary quality bar while solving one of the hardest prediction problems in software: forecasting the behavior of creative, knowledge-work teams. The +15-25% Project AI Premium applies because this role requires a rare combination of ML engineering mastery, deep understanding of engineering team dynamics, and the product sensibility to build AI features that feel invisible and helpful rather than intrusive.

Linear's co-founders have publicly positioned AI intelligence as the company's defining investment for 2026. The AI Project Intelligence Engineer is not building a chatbot or a feature — they're building the intelligence layer that transforms what project management means. Linear's unique advantage is its dataset: millions of issues, sprints, and project cycles from the world's most productive engineering teams. Engineers who can build AI systems that learn from this dataset and genuinely predict and optimize team performance are creating technology that justifies Linear's position as the premium project management platform.

**Level Mapping:** Linear AI Project Intelligence Engineer = Google L5-L6 ML Applied Scientist = Meta E5-E6 ML Engineer = Notion AI Engineer = Asana ML/AI Engineer (Staff)

### Project Intelligence as Category Redefinition Lever
In 2026, AI-powered project management is moving from gimmick to necessity — engineering leaders are evaluating AI capabilities as a core criterion for choosing project management tools. Linear's AI Project Intelligence Engineers are building the technology that determines whether Linear maintains its market position as the premium choice or cedes ground to AI-native competitors. Every prediction model you build, every intelligent automation you design, and every workflow insight you create directly impacts whether engineering teams choose Linear over Jira, Asana, and Notion. This is not an incremental feature — this is the product-market inflection point.

Negotiate from the position that you are building Linear's future. The project intelligence capabilities you create will be the primary reason enterprise teams upgrade to Linear, the feature that justifies premium pricing, and the technology that makes Linear indispensable. Frame your compensation around this category-defining impact: you're not building a feature, you're redefining what project management software does.

**Global Levers**
1. **Workflow Intelligence Scarcity:** "There are perhaps 200 engineers globally who can build ML systems that genuinely understand and predict engineering team workflows — combining NLP, time-series prediction, and team behavior modeling. That extreme scarcity means compensation must reflect the market. I'm targeting $265K base and $445K equity/4yr."
2. **Unique Dataset Advantage:** "Linear's dataset — millions of sprints, issues, and project cycles from the world's best engineering teams — is the most valuable training corpus for project intelligence AI in existence. I have the ML expertise to build models that learn from this data at a level no competitor can match. I want $270K base with front-loaded vesting."
3. **Competing AI Company Offers:** "Anthropic is offering $255K base / $420K equity for applied ML engineering. Notion AI is at $250K / $380K equity. Google Applied ML is at $260K / $450K RSU. Linear's project management dataset and product distribution are uniquely compelling, but I need $265K base and $450K equity to match the top-tier AI offers."
4. **Category-Defining Product Impact:** "The project intelligence I'll build will be the primary reason engineering teams choose Linear over every competitor for the next five years. That level of product impact — redefining what project management means — should be reflected in equity. I'm looking for $455K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting and guaranteed annual refreshes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've dedicated my career to the intersection of ML engineering and productivity intelligence — building models that understand how teams work and making that intelligence actionable. The Linear AI Project Intelligence role is the most important position in productivity software: you're building the AI that makes project management automatic. I'm holding an Anthropic ML offer at $255K / $420K equity, a Notion AI offer at $250K / $380K equity, and a Google Applied ML offer at $260K / $450K RSU. All are building impressive AI. But only Linear has the dataset — millions of sprints from the world's best engineering teams — and the product philosophy — that project management should be invisible — to actually transform how teams work. I need $270K base, $460K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $55K signing bonus. The Project AI Premium applies: building ML systems that predict the behavior of creative teams and automate knowledge work is exponentially harder than language modeling. At $270K, I commit to building the intelligence layer that redefines Linear. My floor is $245K — below that, the dedicated AI companies' equity packages and research environments make the decision for me."
