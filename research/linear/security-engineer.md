**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Linear protect the platform where thousands of engineering teams manage their most sensitive project data — product roadmaps, sprint plans, engineering priorities, and strategic initiatives that represent core competitive intelligence. This is a high-trust security role: enterprise engineering teams won't adopt Linear unless they trust it with information that reveals their technical strategy, staffing decisions, and product direction. You'll build the authentication, authorization, audit logging, and encryption systems that enterprise customers require, ensure SOC 2 and compliance certifications, and protect the real-time sync infrastructure from attack.

Linear's Security Engineer compensation reaches $235K base with equity grants of $140K–$280K. The negotiation leverage comes from the sensitivity of project management data (it reveals company strategy) and the enterprise trust that security enables. In Linear's small team, the security function has outsized responsibility — you're building the security foundation that enables enterprise sales.

**Level Mapping:** Linear Security Engineer = Google L4-L5 Security Engineer = Meta E4-E5 Security Engineer = Notion Security Engineer = Asana Security Engineer

### AI Feature Security & Enterprise Trust Lever
Linear's 2026 security priority is ensuring that AI features don't compromise project data confidentiality — that AI models don't memorize or leak strategic project information, that AI-powered automation respects access controls, and that enterprise customers can trust AI features with their most sensitive project data. Security Engineers who bring AI security expertise are the highest-priority security hires as Linear expands AI capabilities.

Negotiate the AI-project-security premium: the intersection of AI security and project management data protection (where the data reveals company strategy) is an extremely sensitive and narrow expertise commanding a 15–20% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **SaaS Application Security:** "I've built security architectures for multi-tenant SaaS platforms processing sensitive enterprise data. I'm targeting $230K base and $270K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Security Premium:** "I have experience securing AI features — preventing model memorization, protecting training data, and ensuring AI outputs respect access controls. This is critical for Linear's AI rollout. I want $235K base."
3. **Enterprise Compliance Expertise:** "I've led SOC 2 and enterprise security programs for productivity platforms with Fortune 500 customers. Linear's enterprise sales depend on these. I'm looking for $230K base and $275K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Spread:** "Notion Security is offering $225K / $260K equity. Google Security L4 is at $220K / $260K RSU. Linear's unique security challenges and per-capita equity impact are compelling, but I need $230K base and $270K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I specialize in securing platforms that manage sensitive enterprise data — the exact security challenge at the heart of Linear's enterprise trust. I'm holding a Notion Security offer at $225K / $260K equity and a Google Security offer at $220K / $260K RSU. Linear's AI security challenges and the outsized impact of security in a small team are more interesting. I need $235K base, $275K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. At $235K, I commit to building Linear's security foundation. My floor is $215K — below that, Google's security resources and liquid equity win."
