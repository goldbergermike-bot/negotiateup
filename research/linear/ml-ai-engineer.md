### ML/AI Engineer | Linear Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** AI-Premium Base + Meaningful Pre-IPO Equity | Project Management Reimagined | 2026 Focus: Intelligent Project Automation & Prediction

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $190K–$250K | $180K–$360K | 5–10% | $278K–$420K |
| New York | $190K–$250K | $180K–$360K | 5–10% | $278K–$420K |
| London | £145K–£190K | £137K–£274K | 5–10% | £211K–£320K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Linear build the intelligence layer that transforms project management from a manual overhead into an automated, predictive system — from AI-powered issue triage and intelligent project estimation to natural language task creation, predictive sprint planning, and automated workflow optimization. This is a uniquely impactful ML role: your models directly reduce the friction that engineering managers and product teams experience every day, and Linear's dataset (millions of issues across the world's best engineering teams) provides training data that no other project management tool can match.

Linear's ML/AI Engineer compensation reflects the AI talent market premium combined with the company's pre-IPO equity upside. Base salaries reach $250K to compete with AI companies and Big Tech ML teams, and equity grants of $180K–$360K represent significant per-capita ownership. The negotiation dynamic is favorable for AI engineers: Linear is aggressively building its AI capabilities and the small team means each ML hire has disproportionate product impact.

**Level Mapping:** Linear ML/AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta E4-E5 ML Engineer = Notion ML Engineer = Asana ML Engineer

### Intelligent Project Automation & Prediction Lever
Linear's 2026 AI strategy centers on making project management genuinely intelligent — AI that predicts project timelines accurately, identifies blocked work before humans notice, automates repetitive project management tasks, and provides insights that help teams improve their processes. ML/AI Engineers working on this are building the features that justify Linear's premium positioning against Jira and Asana. If you bring experience with workflow automation ML, time-series prediction, or NLP for productivity tools, you're targeting Linear's highest-priority product area.

Frame your negotiation around the project-intelligence AI premium: building ML models that understand engineering team workflows and predict project outcomes is a domain-specific AI challenge with very few experienced practitioners.

**Global Levers**
1. **Productivity AI Expertise:** "I've built AI-powered productivity features — intelligent task management, predictive scheduling, and automated workflow optimization. This maps directly to Linear's intelligence vision. I'm targeting $245K base and $345K equity/4yr."
2. **NLP for Project Management:** "I have deep experience with NLP for productivity — natural language issue creation, intelligent categorization, and semantic search across project data. I want $250K base."
3. **Predictive Analytics for Teams:** "I've built predictive models for team performance — estimating project timelines, identifying bottlenecks, and forecasting resource needs. I'm looking for $250K base and $355K equity/4yr."
4. **AI Company Competing Offers:** "Notion AI is offering $240K / $320K equity. Anthropic is at $245K / $350K equity. Linear's unique project management dataset and craft-quality product culture are compelling, but I need $245K base and $350K equity to match."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've built my career at the intersection of AI and productivity tools — building models that genuinely reduce cognitive overhead and make teams more effective. Linear's dataset — millions of issues from the world's best engineering teams — is the dream training data for project intelligence AI. I'm holding a Notion AI offer at $240K / $320K equity and an Anthropic offer at $245K / $350K equity. Linear's craft culture and the chance to build AI that redefines project management are what I want. I need $250K base, $355K equity/4yr, and a $45K signing bonus. At $250K, I commit to building Linear's intelligence layer. My floor is $230K — below that, the dedicated AI companies' equity and research environments win."
