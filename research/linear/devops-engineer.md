### DevOps Engineer | Linear Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Infrastructure-Premium Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Project Management Reimagined | 2026 Focus: AI-Augmented Platform Reliability

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $170K–$220K | $120K–$250K | 5–10% | $228K–$335K |
| New York | $170K–$220K | $120K–$250K | 5–10% | $228K–$335K |
| London | £130K–£168K | £91K–£190K | 5–10% | £173K–£255K |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Linear ensure the platform's legendary speed and reliability — Linear's brand promise is that project management should be instant, and every millisecond of latency or second of downtime directly contradicts that promise. You'll manage the infrastructure that supports real-time sync for thousands of concurrent teams, build deployment pipelines for a product that ships multiple times daily, and design the observability systems that maintain Linear's sub-50ms response time guarantee. In Linear's small team, the DevOps function has outsized impact: you're personally responsible for the performance that defines the product's identity.

Linear's DevOps compensation reaches $220K base with equity grants of $120K–$250K. The negotiation leverage comes from the critical nature of performance and reliability for a product whose entire competitive positioning is built on speed. DevOps engineers who understand real-time systems performance and can maintain Linear's speed standard hold significant leverage.

### AI-Augmented Platform Reliability Lever
Linear's 2026 infrastructure vision includes AI-augmented reliability — using ML for predictive performance monitoring, intelligent capacity planning, and automated incident detection. As Linear adds AI features (which require inference infrastructure), maintaining the product's speed guarantee becomes more complex. DevOps Engineers who can scale AI inference alongside traditional application infrastructure are positioned to lead this challenge.

Negotiate the AI-infrastructure reliability premium: maintaining sub-50ms performance while adding ML inference workloads is a uniquely demanding operational challenge that commands a 10–15% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Performance-Critical Infrastructure:** "I've operated infrastructure where latency IS the product — maintaining sub-50ms response times at scale. This is Linear's core technical promise. I'm targeting $215K base and $240K equity/4yr."
2. **Real-Time Systems Reliability:** "I've managed real-time sync infrastructure — WebSocket management, sync protocol reliability, and distributed state consistency. I want $220K base."
3. **AI Inference Infrastructure:** "I've managed ML inference infrastructure alongside application workloads — ensuring AI features don't degrade core performance. This is Linear's 2026 infrastructure challenge. I'm looking for $220K base and $245K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Notion Infrastructure is offering $210K / $230K equity. Figma DevOps is at $215K / $240K equity. Linear's performance-obsessed culture and the unique challenge of maintaining speed while adding AI are compelling, but I need $215K base and $240K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I specialize in operating performance-critical infrastructure — the exact kind of systems that make Linear possible. I'm holding a Notion Infrastructure offer at $210K / $230K equity and a Figma DevOps offer at $215K / $240K equity. Linear's speed-is-the-product philosophy and the new challenge of scaling AI inference while maintaining sub-50ms latency are what make this role unique. I need $220K base, $245K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $220K, I commit. My floor is $200K — below that, Figma's larger infrastructure team and equity win."
