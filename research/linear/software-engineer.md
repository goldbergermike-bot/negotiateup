### Software Engineer | Linear Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Craft-Premium Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Project Management Reimagined | 2026 Focus: AI-Native Project Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$205K | $120K–$240K | 5–10% | $210K–$305K |
| New York | $160K–$205K | $120K–$240K | 5–10% | $210K–$305K |
| London | £122K–£156K | £91K–£183K | 5–10% | £160K–£232K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Linear build the project management tool that the best engineering teams in the world have chosen over Jira, Asana, and every other alternative — from the lightning-fast UI engine and real-time sync architecture to the keyboard-driven interaction model and the deeply integrated workflow automation. Linear's engineering culture is defined by an obsessive commitment to craft: every animation must be 60fps, every interaction must feel instant, and every feature must be thoughtfully designed. SWEs at Linear operate in a small, elite engineering team where every individual has outsized impact on the product experience.

Linear's compensation reflects its position as a well-funded growth-stage startup (valued at $1B+) with a small, selective team. Base salaries are competitive at $160K–$205K, with equity grants of $120K–$240K representing meaningful ownership given the small team size. The negotiation dynamic: Linear's small team means each hire has disproportionate impact, and the company is selective enough that getting an offer already signals strong leverage. Linear competes for talent against Notion, Figma, and Big Tech — emphasize that you bring the craft sensibility and technical depth that Linear's culture demands.

### AI-Native Project Intelligence Lever
Linear's 2026 strategic bet is AI-native project intelligence — using AI to automate project management workflows, provide intelligent project insights, predict bottlenecks, and make Linear the first project management tool that genuinely reduces the overhead of project management rather than adding to it. Software Engineers who can build AI-powered features with Linear's craft standard are the scarcest talent the company needs. If you bring experience building AI-powered productivity tools alongside exceptional frontend engineering skills, you're addressing Linear's highest-priority product initiative.

Position yourself at the intersection of AI engineering and craft-quality frontend development. Linear's AI features must feel as fast and polished as the rest of the product — an engineering challenge that few teams attempt.

**Global Levers**
1. **Craft-Quality Frontend Engineering:** "I build interfaces at the craft standard Linear is known for — 60fps animations, instant interactions, and pixel-perfect design implementation. I'm targeting $200K base and $230K equity/4yr."
2. **Real-Time Sync Architecture:** "I've built real-time collaborative systems — CRDTs, conflict resolution, and sync architecture. This is Linear's core technical foundation. I want $205K base."
3. **AI Productivity Tool Premium:** "I've built AI-powered productivity features — intelligent automation, predictive workflows, and natural language task management. Linear's AI intelligence strategy needs this. I'm looking for $205K base and $235K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Notion is offering $195K base / $220K equity. Figma is at $200K / $240K equity. Linear's craft culture and the chance to build AI-native project intelligence are more compelling, but I need $200K base and $230K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build software at the craft standard Linear is famous for — and I'm excited about bringing AI intelligence to project management while maintaining that quality bar. I'm holding a Notion offer at $195K / $220K equity and a Figma offer at $200K / $240K equity. Linear's product vision and engineering culture are where I want to be. I need $205K base, $235K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $205K, I sign this week. My floor is $185K — below that, Figma's equity and design-tool mission become the stronger offer."
