**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Linear own critical product areas end-to-end — the UI rendering engine, real-time sync layer, workflow automation system, integrations platform, or the AI intelligence capabilities. At this level in Linear's small team, you have the influence of a Staff engineer at a larger company: you set technical direction, mentor peers, and make architectural decisions that define the product. Linear's engineering team operates with minimal process overhead (they practice what they preach about reducing project management friction), meaning senior engineers have extraordinary autonomy and accountability.

Senior SWE compensation at Linear reaches $250K base with equity grants of $200K–$400K. Given Linear's small team size (~50-70 engineers), the equity represents meaningfully larger per-capita ownership than comparable grants at larger companies. The negotiation dynamic at Senior level: Linear knows that every senior hire must be exceptional — they'd rather leave the seat empty than hire someone who doesn't meet their craft and technical standard. This selectivity means that if you have an offer, you have strong leverage.

**Level Mapping:** Linear Senior SWE = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Notion Senior Engineer = Figma Senior Engineer

### AI-Native Project Intelligence Lever
Linear's 2026 senior engineering agenda centers on building AI systems that fundamentally change how teams manage projects — AI that writes issue descriptions, predicts sprint outcomes, identifies blocked work automatically, and provides intelligent project insights that reduce manager overhead. Senior Engineers who can architect AI-native features with Linear's signature craft quality are the company's most strategic hires. If you can build AI systems that are both intelligent and instantaneous, you hold unique leverage.

Frame your negotiation around the craft-AI intersection: building AI features that meet Linear's 60fps, zero-latency quality bar while also being genuinely intelligent is an extraordinarily difficult engineering challenge. Senior engineers who can solve both problems simultaneously command a 15–20% premium on equity.

**Global Levers**
1. **Craft-Quality Architecture:** "I architect systems that are both technically excellent and craft-quality — performant, elegant, and delightful to use. Linear's technical and quality bar is why I want to be here. I'm targeting $245K base and $380K equity/4yr."
2. **AI-Productivity Platform Expertise:** "I've built AI-powered productivity platforms — intelligent automation, predictive workflows, and natural language interfaces that genuinely reduce cognitive overhead. I want $250K base and $390K equity/4yr."
3. **Real-Time Systems Depth:** "I've architected real-time collaborative systems with sub-millisecond sync — the foundational infrastructure Linear's product depends on. I'm looking for $250K base."
4. **Competing Offer Spread:** "Notion Senior is offering $240K / $340K equity. Figma Senior is at $245K / $380K equity. Linear's craft culture and AI intelligence vision are what differentiate this, but I need $245K base, $380K equity, and a $45K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've spent my career building the kind of craft-quality, technically excellent software that Linear represents — real-time systems, beautiful interfaces, and now AI-powered intelligence. I'm holding a Notion Senior offer at $240K / $340K equity and a Figma Senior at $245K / $380K equity. Linear's product vision for AI-native project intelligence and the chance to shape the product at this team scale are uniquely compelling. I need $250K base, $390K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $50K signing bonus. At $250K, I commit to Linear. My floor is $230K — below that, Figma's larger equity and design-tool challenge win."
