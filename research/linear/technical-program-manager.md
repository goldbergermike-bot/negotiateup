### Technical Program Manager | Linear Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Program-Premium Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Project Management Reimagined | 2026 Focus: AI Feature Launch Orchestration

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$220K | $120K–$250K | 10–15% | $248K–$360K |
| New York | $165K–$220K | $120K–$250K | 10–15% | $248K–$360K |
| London | £125K–£168K | £91K–£190K | 10–15% | £189K–£274K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Linear orchestrate cross-functional initiatives in a company that practices what it preaches about project management. This creates a unique dynamic: Linear's TPMs must demonstrate that excellent program management is possible without the heavy process that Linear's product explicitly aims to eliminate. You'll coordinate AI feature launches, enterprise capability rollouts, and platform migrations while maintaining the lean, high-velocity execution that defines Linear's culture. In Linear's small team, the TPM function is about coordination and communication excellence, not process enforcement.

Linear TPM compensation reaches $220K base with equity grants of $120K–$250K. The negotiation leverage for TPMs comes from the unusual challenge of program managing at a company that builds project management software — your execution quality is visible not just internally but as a proof point for the product itself.

**Level Mapping:** Linear TPM = Google L5 TPM = Meta IC5 TPM = Notion TPM = Asana Program Manager

### AI Feature Launch Orchestration Lever
Linear's 2026 program management challenge is coordinating the rapid launch of AI-powered features — from AI-assisted issue creation and intelligent project predictions to automated workflow optimization. AI feature launches at Linear carry extra weight: they must demonstrate that AI can make project management better (validating Linear's product thesis) while meeting the craft quality bar. TPMs who understand AI development cycles and can coordinate launches in a minimal-process culture are critical.

Negotiate the AI launch premium: managing AI feature development in a company that actively minimizes process requires exceptional coordination skills and AI product development understanding.

**Global Levers**
1. **Lean Program Management:** "I manage complex programs with minimal process overhead — exactly Linear's cultural approach. I'm targeting $215K base and $240K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Product Launch Expertise:** "I've orchestrated AI product launches — coordinating ML development cycles, quality reviews, and go-to-market in fast-shipping cultures. I want $220K base."
3. **Project Management Meta-Expertise:** "I've managed programs at project management companies — understanding the meta-challenge of practicing what you preach. I'm looking for $215K base and $245K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "Notion TPM is offering $210K / $235K equity. Google TPM L5 is at $215K / $255K RSU. Linear's culture and AI feature roadmap are more compelling, but I need $215K base and $240K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage programs the way Linear believes project management should work — lean, high-velocity, and high-quality. I'm holding a Notion TPM offer at $210K / $235K equity and a Google L5 TPM at $215K / $255K RSU. Linear's craft culture and the AI launch orchestration challenge are what pull me here. I need $220K base, $245K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $220K, I'm committed. My floor is $200K — below that, Google's TPM structure and liquid equity win."
