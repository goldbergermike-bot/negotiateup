## Level Mapping

| Adobe Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| ICT3 | DevOps Engineer | 2-5 years |
| ICT4 | Senior DevOps Engineer | 5-8 years |
| ICT5 | Staff/Principal DevOps Engineer | 8-12 years |

DevOps Engineers at Adobe use the ICT track. Adobe's infrastructure spans three massive cloud platforms, each with distinct CI/CD, deployment, and monitoring requirements. DevOps roles at Adobe are titled variously as DevOps Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), and Platform Engineer — all map to the same comp bands. Confirm your ICT level and functional title, as SRE-designated roles sometimes carry a slight premium at the same level.

## Year 2 Refresh Strategy

Adobe's refresh culture is your biggest negotiation lever. Rather than fighting over $20K on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh. Use this script:

> *"I understand Adobe's initial grants are standard-band. What I'd like is a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of my initial grant, contingent on meeting expectations. This gives me confidence that my comp trajectory will be competitive."*

**Why this works for DevOps Engineers at Adobe:**

Adobe's initial RSU grant is $145K-$245K over 4 years. Rather than fighting for $20K more on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of your initial grant. Adobe's refresh culture is strong — a guaranteed Year 2 refresh of $116K-$245K is worth more than $20K extra on the initial grant because it sets the trajectory for Years 3 and 4.

**Example calculation:**
- Initial grant: $195K/4yr = $48.75K/year vesting
- Year 2 refresh at 85%: $165.75K/4yr = additional $41.4K/year vesting starting Year 2
- By Year 3, you're vesting $90.2K/year instead of $48.75K/year — that's the compound power of refresh negotiation
- Over a 4-year stay, the refresh commitment adds $124K+ in cumulative equity value

DevOps Engineers are critical to Adobe's platform reliability — downtime on Creative Cloud or Experience Cloud directly impacts ARR. This operational criticality gives you leverage when requesting a refresh commitment. Adobe managers have refresh budget discretion — getting this commitment in writing ensures your Years 2-4 comp grows, not stagnates.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**1. Base Salary Lever**
The DevOps band ($162K-$200K in San Jose) has $38K of range. Adobe benchmarks DevOps/SRE comp against Google SRE, Amazon DevOps, and Salesforce infrastructure roles. Your strongest base salary argument is experience with Adobe's specific technology stack: Kubernetes, AWS/Azure multi-cloud, Terraform, Jenkins/GitHub Actions, and Splunk/Datadog monitoring. If you have experience operating at Adobe's scale (millions of concurrent users across Creative Cloud), emphasize this directly.

**2. RSU Grant Lever**
The $145K-$245K RSU range offers substantial negotiation room. DevOps equity grants at Adobe correlate with the criticality of the platform you'll support. Experience Cloud infrastructure (real-time personalization at scale) and Creative Cloud services (high-availability media processing) command higher grants. If you're joining a team supporting Firefly AI infrastructure (GPU orchestration, model serving), use the AI infrastructure premium to push for upper-band RSU.

**3. Signing Bonus Lever**
DevOps signing bonuses at Adobe range from $18K-$35K. DevOps talent is in chronic short supply, and Adobe competes against cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) who offer significant signing packages. If you have competing offers from cloud providers, present them — Adobe's recruiting team understands the competitive landscape and has budget to match. Quantify any unvested equity, on-call compensation, or retained bonus you're forfeiting.

**4. Location & Transfer Lever**
DevOps roles at Adobe are available across all three hubs, with significant infrastructure teams in each. San Jose houses the core platform reliability teams. London supports EMEA infrastructure and data residency requirements (GDPR compliance infrastructure). Bangalore has a large DevOps presence supporting global platform operations and follow-the-sun incident response. DevOps engineers who can work across hubs and manage cross-timezone operations are particularly valued and can negotiate for premium placement.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** DevOps Engineers at Adobe are the backbone of a $21B+ ARR business — every minute of uptime you ensure protects revenue. Frame your negotiation around operational impact: base salary push to $185K+ (cite SRE comp at Google/Amazon), RSU above $190K (anchor to platform criticality), and a written Year 2 refresh commitment. DevOps refresh grants at Adobe are strong because the cost of replacing a DevOps engineer who understands the platform is enormous — Adobe's refresh budget reflects this retention imperative. A comprehensive negotiation strategy can add $60K-$120K to your cumulative 4-year compensation.
