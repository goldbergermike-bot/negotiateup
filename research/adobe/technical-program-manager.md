## Level Mapping

| Adobe Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| ICT3/P1 | Technical Program Manager | 3-6 years |
| ICT4/P2 | Senior Technical Program Manager | 6-10 years |
| ICT5/P3 | Principal/Staff TPM | 10-15 years |

TPMs at Adobe can be leveled on either the ICT or P track depending on the organization. The role bridges engineering execution and business outcomes. Adobe TPMs manage cross-functional programs spanning Creative Cloud releases, Experience Cloud platform migrations, Document Cloud integrations, and Firefly AI feature launches. Confirm your specific level designation, as ICT4 and P2 may have slightly different comp bands despite being equivalent in seniority.

## Year 2 Refresh Strategy

Adobe's refresh culture is your biggest negotiation lever. Rather than fighting over $20K on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh. Use this script:

> *"I understand Adobe's initial grants are standard-band. What I'd like is a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of my initial grant, contingent on meeting expectations. This gives me confidence that my comp trajectory will be competitive."*

**Why this works for Technical Program Managers at Adobe:**

Adobe's initial RSU grant is $135K-$228K over 4 years. Rather than fighting for $20K more on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of your initial grant. Adobe's refresh culture is strong — a guaranteed Year 2 refresh of $108K-$228K is worth more than $20K extra on the initial grant because it sets the trajectory for Years 3 and 4.

**Example calculation:**
- Initial grant: $180K/4yr = $45K/year vesting
- Year 2 refresh at 85%: $153K/4yr = additional $38.25K/year vesting starting Year 2
- By Year 3, you're vesting $83.25K/year instead of $45K/year — that's the compound power of refresh negotiation
- Over a 4-year stay, the refresh commitment adds $115K+ in cumulative equity value

TPMs at Adobe drive critical cross-functional programs, and their institutional knowledge is hard to replace. Losing a TPM mid-program can delay launches by quarters. This makes TPM retention a priority for Adobe leadership, and your refresh negotiation leverages this reality. Adobe managers have refresh budget discretion — getting this commitment in writing ensures your Years 2-4 comp grows, not stagnates.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**1. Base Salary Lever**
The TPM band ($158K-$195K in San Jose) has $37K of range. Adobe benchmarks TPM comp against Google TPM, Amazon TPM, and Microsoft Program Manager roles. Your base salary argument should emphasize the scope and complexity of programs you've managed — cross-team dependencies, multi-quarter timelines, and customer-facing launch coordination. TPMs who've managed programs at Adobe's scale (simultaneous global product launches, platform migrations with zero downtime) command upper-band placement.

**2. RSU Grant Lever**
The $135K-$228K RSU range is negotiable. TPM equity grants at Adobe vary by the program portfolio you'll own. TPMs supporting flagship programs (Creative Cloud annual releases, Experience Cloud platform updates, Firefly AI integration milestones) receive higher grants than those managing internal tools or infrastructure programs. If your role involves cross-cloud coordination (e.g., integrating Firefly AI across Creative Cloud products), emphasize the strategic scope to justify upper-band RSU.

**3. Signing Bonus Lever**
TPM signing bonuses at Adobe range from $18K-$35K. TPMs transitioning from other tech companies often have unvested RSU and retention bonuses at stake. Present a detailed forfeiture analysis. TPMs from consulting backgrounds (McKinsey, BCG digital practice, Accenture Technology) may have deferred bonuses or partner-track comp to account for. Adobe's recruiting team can accommodate these transitions with appropriate signing packages.

**4. Location & Transfer Lever**
TPM roles at Adobe are distributed across all three hubs. San Jose TPMs manage the largest, most complex programs. London TPMs coordinate EMEA-specific launches and regulatory compliance programs (GDPR, Digital Markets Act). Bangalore TPMs manage cross-hub engineering execution and increasingly own full program ownership for Creative Cloud feature launches. TPMs who can operate effectively across time zones and cultural contexts are rare and command premium comp.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** TPMs at Adobe are the connective tissue that makes billion-dollar product launches happen on time. Your negotiation should reflect this organizational leverage. Push base to $180K+, negotiate RSU above $180K by connecting your skills to Adobe's highest-priority programs (Firefly AI rollout, Experience Cloud platform evolution, Creative Cloud annual releases), and secure a written Year 2 refresh commitment. The TPM refresh at Adobe is competitive because program continuity directly impacts business outcomes — Adobe's leadership team understands that replacing a TPM costs more than retaining one. A comprehensive negotiation approach can add $55K-$110K to your cumulative 4-year compensation.
