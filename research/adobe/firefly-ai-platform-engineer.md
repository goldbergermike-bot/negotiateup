### Firefly AI Platform Engineer | Adobe Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced (Base + Equity + 10-15% Bonus) | Generous Refresh Culture | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15–30% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Jose | $182K–$228K | $210K–$352K | 10–15% | $248K–$332K |
| London | £120K–£152K | £126K–£218K | 10–15% | £160K–£215K |
| Bangalore | ₹48L–₹72L | ₹52L–₹105L | 10–15% | ₹65L–₹102L |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Adobe's signature role for 2026 — the Firefly AI Platform Engineer. You build the generative AI platform that powers Firefly across Adobe's entire product portfolio: image generation in Photoshop, video generation in Premiere Pro, vector generation in Illustrator, 3D generation in Substance 3D, document intelligence in Acrobat, and content personalization in Experience Cloud. Firefly is not just a model — it's a platform with APIs, SDKs, enterprise deployment, and the unique commercial safety guarantee (trained on Adobe Stock licensed content). This role exists because Firefly has become Adobe's most important product initiative since the Creative Cloud subscription transition. [Source: Adobe Firefly Platform Team 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Adobe Firefly Platform Eng (ICT5-6) = Google L4-L5 ML Infrastructure = Meta GenAI Platform Eng = Stability AI Senior Eng

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Firefly AI Platform Engineer works across the full generative AI stack:
- **Foundation Models:** The multi-modal generative models (image, video, audio, 3D, text) trained on Adobe Stock's licensed content library
- **Model Serving Infrastructure:** The inference serving layer that delivers Firefly across all Adobe products with sub-second latency at massive scale
- **Content Safety & IP Protection:** The systems that ensure Firefly outputs don't infringe on copyrighted content and comply with enterprise content governance
- **API Platform:** The Firefly API/SDK that enables enterprise customers and third-party developers to integrate generative AI into their own workflows
- **Creative Workflow Integration:** The product engineering that embeds Firefly natively into Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and other Creative Cloud tools
- **Commercially Safe Training Pipeline:** The data pipeline that trains models exclusively on licensed, rights-cleared content — Adobe's structural competitive advantage

**Year 2 Refresh Strategy — Maximum Push for Signature Role**

For the Firefly signature role, push for the maximum Year 2 refresh:

> *"Firefly is Adobe's most important product initiative. As a Firefly Platform Engineer, I'd like a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 100% of my initial grant. Firefly engineers are Adobe's highest-retention-priority talent — the refresh should reflect that. This ensures my 4-year comp trajectory stays competitive with Google and Meta GenAI offers."*

A $330K initial grant + $330K Year 2 refresh = $660K total equity over the overlap period. This is the Year 2 Refresh Strategy at its most powerful.

**Global Levers**

1. **Commercially Safe GenAI — Adobe's Structural Moat:** "Firefly is the only generative AI platform trained exclusively on licensed content. Enterprises can use Firefly without IP risk. This commercial safety moat is Adobe's biggest competitive advantage — and I build the technology that maintains it."
2. **Platform-Wide Integration:** "My platform work enables Firefly across ALL Adobe products — Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Acrobat, Experience Cloud. One platform integration, 6+ product surfaces — compounding impact."
3. **Agentic AI Premium (15-30%):** "I build autonomous creative agents — AI systems that generate complete creative assets, edit video sequences, compose layouts, and personalize content at enterprise scale without human intervention. This is agentic AI applied to the creative economy."
4. **API Revenue Platform:** "The Firefly API enables enterprise developers to integrate generative AI into their own workflows — creating a new revenue stream beyond Creative Cloud subscriptions. My platform work creates entirely new Adobe revenue."
5. **Maximum Year 2 Refresh:** Push for 100% Year 2 refresh: "Firefly engineers are Adobe's highest-priority retention target. The Year 2 refresh at 100% reflects that priority."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base, $340K RSUs over 4 years with a written Year 2 refresh at 100% of initial grant, 15% bonus, and the 15-30% Agentic AI Premium for this Firefly Platform Engineer role. I build the commercially-safe generative AI platform that is Adobe's most important product initiative — powering Firefly across the entire product portfolio and creating new API revenue. I have a Google GenAI offer at $400K and a Meta GenAI offer at $420K. Adobe's commercial safety moat is the strongest positioning in generative AI, but the refresh commitment must ensure my 4-year trajectory is competitive." Accept at $212K+ base, $305K+ RSUs, and insist on the written Year 2 refresh. This is the role where Adobe will stretch furthest — Firefly is existential.
