## Level Mapping

| Adobe Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| ICT5 | Staff Software Engineer (Entry) | 8-12 years |
| ICT6 | Staff Software Engineer (Senior) | 12-16 years |

Staff Engineers at Adobe map to ICT5-ICT6. The ICT6 level is rare and reserved for engineers with outsized organizational impact — think architects who define platform strategy across Creative Cloud or Experience Cloud. The ICT5-to-ICT6 jump represents a ~30-40% comp increase. Ensure your offer explicitly states ICT5 or ICT6, as this determines your bonus target (12% vs 18%) and RSU refresh eligibility tier.

## Year 2 Refresh Strategy

Adobe's refresh culture is your biggest negotiation lever. Rather than fighting over $20K on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh. Use this script:

> *"I understand Adobe's initial grants are standard-band. What I'd like is a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of my initial grant, contingent on meeting expectations. This gives me confidence that my comp trajectory will be competitive."*

**Why this works for Staff Software Engineers at Adobe:**

Adobe's initial RSU grant is $300K-$480K over 4 years. Rather than fighting for $20K more on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of your initial grant. Adobe's refresh culture is strong — a guaranteed Year 2 refresh of $240K-$480K is worth more than $20K extra on the initial grant because it sets the trajectory for Years 3 and 4.

**Example calculation:**
- Initial grant: $400K/4yr = $100K/year vesting
- Year 2 refresh at 90%: $360K/4yr = additional $90K/year vesting starting Year 2
- By Year 3, you're vesting $190K/year instead of $100K/year — that's the compound power of refresh negotiation
- Over a 4-year stay, the refresh commitment adds $270K+ in cumulative equity value

At the Staff level, Adobe's refresh grants are a critical retention mechanism. Directors and VPs have significant discretion over Staff refresh allocations. Getting a Year 2 commitment in writing before you start ensures you don't have to re-prove your value before receiving competitive equity. Adobe managers have refresh budget discretion — getting this commitment in writing ensures your Years 2-4 comp grows, not stagnates.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**1. Base Salary Lever**
The Staff SWE band ($218K-$265K in San Jose) has $47K of range. At this level, Adobe benchmarks against Principal Engineers at Google (L6), Senior Staff at Meta (E6), and Staff at Apple. Base salary is often the easiest lever to move — present competing offers or current comp that demonstrates upper-band positioning. Adobe's comp committee reviews Staff+ offers individually, so you're negotiating with decision-makers who have real authority.

**2. RSU Grant Lever**
The $300K-$480K RSU range represents the largest dollar-value negotiation opportunity. At Staff level, equity is the primary wealth-building vehicle. Adobe's equity grants at ICT5+ are individually approved by the VP of Engineering for the relevant business unit. Push hard here — a $400K grant vs. a $300K grant means $25K more per year in vesting. Emphasize architectural impact, cross-team influence, and experience with Adobe's core platforms (Creative Cloud Services, Experience Platform, Document Cloud infrastructure).

**3. Signing Bonus Lever**
Staff-level signing bonuses at Adobe range from $50K-$100K. This is particularly relevant if you're forfeiting significant unvested equity. Adobe will frequently match dollar-for-dollar on provable unvested RSU forfeiture up to the signing bonus band cap. Prepare a comprehensive equity forfeiture document including grant dates, vesting schedules, current stock price, and total forfeited value.

**4. Location & Transfer Lever**
Staff Engineers at Adobe have the highest internal mobility. San Jose remains the primary hub for Staff+ roles, but Adobe's London office has Staff-level leadership in Experience Cloud, and Bangalore has Staff architects leading Creative Cloud platform work. The compensation differential between hubs is significant at this level — a Staff role in Bangalore at ₹95L-₹1.23Cr represents elite compensation in the Indian market while maintaining Adobe career trajectory.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Staff-level negotiation at Adobe is a high-stakes, high-reward exercise. Your cumulative 4-year comp difference between a median offer and an optimized offer can exceed $300K. Lead with base salary (push to $245K+), then negotiate RSU to $380K+ with a detailed case for your architectural impact. The decisive move: secure a written Year 2 refresh target of 90-100% of your initial grant. At Staff level, Adobe's refresh grants are the single largest variable in long-term comp — a strong refresh trajectory can push your Year 3-4 total comp above $500K annually. Adobe's comp philosophy at Staff+ is retention-focused; they expect and respect sophisticated negotiation.
