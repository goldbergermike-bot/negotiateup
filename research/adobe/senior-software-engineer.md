## Level Mapping

| Adobe Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| ICT4 | Senior Software Engineer | 4-7 years |
| ICT5 | Senior Software Engineer (Advanced) | 7-10 years |

Senior Software Engineers at Adobe primarily map to ICT4, with top-of-band performers at ICT5. The ICT4-to-ICT5 transition is significant — ICT5 unlocks a materially higher comp band and signals path to Staff. Clarify your level in the offer and, if borderline, push for ICT5 designation.

## Year 2 Refresh Strategy

Adobe's refresh culture is your biggest negotiation lever. Rather than fighting over $20K on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh. Use this script:

> *"I understand Adobe's initial grants are standard-band. What I'd like is a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of my initial grant, contingent on meeting expectations. This gives me confidence that my comp trajectory will be competitive."*

**Why this works for Senior Software Engineers at Adobe:**

Adobe's initial RSU grant is $175K-$295K over 4 years. Rather than fighting for $20K more on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of your initial grant. Adobe's refresh culture is strong — a guaranteed Year 2 refresh of $140K-$295K is worth more than $20K extra on the initial grant because it sets the trajectory for Years 3 and 4.

**Example calculation:**
- Initial grant: $240K/4yr = $60K/year vesting
- Year 2 refresh at 85%: $204K/4yr = additional $51K/year vesting starting Year 2
- By Year 3, you're vesting $111K/year instead of $60K/year — that's the compound power of refresh negotiation
- Over a 4-year stay, the refresh commitment adds $150K+ in cumulative equity value

Adobe managers have refresh budget discretion — getting this commitment in writing ensures your Years 2-4 comp grows, not stagnates. At the Senior level, refresh grants are a primary retention tool and managers are incentivized to retain strong performers.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**1. Base Salary Lever**
The Senior SWE band at Adobe ($178K-$218K in San Jose) offers $40K of negotiable range. Adobe's comp team benchmarks against Google, Meta, and Salesforce for this level. If you have competing offers from these companies, present them directly — Adobe's recruiting team is authorized to match within band. Emphasize experience with Adobe's tech stack (Java, C++, React, microservices) and domain expertise in Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, or Experience Cloud to justify upper-band placement.

**2. RSU Grant Lever**
The $175K-$295K RSU range is substantial and highly negotiable. Adobe's 4-year vesting schedule (25% annual, 1-year cliff) means Year 1 equity is meaningful. For Senior Engineers, the initial grant size often correlates with your level designation — ICT5 grants skew higher. If the recruiter won't move on initial RSU, this is your cue to deploy the Year 2 Refresh Strategy. Adobe's equity-to-base ratio at this level should target 1.0x-1.4x.

**3. Signing Bonus Lever**
Adobe offers signing bonuses of $25K-$60K for Senior Software Engineers. This is a one-time lever, so use it to cover any unvested equity you're leaving behind. Prepare a detailed forfeiture spreadsheet showing RSU vesting dates, unvested amounts, and bonus clawback exposure. Adobe's talent acquisition team can escalate sign-on requests to the compensation committee for amounts above $40K.

**4. Location & Transfer Lever**
Adobe's Senior Engineers have strong internal mobility options across San Jose, London, and Bangalore. The London hub is growing its Experience Cloud engineering team, and Bangalore has significant Creative Cloud engineering presence. If you're interviewing for San Jose but open to London, you can negotiate for the San Jose offer while retaining a 12-month transfer option. Additionally, remote work flexibility varies by team — some Adobe engineering teams operate fully remote within the US, which effectively gives you San Jose comp at lower cost-of-living locations.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** At the Senior level, Adobe expects negotiation and has built meaningful flexibility into the system. Your optimal strategy is a three-stage approach: First, push base salary to the $200K-$218K range using competing offers. Second, negotiate the initial RSU grant above the midpoint ($235K+). Third — and this is the move that separates sophisticated negotiators — secure a written Year 2 refresh commitment of 85-100% of your initial grant. This three-layer approach can add $80K-$150K to your cumulative 4-year compensation. Adobe's Senior Engineers who negotiate well consistently out-earn peers who accept initial offers by 15-25%.
