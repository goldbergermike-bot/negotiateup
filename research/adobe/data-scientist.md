## Level Mapping

| Adobe Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| ICT3 | Data Scientist | 2-4 years |
| ICT4 | Senior Data Scientist | 4-7 years |
| ICT5 | Staff/Principal Data Scientist | 7-12 years |

Data Scientists at Adobe use the ICT track. Adobe's DS roles span experimentation and analytics (Creative Cloud engagement metrics), recommendation systems (Experience Cloud personalization), and generative model evaluation (Firefly AI quality metrics). Your level placement depends on both YOE and the technical sophistication of your prior work. Push for ICT4 if you have 4+ years and strong ML/statistical modeling experience.

## Year 2 Refresh Strategy

Adobe's refresh culture is your biggest negotiation lever. Rather than fighting over $20K on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh. Use this script:

> *"I understand Adobe's initial grants are standard-band. What I'd like is a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of my initial grant, contingent on meeting expectations. This gives me confidence that my comp trajectory will be competitive."*

**Why this works for Data Scientists at Adobe:**

Adobe's initial RSU grant is $155K-$262K over 4 years. Rather than fighting for $20K more on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of your initial grant. Adobe's refresh culture is strong — a guaranteed Year 2 refresh of $124K-$262K is worth more than $20K extra on the initial grant because it sets the trajectory for Years 3 and 4.

**Example calculation:**
- Initial grant: $210K/4yr = $52.5K/year vesting
- Year 2 refresh at 85%: $178.5K/4yr = additional $44.6K/year vesting starting Year 2
- By Year 3, you're vesting $97.1K/year instead of $52.5K/year — that's the compound power of refresh negotiation
- Over a 4-year stay, the refresh commitment adds $134K+ in cumulative equity value

Data Scientists at Adobe are in high demand — Adobe's three clouds generate massive datasets, and DS talent directly impacts product quality, user engagement, and revenue optimization. Adobe managers have refresh budget discretion — getting this commitment in writing ensures your Years 2-4 comp grows, not stagnates.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**1. Base Salary Lever**
The DS band ($165K-$205K in San Jose) has $40K of range. Adobe benchmarks DS comp against Google, Meta, and Netflix. Your base salary argument should emphasize the specific analytical domain you'll serve — Experience Cloud DS roles (marketing analytics, customer journey optimization) can point to revenue impact, while Creative Cloud DS roles (engagement metrics, feature adoption) can point to user retention impact. Bring evidence of quantified business impact from prior roles.

**2. RSU Grant Lever**
The $155K-$262K RSU range is significant. Adobe's DS equity grants vary by team and strategic importance. Data Scientists supporting Firefly AI (model evaluation, quality metrics, responsible AI), Experience Cloud (personalization algorithms, marketing mix models), or Adobe Sensei receive premium equity. If your offer letter specifies one of these teams, use the strategic importance to push for upper-band RSU. If it doesn't, ask your hiring manager which product area you'll support and use that information in negotiation.

**3. Signing Bonus Lever**
DS signing bonuses at Adobe range from $20K-$40K. Data Scientists often come from academia or specialized DS roles at other companies, so the forfeiture calculation may include lost research stipends, academic bonuses, or unvested equity. Present a comprehensive transition cost analysis. Adobe's recruiting team is experienced in DS hiring and understands the academic-to-industry transition value gap.

**4. Location & Transfer Lever**
Adobe's Data Science teams are distributed across all three hubs. San Jose has the largest DS presence, spanning all three clouds. London DS roles focus on EMEA customer analytics and Experience Cloud personalization. Bangalore has a significant DS team supporting Adobe Analytics, Target, and Creative Cloud experimentation. The Bangalore DS market is particularly competitive, with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon all hiring aggressively — use competing offers from these companies as leverage.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Data Scientists at Adobe sit at the intersection of product, engineering, and business strategy — your negotiation should reflect this cross-functional value. Push base to $185K+, negotiate RSU above $200K by linking your skills to Adobe's highest-priority product areas (Firefly AI, Experience Cloud personalization, Adobe Sensei), and secure a written Year 2 refresh commitment. The Year 2 refresh is particularly strategic for DS roles because Adobe's DS teams have high refresh budgets driven by competitive retention pressure from FAANG companies. A well-negotiated package with a strong refresh trajectory can add $70K-$130K to your cumulative 4-year compensation.
