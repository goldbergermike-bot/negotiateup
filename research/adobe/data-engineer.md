## Level Mapping

| Adobe Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| ICT3 | Data Engineer | 2-5 years |
| ICT4 | Senior Data Engineer | 5-8 years |
| ICT5 | Staff/Principal Data Engineer | 8-12 years |

Data Engineers at Adobe use the ICT track. Adobe's data infrastructure is massive — Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) processes billions of events daily, Creative Cloud generates petabytes of usage data, and Firefly AI requires large-scale training data pipelines. Data Engineers build and maintain the pipelines, warehouses, and real-time streaming systems that power all three clouds. Level placement depends on pipeline scale experience, data modeling sophistication, and real-time processing expertise.

## Year 2 Refresh Strategy

Adobe's refresh culture is your biggest negotiation lever. Rather than fighting over $20K on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh. Use this script:

> *"I understand Adobe's initial grants are standard-band. What I'd like is a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of my initial grant, contingent on meeting expectations. This gives me confidence that my comp trajectory will be competitive."*

**Why this works for Data Engineers at Adobe:**

Adobe's initial RSU grant is $142K-$242K over 4 years. Rather than fighting for $20K more on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of your initial grant. Adobe's refresh culture is strong — a guaranteed Year 2 refresh of $114K-$242K is worth more than $20K extra on the initial grant because it sets the trajectory for Years 3 and 4.

**Example calculation:**
- Initial grant: $192K/4yr = $48K/year vesting
- Year 2 refresh at 85%: $163.2K/4yr = additional $40.8K/year vesting starting Year 2
- By Year 3, you're vesting $88.8K/year instead of $48K/year — that's the compound power of refresh negotiation
- Over a 4-year stay, the refresh commitment adds $122K+ in cumulative equity value

Data Engineers at Adobe are foundational to every business unit. Without reliable data pipelines, Adobe Analytics can't process customer events, Experience Cloud can't personalize content, and Firefly AI can't train models. This foundational importance translates to strong retention incentives. Adobe managers have refresh budget discretion — getting this commitment in writing ensures your Years 2-4 comp grows, not stagnates.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**1. Base Salary Lever**
The Data Engineer band ($158K-$198K in San Jose) has $40K of range. Adobe benchmarks DE comp against Google, Snowflake, Databricks, and Amazon data infrastructure roles. Your base salary argument should emphasize experience with Adobe's core data stack: Apache Spark, Kafka, Flink (for real-time streaming), and cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift). If you have experience building data pipelines at Adobe's scale (billions of events/day), make this the centerpiece of your base salary case.

**2. RSU Grant Lever**
The $142K-$242K RSU range is meaningful. Data Engineer equity grants at Adobe vary by the data platform you'll support. Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) data engineers receive upper-band grants because AEP is Adobe's fastest-growing enterprise product. Data Engineers supporting Firefly AI training pipelines (curating creative datasets, managing model training data) also command premium equity due to the AI priority. If you know your specific team, use the platform's strategic importance to push for upper-band RSU.

**3. Signing Bonus Lever**
Data Engineer signing bonuses at Adobe range from $18K-$35K. If you're coming from a data infrastructure company (Snowflake, Databricks, Confluent), you likely have significant unvested equity — present a detailed forfeiture schedule. If transitioning from cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP data services teams), quantify any cloud credits, certifications, or training investments you're forfeiting. Adobe's recruiting team understands the competitive landscape for data engineering talent.

**4. Location & Transfer Lever**
Data Engineering roles at Adobe are well-distributed across all three hubs. San Jose houses the core AEP data platform team and Firefly AI data pipeline engineers. London supports EMEA data infrastructure with particular emphasis on data residency and GDPR-compliant data architectures. Bangalore has a large Data Engineering presence supporting Adobe Analytics, global data warehouse operations, and Creative Cloud telemetry pipelines. The Bangalore DE market is highly competitive, with Flipkart, Google, and Amazon all hiring aggressively — competing offers from these companies are effective leverage.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Data Engineers at Adobe are building the data backbone of a $21B+ ARR business. Frame your negotiation around the scale and strategic importance of the data you'll manage. Push base to $180K+ (cite Snowflake/Databricks comp as benchmarks), negotiate RSU above $190K by connecting to AEP or Firefly AI data pipeline roles, and secure a written Year 2 refresh commitment. Data Engineer refresh grants at Adobe are strong because the ramp time for a new DE to understand Adobe's data ecosystem is 6-12 months — the cost of turnover is high, and refresh grants reflect this. A comprehensive negotiation strategy can add $60K-$120K to your cumulative 4-year compensation.
