### ML/AI Engineer | Adobe Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced (Base + Equity + 10-15% Bonus) | Generous Refresh Culture | **+15–30% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM** | Firefly AI Core Team

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Jose | $178K–$222K | $200K–$338K | 10–15% | $242K–$322K |
| London | £118K–£148K | £120K–£210K | 10–15% | £155K–£208K |
| Bangalore | ₹45L–₹68L | ₹50L–₹100L | 10–15% | ₹62L–₹98L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Adobe ML/AI Engineers are building the intelligence layer for the world's creative tools — Firefly (generative AI for images, video, audio, 3D), Sensei (ML features across Experience Cloud), and the AI assistants embedded across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. Adobe's AI is uniquely differentiated: trained on licensed content (Adobe Stock) rather than scraped data, making it commercially safe for enterprise use. The Agentic AI Premium (15-30%) applies because you're building autonomous creative agents — AI systems that generate, edit, and compose creative content with minimal human intervention. Adobe's refresh culture makes the Year 2 Refresh Strategy critical. [Source: Adobe ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Year 2 Refresh Strategy**

Adobe's refresh culture is your biggest negotiation lever. Rather than fighting over $20K on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh. Use this script:

> *"I understand Adobe's initial grants are standard-band. What I'd like is a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 90-100% of my initial grant for ML/AI roles, contingent on meeting expectations. ML talent is the scarcest — the refresh should reflect that."*

For ML/AI at Adobe, push for 90-100% refresh (vs. 80% for standard roles) because ML talent scarcity gives you maximum leverage. A $300K initial grant + $270K Year 2 refresh = $570K total equity over the overlap period — dramatically better than $320K initial alone.

**Global Levers**

1. **Firefly — Commercially Safe Generative AI:** "Firefly is trained on licensed content (Adobe Stock), making it the only commercially safe generative AI for enterprise creative work. I'm building AI models that enterprises can legally use — that commercial safety moat is Adobe's biggest differentiator."
2. **Agentic AI Premium (15-30%):** "I build autonomous creative agents — AI systems that generate images, edit video, compose designs, and create content with minimal human direction. This is agentic AI applied to the $50B+ creative tools market."
3. **ML Scarcity + Year 2 Refresh:** "ML engineers who understand both generative AI AND creative workflows are the rarest talent. I'm pushing for a 100% Year 2 refresh — the refresh should reflect ML scarcity."
4. **$21B+ ARR AI Revenue Impact:** "Firefly AI features drive Creative Cloud retention and upsell. Every ML feature I ship directly impacts $21B+ in ARR through higher customer engagement and lower churn."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an ML/AI role building Firefly generative AI — the only commercially safe creative AI in the market — I'm targeting $215K base, $320K RSUs over 4 years with a written Year 2 refresh at 100% of initial grant, 15% bonus, and the 15-30% Agentic AI Premium. I have a Google ML offer at $370K and a Databricks pre-IPO offer at $420K. Adobe's commercially-safe AI positioning is unique, but the refresh commitment must close the gap." Accept at $205K+ base, $290K+ RSUs, and push hard for the written Year 2 refresh at 90%+.
