| **London** | £103,000 - £129,000 | £89,000 - £149,000 | 10-15% | £131,000 - £174,000 |
| **Bangalore** | ₹47,00,000 - ₹59,00,000 | ₹37,00,000 - ₹74,00,000 | 10-15% | ₹60,00,000 - ₹80,00,000 |

## Level Mapping

| Adobe Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| P1 | Product Manager | 3-5 years |
| P2 | Senior Product Manager | 5-8 years |
| P3 | Group Product Manager | 8-12 years |

Adobe uses the P (Product) leveling track. PMs at P1-P2 own feature-level or product-area roadmaps within one of Adobe's three clouds. The P2-to-P3 transition is a significant step, requiring cross-product portfolio ownership and demonstrated revenue impact. Clarify your P-level in the offer — P1 and P2 have different bonus targets and equity bands.

## Year 2 Refresh Strategy

Adobe's refresh culture is your biggest negotiation lever. Rather than fighting over $20K on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh. Use this script:

> *"I understand Adobe's initial grants are standard-band. What I'd like is a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of my initial grant, contingent on meeting expectations. This gives me confidence that my comp trajectory will be competitive."*

**Why this works for Product Managers at Adobe:**

Adobe's initial RSU grant is $148K-$248K over 4 years. Rather than fighting for $20K more on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of your initial grant. Adobe's refresh culture is strong — a guaranteed Year 2 refresh of $118K-$248K is worth more than $20K extra on the initial grant because it sets the trajectory for Years 3 and 4.

**Example calculation:**
- Initial grant: $200K/4yr = $50K/year vesting
- Year 2 refresh at 85%: $170K/4yr = additional $42.5K/year vesting starting Year 2
- By Year 3, you're vesting $92.5K/year instead of $50K/year — that's the compound power of refresh negotiation
- Over a 4-year stay, the refresh commitment adds $127K+ in cumulative equity value

Adobe PMs are central to product strategy and monetization. The company invests heavily in PM retention because PM turnover directly impacts roadmap continuity. This gives you real leverage when asking for a refresh commitment. Adobe managers have refresh budget discretion — getting this commitment in writing ensures your Years 2-4 comp grows, not stagnates.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**1. Base Salary Lever**
The PM band ($158K-$198K in San Jose) has $40K of range. Adobe PMs are benchmarked against Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft PM roles. Your strongest base salary argument is domain expertise in one of Adobe's three clouds — if you've shipped products in creative tools, document management, or digital experience/marketing tech, emphasize this directly. PMs with B2B SaaS or enterprise experience command upper-band base for Experience Cloud roles.

**2. RSU Grant Lever**
The $148K-$248K RSU range is meaningful. Adobe PM equity grants correlate with the strategic importance of your product area. Firefly AI, Experience Platform, and Creative Cloud flagship products (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere) command higher grants. If you're joining a growth product area (Firefly AI, Adobe Express, Experience Cloud AI features), use the strategic priority of your area to justify upper-band RSU.

**3. Signing Bonus Lever**
PM signing bonuses at Adobe range from $20K-$45K. PMs often have less unvested equity than senior engineers, so the forfeiture argument may be less applicable. Instead, frame signing bonus asks around transition costs (relocation, delayed start compensation, lost bonus at current employer). Adobe's recruiting team has discretion for PM sign-ons and can typically approve up to $35K without VP escalation.

**4. Location & Transfer Lever**
PM roles at Adobe are concentrated in San Jose but expanding across hubs. London has PM positions for international product variants and EMEA-focused Experience Cloud features. Bangalore has PM roles focused on Adobe Express and emerging market products. Adobe's PM transfer policy is flexible after 12 months, and PMs who demonstrate cross-hub collaboration skills (managing stakeholders across time zones) are valued for leadership track roles.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Adobe PM negotiation should center on the strategic value of your product domain expertise. Lead with base salary (push to $185K+), then tie your RSU ask to the specific product area you're joining — Firefly AI and Experience Cloud PMs can justify top-of-band equity. The Year 2 refresh strategy is particularly powerful for PMs because Adobe's PM refresh grants are generous (managers view PM retention as critical to roadmap execution). A well-executed three-lever strategy (base + RSU + written refresh commitment) can add $60K-$120K to your cumulative 4-year comp. Don't be afraid to name your number — Adobe's PM recruiting pipeline is competitive, and they'll work to close you.
