## Compensation Ranges by Region

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| **San Jose** | $172,000 - $212,000 | $165,000 - $278,000 | 10-15% | $218,000 - $288,000 |
| **London** | £112,000 - £138,000 | £99,000 - £167,000 | 10-15% | £142,000 - £187,000 |
| **Bangalore** | ₹52,00,000 - ₹63,00,000 | ₹41,00,000 - ₹83,00,000 | 10-15% | ₹65,00,000 - ₹86,00,000 |

*London ranges reflect ~65-70% of US base, ~60-65% of US RSU. Bangalore ranges reflect ~25-35% of US equivalent in INR.*

## Level Mapping

| Adobe Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| ICT3 | Security Engineer | 3-5 years |
| ICT4 | Senior Security Engineer | 5-8 years |
| ICT5 | Staff/Principal Security Engineer | 8-14 years |

Security Engineers at Adobe use the ICT track. Adobe's security organization covers application security (Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, Experience Cloud), cloud infrastructure security (multi-cloud posture management), data privacy and compliance (GDPR, CCPA, SOC2), and AI/ML security (Firefly AI model protection, content authenticity). The security domain has a talent scarcity premium — use this in negotiation. Push for ICT4 if you have 5+ years and relevant certifications or published security research.

## Year 2 Refresh Strategy

Adobe's refresh culture is your biggest negotiation lever. Rather than fighting over $20K on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh. Use this script:

> *"I understand Adobe's initial grants are standard-band. What I'd like is a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of my initial grant, contingent on meeting expectations. This gives me confidence that my comp trajectory will be competitive."*

**Why this works for Security Engineers at Adobe:**

Adobe's initial RSU grant is $165K-$278K over 4 years. Rather than fighting for $20K more on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of your initial grant. Adobe's refresh culture is strong — a guaranteed Year 2 refresh of $132K-$278K is worth more than $20K extra on the initial grant because it sets the trajectory for Years 3 and 4.

**Example calculation:**
- Initial grant: $220K/4yr = $55K/year vesting
- Year 2 refresh at 90%: $198K/4yr = additional $49.5K/year vesting starting Year 2
- By Year 3, you're vesting $104.5K/year instead of $55K/year — that's the compound power of refresh negotiation
- Over a 4-year stay, the refresh commitment adds $148K+ in cumulative equity value

Security Engineers are among the hardest roles to replace at Adobe. A single security incident on Creative Cloud could impact hundreds of millions of users and billions in revenue. This existential risk profile means Adobe invests aggressively in security talent retention. Adobe managers have refresh budget discretion — getting this commitment in writing ensures your Years 2-4 comp grows, not stagnates.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**1. Base Salary Lever**
The Security Engineer band ($172K-$212K in San Jose) has $40K of range and sits above most non-AI engineering roles — reflecting the security talent premium. Adobe benchmarks against Google Security, Microsoft Security, and CrowdStrike/Palo Alto for offensive security roles. Your base salary argument should emphasize specializations: application security (code review, pen testing, vulnerability management), cloud security (AWS/Azure security architecture), or AI security (model adversarial attacks, content authenticity — highly relevant for Firefly AI). Each specialization commands different premiums, with AI security currently commanding the highest.

**2. RSU Grant Lever**
The $165K-$278K RSU range is the largest among comparable-level non-AI roles at Adobe. Security equity grants correlate with the attack surface you'll protect. Security Engineers supporting Document Cloud (PDF security, digital signatures, enterprise compliance) and Experience Cloud (customer data protection, GDPR compliance) command upper-band grants. If your role involves Firefly AI security (content provenance, Content Credentials initiative, adversarial model attacks), you're in the highest-demand security niche at Adobe.

**3. Signing Bonus Lever**
Security signing bonuses at Adobe range from $22K-$45K. Security professionals often hold certifications (CISSP, OSCP, CEH) that represent significant personal investment — mention these as evidence of your market value. If you're coming from a government/defense background (NSA, GCHQ, ISRO CERT), the private sector transition typically involves a comp uplift that Adobe should match. If leaving a security consultancy, quantify lost billing revenue or partner-track earnings.

**4. Location & Transfer Lever**
Security roles at Adobe are distributed across all three hubs with distinct focus areas. San Jose houses the core product security and security architecture teams. London security teams focus on EMEA regulatory compliance, data privacy, and GDPR enforcement. Bangalore has a significant security operations and vulnerability management presence, with growing investment in security automation. Security Engineers in London often receive a premium due to the concentration of fintech and data privacy expertise competing for the same talent pool.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Security Engineers at Adobe protect a $21B+ ARR business serving hundreds of millions of users. Your negotiation should reflect the asymmetric risk profile: the cost of a security failure vastly exceeds the cost of paying you well. Push base to $195K+ (the talent scarcity premium is real), negotiate RSU above $220K by connecting your skills to Adobe's highest-risk attack surfaces, and secure a written Year 2 refresh commitment. Security refresh grants at Adobe are among the most generous because retaining institutional security knowledge is critical — a Year 2 refresh at 90% of your initial grant is achievable. A well-negotiated package can add $70K-$140K to your cumulative 4-year compensation.
