### Engineering Manager | Adobe Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Comp Model (Base + Equity + 12-18% Bonus) | Generous Refresh Culture | Creative Cloud + Document Cloud + Experience Cloud ($21B+ ARR)

## Compensation Ranges by Region

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| **San Jose** | $198,000 - $242,000 | $248,000 - $400,000 | 12-18% | $282,000 - $368,000 |
| **London** | £129,000 - £157,000 | £149,000 - £240,000 | 12-18% | £183,000 - £239,000 |
| **Bangalore** | ₹59,00,000 - ₹72,00,000 | ₹62,00,000 - ₹1,20,00,000 | 12-18% | ₹85,00,000 - ₹1,10,00,000 |

*London ranges reflect ~65-70% of US base, ~60-65% of US RSU. Bangalore ranges reflect ~25-35% of US equivalent in INR.*

## Level Mapping

| Adobe Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| M1 | Engineering Manager | 6-10 years (2+ managing) |
| M2 | Senior Engineering Manager | 10-14 years (4+ managing) |
| M3 | Director of Engineering | 14+ years (6+ managing) |

Adobe uses the M (Management) track starting at M1. Engineering Managers typically enter at M1, managing teams of 6-12 engineers. The M1-to-M2 transition requires demonstrated cross-team influence and typically comes with a 25-35% comp increase. Confirm your exact M-level in the offer, as M1 and M2 have meaningfully different comp bands and bonus targets (12% vs 15-18%).

## Year 2 Refresh Strategy

Adobe's refresh culture is your biggest negotiation lever. Rather than fighting over $20K on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh. Use this script:

> *"I understand Adobe's initial grants are standard-band. What I'd like is a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of my initial grant, contingent on meeting expectations. This gives me confidence that my comp trajectory will be competitive."*

**Why this works for Engineering Managers at Adobe:**

Adobe's initial RSU grant is $248K-$400K over 4 years. Rather than fighting for $20K more on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of your initial grant. Adobe's refresh culture is strong — a guaranteed Year 2 refresh of $198K-$400K is worth more than $20K extra on the initial grant because it sets the trajectory for Years 3 and 4.

**Example calculation:**
- Initial grant: $320K/4yr = $80K/year vesting
- Year 2 refresh at 85%: $272K/4yr = additional $68K/year vesting starting Year 2
- By Year 3, you're vesting $148K/year instead of $80K/year — that's the compound power of refresh negotiation
- Over a 4-year stay, the refresh commitment adds $204K+ in cumulative equity value

Engineering Managers at Adobe have a unique advantage: they see refresh allocation from the other side. You understand that managers have discretion over refresh budgets. Use this knowledge in your own negotiation — you know these commitments are feasible because you'll be making similar decisions for your reports. Adobe managers have refresh budget discretion — getting this commitment in writing ensures your Years 2-4 comp grows, not stagnates.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**1. Base Salary Lever**
The EM band ($198K-$242K in San Jose) offers $44K of range. Adobe's Engineering Managers are benchmarked against Google M1 (L6 equivalent), Meta M1 (E6 equivalent), and Salesforce EM roles. Base salary negotiation at the EM level is straightforward — present your current base, competing offers, and team size context. Adobe values managers who've led teams through complex product launches (Creative Cloud releases, Experience Platform migrations, Firefly AI feature rollouts).

**2. RSU Grant Lever**
The $248K-$400K RSU range is where your negotiation should focus the most energy. Adobe's EM equity grants are approved by the hiring Director or VP. Key factors that push grants higher: larger team size (8+ reports), critical business unit (Experience Cloud, Firefly AI), and demonstrated retention risk (competing offers from FAANG). Frame your equity ask in terms of the team you'll retain — "My comp needs to credibly position me as a leader worth following."

**3. Signing Bonus Lever**
EM signing bonuses at Adobe range from $40K-$80K. The most effective strategy is presenting a detailed unvested equity schedule from your current employer, plus any bonus clawback exposure. Adobe's recruiting team can escalate EM sign-on requests to the VP level for approval. If your current employer has a 1-year bonus cycle, time your move to maximize the signing bonus justification.

**4. Location & Transfer Lever**
Adobe's Engineering Manager roles are available across all three hubs. San Jose offers the largest scope (Creative Cloud platform teams, Experience Cloud infrastructure), London has growing EM opportunities in Document Cloud and international product teams, and Bangalore has significant EM headcount across all three clouds. Managers who express willingness to lead cross-hub teams (e.g., San Jose-Bangalore distributed teams) are particularly valued and can negotiate for premium comp to reflect the increased complexity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Engineering Manager negotiation at Adobe requires a different framing than IC roles. You're not just negotiating for yourself — you're demonstrating the strategic thinking you'll bring to the role. Lead with base ($220K+ target), push RSU to $320K+ by framing your impact on team retention and delivery, then deploy the Year 2 refresh strategy. The compounding effect is powerful: a well-negotiated EM package with a strong refresh commitment can yield $350K-$420K annual total comp by Year 3. Adobe's EM hiring bar is high, and their comp flexibility reflects it — they'd rather pay $50K more than lose a strong EM candidate to Google or Meta.
