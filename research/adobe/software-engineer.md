## Level Mapping

| Adobe Level | Industry Equivalent | Typical YOE |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| ICT2 | Software Engineer (Entry) | 0-2 years |
| ICT3 | Software Engineer (Mid) | 2-4 years |
| ICT4 | Senior Software Engineer | 4-7 years |

Adobe uses the ICT (Individual Contributor Technical) leveling system. Software Engineer roles typically span ICT2-ICT3. Ensure your offer letter specifies your exact level, as this determines your comp band and refresh eligibility tier.

## Year 2 Refresh Strategy

Adobe's refresh culture is your biggest negotiation lever. Rather than fighting over $20K on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh. Use this script:

> *"I understand Adobe's initial grants are standard-band. What I'd like is a written commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of my initial grant, contingent on meeting expectations. This gives me confidence that my comp trajectory will be competitive."*

**Why this works for Software Engineers at Adobe:**

Adobe's initial RSU grant is $100K-$175K over 4 years. Rather than fighting for $20K more on the initial grant, negotiate a WRITTEN commitment to a Year 2 refresh target of 80-100% of your initial grant. Adobe's refresh culture is strong — a guaranteed Year 2 refresh of $80K-$175K is worth more than $20K extra on the initial grant because it sets the trajectory for Years 3 and 4.

**Example calculation:**
- Initial grant: $140K/4yr = $35K/year vesting
- Year 2 refresh at 80%: $112K/4yr = additional $28K/year vesting starting Year 2
- By Year 3, you're vesting $63K/year instead of $35K/year — that's the compound power of refresh negotiation

Adobe managers have refresh budget discretion — getting this commitment in writing ensures your Years 2-4 comp grows, not stagnates.

## Global Negotiation Levers

**1. Base Salary Lever**
Adobe's base bands are well-defined but have meaningful spread. For Software Engineers, the $145K-$178K range in San Jose offers $33K of negotiation room. Come prepared with competing offers or market data showing your skills command upper-band positioning. Adobe's HR team responds well to data-driven arguments anchored to Levels.fyi and Glassdoor ranges.

**2. RSU Grant Lever**
The initial RSU grant ($100K-$175K/4yr) is where most candidates leave money on the table. Adobe uses a 4-year vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff. Push for the upper end by emphasizing in-demand skills (cloud-native, AI/ML familiarity, Creative Cloud ecosystem experience). If the initial grant is firm, pivot to the Year 2 Refresh Strategy above.

**3. Signing Bonus Lever**
Adobe offers signing bonuses of $15K-$35K for Software Engineers, though they don't always volunteer this. If you're leaving unvested equity at a current employer, present a detailed vesting schedule to justify a signing bonus that covers your forfeit. Adobe's recruiting team has discretion on sign-on amounts up to band limits.

**4. Location & Transfer Lever**
Adobe's three regional hubs (San Jose, London, Bangalore) have distinct cost-of-living adjustments. If you're open to location flexibility, use this as a negotiation chip. San Jose offers the highest absolute comp, but London and Bangalore roles may offer better purchasing-power-adjusted comp. Additionally, Adobe's internal transfer policy is generous after 12 months — starting in one hub with a plan to transfer can be a strategic long-term play.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Adobe's balanced comp model means no single lever dominates — but the Year 2 refresh is the hidden multiplier most candidates miss. Lead your negotiation with base salary (easiest to move), anchor your RSU ask to the upper band, then pivot to a written Year 2 refresh commitment. This three-layer approach — base + initial RSU + guaranteed refresh — can add $40K-$80K to your cumulative 4-year compensation. Adobe values candidates who negotiate professionally; their recruiting team expects it and has built flexibility into the system.
