### Software Engineer | Cohere Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Competitive Base | Enterprise RAG Dominance | Enterprise Sovereignty

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$120K-C$155K | $120K-$215K | — | C$155K-C$215K |
| San Francisco | $145K-$185K | $120K-$215K | — | $181K-$239K |
| London | £105K-£135K | $120K-$215K | — | £138K-£190K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Cohere's Software Engineers build the enterprise AI infrastructure that Fortune 500 companies deploy inside their own security perimeters. You are writing the code behind Command R+, the leading enterprise RAG model, and Embed/Rerank — the retrieval stack that enterprise customers trust with regulated data. Founded by Aidan Gomez, co-author of the original Transformer paper ("Attention Is All You Need"), Cohere is not a consumer chatbot company — it is the enterprise AI sovereignty platform, and your engineering work directly enables the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere SWE = Google L3-L4 (Toronto) = Meta E3-E4 = Anthropic Junior SWE = Amazon SDE I-II. Cohere's Toronto office competes directly with Google Toronto, Meta Toronto, and Shopify for engineering talent. Your pre-IPO equity position at Cohere's $5.5B+ valuation represents significant upside compared to publicly traded FAANG RSUs at mature valuations.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Cohere is valued at $5.5B+ and hasn't IPO'd yet. My equity grant at this stage has 3-5x upside potential based on enterprise AI market growth. I need a grant sized at $150K+ over four years to make the pre-IPO risk worthwhile — Google Toronto is offering me L4 RSUs at a guaranteed public valuation."
2. **Toronto Cost-of-Living Arbitrage:** "I'm delivering Silicon Valley-quality engineering from Toronto. The C$/US$ arbitrage means Cohere gets world-class talent at 20-30% less than SF market rates. My base should be at the top of the Toronto band — C$145K+ — to reflect that I could relocate to SF for a 25% bump."
3. **Enterprise AI Specialization Premium:** "Enterprise AI infrastructure is not generic SWE work. I'm building systems that handle regulated data in healthcare, finance, and government environments. This requires security-aware engineering, compliance knowledge, and on-prem deployment expertise that generic SWEs at consumer companies don't have."
4. **Competing Offer Framing:** "Google Toronto is offering me L4 at C$165K base with $180K RSUs over four years at a public valuation with zero risk. Cohere's offer needs to compensate me for pre-IPO illiquidity risk — I need either a higher equity grant or a base that closes the gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning — being the 'safe' AI choice for Fortune 500 is a massive market opportunity that OpenAI and Anthropic can't address. I have a Google Toronto L4 offer at C$165K base with $180K public RSUs. Cohere's mission is more compelling, but I need the comp to reflect the pre-IPO risk I'm taking. I'd like to see C$150K base and $180K equity over four years. That's still below Google's guaranteed total comp, but the pre-IPO upside makes it worthwhile. My accept-at floor is C$140K base with $150K equity — below that, the risk/reward doesn't work against a public-company offer."
