**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Cohere own the enterprise RAG product strategy — you define the Command R+ roadmap, prioritize features for the Embed/Rerank retrieval pipeline, and translate Fortune 500 customer requirements into the product decisions that determine Cohere's enterprise revenue trajectory. This role is the nexus between Cohere's Transformer-pedigree AI research (founded by Aidan Gomez, co-author of the original Transformer paper) and the enterprise deployment realities of regulated industries. You are not building a consumer chatbot — you are defining the enterprise AI product that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere PM = Google L5 PM (Toronto) = Meta PM (IC5) = Amazon Sr. PMT = Anthropic Product Manager. In the Toronto market, Cohere competes with Google PM, Shopify PM, and increasingly with Databricks and Scale AI for enterprise AI product talent. The pre-IPO equity at Cohere's $5.5B+ valuation is the key differentiator against public-company PM packages.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **Enterprise Revenue Attribution:** "As a PM owning the Command R+ / RAG product roadmap, my product decisions directly determine whether Fortune 500 customers renew $1M+ ARR contracts. When I prioritize on-prem deployment features or document connector integrations, I'm directly enabling enterprise revenue that doesn't exist without my product work. My comp should reflect direct revenue attribution, not generic PM benchmarks."
2. **Pre-IPO Product Equity:** "Product Managers at pre-IPO companies shape the product-market fit that determines valuation at IPO. I need $240K+ in equity over four years — that's sized to reflect my direct impact on Cohere's enterprise revenue trajectory and the 2-4x upside potential at IPO. Google PM in Toronto offers $200K+ in guaranteed public RSUs."
3. **Enterprise AI Product Scarcity:** "The pool of PMs who understand both LLM capabilities and enterprise buyer requirements (procurement cycles, compliance needs, on-prem deployment) is extremely small. I'm not a consumer PM learning enterprise — I bring direct enterprise AI product experience from [previous company] with a track record of shipping products that pass Fortune 500 security reviews."
4. **Customer-Facing Impact:** "Cohere PMs regularly meet with Fortune 500 CISOs, CTOs, and procurement teams. My ability to translate customer pain points into product roadmap items directly influences deal velocity. I've closed or influenced $X million in enterprise deals through product roadmap alignment with customer needs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is the most defensible moat in enterprise AI — I want to be the PM defining the product roadmap that Fortune 500 CISOs buy. I'm holding a Google PM offer in Toronto at C$170K base with $210K RSUs over four years — C$222K+ TC guaranteed. For Cohere, I'm targeting C$175K base with $260K equity over four years. The equity premium reflects both the pre-IPO risk and my direct impact on enterprise revenue — every product decision I make determines whether Fortune 500 customers sign $1M+ contracts. I also want to negotiate a performance component tied to enterprise customer NPS or renewal rates. My accept-at floor is C$160K base with $220K equity — below that, the risk-adjusted comparison to Google's guaranteed package doesn't work."
