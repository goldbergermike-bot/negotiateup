**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Cohere orchestrate the most complex cross-functional initiatives in enterprise AI — model release coordination for Command R+ and Embed/Rerank, enterprise deployment programs for Fortune 500 customers, and the operational cadence that ensures Cohere ships enterprise-grade AI products on time and at quality. You sit at the intersection of research, engineering, product, and enterprise sales, coordinating dependencies across teams that are building the AI platform Fortune 500 CISOs trust with regulated data. Founded by Aidan Gomez (Transformer co-author), Cohere's TPM culture values technical depth — you need to understand model serving latency trade-offs, retrieval pipeline architecture, and enterprise compliance requirements to effectively drive programs.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere TPM = Google L4-L5 TPM (Toronto) = Meta TPM IC4-IC5 = Amazon Sr. TPM = Databricks Senior TPM. In the Toronto market, Cohere competes with Google, Amazon, and Shopify for program management talent with AI/ML technical depth. The AI model release coordination specialization is rare and highly valued.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **Model Release Coordination Value:** "I coordinate the full lifecycle of model releases — from research completion through safety evaluation, enterprise testing, and production rollout. A botched model release can cost Cohere months of enterprise customer trust. When I run a clean Command R+ release that hits all enterprise customer SLAs and passes compliance review, I'm protecting millions in ARR. My comp should reflect this risk management value."
2. **Pre-IPO TPM Equity:** "TPMs at pre-IPO companies are often under-equitized relative to their cross-functional impact. I drive execution across 3-5 engineering teams simultaneously — my coordination work is the difference between on-time enterprise delivery and missed customer commitments. I need $160K+ in equity over four years. Google TPM in Toronto offers $150K+ in guaranteed public RSUs."
3. **Enterprise Deployment Program Management:** "I manage the deployment programs for Fortune 500 customers — coordinating security reviews, compliance certifications, infrastructure provisioning, and customer success milestones. Each enterprise deployment program I manage represents $1M+ in ARR. My program management directly de-risks Cohere's enterprise revenue pipeline."
4. **AI/ML Technical TPM Scarcity:** "The pool of TPMs who understand ML model lifecycles, inference infrastructure, and enterprise compliance is extremely small. Most TPMs come from SaaS or consumer tech — they don't understand model evaluation cadences, retrieval pipeline tuning, or on-prem GPU provisioning. My AI-native TPM expertise eliminates 3-6 months of learning curve."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning requires flawless execution — enterprise customers expect on-time model releases, reliable deployment programs, and predictable roadmap delivery. I'm the TPM who ensures that happens across multiple teams and customer programs simultaneously. I'm holding a Google TPM offer in Toronto at C$148K base with $155K RSUs over four years — C$187K+ TC guaranteed. For Cohere, I'm targeting C$155K base with $175K equity over four years. I bring direct experience managing AI model release programs and enterprise deployment coordination at [previous company], where I managed the release cadence for [ML product] serving Fortune 500 customers. My accept-at floor is C$142K base with $148K equity — below that, the Google offer's guaranteed comp and established TPM infrastructure is the pragmatic choice."
