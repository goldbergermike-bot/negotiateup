**Negotiation DNA**
Staff Software Engineers at Cohere define the technical direction of entire product lines — you set the architecture for Command R+ inference at enterprise scale, design the Embed/Rerank retrieval pipeline that makes Cohere the #1 enterprise RAG platform, and drive cross-team initiatives that translate directly into multi-million-dollar enterprise contracts. At this level, you are one of the most senior individual contributors in a company founded by Aidan Gomez, co-author of the Transformer paper, and your technical decisions shape whether Cohere maintains its enterprise RAG dominance against well-funded competitors.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere Staff SWE = Google L5 (Toronto/SF) = Meta E5 = Anthropic Senior SWE = Amazon SDE III / Principal = Apple ICT4-ICT5. In Toronto, this is the level where Google and Meta start making retention offers in the C$350K+ TC range. Cohere must compete with these guaranteed public-company packages, but your pre-IPO equity at a $5.5B+ valuation offers a fundamentally different risk/reward profile.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **Staff-Level Pre-IPO Equity Sizing:** "At Staff level, equity is the majority of my compensation. Cohere's $5.5B valuation with a $15-20B+ IPO target means my $450K+ equity grant could be worth $1.2M-$1.6M at IPO. But I need the initial grant to be sized properly — Google L5 in Toronto is offering me $350K+ in guaranteed public RSUs. I need $450K+ in pre-IPO equity to compensate for the illiquidity window and binary IPO risk."
2. **Technical Direction Ownership:** "As a Staff engineer, I'm not just writing code — I'm setting the technical direction for Cohere's core enterprise platform. When I architect the multi-cloud deployment system or the enterprise data isolation layer, I'm directly enabling the $5M+ enterprise contracts that Cohere's sales team closes. My comp should reflect that I'm a force multiplier across the entire engineering org."
3. **Scarce Talent at the Intersection:** "The intersection of distributed systems expertise, ML infrastructure experience, and enterprise compliance knowledge is exceptionally rare. There are perhaps 200 engineers in Canada who can credibly own Cohere's staff-level enterprise AI infrastructure work. Google, Meta, and Databricks are all bidding for the same talent pool."
4. **Refresh Grant Acceleration:** "Given the pre-IPO timeline, I want to discuss refresh grant mechanics. If Cohere targets an IPO within 18-24 months, my Year 2 refresh should reflect the appreciation in valuation. I'd like a commitment to an annual refresh at 25-35% of my initial grant, with the strike price locked at grant date."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm specifically choosing Cohere over public-company Staff offers because I believe Enterprise Sovereignty is the winning strategy in enterprise AI. Google L5 in Toronto is offering me C$235K base with $380K RSUs — that's C$330K+ TC guaranteed annually at a public valuation. For Cohere, I'm targeting C$235K base with $480K equity over four years. That's a $100K equity premium over Google — my price for taking pre-IPO illiquidity risk. At a $15B IPO valuation (3x from current), that equity is worth $1.3M+ versus Google's guaranteed $380K. I also want a written refresh policy of 30% of initial grant annually. My accept-at floor is C$220K base with $400K equity — below that, I take the Google L5 offer and wait for Cohere to come back with a stronger package."
