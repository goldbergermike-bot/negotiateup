**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Cohere own critical systems in the enterprise AI stack — from Command R+ serving infrastructure to the Embed/Rerank retrieval pipeline that powers RAG deployments across Fortune 500 companies. At this level, you are making architecture decisions that directly determine whether enterprise customers trust Cohere with their most sensitive, regulated data. Cohere was founded by Aidan Gomez, co-author of the Transformer paper, and its senior engineering culture reflects deep technical rigor — you are expected to drive multi-quarter technical initiatives that expand Cohere's enterprise RAG dominance.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere Senior SWE = Google L4 (Toronto) = Meta E4 = Anthropic SWE = Amazon SDE II-III = Apple ICT3-ICT4. In the Toronto market, this directly competes with Google L4, Meta E4, and Shopify Senior Engineer roles. Your pre-IPO equity at Cohere's $5.5B+ valuation carries significantly more upside potential than mature public-company RSUs at Google/Meta Toronto.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Multiplier:** "At Cohere's $5.5B valuation with a clear path to IPO, my equity grant should reflect the 2-4x upside potential. I need $280K+ in equity over four years to offset the illiquidity risk versus Google L4 public RSUs. The enterprise AI market is projected to reach $150B+ by 2028 — Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty moat means this equity could be worth significantly more at IPO."
2. **Enterprise Architecture Ownership:** "As a Senior SWE, I own architecture decisions that directly impact whether Fortune 500 customers deploy or churn. When I design the on-prem inference architecture or the multi-tenant data isolation layer, I'm enabling $1M+ ARR enterprise contracts. My comp should reflect that I'm an enterprise revenue enabler, not just a code contributor."
3. **Toronto Talent War Premium:** "The Toronto AI talent market is the most competitive in Canada. Google, Meta, Shopify, and now Cohere are all competing for senior ML-adjacent engineers. I have competing offers in the C$200K+ base range from Google Toronto (L4) and I need Cohere's offer to compete on total comp when I factor in the pre-IPO risk discount."
4. **RAG Domain Expertise:** "Enterprise RAG is Cohere's differentiator, and I bring specialized experience in retrieval systems, vector search, and document processing pipelines. This isn't commodity engineering — the pool of engineers who understand both large-scale retrieval systems and enterprise compliance requirements is extremely small."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is exactly why I want to be here — you're winning the Fortune 500 deals that OpenAI and Anthropic structurally can't win. I'm holding a Google Toronto L4 offer at C$185K base with $240K RSUs over four years — that's C$245K TC guaranteed at a public valuation. Cohere's mission is more differentiated, but I need the pre-IPO risk compensated. I'm targeting C$185K base with $300K equity over four years. The equity premium versus Google reflects the illiquidity risk — if Cohere's enterprise dominance translates to a $15B+ IPO valuation, that grant is worth $800K+. My accept-at floor is C$175K base with $250K equity — below that, the Google offer's guaranteed value is too compelling to walk away from."
