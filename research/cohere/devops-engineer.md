### DevOps Engineer | Cohere Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Competitive Base | Enterprise RAG Dominance | Enterprise Sovereignty

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$130K-C$168K | $125K-$225K | — | C$168K-C$235K |
| San Francisco | $158K-$198K | $125K-$225K | — | $189K-$254K |
| London | £115K-£148K | $125K-$225K | — | £148K-£208K |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Cohere build and operate the multi-cloud inference infrastructure that serves Command R+ and Embed/Rerank to Fortune 500 customers across AWS, GCP, Azure, and on-premises environments. This is the most demanding DevOps challenge in enterprise AI — you must deliver 99.99% uptime for LLM inference at enterprise scale while maintaining the on-prem deployment capability that makes Cohere the "safe" choice for regulated industries. Founded by Aidan Gomez (Transformer co-author), Cohere's infrastructure philosophy demands that every deployment option — cloud API, VPC, and on-premises — delivers identical performance, security, and reliability. Your work directly enables Enterprise Sovereignty.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere DevOps = Google L4 SRE (Toronto) = Meta Production Engineer IC4 = Amazon SysDE II = Shopify Senior Production Engineer. In the Toronto market, Cohere's DevOps roles compete with Google SRE, Shopify Production Engineering, and RBC's cloud infrastructure teams. Multi-cloud + on-prem AI infrastructure expertise is a niche skill set that commands a 15-20% premium over generic DevOps.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **Multi-Cloud + On-Prem AI Infrastructure Premium:** "I'm not managing a single-cloud SaaS deployment. I'm building and operating LLM inference infrastructure across AWS, GCP, Azure, AND on-premises environments — simultaneously. The multi-cloud + on-prem skill set required for enterprise AI deployment is 10x more complex than standard DevOps, and the talent pool is vanishingly small. This specialty commands a 20%+ premium over generic cloud DevOps roles."
2. **Uptime = Enterprise Revenue:** "In enterprise AI, a single outage during a Fortune 500 customer POC can kill a $2M+ deal. My infrastructure work directly protects Cohere's enterprise revenue pipeline. When I achieve 99.99% uptime across multiple deployment environments, I'm enabling the reliability SLA that enterprise procurement requires to sign contracts."
3. **Pre-IPO Infrastructure Equity:** "Infrastructure engineers at pre-IPO companies are systematically under-equitized relative to their revenue impact. I need $185K+ in equity over four years — without my infrastructure work, Cohere can't deploy to enterprise customers, and enterprise customers represent the majority of Cohere's revenue. Google SRE in Toronto offers $160K+ in guaranteed public RSUs."
4. **On-Prem Deployment Expertise:** "On-premises AI deployment is Cohere's key differentiator versus OpenAI and Anthropic — neither competitor can deploy within a customer's security perimeter. My expertise in air-gapped deployment, hardware provisioning for GPU inference, and on-prem monitoring gives Cohere a capability that directly enables its Enterprise Sovereignty positioning."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning depends on infrastructure — if you can't deploy on-prem reliably, the 'safe' alternative story falls apart. I'm the engineer who makes Enterprise Sovereignty real. I'm holding a Google SRE offer in Toronto at C$155K base with $170K RSUs over four years — C$197K+ TC guaranteed. For Cohere, I'm targeting C$160K base with $200K equity over four years. I bring direct experience deploying ML inference infrastructure on-premises for regulated enterprises at [previous company], including air-gapped environments and custom GPU provisioning. This is the hardest DevOps work in AI, and the talent pool for multi-cloud + on-prem AI infrastructure is fewer than 100 engineers in Canada. My accept-at floor is C$148K base with $165K equity — below that, I take the Google SRE role with guaranteed comp and a less complex operational surface."
