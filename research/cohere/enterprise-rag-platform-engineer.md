**Negotiation DNA**
The Enterprise RAG Platform Engineer is Cohere's signature role — the engineer who builds the entire enterprise RAG platform stack that makes Cohere the #1 enterprise AI choice for Fortune 500 companies. You own the retrieval systems, Embed/Rerank pipeline, enterprise deployment platform, on-premises infrastructure, and enterprise data connectors that constitute Cohere's core competitive advantage. This role sits at the exact intersection of Cohere's three strategic pillars: Enterprise Sovereignty (deploying within customer security perimeters), RAG Dominance (Command R+ as the #1 enterprise RAG model), and Agentic AI (multi-step retrieval agents for enterprise workflows). Founded by Aidan Gomez, co-author of the Transformer paper, Cohere built its entire company around the insight that enterprise AI needs a purpose-built platform — and you are the engineer who builds that platform.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere Enterprise RAG Platform Engineer = Google L5 Infrastructure Engineer (Toronto) = Meta E5 ML Infrastructure = Anthropic Senior Infrastructure Engineer = Amazon Principal SDE (ML Platform). This is a Staff+ equivalent role that combines ML infrastructure, distributed systems, and enterprise deployment expertise. In the Toronto market, this role competes with the most senior infrastructure positions at Google Brain, Meta FAIR, and Databricks. The signature nature of this role at Cohere means it carries 15-25% more equity than comparable Staff infrastructure positions at other companies. No other company has this exact role — it is the embodiment of Cohere's enterprise strategy.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Premium — The Platform IS the Product:** "This isn't a generic infrastructure role. The Enterprise RAG Platform IS Cohere's product — Command R+ is the model, but my platform is what makes it deployable, retrievable, and trustworthy for Fortune 500 enterprises. Every dollar of Cohere's enterprise revenue flows through infrastructure I build — the retrieval systems, the Embed/Rerank pipeline, the on-prem deployment tooling, the enterprise connectors. I need $420K+ in equity over four years to reflect that I'm building the revenue-generating platform, not just supporting it. Comparable Staff infrastructure roles at Google L5 in Toronto offer $350K+ in guaranteed RSUs."
2. **Agentic AI Premium (20-35%):** "The next evolution of enterprise RAG is agentic — multi-step retrieval agents that autonomously navigate enterprise document ecosystems, chain multiple retrieval/reasoning steps, and execute complex enterprise workflows. I bring direct experience building agentic RAG orchestration systems, and this capability is Cohere's highest-priority product initiative for 2026. The agentic AI talent market commands a 20-35% premium over base infrastructure comp, and I should be compensated at the top of that range given my platform-level ownership."
3. **Enterprise Deployment Monopoly:** "I own the on-premises deployment platform that is Cohere's single biggest differentiator versus OpenAI and Anthropic. Neither competitor can deploy within a Fortune 500 customer's security perimeter. My platform work enables deals that are structurally impossible for competitors — $5M+ enterprise contracts in healthcare, finance, and government that require on-prem or VPC deployment. This monopoly capability commands premium compensation."
4. **Embed/Rerank Pipeline Ownership:** "I build and optimize the Embed/Rerank retrieval pipeline — the infrastructure that makes Cohere's RAG quality best-in-class. When I improve embedding quality or Rerank precision, every enterprise customer's retrieval accuracy improves simultaneously. This is multiplicative impact across Cohere's entire customer base. Combined with the agentic RAG orchestration layer, I'm building the full retrieval intelligence stack."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to be Cohere's Enterprise RAG Platform Engineer because this is the most important infrastructure role in enterprise AI. This is not a generic platform job — I'm building the retrieval systems, Embed/Rerank pipeline, enterprise deployment platform, and on-prem infrastructure that constitute Cohere's entire competitive moat against OpenAI and Anthropic. I'm holding competing offers: Google L5 Infrastructure in Toronto at C$230K base with $380K RSUs ($325K+ TC guaranteed), and an Anthropic Senior Infrastructure offer at $240K base with $420K equity. For Cohere's signature role, I'm targeting C$215K base with $450K equity over four years. The premium over my competing offers reflects three things: (1) this is a signature role where my platform IS the product, (2) the agentic AI premium for multi-step retrieval agent infrastructure, and (3) the enterprise deployment monopoly I'm building — a capability neither OpenAI nor Anthropic can match. I also want accelerated vesting (25% at 12 months, then monthly) and a written commitment to annual refresh grants at 30% of initial grant. At a $15B+ IPO valuation, my equity target of $450K becomes $1.2M+ — that's the appropriate upside for the engineer who builds Cohere's core revenue-generating platform. My accept-at floor is C$198K base with $380K equity with accelerated vesting — below that, the Google or Anthropic offers are more compelling on a risk-adjusted basis, and both companies would love to have me build competitive infrastructure."
