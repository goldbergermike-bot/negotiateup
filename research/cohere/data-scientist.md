**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Cohere are the quality gatekeepers of the enterprise RAG platform — you design model evaluation frameworks, define RAG quality metrics, build enterprise benchmarks, and quantify whether Command R+ delivers accurate, grounded, and sourced answers across Fortune 500 customer deployments. This is not generic data science — you are measuring the reliability of AI systems that enterprises trust with regulated data in healthcare, finance, and government. Founded by Aidan Gomez (Transformer co-author), Cohere's data science culture is rooted in rigorous evaluation methodology that proves to enterprise CISOs and CTOs that Cohere's outputs are trustworthy and auditable.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere Data Scientist = Google L4 Data Scientist (Toronto) = Meta Data Scientist IC4 = Amazon Applied Scientist L5 = Shopify Senior Data Scientist. In the Toronto market, Cohere competes with Google Brain evaluation teams, Meta FAIR, RBC Capital Markets quant teams, and Shopify's data science org. The enterprise AI evaluation specialization is a premium niche.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **RAG Quality Metrics Ownership:** "I own the evaluation frameworks that determine whether Cohere's RAG system is enterprise-grade. When I design benchmarks for answer groundedness, citation accuracy, and hallucination rates, I'm directly influencing whether Fortune 500 customers trust Command R+ with their regulated data. If my metrics flag quality issues, we fix them before they become enterprise churn events. My comp should reflect this quality gatekeeping role."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity for Evaluation Expertise:** "Model evaluation is the bridge between AI research and enterprise revenue. I need $200K+ in equity over four years — Google Toronto offers Data Scientists $180K+ in guaranteed public RSUs. My evaluation work directly influences Cohere's enterprise credibility and customer retention rates."
3. **Enterprise Benchmark Specialization:** "I build enterprise-specific benchmarks — not academic MMLU scores, but real-world metrics like legal document retrieval accuracy, financial report summarization quality, and healthcare data extraction reliability. These custom benchmarks are what enterprise buyers use in their procurement evaluations. The pool of data scientists who can build credible enterprise AI evaluation frameworks is extremely small."
4. **Customer Trust Quantification:** "My work enables Cohere's sales team to present quantitative evidence of RAG quality to enterprise procurement committees. When I publish benchmark results showing Command R+ outperforms GPT-4 on enterprise retrieval accuracy, that directly influences $1M+ deal decisions. My data science work is a sales enablement function."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is compelling because it creates a defensible moat — and my evaluation work is what proves to Fortune 500 CISOs that the moat is real. I'm holding a Google Toronto Data Scientist offer at C$165K base with $185K RSUs over four years — C$211K+ TC guaranteed. For Cohere, I'm targeting C$165K base with $220K equity over four years. I bring specialized expertise in LLM evaluation and enterprise benchmark design from [previous company], where I built the quality frameworks for enterprise AI products serving regulated industries. My accept-at floor is C$155K base with $185K equity — below that, the Google offer's guaranteed value and established evaluation infrastructure is the safer choice."
