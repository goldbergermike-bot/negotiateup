**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Cohere are the technical face of Enterprise Sovereignty — you design and deliver RAG deployments for Fortune 500 customers, architect Command R+ integrations within enterprise security perimeters, and own the technical relationship with the most valuable enterprise accounts. You translate Cohere's AI capabilities into production architectures that satisfy enterprise CISOs, compliance teams, and IT governance boards. Founded by Aidan Gomez (Transformer co-author), Cohere's SA team is expected to combine deep technical knowledge of LLMs, retrieval systems, and enterprise infrastructure with the ability to navigate Fortune 500 procurement cycles. Your work directly converts enterprise POCs into $1M+ ARR production deployments.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere Solutions Architect = Google Customer Engineer L4-L5 (Toronto) = AWS Solutions Architect (Senior) = Databricks Solutions Architect = Snowflake Senior SA. In the Toronto market, this role competes with Google Cloud, AWS, Databricks, and Snowflake for enterprise-facing technical talent. The combination of LLM expertise and enterprise deployment experience is exceptionally rare.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **Direct Revenue Attribution:** "As an SA, I'm the technical closer for enterprise deals. When I design a RAG architecture that satisfies a Fortune 500 CISO's security requirements and passes IT governance review, I directly convert a $500K POC into a $2M+ production contract. My comp should include variable compensation tied to enterprise deployment success — I'm targeting 20% of base as a deployment bonus tied to customer go-live milestones."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity + Variable Comp Structure:** "I need a comp structure that reflects both my technical contribution (equity) and my revenue impact (variable). I'm targeting $180K+ equity over four years plus 20% variable on base. AWS Senior SA offers $150K base with $120K RSUs and 15% variable — Cohere needs to compete on total comp including the variable component."
3. **Enterprise RAG Deployment Expertise:** "I architect production RAG deployments for Fortune 500 enterprises — this means designing retrieval pipelines, tuning Embed/Rerank parameters for enterprise document collections, and configuring on-prem infrastructure for secure LLM inference. The pool of SAs who can design production-grade enterprise RAG architectures is perhaps 50 people globally. This expertise commands a significant premium."
4. **Customer Expansion Influence:** "My SA work drives net revenue retention — when I deploy Command R+ successfully in one business unit, I become the technical champion for expansion to other departments. I've driven $X million in customer expansion at [previous company]. My variable compensation should reflect this land-and-expand impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to be at Cohere because Enterprise Sovereignty is the winning position in enterprise AI — I've been on the other side of the table as an enterprise buyer, and I know that CISOs choose Cohere specifically because it deploys within their perimeter. I'm holding an AWS Senior SA offer at C$155K base with $130K RSUs, 15% variable — C$210K+ TC guaranteed. For Cohere, I'm targeting C$165K base with $190K equity over four years, plus 20% variable tied to enterprise deployment milestones. The premium reflects my specialized enterprise RAG deployment expertise and my direct impact on converting Fortune 500 POCs into production contracts. I also want to negotiate a customer success bonus — $10K per net-new $1M+ ARR deployment I architect. My accept-at floor is C$150K base with $160K equity plus 15% variable — below that, the AWS offer's guaranteed value is compelling."
