### Engineering Manager | Cohere Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Competitive Base | Enterprise RAG Dominance | Enterprise Sovereignty

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$175K-C$222K | $255K-$448K | — | C$248K-C$345K |
| San Francisco | $205K-$258K | $255K-$448K | — | $269K-$370K |
| London | £150K-£192K | $255K-$448K | — | £218K-£305K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Cohere lead teams building the enterprise AI infrastructure that Fortune 500 companies deploy behind their firewalls. You own team delivery for critical systems — Command R+ serving, Embed/Rerank pipeline, enterprise deployment tooling, or on-prem infrastructure — and your team's velocity directly determines Cohere's enterprise revenue growth. Founded by Aidan Gomez (Transformer co-author), Cohere's engineering culture is deeply technical, and EMs are expected to be hands-on technical leaders, not just people managers. You are hiring, retaining, and directing some of the most sought-after AI engineers in the Toronto and global talent markets.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere EM = Google L5 EM (Toronto) = Meta M1 = Amazon SDM II = Anthropic Engineering Manager. In Toronto, you are competing directly for the same management talent as Google Brain Toronto, Meta FAIR, and Shopify engineering leadership. Your pre-IPO equity package at Cohere's $5.5B+ valuation is the key differentiator.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **Team Output Multiplier:** "As an EM, my value isn't just my individual contribution — it's the velocity and quality of a 6-12 person engineering team. If I improve my team's output by 20%, that's equivalent to adding 1-2 additional senior engineers at C$200K+ each. My comp should reflect this multiplicative impact on Cohere's enterprise delivery capacity."
2. **Pre-IPO Management Equity:** "Engineering Managers at pre-IPO companies need equity sized to reflect both their individual contribution and their retention value. Losing an EM means losing the team — that's 3-6 months of disruption. I need $350K+ in equity over four years, with accelerated vesting if Cohere hits IPO within 24 months. Google L5 EM in Toronto is offering $320K+ in guaranteed public RSUs."
3. **Enterprise Hiring Expertise:** "Cohere's biggest bottleneck is hiring enterprise-grade AI engineers. I bring a network of 50+ senior engineers I've worked with at [previous company] and a track record of building high-performing teams that ship enterprise infrastructure. My ability to recruit and retain top talent in the Toronto AI market is worth the premium."
4. **Technical EM Premium:** "Cohere's EM role requires deep technical ownership — I'm expected to review architecture decisions, unblock engineers on distributed systems problems, and make trade-offs between model quality and serving latency. This is not a project management role. The technical EM premium in the Toronto AI market is 15-20% above generic EM comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm drawn to Cohere because Enterprise Sovereignty is the right strategic bet — Fortune 500 companies need an AI provider they can deploy within their security perimeter, and Cohere is the only company positioned to win that market. I'm holding a Google L5 EM offer in Toronto at C$210K base with $320K RSUs over four years — C$290K+ TC guaranteed. For Cohere, I need C$210K base with $380K equity over four years. The equity premium reflects the pre-IPO risk, but also my ability to recruit — I can bring 3-4 senior engineers from my current team, which eliminates $200K+ in recruiting costs and 6 months of hiring delay. I also want to discuss a management retention bonus of C$25K triggered at 18 months. My accept-at floor is C$195K base with $320K equity — below that, I take the Google EM offer."
