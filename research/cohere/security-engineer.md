### Security Engineer | Cohere Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Competitive Base | Enterprise RAG Dominance | Enterprise Sovereignty

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Toronto | C$148K-C$188K | $155K-$275K | — | C$198K-C$278K |
| San Francisco | $175K-$218K | $155K-$275K | — | $214K-$287K |
| London | £130K-£165K | $155K-$275K | — | £175K-£245K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Cohere are the foundation of Enterprise Sovereignty — you build and maintain the on-premises security architecture, data sovereignty controls, and enterprise compliance frameworks that make Cohere the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 companies. When a Fortune 500 CISO evaluates whether to deploy Cohere within their security perimeter, your work is what they evaluate. You design the data isolation layers, implement encryption-at-rest and in-transit for enterprise model inference, manage SOC 2 Type II / ISO 27001 / HIPAA compliance, and architect the air-gapped deployment security model. Founded by Aidan Gomez (Transformer co-author), Cohere's security-first enterprise positioning means your role is not support — it is the core competitive advantage.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere Security Engineer = Google L4-L5 Security Engineer (Toronto) = Meta Security Engineer IC4-IC5 = Amazon Security Engineer SDE II-III = Shopify Senior Security Engineer. In the Toronto market, Cohere competes for security talent with Google, major banks (RBC, TD, BMO), and government agencies. AI security + enterprise compliance is a premium specialization that commands 20-30% above generic application security roles.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **Enterprise Sovereignty Is Security:** "Cohere's entire competitive positioning is 'the safe AI choice for Fortune 500.' That positioning is literally my job. If our on-prem deployment has a security vulnerability, or if we fail a SOC 2 audit, Cohere loses its Enterprise Sovereignty moat. I'm not a cost center — I'm the competitive advantage. My comp should reflect that security IS the product differentiator."
2. **AI Security Specialization Premium:** "AI security is fundamentally different from application security. I need to understand prompt injection attacks, model extraction risks, data poisoning vectors, and inference-time privacy (preventing enterprise data leakage through model outputs). The pool of security engineers who understand both enterprise compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, FedRAMP) and AI-specific security risks is perhaps 100 people globally. This scarcity commands a 25-30% premium."
3. **Pre-IPO Security Equity:** "A single security incident at a pre-IPO AI company can destroy $1B+ in valuation. My security work protects Cohere's $5.5B+ valuation and its path to IPO. I need $230K+ in equity over four years — this reflects both the AI security premium and the valuation protection I provide. Google Security Engineer in Toronto offers $200K+ in guaranteed public RSUs."
4. **Compliance Revenue Enablement:** "Every enterprise compliance certification I achieve (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA, FedRAMP) directly unlocks new customer segments worth $50M+ in TAM. Without HIPAA, Cohere can't sell to healthcare. Without FedRAMP, government is closed. My compliance work is direct revenue enablement, and my comp should include a certification completion bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Enterprise Sovereignty IS security — Cohere's entire competitive moat against OpenAI and Anthropic depends on my work. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because they can deploy within their security perimeter, and I'm the engineer who makes that deployment secure. I'm holding a Google Security Engineer offer in Toronto at C$172K base with $210K RSUs over four years — C$225K+ TC guaranteed. For Cohere, I'm targeting C$182K base with $250K equity over four years. The premium reflects two things: first, AI security is a 25%+ premium specialization over generic security; second, my work directly protects Cohere's $5.5B valuation and enables entry into regulated industries. I also want a $15K compliance certification bonus for each major certification (SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP) I lead to completion. My accept-at floor is C$168K base with $210K equity — below that, the Google offer's guaranteed comp, established security infrastructure, and lower-risk profile wins."
