**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Cohere shape the enterprise AI experience that Fortune 500 developers and operators interact with daily — the Cohere Dashboard, API developer experience, RAG playground, Embed/Rerank configuration interfaces, and enterprise deployment consoles. This is not consumer UX — you are designing for enterprise CISOs, ML engineers, and Fortune 500 developers who need to trust Cohere with their most sensitive data. Founded by Aidan Gomez (Transformer co-author), Cohere's design culture demands that complex AI capabilities are made accessible to enterprise users while maintaining the security and compliance posture that regulated industries require.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere Product Designer = Google UX Designer L4 (Toronto) = Meta Product Designer IC4 = Shopify Senior Product Designer = Amazon UX Designer SDE II equivalent. In Toronto, Cohere competes for design talent with Google, Shopify, Wealthsimple, and RBC's innovation labs. Enterprise AI UX is a niche specialty — the pool of designers who understand both developer experience and enterprise compliance workflows is small.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **Enterprise UX Specialization:** "Enterprise AI UX is fundamentally different from consumer design. I'm designing for CISOs reviewing security configurations, ML engineers tuning retrieval parameters, and compliance teams auditing data flows. This requires deep understanding of enterprise workflows, regulated industry requirements, and developer experience patterns. Consumer UX designers can't do this work without 12-18 months of ramp-up."
2. **Developer Experience Revenue Impact:** "The Cohere Dashboard and API developer experience directly impact enterprise adoption velocity. When I design an intuitive RAG playground or streamline the Embed API onboarding flow, I'm reducing enterprise time-to-value from weeks to days — that directly accelerates deal velocity and reduces churn. My design work is a revenue lever."
3. **Pre-IPO Equity for Design Talent:** "Design is often under-equitized at pre-IPO startups compared to engineering. I need $130K+ in equity over four years to reflect my direct impact on enterprise adoption and retention. The enterprise dashboard I design is the product surface that CISOs evaluate during procurement — my work directly influences multi-million-dollar deal decisions."
4. **Toronto Design Market Competitiveness:** "Shopify Toronto offers Senior Product Designers C$140K+ base with generous public RSUs. Google Toronto UX Designers at L4 earn C$150K+ TC. Cohere's offer needs to compete on total comp when I factor in the pre-IPO risk discount — I need C$135K+ base to stay competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about designing the enterprise AI experience that Fortune 500 CISOs trust — Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning means the product design directly influences whether regulated enterprises adopt or reject the platform. I'm holding a Shopify Senior Product Designer offer at C$140K base with $100K RSUs over four years at a public valuation. For Cohere, I'm targeting C$138K base with $145K equity over four years. The equity premium reflects both the pre-IPO risk and my specialized enterprise UX expertise — I've designed enterprise security dashboards and developer APIs at [previous company] that drove 40% improvement in enterprise onboarding velocity. My accept-at floor is C$128K base with $120K equity — below that, the Shopify offer's guaranteed value and work-life balance is the safer bet."
