**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Cohere build the RAG data pipelines, Embed/Rerank infrastructure, and enterprise data connectors that power the #1 enterprise RAG platform. You design and operate the systems that ingest, process, embed, and index enterprise document collections at scale — from legal contracts and medical records to financial reports and government documents. Your pipelines are what make Command R+ deliver grounded, sourced answers from enterprise data, and your enterprise data connectors (SharePoint, Confluence, Salesforce, SAP) are what make Cohere deployable inside Fortune 500 data ecosystems. Founded by Aidan Gomez (Transformer co-author), Cohere's data engineering culture demands building pipelines that handle the most sensitive enterprise data with zero data leakage.

**Level Mapping:** Cohere Data Engineer = Google L4 Data Engineer (Toronto) = Meta Data Engineer IC4 = Amazon Data Engineer SDE II = Databricks Senior Data Engineer = Shopify Senior Data Engineer. In the Toronto market, Cohere competes with Google, Shopify, major banks, and increasingly with Databricks and Snowflake for data engineering talent with ML pipeline expertise.

**Enterprise Sovereignty — The "Safe" Fortune 500 Alternative**
Cohere is the "safe" AI choice for Fortune 500 enterprises. While OpenAI and Anthropic are consumer-facing, generate headlines, and raise regulatory concerns, Cohere is enterprise-first, privacy-focused, and deployable within any security perimeter — on-premises, private cloud, or VPC. Fortune 500 CISOs choose Cohere because it's the only frontier AI they can fully control. I build the enterprise AI platform that CISOs trust with their most sensitive data. When negotiating, frame your value as: "I'm not building a chatbot. I'm building the AI platform that Fortune 500 companies trust with regulated data — healthcare, finance, government. Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning is why we win deals OpenAI can't. My comp should reflect that I'm enabling the highest-value enterprise AI contracts in the market."

**Global Levers**
1. **RAG Pipeline Ownership:** "I build the data pipelines that make enterprise RAG work — document ingestion, chunking, embedding (via Cohere Embed), indexing, and retrieval optimization. Without my pipelines, Command R+ can't deliver grounded, sourced answers from enterprise data. Every Fortune 500 RAG deployment depends on my data engineering work. My comp should reflect that I'm building the infrastructure that makes Cohere's #1 product actually function."
2. **Enterprise Data Connector Revenue Impact:** "Each enterprise data connector I build (SharePoint, Confluence, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow) unlocks a new category of enterprise customers. A SharePoint connector alone opens Cohere to 80% of Fortune 500 companies. My connector work is direct TAM expansion — each connector I ship enables $10M+ in addressable enterprise revenue."
3. **Pre-IPO Data Infrastructure Equity:** "Data engineers at pre-IPO AI companies are systematically under-equitized. I need $170K+ in equity over four years — my pipeline work is the foundation of Cohere's enterprise RAG product, and without it, there is no enterprise revenue. Databricks Toronto offers Senior Data Engineers $155K+ in guaranteed public RSUs."
4. **Enterprise Data Security Expertise:** "Building data pipelines for regulated enterprise data requires security-aware engineering — data residency compliance, encryption-in-transit for document processing, access control at the document level, and audit logging for compliance. This is not generic ETL work. The pool of data engineers who can build secure, compliant ML data pipelines for regulated industries is very small."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Cohere's Enterprise Sovereignty positioning depends on enterprise data integration — if you can't connect to a Fortune 500's document ecosystem securely, the RAG product doesn't work. I'm the engineer who makes enterprise RAG real by building the data pipelines and connectors that integrate Cohere into enterprise data environments. I'm holding a Databricks Data Engineer offer in Toronto at C$150K base with $160K RSUs over four years — C$190K+ TC guaranteed. For Cohere, I'm targeting C$155K base with $185K equity over four years. I bring direct experience building enterprise data connectors and secure ML pipelines at [previous company], including SOC 2 compliant document processing pipelines for healthcare and financial services. My accept-at floor is C$142K base with $155K equity — below that, the Databricks offer with guaranteed public comp and established data infrastructure is more compelling."
