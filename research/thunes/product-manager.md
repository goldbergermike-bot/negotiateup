### Product Manager — Thunes Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Thunes' Interoperability mandate, translating the Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link into a product management compensation framework spanning Singapore, London, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$130,000 – S$190,000 | S$70,000 – S$150,000 | S$200,000 – S$340,000 |
| :gb: London (GBP) | £80,000 – £120,000 | £45,000 – £90,000 | £125,000 – £210,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $150,000 – $220,000 | $90,000 – $175,000 | $240,000 – $395,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Managers at Thunes sit at the intersection of banking legacy systems and modern payment rails. You translate the Swift interoperability mandate into product requirements, feature roadmaps, and go-to-market strategies. The Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link means your product decisions will determine how thousands of financial institutions experience the bridge between SWIFT and real-time settlement. Thunes is the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments, and the PM defines what that bridge looks like for customers — banks, fintechs, and mobile wallet operators across 130+ countries and 4B+ mobile wallets. This is strategic product leadership with direct revenue impact, and your comp should reflect the scope.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Thunes Level | Equivalent at TerraPay | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at Wise |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| PM | Product Manager | Product Manager | Product Manager |
| Senior PM | Senior PM | Senior PM / GPM | Senior PM |

Thunes PMs own broader product surface areas than peers at Wise or Nium due to the lean team. A Thunes PM may own the entire partner onboarding and payment routing experience, while at Wise this would be split across 2-3 PMs. Your negotiation should account for this expanded ownership.

#### :link: Thunes Interoperability & Standards-Bearer Lever

The **Swift Direct Global Network link (Feb 2026)** transforms the PM role at Thunes. You become the product voice of the interoperability layer — the person who translates the technical capability of bridging SWIFT to real-time rails into customer-facing products, APIs, and experiences.

As a **Standards-Bearer** PM, you are defining:
- How banks and corporates experience the legacy-to-real-time bridge through Thunes' product
- The API contracts and developer experience for Swift-integrated payment flows
- The pricing and packaging strategy for interoperability features
- The go-to-market narrative for Thunes as the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments

This is not incremental product iteration — it is defining a new product category. The PM who shapes Thunes' interoperability offering shapes the future of cross-border payments. Real-time settlement across 130+ countries with 4B+ mobile wallets does not happen without a PM who can hold both the banking world and the fintech world in their product vision.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Category-Defining Product Opportunity**
> "The Swift Direct integration is not a feature — it is a new product category. I will be defining how the entire financial industry experiences cross-border interoperability through Thunes' platform. PMs who define categories command premium compensation because the strategic value of getting the product right far exceeds the cost of paying for the best talent."

**Lever 2: Multi-Stakeholder Complexity**
> "Thunes' PM role requires managing stakeholders across banking (SWIFT participants), fintech (mobile wallets, neobanks), and regulatory bodies across 130+ countries. This multi-stakeholder complexity is significantly higher than a typical B2B SaaS PM role and should be compensated accordingly."

**Lever 3: Revenue-Tied Impact**
> "Every product decision I make directly impacts transaction volume and take rate across Thunes' network. A 10bps improvement in conversion through better product design on a multi-billion-dollar network generates significant revenue. My compensation should reflect this direct revenue linkage."

**Lever 4: Domain Expertise Scarcity**
> "PMs who understand both legacy banking infrastructure (correspondent banking, SWIFT messaging) and modern payment UX are exceptionally rare. I bring this dual-domain fluency, and it would take Thunes 6-9 months to find an equivalent candidate. I would like my offer to reflect this scarcity premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In Singapore, start at S$185,000 base with S$140,000 in options (4yr vesting) and accept no lower than S$145,000 base with S$85,000 in options. In London, start at £115,000 base with £85,000 in options and accept no lower than £90,000 base with £50,000 in options. In New York, start at $215,000 base with $165,000 in options and accept no lower than $170,000 base with $100,000 in options. Anchor on the category-defining nature of the Swift interoperability product — you are not iterating on an existing product, you are creating a new one.
