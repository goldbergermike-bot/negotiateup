### Engineering Manager — Thunes Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Thunes' Interoperability mandate, translating the Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link into an engineering management compensation framework spanning Singapore, London, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$160,000 – S$230,000 | S$100,000 – S$200,000 | S$260,000 – S$430,000 |
| :gb: London (GBP) | £100,000 – £145,000 | £60,000 – £120,000 | £160,000 – £265,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $185,000 – $260,000 | $120,000 – $230,000 | $305,000 – $490,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering Managers at Thunes carry a dual mandate: ship reliable payment infrastructure AND build the teams capable of executing the Swift interoperability integration. With the Feb 2026 deadline, your ability to recruit, retain, and align engineers around the legacy-to-real-time bridge is a strategic capability, not just people management. Thunes is the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments, and you are hiring for Standards-Bearer competencies — engineers who can straddle both SWIFT protocols and modern API architectures across 130+ countries and 4B+ mobile wallets. This talent strategy role deserves compensation at the top of fintech EM benchmarks.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Thunes Level | Equivalent at TerraPay | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at Wise |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| EM | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager |
| Senior EM | Director of Eng | Senior EM | Senior EM / Director |

Thunes EMs typically manage 6-12 engineers across multiple payment corridors, compared to 4-8 at Wise or Nium. The lean org structure means you are both a people leader and a technical contributor — most Thunes EMs are expected to be hands-on 30-40% of the time. This dual expectation should be priced accordingly.

#### :link: Thunes Interoperability & Standards-Bearer Lever

The **Swift Direct Global Network link (Feb 2026)** creates an inflection point for engineering leadership at Thunes. As the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments, Thunes needs EMs who can:

- Build and lead teams with dual-protocol expertise (legacy banking + modern real-time systems)
- Manage the complexity of integrating with Swift's infrastructure while maintaining 99.99% uptime on existing rails
- Recruit **Standards-Bearer** engineers — the rare talent who understand both correspondent banking and mobile wallet APIs
- Navigate the organizational tension between maintaining legacy integrations and building the real-time bridge

As a Standards-Bearer EM, you are not just managing engineers — you are the talent strategy architect for Thunes' most important capability. The legacy-to-real-time bridge requires specific hiring profiles, training investments, and team structures that only an EM with domain expertise can design. With real-time settlement across 130+ countries and 4B+ mobile wallets at stake, your leadership decisions have direct revenue implications.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Talent Strategy for Interoperability**
> "Building the Swift interoperability layer requires a specific talent profile — engineers who understand both legacy financial messaging and modern distributed systems. I bring a track record of identifying, recruiting, and developing this exact profile. My talent strategy directly de-risks the Feb 2026 Swift integration timeline."

**Lever 2: Delivery Risk Mitigation**
> "The Swift Direct integration is time-bound and mission-critical. An experienced EM reduces delivery risk by 40-60% compared to a first-time manager or an external hire who needs ramp time. I can hit the ground running with team formation, sprint planning, and cross-functional coordination — that de-risking is worth a premium."

**Lever 3: Technical Depth + People Leadership**
> "At Thunes' scale, EMs need to be both technically credible and organizationally effective. I bring hands-on experience with payment systems and a track record of building high-performing teams. This combination is rare — most EMs skew technical or managerial, not both — and it is exactly what the interoperability mandate demands."

**Lever 4: Equity Aligned to Team Output**
> "My options grant should reflect not just my individual contribution but the output multiplier I create across my team. A well-led team of 8-10 engineers shipping the Swift integration on time is worth more to Thunes than any individual contributor. I am looking for an equity package that recognizes this leverage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In Singapore, start at S$220,000 base with S$185,000 in options (4yr vesting) and accept no lower than S$175,000 base with S$115,000 in options. In London, start at £140,000 base with £110,000 in options and accept no lower than £110,000 base with £70,000 in options. In New York, start at $250,000 base with $215,000 in options and accept no lower than $200,000 base with $135,000 in options. Lead with the talent strategy angle — you are not just managing engineers, you are building the team that will deliver Thunes' most important strategic initiative.
