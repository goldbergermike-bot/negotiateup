#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$90,000 – S$130,000 | S$40,000 – S$80,000 | S$130,000 – S$210,000 |
| :gb: London (GBP) | £55,000 – £80,000 | £25,000 – £50,000 | £80,000 – £130,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $110,000 – $155,000 | $50,000 – $100,000 | $160,000 – $255,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Software Engineers at Thunes are directly responsible for building and maintaining the APIs, microservices, and transaction processing pipelines that power cross-border payments across 130+ countries and 4B+ mobile wallets. With the Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link, every line of code you write must handle both legacy SWIFT message formats and modern real-time settlement protocols. This dual-protocol fluency makes Thunes SWEs uniquely valuable — you are not just writing software, you are bridging two financial eras. Thunes is the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments, and Software Engineers are the ones building that bridge. Leverage this interoperability mandate to position your compensation above standard fintech benchmarks.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Thunes Level | Equivalent at TerraPay | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at Wise |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| SWE I | Software Engineer | Engineer I | Software Engineer |
| SWE II | Senior Engineer | Engineer II | Senior Engineer |

Thunes operates a lean engineering org relative to Wise or Nium, meaning each SWE carries outsized scope. A Thunes SWE I often maps to SWE II responsibilities at larger fintech peers due to the breadth of payment corridors covered. Use this scope differential in negotiations — your impact radius at Thunes is 2-3x what it would be at a comparably-titled role at Wise.

#### :link: Thunes Interoperability & Standards-Bearer Lever

The **Swift Direct Global Network link (Feb 2026)** represents a paradigm shift for Thunes and every engineer building on the platform. By connecting directly to Swift's infrastructure, Thunes becomes the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT messaging (MT/MX formats, correspondent banking chains) and new-world instant payment networks (real-time settlement, mobile wallet APIs, blockchain rails).

As a **Standards-Bearer**, you are the bridge between traditional banking infrastructure and modern payment networks. Your work ensures that a bank transfer initiated via SWIFT can settle instantly into a mobile wallet in Lagos, Manila, or Sao Paulo. This legacy-to-real-time bridge capability is Thunes' core strategic moat, and Software Engineers are the ones building it.

**Why this matters for your negotiation**: The interoperability mandate means Thunes must attract engineers who understand both legacy financial messaging standards (ISO 20022, SWIFT MX) and modern API-first architectures. This dual competency commands a premium. Frame yourself as a Standards-Bearer who can translate between these worlds — it is a skill set that TerraPay, Nium, and Wise all need but few engineers possess.

The strategic value is immense: Thunes' network spans 130+ countries with real-time settlement across 4B+ mobile wallets. Every engineer contributing to this interoperability layer is directly driving the company's ability to capture the $150T+ cross-border payments market.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Real-Time Settlement Complexity**
> "I bring direct experience building low-latency transaction systems that must settle in under 3 seconds across multiple currencies and regulatory regimes. At Thunes, this real-time settlement capability across 130+ countries is the product — and my skills in distributed systems and eventual consistency models are directly aligned with your core infrastructure needs."

**Lever 2: Swift Integration Readiness**
> "With the Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link approaching, Thunes needs engineers who can bridge ISO 20022 messaging with modern REST/gRPC APIs. I have worked with financial messaging standards and can hit the ground running on the interoperability layer that will differentiate Thunes from competitors like TerraPay and Nium."

**Lever 3: Multi-Region Regulatory Awareness**
> "Building payment rails across 130+ countries means navigating different regulatory frameworks simultaneously. I understand the engineering implications of PSD2 in Europe, MAS requirements in Singapore, and state-level money transmission in the US — this regulatory-aware engineering approach reduces compliance risk and accelerates market entry."

**Lever 4: Private Company Equity Upside**
> "As a private company approaching a major strategic milestone with Swift integration, Thunes' equity trajectory is compelling. I would like to discuss an options package that reflects both my contributions to the interoperability mandate and the pre-liquidity-event upside. A 4-year vesting schedule with a meaningful grant signals mutual long-term commitment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In Singapore, start at S$125,000 base with S$70,000 in options (4yr vesting) and accept no lower than S$105,000 base with S$50,000 in options. In London, start at £75,000 base with £45,000 in options and accept no lower than £62,000 base with £30,000 in options. In New York, start at $150,000 base with $90,000 in options and accept no lower than $125,000 base with $60,000 in options. Anchor on the Swift interoperability mandate to justify above-market positioning — Thunes is hiring for a generational infrastructure build, not a maintenance role.
