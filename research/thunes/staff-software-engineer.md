### Staff Software Engineer — Thunes Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Thunes' Interoperability mandate, translating the Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link into a staff-level engineering compensation framework spanning Singapore, London, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$185,000 – S$260,000 | S$150,000 – S$300,000 | S$335,000 – S$560,000 |
| :gb: London (GBP) | £115,000 – £160,000 | £90,000 – £180,000 | £205,000 – £340,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $210,000 – $290,000 | $180,000 – $350,000 | $390,000 – $640,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Staff Software Engineers at Thunes do not just write code — they define the architectural DNA of the entire cross-border payments platform. With the Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link, the Staff SWE role becomes the nexus of Thunes' most important strategic bet: becoming the interoperability standard between legacy banking and real-time payments. Thunes is the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments, and at the Staff level you drive the technical vision for protocol translation, define the system boundaries, and mentor the engineering teams building this bridge across 130+ countries and 4B+ mobile wallets. Your compensation must reflect both the technical depth and organizational breadth of this mandate.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Thunes Level | Equivalent at TerraPay | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at Wise |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Staff SWE | Principal Engineer | Staff / Principal | Staff Engineer |
| Staff SWE (Distinguished) | CTO Office | VP Engineering | Principal Engineer |

At Thunes' scale, a Staff SWE wields influence comparable to a Principal Engineer or even VP Engineering at larger fintech peers. You are one of a handful of technical leaders setting the architectural direction for a network that processes billions in cross-border volume. TerraPay and Nium have deeper engineering benches but less network reach — your leverage is that every architectural decision you make scales to 130+ countries instantly.

#### :link: Thunes Interoperability & Standards-Bearer Lever

The **Swift Direct Global Network link (Feb 2026)** is the defining project of your tenure as Staff SWE at Thunes. This initiative positions Thunes as the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT infrastructure (correspondent banking, batch settlement, MT message formats) and new-world instant payment networks (real-time APIs, mobile wallets, sub-second settlement).

As the **Standards-Bearer** at the Staff level, you are responsible for the architectural vision of this legacy-to-real-time bridge. This means:
- Designing the protocol translation architecture (SWIFT MT/MX to ISO 20022 to real-time APIs)
- Defining system boundaries between legacy adapters and modern microservices
- Setting reliability and latency SLAs for cross-protocol transactions
- Mentoring Senior and mid-level engineers on interoperability patterns
- Influencing Thunes' contribution to industry standards bodies

The strategic value cannot be overstated: Thunes is building the Rosetta Stone of payments. Every bank, mobile wallet, and fintech in 130+ countries will route through infrastructure you design. Real-time settlement across 4B+ mobile wallets does not happen without your architecture. This is a once-in-a-career opportunity to architect the interoperability standard for global payments, and your compensation should reflect it.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Architectural Authority Premium**
> "As Staff SWE, I will be setting the technical direction for the Swift interoperability layer — the most critical infrastructure initiative in Thunes' roadmap. This is CTO-adjacent architectural authority, and I expect my compensation to reflect that. I am benchmarking against Principal Engineer roles at Wise and Nium, adjusted upward for the scope of the interoperability mandate."

**Lever 2: Standards Body Influence**
> "Part of my value is representing Thunes in industry standards conversations — ISO 20022 migration, real-time payment interoperability frameworks, and Swift integration specifications. This external influence amplifies Thunes' strategic positioning and is a lever that goes beyond pure engineering output."

**Lever 3: Pre-IPO Equity Maximization**
> "At the Staff level, my 4-year vesting window perfectly brackets the Swift integration timeline and any potential liquidity event. I am looking for an options grant that reflects my architectural impact on company valuation — specifically, a grant in the top decile for Staff SWEs at pre-IPO fintech companies."

**Lever 4: Retention Cost Asymmetry**
> "Replacing a Staff SWE with my domain expertise in cross-border payment protocols and Swift integration would cost Thunes 12-18 months of recruiting and onboarding. The retention cost far exceeds the delta between a median and top-quartile offer. I would encourage us to get the comp right from day one."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In Singapore, start at S$250,000 base with S$280,000 in options (4yr vesting) and accept no lower than S$200,000 base with S$170,000 in options. In London, start at £155,000 base with £170,000 in options and accept no lower than £125,000 base with £100,000 in options. In New York, start at $280,000 base with $330,000 in options and accept no lower than $225,000 base with $200,000 in options. At the Staff level, lead with the architectural authority argument and pre-IPO equity upside — you are defining the interoperability standard, not filling a seat.
