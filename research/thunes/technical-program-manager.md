#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$140,000 – S$200,000 | S$70,000 – S$140,000 | S$210,000 – S$340,000 |
| :gb: London (GBP) | £85,000 – £125,000 | £45,000 – £85,000 | £130,000 – £210,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Technical Program Managers at Thunes orchestrate the most complex cross-functional initiatives in global payments. When Thunes onboards a new corridor, launches a new payment method, or integrates with a strategic partner, the TPM is the central node coordinating engineering, product, compliance, operations, and partner teams across time zones. Thunes is the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments, and the TPM is the person who keeps the trains running as that bridge gets built. With 130+ countries, 4B+ mobile wallets, and partners depending on timely delivery, the TPM's ability to drive execution directly determines whether Thunes captures market opportunities or loses them.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Thunes Level | Equivalent at TerraPay | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at Wise |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| TPM | TPM | Program Manager | Program Manager |
| Senior TPM | Senior TPM | Senior PM | Senior Program Manager |

Thunes TPMs manage programs that span more regulatory jurisdictions and payment protocols than peers at Wise or Nium. A single program at Thunes may involve coordination across MAS (Singapore), FCA (UK), FinCEN (US), and emerging market regulators simultaneously. This multi-jurisdictional complexity commands premium compensation.

#### :link: Thunes Interoperability & Standards-Bearer Lever

The **Swift Direct Global Network link (Feb 2026)** is the highest-stakes program in Thunes' history. It involves SWIFT's institutional stakeholders, Thunes' engineering teams, regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions, and partner readiness coordination — all with a hard delivery timeline.

As a **Standards-Bearer** TPM, you orchestrate the legacy-to-real-time bridge:
- Coordinating the multi-quarter Swift integration program across engineering, compliance, and partner teams
- Managing dependencies between SWIFT's institutional timeline and Thunes' agile delivery cycles
- Driving readiness across 130+ countries for the interoperability layer launch
- Ensuring that the bridge between traditional banking infrastructure and modern payment networks ships on time and at quality

The critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments does not build itself — it takes a TPM who can manage complexity across cultural, organizational, and technical boundaries. Real-time settlement across 4B+ mobile wallets requires flawless program execution, and you are the person accountable for that execution. The Standards-Bearer premium for TPMs is the ability to manage institutional-grade programs (SWIFT timelines, banking compliance) alongside agile engineering delivery.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Swift Program Orchestration**
> "I will be the TPM driving the Swift Direct Global Network link integration — a multi-quarter program coordinating SWIFT's institutional stakeholders, Thunes' engineering organization, compliance teams across multiple jurisdictions, and partner readiness. This is the most complex cross-organizational program in Thunes' history, and my execution track record with programs of this institutional complexity justifies top-quartile compensation."

**Lever 2: Delivery Risk Reduction**
> "The Swift Direct integration has a hard Feb 2026 timeline. An experienced TPM reduces delivery risk measurably — every month of delay costs Thunes revenue from the interoperability layer. I can hit the ground running with program structure, milestone tracking, and cross-functional coordination."

**Lever 3: Cross-Jurisdictional Program Expertise**
> "Managing programs that span regulatory regimes from MAS in Singapore to the FCA in London requires specialized knowledge. I bring cross-jurisdictional program management experience, which is rare and directly relevant to Thunes' multi-market interoperability mandate."

**Lever 4: Program Delivery as Valuation Driver**
> "Program execution velocity — how quickly Thunes can ship integrations, launch corridors, and onboard partners — is a key growth metric. The programs I deliver directly impact the growth narrative. I would like an options package that reflects this execution-layer contribution to enterprise value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In Singapore, start at S$195,000 base with S$130,000 in options (4yr vesting) and accept no lower than S$155,000 base with S$80,000 in options. In London, start at £120,000 base with £80,000 in options and accept no lower than £95,000 base with £50,000 in options. In New York, start at $215,000 base with $150,000 in options and accept no lower than $170,000 base with $90,000 in options. Lead with the Swift program orchestration angle — you are driving the most consequential program in Thunes' history, and that warrants top-of-market compensation.
