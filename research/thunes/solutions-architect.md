### Solutions Architect — Thunes Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Thunes' Interoperability mandate, translating the Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link into a solutions architecture compensation framework spanning Singapore, London, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$150,000 – S$210,000 | S$80,000 – S$160,000 | S$230,000 – S$370,000 |
| :gb: London (GBP) | £90,000 – £135,000 | £50,000 – £100,000 | £140,000 – £235,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $165,000 – $230,000 | $90,000 – $175,000 | $255,000 – $405,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Solutions Architects at Thunes are the technical face of the company to its most important partners. When PayPal, Western Union, Grab, or a regional mobile money operator evaluates Thunes for cross-border payout integration, the Solutions Architect designs the technical implementation — mapping Thunes' API capabilities to the partner's infrastructure, defining corridor configurations, and architecting the integration across 130+ countries and 4B+ mobile wallets. Thunes is the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments, and the Solutions Architect is the person who makes that interoperability tangible for each partner. This is not a generic pre-sales role; it requires deep understanding of payment protocols, settlement flows, regulatory requirements, and the operational realities of money movement across emerging markets.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Thunes Level | Equivalent at TerraPay | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at Wise |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect | Integration Architect |
| Senior SA | Senior SA | Senior SA | Senior Integration Architect |

Thunes Solutions Architects manage more diverse partner integration patterns than peers at Wise or Nium. A single SA may work with SWIFT-connected banks, mobile money operators, and digital wallet providers simultaneously — each with fundamentally different integration paradigms. This breadth commands premium compensation.

#### :link: Thunes Interoperability & Standards-Bearer Lever

The **Swift Direct Global Network link (Feb 2026)** brings an entirely new partner category to the Solutions Architect's portfolio: SWIFT-connected banking institutions. These partners have fundamentally different technical requirements, compliance frameworks, and integration patterns than digital-native partners.

As a **Standards-Bearer** Solutions Architect, you are the interoperability translator:
- Designing integration architectures that bridge SWIFT's ISO 20022 messaging with Thunes' real-time APIs
- Onboarding traditional banking institutions to the legacy-to-real-time bridge
- Creating integration patterns that work across both old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payment paradigms
- Advising partners on how to leverage Thunes as the critical interoperability layer between traditional banking infrastructure and modern payment networks

Every partner integration you architect generates recurring transaction revenue across 130+ countries and 4B+ mobile wallets. Your Solutions Architecture work directly builds the network effects that make Thunes more valuable with each new integration. The Standards-Bearer premium is that you can speak both languages — banking and fintech — and design integrations that bridge them.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: SWIFT Partner Onboarding Expertise**
> "I will be architecting the integration patterns for SWIFT-connected banking institutions onboarding to Thunes via the Swift Direct Global Network link. These banks have ISO 20022 compliance requirements, specific security frameworks, and integration timelines measured in months. The technical and relationship complexity of this work — bridging SWIFT's institutional world with Thunes' API-first platform — is a specialized skill that commands premium compensation."

**Lever 2: Revenue Attribution**
> "Every partner integration I architect generates recurring transaction revenue. Solutions Architects who directly drive partner revenue at this scale are more valuable than typical pre-sales roles. I would like the options grant to reflect my direct revenue impact across the network."

**Lever 3: Cross-Protocol Integration Design**
> "The Swift integration means I need to design solutions that work across both legacy banking protocols and modern real-time APIs simultaneously. This cross-protocol integration design expertise is rare — most Solutions Architects specialize in one paradigm. My ability to bridge both is the interoperability premium."

**Lever 4: Partner Count as Valuation Driver**
> "Partner count and integration velocity are headline metrics for any payments company approaching a valuation event. With the SWIFT partnership expanding the addressable partner universe, every integration I architect adds to the growth narrative. I would like options that capture this contribution to enterprise value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In Singapore, start at S$205,000 base with S$150,000 in options (4yr vesting) and accept no lower than S$165,000 base with S$95,000 in options. In London, start at £130,000 base with £95,000 in options and accept no lower than £100,000 base with £58,000 in options. In New York, start at $225,000 base with $165,000 in options and accept no lower than $180,000 base with $100,000 in options. Lead with revenue attribution — every partner integration you architect generates recurring transaction revenue, making your impact directly measurable.
