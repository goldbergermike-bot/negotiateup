### Senior Software Engineer — Thunes Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Thunes' Interoperability mandate, translating the Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link into a senior software engineering compensation framework spanning Singapore, London, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$130,000 – S$185,000 | S$80,000 – S$150,000 | S$210,000 – S$335,000 |
| :gb: London (GBP) | £80,000 – £115,000 | £50,000 – £90,000 | £130,000 – £205,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $155,000 – $210,000 | $100,000 – $180,000 | $255,000 – $390,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Senior Software Engineers at Thunes are the technical backbone of the payments network. You design and build the systems that route billions in transaction volume across heterogeneous payment networks — from SWIFT correspondent banking to mobile money APIs. The Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link elevates your role: you will be architecting the interoperability layer that makes Thunes the translation engine between legacy and modern rails. This is not incremental feature work — it is foundational infrastructure that will define the company's next decade. As the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments, Thunes needs Senior SWEs who can own entire subsystems end-to-end across 130+ countries and 4B+ mobile wallets. Your compensation must reflect the architectural ownership and cross-protocol expertise this demands.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Thunes Level | Equivalent at TerraPay | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at Wise |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Senior SWE | Senior Engineer | Senior Engineer | Senior Engineer / Tech Lead |
| Senior SWE (Lead) | Tech Lead | Staff Engineer | Staff Engineer |

Thunes Senior SWEs frequently operate with Staff-level scope at larger organizations. The lean team structure means you own entire payment corridors end-to-end, from API ingestion through settlement. At Wise, this scope would be distributed across 3-4 engineers. Use this leverage — your title may say "Senior" but your impact says "Staff."

#### :link: Thunes Interoperability & Standards-Bearer Lever

The **Swift Direct Global Network link (Feb 2026)** is the most consequential infrastructure initiative in Thunes' history. By plugging directly into Swift's messaging backbone, Thunes becomes the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT (correspondent banking, MT103/MT202 messages, multi-day settlement) and new-world instant payments (real-time APIs, mobile wallet credits, sub-second settlement).

As a **Standards-Bearer** Senior SWE, you are the architect of the legacy-to-real-time bridge. You will design the protocol translation layers, build the message transformation pipelines (MT to MX to ISO 20022), and ensure that a corporate treasury payment initiated via SWIFT settles into a GCash wallet in the Philippines in real time. This is the interoperability mandate — and Senior SWEs are the ones who make it technically possible.

**Why this matters for your negotiation**: The Swift integration demands engineers who can hold both worlds in their heads simultaneously. You need deep knowledge of legacy banking protocols AND modern distributed systems. This dual-stack expertise is rare and commands a significant premium. Competitors like TerraPay and Nium are racing to build similar bridges but lack Thunes' network scale (130+ countries, 4B+ mobile wallets). Position yourself as the Standards-Bearer who can deliver on this interoperability promise — it is a career-defining opportunity and your comp should match.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Architectural Ownership of Interoperability Layer**
> "At the Senior level, I will be designing the systems that translate between SWIFT messaging and real-time payment APIs. This architectural ownership of the interoperability layer is foundational to Thunes' Swift Direct integration — it is not feature work, it is platform-defining work, and my compensation should reflect that level of technical responsibility."

**Lever 2: Cross-Protocol Expertise Premium**
> "I bring rare dual-stack expertise: I understand both legacy financial messaging (SWIFT MT/MX, ISO 20022) and modern microservice architectures. This combination is exactly what Thunes needs for the Feb 2026 Swift integration, and it commands a premium above standard Senior SWE benchmarks at fintech companies."

**Lever 3: Retention Through Pre-Liquidity Equity**
> "Thunes is private with a clear path to significant valuation growth as the Swift interoperability play materializes. I would like to discuss an options package in the top quartile for Senior SWEs — the 4-year vesting aligns perfectly with the Swift integration timeline, and a meaningful grant ensures I am incentivized to see this through."

**Lever 4: Scope-to-Title Arbitrage**
> "Based on my research, Thunes Senior SWEs operate with Staff-level scope at companies like Wise or Nium. I am willing to take the Senior title if the compensation reflects the actual scope — specifically, I am looking for comp that benchmarks to the 60th-75th percentile for Staff Engineers at comparable fintech companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In Singapore, start at S$180,000 base with S$140,000 in options (4yr vesting) and accept no lower than S$145,000 base with S$90,000 in options. In London, start at £110,000 base with £85,000 in options and accept no lower than £88,000 base with £55,000 in options. In New York, start at $205,000 base with $170,000 in options and accept no lower than $170,000 base with $110,000 in options. Lead with the Swift interoperability mandate and scope-to-title arbitrage — you are building the bridge between two financial eras, not maintaining a CRUD app.
