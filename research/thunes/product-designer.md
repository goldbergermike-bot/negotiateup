### Product Designer — Thunes Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Thunes' Interoperability mandate, translating the Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link into a product design compensation framework spanning Singapore, London, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$100,000 – S$150,000 | S$45,000 – S$90,000 | S$145,000 – S$240,000 |
| :gb: London (GBP) | £60,000 – £95,000 | £30,000 – £55,000 | £90,000 – £150,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $120,000 – $175,000 | $55,000 – $110,000 | $175,000 – $285,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Designers at Thunes face a unique challenge: making the invisible visible. Cross-border payment routing, real-time settlement status, currency conversion, and compliance flows must be designed so that a treasury manager in Frankfurt and a mobile wallet operator in Nairobi can both navigate the platform with confidence. The Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link adds a new design dimension — you will be creating the interface for the legacy-to-real-time bridge, making the interoperability between SWIFT and instant payments feel seamless. Thunes is the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments, and the designer shapes how 130+ countries and 4B+ mobile wallets experience that bridge. This complexity premium should be reflected in your compensation.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Thunes Level | Equivalent at TerraPay | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at Wise |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Product Designer | Product Designer | Product Designer | Product Designer |
| Senior Designer | Senior Designer | Senior / Lead | Senior Designer |

Thunes designers operate with more autonomy than peers at Wise, where design teams are larger and more specialized. At Thunes, you will own the end-to-end design of entire payment flows, from partner onboarding through transaction monitoring. This breadth should be factored into your compensation expectations.

#### :link: Thunes Interoperability & Standards-Bearer Lever

The **Swift Direct Global Network link (Feb 2026)** creates an entirely new design challenge: how do you visually represent the interoperability between old-world SWIFT messaging and new-world real-time settlement? This is the critical interoperability layer between traditional banking infrastructure and modern payment networks, and it needs a design language.

As a **Standards-Bearer** designer, you are creating:
- The visual framework for how legacy banking transactions (SWIFT) transform into real-time settlements
- Dashboard experiences that surface the health of 130+ country corridors and 4B+ mobile wallet connections
- Onboarding flows that help traditional banks understand and adopt the legacy-to-real-time bridge
- Design systems that scale across Singapore, London, New York, and emerging market contexts

The interoperability mandate means designing for two audiences simultaneously: traditional bankers who think in SWIFT messages and batch settlement, and fintech operators who expect real-time APIs and mobile-first experiences. Bridging this UX gap is your Standards-Bearer contribution, and it is a design challenge few companies in the world can offer.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Complexity-to-Clarity Translation**
> "Designing for cross-border payment interoperability is an order of magnitude more complex than typical B2B SaaS design. I will be translating multi-protocol payment routing, real-time settlement status, and regulatory compliance across 130+ countries into intuitive interfaces. This complexity-to-clarity skill is rare and should be compensated above standard fintech design benchmarks."

**Lever 2: Dual-Audience Design Expertise**
> "The Swift integration means designing for both legacy banking users and modern fintech operators simultaneously. I have experience designing for institutional and consumer audiences, which is exactly the dual-audience competency Thunes needs for the interoperability layer."

**Lever 3: Design System Scale**
> "A design system that works across 130+ countries, multiple currencies, and diverse regulatory contexts requires deep localization and scalability expertise. I bring experience building design systems for global products, which will accelerate Thunes' ability to onboard new corridors and partners."

**Lever 4: Revenue-Impacting UX Decisions**
> "In payments, UX directly impacts conversion and transaction volume. A 5% improvement in payment flow completion rates across Thunes' network translates to millions in additional revenue. My design decisions have direct commercial impact, and I would like my comp to reflect that value creation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In Singapore, start at S$145,000 base with S$85,000 in options (4yr vesting) and accept no lower than S$115,000 base with S$55,000 in options. In London, start at £90,000 base with £50,000 in options and accept no lower than £70,000 base with £35,000 in options. In New York, start at $170,000 base with $100,000 in options and accept no lower than $135,000 base with $65,000 in options. Lead with the complexity-to-clarity argument — designing the interoperability layer between SWIFT and real-time payments is a world-class design challenge that few companies offer.
