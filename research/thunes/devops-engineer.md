### DevOps Engineer — Thunes Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Thunes' Interoperability mandate, translating the Feb 2026 Swift Direct Global Network link into a DevOps engineering compensation framework spanning Singapore, London, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$110,000 – S$165,000 | S$55,000 – S$110,000 | S$165,000 – S$275,000 |
| :gb: London (GBP) | £65,000 – £105,000 | £35,000 – £65,000 | £100,000 – £170,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $125,000 – $185,000 | $60,000 – $120,000 | $185,000 – $305,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: DevOps Engineers at Thunes are responsible for the infrastructure that keeps real-time cross-border payments flowing across 130+ countries and 4B+ mobile wallets — 24/7, with zero tolerance for downtime. When PayPal, Western Union, or Grab routes a payout through Thunes, the infrastructure must deliver sub-second response times regardless of whether the destination is a bank account in London, an M-Pesa wallet in Kenya, or a GCash wallet in the Philippines. Thunes is the critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments, and the DevOps team is what makes that bridge reliable. This is financial infrastructure where every minute of downtime means failed payments, stuck funds, and regulatory consequences. Your compensation must reflect this operational criticality.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Thunes Level | Equivalent at TerraPay | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at Wise |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| DevOps Engineer | DevOps Engineer | Platform Engineer | Platform Engineer |
| Senior DevOps | Senior DevOps | Senior Platform Eng | Senior Platform Eng |

Thunes DevOps engineers carry broader infrastructure scope than peers at Wise or Nium, managing heterogeneous systems that span legacy banking connectivity and modern cloud-native microservices. The on-call responsibility across 130+ country corridors adds a complexity layer that typical fintech DevOps roles do not have.

#### :link: Thunes Interoperability & Standards-Bearer Lever

The **Swift Direct Global Network link (Feb 2026)** amplifies the DevOps challenge significantly. By connecting to Swift's infrastructure, Thunes must maintain infrastructure that bridges SWIFT's institutional messaging network with its own real-time API platform. This means operating hybrid infrastructure across two fundamentally different technical paradigms — batch-oriented banking systems and event-driven digital payment systems.

As a **Standards-Bearer** DevOps Engineer, you are the guardian of the legacy-to-real-time bridge's operational reliability:
- Building CI/CD pipelines that deploy safely across both legacy SWIFT adapters and modern microservices
- Maintaining 99.99% uptime across the interoperability layer spanning 130+ countries
- Designing failover and disaster recovery systems that work across protocol boundaries
- Implementing observability that correlates events across SWIFT messaging and real-time API flows

The critical interoperability layer between old-world SWIFT and new-world instant payments is only as good as its uptime. Real-time settlement across 4B+ mobile wallets demands infrastructure that never sleeps, and you are the one who ensures it does not. This operational Standards-Bearer responsibility commands a premium over standard DevOps roles.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Hybrid Infrastructure Complexity**
> "The Swift Direct Global Network link requires maintaining infrastructure that bridges SWIFT's batch-oriented banking systems with Thunes' event-driven real-time platform. This hybrid infrastructure complexity — two fundamentally different operational paradigms running in production simultaneously — is significantly more demanding than a standard cloud-native DevOps role. I would like the base to reflect this dual-paradigm operational responsibility."

**Lever 2: Five-Nines Financial Infrastructure**
> "Thunes processes real-time payments for partners like PayPal and Western Union. Five-nines availability is not aspirational — it is a contractual requirement. My experience maintaining financial-grade infrastructure with sub-second latency SLAs across multiple regions directly de-risks Thunes' operational commitments."

**Lever 3: On-Call Premium for Global Coverage**
> "Supporting payment infrastructure across 130+ countries means 24/7 on-call coverage with regulatory consequences for outages. I would like to negotiate an on-call stipend of $1,500-$2,000/month on top of base compensation, plus incident response bonuses, reflecting the operational criticality of this role."

**Lever 4: Pre-IPO Infrastructure Ownership**
> "Infrastructure reliability metrics — uptime, latency percentiles, incident frequency — are key due diligence items for IPO readiness. The infrastructure I build and maintain directly impacts Thunes' ability to pass institutional scrutiny. I would like an options package that reflects this foundational contribution to company value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In Singapore, start at S$160,000 base with S$100,000 in options (4yr vesting) and accept no lower than S$130,000 base with S$65,000 in options. In London, start at £100,000 base with £60,000 in options and accept no lower than £78,000 base with £40,000 in options. In New York, start at $180,000 base with $110,000 in options and accept no lower than $145,000 base with $70,000 in options. Lead with the hybrid infrastructure argument and the on-call premium — you are keeping the legacy-to-real-time bridge operational 24/7 across 130+ countries.
