### DevOps Engineer | Snowflake AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | Cortex AI Platform Pivot | CEO-Led AI Transformation | TOP-OF-MARKET Initial Grants

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo / Bozeman | $170K–$210K | $185K–$298K | None | $216K–$285K |
| Seattle | $164K–$204K | $178K–$285K | None | $208K–$275K |
| Warsaw | PLN 290K–435K | PLN 158K–272K | None | PLN 448K–707K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Snowflake AI DevOps Engineers build and maintain the CI/CD pipelines, deployment infrastructure, and reliability systems that ensure Cortex AI delivers enterprise-grade uptime and performance. In February 2026, as Snowflake scales AI workloads across thousands of enterprise customers, DevOps reliability is the foundation that determines whether Cortex AI can handle production AI workloads. Snowflake pays TOP-OF-MARKET initial RSU grants with NO annual cash bonus — DevOps engineers must maximize the initial equity grant.

Cortex AI's credibility as an enterprise platform depends on the infrastructure you build — a single reliability failure in AI workloads can cost enterprise deals worth millions.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake DevOps = Google L3-L4 SRE = Meta Production Engineer E3-E4 = Amazon L4-L5 SDE

### 🏗️ Snowflake Cortex AI Reliability Lever
In February 2026, Snowflake is scaling Cortex AI to handle enterprise AI workloads — LLM inference, model training, and real-time AI applications — all requiring new DevOps patterns that differ significantly from traditional data warehouse operations. DevOps Engineers are building the deployment and monitoring infrastructure that makes Cortex AI production-ready.

Your infrastructure directly determines Cortex AI's enterprise readiness — every deployment pipeline improvement and reliability enhancement you build enables Snowflake to onboard more enterprise AI customers with confidence.

**Global Levers**

1. **Top-of-Market Equity Anchor:** "Snowflake's top-of-market initial grants are the primary reason I'm considering this role. I expect RSUs reflecting the critical nature of DevOps for the Cortex AI platform."
2. **AI Infrastructure Reliability:** "Cortex AI's enterprise credibility depends on infrastructure reliability. I build the systems that ensure AI workloads run at five-nines — this directly impacts enterprise adoption."
3. **Cloud Provider Counter:** "I have offers from AWS/GCP/Azure with strong base + bonus structures. Snowflake's equity-only model needs the initial grant to exceed what I'd earn in guaranteed cash elsewhere."
4. **Refresh Risk Mitigation:** "Without bonuses and with smaller refresh grants, my initial RSU grant is essentially my total variable comp. I need $285K+ RSUs to offset the structural comp risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $290K over 4 years. Cortex AI can't be enterprise-grade without reliable deployment infrastructure — I build that. I have competitive offers from cloud providers with guaranteed bonuses. Snowflake's initial grant must compensate for the no-bonus structure." Accept if above $268K RSUs.
