**Negotiation DNA**

Snowflake AI Security Engineers protect the Data Cloud and Cortex AI platform — ensuring that enterprise AI workloads, sensitive data, and ML models are secured against threats while maintaining compliance with global regulations. In February 2026, as enterprises run AI models on their most sensitive data within Snowflake, security is the single biggest concern for CISOs evaluating the platform. Security Engineers who can secure AI workloads at enterprise scale are rare and command premium compensation. Snowflake pays TOP-OF-MARKET initial RSU grants with NO annual cash bonus.

AI security is an emerging discipline — securing LLM inference, model training data, and AI agent outputs requires new approaches that few security engineers have experience with. This scarcity creates exceptional leverage.

### 🏗️ Snowflake Cortex AI Security Lever
In February 2026, Cortex AI introduces entirely new security challenges — enterprises running LLMs on sensitive data, fine-tuning models with proprietary information, and deploying AI agents that access critical systems. Security Engineers are building the security frameworks, access controls, and compliance guardrails that make enterprises confident enough to run AI workloads on Snowflake.

Your security architecture directly determines enterprise trust — a single security incident in AI workloads could cost Snowflake hundreds of millions in enterprise contracts. The security you build is the foundation of enterprise AI adoption.

**Global Levers**

1. **Top-of-Market Equity — Security Premium:** "AI security engineers who can secure enterprise AI platforms are the rarest talent in security. I expect RSUs at $345K+ over 4 years reflecting this scarcity."
2. **Enterprise Trust Foundation:** "Enterprises won't run AI on sensitive data without ironclad security. I build the security framework that enables every Cortex AI enterprise deal — my work unlocks revenue."
3. **Cloud Security Counter:** "I have offers from AWS/GCP/Azure security teams with strong base + bonus + on-call pay. Snowflake's equity-only model needs a premium initial grant to compete."
4. **AI Security Scarcity:** "Security engineers with AI/ML security expertise are the scarcest talent in the market. I'm not just a security engineer — I secure AI platforms. This premium must be reflected in RSUs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $350K over 4 years. I secure the Cortex AI platform that enterprises trust with their most sensitive data — without this security, there are no enterprise AI deals. I have cloud provider offers with guaranteed bonuses. Snowflake's initial grant must reflect the AI security premium." Accept if above $325K RSUs.
