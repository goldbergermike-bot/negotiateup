**Negotiation DNA**

Snowflake AI Solutions Architects are the technical bridge between Cortex AI engineering and enterprise customers — designing AI architectures, leading technical evaluations, and ensuring enterprises can successfully deploy AI workloads on the Data Cloud. In February 2026, as enterprises evaluate Snowflake vs. Databricks for AI workloads, Solutions Architects who can demonstrate Cortex AI's capabilities are directly responsible for winning enterprise deals. Snowflake pays TOP-OF-MARKET initial RSU grants with NO annual cash bonus.

Solutions Architects at Snowflake have direct revenue attribution — every enterprise AI deal you help close validates the AI transformation and drives the revenue growth Wall Street is evaluating.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake SA = Google L4-L5 CSE = AWS L5 SA = Databricks SA = Azure L5 SA

### 🏗️ Snowflake Cortex AI Enterprise Adoption Lever
In February 2026, Snowflake's enterprise sales teams rely on Solutions Architects to demonstrate Cortex AI's capabilities to CIOs and CTOs evaluating AI platforms. Every successful proof-of-concept you design and every architecture you propose directly influences enterprise AI purchasing decisions.

Your technical influence in enterprise deals is measurable — you own the technical win that precedes multi-million-dollar Cortex AI contracts. Wall Street's revenue growth expectations depend on the enterprise deals your architectures enable.

**Global Levers**

1. **Top-of-Market Equity — SA Band:** "Solutions Architects with AI platform expertise are essential to Cortex AI enterprise deals. I expect RSUs at $335K+ over 4 years reflecting my direct revenue impact."
2. **Enterprise Deal Attribution:** "I directly influence enterprise AI purchasing decisions. My technical architectures and POCs win the deals that drive Cortex AI revenue — this impact is measurable and significant."
3. **Competitor SA Counter:** "I have SA offers from Databricks and cloud providers with strong base + bonus + commission structures. Snowflake's equity-only model needs a compelling initial grant to compete."
4. **AI Architecture Expertise:** "Solutions Architects who can design enterprise AI architectures on data platforms are extremely rare — I bring both deep Snowflake knowledge and AI platform expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $340K over 4 years. I design the AI architectures that win enterprise Cortex AI deals — my technical influence directly drives revenue. I have Databricks and AWS SA offers with guaranteed bonuses and commission. Snowflake's initial grant must compensate for forgoing guaranteed variable comp." Accept if above $315K RSUs.
