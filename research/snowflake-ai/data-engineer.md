### Data Engineer | Snowflake AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | Cortex AI Platform Pivot | CEO-Led AI Transformation | TOP-OF-MARKET Initial Grants

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo / Bozeman | $172K–$215K | $195K–$310K | None | $220K–$292K |
| Seattle | $165K–$208K | $185K–$295K | None | $212K–$282K |
| Warsaw | PLN 295K–445K | PLN 165K–285K | None | PLN 460K–730K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Snowflake AI Data Engineers build and optimize the core data infrastructure that powers Cortex AI — designing the pipelines, storage layers, and compute frameworks that enable enterprises to run AI workloads natively within the Data Cloud. In February 2026, CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy's AI transformation strategy requires Data Engineers who can architect the foundational data layer that Cortex AI depends on. Snowflake pays TOP-OF-MARKET initial RSU grants with NO annual cash bonus — your initial equity negotiation determines your comp trajectory for 2-3 years.

The convergence of data engineering and AI inside Snowflake creates a unique leverage point — Data Engineers who understand both the warehouse internals and AI workload requirements are critical to making Cortex AI performant at enterprise scale.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake DE = Google L3-L4 = Meta E3-E4 = Databricks DE = Amazon L4-L5

### 🏗️ Snowflake Cortex AI Data Infrastructure Lever
In February 2026, Snowflake's Cortex AI platform requires a robust data foundation — Data Engineers are building the pipelines that feed AI models, optimizing storage for vector embeddings, and ensuring that enterprises can run ML workloads without data movement. Every performance improvement in the data layer directly impacts Cortex AI's competitiveness against Databricks.

Your data infrastructure work is the foundation that determines whether Cortex AI can deliver enterprise-grade performance — Wall Street's re-rating of Snowflake depends on AI workloads running efficiently on data you engineer.

**Global Levers**

1. **Top-of-Market Equity Anchor:** "Snowflake pays top-of-market initial grants and I expect my offer to reflect this — my data engineering expertise directly enables Cortex AI's performance at scale."
2. **AI Data Infrastructure Scarcity:** "Data Engineers who understand both warehouse internals and AI workload optimization are exceptionally rare. I bring both — this combination is exactly what Cortex AI needs."
3. **Databricks Data Engineering Counter:** "I have a Databricks offer with pre-IPO equity at $62B+ valuation. Their data engineering team is building competing AI infrastructure — Snowflake must make the initial grant compelling."
4. **Refresh Grant Risk — Front-Load Equity:** "Snowflake's refresh grants are smaller than initial grants. I need the strongest possible initial equity position because this grant defines my comp for the next 2-3 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $295K over 4 years. My data engineering skills are foundational to Cortex AI — without performant data infrastructure, the AI platform can't compete. I have a Databricks offer with pre-IPO equity that's very compelling. I need the initial grant to reflect the critical nature of this role." Accept if above $275K RSUs.
