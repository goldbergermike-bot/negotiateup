**Negotiation DNA**

Snowflake AI Technical Program Managers orchestrate the cross-functional execution of Cortex AI — coordinating across ML engineering, platform engineering, product, design, and infrastructure teams to deliver AI features on schedule and at enterprise quality. In February 2026, TPMs on Cortex AI are managing the most complex programs at Snowflake, with dependencies spanning dozens of teams and external partners. Snowflake pays TOP-OF-MARKET initial RSU grants with NO annual cash bonus.

TPMs on the AI transformation manage programs with higher complexity and more cross-team dependencies than anywhere else at Snowflake — the coordination challenges of AI platform development demand experienced program managers.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake TPM = Google L5 TPM = Meta TPM IC5 = Amazon L6 TPM = Databricks TPM

### 🏗️ Snowflake Cortex AI Program Execution Lever
In February 2026, Cortex AI program execution is one of Snowflake's biggest challenges — coordinating ML model development, platform infrastructure, security reviews, enterprise customer feedback, and competitive feature parity across global teams. TPMs who can manage this complexity ensure the AI roadmap ships on time and at quality.

Your program management directly determines whether Cortex AI features reach customers on schedule — delayed AI features mean lost enterprise deals and missed competitive windows against Databricks. Execution velocity is everything.

**Global Levers**

1. **Top-of-Market Equity — TPM Band:** "TPMs managing Cortex AI programs coordinate the most complex cross-functional work at Snowflake. I expect RSUs at $342K+ over 4 years reflecting this program complexity."
2. **AI Program Complexity Premium:** "Cortex AI programs have more cross-team dependencies, more technical complexity, and higher stakes than traditional Snowflake programs. My AI program management expertise commands a premium."
3. **Big Tech TPM Counter:** "Google and Meta TPMs receive 15-20% annual bonuses plus strong RSU refreshes. Snowflake's no-bonus structure means the initial grant must overcompensate — I need $342K+ RSUs."
4. **Execution Velocity = Revenue:** "Delayed Cortex AI features mean lost enterprise deals. My program management ensures features ship on time — this directly protects revenue and competitive positioning."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $345K over 4 years. I manage the most complex programs at Snowflake — Cortex AI execution across dozens of teams. Delayed features mean lost enterprise deals. I have Google and Meta TPM offers with strong guaranteed bonuses. Snowflake's initial grant must compensate for the no-bonus structure." Accept if above $320K RSUs.
