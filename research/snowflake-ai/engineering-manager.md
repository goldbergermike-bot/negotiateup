### Engineering Manager | Snowflake AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | Cortex AI Platform Pivot | CEO-Led AI Transformation | TOP-OF-MARKET Initial Grants

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo / Bozeman | $225K–$282K | $340K–$530K | None | $310K–$415K |
| Seattle | $218K–$272K | $325K–$508K | None | $300K–$400K |
| Warsaw | PLN 405K–595K | PLN 288K–465K | None | PLN 693K–1,060K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Snowflake AI Engineering Managers lead the teams building Cortex AI — owning delivery timelines, hiring strategies, and technical execution for the AI features that determine whether Snowflake's transformation succeeds. In February 2026, EMs on Cortex AI teams are among the most strategically important leaders at the company, responsible for scaling engineering teams during the AI pivot while maintaining velocity on enterprise-critical features. Snowflake pays TOP-OF-MARKET initial RSU grants with NO annual cash bonus.

At the EM level, the initial equity grant is even more consequential — your leadership directly impacts team output, feature velocity, and the enterprise AI roadmap that drives Snowflake's revenue growth.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake EM = Google L6 EM = Meta M1 = Databricks EM = Amazon L6 SDM

### 🏗️ Snowflake Cortex AI Team Scaling Lever
In February 2026, Snowflake is aggressively scaling its Cortex AI engineering teams — the company is competing with Databricks, cloud providers, and AI startups for top AI talent. Engineering Managers who can recruit, retain, and lead AI-focused teams are essential to the transformation's success.

Your team's output directly determines the Cortex AI roadmap velocity — every feature your team ships drives enterprise adoption and validates the AI pivot thesis that Wall Street is evaluating.

**Global Levers**

1. **Top-of-Market Equity — EM Band:** "I'm leading a Cortex AI team through the most important transformation in Snowflake's history. I expect RSUs at $510K+ over 4 years — top of the EM band."
2. **AI Team Leadership Scarcity:** "Engineering Managers who can lead AI platform teams and recruit top AI talent are extremely scarce. My leadership directly determines your Cortex AI roadmap velocity."
3. **Databricks EM Counter:** "Databricks is offering pre-IPO equity at $62B+ for EM roles. Their AI platform is Snowflake's primary competitor — my decision to join Snowflake must be reflected in the initial grant."
4. **EM Refresh Risk — Critical Initial Grant:** "At the EM level, refresh grants represent a smaller percentage of initial grants. I need the largest possible upfront equity to compensate for structural comp limitations."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $520K over 4 years. I'm leading the Cortex AI team through Snowflake's most critical transformation — my team's output drives the AI roadmap. I have a Databricks EM offer with pre-IPO equity. The initial grant must reflect both the strategic leadership role and competitive market." Accept if above $485K RSUs.
