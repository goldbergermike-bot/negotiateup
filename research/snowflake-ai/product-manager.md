**Negotiation DNA**

Snowflake AI Product Managers define the Cortex AI product roadmap — prioritizing which AI capabilities to build, how to package them for enterprise customers, and how to differentiate against Databricks and cloud-native AI platforms. In February 2026, PMs on Cortex AI are among the most influential roles at Snowflake, directly shaping the AI strategy that determines the company's next growth phase. Snowflake pays TOP-OF-MARKET initial RSU grants with NO annual cash bonus.

Cortex AI PMs own the product-market fit decisions for the AI transformation — every prioritization choice you make determines whether Snowflake wins or loses enterprise AI workloads against increasingly aggressive competitors.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake PM = Google L5 PM = Meta IC5 PM = Databricks PM = Amazon L6 PMT

### 🏗️ Snowflake Cortex AI Product Strategy Lever
In February 2026, Snowflake's Cortex AI product roadmap is being defined by Product Managers who balance enterprise customer needs, competitive positioning against Databricks, and the technical capabilities of the AI platform. These product decisions directly determine revenue growth and market positioning.

Your roadmap decisions shape the AI features that enterprise customers evaluate — every product choice you make either wins or loses enterprise AI workloads, making PMs directly responsible for the AI pivot's commercial success.

**Global Levers**

1. **Top-of-Market Equity — PM Band:** "Snowflake PMs on Cortex AI define the AI product strategy. I expect RSUs at $415K+ over 4 years — top of the PM equity band for this strategic role."
2. **AI Product Strategy Ownership:** "I own the Cortex AI product roadmap — every prioritization decision determines whether Snowflake wins enterprise AI workloads. This direct revenue impact must be reflected in compensation."
3. **Databricks PM Counter:** "Databricks is offering PM roles with pre-IPO equity at $62B+. As a Cortex AI PM, I'd be competing directly against Databricks — Snowflake must make the offer compelling enough to choose this side."
4. **No Bonus — PM Equity Premium:** "PM roles at Google and Meta include 15-20% annual bonuses. Without bonuses at Snowflake, the initial RSU grant must compensate — I need $415K+ RSUs to match total comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $420K over 4 years. I'm defining the Cortex AI product roadmap — the strategic decisions that determine whether Snowflake wins enterprise AI. I have a Databricks PM offer with pre-IPO equity. The initial grant must reflect both the product leadership responsibility and competitive offers." Accept if above $392K RSUs.
