### ML/AI Engineer | Snowflake AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | Cortex AI Platform Pivot | CEO-Led AI Transformation | TOP-OF-MARKET Initial Grants

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo / Bozeman | $192K–$248K | $250K–$408K | None | $255K–$350K |
| Seattle | $185K–$240K | $238K–$392K | None | $245K–$338K |
| Warsaw | PLN 340K–510K | PLN 215K–368K | None | PLN 555K–878K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Snowflake AI ML/AI Engineers are the most strategically critical hires in the company's history — directly building the Cortex AI models, LLM integrations, RAG pipelines, and AI agent frameworks that transform Snowflake from a data warehouse into an AI Data Cloud. In February 2026, CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy has made AI engineering the top hiring priority, and ML/AI Engineers command premium equity packages. Snowflake pays TOP-OF-MARKET initial RSU grants with NO annual cash bonus.

ML/AI Engineers at Snowflake have asymmetric leverage because the entire AI pivot depends on their work — every Cortex AI capability shipped is a direct result of ML/AI engineering, making this the highest-leverage role at the company.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake ML/AI = Google L4 ML = Meta ML E4 = Databricks ML = Amazon L5 Applied Scientist

### 🏗️ Snowflake Cortex AI Core ML Lever
In February 2026, Cortex AI's core ML capabilities — including LLM serving, fine-tuning, vector search, and AI agents — are being built by ML/AI Engineers who are defining the platform's technical differentiation. This is the engineering work that determines whether enterprises run their AI workloads on Snowflake or migrate to Databricks.

Your ML architecture decisions become the product — every model optimization, every inference improvement, every new AI capability you build is what customers evaluate when comparing Snowflake's AI platform to competitors.

**Global Levers**

1. **Top-of-Market Equity — ML/AI Premium:** "ML/AI Engineers building Cortex AI are the most critical hires at Snowflake right now. I expect RSUs at $395K+ over 4 years — reflecting the AI premium and top-of-market positioning."
2. **Cortex AI Core Builder:** "I build the core ML capabilities — LLM serving, fine-tuning, AI agents — that ARE Cortex AI. Without my work, there is no AI pivot. This direct impact must be reflected in compensation."
3. **AI Startup Equity Counter:** "I have offers from AI startups with pre-IPO equity that could 5-10x on exit. Snowflake's initial grant must compensate for the asymmetric upside I'm forgoing."
4. **ML/AI Talent War — Maximize Offer:** "The ML/AI talent market in February 2026 is the most competitive in tech history. Every AI company is competing for the same engineers — Snowflake's offer must be top-of-market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $400K over 4 years. I'm building the core ML capabilities that ARE Cortex AI — the entire AI transformation depends on this work. I have AI startup offers with pre-IPO equity offering significant upside. Snowflake's initial grant must reflect both the strategic importance and the competitive AI talent market." Accept if above $375K RSUs.
