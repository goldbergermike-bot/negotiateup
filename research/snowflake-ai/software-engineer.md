### Software Engineer | Snowflake AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | Cortex AI Platform Pivot | CEO-Led AI Transformation | TOP-OF-MARKET Initial Grants

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo / Bozeman | $168K–$205K | $185K–$292K | None | $215K–$278K |
| Seattle | $162K–$198K | $175K–$275K | None | $208K–$268K |
| Warsaw | PLN 285K–430K | PLN 155K–268K | None | PLN 440K–698K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Snowflake AI Software Engineers build the Cortex AI platform that is transforming Snowflake from a data warehouse into an AI Data Cloud — powering Cortex AI functions, Snowpark ML, Document AI, and the intelligent data applications that enterprise customers are demanding in 2026. Under CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy's leadership, the AI transformation is the #1 strategic priority, and every SWE shipping AI features is at the center of this pivot. Snowflake pays TOP-OF-MARKET initial RSU grants but has NO annual cash bonus — your initial equity negotiation is the most critical comp decision of your Snowflake career.

Snowflake's stock has shown recovery momentum as the Cortex AI pivot gains enterprise traction — joining during the AI transformation creates asymmetric equity upside if Cortex AI drives the next phase of revenue growth.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake SWE = Google L3 = Meta E3 = Databricks SWE = Amazon L4-L5

### 🏗️ Snowflake Cortex AI Platform Lever
In February 2026, Snowflake's Cortex AI platform is the centerpiece of the company's transformation — delivering AI functions natively within the Data Cloud, enabling enterprises to run LLMs, build ML models, and deploy AI applications without moving data outside Snowflake. Software Engineers building Cortex AI are directly responsible for the product capabilities that determine whether the AI pivot succeeds.

Your code on Cortex AI directly drives the AI revenue that Wall Street is using to re-rate Snowflake — every AI feature you ship demonstrates the platform's AI capabilities and drives enterprise adoption of the AI Data Cloud.

**Global Levers**

1. **Top-of-Market Equity Anchor:** "Snowflake is known for paying top-of-market initial grants. I expect the offer to reflect this reputation — I want to be at the top of the equity band given my AI platform experience."
2. **Cortex AI Pivot Value:** "I'm joining at the inflection point of Snowflake's Cortex AI transformation. The AI pivot is the #1 strategic priority — my work directly determines whether the market re-rates Snowflake as an AI company."
3. **Databricks Pre-IPO Counter-Offer:** "I have a Databricks offer with pre-IPO equity at $62B+ valuation that could appreciate significantly on IPO. Snowflake must make the initial grant compelling enough to forgo pre-IPO upside."
4. **Weak Refresh Warning — Maximize Initial Grant:** "Snowflake's refresh grants are smaller relative to initial grants. I need the largest possible initial grant because my equity position for the next 2-3 years depends almost entirely on this negotiation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $275K over 4 years. Snowflake's top-of-market reputation is important to me, and Cortex AI is why I'm excited about this role. I'm also in process with Databricks where the pre-IPO equity at $62B+ valuation is very compelling. I need to see the initial grant reflect the AI transformation opportunity." Accept if above $252K RSUs.
