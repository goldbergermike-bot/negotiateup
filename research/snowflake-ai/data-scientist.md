**Negotiation DNA**

Snowflake AI Data Scientists design and deploy the ML models, analytics frameworks, and AI-powered insights that showcase Cortex AI's enterprise capabilities — demonstrating to customers that Snowflake's Data Cloud can serve as their primary AI platform. In February 2026, as enterprises evaluate whether to consolidate AI workloads on Snowflake or Databricks, Data Scientists who can build compelling AI applications within Cortex are essential to winning enterprise deals. Snowflake pays TOP-OF-MARKET initial RSU grants with NO annual cash bonus.

Data Scientists at Snowflake sit at the intersection of product and research — every model you deploy within Cortex AI becomes a reference implementation that enterprise customers use to evaluate the platform's AI capabilities.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake DS = Google L3-L4 DS = Meta DS IC3-IC4 = Databricks DS = Amazon L4-L5 DS

### 🏗️ Snowflake Cortex AI Intelligence Lever
In February 2026, Snowflake's Cortex AI platform needs Data Scientists who can build enterprise-grade ML models and AI applications natively within the Data Cloud — from LLM fine-tuning to predictive analytics to anomaly detection. These capabilities directly determine whether enterprises choose Snowflake over Databricks for their AI workloads.

Your models and AI applications become the proof points that enterprise sales teams use to close deals — every successful Cortex AI deployment you build drives revenue growth and validates the AI transformation thesis.

**Global Levers**

1. **Top-of-Market Equity — DS Band:** "Snowflake's top-of-market reputation matters to me. I expect RSUs at the top of the DS band given my ML and AI platform experience."
2. **Cortex AI Application Builder:** "I build the AI applications and ML models that enterprises use to evaluate Cortex AI. My work directly drives enterprise adoption and revenue — this is the output Wall Street is watching."
3. **Databricks DS Counter-Offer:** "Databricks is offering pre-IPO equity at $62B+ with their own ML platform push. I need Snowflake's initial grant to compensate for forgoing that pre-IPO upside."
4. **No Bonus — Equity Must Compensate:** "Without an annual bonus, my initial RSU grant is my entire variable comp for 2-3 years. I need $320K+ RSUs to make the total package competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $325K over 4 years. I'm building the AI models and applications that prove Cortex AI works at enterprise scale — this is the #1 strategic priority. I have a Databricks DS offer with pre-IPO equity. Snowflake's initial grant must reflect both the strategic importance and the competitive market." Accept if above $298K RSUs.
