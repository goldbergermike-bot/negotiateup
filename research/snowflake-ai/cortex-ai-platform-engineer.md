### Cortex AI Platform Engineer | Snowflake AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | Cortex AI Platform Pivot | CEO-Led AI Transformation | TOP-OF-MARKET Initial Grants

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo / Bozeman | $198K–$255K | $265K–$430K | None | $265K–$362K |
| Seattle | $190K–$248K | $252K–$415K | None | $253K–$352K |
| Warsaw | PLN 348K–525K | PLN 228K–388K | None | PLN 576K–913K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Snowflake Cortex AI Platform Engineers are the specialized engineers building the core Cortex AI runtime — the model serving infrastructure, AI function execution engine, and platform APIs that enable enterprises to run LLMs, deploy AI agents, and build intelligent applications natively within the Data Cloud. In February 2026, this role is the single most critical engineering position at Snowflake — every Cortex AI capability depends on the platform these engineers build. Snowflake pays TOP-OF-MARKET initial RSU grants with NO annual cash bonus.

Cortex AI Platform Engineers operate at the intersection of distributed systems, ML infrastructure, and enterprise platform design — a combination so rare that Snowflake competes directly with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind for this talent. The premium reflects the scarcity.

**Level Mapping:** Snowflake Cortex Platform = Google L4-L5 ML Infra = Meta ML Platform E4-E5 = Databricks Platform = Amazon L5-L6 ML Infra

### 🏗️ Snowflake Cortex AI Platform Core Lever
In February 2026, Cortex AI Platform Engineers are building the infrastructure that IS the AI Data Cloud — model serving at enterprise scale, AI function execution with sub-second latency, vector search with billion-row performance, and AI agent orchestration with enterprise security. This is the engineering that determines whether Snowflake's AI pivot succeeds.

Your platform engineering becomes the product — every performance optimization, every scalability improvement, every new platform capability directly determines what AI experiences enterprise customers can build on Snowflake.

**Global Levers**

1. **Top-of-Market Equity — Platform Premium:** "Cortex AI Platform Engineers build the core AI infrastructure. I expect RSUs at $420K+ over 4 years — the highest band for this specialized role."
2. **Platform = Product:** "I build the Cortex AI runtime — model serving, AI functions, vector search. Without my platform work, Cortex AI doesn't exist. This direct product impact must be reflected in compensation."
3. **AI Lab Counter-Offer:** "I have offers from OpenAI and Anthropic with significant equity. These AI labs are building the most important AI infrastructure in the world — Snowflake must match the opportunity cost."
4. **Specialized Talent Scarcity:** "Engineers who can build enterprise AI platforms with distributed systems expertise are the scarcest talent in tech. I bring exactly this combination — the offer must reflect the market reality."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $425K over 4 years. I'm building the Cortex AI platform runtime — the core infrastructure that IS the AI Data Cloud. Without this platform work, Cortex AI doesn't exist. I have offers from OpenAI and Anthropic. Snowflake's initial grant must reflect both the platform criticality and AI lab competition." Accept if above $395K RSUs.
