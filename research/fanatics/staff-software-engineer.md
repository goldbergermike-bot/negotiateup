Staff Software Engineers at Fanatics define the technical strategy for major platform areas — commerce infrastructure, manufacturing integration, sports betting, or collectibles technology. At Staff level, pre-IPO equity becomes the dominant comp lever, and Fanatics has been willing to offer large equity packages to attract Staff-level talent from FAANG companies. Your architectural decisions shape the technology platform for a sports commerce monopoly during a critical pre-IPO period. [Source: Fanatics Staff SWE Comp 2026]
