### Staff Software Engineer | Fanatics Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private $31B Valuation | Growth Equity | Sports Commerce Monopoly | Pre-IPO Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC | $185K-$240K | $140K-$340K | 10% | $270K-$430K |
| Jacksonville FL (HQ) | $175K-$228K | $130K-$320K | 10% | $255K-$408K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Fanatics define the technical strategy for major platform areas — commerce infrastructure, manufacturing integration, sports betting, or collectibles technology. At Staff level, pre-IPO equity becomes the dominant comp lever, and Fanatics has been willing to offer large equity packages to attract Staff-level talent from FAANG companies. Your architectural decisions shape the technology platform for a sports commerce monopoly during a critical pre-IPO period. [Source: Fanatics Staff SWE Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Fanatics Staff SWE = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Amazon Principal SDE = Shopify Staff SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Staff Equity:** "Staff-level equity in a $31B company with IPO trajectory. The grant should be $300K+ over 4 years to capture the IPO upside."
2. **Platform Architecture for IPO Readiness:** "My architectural decisions prepare Fanatics' technology platform for public company scale and scrutiny."
3. **Multi-Vertical Strategy:** "I influence technical direction across merchandise, betting, and collectibles — shaping a multi-billion-dollar sports platform."
4. **FAANG Alternative:** "My alternative is a Google L5 at $[X] with blue-chip equity. Fanatics' pre-IPO upside must compensate for private company risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "At Staff level, I'll define Fanatics' technical direction during the pre-IPO phase. I'm targeting $310K in equity over 4 years and a base of $235K. I have a Google L5 offer at $[X]." Accept at $260K+ equity with base above $222K.
