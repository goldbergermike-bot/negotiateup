**Negotiation DNA**

Fanatics Engineering Managers lead teams building the technology for a sports commerce monopoly during a critical pre-IPO period. You build engineering teams while establishing the technical culture and practices that will scale through IPO and beyond. Fanatics EMs manage across commerce, manufacturing integration, sports betting, and collectibles platforms. The pre-IPO equity at EM level is substantial. [Source: Fanatics EM Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Fanatics EM = Google EM L5 = Meta M1 = Amazon SDM II = Shopify EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Team Building:** "I'm building the engineering org that will carry Fanatics through IPO. This foundational leadership is uniquely valuable."
2. **Pre-IPO EM Equity:** "EM-level equity in a $31B company with IPO trajectory. The grant should be $245K+ over 4 years."
3. **Multi-Vertical Team Leadership:** "My teams span merchandise, betting, and collectibles — cross-vertical team management."
4. **FAANG EM Alternative:** "I have EM offers from [Google/Amazon] at $[X] with liquid equity. Fanatics' pre-IPO upside must compensate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Leading engineering at Fanatics during the pre-IPO phase is a defining opportunity. I'm targeting $250K in equity over 4 years and a base of $222K. I have a Google EM offer at $[X]." Accept at $210K+ equity with base above $212K.
