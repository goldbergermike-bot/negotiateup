### Software Engineer | Fanatics Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private $31B Valuation | Growth Equity | Sports Commerce Monopoly | Pre-IPO Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| NYC | $140K-$195K | $60K-$180K | 10% | $175K-$290K |
| Jacksonville FL (HQ) | $132K-$185K | $55K-$165K | 10% | $162K-$270K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Fanatics Software Engineers build the technology powering the world's largest licensed sports merchandise platform — serving fans of NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and more. Fanatics is a private company valued at $31B with a planned IPO trajectory, meaning equity grants carry pre-IPO upside that public companies cannot offer. The engineering challenges are unique to sports commerce: real-time demand spikes during games and championships, on-demand manufacturing integration, and a vertically integrated supply chain. Fanatics has expanded beyond merchandise into sports betting (Fanatics Sportsbook) and collectibles (Topps), creating a comprehensive sports platform. [Source: Fanatics SWE Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Fanatics Software Engineer = Google L3 = Meta E3 = Amazon SDE-I = Shopify SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Fanatics at $31B valuation has significant IPO upside. My equity grant should be sized to capture this growth trajectory."
2. **Sports Commerce Monopoly:** "Fanatics has exclusive licensing deals with every major sports league. I'm building technology for a monopoly platform."
3. **Real-Time Commerce Challenges:** "Sports events create massive demand spikes. Building systems that handle 100x traffic surges is a unique engineering challenge."
4. **Jacksonville Cost Advantage:** "If based in Jacksonville, my comp goes significantly further than NYC."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "Fanatics' sports commerce monopoly and pre-IPO trajectory are compelling. I'm targeting $160K in equity over 4 years and a base of $190K. I have a [Shopify/Amazon] offer at $[X]. The pre-IPO equity upside is attractive." Accept if equity exceeds $140K/4yr with a sign-on bonus.
