### Software Engineer | Fanatics Global Negotiation Guide

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|

**Negotiation DNA**

Fanatics Software Engineers build the technology powering the world's largest licensed sports merchandise platform — serving fans of NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and more. Fanatics is a private company valued at $31B with a planned IPO trajectory, meaning equity grants carry pre-IPO upside that public companies cannot offer. The engineering challenges are unique to sports commerce: real-time demand spikes during games and championships, on-demand manufacturing integration, and a vertically integrated supply chain. Fanatics has expanded beyond merchandise into sports betting (Fanatics Sportsbook) and collectibles (Topps), creating a comprehensive sports platform. [Source: Fanatics SWE Comp 2026]

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "Fanatics' sports commerce monopoly and pre-IPO trajectory are compelling. I'm targeting $160K in equity over 4 years and a base of $190K. I have a [Shopify/Amazon] offer at $[X]. The pre-IPO equity upside is attractive." Accept if equity exceeds $140K/4yr with a sign-on bonus.
