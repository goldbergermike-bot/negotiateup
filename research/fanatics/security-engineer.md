**Negotiation DNA**

Fanatics Security Engineers protect customer payment data, fan profiles, league partner data, and sports betting systems. Security at Fanatics spans e-commerce (payment processing, customer data), sports betting (regulated gambling systems, financial data), and collectibles (authentication, fraud prevention). The expansion into sports betting adds significant security and compliance requirements — regulated gambling requires financial-services-grade security and audit standards.
