| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Fanatics' signature engineering role. Sports Commerce Engineers build the platform that powers licensed sports merchandise for every major league — NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS, NASCAR, and college sports. Fanatics is a monopoly in licensed sports e-commerce: it manufactures, distributes, and sells licensed merchandise with exclusive deals with virtually every major sports league and team. The 5-15% sports platform premium reflects the specialized expertise in real-time commerce (demand spikes during games, championships, and trades), manufacturing integration, and the unique dynamics of sports-driven e-commerce. Fanatics' $31B private valuation and planned IPO trajectory mean growth equity carries significant pre-IPO upside. The company has expanded into sports betting (Fanatics Sportsbook) and collectibles (Fanatics Collect/Topps), creating a comprehensive sports commerce ecosystem.
