**Negotiation DNA**

Fanatics Product Designers shape the shopping experience for sports fans across merchandise, betting, and collectibles. Designing for sports commerce is emotionally charged — fans buy merchandise to celebrate wins, express team loyalty, and commemorate championships. The design must capture this emotional connection while handling the urgency of game-day demand. Your designs span the Fanatics app, team-specific storefronts, Fanatics Sportsbook, and the Topps/Fanatics Collect platform. [Source: Fanatics Product Design Comp 2026]
