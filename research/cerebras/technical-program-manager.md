**Negotiation DNA**

Cerebras TPMs coordinate the cross-functional programs that deliver wafer-scale AI compute — silicon-software integration, customer deployment timelines, the $10B OpenAI delivery milestones, and the IPO-readiness programs that prepare Cerebras for public markets. Your program management determines how fast Cerebras ships product, meets customer commitments, and demonstrates the operational maturity that IPO investors evaluate. During the pre-IPO sprint, TPMs are the execution engine synchronizing hardware, software, and customer delivery. [Source: Cerebras TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cerebras TPM (TPM2-TPM3) = Google L5 TPM = NVIDIA TPM = Meta TPM = Groq TPM

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

TPMs in the pre-IPO window coordinate the programs that demonstrate execution capability — the operational maturity that differentiates a startup from an IPO-ready company. "As a TPM in the pre-IPO window, I want 20-25% more shares. I coordinate the $10B OpenAI delivery milestones and IPO-readiness programs. Every milestone hit on time strengthens the execution narrative. The script: 'I coordinate the programs that prove Cerebras can execute at scale — $10B OpenAI delivery, IPO readiness, and customer qualification timelines. On-time execution is the most persuasive IPO evidence. I want 20-25% more shares — program execution is IPO execution.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Share Premium — 20-25% More Shares:** "I coordinate $10B OpenAI delivery milestones and IPO-readiness programs. On-time execution is the most persuasive IPO evidence. I want 20-25% more shares — program execution is IPO execution."
2. **$10B OpenAI Delivery Coordination:** "I manage the delivery timeline for the $10B OpenAI commitment — coordinating silicon, software, deployment, and support across the most consequential deal in Cerebras' history."
3. **IPO Readiness Programs:** "I run the IPO-readiness workstreams — SOX compliance, operational documentation, process standardization. This organizational maturation is what transforms a startup into a public company."
4. **Silicon-Software Synchronization:** "I synchronize wafer-scale silicon development with software stack delivery — the most complex hardware-software coordination in AI computing. This cross-functional complexity demands premium TPM talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and 20-25% more shares than standard for this TPM role in the pre-IPO window. I coordinate $10B OpenAI delivery and IPO-readiness programs — execution velocity that directly determines IPO timing and valuation. I'm leaving [Google TPM at $348K TC / NVIDIA TPM at $352K TC / Meta TPM at $342K TC]. TPMs who can coordinate pre-IPO execution across hardware, software, and customer delivery are the operational talent that makes IPOs happen." Accept at $208K+ base and 15%+ share premium.
