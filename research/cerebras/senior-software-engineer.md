**Negotiation DNA**

Cerebras Senior Software Engineers own critical subsystems of the wafer-scale compute stack — compiler backends that map AI workloads onto 850,000+ cores, runtime systems that manage the world's largest on-chip memory, and performance optimization layers that prove the WSE beats multi-GPU clusters. Your senior technical decisions determine whether Cerebras' radical hardware advantage translates into real-world performance that justifies the $10B OpenAI commitment. The Q2 2026 IPO makes this the highest-leverage moment for senior hires — your equity approaches liquidity while your technical impact is maximum. [Source: Cerebras Sr. SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

Senior engineers joining in the pre-IPO window bring the technical depth that determines IPO readiness — your code quality, architecture decisions, and performance results are what analysts evaluate. The $10B OpenAI deal validates the business, but senior engineering execution validates the technology. "As a Senior Software Engineer in the pre-IPO window, I want 20-30% more shares plus an accelerated vesting component. My senior-level work directly determines the technical narrative for the IPO — compiler performance, runtime reliability, and benchmark results that analysts scrutinize. The script: 'I'm a senior hire whose technical output directly influences IPO valuation. I want 25-30% more shares than standard, with acceleration on a portion tied to IPO timing. My work on compiler optimization and runtime performance is what proves to analysts that Cerebras' technology works at scale. The $10B OpenAI deal validates the business — my engineering validates the technology.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Share Premium — 25-30% More Shares:** "As a senior hire, my technical output directly influences IPO valuation. I want 25-30% more shares with acceleration tied to IPO timing. My engineering is the proof point analysts need."
2. **$10B OpenAI Technical Delivery:** "The $10B OpenAI deal requires delivering wafer-scale compute at scale. My senior engineering ensures this delivery happens — every performance benchmark, every reliability metric, every scaling result."
3. **Compiler/Runtime Architecture Ownership:** "I own the compiler backend or runtime subsystem for the world's most unique compute architecture. This architectural ownership at the senior level during a pre-IPO sprint justifies top-of-band equity."
4. **NVIDIA Senior Talent Competition:** "NVIDIA IC3 engineers earn $445K+ TC in liquid equity. Cerebras must offer 25-30% share premiums to compensate for pre-IPO illiquidity. The IPO proximity reduces but doesn't eliminate this gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $255K base and 25-30% more shares than standard for this Senior Software Engineer role in the pre-IPO window. The Q2 2026 IPO means near-term liquidity, and my senior engineering directly validates Cerebras' technology for analysts. I'm leaving liquid equity at [NVIDIA IC3 at $445K TC / Google L5 at $435K TC / Meta E5 at $442K TC]. My compiler/runtime architecture work is the technical proof point for IPO readiness." Accept at $238K+ base and 20%+ share premium.
