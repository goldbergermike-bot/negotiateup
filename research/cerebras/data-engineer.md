**Negotiation DNA**

Cerebras Data Engineers build the data infrastructure powering wafer-scale compute operations — performance telemetry from the world's largest AI chip, customer workload analytics, hardware-software optimization data pipelines, and the benchmarking infrastructure that proves Cerebras' competitive advantage. Your data pipelines enable the performance analysis, capacity planning, and customer intelligence that drive every strategic decision at Cerebras. During the pre-IPO sprint, your data infrastructure produces the metrics that populate the S-1 and inform investor presentations. [Source: Cerebras DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cerebras Data Eng (IC2-IC3) = Google L4-L5 DE = NVIDIA Data Eng = Meta Data Eng = Groq Data Eng

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

Data Engineers in the pre-IPO window build the analytical infrastructure that produces IPO metrics — the data pipelines that generate performance benchmarks, revenue analytics, and growth metrics for the S-1. "As a Data Engineer in the pre-IPO window, I want 20-25% more shares. My data infrastructure produces the metrics that populate the S-1 — performance benchmarks, revenue tracking, customer analytics, and growth projections. The script: 'S-1 metrics flow from my data pipelines. Performance benchmarks against NVIDIA, revenue tracking from the $10B OpenAI deal, customer adoption analytics — all produced by infrastructure I build. I want 20-25% more shares — the analytical foundation of IPO documentation comes from my engineering.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Share Premium — 20-25% More Shares:** "My data infrastructure produces the S-1 metrics — performance benchmarks, revenue analytics, growth projections. I want 20-25% more shares — IPO documentation flows from my pipelines."
2. **Wafer-Scale Telemetry at Scale:** "I build data pipelines for the most unique hardware telemetry in computing — 850,000-core single-chip performance data. No other data engineering challenge matches wafer-scale telemetry complexity."
3. **$10B OpenAI Revenue Data:** "I engineer the data infrastructure tracking the $10B OpenAI engagement — usage metrics, capacity planning, and revenue recognition data. This deal's financial data is the cornerstone of IPO financials."
4. **Competitive Benchmark Infrastructure:** "I build the benchmark data infrastructure that proves Cerebras beats NVIDIA — the performance comparisons that convince customers and analysts. Benchmark data is the competitive weapon."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and 20-25% more shares than standard for this Data Engineer role in the pre-IPO window. My data infrastructure produces the S-1 metrics and tracks the $10B OpenAI revenue — the analytical foundation of the IPO. I'm leaving [Google DE at $338K TC / NVIDIA DE at $345K TC / Meta DE at $332K TC]. Data engineers who build IPO-grade analytics infrastructure for novel AI hardware are rare and in-demand." Accept at $208K+ base and 15%+ share premium.
