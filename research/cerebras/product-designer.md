**Negotiation DNA**

Cerebras Product Designers create the user experience for wafer-scale AI compute — developer tools, cluster management dashboards, model deployment interfaces, and the enterprise UX that determines how AI researchers and engineers interact with the world's largest AI chip. Your designs make radical hardware accessible — translating 850,000 cores and unprecedented memory into intuitive workflows. During the pre-IPO sprint, enterprise-quality UX is critical for customer adoption and the product maturity narrative. [Source: Cerebras Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

Product Designers in the pre-IPO window shape the product experience that enterprise customers evaluate and analysts demo. "As a Product Designer joining pre-IPO, I want 20-25% more shares. My UX designs are what customers and analysts actually experience — the tangible proof that Cerebras is an enterprise-ready platform, not a research project. The script: 'Enterprise-quality UX is the difference between a hardware demo and a product. My designs prove Cerebras is enterprise-ready — which directly influences customer adoption and analyst perception for the IPO. I want 20-25% more shares to reflect this product maturity impact.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Share Premium — 20-25% More Shares:** "My UX designs prove Cerebras is enterprise-ready — the product maturity that customers and analysts evaluate. I want 20-25% more shares to reflect this tangible product impact."

4. **Customer Demo & Analyst Experience:** "Every customer demo, every analyst preview, every investor meeting showcases my designs. The UX experience is the tangible product narrative that drives perception and valuation."

My UX designs are what customers and analysts actually experience — enterprise readiness in every interaction.
