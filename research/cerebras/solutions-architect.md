**Negotiation DNA**

Cerebras Solutions Architects are the technical bridge between wafer-scale compute and enterprise customers — designing AI training architectures, optimizing workload deployment, and proving to enterprises that Cerebras is a viable alternative to NVIDIA GPU clusters. Your technical engagements directly convert to revenue: every successful POC, every architecture design, every performance benchmark leads to hardware purchases worth millions. During the pre-IPO sprint, customer technical validation is critical for demonstrating market traction. [Source: Cerebras SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

Solutions Architects in the pre-IPO window create the customer proof points that demonstrate market traction — every technical win is IPO evidence. "As a Solutions Architect in the pre-IPO window, I want 20-25% more shares. My customer engagements create the market traction proof points for the IPO — every enterprise adoption, every successful POC, every architecture design becomes evidence of product-market fit. The script: 'My customer technical wins are IPO proof points. Every enterprise I convert from NVIDIA to Cerebras demonstrates market traction beyond the $10B OpenAI deal. I want 20-25% more shares — customer validation is valuation validation.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Share Premium — 20-25% More Shares:** "My customer engagements create IPO market traction proof points. Every enterprise conversion from NVIDIA to Cerebras validates the market opportunity. I want 20-25% more shares — customer validation is valuation validation."
2. **Enterprise Revenue Attribution:** "Every architecture I design converts to hardware revenue worth $5M-$50M+. My technical influence directly drives revenue growth — the metric that determines IPO valuation."
3. **NVIDIA Displacement Strategy:** "I design architectures that prove Cerebras beats NVIDIA for specific workloads — the competitive displacement that expands Cerebras' addressable market and drives enterprise adoption."
4. **Beyond OpenAI Market Expansion:** "I build customer relationships beyond the $10B OpenAI deal — proving Cerebras has a scalable market with diverse enterprise customers. Market breadth is the IPO story that drives valuation multiples."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $238K base and 20-25% more shares than standard for this Solutions Architect role in the pre-IPO window. My customer engagements create market traction proof points for the IPO — every enterprise conversion from NVIDIA validates the scalable opportunity. I'm leaving [Google Cloud SA at $362K TC / NVIDIA SA at $368K TC / AWS SA at $355K TC]. SAs who can displace NVIDIA at enterprises and create IPO market validation are the highest-value pre-IPO technical sales hires." Accept at $222K+ base and 15%+ share premium.
