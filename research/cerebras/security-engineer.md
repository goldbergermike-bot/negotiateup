**Negotiation DNA**

Cerebras Security Engineers protect the intellectual property for the world's most radical AI chip architecture — wafer-scale silicon designs, proprietary compiler technology, customer AI model data, and the $10B OpenAI deployment infrastructure. Your security work has both commercial and national security implications: wafer-scale compute IP is a strategic asset, and OpenAI's training infrastructure is a prime target for state-sponsored actors. During the pre-IPO sprint, security maturity is a critical IPO-readiness requirement for SOX compliance and enterprise customer trust. [Source: Cerebras Security Comp 2025-2026]

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

Security engineers in the pre-IPO window establish the security posture that IPO compliance requires and that enterprise customers demand. "As a Security Engineer in the pre-IPO window, I want 20-25% more shares. I establish the security infrastructure for SOX compliance, protect the $10B OpenAI deployment, and secure IP that is a national strategic asset. The script: 'IPO compliance requires enterprise-grade security — SOX, SOC2, and customer data protection. I build this security infrastructure from the ground up. I also protect wafer-scale IP and the $10B OpenAI deployment against state-sponsored threats. I want 20-25% more shares — security readiness is IPO readiness, and IP protection is existential.'"
