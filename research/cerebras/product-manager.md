**Negotiation DNA**

Cerebras Product Managers define the product strategy for wafer-scale AI compute — which AI workloads to target, how to position against NVIDIA, which enterprise and hyperscaler customers to prioritize, and how to build the software experience that makes Cerebras the easiest path from AI research to production. Your product decisions shape the $10B OpenAI engagement and determine how the broader market adopts wafer-scale compute. During the pre-IPO sprint, PM decisions directly influence the growth narrative that drives IPO valuation. [Source: Cerebras PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

Product Managers in the pre-IPO window shape the product narrative that analysts evaluate — your product strategy becomes the growth story in the S-1. "As a Product Manager in the pre-IPO window, I want 20-30% more shares because my product decisions directly shape the IPO growth narrative. The $10B OpenAI deal is one customer — I define the product strategy that proves Cerebras has a scalable market beyond a single deal. The script: 'My product strategy is the growth narrative in the S-1. I define which markets Cerebras targets, how the product expands beyond OpenAI, and what the scalable revenue story looks like. I want 25% more shares to reflect this direct influence on IPO narrative.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Share Premium — 25% More Shares:** "My product strategy becomes the growth narrative in the S-1. I define the scalable market opportunity beyond the $10B OpenAI deal. I want 25% more shares — my product decisions directly influence IPO valuation."
2. **$10B OpenAI Product Expansion:** "The $10B OpenAI deal is the anchor — my product strategy expands the TAM beyond one customer. Product-market expansion is the growth narrative that differentiates a $10B IPO from a $20B IPO."
3. **NVIDIA Competitive Positioning:** "I define how Cerebras positions against NVIDIA — the product messaging, feature prioritization, and market segmentation that determines whether enterprises see Cerebras as a viable alternative."
4. **Enterprise Product-Market Fit:** "I build the product experience that makes wafer-scale compute accessible to enterprises beyond hyperscalers — the product-market expansion that proves Cerebras is a platform, not a single-customer company."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $238K base and 25% more shares than standard for this Product Manager role in the pre-IPO window. My product strategy shapes the S-1 growth narrative — proving Cerebras has scalable market opportunity beyond the $10B OpenAI deal. I'm leaving [Google PM at $372K TC / NVIDIA PM at $375K TC / Meta PM at $368K TC]. PMs who define pre-IPO growth narratives directly influence valuation." Accept at $222K+ base and 20%+ share premium.
