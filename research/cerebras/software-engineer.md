**Negotiation DNA**

Cerebras Software Engineers build the software stack for the world's largest AI chip — the Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE), a single chip the size of an entire silicon wafer that eliminates the memory and communication bottlenecks of multi-GPU clusters. Your software translates this radical hardware advantage into real-world AI training and inference performance. The $10B OpenAI deal validates Cerebras as a serious alternative to NVIDIA for the world's largest AI workloads, and the Q2 2026 IPO timeline means your equity is approaching a liquidity event.

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

Cerebras is targeting a Q2 2026 IPO — one of the most anticipated AI hardware IPOs in years. The $10B OpenAI deal provides revenue validation that dramatically de-risks the IPO. This is the last pre-IPO window to negotiate for shares at private-market valuations before public-market pricing. "As a Software Engineer joining in the pre-IPO window, I want 20-30% more shares than your standard offer. The Q2 2026 IPO is months away — my shares will have a public market within my first year. The $10B OpenAI deal proves Cerebras is a validated AI infrastructure company, not a speculative startup. My risk is dramatically lower than employees who joined 2-3 years ago, but my equity should still reflect the compression: I'm trading liquidity and big-tech stability for pre-IPO upside. The script: 'I'm joining months before the IPO. My risk window is short but my opportunity cost is real — I'm leaving [NVIDIA/Google/Meta] liquid equity. I want 20-30% more shares to compensate for the pre-IPO illiquidity premium, especially since the $10B OpenAI deal proves this isn't speculative anymore.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Share Premium — 20-30% More Shares:** "The Q2 2026 IPO is months away. I want 20-30% more shares than standard to compensate for pre-IPO illiquidity. The $10B OpenAI deal de-risks the investment — my shares will have a public market within my first year."
2. **$10B OpenAI Revenue Validation:** "The $10B OpenAI deal proves Cerebras is a validated AI infrastructure company. This revenue commitment means the IPO has strong fundamentals — my equity is backed by real revenue, not projections."
3. **Wafer-Scale Software Scarcity:** "Building software for wafer-scale compute is unlike any other engineering challenge. The talent pool who understands how to program a chip the size of a dinner plate is measured in hundreds, not thousands."
4. **NVIDIA Alternative Narrative:** "Cerebras is the leading alternative to NVIDIA for large-scale AI training. Every engineer who joins strengthens the competitive narrative that drives IPO valuation. My contribution to the IPO story has direct equity value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base and 20-30% more shares than the standard offer for this Software Engineer role in Cerebras' pre-IPO window. The Q2 2026 IPO means my shares reach liquidity within my first year, and the $10B OpenAI deal validates Cerebras as real AI infrastructure. I'm leaving liquid equity at [NVIDIA at $348K TC / Google at $335K TC / Meta at $342K TC] to join pre-IPO — the share premium compensates this liquidity sacrifice. Wafer-scale software engineering is the scarcest talent in AI hardware." Accept at $198K+ base and 15%+ share premium over standard offer.
