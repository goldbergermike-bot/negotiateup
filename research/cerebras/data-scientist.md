**Level Mapping:** Cerebras Data Scientist (IC2-IC3) = Google L4-L5 DS = NVIDIA DS = Meta DS = Groq DS

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

Data Scientists in the pre-IPO window build the analytical foundation for the IPO narrative — the performance benchmarks, growth metrics, and competitive analysis that appear in the S-1 and analyst presentations. "As a Data Scientist in the pre-IPO window, I want 20-25% more shares. My analysis produces the metrics and benchmarks that define the IPO narrative — performance vs. NVIDIA, customer adoption curves, and revenue projections. The script: 'The S-1 metrics come from my analysis. Performance benchmarks, growth projections, and competitive positioning data all flow from my work. I want 20-25% more shares — the analytical foundation of the IPO narrative deserves pre-IPO equity premium.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Share Premium — 20-25% More Shares:** "My analysis produces the S-1 metrics — performance benchmarks, growth projections, competitive positioning. The analytical foundation of the IPO narrative deserves 20-25% share premium."
2. **Wafer-Scale Performance Benchmarking:** "I benchmark wafer-scale compute against NVIDIA GPU clusters — the competitive analysis that proves Cerebras' hardware advantage. These benchmarks directly influence the $10B OpenAI deal and enterprise adoption."
3. **IPO Growth Narrative Analytics:** "I build the analytical models that project Cerebras' market growth — TAM analysis, customer adoption curves, and revenue forecasting. These models become the growth story in the S-1."
4. **Customer Workload Intelligence:** "I analyze which AI workloads benefit most from wafer-scale compute — targeting the use cases where Cerebras beats NVIDIA by the largest margin. This workload intelligence drives GTM strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $235K base and 20-25% more shares than standard for this Data Scientist role in the pre-IPO window. My analysis produces the benchmarks and growth metrics that define the S-1 narrative. I'm leaving [Google DS at $348K TC / NVIDIA DS at $355K TC / Meta DS at $342K TC]. Data scientists who can benchmark novel AI hardware and build IPO growth models are rare analytical talent." Accept at $218K+ base and 15%+ share premium.
