| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Sunnyvale | $178K–$225K | $158K–$278K | 10–15% | $228K–$318K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Cerebras DevOps Engineers build the CI/CD infrastructure, testing pipelines, and deployment automation for wafer-scale compute systems — hardware-software integration testing across the world's largest AI chip, cloud deployment orchestration for Cerebras' inference-as-a-service, and the operational infrastructure that ensures enterprise-grade reliability for the $10B OpenAI deployment. Your DevOps work is the operational backbone that transforms a hardware breakthrough into a reliable production platform. [Source: Cerebras DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cerebras DevOps (IC2-IC3) = Google L4 SRE = NVIDIA DevOps = Meta Production Eng = Groq DevOps

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

DevOps engineers in the pre-IPO window build the operational infrastructure that proves enterprise readiness — the reliability, deployment automation, and monitoring that customers and analysts evaluate. "As a DevOps Engineer in the pre-IPO window, I want 20-25% more shares. My infrastructure determines whether Cerebras can deliver enterprise-grade reliability for the $10B OpenAI deployment — and operational readiness is what differentiates a startup from an IPO-ready company. The script: 'Enterprise reliability comes from my infrastructure. The $10B OpenAI deal requires production-grade deployment — my CI/CD, monitoring, and automation make that possible. I want 20-25% more shares — operational readiness is IPO readiness.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Share Premium — 20-25% More Shares:** "My infrastructure determines enterprise operational readiness. The $10B OpenAI deal requires production-grade reliability. I want 20-25% more shares — operational readiness is IPO readiness."
2. **$10B OpenAI Deployment Infrastructure:** "I build the deployment and monitoring infrastructure for the $10B OpenAI engagement — the operational backbone that ensures Cerebras delivers at scale. Deal execution depends on my infrastructure."
3. **Wafer-Scale Testing Complexity:** "CI/CD for wafer-scale compute is unlike any other DevOps challenge — testing across 850,000 cores, validating hardware-software integration, and automating deployment of the world's largest AI chips."
4. **Cloud Inference Service Operations:** "I operate Cerebras' inference-as-a-service platform — the cloud offering that scales Cerebras beyond hardware sales. This cloud ops expertise drives the recurring revenue narrative for IPO."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $222K base and 20-25% more shares than standard for this DevOps Engineer role in the pre-IPO window. My infrastructure ensures enterprise-grade reliability for the $10B OpenAI deployment — operational readiness is IPO readiness. I'm leaving [Google SRE at $332K TC / NVIDIA DevOps at $338K TC / Meta Prod Eng at $328K TC]. DevOps engineers who can operate wafer-scale compute at production scale are rare operational talent." Accept at $205K+ base and 15%+ share premium.
