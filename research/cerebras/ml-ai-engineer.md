**Negotiation DNA**

Cerebras ML/AI Engineers build the machine learning systems that prove wafer-scale compute is the future of AI — ML-optimized compiler passes, AI model performance tuning, automated workload optimization, and the benchmark systems that demonstrate Cerebras beats NVIDIA GPU clusters for large-scale AI training and inference. Your ML work is the competitive weapon: every performance benchmark, every model optimization, every training speed record proves the WSE's advantage and justifies the $10B OpenAI commitment. The 15-25% AI Premium reflects the dual scarcity of ML expertise combined with wafer-scale compute knowledge. [Source: Cerebras ML Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Cerebras ML/AI Eng (IC3-IC4) = Google L5-L6 ML = NVIDIA ML Eng = Meta ML Eng = Groq ML Eng

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

ML/AI Engineers in the pre-IPO window produce the performance results that define Cerebras' competitive narrative — the training speed benchmarks, inference efficiency comparisons, and model optimization results that analysts use to evaluate the technology. "As an ML/AI Engineer with the AI Premium in the pre-IPO window, I want 25-30% more shares. My performance benchmarks are the technical proof points for IPO valuation — every training speed record, every efficiency comparison against NVIDIA, every model optimization result. The script: 'My ML work produces the benchmarks that prove Cerebras' technology to analysts and investors. Training speed records, inference efficiency, and model optimization are the technical evidence in the S-1. I want 25-30% more shares with the AI Premium — my dual value as ML talent producing IPO-critical benchmarks deserves maximum pre-IPO equity.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Share Premium + AI Premium — 25-30% More Shares:** "My benchmarks are the technical proof points for IPO valuation. With the 15-25% AI Premium, I want 25-30% more shares — dual-premium ML talent producing IPO-critical performance evidence."
2. **Wafer-Scale ML Performance:** "I optimize AI models for 850,000-core wafer-scale compute — the most unique ML optimization challenge in the industry. My performance results directly determine whether Cerebras wins against NVIDIA."
3. **$10B OpenAI Model Optimization:** "I optimize the AI models that OpenAI runs on Cerebras hardware — the performance tuning that ensures the $10B deal delivers value. Every percentage of optimization I deliver translates to OpenAI satisfaction and retention."
4. **Benchmark Record Strategy:** "I produce the training speed records and benchmark results that drive media coverage, customer interest, and analyst sentiment. My ML work is Cerebras' most powerful marketing weapon."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $268K base and 25-30% more shares than standard with the 15-25% AI Premium for this ML/AI Engineer role in the pre-IPO window. My benchmarks are the technical proof points for IPO valuation — training speed records and model optimization that prove Cerebras beats NVIDIA. I'm leaving [Google ML at $455K TC / NVIDIA ML at $462K TC / Meta ML at $448K TC]. AI Premium ML engineers who can benchmark novel hardware and produce IPO-critical performance evidence are the highest-leverage pre-IPO hires." Accept at $248K+ base and 20%+ share premium.
