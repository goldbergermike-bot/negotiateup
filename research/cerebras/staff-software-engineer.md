**Negotiation DNA**

Cerebras Staff Software Engineers define the software architecture for wafer-scale compute — the system-level design decisions for compilers, runtimes, distributed execution, and AI framework integration that determine whether the WSE's radical hardware advantage becomes a real-world competitive weapon. At the Staff level during the pre-IPO sprint, you're the technical leader whose architectural decisions shape both product capability and IPO narrative. The $10B OpenAI deal means your architecture must scale to support the world's most demanding AI workloads. [Source: Cerebras Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

Staff engineers in the pre-IPO window are the most consequential hires — your architectural decisions become the technical foundation that IPO analysts evaluate and that post-IPO engineers build on for years. "As a Staff Software Engineer in the pre-IPO window, I want 30% more shares with IPO acceleration and a leadership equity component. My architecture defines whether Cerebras' technology scales for the $10B OpenAI commitment — the single most important technical proof point for IPO valuation. The script: 'I'm a Staff-level architect joining months before IPO. My architectural decisions determine whether Cerebras can deliver on the $10B OpenAI deal — the cornerstone of your IPO narrative. I want 30% more shares than standard Staff offers, with acceleration tied to IPO timing. My risk is concentrated but my impact is existential — the right architecture scales to OpenAI, the wrong one doesn't. That existential impact deserves existential equity.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Share Premium — 30% More Shares:** "Staff architects define the technical foundation for IPO readiness. I want 30% more shares with IPO acceleration — my architectural decisions are the most consequential technical proof points for valuation."
2. **$10B OpenAI Architecture Scalability:** "The $10B OpenAI deal requires architecture that scales wafer-scale compute to the world's largest AI workloads. My Staff-level architecture determines whether Cerebras can deliver. This existential impact justifies existential equity."
3. **Wafer-Scale Architecture Definition:** "I define the software paradigm for the most radical compute architecture in the industry — 850,000+ cores on a single chip. No other company has this challenge. Staff architects who can design for wafer-scale compute are measured in dozens worldwide."
4. **FAANG Staff Equity Parity:** "Google L6 and Meta E6 Staff engineers earn $600K+ TC in liquid equity. Cerebras' pre-IPO Staff offers must include 30%+ share premiums to compensate for illiquidity — with the IPO proximity making this a time-limited ask."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $308K base and 30% more shares than standard Staff offer for this Staff Software Engineer role in the pre-IPO window. My architecture determines whether Cerebras scales for the $10B OpenAI deal — the IPO's cornerstone proof point. I'm leaving liquid equity at [Google L6 at $605K TC / NVIDIA IC4 at $608K TC / Meta E6 at $598K TC]. Staff architects who can design wafer-scale systems are measured in dozens. The 30% share premium with IPO acceleration reflects my existential technical impact." Accept at $285K+ base and 25%+ share premium.
