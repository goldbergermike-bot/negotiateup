**Negotiation DNA**

Cerebras Engineering Managers lead the teams building the software stack for wafer-scale compute — managing 8-15 engineers across compiler, runtime, framework integration, and performance optimization teams. Your hiring decisions, team execution, and delivery cadence directly determine whether Cerebras meets the $10B OpenAI delivery milestones that underpin IPO valuation. During the pre-IPO sprint, EMs are simultaneously scaling teams, shipping product, and preparing for the operational rigor that public-company engineering demands.

**Level Mapping:** Cerebras EM (M1) = Google L6 EM = NVIDIA EM = Meta M1 = Groq EM

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

Engineering Managers in the pre-IPO window build the teams that execute the technical roadmap — your hiring speed and team effectiveness determine whether Cerebras is IPO-ready. "As an Engineering Manager in the pre-IPO window, I want 25-30% more shares and a team-scaling bonus. I'm building the engineering organization that delivers on the $10B OpenAI commitment and demonstrates operational readiness for public markets. The script: 'I build the team that delivers. Every engineer I hire, every process I establish, every milestone my team hits is an IPO readiness proof point. I want 25-30% more shares than standard EM offers plus a team-scaling bonus for hitting headcount targets. The $10B OpenAI deal requires engineering scale-up — my management is the execution engine.'"
