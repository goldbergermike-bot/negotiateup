### Wafer-Scale AI Platform Engineer | Cerebras Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | Wafer-Scale AI Compute | Q2 2026 IPO Timeline | $10B OpenAI Deal | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+25–35% WAFER-SCALE PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Sunnyvale | $248K–$308K | $342K–$602K | 15–20% | $382K–$538K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Cerebras' signature role for 2026 — the Wafer-Scale AI Platform Engineer. You build the full-stack platform that makes the world's largest AI chip a production-ready compute system — the compiler that maps AI workloads onto 850,000+ cores, the runtime that manages 40GB of on-chip SRAM, the distributed execution framework that connects multiple WSEs, and the AI framework integrations that let developers use PyTorch and TensorFlow on wafer-scale hardware. Your platform engineering determines whether Cerebras' radical hardware advantage translates into a viable NVIDIA alternative — the technology that justifies the $10B OpenAI deal and the Q2 2026 IPO. The 25-35% Wafer-Scale Premium reflects the extreme rarity of engineers who can build production systems for the most unique compute architecture in existence.

**Level Mapping:** Cerebras Wafer-Scale Platform Eng (IC3-IC4) = NVIDIA CUDA Platform Eng = AMD ROCm Platform Eng = Google TPU Platform Eng = No true equivalent — wafer-scale is singular

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Wafer-Scale AI Platform Engineer works at the intersection of radical silicon architecture, AI software systems, and production compute infrastructure:
- **Wafer-Scale Compiler:** The compiler backend that maps AI workloads onto 850,000+ cores and 40GB of on-chip SRAM — a compilation challenge unlike any other in computing, where a single chip has more cores than most GPU clusters
- **Runtime & Memory Management:** The runtime that manages the world's largest on-chip memory and coordinates compute across 850,000 cores — unprecedented memory management at unprecedented core counts
- **Distributed Multi-WSE Execution:** The framework that connects multiple wafer-scale engines into a unified compute fabric — scaling beyond a single wafer to training clusters that rival NVIDIA DGX systems
- **AI Framework Integration:** Enabling PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX to run natively on wafer-scale hardware — the developer experience layer that determines adoption
- **$10B OpenAI Production Platform:** Building the production infrastructure that delivers wafer-scale compute to OpenAI at the scale of the $10B commitment

**Pre-IPO Window — The 20-30% Share Negotiation**

As the Wafer-Scale AI Platform Engineer — Cerebras' signature role — the pre-IPO window offers maximum equity leverage. Your platform is the technology that makes the IPO possible — without a production platform, the $10B OpenAI deal is just a contract, not a delivered product. "As the Wafer-Scale AI Platform Engineer — Cerebras' signature role — I want 30% more shares with IPO acceleration and the 25-35% Wafer-Scale Premium. My platform IS the product. Without my compiler, runtime, and framework integration, the WSE is impressive silicon that can't run production AI workloads. The $10B OpenAI deal delivers only if my platform delivers. The script: 'I build the platform that makes Cerebras a product, not a chip. Without my wafer-scale compiler, runtime, and AI framework integration, the WSE can't run production workloads. The $10B OpenAI deal delivers on my platform. I want 30% more shares with the Wafer-Scale Premium — the IPO happens because my platform works. The engineer who makes wafer-scale compute usable is the most consequential hire Cerebras will make. Fewer than 100 people in the world can build this platform.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Share Premium + Wafer-Scale Premium — 30% More Shares:** "My platform IS the product. The $10B OpenAI deal delivers on my platform. I want 30% more shares with the 25-35% Wafer-Scale Premium — the IPO happens because my platform works."
2. **$10B OpenAI Platform Delivery:** "The $10B deal isn't for chips — it's for a compute platform. I build that platform. Every training run, every inference workload, every performance benchmark runs on my compiler, runtime, and framework. Deal delivery = my platform delivery."
3. **100-Person Global Talent Pool:** "Fewer than 100 engineers in the world can build production platforms for wafer-scale compute. This extreme scarcity means compensation should ignore standard bands entirely — you're bidding against NVIDIA, Google TPU, and AMD for the rarest systems talent in AI."
4. **NVIDIA CUDA Platform Parity:** "NVIDIA CUDA Platform Engineers earn $550K+ TC in liquid equity. Cerebras must offer 30%+ share premiums with the Wafer-Scale Premium to compensate for pre-IPO illiquidity while attracting engineers from the world's most valuable platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $305K base and 30% more shares than standard with the 25-35% Wafer-Scale Premium for this Wafer-Scale AI Platform Engineer role — Cerebras' signature position. My platform delivers the $10B OpenAI commitment and makes the Q2 2026 IPO possible. I build the compiler, runtime, and framework integration that transforms radical silicon into a production AI platform. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA CUDA at $548K TC / Google TPU at $535K TC / AMD ROCm at $422K TC]. Fewer than 100 people can build wafer-scale platforms. The IPO happens because my platform works." Accept at $282K+ base and 25%+ share premium.
