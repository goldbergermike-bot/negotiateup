### Work Graph Engineer — Asana Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: The Work Graph Engineer is Asana's most strategically critical hire — the specialist who builds and evolves the proprietary graph data model that is the foundation of Asana's entire product and the core of its $5B competitive moat.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | New York (USD) | Europe (EUR/GBP) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and 10% performance bonus. This role commands the highest compensation bands within Asana's engineering organization due to the combination of graph systems expertise and work management domain knowledge. Asana (NYSE: ASAN) RSUs vest over four years.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Asana

The Work Graph is Asana's single most important technical asset. It is the proprietary data model that maps the relationships between goals, portfolios, projects, tasks, subtasks, people, teams, and timelines — creating a rich graph structure that no competitor has replicated. Every product feature at Asana — from workload management to portfolio tracking to Asana Intelligence — is built on the Work Graph. The Work Graph Engineer is the person who designs, builds, and evolves this foundational system.

Asana was founded on the insight that work coordination is fundamentally a graph problem. Every task has dependencies, every project connects to goals, every person contributes across multiple teams, and every timeline interacts with others. The Work Graph captures these relationships in a data model that enables features impossible with traditional relational databases or simple task lists.

As a Work Graph Engineer, your work has multiplicative impact: every improvement to the graph data model, every new relationship type, every query optimization, and every scale improvement affects every product feature and every customer. This leverage is the foundation of your negotiation position.

The emergence of Asana Intelligence — the company's AI layer — makes the Work Graph even more strategically important. AI features built on rich graph data are fundamentally more powerful than AI built on flat data structures. The Work Graph gives Asana a structural advantage in applying AI to work management, and Work Graph Engineers are the people who make this advantage real.

#### Asana Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Asana Internal Level | Typical YoE | Focus Area |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| Work Graph Engineer | WGE (IC4) | 3–5 years | Feature-level Work Graph contributions |
| Senior Work Graph Engineer | Sr WGE (IC5) | 5–8 years | Subsystem ownership, graph model evolution |
| Staff Work Graph Engineer | Staff WGE (IC6) | 8–12 years | Cross-product graph architecture |
| Principal Work Graph Architect | Principal (IC7) | 12+ years | Platform-wide graph strategy and vision |

*Note: This role maps to premium compensation bands due to the combination of graph systems expertise and work management domain knowledge.*

### Asana Work Graph & AI Intelligence Premium

As the Work Graph Engineer, the graph data model is your entire negotiation thesis. You are building the technical foundation that every product, every AI feature, and every customer depends on. The Work Graph is what makes Asana different from every competitor, and you are the engineer who evolves it.

The Work Graph captures work relationships at a fidelity that no competitor matches: task dependencies, goal hierarchies, resource allocation across projects, cross-team dependencies, and temporal relationships. These relationships are the raw material for Asana Intelligence — every AI feature is more powerful because it operates on graph-structured data rather than flat tables.

Use this in every negotiation: "The Work Graph is Asana's most valuable technical asset — the foundation of every product feature and the structural advantage that powers Asana Intelligence. I am the engineer who builds and evolves this system. My compensation should reflect the foundational importance of the Work Graph to Asana's $5B valuation and competitive position."

#### Global Lever 1: Work Graph Platform

Core graph engineering: "I will design and build the Work Graph's core data model — defining new relationship types, optimizing query patterns, and scaling the graph to serve millions of teams. My experience with [graph databases / distributed systems / data modeling] is the exact skill set this role requires."

#### Global Lever 2: Asana Intelligence (AI)

AI-powered graph features: "I will design the graph structures that power Asana Intelligence — creating relationship models that enable AI to predict task completion, recommend resource allocation, and identify bottlenecks. The richness of the Work Graph determines the quality of AI features."

#### Global Lever 3: Enterprise & Scale

Enterprise graph scaling: "I will scale the Work Graph to support enterprise deployments — millions of nodes, billions of edges, with sub-second query performance. Enterprise customers need the Work Graph to represent their entire organizational structure and project portfolio."

#### Global Lever 4: Platform & Integrations Ecosystem

Graph API and platform: "I will design the APIs that expose the Work Graph to integrations and third-party applications — enabling an ecosystem of tools that extend Asana's reach through the Work Graph."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $200,000 base with $180,000 in RSUs over 4 years. Your accept-at floor should be $280,000 total comp. Cite the Work Graph's foundational importance to Asana's entire product and competitive position, your graph systems expertise, and the AI premium that Work Graph Engineers command. For New York, open at $195,000 base; for Europe, open at EUR 82,000 base. Push for larger RSU grants — the Work Graph is the foundation of Asana's long-term value.
