#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Asana

Asana occupies a unique position in the work management category: it was founded by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and early Facebook engineer Justin Rosenstein with the mission to help humanity thrive by enabling the world's teams to work together effortlessly. This mission-driven culture attracts engineers who care about building products that have a meaningful impact on how people work.

Asana's Work Graph data model — the proprietary graph that maps relationships between work items, people, goals, and portfolios — is the company's core technical differentiation. Software Engineers who can build on and extend the Work Graph are contributing to Asana's most valuable intellectual property.

The $5B market cap reflects Asana's established position in work management, but the company is investing heavily in AI-powered features (Asana Intelligence) to differentiate from competitors. Engineers who combine work management domain expertise with AI capabilities are well-positioned for premium compensation.

### Asana Work Graph & AI Intelligence Premium

Asana's Work Graph is the proprietary data model that differentiates the platform from every competitor. Unlike simple task lists, the Work Graph maps the relationships between goals, projects, tasks, people, and timelines — creating a rich graph structure that enables intelligent features like workload management, portfolio tracking, and now AI-powered insights.

Asana Intelligence — the company's AI layer built on top of the Work Graph — represents the next phase of product differentiation. AI features that leverage the Work Graph's relationship data to provide intelligent recommendations, automated workflows, and predictive project insights are the key to Asana's competitive positioning against Monday.com, Smartsheet, and Microsoft.

Use this framing: "Asana's Work Graph is the company's most valuable technical asset. My experience in [graph systems / data modeling / distributed systems] positions me to extend the Work Graph in ways that power Asana Intelligence and differentiate the platform. My compensation should reflect the strategic importance of the Work Graph to Asana's $5B valuation."

#### Global Lever 1: Work Graph Platform

The Work Graph is Asana's core technical moat: "I will build and extend the Work Graph — the data model that maps relationships between goals, projects, tasks, and people. My experience with [graph databases / relationship modeling / distributed systems] directly applies to Asana's most strategic technical asset."

#### Global Lever 2: Asana Intelligence (AI)

AI built on the Work Graph: "Asana Intelligence is the AI layer that transforms the Work Graph into actionable insights. My experience with [ML systems / NLP / recommendation engines] enables me to build intelligent features that leverage the Work Graph's unique relationship data."

#### Global Lever 3: Enterprise & Scale

Enterprise adoption drives revenue: "I will build the enterprise features — governance, security, compliance, and scalability — that enable Asana to compete for large enterprise contracts. My experience with [enterprise software / multi-tenant architecture / compliance engineering] accelerates this growth vector."

#### Global Lever 4: Platform & Integrations Ecosystem

Asana's integration ecosystem extends the Work Graph: "I will build the platform and integration layer that connects Asana to the tools teams already use — Slack, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, and hundreds of others. My experience with [API design / platform engineering / developer experience] enables me to grow the ecosystem that makes Asana indispensable."
