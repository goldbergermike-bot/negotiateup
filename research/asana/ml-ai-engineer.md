#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Asana

ML/AI Engineers at Asana have a unique advantage: the Work Graph provides graph-structured data about work relationships that no other company possesses. AI models built on this rich relational data are fundamentally more powerful than models trained on flat task lists. This data advantage is Asana's structural moat in the AI race among work management platforms.

Asana Intelligence — the company's AI product strategy — depends on ML/AI Engineers who can translate the Work Graph's relationship data into intelligent features: smart task assignment, project risk prediction, workload optimization, and automated workflow suggestions.
