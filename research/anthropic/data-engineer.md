### Data Engineer | Anthropic Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy ($300K+) + Pre-IPO Equity | AI Safety Pioneer | Safety Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $205K-$258K | $225K-$395K | — | $261K-$357K |
| Seattle | $199K-$245K | $225K-$395K | — | $255K-$344K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Anthropic build the data infrastructure that feeds Claude's training, fine-tuning, and safety evaluation pipelines. This is not traditional ETL or analytics engineering — you'll architect the systems that curate training datasets, manage RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) data flows, build evaluation dataset pipelines, and ensure data quality for Constitutional AI training processes. Every piece of data that shapes Claude's behavior passes through infrastructure you build and maintain. The role demands deep expertise in large-scale data systems combined with an understanding of how data quality directly impacts model safety and capability — making this one of the most consequential data engineering roles in the AI industry.

**The Safety Premium — $300K+ Base Benchmark**
Anthropic pays the highest base salaries in the AI industry — the "Safety Premium." This isn't charity; it's strategic. Anthropic attracts mission-driven talent who want to build AI safely, and the high base ensures they don't lose candidates to OpenAI's equity-heavy offers. Use Anthropic's base as your benchmark: "Anthropic is offering me $205K-$258K base for comparable work. Your base needs to match or the equity must compensate for the gap." While data engineering bases start below the $300K senior engineering threshold, Anthropic's range significantly exceeds typical data engineering compensation and the pre-IPO equity provides substantial upside. The Safety Premium also provides financial stability during the pre-IPO period — you're not dependent on a liquidity event to earn market-rate compensation. When comparing offers, Anthropic's data engineering base is the anchor for AI data infrastructure negotiations.

**Global Levers**
1. **RLHF Data Pipeline Expertise:** "Engineers who understand the data infrastructure requirements of RLHF, Constitutional AI training, and model evaluation datasets are rare. My experience building [human feedback pipelines / large-scale annotation systems / training data curation platforms] directly maps to Anthropic's most critical data needs. I'm looking for $255K base."
2. **Data Quality-Safety Linkage:** "The quality of Anthropic's training and evaluation data directly determines Claude's safety and capability. As the person building and maintaining these pipelines, I have a disproportionate impact on Anthropic's core product. I'd like $250K base and $385K equity/4yr to reflect that impact."
3. **Competing AI Data Infrastructure Offers:** "Databricks is offering me $235K base / $320K RSU for a senior data engineering role. Google is at $230K base / $300K RSU. Anthropic's RLHF and Constitutional AI data challenges are uniquely interesting, but I need $252K base and $380K equity/4yr to make the pre-IPO risk work."
4. **Scale and Complexity Premium:** "Anthropic's data pipelines operate at a scale and complexity that few companies can match — petabytes of training data, real-time RLHF feedback loops, multi-modal evaluation datasets. The infrastructure demands are closer to a hyperscaler than a typical AI startup. A $40K signing bonus would reflect the operational complexity of this role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building the data infrastructure that makes Claude safer and more capable — this is the most impactful data engineering work in AI right now. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $235K base / $320K RSU and a Google offer at $230K base / $300K RSU. For Anthropic, I need $252K base, $380K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. The $252K base is my target — it reflects the RLHF and Constitutional AI data expertise this role demands. My floor is $235K base; below that, the Databricks liquid equity and data platform scale are too compelling. I want to build the data foundations for AI safety — let's finalize the right package."
