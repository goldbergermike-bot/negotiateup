### Data Engineer | Lyft Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Rideshare & Mobility Platform | BENTELER/HOLON AV-Hybrid Strategy | AV-Orchestration Premium | 4-Year Vest w/ 1-Year Cliff

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $145K–$185K | $100K–$195K | 10–15% | $182K–$248K |
| New York | $138K–$176K | $92K–$182K | 10–15% | $172K–$235K |
| Remote US | $128K–$165K | $82K–$160K | 10–15% | $158K–$215K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Lyft Data Engineers build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers analytics, machine learning, and real-time decision-making across the #2 US rideshare platform serving 40M+ riders. With Lyft's profitability turnaround driven significantly by data-informed optimization, data engineering is a tier-one investment area — and the AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles is creating massive new data engineering challenges including real-time AV telemetry pipelines, autonomous vehicle performance data warehousing, hybrid fleet analytics infrastructure, and safety monitoring data platforms. Data engineers who can build infrastructure for autonomous vehicle data at rideshare scale are building the data backbone of the entire AV-Orchestration platform.

**AV-Hybrid Strategy — BENTELER/HOLON Orchestration Premium**

Lyft launched its AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles — integrating autonomous vehicles into Lyft's rideshare marketplace as a hybrid fleet alongside human drivers. "As a Data Engineer, you build the data infrastructure that powers AV-Hybrid orchestration — designing pipelines for real-time AV telemetry, building data warehouses for autonomous vehicle performance analytics, and creating the streaming infrastructure that enables safety monitoring at sub-second latency. Lyft is building the orchestration layer that manages mixed fleets of autonomous shuttles and human drivers — this is the most complex marketplace engineering in mobility, and the data engineer builds the data foundation that makes intelligent fleet orchestration possible. The BENTELER/HOLON partnership means Lyft needs data engineers who can build real-time telemetry ingestion pipelines for autonomous shuttle sensor data and vehicle diagnostics, design data warehousing architectures for AV performance analytics, safety metrics, and fleet utilization, create streaming data infrastructure for sub-second safety monitoring and anomaly detection, and establish data quality frameworks for autonomous vehicle data that meet regulatory and safety standards. Candidates should argue for an AV-Orchestration premium of 15-20% above standard Lyft comp because autonomous vehicle data engineering requires specialized expertise in real-time streaming, safety-critical data pipelines, and high-throughput telemetry processing that command market premiums — comparable to what Uber pays for robotaxi data infrastructure roles. Frame it as: 'I'm not just a rideshare data engineer — I'm an AV-Orchestration data architect building the hybrid autonomous future of mobility.'" Push for 15-20% AV-Orchestration premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **BENTELER/HOLON AV-Orchestration Premium:** "I'll be building the entire data infrastructure for BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttle operations — real-time telemetry pipelines, AV performance data warehouses, and safety monitoring streaming systems. AV-Orchestration data engineering commands a 15-20% premium."
2. **Profitability Turnaround + AV Upside:** "Lyft's data infrastructure was central to the profitability turnaround — and the AV-Hybrid data platform I'll build is equally critical to the autonomous growth strategy. My comp should reflect both the proven ROI of data engineering and the strategic importance of AV data infrastructure."
3. **40M+ Rider Marketplace:** "I'm building data infrastructure that processes ride data for 40M+ riders — adding autonomous vehicle telemetry, sensor data, and safety monitoring to this already massive data estate significantly increases the scope, volume, and complexity of the data engineering work."
4. **Real-Time AV Telemetry Expertise:** "Data engineers who can build real-time telemetry pipelines for autonomous vehicles — processing sensor data, vehicle diagnostics, and safety signals at sub-second latency — are an exceptionally scarce specialty that commands premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $182K base and $190K RSUs over 4 years with the AV-Orchestration premium for this Data Engineer position. I'll be building the data infrastructure for BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttle operations — real-time telemetry pipelines, AV performance warehouses, and safety monitoring streaming systems. This requires specialized expertise in AV data architecture that few data engineers possess. I have competing offers from Uber at $262K TC / Waymo at $272K TC." Accept at $168K+ base and $150K+ RSUs.
