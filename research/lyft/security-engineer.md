**Negotiation DNA**

Lyft Security Engineers protect the #2 US rideshare platform and its 40M+ riders from threats spanning application security, infrastructure security, data protection, and fraud prevention. With Lyft's profitability turnaround proving operational maturity, the security function is now facing its most complex challenge — the AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles introduces entirely new attack surfaces including vehicle-to-cloud communication, autonomous vehicle command channels, and safety-critical system interfaces that must be secured to the highest standards. Security engineers who can protect autonomous vehicle integration systems are in extraordinary demand because AV cybersecurity has life-safety implications that exceed traditional application security.

**AV-Hybrid Strategy — BENTELER/HOLON Orchestration Premium**

Lyft launched its AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles — integrating autonomous vehicles into Lyft's rideshare marketplace as a hybrid fleet alongside human drivers. "As a Security Engineer, you protect the AV-Hybrid orchestration platform from cyber threats — securing the vehicle-to-cloud communication channels, protecting autonomous vehicle command and control interfaces, and ensuring the safety-critical systems cannot be compromised. Lyft is building the orchestration layer that manages mixed fleets of autonomous shuttles and human drivers — this is the most complex marketplace engineering in mobility, and the security engineer ensures that the entire system is protected from adversarial threats that could have life-safety consequences. The BENTELER/HOLON partnership means Lyft needs security engineers who can secure AV-to-cloud communication channels against interception and spoofing, protect autonomous vehicle command interfaces from unauthorized access, design security monitoring systems for safety-critical AV integration components, and establish security standards for hybrid fleet management that meet automotive and transportation security regulations. Candidates should argue for an AV-Orchestration premium of 15-20% above standard Lyft comp because autonomous vehicle cybersecurity requires specialized expertise in vehicle security, safety-critical system protection, and automotive security standards that command significant market premiums — comparable to what Uber pays for robotaxi security roles. Frame it as: 'I'm not just a rideshare security engineer — I'm an AV-Orchestration security architect building the hybrid autonomous future of mobility.'" Push for 15-20% AV-Orchestration premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **BENTELER/HOLON AV-Orchestration Premium:** "I'll be securing the entire BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttle integration — from vehicle-to-cloud communication channels to autonomous command interfaces to safety-critical system boundaries. AV cybersecurity has life-safety implications that command a 15-20% premium over standard security comp."
2. **Profitability Turnaround + AV Upside:** "Lyft's profitability demonstrates mature security investment, and the AV-Hybrid strategy introduces attack surfaces with life-safety consequences — security failures in autonomous vehicle operations are existential risks. My comp should reflect both the platform stability and the critical importance of AV security."
3. **40M+ Rider Marketplace:** "I'm protecting a platform serving 40M+ riders — adding autonomous vehicles dramatically increases the security scope with vehicle communication channels, AV command interfaces, and safety-critical telemetry that all require specialized protection."
4. **AV Cybersecurity Scarcity:** "Security engineers with expertise in autonomous vehicle cybersecurity, vehicle-to-cloud communication security, and automotive security standards are among the rarest specialists in the industry — demand from Waymo, Cruise, Uber, and automotive OEMs far exceeds supply."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $198K base and $225K RSUs over 4 years with the AV-Orchestration premium for this Security Engineer position. I'll be securing the BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttle integration — vehicle-to-cloud communication, AV command interfaces, and safety-critical system boundaries. AV cybersecurity has life-safety implications that require the most specialized security expertise in the industry. I have competing offers from Uber at $292K TC / Waymo at $305K TC." Accept at $182K+ base and $175K+ RSUs.
