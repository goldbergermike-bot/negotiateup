**Negotiation DNA**

Lyft Data Scientists drive decision-making across the #2 US rideshare platform, building models and analyses that optimize pricing, matching, rider retention, and marketplace dynamics for 40M+ riders. With Lyft's profitability turnaround demonstrating disciplined analytical rigor, the data science function is now pivoting toward the AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles — creating new modeling challenges around autonomous fleet utilization, hybrid dispatch optimization, AV safety monitoring, and rider behavior analysis for mixed-mode transportation. Data scientists who can model the economics and performance of hybrid autonomous-human fleets are in critical demand as Lyft builds the data infrastructure for AV-Orchestration.

**AV-Hybrid Strategy — BENTELER/HOLON Orchestration Premium**

Lyft launched its AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles — integrating autonomous vehicles into Lyft's rideshare marketplace as a hybrid fleet alongside human drivers. "As a Data Scientist, you build the analytical models that optimize the AV-Hybrid marketplace — determining the right mix of autonomous shuttles and human drivers, modeling AV fleet utilization, analyzing rider behavior in autonomous rides, and quantifying the safety and economic performance of the hybrid fleet. Lyft is building the orchestration layer that manages mixed fleets of autonomous shuttles and human drivers — this is the most complex marketplace engineering in mobility, and the data scientist provides the analytical foundation that enables optimal fleet orchestration. The BENTELER/HOLON partnership means Lyft needs data scientists who can model AV integration economics and fleet utilization optimization, build safety monitoring analytics for autonomous ride performance, design experimentation frameworks for hybrid dispatch algorithms, and analyze rider adoption patterns and trust signals for autonomous rides. Candidates should argue for an AV-Orchestration premium of 15-20% above standard Lyft comp because autonomous fleet analytics requires specialized expertise in safety-critical modeling, AV performance measurement, and hybrid marketplace optimization that command market premiums — comparable to what Uber pays for robotaxi data science roles. Frame it as: 'I'm not just a rideshare data scientist — I'm an AV-Orchestration analyst building the hybrid autonomous future of mobility.'" Push for 15-20% AV-Orchestration premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **BENTELER/HOLON AV-Orchestration Premium:** "I'll be building the analytical models that optimize BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttle fleet utilization, safety monitoring, and hybrid dispatch — this AV-Orchestration analytics scope requires specialized modeling expertise that commands a 15-20% premium."
2. **Profitability Turnaround + AV Upside:** "Lyft's profitability was driven by data-informed decision-making — my analytical work on AV fleet optimization will be equally critical to the next growth phase. My comp should reflect both the proven value of data science at Lyft and the strategic importance of AV analytics."
3. **40M+ Rider Marketplace:** "I'm building models that optimize a marketplace serving 40M+ riders — adding autonomous vehicles to this marketplace creates unprecedented analytical complexity in fleet balancing, pricing, and demand prediction."
4. **AV Safety Analytics Scarcity:** "Data scientists with experience in autonomous vehicle safety monitoring and performance analytics are extremely rare — this skill is essential for Lyft's BENTELER/HOLON integration and commands a significant market premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $188K base and $210K RSUs over 4 years with the AV-Orchestration premium for this Data Scientist position. I'll be building the analytical models that optimize BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttle fleet utilization, safety monitoring, and hybrid dispatch — this requires specialized expertise in AV performance modeling and safety-critical analytics. I have competing offers from Uber at $278K TC / Waymo at $290K TC." Accept at $175K+ base and $165K+ RSUs.
