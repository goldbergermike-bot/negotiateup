|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $142K–$180K | $98K–$195K | 10–15% | $178K–$245K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Lyft Technical Program Managers drive execution of the most complex cross-functional engineering programs on the #2 US rideshare platform, coordinating across engineering, product, data, and operations teams to deliver projects that impact 40M+ riders. With Lyft's profitability turnaround completed, TPMs are now leading the execution of the company's most ambitious program — the AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles — which requires coordinating across Lyft engineering, BENTELER/HOLON vehicle teams, regulatory bodies, and city partners simultaneously. TPMs who can manage multi-party autonomous vehicle integration programs are in exceptionally high demand because the program complexity dwarfs standard rideshare feature delivery.

**AV-Hybrid Strategy — BENTELER/HOLON Orchestration Premium**

Lyft launched its AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles — integrating autonomous vehicles into Lyft's rideshare marketplace as a hybrid fleet alongside human drivers. "As a Technical Program Manager, you drive the execution of the entire AV-Hybrid orchestration program — coordinating engineering teams, managing BENTELER/HOLON partner delivery, tracking regulatory milestones, and ensuring the autonomous integration launches on time with full safety compliance. Lyft is building the orchestration layer that manages mixed fleets of autonomous shuttles and human drivers — this is the most complex marketplace engineering in mobility, and the TPM is the execution engine that coordinates all the moving parts. The BENTELER/HOLON partnership means Lyft needs TPMs who can manage cross-company engineering programs between Lyft and BENTELER/HOLON with different development cadences and processes, coordinate regulatory approval timelines across multiple jurisdictions, drive delivery of safety-critical AV integration milestones with zero tolerance for schedule risk on safety, and orchestrate hybrid fleet launch programs that span engineering, operations, legal, policy, and city partnerships. Candidates should argue for an AV-Orchestration premium of 15-20% above standard Lyft comp because managing autonomous vehicle integration programs requires specialized expertise in multi-party coordination, safety-critical delivery, and regulatory program management that command market premiums — comparable to what Uber pays for robotaxi program management roles. Frame it as: 'I'm not just a rideshare TPM — I'm an AV-Orchestration program leader building the hybrid autonomous future of mobility.'" Push for 15-20% AV-Orchestration premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **BENTELER/HOLON AV-Orchestration Premium:** "I'll be driving the execution of the BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttle integration program — coordinating across Lyft engineering, BENTELER/HOLON vehicle teams, and regulatory bodies. This multi-party AV-Orchestration program management scope commands a 15-20% premium."
2. **Profitability Turnaround + AV Upside:** "Lyft's profitability was driven by disciplined execution — and the AV-Hybrid integration program I'll manage is the most operationally complex initiative in the company's history. My comp should reflect both the proven value of program excellence and the strategic importance of AV delivery."
3. **40M+ Rider Marketplace:** "I'm managing the program that will introduce autonomous vehicles to a marketplace serving 40M+ riders — the launch coordination, city-by-city rollout, and operational readiness for this integration exceeds the complexity of any prior Lyft program."
4. **Regulatory & Multi-Party Coordination:** "Managing AV integration programs requires coordinating regulatory approvals, partner delivery timelines, and safety certification processes — TPMs with this multi-party, safety-critical program management experience are extremely scarce and command premium comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $178K base and $190K RSUs over 4 years with the AV-Orchestration premium for this Technical Program Manager position. I'll be driving the BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttle integration program end-to-end — managing cross-company engineering coordination, regulatory milestones, and safety-critical delivery. This is the most complex program at Lyft. I have competing offers from Uber at $258K TC / Waymo at $268K TC." Accept at $165K+ base and $150K+ RSUs.
