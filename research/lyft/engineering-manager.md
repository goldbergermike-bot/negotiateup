**Negotiation DNA**

Lyft Engineering Managers lead the teams building and scaling the #2 US rideshare platform for 40M+ riders, owning team performance, technical direction, and delivery across critical product areas. As Lyft completes its profitability turnaround, engineering leadership is pivoting from cost-cutting to strategic investment — and the AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles represents the single largest new engineering initiative at the company. EMs who can build and lead AV-integration teams are in uniquely high demand because they must recruit specialized talent, set technical strategy for safety-critical systems, and coordinate across Lyft's marketplace platform and BENTELER/HOLON's autonomous vehicle systems.

**AV-Hybrid Strategy — BENTELER/HOLON Orchestration Premium**

Lyft launched its AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles — integrating autonomous vehicles into Lyft's rideshare marketplace as a hybrid fleet alongside human drivers. "As an Engineering Manager, you lead the teams building the AV-Hybrid orchestration platform — recruiting, developing, and coordinating the engineers who make autonomous integration possible. Lyft is building the orchestration layer that manages mixed fleets of autonomous shuttles and human drivers — this is the most complex marketplace engineering in mobility, and managing the engineering teams behind it requires a unique blend of technical depth, cross-functional coordination, and talent strategy. The BENTELER/HOLON partnership means Lyft needs engineering managers who can build AV integration teams from scratch, manage delivery of safety monitoring systems with zero tolerance for failure, coordinate dual-mode dispatching development across multiple engineering pods, and align hybrid fleet management roadmaps with both Lyft product and BENTELER/HOLON vehicle teams. Candidates should argue for an AV-Orchestration premium of 15-20% above standard Lyft comp because managing autonomous integration engineering requires specialized leadership skills that command market premiums — comparable to what Uber pays for robotaxi engineering managers. Frame it as: 'I'm not just a rideshare engineering manager — I'm an AV-Orchestration leader building the hybrid autonomous future of mobility.'" Push for 15-20% AV-Orchestration premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **BENTELER/HOLON AV-Orchestration Premium:** "I'll be building and leading the engineering teams responsible for BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttle integration — from recruiting AV-specialized engineers to managing delivery of safety-critical fleet orchestration systems. This AV-Orchestration leadership scope commands a 15-20% premium over standard EM comp."
2. **Profitability Turnaround + AV Upside:** "Lyft's profitability validates my equity compensation, while leading the AV-Hybrid engineering team means I'm directly driving the next growth vector — my comp should reflect both the de-risked equity floor and the transformative impact of autonomous integration."
3. **40M+ Rider Marketplace:** "I'm leading engineering teams that serve 40M+ riders — adding autonomous vehicles to this marketplace is a multi-team, multi-quarter initiative that requires experienced engineering leadership at a level that commands top-of-market compensation."
4. **AV Talent Acquisition Leverage:** "The market for engineers with AV integration skills is extremely competitive — as the EM responsible for building these teams at Lyft, I need comp that positions me credibly when recruiting from Waymo, Cruise, and Uber's robotaxi division."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $240K base and $340K RSUs over 4 years with the AV-Orchestration premium for this Engineering Manager position. I'll be building and leading the teams responsible for the BENTELER/HOLON hybrid autonomous fleet orchestration platform — this requires both deep technical judgment and the ability to recruit and retain AV-specialized talent in the most competitive hiring market in tech. I have competing offers from Uber at $380K TC / Aurora at $370K TC." Accept at $220K+ base and $280K+ RSUs.
