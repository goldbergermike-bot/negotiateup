**Negotiation DNA**

Lyft Product Designers craft the experiences that 40M+ riders and millions of drivers interact with daily on the #2 US rideshare platform, owning end-to-end design from research through prototyping to production. With Lyft's profitability turnaround proving that the company can run a sustainable business, design investment is shifting toward the AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles — requiring designers who can create entirely new interaction paradigms for riders encountering autonomous vehicles within the familiar Lyft marketplace. Designing for trust, safety communication, and seamless transitions between autonomous and human-driven rides represents a frontier design challenge that demands specialized UX expertise.

**AV-Hybrid Strategy — BENTELER/HOLON Orchestration Premium**

Lyft launched its AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles — integrating autonomous vehicles into Lyft's rideshare marketplace as a hybrid fleet alongside human drivers. "As a Product Designer, you design the rider experience for the AV-Hybrid marketplace — creating interfaces that communicate autonomous vehicle status, build rider trust, and enable seamless transitions between autonomous shuttles and human-driven rides. Lyft is building the orchestration layer that manages mixed fleets of autonomous shuttles and human drivers — this is the most complex marketplace engineering in mobility, and the designer owns the human experience layer that determines whether riders adopt, trust, and prefer autonomous rides. The BENTELER/HOLON partnership means Lyft needs product designers who can design AV integration interfaces that communicate vehicle autonomy status, safety information, and ride progress clearly, create trust-building design patterns for riders' first autonomous experiences, design dual-mode rider journeys that feel coherent whether matched with a shuttle or a human driver, and establish the design system for hybrid fleet rider communication. Candidates should argue for an AV-Orchestration premium of 15-20% above standard Lyft comp because autonomous mobility UX design requires specialized expertise in trust design, safety communication, and autonomous interaction patterns that command market premiums — comparable to what Uber pays for robotaxi design roles. Frame it as: 'I'm not just a rideshare designer — I'm an AV-Orchestration experience architect building the hybrid autonomous future of mobility.'" Push for 15-20% AV-Orchestration premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **BENTELER/HOLON AV-Orchestration Premium:** "I'll be designing the rider experience for BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttle rides — from the moment a rider is matched with an autonomous vehicle through pickup, ride, and dropoff. This is frontier UX design for autonomous mobility and commands a 15-20% premium."
2. **Profitability Turnaround + AV Upside:** "Lyft's profitability secures the value of my equity, and my design work on the AV-Hybrid rider experience will directly influence adoption rates and revenue growth — my comp should reflect both the stability and the growth impact."
3. **40M+ Rider Marketplace:** "I'm designing experiences that will introduce 40M+ riders to autonomous vehicles for the first time — the trust, clarity, and delight of these designs will determine whether Lyft's AV strategy succeeds at consumer scale."
4. **Trust Design Specialization:** "Designing for rider trust in autonomous vehicles is an emerging specialization with very few experienced practitioners — I bring research-informed trust design expertise that is critical for the BENTELER/HOLON rider experience and nearly impossible to find in the market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $162K base and $160K RSUs over 4 years with the AV-Orchestration premium for this Product Designer position. I'll be designing the rider experience for BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttle integration — from trust-building interfaces to autonomous ride communication systems. This requires specialized expertise in AV UX that few designers possess. I have competing offers from Uber at $235K TC / Waymo at $248K TC." Accept at $148K+ base and $120K+ RSUs.
