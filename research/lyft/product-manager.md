**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Rideshare & Mobility Platform | BENTELER/HOLON AV-Hybrid Strategy | AV-Orchestration Premium | 4-Year Vest w/ 1-Year Cliff

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$200K | $120K–$240K | 10–15% | $205K–$285K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Lyft Product Managers define the roadmap for features and experiences that serve 40M+ riders on the #2 US rideshare platform, balancing marketplace dynamics, rider experience, and driver economics. With Lyft's profitability turnaround complete, PMs are shifting focus from efficiency optimization to strategic growth — and the AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles represents the most significant product opportunity at Lyft, requiring PMs who can define rider experiences that seamlessly blend autonomous and human-driven rides. PMs working on AV-Hybrid products must navigate regulatory requirements, rider trust, driver impact, and marketplace economics simultaneously — a product complexity that exceeds standard rideshare PM work.

**AV-Hybrid Strategy — BENTELER/HOLON Orchestration Premium**

Lyft launched its AV-Hybrid strategy with BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles — integrating autonomous vehicles into Lyft's rideshare marketplace as a hybrid fleet alongside human drivers. "As a Product Manager, you define the product vision for how riders experience the AV-Hybrid marketplace — determining when riders are matched with autonomous shuttles vs. human drivers, designing trust-building interfaces, and defining the product strategy for hybrid fleet optimization. Lyft is building the orchestration layer that manages mixed fleets of autonomous shuttles and human drivers — this is the most complex marketplace engineering in mobility, and the PM owns the product decisions that determine rider adoption, regulatory compliance, and marketplace health. The BENTELER/HOLON partnership means Lyft needs product managers who can define AV integration product requirements, design rider experiences for autonomous rides that build trust and adoption, create dual-mode matching product logic that optimizes for rider satisfaction and fleet utilization, and develop hybrid fleet product strategy that balances autonomous expansion with driver ecosystem health. Candidates should argue for an AV-Orchestration premium of 15-20% above standard Lyft comp because autonomous mobility product management requires specialized domain expertise in AV regulation, rider psychology, and marketplace economics that command market premiums — comparable to what Uber pays for robotaxi product roles. Frame it as: 'I'm not just a rideshare PM — I'm an AV-Orchestration product strategist building the hybrid autonomous future of mobility.'" Push for 15-20% AV-Orchestration premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **BENTELER/HOLON AV-Orchestration Premium:** "I'll be defining the product strategy for how BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles integrate into the Lyft rider experience — from matching algorithms to rider trust interfaces to fleet utilization optimization. AV-Orchestration product management is a specialized discipline that justifies a 15-20% premium."
2. **Profitability Turnaround + AV Upside:** "Lyft's profitability validates the equity component of my comp, and the AV-Hybrid product roadmap I'll be defining is the primary growth catalyst — my package should reflect both the de-risked base and the outsized product impact of autonomous integration."
3. **40M+ Rider Marketplace:** "I'm shaping the product experience for 40M+ riders as they encounter autonomous vehicles for the first time in the Lyft marketplace — the product decisions I make around trust, transparency, and ride quality will determine the adoption trajectory for Lyft's entire AV strategy."
4. **Regulatory & Trust Product Expertise:** "Building products that navigate AV regulatory frameworks while maintaining rider trust requires specialized PM skills that are extremely scarce — few PMs have experience defining product requirements at the intersection of autonomous technology and consumer mobility."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $195K base and $230K RSUs over 4 years with the AV-Orchestration premium for this Product Manager position. I'll be defining the product strategy for how BENTELER/HOLON autonomous shuttles are experienced by 40M+ Lyft riders — from trust-building interfaces to dual-mode matching to regulatory compliance. This is the most consequential PM role in the mobility sector. I have competing offers from Uber at $295K TC / Waymo at $310K TC." Accept at $180K+ base and $180K+ RSUs.
