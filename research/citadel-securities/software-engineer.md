#### Compensation Overview

Citadel Securities compensates entirely in cash — there is no public equity component. Total compensation consists of Base Salary plus a Performance Bonus, paid annually. As the world's largest market maker handling approximately 25% of all US equity volume, Citadel Securities pays at the very top of the software engineering market.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Chicago (HQ) | $175K - $225K | $150K - $240K | $325K - $465K |
| New York | $185K - $235K | $155K - $250K | $340K - $485K |
| London | £140K - £180K / $175K - $225K | £120K - £190K / $150K - $240K | £260K - £370K / $325K - $465K |

#### Negotiation DNA

Software Engineers at Citadel Securities are Liquidity Guardians — they build and maintain the systems that power one-quarter of all US equity trading. This is not a typical software engineering role. Every line of code directly impacts market-making operations, order execution latency, and ultimately the firm's $8.4B revenue engine. The structural tightness of the labor market for engineers who can operate at nanosecond-scale latency requirements gives candidates significant leverage. Citadel Securities competes directly with Jane Street, Two Sigma, and Jump Trading for the same elite talent pool, and Ken Griffin's adjacent hedge fund (Citadel LLC) further intensifies internal demand for top-tier engineers.

#### $8.4B Revenue Engine — The Liquidity Guardian Premium

Citadel Securities generated $8.4 billion in revenue and delivered a $5 billion investor payout, making it the most profitable market-making operation in history. Software Engineers are the foundation of this revenue engine. Every trading system, every matching engine optimization, every microsecond shaved from execution latency translates directly into captured spread and market-making alpha.

The Liquidity Guardian Premium exists because Citadel Securities cannot generate $8.4B without engineers who understand both systems programming and market microstructure. The firm handles 25% of all US equity volume — a position that demands absolute reliability, zero-downtime deployments, and latency-sensitive architecture that most software engineers have never encountered. This scarcity commands a premium that places Citadel Securities compensation 15-30% above Big Tech for equivalent experience levels.

Ken Griffin has publicly stated that technology is the firm's primary competitive advantage. The separation between Citadel LLC (hedge fund) and Citadel Securities (market maker) creates a dual-demand dynamic where both entities compete for the same engineering talent, further inflating compensation.

#### Global Levers

1. **Competing Offer Escalation:** "I have a competing offer from Jane Street at $350K total compensation. Given Citadel Securities' all-cash structure and the critical nature of the liquidity systems I'd be building, I'd expect the total package to reflect the Liquidity Guardian premium — $425K minimum to move forward."

2. **Latency Expertise Premium:** "My experience with ultra-low-latency systems in C++ and kernel-bypass networking is directly applicable to your market-making infrastructure. Engineers with this specific skill set command a premium in the current market — I'm targeting $200K+ base to reflect that scarcity."

3. **Bonus Structure Transparency:** "I understand that Citadel Securities' bonus pool is driven by firm-wide revenue performance. With $8.4B in revenue and a $5B payout, I'd like to understand the guaranteed vs. discretionary bonus split and negotiate a first-year guaranteed minimum bonus of $175K."

4. **Regional Arbitrage:** "I'm considering both your Chicago HQ and New York roles. While I understand Chicago is headquarters, the New York market demands a cost-of-living adjustment. I'd expect a $15K-$25K base premium for the New York position, bringing the base to $210K+."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $210K base and $200K bonus ($410K TC). Reference competing offers from Jane Street ($350K-$400K TC) or Two Sigma ($325K-$375K TC) as your floor. Push for a first-year guaranteed bonus of at least $175K given Citadel Securities' discretionary bonus model. If the firm counters below $190K base, request a sign-on bonus of $50K-$75K to bridge the gap. **Accept at $190K+ base and $160K+ bonus ($350K+ TC).** Walk away below $175K base — at that level, Big Tech RSU packages become more attractive on a risk-adjusted basis.
