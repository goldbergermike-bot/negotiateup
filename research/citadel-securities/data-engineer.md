#### Compensation Overview

Citadel Securities compensates entirely in cash — there is no public equity component. Total compensation consists of Base Salary plus a Performance Bonus. Data Engineers at Citadel Securities build and maintain the data infrastructure that ingests, processes, and distributes the massive volumes of market data required for real-time market making across 25% of all US equity volume.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Chicago (HQ) | $190K - $250K | $175K - $275K | $365K - $525K |
| New York | $200K - $265K | $185K - $290K | $385K - $555K |
| London | £150K - £200K / $190K - $250K | £140K - £220K / $175K - $275K | £290K - £420K / $365K - $525K |

#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at Citadel Securities are Liquidity Guardians who build the data backbone of the world's largest market-making operation. This is not a typical data engineering role — the data volumes are staggering (billions of market data events per day), the latency requirements are measured in microseconds, and the reliability expectations are absolute. Data Engineers build real-time streaming pipelines that feed pricing models, construct historical data stores for backtesting and research, design market data normalization layers across dozens of exchanges, and ensure that every component of the $8.4B revenue engine has access to the data it needs at the speed it requires.

The structurally tight labor market for data engineers who understand both modern data infrastructure (Kafka, Spark, custom streaming frameworks) and the unique requirements of financial market data creates genuine leverage. Citadel Securities competes with Jane Street, Two Sigma, and Jump Trading for engineers who can build data systems that operate at the intersection of massive scale and microsecond latency — a combination that very few data engineers have ever encountered.

#### $8.4B Revenue Engine — The Liquidity Guardian Premium

Citadel Securities generated $8.4 billion in revenue and delivered a $5 billion investor payout. Data Engineers are the plumbing of this revenue engine — unglamorous but absolutely essential. Without reliable, low-latency data infrastructure, pricing models cannot update, risk systems cannot calculate, and traders cannot make informed decisions. The $8.4B is generated by systems that consume and process data — every dollar of revenue depends on data arriving at the right place, at the right time, in the right format.

The Liquidity Guardian Premium for Data Engineers reflects the foundational nature of their work. Market-making at 25% of US equity volume means processing market data from every major US exchange, multiple dark pools, and international venues — all in real time. A data pipeline failure or latency spike doesn't just create an engineering incident; it creates a trading incident that can result in millions in lost revenue or adverse fills.

Data Engineers at Citadel Securities also build the historical data infrastructure that enables the firm's quantitative research — the research that continuously improves market-making strategies and drives revenue growth. The firm's unparalleled dataset, generated by its market-leading position, is only valuable if it can be stored, queried, and analyzed efficiently. Ken Griffin's dual entities — Citadel LLC (hedge fund) and Citadel Securities (market maker) — both require sophisticated data infrastructure, creating intense demand for data engineering talent.

#### Global Levers

1. **Data-to-Revenue Pipeline:** "Every pricing decision, every risk calculation, every trade execution at Citadel Securities depends on data infrastructure I would build and maintain. With $8.4B in revenue flowing through these data pipelines, their reliability and performance have direct P&L impact. I'm targeting $240K base and $240K+ bonus for a $480K total package."

2. **Real-Time Data Engineering Scarcity:** "Data Engineers who can build microsecond-latency streaming pipelines at the scale of 25% of US equity volume are exceptionally rare. I have competing offers from Two Sigma ($425K TC) and a FAANG ($400K TC with RSUs). Given Citadel Securities' unique data scale, I'd need $475K+ total compensation."

3. **Guaranteed Bonus Protection:** "Data engineering roles can be undervalued in discretionary bonus cycles relative to direct trading roles. I need a first-year guaranteed bonus of $215K to ensure my compensation reflects the revenue-critical nature of data infrastructure, not a cost-center allocation."

4. **Dataset Intellectual Contribution:** "The data architectures and pipelines I design become part of Citadel Securities' competitive moat — they enable the firm to leverage its unique dataset more effectively than any competitor. This intellectual contribution to the firm's long-term advantage justifies a premium. I'd expect $235K+ base and $250K+ bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $245K base and $250K bonus ($495K TC). Present competing offers from Two Sigma ($400K-$450K TC) and Big Tech data engineering roles ($375K-$425K TC with RSUs). Push for a first-year guaranteed bonus of at least $215K given the discretionary model. Request a sign-on bonus of $50K-$75K if forfeiting unvested compensation. Emphasize the foundational nature of data infrastructure for the $8.4B revenue engine. **Accept at $210K+ base and $195K+ bonus ($405K+ TC).** Walk away below $195K base — at that level, Big Tech data engineering roles with RSU packages and lower operational intensity become more attractive on a risk-adjusted basis.
