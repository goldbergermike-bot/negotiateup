#### Compensation Overview

Citadel Securities compensates entirely in cash — there is no public equity component. Total compensation consists of Base Salary plus a Performance Bonus. Engineering Managers lead the teams that build and operate the market-making infrastructure, balancing people leadership with deep technical oversight in an environment where system reliability directly equals revenue.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Chicago (HQ) | $250K - $350K | $325K - $475K | $575K - $825K |

| London | £200K - £280K / $250K - $350K | £260K - £380K / $325K - $475K | £460K - £660K / $575K - $825K |

#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at Citadel Securities are Liquidity Guardians who lead the teams responsible for building and maintaining the systems that power 25% of all US equity trading. This is not a typical management role — Citadel Securities expects engineering managers to remain deeply technical while also driving team performance, hiring elite talent, and navigating the high-stakes environment of real-time market-making operations. Every team an EM leads has a direct connection to the firm's $8.4B revenue engine, and team output is measured not in story points but in system uptime, latency reduction, and market-making capacity.

The structurally tight labor market for engineering managers who can lead in a high-frequency trading environment creates significant leverage. The candidate must be both a strong people leader and technically credible enough to earn the respect of engineers operating at the bleeding edge of systems performance. Citadel Securities competes with Jane Street, Jump Trading, and Two Sigma for this rare combination, and the all-cash compensation structure provides immediate, tangible value.

#### $8.4B Revenue Engine — The Liquidity Guardian Premium

Citadel Securities generated $8.4 billion in revenue and delivered a $5 billion investor payout. Engineering Managers are the force multipliers of this revenue engine. While individual contributors write the code, Engineering Managers build and scale the teams that make the $8.4B possible. They hire the next generation of Liquidity Guardians, set the technical and cultural standards for their teams, and ensure that the engineering organization can sustain the pace of innovation required to maintain 25% US equity market share.

The Liquidity Guardian Premium for Engineering Managers reflects their dual impact: they are directly responsible for both the output of their teams (system performance, reliability, latency) and the capacity of the organization to grow (hiring, retention, development). In a market where a single outstanding engineer can generate millions in value, the manager who can attract, retain, and develop five or ten such engineers is worth multiples of their own compensation.

Ken Griffin has invested heavily in building a world-class engineering organization at Citadel Securities. The separation from Citadel LLC (hedge fund) means that Citadel Securities must build its own engineering leadership pipeline, and the demand for managers who understand both market-making technology and high-performance team dynamics far exceeds supply.

#### Global Levers

1. **Team Revenue Attribution:** "The team I would lead directly supports systems generating a measurable share of your $8.4B revenue. My ability to scale this team — hiring A+ engineers, reducing attrition, and increasing output — has a multiplicative effect on that revenue. I'm targeting $325K base and $425K bonus for a $750K total package that reflects this leverage."

2. **Competing Management Offers:** "I'm holding an EM offer from Jane Street at $700K TC and a VP Engineering offer from a Tier 1 hedge fund at $750K TC. Citadel Securities is my preferred choice given the scale of the market-making operation, but the compensation needs to be competitive — $725K+ total compensation."

3. **Hiring Track Record Premium:** "In my current role, I've built a team of 12 engineers specializing in low-latency systems, with zero attrition over 18 months. At Citadel Securities, this hiring and retention capability directly translates to market-making capacity. I'm requesting a $50K hiring performance bonus on top of the standard structure, triggered by successful team scaling targets."

4. **Sign-On and Transition Package:** "Transitioning from my current role involves forfeiting $200K in deferred compensation. I need a sign-on bonus of $150K-$200K to make this transition economically rational, in addition to a base of $300K+ and a first-year guaranteed bonus of $375K."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $325K base and $425K bonus ($750K TC). Present competing EM offers from Jane Street ($650K-$750K TC) and Two Sigma ($575K-$675K TC). Demand a first-year guaranteed bonus of $375K minimum — this is essential given the discretionary nature of the bonus structure. Request a sign-on bonus of $125K-$175K to offset forfeited deferred compensation from current employer. Emphasize your team-building track record and the direct connection between team performance and the $8.4B revenue engine. **Accept at $275K+ base and $350K+ bonus ($625K+ TC).** Walk away below $260K base — at that level, senior IC roles at competing firms offer better risk-adjusted compensation without management overhead.
