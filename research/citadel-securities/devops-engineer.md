#### Compensation Overview

Citadel Securities compensates entirely in cash — there is no public equity component. Total compensation consists of Base Salary plus a Performance Bonus. DevOps Engineers at Citadel Securities maintain the infrastructure backbone that supports the world's largest market-making operation — where system uptime is not a metric but a revenue prerequisite.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |

| Chicago (HQ) | $175K - $225K | $150K - $240K | $325K - $465K |

#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at Citadel Securities are Liquidity Guardians who ensure the infrastructure that powers 25% of all US equity trading operates with absolute reliability, performance, and security. This is not a typical DevOps role — every deployment, every infrastructure change, every monitoring decision occurs in an environment where a single minute of downtime can cost millions in lost market-making revenue. DevOps Engineers at Citadel Securities manage bare-metal and cloud-hybrid infrastructure, build CI/CD pipelines for latency-sensitive trading systems, implement network optimization at the kernel level, and operate monitoring systems that track microsecond-level performance deviations.

The structurally tight labor market for DevOps engineers who understand low-latency infrastructure and financial system requirements creates genuine leverage. Citadel Securities competes with Jane Street, Jump Trading, and Virtu Financial for infrastructure talent that can operate in environments where "five nines" uptime is a minimum expectation and where infrastructure performance directly impacts trading latency and revenue capture.

#### $8.4B Revenue Engine — The Liquidity Guardian Premium

Citadel Securities generated $8.4 billion in revenue and delivered a $5 billion investor payout. DevOps Engineers are the reliability foundation of this revenue engine. The $8.4B is only possible because the infrastructure operates continuously — markets are open, and Citadel Securities must be present and responsive every second of every trading day. A single infrastructure failure during peak market hours could result in lost market-making opportunities worth millions.

The Liquidity Guardian Premium for DevOps Engineers reflects the asymmetric nature of their impact: when infrastructure works perfectly, the firm generates $8.4B in revenue; when it fails, the losses are immediate, measurable, and potentially catastrophic. This asymmetry means that DevOps Engineers at Citadel Securities are not cost-center employees — they are revenue-protection assets.

The firm handles 25% of all US equity volume across a technology stack that spans bare-metal servers in co-located data centers, custom networking hardware, and sophisticated monitoring systems. DevOps Engineers who can manage this scale while maintaining the latency and reliability requirements of high-frequency market making are exceptionally scarce. The separation between Ken Griffin's Citadel LLC (hedge fund) and Citadel Securities (market maker) means two entities drawing from the same limited pool of financial infrastructure talent.

#### Global Levers

1. **Uptime Revenue Protection:** "Every minute of downtime in your market-making infrastructure represents measurable lost revenue — at $8.4B annually, that's roughly $16M per trading hour. My expertise in building zero-downtime deployment systems and real-time monitoring directly protects this revenue. I'm targeting $210K base and $200K+ bonus for a $410K total package."

2. **Low-Latency Infra Competing Offers:** "I have a competing offer from Jump Trading at $375K TC for an infrastructure role focused on HFT systems. I also have an SRE offer from a FAANG at $350K TC with RSUs. Given Citadel Securities' scale at 25% of US equity volume, I'd need $400K+ total compensation to commit."

3. **Guaranteed Bonus Floor:** "Infrastructure roles are sometimes undervalued in discretionary bonus cycles relative to direct trading or research roles. I need a first-year guaranteed bonus of $175K to ensure my compensation reflects the revenue-protection value I provide, not just a cost-center allocation."

4. **On-Call and Market Hours Premium:** "DevOps at a market maker means on-call responsibility during all US market hours and often global market hours. This operational intensity exceeds typical tech DevOps roles. I'd expect a $15K-$25K base premium and structured on-call compensation on top of the base package."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $215K base and $210K bonus ($425K TC). Present competing offers from Jump Trading ($350K-$400K TC) and Big Tech SRE roles ($325K-$375K TC with RSUs). Push for a first-year guaranteed bonus of at least $175K given the discretionary bonus model. Request a sign-on bonus of $40K-$60K if forfeiting unvested RSUs from current employer. Emphasize the revenue-protection value of infrastructure reliability and the direct link to the $8.4B engine. **Accept at $185K+ base and $165K+ bonus ($350K+ TC).** Walk away below $175K base — at that level, SRE roles at Big Tech with RSU packages and lower operational intensity become strictly preferable.
