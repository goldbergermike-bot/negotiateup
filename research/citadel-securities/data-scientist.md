#### Compensation Overview

Citadel Securities compensates entirely in cash — there is no public equity component. Total compensation consists of Base Salary plus a Performance Bonus. Data Scientists at Citadel Securities operate in a uniquely quantitative environment where statistical modeling, market microstructure analysis, and execution quality research directly drive the firm's competitive advantage as the world's largest market maker.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Chicago (HQ) | $200K - $275K | $225K - $340K | $425K - $615K |

#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at Citadel Securities are Liquidity Guardians who use statistical analysis, machine learning, and quantitative research to optimize every aspect of the firm's market-making operations. This is not a typical data science role — every analysis directly connects to the $8.4B revenue engine. Data Scientists at Citadel Securities study execution quality, model adverse selection, optimize quoting strategies, analyze market impact, and research the microstructure dynamics that determine whether the firm captures or loses spread across 25% of all US equity volume.

The structurally tight labor market for data scientists who combine statistical rigor with deep financial market knowledge creates significant negotiation leverage. Citadel Securities competes directly with Jane Street's quantitative research teams, Two Sigma's data science organization, and Jump Trading's research group for the same pool of PhDs and quantitatively trained professionals. The all-cash compensation structure means candidates capture the full value immediately, unlike Big Tech roles where a significant portion of total comp is locked in multi-year RSU vesting schedules.

#### $8.4B Revenue Engine — The Liquidity Guardian Premium

Citadel Securities generated $8.4 billion in revenue and delivered a $5 billion investor payout. Data Scientists are the analytical intelligence layer of this revenue engine. They build the models that determine how the firm quotes, when it widens or tightens spreads, how it manages inventory risk, and where it allocates capital across thousands of securities.

The Liquidity Guardian Premium for Data Scientists is driven by the direct connection between their research output and trading P&L. A Data Scientist who discovers a better way to model adverse selection — identifying when an incoming order is likely informed versus uninformed — can generate tens of millions in annualized value by enabling tighter quotes on uninformed flow. Similarly, research into optimal inventory management strategies directly determines how much capital the firm can deploy and how much risk it can efficiently absorb.

Handling 25% of all US equity volume means Citadel Securities generates an unparalleled dataset of market activity. Data Scientists who can extract signal from this data have access to a resource that no other firm can replicate. The $8.4B revenue is, in essence, the monetization of the insights these scientists extract. Ken Griffin's dual entities — Citadel LLC (hedge fund) and Citadel Securities (market maker) — both compete intensely for quantitative talent, further compressing supply and elevating compensation.

#### Global Levers

1. **Research-to-P&L Attribution:** "My research would directly optimize your quoting strategies and execution quality — the core mechanisms of your $8.4B revenue engine. Data Scientists who can model market microstructure at this level of sophistication are rare. I'm targeting $260K base and $300K+ bonus for a $560K total package."

2. **Quantitative Competing Offers:** "I have competing offers from Two Sigma ($500K TC) and Jane Street ($525K TC), both in quantitative research roles. Citadel Securities' unique dataset from 25% of US equity volume is compelling, but the compensation needs to reflect the opportunity cost — $550K+ total compensation."

3. **PhD Premium and Guaranteed Bonus:** "My PhD in [statistics/physics/applied math] and published research in market microstructure represent years of specialized training. I need a first-year guaranteed bonus of $275K and a base of $250K+ to reflect this expertise premium."

4. **Dataset Access Premium:** "Citadel Securities' proprietary dataset — generated by making markets in 25% of all US equities — is unmatched in the industry. The research I can do with this data is uniquely valuable. However, this cuts both ways — my insights become proprietary to the firm. I need compensation that reflects both the access value and the intellectual property I'm contributing: $575K+ total compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $265K base and $310K bonus ($575K TC). Stack competing offers from Jane Street ($475K-$575K TC), Two Sigma ($450K-$525K TC), and D.E. Shaw ($400K-$500K TC). Demand a first-year guaranteed bonus of at least $275K — critical given the discretionary bonus model. Push for a sign-on bonus of $75K-$100K if transitioning from academia or a role with deferred compensation. Emphasize the direct research-to-P&L pipeline and the scarcity of market microstructure expertise. **Accept at $225K+ base and $250K+ bonus ($475K+ TC).** Walk away below $210K base — at that point, quantitative research roles at competing firms with more transparent bonus structures become preferable.
