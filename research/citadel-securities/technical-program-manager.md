#### Compensation Overview

Citadel Securities compensates entirely in cash — there is no public equity component. Total compensation consists of Base Salary plus a Performance Bonus. Technical Program Managers at Citadel Securities drive the delivery of complex, cross-functional technology programs that directly support the firm's market-making operations — from platform migrations to new asset class launches.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Chicago (HQ) | $185K - $240K | $165K - $260K | $350K - $500K |
| New York | $195K - $255K | $175K - $275K | $370K - $530K |
| London | £150K - £190K / $185K - $240K | £130K - £210K / $165K - $260K | £280K - £400K / $350K - $500K |

#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at Citadel Securities are Liquidity Guardians who orchestrate the delivery of mission-critical technology programs across the firm's engineering, trading, and operations organizations. This is not a typical TPM role — every program directly impacts the infrastructure that handles 25% of all US equity volume, and delays or failures in program delivery have measurable revenue consequences. TPMs at Citadel Securities manage platform upgrades that must be deployed without disrupting live trading, coordinate cross-team initiatives that span multiple asset classes, and drive regulatory technology programs with hard deadlines and zero tolerance for failure.

The structurally tight labor market for TPMs who understand both large-scale program management and financial technology creates genuine leverage. Citadel Securities competes with Jane Street, Two Sigma, and Jump Trading for professionals who can manage the intersection of engineering complexity, trading urgency, and regulatory compliance. The all-cash compensation model means candidates see the full value of their package from day one.

#### $8.4B Revenue Engine — The Liquidity Guardian Premium

Citadel Securities generated $8.4 billion in revenue and delivered a $5 billion investor payout. Technical Program Managers are the delivery engine that ensures the technology powering this revenue is built, tested, and deployed on time and without disruption. The $8.4B is not generated by technology alone — it requires that technology be delivered reliably, that platform upgrades happen seamlessly, and that new capabilities launch when the business needs them.

The Liquidity Guardian Premium for TPMs reflects their role as the critical coordination layer between engineering teams, trading desks, risk management, and operations. When Citadel Securities enters a new market or asset class, it is the TPM who builds the program plan, manages dependencies across dozens of teams, and ensures that the launch happens on schedule. When regulatory deadlines approach, it is the TPM who ensures the technology organization meets compliance requirements without sacrificing market-making performance.

The firm handles 25% of all US equity volume — a position that requires constant technology evolution. Every platform upgrade, every system migration, every new feature rollout must be coordinated to avoid any disruption to live trading. TPMs who can manage this level of complexity in a high-stakes financial environment are rare, and the $8.4B revenue engine depends on their execution. Ken Griffin's dual entities create additional program management demand as initiatives often span both Citadel LLC and Citadel Securities.

#### Global Levers

1. **Program Revenue Enablement:** "The programs I would drive — new asset class launches, platform migrations, regulatory implementations — directly enable or protect your $8.4B revenue. A delayed platform upgrade can cost millions in lost market-making capacity. I'm targeting $230K base and $225K+ bonus for a $455K total package."

2. **Competing TPM Offers:** "I hold a TPM offer from Two Sigma at $400K TC and a senior program manager offer from a FAANG at $425K TC with RSUs. Given the mission-critical nature of program delivery at Citadel Securities and the scale of 25% US equity volume, I'd need $450K+ total compensation."

3. **Guaranteed Bonus Protection:** "TPM roles are sometimes categorized as overhead in discretionary bonus cycles, despite their direct revenue enablement. I need a first-year guaranteed bonus of $200K to ensure my compensation reflects the criticality of program delivery to the $8.4B engine."

4. **Regulatory Program Expertise:** "My experience managing regulatory technology programs — SEC, FINRA, MiFID II — is directly applicable to Citadel Securities' compliance obligations. This regulatory TPM expertise is exceptionally scarce and commands a $20K-$30K base premium, bringing base to $250K+."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $235K base and $230K bonus ($465K TC). Present competing offers from Two Sigma ($375K-$425K TC) and Big Tech senior TPM roles ($400K-$450K TC with RSUs). Push for a first-year guaranteed bonus of at least $200K given the discretionary model. Request a sign-on bonus of $40K-$65K if forfeiting unvested compensation. Emphasize the direct link between program delivery and the $8.4B revenue engine. **Accept at $200K+ base and $185K+ bonus ($385K+ TC).** Walk away below $190K base — at that level, senior TPM roles at Big Tech with RSU packages and lower operational intensity become more attractive.
