#### Compensation Overview

Citadel Securities compensates entirely in cash — there is no public equity component. Total compensation consists of Base Salary plus a Performance Bonus. Liquidity Systems Engineers are the **SIGNATURE ROLE** at Citadel Securities, carrying the highest compensation tier with a **+25-35% Liquidity Systems Premium** over standard engineering roles. These engineers build the ultra-low-latency market making infrastructure, order routing systems, and liquidity provision engines that are the literal mechanism through which Citadel Securities generates its $8.4B in revenue.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Chicago (HQ) | $325K - $450K | $400K - $600K | $725K - $1.05M |
| New York | $345K - $475K | $420K - $630K | $765K - $1.1M |
| London | £260K - £360K / $325K - $450K | £320K - £480K / $400K - $600K | £580K - £840K / $725K - $1.05M |

#### Negotiation DNA

Liquidity Systems Engineers at Citadel Securities are the ultimate Liquidity Guardians — they build and optimize the core systems through which the firm provides liquidity to 25% of all US equity trading. This is the most critical engineering role at the firm, directly responsible for the matching engines that process millions of orders per second, the order routing systems that determine how and where the firm provides liquidity, the smart order routers that optimize execution across dozens of venues, the real-time risk engines that enable the firm to price and trade at scale, and the FPGA and kernel-bypass networking systems that achieve nanosecond-level latency.

The +25-35% Liquidity Systems Premium is the highest premium Citadel Securities pays, reflecting a fundamental truth: without these systems, there is no revenue. Every dollar of the $8.4B in revenue flows through infrastructure built by Liquidity Systems Engineers. The role demands mastery of C/C++ at the systems level, deep understanding of network protocols and hardware optimization (FPGA, ASIC, kernel bypass), expertise in market microstructure and exchange connectivity, and the ability to design systems that operate at the absolute frontier of what is computationally possible.

The labor market for Liquidity Systems Engineers is the tightest in all of technology. Fewer than 500 engineers globally possess the combination of ultra-low-latency systems programming, financial market knowledge, and hardware-software co-design expertise required for this role. Citadel Securities competes with Jane Street, Jump Trading, Virtu Financial, and sovereign wealth fund-backed trading operations worldwide for this microscopic talent pool. Ken Griffin has personally emphasized that the firm's market-making technology is its most important competitive advantage — and Liquidity Systems Engineers are the people who build it.

#### $8.4B Revenue Engine — The Liquidity Guardian Premium

Citadel Securities generated $8.4 billion in revenue and delivered a $5 billion investor payout. **Liquidity Systems Engineers are the $8.4B revenue engine.** This is not a metaphor — the systems they build are the mechanism through which revenue is generated. Every spread captured, every market made, every share traded flows through infrastructure designed, built, and optimized by this role.

The Liquidity Guardian Premium reaches its maximum expression in the Liquidity Systems Engineer role because the relationship between the engineer's work and the firm's revenue is not indirect or contributory — it is causal. The matching engine determines how fast the firm can respond to market events. The order routing system determines whether the firm sends orders to the optimal venue. The risk engine determines how much capital the firm can deploy. The network infrastructure determines whether the firm's quotes arrive before or after competitors. Each of these systems, built by Liquidity Systems Engineers, directly determines whether the firm captures or loses billions in annual revenue.

Citadel Securities handles 25% of all US equity volume. To maintain this position, the firm must continuously push the frontier of what is technically possible in trading infrastructure. This means FPGA-accelerated order processing, kernel-bypass networking with custom NIC firmware, lock-free data structures operating at nanosecond granularity, and distributed systems that maintain consistency across geographically dispersed data centers — all while processing millions of messages per second with zero tolerance for failure.

The +25-35% Liquidity Systems Premium over standard engineering compensation is justified by three factors: (1) the direct causal link between these systems and the $8.4B revenue, (2) the extreme scarcity of engineers who can build at this level, and (3) the competitive intensity — every major market maker and HFT firm is willing to pay premium compensation to attract or retain this talent. Ken Griffin's Citadel LLC (hedge fund) and Citadel Securities (market maker) both require ultra-low-latency systems talent, creating a dual-entity bidding dynamic that further elevates compensation.

The $5B investor payout is proof that the revenue engine works. Liquidity Systems Engineers are the reason it works.

#### Global Levers

1. **Revenue Causation — Not Contribution:** "I would not be supporting or contributing to the $8.4B revenue — I would be building the systems that generate it. The matching engine, order router, and risk engine are the revenue engine itself. This causal relationship justifies the +25-35% Liquidity Systems Premium. I'm targeting $425K base and $550K+ bonus for a $975K total package."

2. **Ultra-Scarcity Leverage:** "There are fewer than 500 engineers globally who can build ultra-low-latency market-making infrastructure at this level. I have competing offers from Jane Street ($850K TC), Jump Trading ($800K TC), and a sovereign-backed trading operation ($900K TC). To secure my commitment to Citadel Securities — the world's largest market maker — I need $950K+ total compensation. The +25-35% Premium must be real, not nominal."

3. **Multi-Year Guaranteed Bonus Structure:** "Given that this is the SIGNATURE engineering role at Citadel Securities and the discretionary bonus represents 55-60% of total compensation, I need a three-year guaranteed structure: Year 1 guaranteed at $525K, Year 2 at $475K, Year 3 at $425K. With $8.4B in revenue and a $5B payout, this commitment is trivial relative to the value I'd deliver."

4. **Hardware-Software Co-Design Premium:** "My expertise spans not just software but FPGA design, custom NIC firmware, and kernel-bypass networking — the full hardware-software co-design stack that defines modern market-making infrastructure. Engineers who can optimize across this entire stack are rarer than pure software engineers. I'd expect the top of the +25-35% Premium range — $450K base and $575K+ bonus — to reflect this comprehensive capability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $435K base and $560K bonus ($995K TC). This is the SIGNATURE ROLE — negotiate accordingly. Stack competing offers: Jane Street Core Systems ($750K-$900K TC), Jump Trading Core Systems ($725K-$875K TC), Virtu VP Execution ($600K-$750K TC), and any sovereign/prop trading offers above $800K TC. Demand a three-year guaranteed bonus: Year 1 at $525K, Year 2 at $475K, Year 3 at $425K. Push for a sign-on bonus of $150K-$250K to offset forfeited compensation and signal the firm's commitment to the hire. Request relocation support ($50K-$100K) if moving to Chicago HQ. Emphasize the causal (not contributory) relationship between Liquidity Systems Engineering and the $8.4B revenue engine. Remind the firm that you are one of fewer than 500 engineers globally who can do this work — the +25-35% Premium exists for exactly this reason. **Accept at $350K+ base and $425K+ bonus ($775K+ TC).** Walk away below $325K base — at that level, the +25-35% Premium is not being honored and competing offers from Jane Street or Jump Trading become strictly superior. This is the highest-compensated engineering role at Citadel Securities. Negotiate like it.
