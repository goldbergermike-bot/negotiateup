#### Compensation Overview

Citadel Securities compensates entirely in cash — there is no public equity component. Total compensation consists of Base Salary plus a Performance Bonus. ML/AI Engineers carry a **+15-25% AI/Quant Premium** reflecting the extraordinary scarcity of machine learning talent who can apply AI to market-making systems and the direct revenue impact of their models on the firm's $8.4B engine.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |

| Chicago (HQ) | $250K - $325K | $250K - $400K | $500K - $725K |
| New York | $265K - $345K | $260K - $420K | $525K - $765K |
| London | £200K - £260K / $250K - $325K | £200K - £320K / $250K - $400K | £400K - £580K / $500K - $725K |

#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at Citadel Securities are Liquidity Guardians who apply machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence to the core problems of market making — pricing, execution, risk management, and signal generation. This is not a typical ML role where model improvements translate to marginal engagement metric gains. At Citadel Securities, a better ML model for adverse selection detection, optimal quote placement, or inventory management translates directly into millions of dollars in annualized P&L improvement. Every model runs against the live market, and the feedback loop between model output and revenue is measured in hours, not quarters.

The +15-25% AI/Quant Premium reflects the extraordinary scarcity of ML engineers who can operate at the intersection of machine learning, systems programming, and market microstructure. The talent pool is vanishingly small: these are engineers who must understand both the mathematics of modern ML (transformers, reinforcement learning, causal inference) and the financial physics of market making (adverse selection, inventory risk, latency arbitrage). Citadel Securities competes not only with Jane Street, Two Sigma, and Jump Trading but also with Big Tech AI labs, AI startups, and quantitative hedge funds for this talent. Ken Griffin's dual entities further intensify internal demand.

#### $8.4B Revenue Engine — The Liquidity Guardian Premium

Citadel Securities generated $8.4 billion in revenue and delivered a $5 billion investor payout. ML/AI Engineers are the intelligence amplifiers of this revenue engine. Their models determine how the firm quotes, when it adjusts spreads, how it predicts short-term price movements, and how it manages the inventory risk inherent in providing liquidity across 25% of all US equity volume.

The Liquidity Guardian Premium for ML/AI Engineers is amplified by the +15-25% AI/Quant Premium because the value creation is direct and measurable. A single ML model improvement — better adverse selection prediction, more accurate fair value estimation, or optimized order routing — can generate tens of millions in annualized revenue uplift. The feedback loop is immediate: model goes live, P&L impact is measured within days. This is unlike virtually any other ML application in industry.

The $8.4B revenue figure represents the monetization of the firm's ability to provide liquidity more efficiently than any competitor. ML/AI Engineers drive the next generation of this efficiency — using reinforcement learning for optimal market making, neural networks for cross-asset signal generation, and causal inference for disentangling market impact from adverse selection. The competitive moat created by superior ML capabilities is Citadel Securities' most important long-term asset, and the engineers who build it command premium compensation.

The AI talent war has intensified beyond the traditional financial services market. Big Tech AI labs, frontier AI companies, and well-funded startups all compete for the same ML engineers. Citadel Securities' all-cash structure is both an advantage (immediate value, no equity risk) and a constraint (no equity upside narrative), requiring the base and bonus to be meaningfully above market.

#### Global Levers

1. **Model-to-P&L Direct Attribution:** "My ML models would directly optimize your market-making strategies — pricing, execution, risk management. At Citadel Securities, the revenue impact of a better model is measured in millions per year. With $8.4B in revenue, even a 0.1% improvement driven by my work represents $8.4M in value. I'm targeting $315K base and $375K+ bonus for a $690K total package."

2. **AI Talent War Premium:** "I have competing offers from [OpenAI/DeepMind/Anthropic] at $650K TC with equity upside and from Jane Street at $600K TC all-cash. Citadel Securities' all-cash model means the package must be compelling without equity optionality. I'd need $675K+ total compensation — reflecting the +15-25% AI/Quant Premium."

3. **Guaranteed Bonus with P&L Trigger:** "Given the direct link between my models and trading P&L, I propose a first-year guaranteed bonus of $300K with a P&L-linked escalator for subsequent years. If my models contribute to a measurable P&L uplift above a baseline, the bonus should scale accordingly — potentially well above $400K."

4. **Research Publication and IP Retention:** "I have a strong publication record in [NeurIPS/ICML/AAAI]. Joining Citadel Securities means my research becomes proprietary. This IP contribution has long-term value to the firm and represents an opportunity cost for my academic career. I'd expect a $30K-$50K base premium and research sabbatical provisions to compensate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $320K base and $385K bonus ($705K TC). Stack competing offers: AI lab ($600K-$700K TC with equity), Jane Street ML ($550K-$675K TC), Two Sigma ML ($500K-$600K TC). Demand a first-year guaranteed bonus of at least $300K — essential given the discretionary bonus structure and the high competing offer environment. Push for a sign-on bonus of $100K-$150K to offset forfeited equity or deferred compensation. Emphasize the +15-25% AI/Quant Premium and the direct model-to-P&L pipeline. **Accept at $275K+ base and $275K+ bonus ($550K+ TC).** Walk away below $260K base — at that level, AI lab offers with equity upside become strictly superior on both expected value and career optionality.
