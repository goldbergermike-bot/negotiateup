#### Compensation Overview

Citadel Securities compensates entirely in cash — there is no public equity component. Total compensation consists of Base Salary plus a Performance Bonus. Senior Software Engineers are critical individual contributors who own major subsystems within the market-making infrastructure, commanding compensation that reflects both their technical depth and their direct revenue impact on the $8.4B engine.

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Chicago (HQ) | $225K - $300K | $240K - $375K | $465K - $675K |

#### Negotiation DNA

Senior Software Engineers at Citadel Securities are Liquidity Guardians who own the architecture and implementation of systems that directly enable one-quarter of all US equity trading. At this level, engineers are expected to make autonomous technical decisions on system design, lead performance-critical projects, and mentor junior engineers — all within a nanosecond-sensitive environment where every architectural choice has measurable P&L impact. The structurally tight labor market for engineers who combine deep systems expertise with financial domain knowledge creates extraordinary leverage for candidates at this level. Citadel Securities, Jane Street, and Jump Trading engage in aggressive bidding wars for senior talent, and the all-cash compensation structure means candidates see the full value of their package immediately — no four-year vesting cliffs, no stock price risk.

#### $8.4B Revenue Engine — The Liquidity Guardian Premium

Citadel Securities generated $8.4 billion in revenue and delivered a $5 billion investor payout. Senior Software Engineers are the load-bearing pillars of this revenue engine. They design the matching engines, optimize the order routing systems, and architect the risk management infrastructure that allows Citadel Securities to safely provide liquidity across 25% of all US equity volume.

At the senior level, the Liquidity Guardian Premium intensifies. These engineers don't just write code — they make architectural decisions that determine whether the firm can capture or lose millions in daily spread. A single latency optimization by a senior engineer can translate into tens of millions in annualized revenue capture. The scarcity of engineers who can operate at this intersection of systems programming, distributed systems, and market microstructure is acute. Citadel Securities estimates that fewer than 2,000 engineers globally possess the specific combination of skills required for their most critical systems.

The $8.4B revenue figure is not abstract — it is the direct output of the systems these senior engineers build and maintain. When Ken Griffin's Citadel LLC (hedge fund) and Citadel Securities (market maker) both compete for the same senior talent, the resulting compensation reflects a market where demand structurally exceeds supply.

#### Global Levers

1. **System Ownership Premium:** "I would be owning critical subsystems within your market-making infrastructure — systems that directly enable your $8.4B revenue. The P&L attribution of these systems justifies a base of $275K+ and a performance bonus that reflects my direct revenue contribution, targeting $350K+ in bonus for a $625K+ total package."

2. **Competing Offer Stack:** "I'm currently holding offers from Jane Street at $550K TC and Two Sigma at $500K TC. Both are all-cash structures. Given Citadel Securities' position as the largest market maker and the scope of the systems I'd own, I'd expect to be at or above the top of this range — $625K minimum total compensation."

3. **Guaranteed Bonus Floor:** "Given the discretionary nature of Citadel Securities' bonus structure, I need a first-year guaranteed bonus of $275K minimum. With $8.4B in revenue and a $5B payout, the firm clearly has the capacity to honor this guarantee, and it de-risks my transition from my current role."

4. **London Parity Lever:** "I understand that London compensation can lag US offices. However, I'm evaluating London-based roles at Jane Street and Millennium that offer GBP packages equivalent to $600K+. To secure my commitment to Citadel Securities London, I'd need parity — £200K base and £280K+ bonus for a total package of £480K+."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $285K base and $325K bonus ($610K TC). Present competing offers from Jane Street ($550K-$650K TC) and Jump Trading ($500K-$575K TC) as your baseline. Demand a first-year guaranteed bonus of at least $275K — this is non-negotiable given the discretionary bonus risk. Push for a sign-on bonus of $75K-$125K if the firm cannot meet your base target. Emphasize the direct P&L impact of the systems you'd own and the $8.4B revenue context. **Accept at $250K+ base and $275K+ bonus ($525K+ TC).** Walk away below $235K base — at that point, senior roles at Jane Street or even Staff-level Big Tech roles with RSU upside become superior on a risk-adjusted basis.
