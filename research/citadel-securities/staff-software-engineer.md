#### Negotiation DNA

Staff Software Engineers at Citadel Securities are the apex Liquidity Guardians on the individual contributor track. They architect the foundational systems — matching engines, risk platforms, order management systems, and real-time data pipelines — that enable Citadel Securities to operate as the world's largest market maker. At this level, the engineer's sphere of influence extends across multiple teams and business lines. They define technical standards, drive multi-quarter platform initiatives, and make decisions that directly shape the firm's competitive position in market-making.

The +15-25% Premium over senior roles reflects a simple economic reality: Staff-level engineers at Citadel Securities are effectively irreplaceable. The intersection of deep systems expertise, financial domain mastery, and the ability to lead without authority in a high-pressure trading environment is extraordinarily rare. The structurally tight labor market at this tier means Citadel Securities often competes with principal-level offers from Jane Street and senior architect roles at Jump Trading. Ken Griffin's dual-entity structure (Citadel LLC hedge fund and Citadel Securities market maker) creates additional internal demand that further compresses the available talent pool.

#### $8.4B Revenue Engine — The Liquidity Guardian Premium

Citadel Securities generated $8.4 billion in revenue and delivered a $5 billion investor payout. Staff Software Engineers are the architects of this revenue engine. They don't just build systems — they design the systems that other engineers build. Their architectural decisions cascade across the entire technology organization and directly determine the firm's capacity to provide liquidity at scale.

At the Staff level, the Liquidity Guardian Premium reaches its highest expression on the IC track. A single architectural decision by a Staff engineer — choosing the right matching engine design, optimizing the order routing topology, or redesigning the risk calculation pipeline — can unlock tens or hundreds of millions in annualized revenue. The firm's ability to handle 25% of all US equity volume is not a given; it is an engineering achievement that must be maintained and extended every day, and Staff engineers are the ones who make that possible.

The +15-25% Premium is justified by the direct line between Staff-level architectural work and the $8.4B top line. When Citadel Securities enters a new asset class or geography, it is Staff engineers who design the systems that make it possible. When regulatory requirements change, it is Staff engineers who ensure the platform adapts without sacrificing latency or reliability. The $5B investor payout is, in very real terms, a payout enabled by the decisions these engineers make.

#### Global Levers

1. **Architectural Impact Quantification:** "The systems I would architect directly enable your market-making operations across US equities — 25% of all volume. At the Staff level, my architectural decisions would have measurable P&L impact in the hundreds of millions annually. I'm targeting $375K base and $500K+ bonus to reflect this direct revenue attribution — a $875K+ total package."

2. **Principal-Level Competing Offers:** "I hold a competing offer from Jane Street at the Principal level — $850K total compensation, all cash. I also have a Staff offer from Two Sigma at $725K TC. To move to Citadel Securities, I need to see the +15-25% Premium reflected in the package — $900K+ total compensation minimum."

3. **Multi-Year Guaranteed Structure:** "Given the discretionary nature of the bonus and the significance of this career decision, I need a two-year guaranteed bonus structure: Year 1 guaranteed at $450K, Year 2 guaranteed at $400K. With $8.4B in revenue, this represents a trivial cost relative to the architectural value I'd deliver."

4. **Dual-Entity Leverage:** "I understand that both Citadel LLC and Citadel Securities draw from the same senior talent pool. I've been approached by the hedge fund side for a quantitative development role at $950K+ TC. To commit to the market-making side, I need the compensation to be competitive — $350K+ base and $475K+ bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $375K base and $500K bonus ($875K TC). Stack competing offers: Jane Street Principal ($800K-$950K TC), Jump Trading Principal ($750K-$850K TC), and Two Sigma Staff ($650K-$775K TC). Demand a two-year guaranteed bonus: Year 1 at $450K minimum, Year 2 at $400K minimum. Push for a sign-on bonus of $100K-$200K to offset any deferred compensation from current employer. Emphasize the +15-25% Premium and the architectural scope of the role. **Accept at $325K+ base and $400K+ bonus ($725K+ TC).** Walk away below $300K base — at that level, the package fails to reflect the Staff-level premium and competing offers become strictly superior.
