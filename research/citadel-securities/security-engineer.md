| Region | Base Salary | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Chicago (HQ) | $190K - $250K | $175K - $275K | $365K - $525K |

#### Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at Citadel Securities are Liquidity Guardians who defend the technology infrastructure that the global financial system depends on. This is not a typical security role — a breach or compromise at Citadel Securities would not just impact one company but could disrupt 25% of all US equity trading, with systemic implications for market stability. Security Engineers design and implement defense-in-depth strategies for trading systems, protect proprietary algorithms and strategies, ensure compliance with SEC and FINRA cybersecurity requirements, and operate in an environment where threat actors include sophisticated nation-state adversaries targeting financial infrastructure.

The structurally tight labor market for security engineers who understand both cybersecurity and financial system architecture creates significant leverage. Citadel Securities competes with Jane Street, Two Sigma, and Jump Trading — as well as with Big Tech security organizations — for professionals who can protect mission-critical financial infrastructure. The all-cash compensation structure provides immediate value realization and eliminates RSU volatility risk.

#### $8.4B Revenue Engine — The Liquidity Guardian Premium

Citadel Securities generated $8.4 billion in revenue and delivered a $5 billion investor payout. Security Engineers are the protective shield of this revenue engine. The $8.4B exists because the firm's systems operate securely — a security breach could result in proprietary strategy theft, trading disruption, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage that would threaten the firm's market position.

The Liquidity Guardian Premium for Security Engineers reflects the catastrophic downside risk they mitigate. While engineers and researchers generate revenue, Security Engineers protect it. The asymmetric risk profile — where a single breach could cost billions in direct losses, regulatory fines, and market confidence — means that the firm's investment in security talent is effectively an insurance premium on the entire $8.4B revenue base.

Handling 25% of all US equity volume makes Citadel Securities a high-value target for threat actors. The firm's proprietary trading algorithms, market-making strategies, and execution infrastructure represent some of the most valuable intellectual property in global finance. Security Engineers who can protect this IP while enabling the performance and speed that market-making demands are exceptionally rare. Ken Griffin's dual entities — Citadel LLC (hedge fund) and Citadel Securities (market maker) — both require sophisticated security programs, creating compound demand for security talent.

#### Global Levers

1. **Systemic Risk Protection Value:** "I would be protecting infrastructure that handles 25% of all US equity volume — a position of systemic importance. A security incident at Citadel Securities would have market-wide implications. This systemic protection value commands compensation well above standard security roles. I'm targeting $240K base and $240K+ bonus for a $480K total package."

2. **Competing Security Offers:** "I have a competing offer from a FAANG security team at $400K TC with RSUs and an offer from a Tier 1 hedge fund at $425K TC. Given the higher stakes and target profile of Citadel Securities' market-making infrastructure, I'd need $475K+ total compensation."

3. **Clearance and Compliance Premium:** "My experience with SEC/FINRA cybersecurity compliance, SOC 2, and financial services regulatory frameworks is directly applicable. This regulatory security expertise is scarce and commands a premium — $235K+ base reflecting the specialized knowledge."

4. **Guaranteed Bonus with Incident Response SLA:** "I need a first-year guaranteed bonus of $215K. Additionally, given the 24/7 nature of security operations and the expectation of incident response availability, I'd expect structured on-call compensation or a security operations premium of $15K-$25K on top of base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $245K base and $245K bonus ($490K TC). Present competing offers from Big Tech security ($375K-$425K TC with RSUs) and competing financial firms ($400K-$450K TC). Push for a first-year guaranteed bonus of at least $215K given the discretionary model. Request a sign-on bonus of $50K-$75K and structured on-call compensation. Emphasize the systemic importance of protecting the $8.4B revenue engine and 25% of US equity volume. **Accept at $210K+ base and $195K+ bonus ($405K+ TC).** Walk away below $195K base — at that level, Big Tech security roles offer comparable total comp with less operational intensity and lower personal liability.
