#### Compensation Overview

Citadel Securities compensates entirely in cash — there is no public equity component. Total compensation consists of Base Salary plus a Performance Bonus. Product Designers at Citadel Securities design the interfaces through which traders, quants, and operations teams interact with market-making systems — every pixel has P&L implications.

#### Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at Citadel Securities are Liquidity Guardians who design the visual and interaction layer of the firm's market-making infrastructure. This is not consumer UX — it is mission-critical interface design where a poorly placed button, a confusing visualization, or a millisecond of unnecessary cognitive load can cost the firm millions. Designers at Citadel Securities create dashboards for real-time risk monitoring, order management interfaces, and analytics tools that traders use to make split-second decisions across 25% of all US equity volume.

The structurally tight labor market for designers who understand financial markets creates genuine leverage. Very few UX/product designers have experience designing for high-frequency trading environments, and Citadel Securities must compete with fintech companies, Big Tech design teams, and other market makers to attract talent capable of designing under the unique constraints of real-time financial systems. The all-cash compensation means designers see the full value of their package from day one.

#### $8.4B Revenue Engine — The Liquidity Guardian Premium

Citadel Securities generated $8.4 billion in revenue and delivered a $5 billion investor payout. Product Designers are the human-system interface layer of this revenue engine. The $8.4B flows through systems that traders interact with via interfaces designed by this team — risk dashboards, order entry tools, position monitors, and execution quality analytics.

The Liquidity Guardian Premium for designers exists because of the cognitive leverage their work creates. A well-designed trading interface enables a trader to process more information, make faster decisions, and manage more positions simultaneously — all of which translate directly to revenue capture. Conversely, a design flaw in a risk monitoring dashboard could delay a trader's response to adverse market conditions, resulting in significant losses.

Citadel Securities handles 25% of all US equity volume, and every share is traded through interfaces that Product Designers create and maintain. The $8.4B revenue figure is not abstract — it is the output of a human-machine system where design quality directly impacts the machine's effectiveness. Ken Griffin's Citadel LLC (hedge fund) and Citadel Securities (market maker) both invest in design talent, creating dual demand in an already constrained market.

#### Global Levers

1. **Cognitive Leverage Argument:** "The trading interfaces I design directly impact how efficiently your traders can operate. Better design means faster decisions, fewer errors, and more capacity — all of which translate to revenue. With $8.4B flowing through these interfaces, I'm targeting $180K base and $175K bonus for a $355K total package."

2. **Fintech Design Scarcity:** "Designers who understand both modern design systems and financial market workflows are extremely rare. My experience designing real-time trading dashboards at [competitor] is directly applicable. My competing offer from a top fintech is $300K TC — I'd need $335K+ from Citadel Securities to make the move."

3. **Guaranteed Bonus Protection:** "I'm coming from a role with predictable compensation. Given Citadel Securities' discretionary bonus structure, I need a first-year guaranteed bonus of $150K minimum. With the firm's $8.4B revenue performance, this guarantee is well within the firm's capacity."

4. **Design System Ownership Premium:** "If I'm building the foundational design system that all trading interfaces will use — a platform-level contribution — that scope commands a premium beyond a single-product designer role. I'd expect $190K+ base and $185K+ bonus for this architectural design responsibility."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Enter negotiations anchored at $185K base and $180K bonus ($365K TC). Reference competing design offers from fintech firms ($275K-$325K TC) and any available data from Jane Street ($300K-$375K TC). Push for a first-year guaranteed bonus of $150K minimum. If the firm counters below $165K base, request a sign-on bonus of $35K-$50K. Emphasize the mission-critical nature of trading interface design and the direct link to the $8.4B revenue engine. **Accept at $160K+ base and $140K+ bonus ($300K+ TC).** Walk away below $150K base — at that level, senior design roles at Big Tech offer competitive total comp with lower intensity expectations.
