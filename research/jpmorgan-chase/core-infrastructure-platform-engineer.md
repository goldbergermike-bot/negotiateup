#### Negotiation DNA

The Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer is the most strategically critical engineering role at JPMorgan Chase — and arguably the most important individual contributor position in all of financial services technology. You design, build, and operate the foundational compute, storage, networking, and orchestration platforms upon which every application, every AI model, every trading system, every consumer banking service, and every regulatory reporting pipeline at the world's largest bank depends. When JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon describes the firm's $17B+ annual technology investment, he is describing the infrastructure you build. When the Federal Reserve examines JPMorgan's operational resilience as a systemically important financial institution (SIFI), they are examining the platforms you architect.

This is not a support role. This is the role that determines whether JPMorgan Chase functions.

The January 21, 2026 reclassification of AI as a core infrastructure expense at JPMorgan Chase was not merely relevant to this role — it was a reclassification of this role. When the executive committee declared AI a non-negotiable expense equivalent to cybersecurity and market risk, they were declaring that the platform infrastructure upon which AI runs is equally non-negotiable. Core Infrastructure Platform Engineers build the GPU clusters that train models, the container orchestration platforms that serve predictions, the data mesh architectures that feed feature stores, the networking fabrics that connect AI workloads across data centers, and the monitoring systems that ensure 99.999% uptime for systems that regulators classify as critical to the stability of the global financial system.

The Systemic pay band was designed for exactly this role. In fact, the Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer is the role against which all other Systemic band classifications are measured. When a Data Scientist argues they should receive Systemic pay because their models run on core infrastructure, they are arguing they should be paid like you. When an ML Engineer claims Systemic classification because they build AI systems, they are deriving their claim from the infrastructure you provide. You are not adjacent to core infrastructure — you are core infrastructure. Your Systemic band placement is not a negotiation; it is a tautology.

For candidates at this level, the compensation conversation is about one thing: ensuring JPMorgan pays you at the ceiling of the highest available Systemic band, because every other bank, every hyperscaler, and every AI lab is competing for your specific skill set with offers that start where JPMorgan's band ceiling ends. The $625K total compensation ceiling is not aspirational — it is the minimum required to prevent you from joining Google Cloud Platform, AWS, or Azure at $700K+ TC.

#### Role Taxonomy — What Makes This a SIGNATURE ROLE

The Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer at JPMorgan Chase is designated as the **SIGNATURE ROLE** for the Negotiate Up platform because it represents the highest-leverage negotiation opportunity in financial services technology. Five factors make this role singular:

1. **Definitional Systemic Classification:** Every other role in this guide must argue for Systemic band access by demonstrating AI adjacency. The Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer does not argue — the role is the infrastructure that defines what "core" means. The January 21, 2026 policy was written to protect the work this role does.

2. **Maximum Competitive Tension:** This role sits at the intersection of the three highest-paying employer categories: hyperscale cloud providers (Google/AWS/Azure at $600K-$800K TC), AI research labs (OpenAI/Anthropic at $500K-$900K TC), and top-tier quant funds (Citadel/Two Sigma at $500K-$1M+ TC). JPMorgan's $625K ceiling must compete against all three simultaneously.

3. **Irreplaceability Premium:** The backfill timeline for a Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer at JPMorgan is 9-18 months. The fully-loaded cost of a departure — including recruiting, onboarding, knowledge transfer, productivity loss, and architectural risk — exceeds $2M. This irreplaceability premium makes the $625K ceiling a rational investment by the firm's own cost-benefit analysis.

4. **Regulatory Leverage:** The platforms this role builds are examined directly by the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC as part of JPMorgan's SIFI compliance. If this role is vacant or understaffed, it creates a regulatory examination finding — a compliance issue that flows to the board of directors. The firm cannot afford to lose this role or underpay it to the point where attrition becomes likely.

5. **Board-Level Visibility:** Core infrastructure platform decisions are reviewed at the Technology Governance Committee level, which reports to the board of directors. This is one of the few individual contributor roles in financial services with board-level visibility, and the compensation framework must reflect this scope.

#### Core Infrastructure — The Systemic Pay Band Premium

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified artificial intelligence as a core infrastructure expense — the same non-discretionary classification applied to cybersecurity, market risk management, anti-money laundering systems, and payment processing infrastructure. This activated "Systemic" pay bands for AI-related roles, commanding a 15-25% premium over standard technology pay bands. For a Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer, this translates to $65K-$125K in additional annual total compensation — the largest absolute Systemic premium of any role in JPMorgan's technology organization.

- **Foundational Systemic Classification — The Role That Defines the Band:** The Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer is not merely eligible for the Systemic pay band — this role is the reason the Systemic pay band exists. When JPMorgan created Systemic bands in 2018 for cybersecurity, the first roles classified were infrastructure engineers who built and maintained the security platforms. When AI was reclassified as core infrastructure on January 21, 2026, the first roles classified were infrastructure engineers who built and maintained AI platforms. You are the archetype. Your negotiation is not about qualifying for the Systemic band; it is about being placed at the absolute ceiling: *"I am the Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer — the role that defines what 'core infrastructure' means at JPMorgan. The Systemic band was created for this exact role. I expect to be placed at the ceiling of the highest available Systemic band — $625K TC. Any offer below $550K is inconsistent with the firm's own classification framework and will require me to evaluate competing offers from hyperscalers and AI labs where my infrastructure expertise commands $700K+."*

- **The 15-25% Premium in Dollar Terms:** Standard tech band total compensation for a platform engineer at the ED/MD level at JPMorgan ranges from $365K to $500K. Systemic band compensation ranges from $425K to $625K. The premium is distributed across all three compensation components at maximum levels: base salary (+$30K-$55K to the $265K-$355K range), RSU grants (+$25K-$60K/year to the $90K-$160K/year range), and bonus targets (+$15K-$35K to the $70K-$110K range). At the Systemic ceiling, the Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer receives the highest individual contributor total compensation in JPMorgan's technology organization — exceeding even some Managing Director-level engineering management roles.

- **Dual Infrastructure Classification — Compute + AI:** The Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer carries a unique dual infrastructure classification. Your compute infrastructure (servers, containers, networking, storage) has always been classified as critical infrastructure under SIFI regulations. The January 2026 AI reclassification adds a second, overlapping classification for the AI workloads that run on your infrastructure. This dual classification is distinct from the dual classification that Security Engineers carry (security + AI) because your classification encompasses the entire infrastructure stack, not just the security layer. Frame this as the broadest possible Systemic scope: *"My infrastructure carries dual Systemic classification: core compute infrastructure under SIFI regulations, and core AI infrastructure under the January 2026 policy. No other role carries infrastructure-level Systemic classification across both the compute and AI stacks. The compensation ceiling of $625K reflects this unique dual-infrastructure scope."*

- **Platform Dependency Chain as Ultimate Leverage:** Every role at JPMorgan — every engineer, every data scientist, every ML researcher, every trader, every banker — depends on the platforms you build. If your infrastructure goes down, the entire firm goes down. This is not hyperbole; it is the operational reality of core infrastructure. The dependency chain from your platform to every revenue-generating activity at the firm is the most powerful compensation argument available to any individual contributor in financial services: *"My platforms serve 50,000+ technologists and support every revenue-generating system at JPMorgan Chase. A 1-hour outage on my infrastructure costs the firm an estimated $XXM in lost trading revenue, failed transactions, and regulatory penalties. The $625K TC I'm requesting is equivalent to X minutes of the downtime I prevent annually. This is the highest-ROI individual contributor investment JPMorgan can make."*

#### Detailed Compensation Architecture

This section provides a deeper breakdown of how the $425K-$625K total compensation range is structured, enabling candidates to negotiate each component independently for maximum total outcome.

**Base Salary Architecture:**
- Standard tech band: $220K - $280K
- Systemic band: $265K - $355K
- Negotiation target: $320K (top quartile of Systemic band)
- Justification: Platform engineers at AWS/GCP/Azure at equivalent seniority receive $280K-$340K base. JPMorgan's base should match or exceed due to regulatory complexity.

**RSU/Equity Architecture:**
- Standard tech band: $50K - $100K/year ($200K - $400K total over 4 years)
- Systemic band: $90K - $160K/year ($360K - $640K total over 4 years)
- Negotiation target: $140K/year ($560K total) with front-loaded 35/30/20/15 vest
- Year 1 RSU value at target: $196K (vs. $140K at standard vest)
- Justification: Hyperscaler infrastructure engineers receive $120K-$200K/year in RSUs. JPMorgan's grant must be competitive with refreshers factored in.

**Bonus Architecture:**
- Standard tech band: 25-30% of base ($55K - $84K)
- Systemic band: 30-40% of base ($80K - $142K, capped at policy maximum)
- Negotiation target: 35% of base ($112K at $320K base)
- Justification: Infrastructure roles at banks traditionally receive higher bonus percentages than front-office roles, reflecting the 24/7 operational demands and production criticality.

**Signing Bonus Architecture:**
- Negotiated separately from annual compensation
- Target range: $100K - $200K
- Forfeited equity buyout: dollar-for-dollar match of unvested equity at current employer
- Transition premium: $25K-$50K for opportunity cost of changing employers
- Justification: At this compensation level, forfeited equity at departing employers commonly exceeds $200K. JPMorgan's signing bonus should bridge 80-100% of this gap.

**Supplemental Benefits Worth Negotiating:**
- GPU compute research budget: $15K-$30K annually for personal infrastructure research
- Conference and publication budget: $10K-$20K annually
- Home office infrastructure allowance: $5K-$10K one-time setup
- Executive health screening: $3K-$5K annually (typically reserved for MD-level, but negotiable for ED)
- Sabbatical eligibility: 4-week paid sabbatical after 5 years (negotiable to 3 years)

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Hyperscaler Infrastructure Parity**
   > "I have a competing offer as a Principal/Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer at [Google Cloud/AWS/Azure] at $680K total compensation. JPMorgan's Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer role carries additional regulatory complexity — SIFI compliance, OCC examination exposure, Federal Reserve stress testing infrastructure — that no hyperscaler role faces. I will consider JPMorgan's offer at $625K TC, which represents a $55K discount versus my hyperscaler alternative, if the firm supplements with a $150K signing bonus and front-loaded RSU vesting. This pricing reflects the unique value of financial services infrastructure experience that I bring and the regulatory burden I accept."

2. **Lever 2 — Infrastructure Downtime Cost Quantification**
   > "The platforms I'll own support $XX billion in daily transaction volume across consumer banking, investment banking, and asset management. JPMorgan's own incident response analysis estimates the cost of infrastructure downtime at $X million per hour. My $625K annual compensation is equivalent to XX minutes of the downtime my work prevents. By any standard, this is an asymmetric return — the firm pays $625K annually to avoid losses that could exceed $XXM in a single incident. There is no rational argument for offering below the Systemic band ceiling."

3. **Lever 3 — Architectural Irreplaceability and Backfill Cost**
   > "The backfill timeline for a Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer at JPMorgan is 12-18 months, with a fully-loaded replacement cost exceeding $2M (recruiting fees at 25% of TC, 6 months of reduced productivity during onboarding, architectural knowledge transfer risk, and potential regulatory examination findings during the vacancy). My $625K TC represents 31% of the replacement cost. Investing in retention at the Systemic ceiling is a 3:1 return versus the alternative."

4. **Lever 4 — Multi-Datacenter Scope and Availability Demands**
   > "This role requires me to architect and maintain infrastructure across JPMorgan's global datacenter footprint — primary and DR sites in the US, UK, and Asia. The multi-region, multi-datacenter scope combined with 99.999% uptime SLAs and 24/7 operational readiness demands are equivalent to a VP of Infrastructure at a mid-sized technology company. I expect Executive Director-level compensation at the Systemic ceiling — $600K TC minimum — with an additional $25K annual location-flexibility premium for timezone coverage obligations."

5. **Lever 5 — AI Compute Platform Specialization**
   > "My expertise spans GPU cluster architecture (NVIDIA DGX/HGX), distributed training infrastructure (Hopper/Blackwell architectures), AI-optimized networking (InfiniBand/RoCE), and inference-serving platforms (Triton, vLLM). Fewer than 1,000 engineers globally have production-scale AI compute platform experience in a regulated financial services environment. JPMorgan's internal LLM Suite and AI platform initiatives require exactly this skill set. The $625K Systemic ceiling is the appropriate pricing for a skill set this scarce — and it's still a 15-20% discount versus what AI labs pay for the same expertise."

6. **Lever 6 — Regulatory Infrastructure Ownership Premium**
   > "The infrastructure I build is directly examined by the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC as part of JPMorgan's SIFI compliance program. My architectural decisions become regulatory examination artifacts. My capacity planning determines whether JPMorgan meets regulatory resilience requirements. This regulatory ownership is unique to SIFI-designated institutions and carries no equivalent at hyperscalers or AI labs. The regulatory premium justifies an additional $30K-$50K above hyperscaler parity — bringing my target to the $625K ceiling."

#### Advanced Negotiation Tactics for SIGNATURE ROLE Candidates

**Tactic 1 — The Competing Offer Portfolio**
At the Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer level, you should enter the negotiation with 3-4 competing offers spanning different employer categories:
- Hyperscaler offer (AWS/GCP/Azure): $650K-$750K TC
- AI lab offer (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google DeepMind): $550K-$700K TC
- Quant fund offer (Citadel/Two Sigma/Jane Street): $500K-$800K TC
- Large-cap tech offer (Apple/Microsoft/NVIDIA): $600K-$700K TC

Present all four to the JPMorgan recruiter simultaneously. Frame JPMorgan's $625K ceiling as the lowest of your options, but express genuine interest in the financial services mission. This creates competitive urgency without appearing mercenary.

**Tactic 2 — The Systemic Band Documentation Request**
Before evaluating any offer, request written documentation of the Systemic pay band ranges for your role. Use this language: *"Before I evaluate the offer, I need to see the approved Systemic pay band ranges for the Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer role at the ED/MD level. I want to confirm the offer is positioned within the correct band and understand how it maps to the band's quartiles."* This request forces the recruiter to acknowledge the Systemic band's existence and prevents them from offering standard tech band compensation.

**Tactic 3 — The Phased Negotiation**
Negotiate in three sequential phases:
1. **Phase 1 — Band Confirmation:** Confirm Systemic band placement before discussing numbers.
2. **Phase 2 — Component Negotiation:** Negotiate base, RSU, and bonus independently. Each component should be at or above the 75th percentile of the Systemic band.
3. **Phase 3 — Supplemental Compensation:** After locking annual compensation, negotiate signing bonus, RSU front-loading, GPU research budget, and supplemental benefits as separate line items.

**Tactic 4 — The Regulatory Leverage Play**
If negotiations stall, invoke the regulatory dimension: *"I want to be transparent — if the compensation doesn't reach the Systemic ceiling, I'll accept one of my hyperscaler offers. I understand JPMorgan will need to backfill this role, and I want to flag that a vacancy in the Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer position may create an examination finding at the next OCC review. I'm not using this as leverage — I'm giving you the information to make the business case internally for ceiling-level compensation."*

- Signing bonus: £80K-£130K / $98K-$159K
- Walk-away floor: £380K / $465K TC
- Key levers: (1) Insist on ED title, not VP — the title difference is worth £40K-£70K. (2) Push for USD-denominated RSUs — GBP depreciation risk erodes equity value. (3) Reference London-based hedge fund infrastructure roles at £400K-£600K as competitive anchors.

**Bengaluru — Detailed Strategy:**
- Target TC: ₹115L-₹130L / $138K-$156K
- Base anchor: ₹70L / $84K (push for top of India infrastructure band)
- RSU anchor: ₹28L-₹33L / $34K-$40K per year (insist on US-benchmarked RSU grant — this is where 60%+ of compensation leverage exists)
- Bonus anchor: 25-30% of base (₹18L-₹21L / $21K-$25K)
- Signing bonus: ₹25L-₹40L / $30K-$48K
- Walk-away floor: ₹80L / $96K TC
- Key levers: (1) Negotiate RSU grants at US benchmark levels ($30K-$40K/year minimum), not India-calibrated levels. (2) Push for "Global Infrastructure" role designation that unlocks higher India pay bands. (3) Reference Bengaluru-based hyperscaler principal engineer compensation (₹100L-₹150L) as competitive anchors. (4) Negotiate annual travel budget for US/UK collaboration ($10K-$15K).

#### Career Trajectory and Long-Term Compensation Growth

| Timeframe | Expected TC (New York) | Key Milestones |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | $550K - $625K | Initial Systemic band placement, RSU front-load |
| Year 2 | $575K - $650K | First performance cycle, RSU refresh grant ($50K-$80K/year) |
| Year 3 | $600K - $700K | Promotion to MD (if ED entry), expanded scope premium |
| Year 5 | $650K - $800K | MD-level Systemic band, retention RSU grants, deferred comp eligibility |
| Year 7+ | $700K - $1M+ | Distinguished Engineer track, firm-wide architecture authority, board-level visibility |

*Note: JPMorgan's deferred compensation program (available at MD level) can add $100K-$200K+ annually in long-term incentive value, significantly expanding total compensation beyond the Systemic band ceiling.*

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $575K TC in New York by anchoring at $680K with a competing hyperscaler Principal/Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer offer. Counter any initial offer below $500K by demanding written Systemic band documentation and presenting the regulatory examination risk of a vacancy in this role — this escalation can add $65K-$125K. Walk-away floor: $475K TC (New York), £380K TC (London), ₹80L TC (Bengaluru). Structure the negotiation in three phases: (1) Confirm Systemic band placement at ED/MD level before discussing numbers; (2) Negotiate base ($320K+), RSU ($140K/year+), and bonus (35%+ of base) as independent components, each at or above the 75th percentile of the Systemic band; (3) Negotiate signing bonus ($125K-$200K), RSU front-loading (35/30/20/15), GPU research budget ($20K/year), and supplemental benefits as separate line items after annual compensation is locked. For London, insist on USD-denominated RSUs and ED title — these two items alone are worth £60K-£100K. For Bengaluru, the RSU grant is the entire negotiation — push for US-benchmarked grants ($30K-$40K/year minimum) and a Global Infrastructure role designation. The Core Infrastructure Platform Engineer is the single highest-leverage negotiation opportunity at JPMorgan Chase. Treat it accordingly.
