#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at JPMorgan Chase own the infrastructure that makes the entire $17B technology operation run. You manage the CI/CD pipelines that deploy code across thousands of production systems, the container orchestration platforms that host mission-critical applications, the monitoring and observability stacks that detect incidents before they become outages, and the cloud infrastructure that supports JPMorgan's hybrid multi-cloud strategy. Every deployment you manage touches systems that process trillions of dollars in daily financial transactions — a failed deployment on your watch can trigger regulatory reporting obligations and market-moving headlines.

The January 21, 2026 reclassification of AI as a core infrastructure expense at JPMorgan Chase directly elevates the DevOps Engineer role. AI workloads are the most infrastructure-intensive workloads in the firm — they require GPU clusters, specialized compute environments, high-bandwidth data pipelines, and real-time model-serving infrastructure that operates at 99.99%+ uptime. The DevOps engineers who provision, deploy, monitor, and maintain this AI infrastructure are now custodians of a core expense category. When JPMorgan declared AI non-negotiable, it implicitly declared the infrastructure engineers who keep AI running as non-negotiable as well.

For DevOps candidates, the negotiation opportunity lies in the gap between how the market traditionally prices DevOps roles (as support/operations functions) and how JPMorgan's January 2026 policy actually classifies AI infrastructure operations (as core, non-discretionary, Systemic). Bridge this gap, and you access the 15-25% Systemic pay band premium.

#### Core Infrastructure — The Systemic Pay Band Premium

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified artificial intelligence as a core infrastructure expense, placing it in the same non-discretionary budget category as cybersecurity and market risk. This activated "Systemic" pay bands for AI-related roles, commanding a 15-25% premium over standard technology pay bands. For a DevOps Engineer, this translates to $30K-$50K in additional annual total compensation.

- **Historical Precedent — Security Operations Parity:** Systemic pay bands were created in 2018 when cybersecurity operations engineers — the people who maintained security infrastructure — saw immediate 18-20% compensation lifts. DevOps engineers maintaining AI infrastructure are the direct operational analog. The infrastructure you manage (GPU clusters, model-serving platforms, AI data pipelines) is now classified identically to the security infrastructure that triggered Systemic bands. Your pitch: *"I'll maintain the AI infrastructure that JPMorgan classified as core expense on January 21, 2026. Security operations engineers maintaining cyber infrastructure under Systemic bands earn $260K+ TC. My AI infrastructure operations role warrants the same classification — $270K TC."*

- **The 15-25% Premium in Dollar Terms:** Standard tech band total compensation for a DevOps Engineer at JPMorgan ranges from $195K to $235K. Systemic band compensation ranges from $235K to $278K. The premium is distributed across base salary (+$10K-$15K), RSU grants (+$8K-$15K/year), and bonus targets (+$5K-$12K). DevOps engineers in Systemic bands also qualify for on-call compensation premiums of $10K-$20K annually — a benefit not available in standard tech bands.

- **Uptime SLA as Systemic Qualifier:** AI infrastructure at JPMorgan operates under 99.99%+ uptime SLAs — the same SLA tier applied to core banking and payment processing systems. If the AI infrastructure you manage is held to Systemic uptime standards, the role that maintains that uptime should be classified at Systemic pay levels. Frame it: *"The AI infrastructure I'll manage operates under 99.99% uptime SLAs — the same tier as core banking systems. If the SLA is Systemic, the engineer maintaining that SLA should be compensated at Systemic levels. I need my offer adjusted to the Systemic band — $265K TC minimum."*

- **GPU/Compute Infrastructure Specialization:** DevOps engineers who manage GPU clusters and specialized AI compute infrastructure possess skills that are extremely scarce in financial services. The intersection of GPU cluster management, financial services compliance, and production reliability engineering is occupied by fewer than 2,000 engineers globally. This scarcity alone justifies top-of-band Systemic compensation: *"My experience managing GPU compute infrastructure in regulated environments places me in a candidate pool of fewer than 2,000 globally. The Systemic band ceiling of $278K TC reflects this scarcity premium, and I expect my offer to be calibrated accordingly."*

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Cloud/SRE Big Tech Parity**
   > "I have a competing offer as an SRE/DevOps Engineer at [Google/AWS/Microsoft] at $260K total compensation. JPMorgan's DevOps role carries additional regulatory compliance burden — SOX controls, OCC audit trails, SIFI-mandated disaster recovery — that hyperscaler internal roles don't face. I'm targeting $275K TC — Big Tech parity plus a compliance premium."

2. **Lever 2 — On-Call Criticality Premium**
   > "This role includes 24/7 on-call responsibilities for AI infrastructure serving production trading and consumer banking systems. Each on-call incident carries potential regulatory reporting obligations. I'm requesting a formalized on-call premium of $15K annually in addition to the base compensation package, bringing target TC to $278K."

3. **Lever 3 — Multi-Cloud Specialization**
   > "JPMorgan operates a hybrid multi-cloud environment spanning AWS, Azure, and private cloud. My expertise across all three platforms — including Kubernetes orchestration, Terraform IaC, and cloud-native CI/CD — eliminates the need for three separate specialists. The $270K TC I'm targeting represents a 30% discount versus hiring three cloud-specific engineers at $195K each."

4. **Lever 4 — Infrastructure-as-Code Revenue Enablement**
   > "The deployment pipelines I'll build directly accelerate JPMorgan's time-to-market for AI products. Every day of deployment delay costs the firm an estimated $XXK in deferred revenue. By reducing deployment cycles from weekly to daily, my infrastructure work creates measurable revenue acceleration. A $270K TC investment yields ROI within the first quarter."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $260K TC in New York by anchoring at $290K with a competing Big Tech SRE offer. Counter any initial offer below $230K by requesting Systemic band review for AI infrastructure operations — this can add $30K-$45K. Walk-away floor: $215K TC (New York), £170K TC (London), ₹45L TC (Bengaluru). Negotiate signing bonus separately targeting $30K-$50K. Negotiate on-call premium as a separate compensation component — target $12K-$20K annually. In London, confirm VP-level title for appropriate band access. In Bengaluru, negotiate for US-benchmarked RSU grants ($30K-$50K/year) and push for a formalized on-call premium in addition to base compensation.
