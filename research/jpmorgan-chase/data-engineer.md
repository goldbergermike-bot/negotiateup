#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at JPMorgan Chase build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers every analytical and AI capability across the firm. You design the pipelines that ingest, transform, and deliver petabytes of financial data — transaction records, market data feeds, customer interaction logs, regulatory reporting datasets — to hundreds of downstream consumers including data scientists, ML engineers, business analysts, and regulatory reporting systems. Your pipelines must operate with zero data loss, sub-second latency for real-time feeds, and complete auditability for regulatory compliance. The data infrastructure you build is the foundation upon which JPMorgan's entire $17B technology investment produces value.

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified AI as a core infrastructure expense. For Data Engineers, this reclassification has an immediate and direct impact: AI systems cannot function without the data pipelines that Data Engineers build and maintain. Every ML model requires training data, every real-time prediction requires feature data, every model monitoring system requires performance data — and all of this data flows through the infrastructure you own. When JPMorgan declared AI a core expense, it implicitly declared the data infrastructure that feeds AI a core expense as well. You are not adjacent to AI infrastructure; you are the prerequisite for it.

For Data Engineer candidates, the negotiation strategy is to position your data pipelines as the critical dependency for every AI workload at the firm. Without your infrastructure, the AI systems that JPMorgan classified as core expense cannot operate. This dependency relationship qualifies your role for Systemic pay bands, with the corresponding 15-25% premium.

#### Core Infrastructure — The Systemic Pay Band Premium

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified artificial intelligence as a core infrastructure expense, applying the same non-discretionary budget treatment used for cybersecurity and market risk systems. This activated "Systemic" pay bands for AI-related roles, commanding a 15-25% premium over standard technology pay bands. For a Data Engineer, this translates to $30K-$52K in additional annual total compensation.

- **Historical Precedent — Market Data Infrastructure Parity:** JPMorgan has historically treated market data infrastructure engineers — the people who build the data feeds that trading systems depend on — as Systemic-band employees because trading cannot function without market data. The January 2026 AI reclassification creates identical logic for AI data infrastructure: AI cannot function without the data pipelines you build. Your negotiation opener: *"Market data infrastructure engineers have been in Systemic bands because trading depends on their data feeds. AI systems depend on my data pipelines with the same criticality — especially after the January 21, 2026 reclassification. I expect the same Systemic classification — $275K TC minimum."*

- **The 15-25% Premium in Dollar Terms:** Standard tech band total compensation for a Data Engineer at JPMorgan ranges from $198K to $240K. Systemic band compensation ranges from $240K to $285K. The premium is distributed across base salary (+$10K-$15K), RSU grants (+$8K-$18K/year), and bonus targets (+$7K-$14K). Data Engineers in Systemic bands also gain access to advanced data platform training budgets and cloud certification sponsorship worth $5K-$8K annually.

- **Data Pipeline Dependency as Systemic Qualifier:** The strongest Systemic qualification argument for Data Engineers is the dependency argument — without your data pipelines, AI workloads produce no output. Quantify this: *"I will own data pipelines that serve as the primary data source for XX ML models across JPMorgan. If my pipelines go down, those models — all classified as core infrastructure since January 2026 — produce no predictions. A dependency of this criticality warrants Systemic band placement. I need the offer adjusted to $270K TC."*

- **Data Governance as Regulatory Infrastructure:** Data Engineers at JPMorgan don't just move data; they implement the data governance controls — lineage tracking, quality validation, access controls, PII masking — that regulators require for AI model inputs. This governance work is regulatory infrastructure. Frame it: *"The data governance controls I implement are required by BCBS 239, SR 11-7, and GDPR for AI model inputs. This regulatory data infrastructure is, by definition, core infrastructure under the January 2026 policy. My role qualifies for the Systemic band — $280K TC."*

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Big Tech Data Engineering Parity**
   > "I have a competing offer as a Data Engineer at [Google/Meta/Amazon/Snowflake] at $268K total compensation. JPMorgan's data engineering role requires additional data governance compliance, real-time regulatory reporting pipelines, and Systemic classification under the January 2026 AI core infrastructure policy. I'm targeting $280K TC — Big Tech parity plus the regulatory data infrastructure premium."

2. **Lever 2 — Pipeline Scale Impact**
   > "The data pipelines I'll build will process XX terabytes daily, serving XX downstream consumers including XX ML models classified as core AI infrastructure. At data infrastructure companies like Databricks and Snowflake, data engineers managing pipelines of this scale earn $260K-$310K TC. My $280K target is conservative for the scope."

3. **Lever 3 — Real-Time Streaming Specialization**
   > "This role requires expertise in real-time streaming architectures — Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming — for financial data at millisecond latency. Fewer than 5,000 data engineers globally have real-time streaming experience in regulated financial services environments. I'm requesting a $15K specialization premium on base salary — $175K vs. $160K — reflecting this scarcity."

4. **Lever 4 — Data Platform Modernization ROI**
   > "The data pipeline modernization I'll lead is projected to reduce data processing costs by $X million annually and improve ML model training cycle times by 40%. The $285K TC I'm targeting will pay for itself within the first quarter through infrastructure cost savings alone."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $265K TC in New York by anchoring at $295K with a competing Big Tech or data infrastructure company offer. Counter any initial offer below $235K by requesting Systemic band review using the AI data dependency argument — this can add $30K-$50K. Walk-away floor: $220K TC (New York), £175K TC (London), ₹45L TC (Bengaluru). Negotiate signing bonus separately targeting $30K-$50K. In London, confirm VP-level title and push for Systemic band classification to align with New York compensation framework. In Bengaluru, negotiate for US-benchmarked RSU grants ($30K-$55K/year) and push for formal data platform ownership scope that justifies higher-band placement.
