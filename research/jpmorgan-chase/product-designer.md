#### Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at JPMorgan Chase design the interfaces and experiences through which hundreds of millions of customers interact with the world's largest bank. Your design decisions directly influence transaction volumes, customer acquisition costs, and regulatory compliance — every screen, flow, and interaction must satisfy both user experience standards and federal accessibility, disclosure, and consumer protection requirements. JPMorgan's Chase mobile app alone serves 65+ million active users, making it one of the highest-traffic financial applications in the world. The designers who shape these experiences carry a level of impact that most Big Tech design roles cannot match in terms of financial and regulatory consequence.

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified AI as a core infrastructure expense. For Product Designers, this reclassification is significant because it elevates the design of AI-powered interfaces — conversational banking experiences, AI-driven financial advice tools, predictive dashboards, and intelligent notification systems — to core infrastructure status. If you are designing the user experience layer of any AI-powered product, your role now intersects with Systemic pay band eligibility. The design of an AI interface is not a cosmetic exercise; it is a regulatory touchpoint where model outputs meet consumer-facing disclosures, and where poor design creates compliance risk.

Designers entering JPMorgan should position themselves at this intersection of AI product design and regulatory compliance. The Systemic pay band premium of 15-25% represents the difference between a standard tech design offer at $175K-$200K and a Systemic-classified design role at $215K-$248K.

#### Core Infrastructure — The Systemic Pay Band Premium

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified artificial intelligence as a core infrastructure expense, applying the same non-discretionary budget treatment used for cybersecurity and market risk systems. This activated "Systemic" pay bands for AI-related roles, commanding a 15-25% premium over standard technology pay bands. For a Product Designer, this translates to $30K-$48K in additional annual total compensation.

- **Historical Precedent — Security UX Parity:** When Systemic pay bands were created in 2018, UX designers working on security-critical interfaces — authentication flows, fraud alert systems, secure messaging — saw compensation lifts of 15-18% as their roles were classified as Systemic. The January 2026 AI reclassification extends this to designers building AI-powered interfaces. If you design conversational AI experiences, AI-generated financial insights displays, or any interface where ML model outputs are presented to customers, your role qualifies. Use this framing: *"I'll be designing the consumer-facing interface for AI-generated recommendations — a product JPMorgan classified as core infrastructure on January 21, 2026. Security UX designers under Systemic bands earn $230K+ TC. I expect the same classification for my AI-interface design role."*

- **The 15-25% Premium in Dollar Terms:** Standard tech band total compensation for a Product Designer at JPMorgan ranges from $175K to $210K. Systemic band compensation ranges from $210K to $248K. The premium manifests primarily in RSU grants (+$8K-$15K/year) and bonus targets (+$5K-$10K), with base salary adjustments of $8K-$15K. Design roles in Systemic bands also gain access to higher-tier design tools budgets and conference attendance allowances.

- **AI Interface Compliance as Systemic Qualifier:** Designing AI interfaces in financial services carries unique regulatory requirements — explainability disclosures, model confidence displays, fair lending compliance in AI-driven offers, and CFPB-mandated transparency in automated decisioning. These regulatory design requirements are what qualify AI-focused design roles for Systemic classification. Frame it as: *"The AI interfaces I'll design must comply with CFPB explainability requirements and fair lending disclosures. This regulatory design burden is identical to what security UX designers face under Systemic classification. I need my offer to reflect this — $240K TC minimum."*

- **Design System as Infrastructure:** If your role involves building or maintaining JPMorgan's design system — the component library and design tokens that every product team uses — you have an additional Systemic argument. Design systems are infrastructure by definition. Under the January 2026 framework, any infrastructure that AI products consume is Systemic. Frame it: *"The design system I'll maintain is consumed by every AI-powered product at JPMorgan. It's infrastructure that supports core infrastructure. The Systemic band is the appropriate classification."*

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Big Tech Design Parity**
   > "I have a competing offer as a Product Designer at [Google/Meta/Apple] at $235K total compensation. JPMorgan's design role carries additional regulatory complexity — CFPB compliance, accessibility mandates, financial disclosure requirements — that Big Tech design roles don't face. I'm targeting $245K TC to reflect both market parity and the regulatory premium."

2. **Lever 2 — User Scale Impact**
   > "The Chase mobile app has 65+ million monthly active users. My design decisions will directly impact the user experience for a population larger than most countries. At Big Tech, designers with comparable user-scale impact earn $220K-$280K TC. My $240K target is conservative given the financial transaction context and regulatory exposure of each design decision."

3. **Lever 3 — Design-Engineering Ratio Scarcity**
   > "JPMorgan's designer-to-engineer ratio is approximately 1:15, compared to 1:5 at Big Tech. This means each designer at JPMorgan carries 3x the scope and influence of their Big Tech counterpart. The compensation should reflect this leverage — I'm requesting a $15K base salary increase to $150K to account for the expanded scope per designer."

4. **Lever 4 — Accessibility and Compliance Specialization**
   > "Financial services product design requires ADA/WCAG compliance, CFPB disclosure design, and fair lending visual compliance — specializations that standard tech designers don't possess. Fewer than 1,000 designers globally have this combination of financial services UX and regulatory compliance expertise. The $248K Systemic band ceiling reflects this scarcity premium."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $235K TC in New York by anchoring at $260K with a competing Big Tech design offer. Counter any initial offer below $200K by requesting Systemic band review for AI interface design scope — this can add $30K-$45K. Walk-away floor: $195K TC (New York), £155K TC (London), ₹40L TC (Bengaluru). Negotiate signing bonus separately targeting $25K-$40K. In London, confirm VP-level title to avoid Associate-level pay suppression — VP title is worth £20K-£35K in annual comp. In Bengaluru, push for US-benchmarked RSU grants ($25K-$45K/year) as the primary compensation lever since base salary will be locally calibrated.
