#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at JPMorgan Chase orchestrate the most complex technology initiatives in financial services. You coordinate across 10-30 engineering teams, manage multi-million-dollar program budgets, navigate regulatory timelines that carry financial penalties for missed deadlines, and report program status directly to C-suite executives. Unlike Big Tech TPMs who manage feature launches, JPMorgan TPMs manage programs where delays can trigger regulatory enforcement actions, missed market windows can cost hundreds of millions in revenue, and scope changes must be evaluated against compliance obligations. The operational complexity and stakeholder density of a JPMorgan TPM role exceeds virtually any comparable position in technology.

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified AI as a core infrastructure expense, placing it in the same budgetary category as cybersecurity and risk management. For TPMs, this reclassification is significant because it means AI programs are now subject to the same delivery governance, executive oversight, and regulatory reporting requirements as security and risk programs. The TPM managing an AI infrastructure program is now managing a Systemic program — one where delivery failures have the same consequence profile as security infrastructure delivery failures. This classification elevates the TPM role from standard technology program management to Systemic program management, with the corresponding 15-25% pay band premium.

For TPM candidates, the negotiation strategy is to position yourself as a Systemic program manager — someone who manages programs classified as non-discretionary core infrastructure — rather than as a generic technology program manager. The distinction is worth $30K-$50K in annual total compensation.

#### Core Infrastructure — The Systemic Pay Band Premium

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified artificial intelligence as a core infrastructure expense, placing it alongside cybersecurity and market risk in the firm's non-discretionary budget. This activated "Systemic" pay bands for AI-related roles, commanding a 15-25% premium over standard technology pay bands. For a Technical Program Manager, this translates to $30K-$50K in additional annual total compensation.

- **Historical Precedent — Security Program Management Parity:** When Systemic pay bands were created in 2018, TPMs managing cybersecurity programs saw immediate compensation lifts of 16-20%. Their programs carried regulatory deadlines with financial penalties, required executive steering committee governance, and could not be deprioritized without regulatory approval. AI programs now carry identical governance requirements under the January 2026 policy. Your negotiation opener: *"I'll be managing an AI infrastructure program that JPMorgan classified as core expense on January 21, 2026. Security program managers under Systemic bands earn $280K+ TC. My AI program management role warrants the same classification — $285K TC."*

- **The 15-25% Premium in Dollar Terms:** Standard tech band total compensation for a TPM at JPMorgan ranges from $205K to $250K. Systemic band compensation ranges from $245K to $295K. The premium is concentrated in bonus targets (+$8K-$15K, driven by higher program delivery multipliers) and RSU grants (+$10K-$18K/year), with base salary adjustments of $8K-$15K. TPMs in Systemic bands also receive program budget authority — a formal delegation that enhances scope and influence.

- **Program Budget as Systemic Qualifier:** If the program you manage has a budget classified as core infrastructure expense under the January 2026 policy, your role automatically inherits Systemic classification. AI programs at JPMorgan carry budgets of $10M-$100M+ — all now classified as non-discretionary. Frame it: *"The AI program I'll manage has a $30M annual budget that JPMorgan has classified as core infrastructure expense since January 2026. As the TPM responsible for delivery governance of a core expense program, my role is Systemic by definition. I need the offer adjusted to the Systemic band — $280K TC minimum."*

- **Regulatory Deadline Risk as Premium Driver:** AI programs at JPMorgan operate under regulatory timelines — model validation deadlines, MRM review cycles, and compliance integration milestones. Missing these deadlines carries financial and reputational risk. TPMs who manage programs with regulatory timeline exposure have a clear argument for Systemic classification: *"This program has three regulatory milestones in 2026 with combined penalty exposure of $XXM for missed deadlines. The Systemic band premium of $40K is trivial compared to the regulatory risk I'll be managing. My compensation should reflect this risk-management responsibility — $290K TC."*

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Big Tech TPM Parity**
   > "I have a competing offer as a TPM at [Google/Meta/Amazon] at $280K total compensation. JPMorgan's TPM role carries additional regulatory timeline management, OCC examination preparation, and now Systemic program classification under the AI core infrastructure policy. I'm targeting $295K TC — Big Tech parity plus the regulatory complexity premium."

2. **Lever 2 — Program Budget Scale**
   > "This program has a $40M annual budget with 25 engineering teams across three time zones. At Big Tech, TPMs managing programs of this scale and complexity earn $270K-$330K TC. My $290K target is at the low end of the scale-adjusted range and represents less than 0.75% of the program budget I'll govern."

3. **Lever 3 — Executive Visibility Premium**
   > "This role reports program status to the CTO and presents at quarterly executive steering committee meetings. The executive visibility and governance responsibility are equivalent to a Director-level TPM at Big Tech companies. I'm requesting VP-level Systemic band compensation at $285K TC to reflect the actual scope and stakeholder density."

4. **Lever 4 — Cross-Timezone Coordination Burden**
   > "This program spans engineering teams in New York, London, and Bengaluru, requiring me to maintain operational hours across three time zones. The coordination burden and schedule flexibility demands warrant a $10K location-flexibility premium on top of the Systemic band base — total target of $295K TC."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $275K TC in New York by anchoring at $310K with a competing Big Tech TPM offer. Counter any initial offer below $245K by requesting Systemic band review for AI program management scope — this can add $30K-$45K. Walk-away floor: $230K TC (New York), £185K TC (London), ₹48L TC (Bengaluru). Negotiate signing bonus separately targeting $35K-$55K. In London, push for VP title and confirm the program's Systemic classification carries over to London compensation bands. In Bengaluru, negotiate for US-benchmarked RSU grants ($30K-$55K/year) and a formal program budget authority delegation that justifies higher-band placement.
