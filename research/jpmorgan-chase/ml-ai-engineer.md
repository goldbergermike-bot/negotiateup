#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at JPMorgan Chase are the single most strategically important technical role in the firm's technology organization in 2026. You build, train, deploy, and maintain the machine learning models and AI systems that JPMorgan has classified as core infrastructure — credit risk models that score $1T+ in consumer loans, fraud detection systems that protect billions of daily transactions, trading algorithms that execute across every asset class, and the firm's internal LLM Suite that serves generative AI capabilities to 300,000+ employees. There is no role at JPMorgan with a more direct connection to the AI-as-core-infrastructure thesis than the ML/AI Engineer.

The January 21, 2026 reclassification of AI as a core infrastructure expense was written about you. When JPMorgan's executive committee placed AI in the same budget category as cybersecurity and market risk, they were declaring that the work ML/AI Engineers do is non-negotiable — it cannot be deferred, deprioritized, or staffed with junior substitutes. This is the strongest possible negotiation position because the firm's own policy framework treats your role as essential to the organization's regulatory compliance and competitive viability. The Systemic pay band premium of 15-25% applies to your role by the most direct and literal interpretation of the January 2026 policy.

For ML/AI Engineer candidates, the negotiation is not about whether you qualify for the Systemic band — you qualify automatically by definition. The negotiation is about where within the Systemic band your offer should be placed, and the answer is at the ceiling. JPMorgan is competing for your skills against Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta FAIR, and every quant fund on Wall Street. The $425K TC ceiling of the Systemic band is the minimum needed to remain competitive in this talent market.

#### Core Infrastructure — The Systemic Pay Band Premium

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified artificial intelligence as a core infrastructure expense — the same non-discretionary classification applied to cybersecurity, market risk, and anti-money laundering systems. This activated "Systemic" pay bands for AI-related roles, commanding a 15-25% premium over standard technology pay bands. For an ML/AI Engineer, this translates to $45K-$85K in additional annual total compensation — the largest absolute premium of any role because ML/AI Engineers are the primary builders of the systems this policy protects.

- **Automatic Systemic Classification — No Argument Required:** Unlike other roles that must demonstrate AI adjacency to qualify for Systemic bands, ML/AI Engineers are classified as Systemic by definition under the January 2026 policy. Your primary work output — ML models and AI systems — is the core infrastructure that the policy protects. There is no adjacency argument to make because there is no gap between your work and the classification. Your negotiation opener is simply: *"I build AI systems. JPMorgan classified AI as core infrastructure on January 21, 2026. My role is Systemic by the most literal reading of this policy. I expect the offer to reflect the Systemic band ceiling — $425K TC — without further qualification required."*

- **The 15-25% Premium in Dollar Terms:** Standard tech band total compensation for an ML/AI Engineer at JPMorgan ranges from $285K to $355K. Systemic band compensation ranges from $340K to $425K. The premium is distributed heavily in RSU grants (+$20K-$40K/year) and bonus targets (+$10K-$20K), with base salary adjustments of $15K-$30K. ML/AI Engineers in the Systemic band also receive GPU compute budgets for personal research ($10K-$25K annually) and conference travel/publication support — benefits that help JPMorgan compete with research labs for talent.

- **External Market as Systemic Band Enforcer:** The external market for ML/AI Engineers sets a hard floor that JPMorgan's Systemic band must meet or exceed. Google DeepMind offers $350K-$550K TC. OpenAI offers $400K-$700K TC. Anthropic offers $380K-$600K TC. Quant funds offer $400K-$1M+ TC. JPMorgan's Systemic band ceiling of $425K TC is already at the low end of these competitive ranges. Use this: *"My competing offers from [AI lab/quant fund] are at $450K+ TC. JPMorgan's Systemic band ceiling of $425K is already a discount. I need to be at the absolute ceiling to consider JPMorgan over these alternatives."*

- **Model Risk as Compensation Multiplier:** Every model you build at JPMorgan undergoes MRM (Model Risk Management) review under SR 11-7. The regulatory compliance burden of building models in a SIFI environment — documentation requirements, validation processes, ongoing monitoring obligations — adds 30-50% more work per model compared to an unregulated environment. This compliance burden justifies compensation above and beyond what unregulated AI labs offer: *"I accept the 30-50% MRM compliance overhead that comes with building models in a SIFI environment. This regulatory burden alone justifies the Systemic band ceiling — I'm doing more work per model than my counterpart at Google DeepMind, with higher consequences for model failure."*

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — AI Lab / Quant Fund Dual Anchor**
   > "I have competing offers from [OpenAI/Anthropic/Google DeepMind] at $480K TC and from [Two Sigma/Citadel/DE Shaw] at $520K TC. JPMorgan's $425K Systemic band ceiling is already a $55K-$95K discount versus my alternatives. I'll consider JPMorgan's offer at the Systemic ceiling of $425K TC if the firm can supplement with a $100K signing bonus and front-loaded RSU vesting to close the gap in Year 1."

2. **Lever 2 — Model Revenue/Risk Attribution**
   > "The models I'll build are projected to generate $XXM in incremental revenue (or prevent $XXM in losses) annually. At quant funds, ML engineers earn 1-3% of the alpha they generate. Even at 0.1% of value attribution, my compensation should exceed $400K TC. The $425K target is a fraction of the economic value my models will create."

3. **Lever 3 — PhD / Research Publication Premium**
   > "My PhD in [ML/CS/Statistics] and XX published papers at [NeurIPS/ICML/AAAI] represent a research profile that AI labs compensate at $450K+ TC. JPMorgan benefits from this research credibility when recruiting other ML talent and when publishing applied research to maintain the firm's reputation as a technology leader. I'm requesting a $25K research premium on base — $250K vs. $225K."

4. **Lever 4 — LLM/Foundation Model Specialization**
   > "My expertise in large language model engineering — fine-tuning, RLHF, prompt engineering, inference optimization — is the scarcest skill set in AI. Fewer than 5,000 engineers globally have production LLM deployment experience. JPMorgan's LLM Suite initiative requires exactly this expertise. The $425K Systemic band ceiling is the appropriate compensation for a skill set this scarce and this central to the firm's AI strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $400K TC in New York by anchoring at $480K with competing AI lab and quant fund offers. Counter any initial offer below $350K by invoking automatic Systemic band classification — as an ML/AI Engineer, you are the definition of the January 2026 core infrastructure policy, and this should add $45K-$80K. Walk-away floor: $320K TC (New York), £260K TC (London), ₹68L TC (Bengaluru). Negotiate signing bonus as a separate track targeting $75K-$125K, framed as the discount you're accepting versus AI lab compensation. For London, insist on USD-denominated RSU grants at US-equivalent levels ($55K-$100K/year) and push for ED title to access the higher pay band. For Bengaluru ML/AI roles, negotiate a hybrid structure: locally calibrated base (₹50L+) with US-benchmarked RSU grants ($50K-$95K/year) — the RSU component is where 70%+ of the compensation leverage exists for India-based ML engineers.
