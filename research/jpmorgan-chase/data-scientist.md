#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at JPMorgan Chase sit at the epicenter of the firm's AI transformation. You build the models that drive credit risk scoring for $1T+ in consumer loans, optimize trading strategies across every asset class, detect fraud in real time across billions of annual transactions, and generate the analytical insights that inform C-suite strategic decisions. Unlike Big Tech data science roles that optimize advertising algorithms or engagement metrics, JPMorgan data scientists build models with direct financial and regulatory consequences — a model that misprices risk by 50 basis points can cost the firm hundreds of millions of dollars.

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified AI as a core infrastructure expense, placing it alongside cybersecurity and market risk in the firm's non-discretionary budget. Data Scientists are the most direct beneficiaries of this reclassification because they are the primary builders of the AI systems that this policy protects. Every model you develop, every algorithm you deploy, every analysis pipeline you maintain is now classified as core infrastructure. This is not an indirect adjacency — it is a direct classification of your primary work output as non-discretionary infrastructure.

For Data Scientist candidates, this creates the strongest possible negotiation position. The firm cannot argue that your role is tangentially related to AI — it is AI. The Systemic pay band premium of 15-25% applies to your role by the most literal reading of the January 2026 policy, and any offer that does not reflect this classification is inconsistent with the firm's own stated position.

#### Core Infrastructure — The Systemic Pay Band Premium

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified artificial intelligence as a core infrastructure expense, placing it in the same non-discretionary budget category as cybersecurity and market risk management. This activated "Systemic" pay bands for AI-related roles, commanding a 15-25% premium over standard technology pay bands. For a Data Scientist, this translates to $35K-$60K in additional annual total compensation.

- **Historical Precedent — Quant/Risk Parity:** JPMorgan's quantitative risk analysts have operated under Systemic-equivalent pay bands since the 2008 financial crisis made risk modeling a regulatory requirement. Data Scientists building predictive models are the modern equivalent of risk quants — their models directly inform capital allocation, credit decisioning, and regulatory reporting. The January 2026 reclassification formalizes what was already economically true: your models are infrastructure. Your negotiation opener: *"My models are the core AI infrastructure that JPMorgan reclassified as a non-negotiable expense on January 21, 2026. Quantitative risk analysts under equivalent Systemic bands earn $290K+ TC. I expect the same classification for my data science role — $300K TC minimum."*

- **The 15-25% Premium in Dollar Terms:** Standard tech band total compensation for a Data Scientist at JPMorgan ranges from $215K to $265K. Systemic band compensation ranges from $260K to $312K. The premium is concentrated in RSU grants (+$10K-$20K/year) and bonus targets (+$8K-$15K), with base salary adjustments of $10K-$18K. Data Scientists in Systemic bands also qualify for research publication budgets and conference attendance packages worth $5K-$10K annually.

- **Model Risk as Systemic Qualifier:** Every model you build at JPMorgan is subject to Model Risk Management (MRM) review under OCC Supervisory Guidance 2011-12 (SR 11-7). This regulatory framework treats model risk as a systemic concern — and the models themselves as critical infrastructure. This is your strongest qualification argument: *"Every model I develop will undergo MRM review as required by SR 11-7, which classifies model risk as systemic. If the models are systemic, the data scientist who builds them is systemic. I need my offer to reflect the Systemic pay band — $300K TC."*

- **AI Core Expense = Data Science Core Expense:** The January 2026 reclassification is, at its core, a reclassification of data science work. AI systems are built by data scientists and ML engineers. When JPMorgan says "AI is a core expense," they are saying "the people who build AI are a core expense." No other role has a more direct claim to Systemic classification. Use this directness: *"The January 2026 policy reclassifies AI as core infrastructure. I build AI. My role is core infrastructure by the most literal reading of this policy. The Systemic band premium should apply automatically — I'd like confirmation that my offer reflects this."*

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Big Tech / Quant Fund Dual Anchor**
   > "I have competing offers: $295K TC from [Google/Meta] as a Data Scientist, and $320K TC from [Two Sigma/Citadel/DE Shaw] as a Quantitative Researcher. JPMorgan's Data Scientist role combines both worlds — Big Tech scale ML with quant fund rigor. I'm targeting $310K TC, which represents the midpoint between these two competitive anchors and reflects the Systemic pay band premium."

2. **Lever 2 — Model Revenue Attribution**
   > "The models I'll build are projected to generate $XXM in incremental revenue through improved credit scoring, fraud reduction, or trading alpha. A $310K TC represents less than 0.5% of the value my models create. At quant funds, data scientists routinely earn 1-5% of the alpha they generate. My ask is conservative by any standard."

3. **Lever 3 — PhD / Advanced Degree Premium**
   > "My PhD in [statistics/ML/physics/economics] represents 5+ years of specialized training beyond a bachelor's degree. JPMorgan's own hiring data shows that PhD data scientists produce 40% more model deployments and significantly lower model risk incidents than non-PhD peers. I'm requesting a $20K base salary premium — $185K vs. $165K — to reflect this demonstrated productivity differential."

4. **Lever 4 — Regulatory Model Expertise Scarcity**
   > "Fewer than 3,000 data scientists globally have experience building models that pass SR 11-7 MRM review in a SIFI-regulated environment. This combination of ML expertise and regulatory model development experience is exceptionally scarce. The Systemic band ceiling of $312K TC reflects this scarcity, and I expect my offer to target the upper quartile of this band."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $290K TC in New York by anchoring at $325K with competing Big Tech and quant fund offers. Counter any initial offer below $255K by requesting Systemic band review — as a Data Scientist, you have the most direct claim to AI core infrastructure classification, and this escalation adds $35K-$55K. Walk-away floor: $240K TC (New York), £190K TC (London), ₹50L TC (Bengaluru). Negotiate signing bonus separately targeting $40K-$65K, framed as forfeited equity plus PhD opportunity cost. In London, push for Strats-equivalent classification (not generic tech DS) to access the higher pay band — the Strats designation alone is worth £25K-£40K in annual comp. In Bengaluru, negotiate for US-benchmarked RSU grants ($35K-$60K/year) and insist on MRM-track classification to differentiate from generic analytics roles.
