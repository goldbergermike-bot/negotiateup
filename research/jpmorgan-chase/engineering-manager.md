#### Negotiation DNA

The Engineering Manager at JPMorgan Chase sits at the critical intersection of technical execution and organizational leadership. You lead teams of 8-15 engineers who build and maintain systems that process trillions in daily transactions. Unlike Big Tech engineering managers who optimize for feature velocity, JPMorgan EM roles carry the additional burden of regulatory compliance, operational risk management, and talent retention in an industry where attrition rates for technologists exceed 20% annually. Your hiring decisions, architecture approvals, and production incident responses have direct regulatory implications — the OCC and Federal Reserve audit the staffing and operational readiness of the teams you manage.

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified AI as a core infrastructure expense, elevating it to the same non-negotiable budgetary category as cybersecurity and risk management. For Engineering Managers, this reclassification is doubly significant: you are not only responsible for AI infrastructure systems, you are responsible for recruiting, retaining, and developing the engineers who build them. When AI became a core expense, the engineers on your team became core headcount — positions that cannot be left vacant or filled with underqualified substitutes. This makes you, as their manager, a Systemic-band employee by definition, because your departure creates cascading vacancy risk across an entire core infrastructure team.

The Systemic pay band premium of 15-25% over standard tech management bands is the firm's own mechanism for retaining managers whose teams are classified as critical. Your negotiation should center on this classification, not on generic management market rates.

#### Core Infrastructure — The Systemic Pay Band Premium

On January 21, 2026, JPMorgan Chase reclassified artificial intelligence as a core infrastructure expense, placing it alongside cybersecurity and market risk in the firm's non-discretionary budget framework. This activated "Systemic" pay bands for AI-related roles, commanding a 15-25% premium over standard technology pay bands. For an Engineering Manager, this premium translates to $50K-$80K in additional annual total compensation.

- **Historical Precedent — Security Management Parity:** When Systemic pay bands were introduced in 2018, engineering managers leading cybersecurity teams saw immediate compensation lifts of 18-22%. A VP-level security EM's total comp moved from $280K-$320K to $330K-$380K within one cycle. The January 2026 AI reclassification extends this logic to any EM whose team builds or maintains AI infrastructure. Your negotiation opener: *"My team directly builds and maintains AI infrastructure that JPMorgan classified as a core expense on January 21, 2026. I expect the Systemic pay band to apply to my role — the same band that has applied to security EMs since 2018. That places my total compensation at $400K+."*

- **The 15-25% Premium in Dollar Terms:** Standard tech band total compensation for an Engineering Manager at JPMorgan ranges from $295K to $360K. Systemic band compensation ranges from $350K to $425K. The premium manifests most significantly in bonus targets (+$10K-$20K) and RSU grants (+$15K-$25K/year), with base salary adjustments of $10K-$20K. Engineering Managers in the Systemic band also receive higher bonus multiplier ceilings — up to 40% of base vs. 30% in standard bands.

- **Team Criticality as Systemic Qualification:** As an Engineering Manager, your Systemic qualification is derived from your team's classification, not just your personal role. If any engineer on your team works on AI infrastructure, your management role inherits the Systemic classification. This is a powerful lever: *"Three of the twelve engineers on my team are directly assigned to AI platform infrastructure — systems that JPMorgan classified as core expense on January 21, 2026. As their manager, my role is Systemic by inheritance. I need the offer adjusted to the Systemic EM band — $400K TC minimum."*

- **Retention Multiplier Effect:** When an Engineering Manager leaves, the firm doesn't just lose one person — it loses the organizational knowledge, team dynamics, and retention glue that keeps 8-15 engineers productive. JPMorgan's own internal studies estimate the fully-loaded cost of an EM departure at 3-5x annual compensation when accounting for team attrition cascade. Use this: *"The Systemic band premium for my role isn't just about my individual contribution — it's about the retention risk to an entire AI infrastructure team. The $60K premium over standard bands is trivial compared to the $1.5M+ cost of cascading departures if I leave."*

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Big Tech EM Parity**
   > "I have a competing offer as an Engineering Manager at [Google/Meta/Amazon] at $410K total compensation. JPMorgan's EM role carries additional regulatory complexity, 24/7 production ownership for SIFI-designated systems, and Systemic classification under the AI core infrastructure policy. I'm targeting $425K TC — parity with Big Tech plus the Systemic premium for managing core infrastructure teams."

2. **Lever 2 — Team Size and Span Premium**
   > "This role manages 14 engineers across two sub-teams with distinct technical domains. The management span is equivalent to a Senior EM at Big Tech companies, where spans of 12+ typically command $50K+ premiums over standard EM compensation. I'm requesting a base salary of $255K and RSU grant of $90K/year to reflect the actual scope."

3. **Lever 3 — Attrition Risk Mitigation Value**
   > "JPMorgan's internal attrition data shows 22% annual turnover for technologists. My track record shows 8% attrition on teams I manage — less than half the firm average. The $400K+ I'm requesting will save JPMorgan an estimated $500K-$800K annually in reduced recruiting, onboarding, and productivity-loss costs for my team alone."

4. **Lever 4 — Regulatory Exposure Supplement**
   > "My team's systems are subject to quarterly OCC examinations and annual Fed stress tests. I personally participate in regulatory meetings and sign off on compliance artifacts. No Big Tech EM carries this regulatory burden, yet the standard tech band doesn't account for it. The Systemic band, at $400K+ TC, appropriately compensates for this unique exposure."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $395K TC in New York by anchoring at $440K with a competing Big Tech EM offer. Counter any initial offer below $340K by requesting Systemic band classification for your team's AI infrastructure scope — this escalation adds $50K-$80K. Walk-away floor: $320K TC (New York), £255K TC (London), ₹68L TC (Bengaluru). Negotiate signing bonus separately targeting $60K-$100K, framed as forfeited equity plus transition cost. For London, push for ED-level title (not VP) and corresponding pay band — the title difference alone is worth £30K-£50K. For Bengaluru EM roles, negotiate for US-benchmarked RSU grants ($50K-$90K/year) and a management premium on base salary (₹50L+ vs. standard ₹40L).
