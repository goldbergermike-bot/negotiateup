#### Negotiation DNA

Goldman Sachs is not a traditional technology employer — it is a $2.8 trillion asset management and investment banking machine that happens to employ over 12,000 engineers. As a Software Engineer at Goldman, you are not simply writing code; you are building the foundational infrastructure that powers the firm's alpha-generating capabilities across its Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) division, its Global Markets trading desks, and its Marquee platform that serves institutional clients worldwide. CEO David Solomon's technology-driven transformation has repositioned Goldman's engineering division as a first-class revenue center, not a cost center, and your compensation should reflect that distinction.

The Picks & Shovels thesis is the defining framework for your negotiation. Goldman's 2026 Outlook argues that AI-driven market dispersion — where machine learning models identify pricing inefficiencies faster than ever — creates exponential demand for better infrastructure. You are the engineer who builds the picks and shovels that Goldman's portfolio managers and traders use to mine alpha. Whether you are working on the GS Marquee platform, the Goldman Sachs Developer (GSD) platform, or internal risk and pricing engines, your code directly accelerates revenue generation. This alpha-proximity commands a 10-20% premium over equivalent roles at pure-play technology companies, and your negotiation must anchor on that premium from the first conversation.

Your negotiation leverage is further amplified by Goldman's competitive positioning against both Wall Street peers (JPMorgan's Athena, Morgan Stanley's Matrix) and Big Tech firms (Google, Meta, Amazon) who aggressively recruit financial technology talent. Goldman must pay top-of-street to retain engineers who understand both distributed systems and financial domain logic — a rare and valuable intersection.

#### Picks & Shovels — The Active AWM Alpha Premium

Goldman's 2026 Outlook makes a bold strategic bet: in a world where AI-driven market dispersion is increasing the gap between winners and losers across asset classes, active management — not passive indexing — is the path to outsized returns. Goldman's AWM division, managing over $2.8 trillion in assets, is positioned as the premier active manager, and every basis point of alpha it generates flows directly to revenue. But alpha does not generate itself. It requires infrastructure — pricing engines, risk models, data pipelines, trading platforms, and client-facing analytics tools. Software Engineers are the literal picks-and-shovels providers in Goldman's alpha gold rush.

- **Alpha-Proximity Premium:** Goldman's Software Engineers who work on AWM-adjacent systems — portfolio construction tools, risk analytics, Marquee platform features — command a 10-20% compensation premium over engineers working on purely internal IT systems. For a Software Engineer, this translates to an additional $19K-$55K in annual total compensation. When negotiating, explicitly connect your technical skills to AWM revenue generation to unlock this premium tier.

- **AI Dispersion Infrastructure Demand:** As AI models create greater market dispersion, Goldman's AWM division requires increasingly sophisticated real-time data infrastructure. Software Engineers who can build low-latency data pipelines, event-driven architectures, and ML-serving infrastructure are directly enabling the firm's ability to capture alpha from AI-driven market dislocations. This skill set commands top-of-band offers.

- **Marquee Platform Revenue Multiplier:** Goldman's Marquee platform serves over 10,000 institutional clients and is a direct revenue generator through transaction facilitation and data licensing. Software Engineers contributing to Marquee are not cost-center employees — they are revenue-center builders. Frame your contributions in terms of client retention, transaction volume, and platform adoption metrics to justify above-midpoint compensation.

- **GSD Platform Leverage:** The Goldman Sachs Developer (GSD) platform is the internal engineering backbone that accelerates every other team's productivity. Engineers who improve GSD's CI/CD pipelines, developer tooling, and platform reliability create multiplicative value across the firm's 12,000+ engineering headcount. Quantify your impact as engineering hours saved multiplied across the organization to demonstrate outsized value.

#### Global Levers

**1. Competing Offer Arbitrage ($15K-$40K lever)**
Goldman's recruiting team is acutely aware of Big Tech compensation. Present a competing offer from Google, Meta, or Amazon and use the following script: *"I have an offer from [Company] at $[X] total comp. I am genuinely excited about Goldman's engineering culture and the Picks & Shovels thesis — building infrastructure that directly generates alpha is more compelling than ad optimization. However, I need the compensation to reflect the specialized financial domain knowledge Goldman requires. Can we close the gap to $[X + 10-15%]?"*

**2. Sign-On Bonus Acceleration ($20K-$50K lever)**
Goldman routinely offers sign-on bonuses to offset unvested equity from prior employers. Even if you do not have unvested equity, use this lever: *"I am leaving behind [annual bonus / unvested equity / deferred comp] at my current employer. A sign-on bonus of $[30K-50K] would make the transition seamless and allow me to start contributing to the Marquee platform from day one without financial distraction."*

**3. RSU Grant Uplift ($10K-$25K/year lever)**
Goldman's RSU grants vest over four years and are denominated in GS stock. Use Goldman's strong stock performance to argue for larger initial grants: *"Given Goldman's stock trajectory and the firm's public commitment to technology investment, I would like to increase the initial RSU grant by $[40K-100K over 4 years]. This aligns my incentives with the firm's long-term technology transformation."*

**4. Guaranteed Bonus Floor ($10K-$25K lever)**
Goldman's discretionary bonus culture can create uncertainty. Negotiate a guaranteed first-year bonus floor: *"I understand Goldman's bonus structure is discretionary and tied to firm performance. For my first year, I would like a guaranteed minimum bonus of $[35K-50K] to reflect my confidence in contributing immediately to the AWM platform engineering roadmap."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at the 75th percentile of the New York range ($248K TC). Present your competing offer or market data showing top-of-street compensation for engineers with financial infrastructure experience. If Goldman counters below $230K, push back by emphasizing the Picks & Shovels premium: "Engineers building alpha-generating infrastructure should be compensated at the top of the band, not the middle." Your walk-away floor should be $215K TC for New York, £170K TC for London, and ₹60L TC for Bengaluru. For counter-offers, request that any gap be closed through sign-on bonus ($25K-$40K) or RSU uplift ($20K-$40K over 4 years), as these are easier for Goldman's comp committee to approve than base salary increases.
