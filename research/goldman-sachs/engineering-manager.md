#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at Goldman Sachs occupy a uniquely powerful position in the firm's technology transformation. Mapped to the VP or Executive Director level depending on team size and scope, you are responsible for building, scaling, and retaining the engineering teams that construct Goldman's alpha-generating infrastructure. In an organization of 12,000+ engineers where CEO David Solomon has publicly tied Goldman's competitive future to technology excellence, the engineering manager is not a support function — you are the organizational architect who determines whether Goldman can execute its Picks & Shovels strategy at scale.

Goldman's engineering management role differs fundamentally from its Big Tech equivalent. At Google or Meta, an engineering manager optimizes for product velocity and team health. At Goldman, you optimize for all of those plus regulatory compliance, risk management culture, and direct alignment with revenue-generating business units. Your teams build systems where a single bug can trigger regulatory scrutiny or a P&L impact measured in millions. This additional complexity and accountability commands a premium over standard tech management compensation, and your negotiation should explicitly reference this elevated risk profile.

The Picks & Shovels thesis translates directly to your role: you are the foreman of the mining operation. You determine which engineers get hired, which systems get prioritized, and how technical resources are allocated across Goldman's AWM alpha infrastructure. Your organizational decisions — team topology, hiring bar, technical standards — have a multiplicative effect on Goldman's ability to capture AI-driven market dispersion. This strategic leverage, combined with Goldman's aggressive retention needs for experienced engineering leaders, places you in a strong negotiating position.

#### Picks & Shovels — The Active AWM Alpha Premium

Goldman's 2026 Outlook makes Active AWM the centerpiece of the firm's growth strategy, arguing that AI-driven market dispersion creates unprecedented opportunities for active managers with the right infrastructure. Engineering Managers are the critical bottleneck in this strategy — without effective engineering leadership, Goldman cannot hire, retain, and direct the engineers who build the picks and shovels. You are not managing a team; you are managing the supply chain of Goldman's alpha-generating infrastructure.

- **Alpha-Proximity Premium for Engineering Leaders:** Engineering Managers whose teams build AWM-adjacent systems command a 12-18% compensation premium over managers of internal-facing engineering teams. For this role, that translates to $37K-$80K in additional annual total compensation. Negotiate by quantifying your team's output in revenue terms: "My team of [X] engineers builds and maintains the [specific system] that processes $[Y]B in daily AWM transaction volume. Our uptime directly correlates to revenue capture."

- **AI Dispersion Talent Strategy:** As AI-driven market dispersion creates demand for increasingly specialized engineers — ML infrastructure specialists, low-latency systems engineers, financial data pipeline architects — the Engineering Manager who can recruit and retain this talent becomes a strategic asset. Frame your talent acquisition track record as a direct enabler of Goldman's dispersion-capture strategy: "I have built and scaled teams of [X] engineers specializing in [AI/ML infrastructure], which is exactly the talent Goldman needs to execute its 2026 AWM technology roadmap."

- **Organizational Leverage Multiplier:** An Engineering Manager's impact is measured not by individual contribution but by the multiplicative output of their team. If you manage 15 engineers each generating $125K in attributed revenue, your organizational output is $1.875M. Frame your compensation as a fraction of your team's total output: "My teams have consistently delivered $[X]M in attributed platform value. My compensation at $[Y]K represents [Z]% of that value — well within Goldman's target for management leverage ratios."

- **Retention and Attrition Cost Economics:** Goldman's engineering attrition rate for VP-level engineers is approximately 15-20% annually, with each departure costing $300K-$500K in replacement costs. An Engineering Manager who reduces attrition by even 3-5% across a 15-person team saves Goldman $135K-$375K annually. Use this framing: "My management approach has historically reduced team attrition to [X]% versus the [Y]% industry average. That retention value alone justifies top-of-band compensation."

#### Global Levers

**1. Team Size and Scope Uplift ($30K-$70K lever)**
Goldman's compensation bands for Engineering Managers scale with team size and organizational scope. If you are managing or will manage 15+ engineers across multiple teams, negotiate for ED-level compensation. Script: *"Given the scope of this role — [X] engineers across [Y] teams delivering [Z platform] — I believe Executive Director-level compensation starting at $[400K TC] is appropriate. This scope exceeds the VP-level engineering management band."*

**2. Competing Big Tech Management Offer ($30K-$80K lever)**
Engineering management offers from Google (L6/L7 Manager), Meta (M1/M2), and Amazon (L7 Manager) are the most effective comparables. Script: *"I have a competing offer from [Google/Meta] at $[X] TC for an engineering management role of comparable scope. Goldman's mission is more compelling, but I need the compensation to reflect that I am choosing Goldman over a [Google L7 / Meta M2] offer."*

**3. Sign-On Bonus for Unvested Equity Bridge ($35K-$80K lever)**
Engineering managers often have significant unvested equity from prior employers. Script: *"I am forfeiting $[X]K in unvested RSUs at my current employer to join Goldman. I am requesting a sign-on bonus of $[60K-80K] paid over 12 months to bridge this gap. This investment ensures I can focus entirely on building the AWM engineering team from day one."*

**4. Guaranteed Bonus and Equity Refresh ($25K-$50K/year lever)**
Negotiate for a guaranteed first-year bonus floor and committed annual RSU refreshes. Script: *"I understand Goldman's bonus is discretionary, and I support performance-driven compensation. For my first year, I am requesting a guaranteed minimum bonus of $[50K-65K] and a committed annual RSU refresh of $[60K-80K] tied to team delivery milestones."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at the 75th-80th percentile of the New York range ($410K TC). Lead with organizational impact: "I am not negotiating for a management position — I am negotiating for the engineering leadership role that determines whether Goldman can execute its Picks & Shovels strategy at scale. My teams will build the infrastructure that enables $[X]B in AWM alpha generation." If Goldman counters below $370K, respond: "At $370K, Goldman is pricing this role below what Google pays an L6 Manager with equivalent scope, and significantly below what senior engineering leaders command at Citadel or Two Sigma. I need $395K+ to proceed." Your walk-away floor should be $340K TC for New York, £260K TC for London, and ₹95L TC for Bengaluru. Close gaps through sign-on ($40K-$80K), guaranteed Year 1 bonus ($50K+), and RSU refresh commitments.
