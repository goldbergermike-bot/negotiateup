#### Negotiation DNA

Product Managers at Goldman Sachs operate in a fundamentally different context than their Big Tech counterparts. At Google or Meta, a PM optimizes user engagement metrics and advertising revenue. At Goldman, you define the product strategy for platforms that institutional investors, portfolio managers, and traders use to move billions of dollars daily. Your product decisions on the Marquee platform, GSD developer tools, or AWM analytics interfaces directly influence Goldman's ability to generate alpha, retain institutional clients, and differentiate against JPMorgan's Athena and Morgan Stanley's competing offerings. This revenue proximity is not incidental — it is the defining characteristic of your role.

Goldman's product management function has grown significantly under CEO David Solomon's technology transformation, but it remains smaller and more concentrated than at Big Tech firms. Goldman employs roughly 200-300 product managers across its engineering division compared to thousands at Google or Amazon. This concentration means each PM owns a disproportionately large surface area of Goldman's technology platform, and your individual product decisions have outsized business impact. Your negotiation should leverage this concentration: you are not one of thousands — you are one of a select few who define the product direction for a $2.8 trillion asset management machine.

The Picks & Shovels thesis applies directly to product management: you decide which picks and shovels get built, in what order, and for which users. Your product roadmap determines Goldman's engineering investment priorities, and those priorities determine whether the AWM division can capture AI-driven market dispersion faster than competitors. This strategic decision-making authority commands a premium that reflects your role as the nexus between Goldman's engineering capability and its revenue-generating business units.

#### Picks & Shovels — The Active AWM Alpha Premium

Goldman's 2026 Outlook centers Active AWM as the firm's growth engine, and the product managers who define the tools, platforms, and interfaces for AWM are the strategic decision-makers in Goldman's Picks & Shovels supply chain. You do not just manage a product backlog — you determine which alpha-generating capabilities Goldman builds next, which client-facing features differentiate Marquee from competing platforms, and how Goldman's engineering resources are allocated across the AWM technology stack.

- **Alpha-Proximity Premium for Product Leaders:** Product Managers working on AWM-adjacent platforms — Marquee analytics, portfolio construction tools, risk visualization interfaces — command a 10-18% compensation premium over PMs working on internal tools or compliance platforms. For this role, that translates to $23K-$60K in additional annual total compensation. Negotiate by connecting your product decisions to revenue: "The product roadmap I define determines which AWM capabilities Goldman brings to market, directly impacting the firm's ability to capture $[X]M in alpha-driven revenue."

- **AI Dispersion Product Strategy:** As AI creates greater market dispersion, Goldman's AWM clients demand increasingly sophisticated tools to identify and act on alpha opportunities. Product Managers who can translate AI model outputs into intuitive, actionable interfaces for portfolio managers are bridging the gap between Goldman's technical capabilities and its revenue generation. Frame your expertise in AI product design as a direct enabler of the dispersion-capture thesis.

- **Marquee Platform Revenue Attribution:** Goldman's Marquee platform generates revenue through transaction facilitation, data licensing, and client retention. Product Managers who drive Marquee adoption — measured in client onboarding, feature adoption, and transaction volume — have directly attributable revenue impact. Quantify your product impact in these terms: "My product decisions have driven [X]% increase in platform adoption, translating to $[Y]M in incremental revenue."

- **Product-Engineering Leverage Ratio:** At Goldman, each Product Manager typically directs 15-25 engineers. Your product decisions determine how $2M-$4M in annual engineering labor is allocated. Frame your compensation as a small fraction of the engineering investment you direct: "I direct the allocation of $[X]M in annual engineering resources. My compensation at $[Y]K represents [Z]% of that investment — a strong ROI for Goldman."

#### Global Levers

**1. Big Tech Product Offer Comparison ($20K-$55K lever)**
Product management offers from Google (L6 PM), Meta (IC5 PM), and Amazon (L6 PM) are strong comparables. Script: *"I have a competing offer from [Google/Meta] at $[X] TC for a product management role. Goldman's Marquee platform and AWM product strategy are more compelling to me professionally, but the compensation gap of $[Y]K needs to be addressed. Can we close this through RSU uplift and sign-on bonus?"*

**2. Revenue Attribution Framing ($15K-$40K lever)**
Unlike Big Tech PMs who optimize engagement metrics, your decisions have directly attributable revenue impact. Script: *"At my current company, the product decisions I made drove $[X]M in incremental revenue over [Y] months. At Goldman, the revenue surface area is significantly larger — Marquee alone facilitates billions in transactions. My compensation should reflect the scale of revenue my product decisions will influence."*

**3. Sign-On Bonus for Transition Cost ($25K-$50K lever)**
Script: *"I am leaving $[X]K in unvested equity and forfeiting my annual bonus cycle at my current employer. A sign-on bonus of $[35K-50K] bridges this transition cost and ensures I can commit fully to Goldman's AWM product roadmap without financial reservation."*

**4. Guaranteed First-Year Bonus ($15K-$30K lever)**
Script: *"Goldman's discretionary bonus structure means my first-year bonus depends on factors I cannot yet influence. I am requesting a guaranteed minimum bonus of $[40K-50K] for my first year to reflect my commitment to delivering measurable product outcomes for the AWM division."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at the 75th percentile of the New York range ($310K TC). Lead with revenue proximity: "I am not negotiating for a product management role at a technology company — I am negotiating for a revenue-proximate product leadership position at a $2.8 trillion financial institution. My product decisions will directly influence Goldman's AWM alpha generation." If Goldman counters below $275K, respond: "At $275K, Goldman is pricing this role below what Google pays a mid-level PM, despite the fact that my product decisions at Goldman have 10x the revenue impact of an equivalent PM at a Big Tech firm. I need $295K+ to proceed." Your walk-away floor should be $260K TC for New York, £200K TC for London, and ₹72L TC for Bengaluru. Close gaps through sign-on ($30K-$50K), guaranteed Year 1 bonus ($35K+), and RSU uplift.
