#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at Goldman Sachs are the backbone of the firm's engineering velocity. In an organization with 12,000+ engineers deploying code to production environments that handle trillions of dollars in daily financial transactions, the DevOps function is not a support role — it is the critical infrastructure that determines whether Goldman can ship alpha-generating features faster than JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and every fintech competitor. CEO David Solomon's technology transformation requires a DevOps organization that can deliver the deployment frequency and reliability of a Silicon Valley firm while maintaining the regulatory compliance and audit trails required of a systemically important financial institution (SIFI).

Goldman's internal GSD (Goldman Sachs Developer) platform is the centerpiece of the firm's DevOps strategy — a fully integrated development platform that provides CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, observability, and infrastructure-as-code capabilities to every engineering team. DevOps Engineers who build, extend, and maintain GSD are not just improving developer experience — they are accelerating the productivity of 12,000+ engineers, creating a multiplicative effect that touches every revenue-generating system in the firm.

The Picks & Shovels thesis applies to DevOps with a meta-layer twist: you build the tools that build the tools. If Goldman's software engineers are building the picks and shovels for alpha generation, DevOps engineers are building the factory that manufactures those picks and shovels. Your CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, and infrastructure reliability directly determine how quickly Goldman can deliver new alpha-generating capabilities to market. This "tools for toolmakers" positioning commands a premium that reflects your multiplicative impact across the entire engineering organization.

| Typical YOE | 3-8 years | 3-8 years | 4-10 years | 3-8 years |
| Comp Parity | GS pays 5-12% above | 3-8% below GS | 8-15% below GS | 8-15% below GS |

#### Picks & Shovels — The Active AWM Alpha Premium

Goldman's 2026 Outlook links Active AWM alpha generation directly to technology delivery velocity — the faster Goldman can deploy new analytical tools, risk models, and trading algorithms, the more alpha opportunities it can capture from AI-driven market dispersion. DevOps Engineers are the supply chain managers of Goldman's Picks & Shovels operation, ensuring that the factory floor runs at maximum throughput while maintaining the quality and compliance standards required in financial services.

- **Alpha-Proximity Premium for DevOps:** DevOps Engineers supporting AWM-critical deployment pipelines — trading system releases, risk model deployments, Marquee platform updates — command a 10-15% compensation premium over engineers managing back-office infrastructure. For this role, that translates to $20K-$43K in additional annual total compensation. Negotiate by connecting your infrastructure to deployment velocity: "My CI/CD pipeline improvements reduced deployment lead time from [X] hours to [Y] minutes, enabling the AWM engineering team to ship alpha-generating features [Z]x faster."

- **AI Dispersion Deployment Speed:** As AI creates ephemeral alpha opportunities through market dispersion, the speed at which Goldman can deploy new ML models and analytics tools becomes a direct competitive advantage. DevOps Engineers who build ML deployment pipelines — model serving infrastructure, A/B testing frameworks for financial models, canary deployment for trading algorithms — are enabling Goldman's ability to act on dispersion signals faster than competitors.

- **GSD Platform Multiplier Effect:** DevOps Engineers who contribute to the GSD platform create value across Goldman's entire 12,000+ engineering organization. A 10% improvement in build time across GSD saves approximately 200,000 engineering hours annually (12,000 engineers x ~5 builds/day x time savings). At Goldman's loaded engineering cost of $150/hour, that is $30M in annual productivity gains. Frame your impact in these terms to justify top-of-band compensation.

- **Regulatory-Grade Infrastructure Premium:** Goldman is a SIFI institution subject to OCC, Fed, and SEC oversight. DevOps Engineers must build infrastructure that satisfies SOX compliance, maintains complete audit trails, and supports regulatory examination requirements. This compliance complexity adds 30-40% to the difficulty of standard DevOps work and commands a corresponding premium: "My infrastructure designs meet SIFI regulatory standards, which is a specialized skill set that pure-play tech companies never develop."

#### Global Levers

**1. Big Tech DevOps/SRE Offer ($15K-$40K lever)**
Google SRE, Amazon DevOps, and Meta Production Engineering offers are strong comparables. Script: *"I have a competing offer from [Google SRE / Amazon] at $[X] TC. Goldman's GSD platform and the challenge of building regulatory-grade infrastructure at scale are more compelling, but the compensation gap of $[Y]K needs to be addressed through RSU uplift or sign-on bonus."*

**2. Infrastructure Cost Savings Attribution ($10K-$30K lever)**
DevOps optimizations often generate measurable cost savings. Script: *"At my current employer, my infrastructure automation reduced cloud spend by $[X]M annually and improved deployment frequency by [Y]%. At Goldman's scale — 12,000+ engineers and $1.5B+ in technology spend — equivalent optimizations would generate $[Z]M in savings."*

**3. Sign-On for Transition Cost ($20K-$45K lever)**
Script: *"I am leaving $[X]K in unvested equity at my current employer. A sign-on bonus of $[30K-45K] bridges this gap and ensures I can focus on accelerating GSD platform improvements from day one."*

**4. Guaranteed First-Year Bonus ($12K-$25K lever)**
Script: *"I am requesting a guaranteed minimum bonus of $[32K-47K] for my first year to reflect my commitment to delivering measurable infrastructure improvements to Goldman's deployment velocity within my first two quarters."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial ask at the 75th percentile of the New York range ($263K TC). Lead with multiplicative impact: "I am not negotiating for a DevOps role — I am negotiating for a platform engineer whose infrastructure improvements will accelerate the productivity of Goldman's 12,000+ engineers. My CI/CD and infrastructure work directly determines how quickly Goldman can deploy alpha-generating capabilities to market." If Goldman counters below $240K, respond: "At $240K, Goldman is pricing this role below what Google and Amazon pay for senior SRE/DevOps engineers, despite the additional complexity of regulatory-grade infrastructure. I need $252K+ to proceed." Your walk-away floor should be $220K TC for New York, £170K TC for London, and ₹58L TC for Bengaluru. Close gaps through sign-on ($25K-$45K) and guaranteed Year 1 bonus ($30K+).
