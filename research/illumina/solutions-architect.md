**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Illumina design the technical architecture for genomics platform integrations, customer deployments, and end-to-end sequencing workflows. The role bridges Illumina's product capabilities with customer requirements — designing architectures for clinical genomics labs, research institutions, population genomics programs, and pharmaceutical R&D centers. Solutions Architects must understand the complete genomics workflow (sample prep, sequencing, primary/secondary/tertiary analysis, clinical interpretation) and design technical solutions that integrate Illumina instruments, BaseSpace, DRAGEN, and customer systems (LIMS, EHR, data lakes). The role is client-facing and requires deep genomics domain expertise. [Source: Illumina Solutions Architecture 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Illumina SA = Google L5 Solutions = Genentech SA = Moderna SA

**Global Levers**

1. **Customer-Facing Genomics Architecture:** "I design architectures for Illumina's largest customers — clinical labs, research institutions, and pharma R&D. Each deployment represents millions in instrument and consumable revenue."
2. **San Diego SA Market:** "Solutions architects in San Diego biotech command $200K-$310K TC."
3. **End-to-End Genomics Workflow:** "I understand the complete sequencing workflow from sample prep to clinical interpretation — essential for designing integrated solutions."
4. **Bonus + RSU Push:** "Target 18% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with RSUs at $150K/4yr and an 18% bonus. My genomics solutions architecture experience directly supports Illumina's customer deployment success." Illumina will counter at $170K-$195K base with $85K-$130K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $265K. Push on RSU and bonus.
