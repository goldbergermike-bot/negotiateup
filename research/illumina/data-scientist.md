### Data Scientist | Illumina Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Genomics/Sequencing Dominant / Specialized Biotech Comp / RSU + Bonus / Genomic Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego CA | $145K–$200K | $60K–$160K/4yr | 10–15% | $180K–$285K |
| Bay Area CA | $150K–$205K | $65K–$165K/4yr | 10–15% | $190K–$295K |
| Remote US | $135K–$190K | $55K–$150K/4yr | 10–15% | $170K–$270K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Illumina build analytical models and algorithms that improve sequencing accuracy, accelerate data interpretation, and enable clinical genomics applications. The role sits at the intersection of statistics, genomics, and applied ML — building models for variant calling accuracy improvement, quality score calibration, sample contamination detection, and population-level genomic analysis. Illumina's data scientists have access to some of the largest genomic datasets in the world, enabling analyses at scales that smaller companies can't match. The role requires strong statistical methodology (Bayesian inference, hypothesis testing, survival analysis) combined with genomics domain knowledge (population genetics, variant annotation, clinical significance).

**Level Mapping:** Illumina Data Scientist = Google L4 DS = Genentech DS = 10x Genomics DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Genomic Sequencing Algorithm Impact:** "My analytical models directly improve the accuracy and speed of Illumina's sequencing platform — used by 80% of the world's genomics researchers and clinicians."
2. **San Diego DS Market:** "Data scientists in San Diego biotech command $180K-$285K TC."
3. **Genomics + Statistics Hybrid:** "Combining statistical expertise with genomics domain knowledge is rare."
4. **ILMN Stock + Bonus Push:** "Target 15% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $195K with RSUs at $140K/4yr and a 15% bonus. My genomics data science experience with [variant analysis / sequencing algorithms / clinical genomics] directly improves Illumina's platform." Illumina will counter at $160K-$185K base with $75K-$120K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $240K. Push on RSU.
