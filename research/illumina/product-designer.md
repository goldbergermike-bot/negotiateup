**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Illumina design interfaces for genomics instruments, BaseSpace cloud analytics, clinical interpretation tools, and researcher-facing applications. The role requires designing for highly specialized users — molecular biologists, clinical geneticists, bioinformaticians, and lab technicians — each with unique workflow requirements and domain expertise. Illumina's design challenges include visualizing complex genomic data (variant browsers, coverage plots, phylogenetic trees), designing instrument control interfaces for multi-day sequencing runs, and creating clinical genomics reporting tools that satisfy regulatory requirements.

**Global Levers**

1. **Scientific Interface Expertise:** "Designing for genomics researchers and clinicians requires domain understanding that general UX designers lack."
2. **San Diego Design Market:** "Product designers in San Diego biotech command $155K-$245K TC."
3. **Clinical Genomics Compliance:** "Clinical genomics interfaces require IVD regulatory awareness and validation-ready design."
4. **ILMN Stock + Bonus Push:** "Target 15% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $175K with RSUs at $115K/4yr and a 15% bonus. My scientific interface design experience directly maps to Illumina's genomics platform UX needs." Illumina will counter at $140K-$165K base with $60K-$100K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $200K. Push on base.
