**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Illumina lead teams building the software platform for the world's dominant sequencing technology. EMs must manage engineers with diverse expertise — bioinformatics, embedded systems, cloud, data engineering — while partnering with genomics scientists and product leaders. The EM role at Illumina requires scientific fluency: understanding genomics well enough to evaluate technical proposals and set priorities for platform development. Illumina's engineering management culture values technical depth, cross-functional partnership, and the ability to navigate a matrixed organization that spans instruments, informatics, clinical applications, and commercial teams.

**Level Mapping:** Illumina EM = Google L5-L6 EM = Genentech EM = Moderna EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Scope Leadership:** "I lead the team building software for 80% of the world's sequencing data. This platform-level scope justifies premium EM compensation."
2. **San Diego EM Market:** "EMs in San Diego biotech command $240K-$365K TC."
3. **Scientific Partnership Premium:** "Leading engineering teams that partner with genomics scientists requires domain fluency beyond standard tech EM roles."
4. **Bonus + RSU Maximization:** "Target 22% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $225K with RSUs at $195K/4yr and a 22% bonus. My experience leading engineering teams in [genomics / biotech / scientific computing] makes me immediately effective." Illumina will counter at $190K-$215K base with $105K-$170K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $305K. Push on bonus and RSU.
