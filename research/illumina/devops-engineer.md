**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Illumina manage the cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines for BaseSpace (Illumina's cloud genomics platform), DRAGEN on cloud, instrument software builds, and enterprise systems. The role is uniquely complex: managing infrastructure for genomics workloads that are extremely compute-intensive (genome alignment, variant calling) while meeting clinical genomics compliance requirements (CAP/CLIA for clinical labs, HIPAA for patient data, IVD regulatory standards). DevOps engineers at Illumina build auto-scaling infrastructure for bursty genomics workloads, optimize cost efficiency for petabyte-scale data storage, and ensure the reliability of clinical-grade genomics analysis pipelines.

**Level Mapping:** Illumina DevOps = Google L3-L4 SRE = Genentech DevOps = Moderna DevOps

**Global Levers**

1. **Clinical Genomics Infrastructure:** "Genomics infrastructure for clinical applications (CAP/CLIA labs) requires compliance-aware DevOps that standard cloud engineers don't have."
2. **San Diego DevOps Market:** "DevOps in San Diego biotech commands $170K-$275K TC."
3. **Genomics Compute Optimization:** "Genomics workloads are compute-intensive with bursty patterns. I bring experience optimizing cloud infrastructure for these unique patterns."
4. **ILMN Stock + Bonus Push:** "Target 15% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $190K with RSUs at $135K/4yr and a 15% bonus. My cloud infrastructure experience with [genomics workloads / clinical compliance / high-compute environments] maps directly to Illumina's BaseSpace and DRAGEN infrastructure." Illumina will counter at $155K-$180K base with $70K-$115K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $225K. Push on RSU.
