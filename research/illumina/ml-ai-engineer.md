**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Illumina build machine learning models that improve sequencing accuracy, accelerate bioinformatics analysis, and enable new genomics applications. Illumina's AI strategy spans base calling (converting raw signal to DNA sequence using deep learning), variant calling (identifying genetic variants with neural network-based tools), quality prediction (ML models for sequencing quality assessment), and clinical interpretation (AI-assisted variant classification for clinical genomics). The DRAGEN platform increasingly incorporates ML models for improved accuracy, and BaseSpace uses AI for automated analysis recommendations. ML engineers at Illumina work at the intersection of deep learning and genomics — training models on some of the largest genomic datasets in existence.

**Level Mapping:** Illumina ML Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML = Genentech ML = 10x Genomics ML

**Global Levers**

1. **Genomics AI Scarcity:** "ML engineers who understand both deep learning and genomics data (base calling, variant calling, sequence alignment) are extremely rare."
2. **San Diego AI Market:** "ML engineers in San Diego biotech command $210K-$325K TC."
3. **DRAGEN AI Integration:** "I build ML models for DRAGEN — the world's most widely-used bioinformatics processor. Every model improvement affects 80% of global sequencing."
4. **ILMN Stock + Bonus + AI Premium:** "Target 18% bonus, top RSU grants, and explicit AI premium confirmation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $210K with RSUs at $165K/4yr and an 18% bonus. My genomics ML experience with [base calling / variant calling / deep learning for genomics] directly improves Illumina's sequencing platform accuracy." Illumina will counter at $175K-$200K base with $90K-$140K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $275K. Push on RSU and bonus.
