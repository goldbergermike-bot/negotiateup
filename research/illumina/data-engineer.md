### Data Engineer | Illumina Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Genomics/Sequencing Dominant / Specialized Biotech Comp / RSU + Bonus / Genomic Data Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego CA | $140K–$195K | $55K–$155K/4yr | 10–15% | $170K–$275K |
| Bay Area CA | $145K–$200K | $60K–$160K/4yr | 10–15% | $180K–$285K |
| Remote US | $130K–$185K | $50K–$145K/4yr | 10–15% | $160K–$260K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Illumina build the data infrastructure that processes, stores, and serves the world's genomic data. A single NovaSeq X sequencing run generates ~6TB of raw data, and Illumina's instruments collectively produce petabytes of genomic data annually. Data engineers build pipelines that ingest raw sequencing data (FASTQ), manage secondary analysis outputs (BAM, VCF), integrate with BaseSpace cloud storage, and feed downstream analytics and clinical interpretation systems. The role requires expertise in distributed data processing (Spark, Databricks), cloud data infrastructure (AWS, Azure), and genomics-specific data formats and standards. Illumina's data engineering is uniquely challenging because of the volume and complexity of genomic data — each genome is ~100GB of raw data, and population-scale projects process thousands of genomes simultaneously.

**Level Mapping:** Illumina Data Engineer = Google L3-L4 DE = Genentech DE = Moderna DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Genomic Data Scale:** "A single sequencing run generates 6TB of raw data. I'm building infrastructure for the most data-intensive instruments in biology. This scale requires specialized data engineering expertise."
2. **San Diego DE Market:** "Data engineers in San Diego biotech command $170K-$275K TC."
3. **Genomics Data Format Expertise:** "I bring experience with FASTQ, BAM, VCF, and genomics data standards that general data engineers lack."
4. **ILMN Stock + Bonus Push:** "Target 15% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $190K with RSUs at $135K/4yr and a 15% bonus. My genomics data engineering experience with [FASTQ / BAM / VCF / cloud genomics] directly maps to Illumina's data platform needs." Illumina will counter at $155K-$180K base with $70K-$115K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $225K. Push on RSU.
