**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Illumina drive complex, cross-functional programs spanning instrument development, informatics platforms, clinical applications, and manufacturing. Illumina's TPMs coordinate across hardware engineering (instrument development), software engineering (instrument firmware, BaseSpace, DRAGEN), bioinformatics (algorithms, analysis pipelines), and clinical/regulatory teams (IVD submissions, CAP/CLIA validation). Programs often span 12-24 months with interdependencies between instrument hardware timelines, software development cycles, and regulatory submission schedules. The role requires technical fluency across hardware and software, genomics domain knowledge, and the ability to manage programs with regulatory compliance requirements.

**Level Mapping:** Illumina TPM = Google L4-L5 TPM = Genentech TPM = Moderna TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Hardware-Software Program Complexity:** "Illumina programs span instrument hardware and software development — a level of cross-disciplinary program management that most tech TPMs never encounter."
2. **San Diego TPM Market:** "TPMs in San Diego biotech command $190K-$300K TC."
3. **Regulatory Program Expertise:** "I bring experience managing programs with IVD regulatory submissions, CAP/CLIA validation, and FDA clearance timelines."
4. **Bonus + RSU Push:** "Target 18% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $200K with RSUs at $145K/4yr and an 18% bonus. My experience managing cross-disciplinary technology programs in [genomics / biotech / regulated environments] directly maps to Illumina's most complex programs." Illumina will counter at $165K-$190K base with $80K-$125K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $255K. Push on bonus and RSU.
