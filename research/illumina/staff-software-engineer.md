**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Illumina set the technical direction for the entire genomics software platform — from instrument firmware through cloud analytics. At this level, engineers influence cross-platform architectural decisions, lead the most complex technical initiatives (DRAGEN algorithm development, BaseSpace scalability, clinical genomics validation), and represent Illumina's technical perspective to the broader genomics community. Staff engineers at Illumina need deep expertise in at least one domain (instrument software, bioinformatics, cloud) while understanding the end-to-end genomics workflow well enough to make platform-wide decisions. Illumina's Staff engineers often interact with key opinion leaders in genomics, representing the company at scientific conferences and customer engagements.

**Level Mapping:** Illumina Staff SWE = Google L5-L6 = Genentech Staff = Microsoft Principal

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform-Wide Technical Direction:** "I set the technical direction for software that processes 80% of the world's genomic data. This platform-wide scope justifies Big Tech L5-L6 equivalent comp."
2. **San Diego Staff Market:** "Staff engineers in San Diego biotech command $260K-$395K TC."
3. **Genomics Technical Authority:** "At the Staff level, I represent Illumina's technical authority at conferences, customer engagements, and industry partnerships."
4. **ILMN Stock + Bonus Maximization:** "Target 22% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $240K with RSUs at $220K/4yr and a 22% bonus. I'm setting the technical direction for the world's dominant genomics software platform." Illumina will counter at $200K-$230K base with $120K-$190K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $330K. Push hard on RSU and bonus.
