**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Illumina build the software ecosystem supporting the world's dominant DNA sequencing platform. The engineering scope spans instrument control software (embedded systems managing sequencing chemistry), BaseSpace Sequence Hub (cloud-based genomics analytics platform), DRAGEN (FPGA-accelerated bioinformatics), Connected Software (instrument fleet management), and enterprise systems. Illumina's SWEs work across a unique range of technical challenges — from real-time instrument firmware to cloud-scale genomics data processing. The company's San Diego headquarters offers a strong quality of life with biotech compensation. Illumina ($20B market cap) has faced stock pressure from GRAIL spinoff complications and competition from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore, but its 80% sequencing market share provides strong business fundamentals.

**Level Mapping:** Illumina SWE = Google L3-L4 = Genentech SWE = Moderna SWE (comparable TC)

**Global Levers**

1. **San Diego Biotech Market:** "San Diego biotech SWEs command $165K-$270K TC. Illumina competes with Thermo Fisher, Dexcom, and tech companies for software talent."
2. **Genomics Domain Value:** "Software engineering for genomics instruments and data processing requires domain expertise that general SWEs lack. My genomics background shortens the ramp significantly."
3. **ILMN Stock Recovery Potential:** "Illumina stock has recovery upside from current levels. Push for top RSU grants to maximize equity participation."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "Illumina bonus targets range from 10-15%. Target 15% for engineering roles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $185K with RSUs at $130K/4yr and a 15% bonus target. My experience building [genomics software / instrument systems / cloud analytics] at [current company] directly maps to Illumina's platform needs." Illumina will counter at $150K-$175K base with $65K-$110K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $215K. Push on RSU for stock recovery upside.
