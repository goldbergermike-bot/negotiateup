### Genomics Platform Engineer | Illumina Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Genomics/Sequencing Dominant / Specialized Biotech Comp / RSU + Bonus / San Diego HQ | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+10-20% GENOMICS PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego CA | $155K–$210K | $70K–$180K/4yr | 12–18% | $205K–$320K |
| Bay Area CA | $160K–$215K | $75K–$185K/4yr | 12–18% | $215K–$330K |
| Remote US | $145K–$200K | $60K–$165K/4yr | 12–18% | $190K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Illumina ($20B market cap) dominates the global DNA sequencing market with approximately 80% market share. The Genomics Platform Engineer is Illumina's signature technical role — building the software platforms that process, analyze, and interpret genomic data from Illumina's sequencing instruments. This role combines software engineering with deep understanding of genomics data formats (FASTQ, BAM, VCF, CRAM), bioinformatics algorithms (alignment, variant calling, genome assembly), and the computational challenges of processing terabytes of sequencing data per run. Illumina's platform includes DRAGEN (its custom FPGA-accelerated bioinformatics processor), BaseSpace (cloud-based genomics analytics), and Connected Software (instrument control and data management). The genomics platform engineer works at the intersection of hardware (sequencers), embedded systems (instrument firmware), cloud computing (BaseSpace), and bioinformatics — a uniquely broad technical scope. Illumina's San Diego headquarters offers Southern California lifestyle with biotech compensation. [Source: Illumina Technology Strategy 2025, Illumina Annual Report 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Illumina Senior Platform Engineer = Google L4-L5 = Genentech Comp Bio = Pacific Biosciences Senior

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Genomics Platform Engineer at Illumina builds the software that reads the book of life:
- **80% Sequencing Market Share:** Illumina instruments generate the vast majority of the world's genomic data — your software processes it all
- **DRAGEN Platform:** Building on custom FPGA hardware that accelerates bioinformatics 10-100x vs CPU-only approaches
- **BaseSpace Cloud:** Building the cloud analytics platform where researchers and clinicians analyze genomic data
- **End-to-End Genomics:** From instrument firmware to cloud analytics — the most comprehensive genomics software stack in the world

**Global Levers**

1. **Market Dominance Frame:** "Illumina controls 80% of the global sequencing market. The platform I build processes the majority of the world's genomic data. This market-defining scope justifies top-of-band compensation."
2. **Genomics Engineering Scarcity:** "Engineers who combine production software engineering with deep genomics expertise (FASTQ/BAM/VCF, alignment algorithms, variant calling, genome assembly) are exceptionally rare. I'm not a general bioinformatics analyst — I build production genomics platforms."
3. **DRAGEN Hardware-Software Co-Design:** "Working on DRAGEN requires understanding both FPGA hardware acceleration and bioinformatics algorithms — a unique combination. This hardware-software co-design expertise commands a premium."
4. **San Diego Biotech Market:** "San Diego is a major biotech hub. Illumina competes with Thermo Fisher, Pacific Biosciences, 10x Genomics, and health tech companies for genomics engineering talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with RSUs at $160K/4yr and an 18% bonus target. My genomics platform engineering experience — building [sequencing analysis / bioinformatics pipelines / cloud genomics platforms] at [current company] — directly maps to Illumina's DRAGEN and BaseSpace development needs." Illumina will counter at $175K-$195K base with $90K-$140K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $270K. Push on RSU — Illumina stock has recovery upside potential. **Floor: $250K TC minimum for the signature genomics platform role.**
