**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Illumina protect genomic data — one of the most sensitive categories of personal data in existence. Genomic information is immutable (you can't change your genome), uniquely identifying, and reveals health predispositions, ancestry, and familial relationships. As genomic data becomes increasingly central to clinical care, the security stakes are rising. Illumina's security engineers protect BaseSpace cloud platform data, instrument connected software, clinical genomics applications (subject to HIPAA and IVD regulations), and intellectual property (sequencing technology, chemistry, algorithms). The role requires understanding of HIPAA, GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act), clinical lab regulations (CAP/CLIA), IVD cybersecurity requirements, and cloud security best practices.

**Level Mapping:** Illumina Security = Google L4 Security = Genentech Security = Moderna Security

**Global Levers**

1. **Genomic Data Sensitivity:** "Genomic data is the most sensitive category of personal data — immutable, uniquely identifying, and clinically consequential. The security mandate for this data justifies premium comp."
2. **San Diego Security Market:** "Security engineers in San Diego biotech command $190K-$300K TC."
3. **Clinical Genomics Compliance:** "I bring experience with HIPAA, GINA, CAP/CLIA, and IVD cybersecurity requirements for clinical genomics."
4. **ILMN Stock + Bonus Push:** "Target 18% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $200K with RSUs at $145K/4yr and an 18% bonus. My experience securing [genomic data / clinical platforms / biotech IP] directly addresses Illumina's highest-priority security needs." Illumina will counter at $165K-$190K base with $80K-$125K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $255K. Push on RSU and bonus.
