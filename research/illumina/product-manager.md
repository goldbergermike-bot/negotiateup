### Product Manager | Illumina Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Genomics/Sequencing Dominant / Specialized Biotech Comp / RSU + Bonus / Genomics Product Strategy

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego CA | $145K–$205K | $60K–$165K/4yr | 12–18% | $190K–$300K |
| Bay Area CA | $150K–$210K | $65K–$170K/4yr | 12–18% | $200K–$310K |
| Remote US | $135K–$190K | $55K–$155K/4yr | 12–18% | $175K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Illumina own the strategy and roadmap for genomics products — spanning instruments (NovaSeq, NextSeq, MiSeq), informatics platforms (BaseSpace, DRAGEN, Connected Software), clinical applications (TruSight, MiSeqDx), and developer tools (API ecosystem). The PM role at Illumina requires deep understanding of the genomics market: who the customers are (academic researchers, clinical labs, pharma R&D, agriculture), what workflows they perform, and how sequencing technology fits into their scientific and clinical pipelines. PMs at Illumina must balance research market needs (flexibility, innovation, new applications) with clinical market requirements (validation, regulatory compliance, reproducibility). The competitive landscape (Pacific Biosciences long-read, Oxford Nanopore portable sequencing) requires PMs to make strategic platform decisions. [Source: Illumina Product Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Illumina PM = Google L4-L5 PM = Genentech PM = Moderna PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Genomics Market Expertise:** "I bring deep understanding of the genomics market — research, clinical, and applied markets. This domain expertise shortens the PM productivity ramp significantly."
2. **San Diego PM Market:** "PMs in San Diego biotech command $190K-$300K TC."
3. **Clinical Genomics Product Complexity:** "Managing products that span research-use-only and IVD clinical applications requires regulatory product management expertise."
4. **Bonus + RSU Push:** "Target 18% bonus and top RSU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $200K with RSUs at $145K/4yr and an 18% bonus. My genomics product management experience directly maps to Illumina's product portfolio needs." Illumina will counter at $165K-$190K base with $80K-$125K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $255K. Push on bonus and RSU.
