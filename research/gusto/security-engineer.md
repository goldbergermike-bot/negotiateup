**Negotiation DNA**

Security engineers at Gusto protect some of the most sensitive data in the SMB ecosystem — Social Security numbers, bank account information, salary data, and tax filings for millions of workers. As of February 2026, Gusto maintains SOC 2 Type II certification, and the security team has expanded to approximately 20 engineers to support international expansion (GDPR, PIPEDA compliance), the Embedded API platform (third-party security assessments), and the AI payroll system (ML model security, data poisoning prevention).

Gusto's security comp carries a clear premium over standard SWE roles, reflecting the regulatory stakes. A security breach at Gusto would expose financial PII for millions of workers — the reputational and regulatory consequences would be existential. Security engineers with fintech or financial services experience, particularly those with expertise in SOC 2 compliance, data encryption at rest/in transit, and API security for platform products, command above-band compensation.

**Level Mapping:** Gusto Security Engineer = Google L4 Security = Meta E4 Security = Stripe Security Engineer

### Embedded API Security & International Compliance Lever
Gusto Embedded's expansion means third-party platforms access Gusto's payroll APIs, creating a dramatically expanded attack surface. The security team must build OAuth 2.0 frameworks, API rate limiting, partner security assessments, and real-time threat detection for 80+ platform partners. Simultaneously, international expansion requires compliance with GDPR, PIPEDA, and UK data protection regulations — each with distinct technical requirements.

Security engineers who have built API security frameworks for multi-tenant platforms are in critical demand. The intersection of platform security and financial data protection is a niche specialty, and Gusto is competing with Stripe, Plaid, and other fintech companies for this exact talent profile.

**Global Levers**
1. **PII Protection Scale:** "Gusto holds financial PII for millions of workers across 400,000+ businesses. A breach would be existential. My experience building defense-in-depth for financial PII at [Company] directly reduces Gusto's highest-severity risk."
2. **Platform Security Expertise:** "Gusto Embedded exposes APIs to 80+ third-party partners, dramatically expanding the attack surface. I've built multi-tenant API security frameworks at [Company] — that's exactly the expertise this role requires."
3. **International Compliance Premium:** "GDPR, PIPEDA, and UK data protection each have distinct technical requirements. I bring hands-on experience implementing all three, reducing Gusto's international compliance risk and accelerating market entry."
4. **ML Security Awareness:** "Gusto's AI payroll system introduces ML-specific security risks — data poisoning, model inversion, adversarial inputs. I bring specialized knowledge in ML security that few traditional security engineers possess."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Given the sensitivity of Gusto's financial data, the expanded Embedded API attack surface, and the international compliance requirements, this is a tier-one security role. I'm targeting $195K in RSUs over four years. My floor is $160K in equity, reflecting the fintech security premium and competitive offers from Stripe and Plaid."
