### Data Scientist | Gusto Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Forward / Analytics Premium | AI Payroll Intelligence & SMB Insights

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$200K | $120K–$200K | 10–15% | $220K–$300K |
| Denver | $145K–$180K | $100K–$170K | 10–15% | $195K–$265K |
| Toronto | C$150K–C$185K | C$95K–C$155K | 10–15% | C$195K–C$260K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data scientists at Gusto work on some of the richest payroll and employment datasets in the SMB sector — covering compensation benchmarks, employee turnover patterns, benefits utilization, and tax compliance across 400,000+ businesses. As of February 2026, Gusto's data science team has grown to approximately 25 data scientists, with the highest demand in the AI payroll automation and Gusto Insights product areas. Gusto recently launched "Gusto Insights," a data product that provides SMB owners with anonymized benchmarking data on compensation, benefits, and employee retention.

Gusto's data scientist comp is competitive with mid-tier tech companies, with equity representing significant upside given the IPO trajectory. The company values data scientists who can bridge statistical rigor with product intuition — you're expected to not just build models but to influence product decisions. If you bring experience with financial data, causal inference, or ML-powered product recommendations, expect above-band compensation. The payroll dataset's sensitivity (PII, financial data) also means Gusto seeks data scientists with strong data governance and privacy expertise.

### Gusto Insights Data Product Lever
Gusto Insights is a new revenue-generating data product that provides SMB benchmarking powered by aggregated, anonymized payroll data. The product launched in Q3 2025 and is already generating $15M+ in ARR, with projections to reach $50M+ by end of 2026. Data scientists building the models that power Gusto Insights are directly tied to this revenue line — a rare position for a DS role.

The Insights product requires sophisticated statistical methods: differential privacy for data anonymization, causal inference for compensation benchmarking, and time-series forecasting for turnover prediction. Data scientists who can build production-grade models that maintain privacy guarantees while delivering actionable business intelligence are in exceptionally high demand.

**Global Levers**
1. **Revenue-Generating DS Role:** "Unlike most DS roles, this position directly drives revenue through Gusto Insights. The product is on track for $50M+ ARR — my models will literally be the product. That revenue accountability should be reflected in equity."
2. **Privacy-First Data Expertise:** "Gusto's payroll data requires differential privacy and rigorous anonymization. My published research in privacy-preserving analytics directly reduces the regulatory risk of Gusto Insights."
3. **Compensation Benchmarking IP:** "Gusto's compensation benchmarking tool competes with Pave, Carta, and Radford. My experience building comp benchmarking models at [Company] gives me a direct head start."
4. **Causal Inference Premium:** "Gusto Insights' value proposition depends on causal claims — 'companies that offer X benefit see Y% lower turnover.' I bring rigorous causal inference expertise that ensures Gusto's data products are defensible."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Gusto Insights is a revenue-generating data product, and the data scientist building its models is directly accountable for a $50M+ ARR trajectory. I'd like the equity to reflect that product-level impact — I'm targeting $185K in RSUs over four years. My floor is $150K in equity, given the direct revenue tie and the privacy-first expertise this role requires."
