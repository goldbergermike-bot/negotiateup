**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions architects at Gusto bridge the gap between the platform engineering team and external partners who integrate Gusto Embedded payroll into their products. As of February 2026, Gusto Embedded has 80+ active platform partners, each requiring custom integration architecture, data mapping, and ongoing technical support. The SA role at Gusto is uniquely technical — you're not just advising on architecture, you're writing integration specifications and sometimes building reference implementations.

Gusto's SA comp reflects a hybrid sales-engineering model: strong base salary, meaningful equity, and a bonus component tied to partner onboarding success and integration quality metrics. SAs with experience in payroll/HR APIs, financial data integrations, or platform-as-a-service architectures command a premium. The role is also pivotal for Gusto's international expansion, as each new market requires adapting the Embedded API for country-specific payroll requirements.

**Level Mapping:** Gusto SA = Google L4-L5 SA = Stripe SA = AWS SA

### Embedded Partner Scaling Lever
Gusto Embedded's 2026 target is to onboard 40+ new platform partners while reducing average integration time from 12 weeks to 6 weeks. Solutions architects are the bottleneck for this goal — each partner requires a dedicated SA for architecture review, data mapping, and integration testing. Gusto currently has only 8-10 SAs for the Embedded program, meaning each new hire directly accelerates partner onboarding velocity.

The role carries direct revenue attribution: each Embedded partner generates an average of $2M+ in annual payroll volume through Gusto. An SA who onboards 5 partners in their first year has effectively created $10M+ in new annual payroll volume. This quantifiable revenue impact gives you strong negotiation leverage.

**Global Levers**
1. **Revenue Attribution:** "Each Embedded partner generates $2M+ in annual payroll volume. If I onboard 5 partners in my first year, that's $10M+ in new volume — my equity should reflect that direct revenue impact."
2. **Integration Acceleration:** "Gusto wants to cut integration time from 12 to 6 weeks. I've built integration accelerator frameworks at [Company] that achieved similar reductions — that capability directly doubles your partner onboarding capacity."
3. **International API Expertise:** "Gusto's international expansion requires adapting the Embedded API for each market's payroll regulations. I bring experience designing multi-jurisdiction financial APIs."
4. **Partner Retention Value:** "A great SA relationship is the #1 factor in partner retention. My partner satisfaction scores at [Company] were consistently 95%+ — that translates directly to reduced churn for Gusto Embedded."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Given the direct revenue attribution of the SA role — $10M+ in annual payroll volume per 5 partners onboarded — I'd like the equity to reflect that impact. I'm targeting $165K in RSUs over four years. My floor is $135K in equity, plus a bonus target at 18% of base."
