### Engineering Manager | Gusto Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Comp / Management Premium | AI Transformation & Team Scaling

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $200K–$245K | $180K–$300K | 15–20% | $295K–$400K |
| Denver | $180K–$220K | $150K–$260K | 15–20% | $260K–$355K |
| Toronto | C$185K–C$225K | C$140K–C$240K | 15–20% | C$255K–C$345K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering managers at Gusto lead teams of 6-10 engineers and own delivery for critical product areas — payroll processing, benefits administration, Gusto Embedded APIs, or the AI/ML platform. February 2026 is a pivotal moment: Gusto is simultaneously scaling its AI payroll automation, expanding internationally, and modernizing its platform architecture. EMs are expected to navigate all three priorities while maintaining the "zero-error payroll" bar that defines Gusto's engineering culture.

Gusto's EM comp is competitive but historically lagged the top of market by 10-15% compared to FAANG. However, the recent funding round and IPO trajectory have pushed comp bands upward. The bonus component (15-20% of base) is tied to team delivery metrics and company performance. Equity is your primary upside lever — Gusto's refreshes for high-performing EMs are generous, and the IPO timeline (speculated 2027-2028) gives your initial grant significant potential upside.

### AI-First Team Transformation Lever
Gusto's CEO has mandated that every engineering team integrate AI tooling into their development workflows by mid-2026, targeting a 30% productivity improvement. Engineering managers are on the front lines of this transformation — responsible for adopting AI pair programming tools, restructuring sprint processes around AI-assisted development, and reskilling team members. EMs who have successfully led AI adoption at previous companies are in high demand.

This mandate creates a unique negotiation angle: you're not just managing a team, you're leading an organizational transformation. The EM who successfully demonstrates a 30% productivity gain across their team becomes a model for the entire engineering org. Frame your experience with AI-augmented engineering workflows as a force multiplier.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Transformation Leadership:** "Gusto's AI productivity mandate requires EMs who have led similar transformations. I've implemented AI-assisted development workflows that delivered measurable productivity gains — that experience directly accelerates your timeline."
2. **Zero-Error Culture Premium:** "Managing a payroll engineering team means every release carries regulatory risk. My experience building deployment safety nets and compliance review processes at [Company] reduces that risk materially."
3. **International Scaling Expertise:** "Gusto's international expansion means building distributed teams across time zones. I've managed globally distributed engineering teams and know how to maintain velocity and quality across geographies."
4. **Retention Impact Frame:** "Engineering managers directly impact retention, and replacing a senior engineer costs $200K+ in recruiting and ramp time. My management philosophy and track record of low attrition saves Gusto real dollars."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant to reflect the dual mandate of this role — both team delivery and AI transformation leadership. I'm targeting $270K in RSUs over four years. My accept-at floor is $220K in equity, which accounts for the management premium and the AI transformation scope that goes beyond a standard EM role."
