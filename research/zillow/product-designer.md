**Negotiation DNA**

Zillow is the #1 real estate platform with 230M+ monthly unique users and 160M+ home listings, and Product Designers shape the user experience for Zillow's transformation from property search to AI Transaction Coordinator. Designers at Zillow create the interaction paradigms, visual systems, and conversational UX patterns for autonomous AI agents that guide buyers from discovery through closing preparation — making mortgage pre-approval, document coordination, inspection scheduling, and title preparation feel intuitive and trustworthy. The 35% Agentic Premium applies because Product Designers define how users interact with AI agents handling revenue-critical real estate transactions worth $400K+ each — trust, clarity, and usability in these interactions directly impact conversion rates and revenue per transaction.

**AI Transaction Coordinator — From Search to Closing Prep**

Zillow is evolving from a search engine to an AI Transaction Coordinator — autonomous AI agents that guide home buyers through the entire transaction process, from property discovery through closing preparation. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Closing Prep.' Product Designers creating the UX for this transformation should argue for the full 35% Agentic Premium because: (1) Zillow's AI agents handle the most complex consumer transaction — home buying (median $400K+). Each agent interaction is revenue-critical, touching mortgage leads, agent referrals, and closing services. (2) The shift from search to transaction coordination means AI agents handle document preparation, mortgage pre-approval guidance, inspection scheduling, title coordination, and closing prep — revenue-generating activities that previously required human agents. (3) Candidates should argue: 'I build AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects the financial complexity, regulatory requirements, and revenue-critical nature of autonomous real estate AI.' (4) Compare: search engineers optimize page views — Transaction Coordinator engineers optimize $400K+ closings. As a Product Designer, you design the trust frameworks, conversational interfaces, and transaction UX that determine whether buyers feel confident using AI agents for the largest financial decision of their lives. Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.
