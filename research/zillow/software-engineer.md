**Negotiation DNA**

Zillow is the #1 real estate platform in the United States with 230M+ monthly unique users and 160M+ home listings, and it is undergoing a transformative shift from property search to AI Transaction Coordinator — building autonomous AI agents that guide buyers from discovery through closing preparation, including mortgage pre-approval, document coordination, inspection scheduling, and title preparation. Software Engineers at Zillow are foundational to this transformation, building the core systems that power transaction-critical workflows where each AI agent interaction touches revenue streams worth $400K+ per home transaction. The 35% Agentic Premium applies because these engineers build the infrastructure that enables AI agents to handle revenue-critical real estate transactions — a fundamentally different value proposition than traditional search optimization.

**AI Transaction Coordinator — From Search to Closing Prep**

Zillow is evolving from a search engine to an AI Transaction Coordinator — autonomous AI agents that guide home buyers through the entire transaction process, from property discovery through closing preparation. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Closing Prep.' Software Engineers building these systems should argue for the full 35% Agentic Premium because: (1) Zillow's AI agents handle the most complex consumer transaction — home buying (median $400K+). Each agent interaction is revenue-critical, touching mortgage leads, agent referrals, and closing services. (2) The shift from search to transaction coordination means AI agents handle document preparation, mortgage pre-approval guidance, inspection scheduling, title coordination, and closing prep — revenue-generating activities that previously required human agents. (3) Candidates should argue: 'I build AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects the financial complexity, regulatory requirements, and revenue-critical nature of autonomous real estate AI.' (4) Compare: search engineers optimize page views — Transaction Coordinator engineers optimize $400K+ closings. As a Software Engineer, you are building the foundational services, APIs, and data pipelines that make autonomous transaction coordination possible at massive scale. Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Transaction-Critical AI:** "I'm building the core services that power AI Transaction Coordinators handling $400K+ real estate transactions.

The 35% premium reflects the financial stakes of each system I build."
2. **230M+ Monthly Users — Massive Scale:** "Zillow serves 230M+ monthly unique users across 160M+ listings. The engineering challenges at this scale — low-latency search, real-time pricing, concurrent transaction processing — require infrastructure expertise that commands premium compensation."
