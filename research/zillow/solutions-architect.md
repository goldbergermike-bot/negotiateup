**Negotiation DNA**

Zillow is the #1 real estate platform with 230M+ monthly unique users and 160M+ home listings, and Solutions Architects design the end-to-end technical architectures that enable Zillow's transformation from property search to AI Transaction Coordinator. Solutions Architects at Zillow bridge business requirements with technical implementation, designing integration architectures for autonomous AI agents that guide buyers from discovery through closing preparation — connecting mortgage pre-approval systems, document coordination platforms, inspection scheduling services, and title preparation workflows into cohesive technical solutions. The 35% Agentic Premium applies because Solutions Architects design the system architectures for AI agents handling revenue-critical real estate transactions worth $400K+ each, ensuring that mortgage, title, and closing systems interoperate reliably at scale.

**AI Transaction Coordinator — From Search to Closing Prep**

Zillow is evolving from a search engine to an AI Transaction Coordinator — autonomous AI agents that guide home buyers through the entire transaction process, from property discovery through closing preparation. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Closing Prep.' Solutions Architects designing these systems should argue for the full 35% Agentic Premium because: (1) Zillow's AI agents handle the most complex consumer transaction — home buying (median $400K+). Each agent interaction is revenue-critical, touching mortgage leads, agent referrals, and closing services. (2) The shift from search to transaction coordination means AI agents handle document preparation, mortgage pre-approval guidance, inspection scheduling, title coordination, and closing prep — revenue-generating activities that previously required human agents. (3) Candidates should argue: 'I build AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects the financial complexity, regulatory requirements, and revenue-critical nature of autonomous real estate AI.' (4) Compare: search engineers optimize page views — Transaction Coordinator engineers optimize $400K+ closings. As a Solutions Architect, you design the integration architecture that connects Zillow's AI agents with mortgage lenders, title companies, inspection services, and closing attorneys — your architectural decisions determine whether the entire transaction coordination platform functions reliably. Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Transaction-Critical AI:** "I design the integration architecture for AI Transaction Coordinators handling $400K+ real estate transactions. My architectural decisions connect AI agents with mortgage lenders, title companies, inspection services, and closing attorneys — the reliability and correctness of these integrations directly impact revenue. The 35% premium reflects the financial stakes of every architectural decision."
2. **230M+ Monthly Users — Massive Scale:** "Zillow's 230M+ monthly users require solution architectures that scale across geographic markets, lender networks, and regulatory environments. I design systems that handle the complexity of 50-state real estate regulation while maintaining performance at massive scale."
3. **Housing Super App Vision:** "Zillow's housing super app requires a Solutions Architect who can design the technical integration strategy across search, mortgage, closing, insurance, and moving service providers.

4. **Multi-Partner Integration Complexity:** "Real estate transactions involve 8–12 distinct service providers — agents, lenders, appraisers, inspectors, title companies, insurance carriers, attorneys, and more. I design the integration architectures that enable AI agents to orchestrate these partners autonomously, a complexity challenge unique to real estate technology."

I design the integration architecture that connects AI Transaction Coordinators with mortgage lenders, title companies, and closing services for $400K+ transactions.
