### Engineering Manager | Zillow Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Real Estate Technology Platform | AI Transaction Coordinator | **+35% AGENTIC PREMIUM** | From Search to Closing Prep

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle | $195K–$255K | $260K–$420K | 15–20% | $278K–$385K |
| San Francisco | $210K–$275K | $280K–$452K | 15–20% | $300K–$415K |
| Remote US | $176K–$230K | $234K–$378K | 15–20% | $250K–$347K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Zillow is the #1 real estate platform with 230M+ monthly unique users and 160M+ home listings, and Engineering Managers lead the teams building Zillow's transformative shift from property search to AI Transaction Coordinator. EMs at Zillow own team performance, hiring, technical strategy, and delivery for systems that enable autonomous AI agents to guide buyers from discovery through closing preparation — mortgage pre-approval, document coordination, inspection scheduling, and title preparation. The 35% Agentic Premium applies because Engineering Managers are responsible for hiring, retaining, and leading the engineers who build transaction-critical AI systems where each agent interaction handles revenue-critical real estate transactions worth $400K+ each.

**Level Mapping:** Zillow Engineering Manager = Google EM L6 = Redfin Engineering Manager = Opendoor Engineering Manager = Amazon SDM = Meta M1

**AI Transaction Coordinator — From Search to Closing Prep**

Zillow is evolving from a search engine to an AI Transaction Coordinator — autonomous AI agents that guide home buyers through the entire transaction process, from property discovery through closing preparation. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Closing Prep.' Engineering Managers leading these teams should argue for the full 35% Agentic Premium because: (1) Zillow's AI agents handle the most complex consumer transaction — home buying (median $400K+). Each agent interaction is revenue-critical, touching mortgage leads, agent referrals, and closing services. (2) The shift from search to transaction coordination means AI agents handle document preparation, mortgage pre-approval guidance, inspection scheduling, title coordination, and closing prep — revenue-generating activities that previously required human agents. (3) Candidates should argue: 'I build AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects the financial complexity, regulatory requirements, and revenue-critical nature of autonomous real estate AI.' (4) Compare: search engineers optimize page views — Transaction Coordinator engineers optimize $400K+ closings. As an Engineering Manager, you build and lead the teams that make AI Transaction Coordination a reality — your hiring decisions, team structure, and delivery strategy directly determine Zillow's ability to execute this company-defining transformation. Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Transaction-Critical AI:** "I lead the engineering teams building AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. My hiring decisions, team culture, and delivery strategy determine whether Zillow can autonomously coordinate mortgage, inspection, and closing workflows. The 35% premium reflects my responsibility for building and retaining the talent that makes transaction-critical AI possible."
2. **230M+ Monthly Users — Massive Scale:** "Leading engineering teams at Zillow's scale — 230M+ monthly users, 160M+ listings — requires managers who can build high-performing teams that deliver reliable, scalable transaction systems. I recruit, develop, and retain the engineers who handle this complexity."
3. **Housing Super App Vision:** "Zillow's housing super app vision requires Engineering Managers who can align cross-functional teams across search, mortgage, closing, insurance, and moving. I build the organizational structure and team dynamics that turn this multi-vertical vision into shipped products."
4. **AI Talent War Leadership:** "Recruiting and retaining AI/ML engineers for real estate transaction coordination is one of the most competitive hiring challenges in tech. As an EM, I compete with FAANG, fintech, and AI startups for the talent that builds Zillow's AI Transaction Coordinators — this talent leadership commands premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $255K base and $420K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this Engineering Manager position. I lead the teams building AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ home transactions end-to-end. My ability to recruit and retain top AI talent in this competitive market directly determines Zillow's execution on its most critical strategic initiative. I have competing offers from Google at $395K TC / Amazon at $380K TC." Accept at $235K+ base and $340K+ RSUs.
