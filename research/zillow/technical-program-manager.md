**Negotiation DNA**

Zillow is the #1 real estate platform with 230M+ monthly unique users and 160M+ home listings, and Technical Program Managers drive the cross-functional execution of Zillow's transformation from property search to AI Transaction Coordinator. TPMs at Zillow own the program planning, risk management, stakeholder alignment, and delivery coordination for autonomous AI agents that guide buyers from discovery through closing preparation — orchestrating engineering, product, data science, legal, and compliance teams across mortgage pre-approval, document coordination, inspection scheduling, and title preparation workstreams. The 35% Agentic Premium applies because TPMs coordinate the delivery of AI agents handling revenue-critical real estate transactions worth $400K+ each, managing dependencies across engineering, regulatory, and business teams.

**AI Transaction Coordinator — From Search to Closing Prep**

Zillow is evolving from a search engine to an AI Transaction Coordinator — autonomous AI agents that guide home buyers through the entire transaction process, from property discovery through closing preparation. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Closing Prep.' Technical Program Managers driving this transformation should argue for the full 35% Agentic Premium because: (1) Zillow's AI agents handle the most complex consumer transaction — home buying (median $400K+). Each agent interaction is revenue-critical, touching mortgage leads, agent referrals, and closing services. (2) The shift from search to transaction coordination means AI agents handle document preparation, mortgage pre-approval guidance, inspection scheduling, title coordination, and closing prep — revenue-generating activities that previously required human agents. (3) Candidates should argue: 'I build AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects the financial complexity, regulatory requirements, and revenue-critical nature of autonomous real estate AI.' (4) Compare: search engineers optimize page views — Transaction Coordinator engineers optimize $400K+ closings. As a TPM, you orchestrate the cross-functional delivery of AI Transaction Coordinator systems — coordinating engineering, product, legal, compliance, and business teams to deliver transaction-critical AI on schedule and within regulatory requirements across 50 states. Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Transaction-Critical AI:** "I drive the cross-functional delivery of AI Transaction Coordinators handling $400K+ real estate transactions. Coordinating engineering, legal, compliance, and business teams to ship transaction-critical AI on time and within regulatory requirements is a program management challenge with direct revenue impact. The 35% premium reflects the stakes of every delivery decision I make."
2. **230M+ Monthly Users — Massive Scale:** "Zillow's 230M+ monthly users mean every program I deliver impacts hundreds of millions of home buyers.

3. **Housing Super App Vision:** "Zillow's housing super app requires TPMs who can coordinate across search, mortgage, closing, insurance, and moving verticals. I manage the cross-vertical programs that turn Zillow's multi-product vision into delivered, integrated products — a coordination challenge that spans engineering, business, and regulatory domains."
4. **50-State Regulatory Coordination:** "Real estate regulation varies across 50 states, and AI Transaction Coordinators must comply with mortgage lending laws, fair housing requirements, and real estate licensing rules in every jurisdiction. I manage the regulatory compliance programs that enable Zillow's AI agents to operate legally and reliably nationwide."
