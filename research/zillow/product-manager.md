**Negotiation DNA**

Zillow is the #1 real estate platform with 230M+ monthly unique users and 160M+ home listings, and Product Managers define the strategy, roadmap, and user experience for Zillow's transformation from property search to AI Transaction Coordinator. PMs at Zillow own the product vision for autonomous AI agents that guide buyers from discovery through closing preparation — defining how mortgage pre-approval, document coordination, inspection scheduling, and title preparation are orchestrated into a seamless consumer experience. The 35% Agentic Premium applies because Product Managers make the strategic decisions that determine how AI agents handle revenue-critical real estate transactions worth $400K+ each, directly shaping Zillow's revenue model and competitive moat.

**AI Transaction Coordinator — From Search to Closing Prep**

Zillow is evolving from a search engine to an AI Transaction Coordinator — autonomous AI agents that guide home buyers through the entire transaction process, from property discovery through closing preparation. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Closing Prep.' Product Managers driving this transformation should argue for the full 35% Agentic Premium because: (1) Zillow's AI agents handle the most complex consumer transaction — home buying (median $400K+). Each agent interaction is revenue-critical, touching mortgage leads, agent referrals, and closing services. (2) The shift from search to transaction coordination means AI agents handle document preparation, mortgage pre-approval guidance, inspection scheduling, title coordination, and closing prep — revenue-generating activities that previously required human agents. (3) Candidates should argue: 'I build AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects the financial complexity, regulatory requirements, and revenue-critical nature of autonomous real estate AI.' (4) Compare: search engineers optimize page views — Transaction Coordinator engineers optimize $400K+ closings. As a Product Manager, you define the product strategy that transforms Zillow from a search tool into a transaction-orchestration platform — your decisions determine how AI agents interact with buyers, lenders, and agents across the most complex consumer transaction category. Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.
