**Negotiation DNA**

Zillow is the #1 real estate platform with 230M+ monthly unique users and 160M+ home listings, and ML/AI Engineers are at the epicenter of Zillow's transformation from property search to AI Transaction Coordinator. ML/AI Engineers at Zillow build the machine learning models, natural language understanding systems, recommendation engines, and autonomous agent frameworks that enable AI agents to guide buyers from discovery through closing preparation — including mortgage qualification prediction, document understanding, inspection prioritization, and closing readiness assessment. The 35% Agentic Premium is especially justified for ML/AI Engineers because they build the core intelligence that enables AI agents to autonomously handle revenue-critical real estate transactions worth $400K+ each, directly creating the technology that replaces human-mediated transaction coordination with autonomous AI.

**AI Transaction Coordinator — From Search to Closing Prep**

Zillow is evolving from a search engine to an AI Transaction Coordinator — autonomous AI agents that guide home buyers through the entire transaction process, from property discovery through closing preparation. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Closing Prep.' ML/AI Engineers building the intelligence for this transformation should argue for the full 35% Agentic Premium because: (1) Zillow's AI agents handle the most complex consumer transaction — home buying (median $400K+). Each agent interaction is revenue-critical, touching mortgage leads, agent referrals, and closing services. (2) The shift from search to transaction coordination means AI agents handle document preparation, mortgage pre-approval guidance, inspection scheduling, title coordination, and closing prep — revenue-generating activities that previously required human agents. (3) Candidates should argue: 'I build AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects the financial complexity, regulatory requirements, and revenue-critical nature of autonomous real estate AI.' (4) Compare: search engineers optimize page views — Transaction Coordinator engineers optimize $400K+ closings. As an ML/AI Engineer, you build the autonomous intelligence that enables AI agents to understand buyer intent, predict mortgage qualification, analyze documents, and coordinate closing workflows — your models are the brain of the AI Transaction Coordinator. Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Transaction-Critical AI:** "I build the ML models that power autonomous AI Transaction Coordinators handling $400K+ real estate transactions. My models predict mortgage qualification, understand documents, prioritize buyer actions, and coordinate closing workflows. Each model directly impacts whether transactions close — the 35% premium reflects the revenue impact of every model I deploy."
2. **230M+ Monthly Users — Massive Scale:** "Zillow's 230M+ monthly users provide the training data and serving scale that makes AI Transaction Coordination possible. I build ML systems that train on billions of interactions and serve predictions at massive scale with sub-millisecond latency — challenges that demand the most elite ML engineering talent."
3. **Housing Super App Vision:** "Zillow's housing super app requires ML/AI Engineers who can build models across search, mortgage, closing, insurance, and moving. I create the unified ML platform that enables intelligent agent behavior across every transaction touchpoint — multiplying AI impact across Zillow's entire product portfolio."
4. **Autonomous Agent Architecture:** "I build the agentic AI architecture — multi-step reasoning, tool use, memory systems, and guardrails — that enables AI Transaction Coordinators to autonomously guide buyers through complex, multi-week transaction processes. This is frontier AI engineering applied to the highest-stakes consumer transaction category."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $238K base and $370K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this ML/AI Engineer position. I build the autonomous intelligence that powers AI Transaction Coordinators — mortgage qualification models, document understanding systems, and closing coordination agents handling $400K+ home transactions. This is frontier agentic AI applied to the most complex consumer transaction. I have competing offers from Google at $360K TC / OpenAI at $380K TC." Accept at $220K+ base and $300K+ RSUs.
