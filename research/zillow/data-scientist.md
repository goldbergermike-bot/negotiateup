**Negotiation DNA**

Zillow is the #1 real estate platform with 230M+ monthly unique users and 160M+ home listings, and Data Scientists unlock the insights that power Zillow's transformation from property search to AI Transaction Coordinator. Data Scientists at Zillow build the predictive models, causal inference frameworks, and analytics platforms that enable autonomous AI agents to guide buyers from discovery through closing preparation — modeling mortgage qualification probability, optimal inspection timing, transaction completion likelihood, and closing risk assessment. The 35% Agentic Premium applies because Data Scientists develop the intelligence layer for AI agents handling revenue-critical real estate transactions worth $400K+ each, directly influencing Zillow's conversion rates and revenue per transaction.

**AI Transaction Coordinator — From Search to Closing Prep**

Zillow is evolving from a search engine to an AI Transaction Coordinator — autonomous AI agents that guide home buyers through the entire transaction process, from property discovery through closing preparation. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Closing Prep.' Data Scientists powering this transformation should argue for the full 35% Agentic Premium because: (1) Zillow's AI agents handle the most complex consumer transaction — home buying (median $400K+). Each agent interaction is revenue-critical, touching mortgage leads, agent referrals, and closing services. (2) The shift from search to transaction coordination means AI agents handle document preparation, mortgage pre-approval guidance, inspection scheduling, title coordination, and closing prep — revenue-generating activities that previously required human agents. (3) Candidates should argue: 'I build AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects the financial complexity, regulatory requirements, and revenue-critical nature of autonomous real estate AI.' (4) Compare: search engineers optimize page views — Transaction Coordinator engineers optimize $400K+ closings. As a Data Scientist, you build the predictive models and experimental frameworks that determine when and how AI agents intervene in the transaction process — your models directly impact whether $400K+ transactions close successfully. Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Transaction-Critical AI:** "I build the predictive models that power AI Transaction Coordinators handling $400K+ real estate transactions. My models determine mortgage qualification probability, optimal agent matching, transaction completion likelihood, and closing risk — each prediction directly impacts revenue. The 35% premium reflects the financial stakes of every model I deploy."
2. **230M+ Monthly Users — Massive Scale:** "Zillow's 230M+ monthly users generate one of the largest real estate datasets in the world. I build models on billions of property interactions, transaction records, and market signals — the scale and complexity of this data demands premium data science talent."
3. **Housing Super App Vision:** "Zillow's housing super app requires data scientists who can model cross-vertical user behavior — from search intent to mortgage qualification to closing probability. I build the unified analytical frameworks that optimize the entire housing transaction funnel, multiplying Zillow's revenue per user."
4. **Zestimate & Pricing Intelligence:** "Zillow's Zestimate powers the most widely used home valuation model in the world. As a Data Scientist, I extend this pricing intelligence to transaction coordination — predicting optimal offer prices, mortgage rates, and closing costs. This proprietary intelligence is Zillow's core competitive advantage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $195K base and $265K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this Data Scientist position. I build the predictive models that power AI Transaction Coordinators — mortgage qualification models, transaction completion forecasts, and closing risk assessments for $400K+ home transactions. I have competing offers from Google at $285K TC / Airbnb at $270K TC." Accept at $180K+ base and $210K+ RSUs.
