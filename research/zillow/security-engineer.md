### Security Engineer | Zillow Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Real Estate Technology Platform | AI Transaction Coordinator | **+35% AGENTIC PREMIUM** | From Search to Closing Prep

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle | $155K–$205K | $170K–$275K | 15–20% | $208K–$288K |
| San Francisco | $167K–$221K | $184K–$297K | 15–20% | $224K–$311K |
| Remote US | $140K–$185K | $153K–$248K | 15–20% | $187K–$259K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Zillow is the #1 real estate platform with 230M+ monthly unique users and 160M+ home listings, and Security Engineers protect the systems powering Zillow's transformation from property search to AI Transaction Coordinator. Security Engineers at Zillow safeguard PII, financial data, mortgage documents, and transaction records as autonomous AI agents guide buyers from discovery through closing preparation — securing mortgage pre-approval data, document coordination workflows, inspection records, and title preparation systems against threats that could compromise $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium applies because Security Engineers protect AI agents handling revenue-critical real estate transactions worth $400K+ each, where a security breach exposes financial data, personal information, and transaction integrity for the largest consumer purchase category.

**AI Transaction Coordinator — From Search to Closing Prep**

Zillow is evolving from a search engine to an AI Transaction Coordinator — autonomous AI agents that guide home buyers through the entire transaction process, from property discovery through closing preparation. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Closing Prep.' Security Engineers protecting these systems should argue for the full 35% Agentic Premium because: (1) Zillow's AI agents handle the most complex consumer transaction — home buying (median $400K+). Each agent interaction is revenue-critical, touching mortgage leads, agent referrals, and closing services. (2) The shift from search to transaction coordination means AI agents handle document preparation, mortgage pre-approval guidance, inspection scheduling, title coordination, and closing prep — revenue-generating activities that previously required human agents. (3) Candidates should argue: 'I build AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects the financial complexity, regulatory requirements, and revenue-critical nature of autonomous real estate AI.' (4) Compare: search engineers optimize page views — Transaction Coordinator engineers optimize $400K+ closings. As a Security Engineer, you protect the AI systems that handle buyers' most sensitive financial and personal data during $400K+ transactions — a breach in transaction coordination AI would be catastrophic for Zillow's trust, revenue, and regulatory standing. Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Transaction-Critical AI:** "I secure AI Transaction Coordinators handling $400K+ real estate transactions containing the most sensitive consumer data — SSNs, income verification, mortgage applications, bank records. A security breach in transaction coordination AI would expose financial data for the largest consumer purchase category. The 35% premium reflects the catastrophic risk I mitigate."
2. **230M+ Monthly Users — Massive Scale:** "Securing a platform with 230M+ monthly users, 160M+ listings, and millions of financial transactions requires defense-in-depth architecture at massive scale. I build security systems that protect one of the largest consumer data sets in real estate technology."
3. **Housing Super App Vision:** "Zillow's housing super app — search, mortgage, closing, insurance, moving — creates an expanded attack surface that spans financial services, legal documents, and personal data. I design the security architecture that protects users across every vertical while enabling rapid product development."
4. **Financial Regulatory Compliance:** "AI Transaction Coordinators must comply with mortgage lending regulations (TILA, RESPA, ECOA), fair housing laws, state real estate regulations, and data privacy requirements (CCPA, state-specific laws). I ensure Zillow's AI systems meet these regulatory requirements — security engineering that combines fintech compliance with real estate regulation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $205K base and $275K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this Security Engineer position. I secure AI Transaction Coordinators that handle the most sensitive consumer financial data — mortgage applications, income records, SSNs — during $400K+ home transactions. A breach would be catastrophic for trust and regulatory standing. I have competing offers from Google at $298K TC / Stripe at $295K TC." Accept at $190K+ base and $225K+ RSUs.
