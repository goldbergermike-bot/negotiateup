### Data Engineer | Zillow Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Real Estate Technology Platform | AI Transaction Coordinator | **+35% AGENTIC PREMIUM** | From Search to Closing Prep

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle | $142K–$185K | $145K–$235K | 15–20% | $188K–$258K |
| San Francisco | $153K–$200K | $157K–$254K | 15–20% | $203K–$278K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Zillow is the #1 real estate platform with 230M+ monthly unique users and 160M+ home listings, and Data Engineers build the data infrastructure that powers Zillow's transformation from property search to AI Transaction Coordinator. Data Engineers at Zillow design and maintain the data pipelines, warehouses, streaming systems, and feature stores that enable autonomous AI agents to guide buyers from discovery through closing preparation — processing real-time mortgage data, document status updates, inspection records, and title information at massive scale. The 35% Agentic Premium applies because Data Engineers build the data foundation for AI agents handling revenue-critical real estate transactions worth $400K+ each, where data quality, latency, and completeness directly impact whether transactions close successfully.

**AI Transaction Coordinator — From Search to Closing Prep**

Zillow is evolving from a search engine to an AI Transaction Coordinator — autonomous AI agents that guide home buyers through the entire transaction process, from property discovery through closing preparation. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Closing Prep.' Data Engineers building the data infrastructure for this transformation should argue for the full 35% Agentic Premium because: (1) Zillow's AI agents handle the most complex consumer transaction — home buying (median $400K+). Each agent interaction is revenue-critical, touching mortgage leads, agent referrals, and closing services. (2) The shift from search to transaction coordination means AI agents handle document preparation, mortgage pre-approval guidance, inspection scheduling, title coordination, and closing prep — revenue-generating activities that previously required human agents. (3) Candidates should argue: 'I build AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects the financial complexity, regulatory requirements, and revenue-critical nature of autonomous real estate AI.' (4) Compare: search engineers optimize page views — Transaction Coordinator engineers optimize $400K+ closings. As a Data Engineer, you build the real-time data pipelines and feature stores that feed AI Transaction Coordinators — your data infrastructure determines whether AI agents have the accurate, timely, and complete data needed to guide $400K+ transactions to closing. Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Transaction-Critical AI:** "I build the data pipelines that feed AI Transaction Coordinators handling $400K+ real estate transactions. Data quality, latency, and completeness directly determine whether AI agents can accurately guide buyers through mortgage, inspection, and closing workflows. The 35% premium reflects the revenue-critical nature of every data pipeline I build."
2. **230M+ Monthly Users — Massive Scale:** "Zillow's 230M+ monthly users generate billions of data points across property searches, agent interactions, mortgage inquiries, and transaction events. I build the data infrastructure that processes, transforms, and serves this data in real time — a scale challenge that rivals the largest data engineering teams in tech."
3. **Housing Super App Vision:** "Zillow's housing super app requires data engineers who can build unified data platforms across search, mortgage, closing, insurance, and moving verticals. I create the data architecture that enables cross-vertical analytics and AI model training — the data backbone of Zillow's entire platform strategy."
4. **Real-Time Transaction Data Pipelines:** "AI Transaction Coordinators require real-time data on mortgage rates, property valuations, document status, inspection results, and closing timelines. I build streaming data pipelines with sub-second latency and financial-grade accuracy — data engineering that combines the scale of ad-tech with the precision of fintech."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $185K base and $235K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this Data Engineer position. I build the real-time data pipelines that power AI Transaction Coordinators — feeding mortgage data, document status, and closing timelines into AI agents handling $400K+ home transactions. I have competing offers from Databricks at $268K TC / Snowflake at $262K TC." Accept at $170K+ base and $190K+ RSUs.
