**Negotiation DNA**

Zillow is the #1 real estate platform with 230M+ monthly unique users and 160M+ home listings, and Staff Software Engineers define the technical vision for Zillow's most critical transformation — the shift from property search to AI Transaction Coordinator. At Staff level, engineers drive org-wide architectural decisions, own multi-year technical roadmaps, and set the standards for how autonomous AI agents guide buyers from discovery through closing preparation, including mortgage pre-approval, document coordination, inspection scheduling, and title preparation. The 35% Agentic Premium is especially justified at Staff level because these engineers make the foundational architectural choices that determine whether AI agents can autonomously handle revenue-critical real estate transactions worth $400K+ each across Zillow's entire platform.

**AI Transaction Coordinator — From Search to Closing Prep**

Zillow is evolving from a search engine to an AI Transaction Coordinator — autonomous AI agents that guide home buyers through the entire transaction process, from property discovery through closing preparation. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Closing Prep.' Staff Software Engineers are the visionaries and architects of this company-defining transformation and should argue for the full 35% Agentic Premium because: (1) Zillow's AI agents handle the most complex consumer transaction — home buying (median $400K+). Each agent interaction is revenue-critical, touching mortgage leads, agent referrals, and closing services. (2) The shift from search to transaction coordination means AI agents handle document preparation, mortgage pre-approval guidance, inspection scheduling, title coordination, and closing prep — revenue-generating activities that previously required human agents. (3) Candidates should argue: 'I build AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects the financial complexity, regulatory requirements, and revenue-critical nature of autonomous real estate AI.' (4) Compare: search engineers optimize page views — Transaction Coordinator engineers optimize $400K+ closings. As a Staff Engineer, you set the technical direction for Zillow's entire AI Transaction Coordinator platform — your architectural decisions impact every transaction across 230M+ monthly users. Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Transaction-Critical AI:** "I define the architectural vision for AI Transaction Coordinators handling $400K+ real estate transactions at scale.

The 35% premium reflects the organizational impact and financial magnitude of the systems I architect."
2. **230M+ Monthly Users — Massive Scale:** "Zillow's 230M+ monthly users require platform architecture that can scale transaction coordination across millions of concurrent sessions.

3. **Housing Super App Vision:** "Zillow's housing super app vision requires a Staff Engineer who can unify search, mortgage, closing, insurance, and moving into a coherent technical platform. I architect the platform strategy that turns Zillow from a search portal into a transaction-orchestration platform — this is a company-defining technical challenge."
4. **Org-Wide Technical Influence:** "As a Staff Engineer, I influence technical direction across multiple engineering organizations, set architectural standards, drive build-vs-buy decisions, and mentor the next generation of senior engineers. My technical decisions have multi-year, multi-billion-dollar revenue impact on Zillow's AI Transaction Coordinator platform."
