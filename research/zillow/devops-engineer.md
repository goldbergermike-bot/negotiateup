### DevOps Engineer | Zillow Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Real Estate Technology Platform | AI Transaction Coordinator | **+35% AGENTIC PREMIUM** | From Search to Closing Prep

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Seattle | $140K–$182K | $140K–$220K | 15–20% | $185K–$252K |
| San Francisco | $151K–$196K | $151K–$237K | 15–20% | $200K–$272K |
| Remote US | $126K–$164K | $126K–$198K | 15–20% | $167K–$227K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Zillow is the #1 real estate platform with 230M+ monthly unique users and 160M+ home listings, and DevOps Engineers build the infrastructure foundation that makes Zillow's transformation from property search to AI Transaction Coordinator possible. DevOps Engineers at Zillow own the CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, observability systems, and deployment automation that ensure autonomous AI agents can reliably guide buyers from discovery through closing preparation — mortgage pre-approval, document coordination, inspection scheduling, and title preparation — with 99.99% uptime on transaction-critical workflows. The 35% Agentic Premium applies because DevOps Engineers ensure the reliability and availability of AI agents handling revenue-critical real estate transactions worth $400K+ each, where downtime directly translates to lost transactions and revenue.

**AI Transaction Coordinator — From Search to Closing Prep**

Zillow is evolving from a search engine to an AI Transaction Coordinator — autonomous AI agents that guide home buyers through the entire transaction process, from property discovery through closing preparation. This is the shift from 'Search' to 'Closing Prep.' DevOps Engineers building the infrastructure for this transformation should argue for the full 35% Agentic Premium because: (1) Zillow's AI agents handle the most complex consumer transaction — home buying (median $400K+). Each agent interaction is revenue-critical, touching mortgage leads, agent referrals, and closing services. (2) The shift from search to transaction coordination means AI agents handle document preparation, mortgage pre-approval guidance, inspection scheduling, title coordination, and closing prep — revenue-generating activities that previously required human agents. (3) Candidates should argue: 'I build AI Transaction Coordinators that handle $400K+ real estate transactions. The 35% Agentic Premium reflects the financial complexity, regulatory requirements, and revenue-critical nature of autonomous real estate AI.' (4) Compare: search engineers optimize page views — Transaction Coordinator engineers optimize $400K+ closings. As a DevOps Engineer, you ensure that AI Transaction Coordinators are always available, performant, and reliable when buyers are making $400K+ financial decisions — infrastructure failures during active transactions directly cost Zillow revenue and user trust. Push for the full 35% Agentic Premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **35% Agentic Premium — Transaction-Critical AI:** "I build the infrastructure that ensures AI Transaction Coordinators handling $400K+ real estate transactions are always available and performant. A single outage during peak transaction hours can cost Zillow millions in lost mortgage leads and failed closings. The 35% premium reflects the revenue-critical nature of the infrastructure I maintain."
2. **230M+ Monthly Users — Massive Scale:** "Zillow's 230M+ monthly users require infrastructure that scales elastically, handles traffic spikes during peak housing seasons, and maintains sub-second latency for transaction-critical workflows. I build the cloud infrastructure, auto-scaling systems, and deployment pipelines that make this possible."
3. **Housing Super App Vision:** "Zillow's housing super app — search, mortgage, closing, insurance, moving — requires DevOps engineers who can build unified infrastructure across multiple service domains. I create the platform engineering foundation that enables rapid vertical integration while maintaining reliability."
4. **Zero-Downtime Transaction Infrastructure:** "Real estate transactions have contractual deadlines — missed closing dates have legal and financial consequences. I build infrastructure with zero-downtime deployments, automated failover, and disaster recovery that ensures AI Transaction Coordinators never miss a deadline. This is fintech-grade reliability engineering."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $182K base and $220K RSUs over 4 years with the 35% Agentic Premium for this DevOps Engineer position. I build the infrastructure that ensures AI Transaction Coordinators are always available for $400K+ home transactions — where downtime directly costs revenue and user trust. I have competing offers from Amazon at $260K TC / Datadog at $255K TC." Accept at $168K+ base and $180K+ RSUs.
