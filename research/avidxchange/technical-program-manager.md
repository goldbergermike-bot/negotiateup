**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX) are the orchestrators of the company's most complex cross-functional initiatives — coordinating engineering, product, design, security, and compliance teams to deliver the platform capabilities that 8,800+ customers rely on. The role is especially critical during AvidXchange's strategic transformation: the shift from AP automation to Purposeful AI-powered financial operations requires TPMs who can manage the parallel execution of maintaining the AvidPay Network's reliability while shipping new Knowledge Discovery Enterprise Tier features on aggressive timelines.

The Charlotte NC hub is the coordination center for AvidXchange's largest programs, and TPMs based there have the broadest organizational visibility. With $420M+ in revenue and multiple verticals (real estate, HOA, construction) each demanding tailored functionality, the TPM must manage competing priorities across product lines while keeping the Purposeful AI transformation on track. This is a role where program execution directly translates to market position — AvidXchange's ability to ship Knowledge Discovery features before competitors determines whether the Enterprise Tier premium holds. The TPM ensures that AvidXchange's ambitious AI vision doesn't outpace its execution capacity.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Transformation Program Orchestrator:** "AvidXchange's Purposeful AI transformation is not a single-team effort — it requires coordinating engineering, data science, product, compliance, and customer success across multiple parallel workstreams. As the TPM leading this cross-functional execution, I'm the difference between shipping Knowledge Discovery on time and letting competitors close the gap. I'm requesting $165,000-$175,000 base in Charlotte to reflect the strategic scope of this program leadership."

**Lever 2 — Enterprise Tier Launch Program Owner:** "The Enterprise Tier launch is AvidXchange's most commercially important program in 2026-2027. As the TPM owning this launch, I'll be managing dependencies across the AvidPay Network, Knowledge Discovery features, security certifications, and customer onboarding for 8,800+ potential upsell accounts. I'm requesting $80,000-$100,000 in RSU/4yr because the success of this launch directly determines AVDX's revenue trajectory."

**Lever 3 — Multi-Vertical Coordination Complexity:** "AvidXchange's real estate, HOA, and construction verticals each have distinct regulatory timelines, integration requirements, and customer expectations. Managing Knowledge Discovery feature rollouts across all three verticals simultaneously requires TPM expertise that most B2B SaaS companies don't demand. I'd like a $12,000-$15,000 sign-on bonus reflecting this multi-vertical program complexity."

**Lever 4 — Charlotte Hub Program Culture:** "TPMs in the Charlotte hub set the cadence and accountability standards for the entire engineering organization. My program management discipline directly determines AvidXchange's shipping velocity for Purposeful AI features. I'd like a performance bonus target of 18-20% tied to Enterprise Tier program milestone delivery, rather than the standard 12-15% organizational target."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $170,000 base for Charlotte, $175,000 for Atlanta, or $165,000 remote. TPMs should frame themselves as the critical enabler of AvidXchange's Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier transformation — without program discipline, the Knowledge Discovery vision stays on the roadmap and never reaches customers. Push for $80,000-$100,000 RSU/4yr and an elevated bonus target of 18-20%. Your accept-at floor should be $155,000 base with $60,000 RSU/4yr. If base is capped, negotiate a $12,000-$15,000 sign-on and push for a milestone-based bonus tied to Enterprise Tier launch delivery dates. Always reference the multi-vertical complexity of managing programs across real estate, HOA, and construction simultaneously.
