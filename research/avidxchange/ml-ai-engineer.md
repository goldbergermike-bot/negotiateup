**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX) are the builders of the Purposeful AI intelligence layer — the models, algorithms, and inference systems that transform raw payment data into actionable financial intelligence. This is the role that makes the Knowledge Discovery Enterprise Tier real. AvidXchange's 8,800+ customers generate a proprietary dataset of mid-market financial behavior spanning real estate, HOA, and construction verticals, and the ML/AI Engineer turns this data into competitive advantages: invoice anomaly detection, payment timing optimization, supplier risk scoring, cash flow prediction, and intelligent approval routing.

The Charlotte NC hub is where AvidXchange is concentrating its AI engineering talent, building a center of excellence that can compete for ML engineers against the Bay Area, Seattle, and New York. With $420M+ in revenue and a strategic mandate to evolve from AP automation to AI-powered financial operations, the ML/AI Engineer is not a research role — you are building production ML systems that serve real customers through the AvidPay Network. The Purposeful AI framing is deliberate: AvidXchange wants AI that solves specific, high-value problems for mid-market finance teams, not general-purpose AI. This domain focus makes the ML/AI Engineer's work immediately monetizable through the Enterprise Tier premium.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — Purposeful AI Model Builder:** "I am joining AvidXchange to build the production ML models that power the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier. My work — invoice anomaly detection, payment prediction, supplier risk models — is literally the product that Knowledge Discovery sells. Every model I ship becomes a revenue-generating feature. I'm requesting $185,000-$195,000 base in Charlotte because this is not ML research; this is ML product engineering with direct revenue attribution."

**Lever 2 — AvidPay Network Intelligence Engine:** "The AvidPay Network's dual-sided payment data across 8,800+ customers is AvidXchange's most valuable strategic asset, and I'm the engineer who turns that data into intelligence. My models improve with network scale — every new customer and supplier makes the AI smarter. I'm requesting $100,000-$130,000 in RSU/4yr because my work creates compounding value tied directly to AVDX's growth and network expansion."

**Lever 3 — Charlotte AI Talent Premium:** "ML/AI Engineers with production fintech experience are extremely scarce in the Charlotte market. AvidXchange is competing for this talent against remote offers from FAANG companies and well-funded AI startups at $200,000+ base. I'm choosing Charlotte and AvidXchange because of the Purposeful AI mission, but I need compensation that reflects the market reality. I'd like a $18,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus to bridge the gap between Charlotte-adjusted comp and the national ML market."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise Tier Knowledge Discovery Revenue Share:** "Every Knowledge Discovery feature I build — from cash flow prediction to intelligent approval routing — directly drives Enterprise Tier adoption and upsell revenue. I'd like a performance bonus target of 20-25% tied to Enterprise Tier AI feature adoption rates and model performance metrics, recognizing that my production ML work is the primary differentiator between AvidXchange's standard and Enterprise tiers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** ML/AI Engineers are AvidXchange's highest-demand technical role, and you should negotiate accordingly. Anchor at $190,000 base for Charlotte, $195,000 for Atlanta, or $185,000 remote. Push hard on RSU/4yr: target $100,000-$130,000, framing equity around the compounding value of AvidPay Network intelligence. Your accept-at floor should be $170,000 base with $80,000 RSU/4yr. Frame every negotiation point around the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier: you are building the models that ARE the Knowledge Discovery product. If base is capped, push for a $20,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus, accelerated RSU vesting (30% year one), and a performance bonus of 20-25% tied to AI feature revenue. Emphasize the Charlotte AI talent scarcity — AvidXchange must pay a premium to attract ML talent to the hub.
