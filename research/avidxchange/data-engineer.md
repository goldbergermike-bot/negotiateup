**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX) build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers every aspect of the company's platform — from real-time payment processing analytics to the batch pipelines that feed Knowledge Discovery models. With 8,800+ customers across real estate, HOA, and construction verticals generating continuous streams of invoice, payment, approval, and supplier data, the Data Engineer manages one of the richest financial datasets in mid-market fintech. The AvidPay Network alone produces dual-sided payment data (buyer behavior and supplier acceptance patterns) that requires sophisticated data engineering to normalize, transform, and make available for both operational analytics and Purposeful AI model training.

The Charlotte NC hub is AvidXchange's data engineering center, where pipelines are designed to handle the scale and complexity of multi-vertical financial data. With $420M+ in revenue and an aggressive push toward the Enterprise Tier, Data Engineers are building the foundation that makes Knowledge Discovery possible — without clean, reliable, well-modeled data, the Purposeful AI vision is just a slide deck. This role sits at the intersection of reliability engineering and AI enablement: you must ensure that the data flowing through AvidXchange's systems is both operationally sound and ML-ready, serving the dual needs of day-to-day AP automation and the emerging intelligence layer.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — Knowledge Discovery Data Foundation:** "The Knowledge Discovery capabilities in the Enterprise Tier are only as good as the data infrastructure underneath them. As a Data Engineer, I'm building the pipelines that transform raw payment data from 8,800+ customers into the clean, feature-rich datasets that power Purposeful AI. Without my work, Knowledge Discovery doesn't exist. I'm requesting $160,000-$170,000 base in Charlotte to reflect the foundational nature of this role."

**Lever 2 — AvidPay Network Data Architecture:** "The AvidPay Network generates dual-sided payment data — buyer workflows and supplier acceptance patterns — that no competitor can replicate. As the Data Engineer responsible for this network's data architecture, I'm designing the schemas, pipelines, and data models that turn raw transaction data into competitive intelligence. I'm requesting $70,000-$90,000 in RSU/4yr because the data assets I create appreciate in value with every new customer and supplier on the network."

**Lever 3 — Multi-Vertical Data Normalization:** "Real estate management companies, HOA administrators, and construction firms each generate fundamentally different financial data structures. Building data pipelines that normalize this multi-vertical data into a unified format suitable for Knowledge Discovery is specialized work. I'd like a $10,000-$14,000 sign-on bonus reflecting the domain expertise required to engineer data infrastructure across AvidXchange's three core verticals."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise Tier ML Data Readiness:** "The Enterprise Tier's Purposeful AI features require ML-ready data — properly featurized, validated, and continuously updated training datasets. I'll be building the feature stores, data quality frameworks, and real-time streaming pipelines that make AI model training and inference possible. I'd like a performance bonus of 15-18% tied to data pipeline reliability metrics and Knowledge Discovery feature data readiness milestones."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $165,000 base for Charlotte, $170,000 for Atlanta, or $160,000 remote. Data Engineers should emphasize that they are building the foundation of the entire Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — Knowledge Discovery is impossible without reliable, well-engineered data pipelines. Push for $70,000-$90,000 RSU/4yr, framing equity as aligned with the growing value of AvidXchange's proprietary payment data assets. Your accept-at floor should be $145,000 base with $50,000 RSU/4yr. If base is capped, negotiate a $10,000-$14,000 sign-on bonus and push for a performance bonus tied to data pipeline SLAs and Knowledge Discovery data readiness. Frame yourself as the invisible enabler: without your data engineering, the AvidPay Network is just transactions, not intelligence.
