**Negotiation DNA**

AvidXchange is the dominant mid-market accounts payable automation platform, processing payments for 8,800+ customers across real estate, HOA, and construction verticals. As a Software Engineer, you are building the foundational systems that power the AvidPay Network — the supplier payment infrastructure that differentiates AvidXchange from legacy AP providers. With $420M+ in revenue and a strategic pivot toward Purposeful AI and full AI-powered financial operations, every engineer contributes directly to the company's Enterprise Tier transformation and its Knowledge Discovery roadmap.

The Charlotte NC hub serves as AvidXchange's center of gravity, and the company invests heavily in local talent while maintaining competitive remote compensation. The shift from pure AP automation to an intelligent financial operations platform means Software Engineers are not simply maintaining CRUD applications — they are building the data pipelines, API surfaces, and microservices architecture that will underpin the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier. This is a rare opportunity to join a publicly traded fintech (NASDAQ: AVDX) at the inflection point between workflow automation and AI-native financial intelligence, where Knowledge Discovery capabilities are being embedded into every product surface.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — Purposeful AI Foundation Builder:** "I'm joining AvidXchange at the exact moment the platform is shifting from AP automation to Purposeful AI-powered financial operations. My work on the core engineering stack will directly enable the Enterprise Tier's Knowledge Discovery capabilities. Given that I'll be building the foundational services that 8,800+ customers depend on, I'd like to discuss a base salary adjustment of $10,000-$15,000 to reflect the AI-adjacent complexity of this role."

**Lever 2 — AvidPay Network Scale Multiplier:** "The AvidPay Network processes billions in supplier payments, and as a Software Engineer contributing to its reliability and expansion, my impact scales across every transaction. I'd like to negotiate an additional RSU grant of $10,000-$15,000 to align my equity upside with the network effects I'll be helping to build from the Charlotte hub."

**Lever 3 — Charlotte Hub Cost-of-Living Anchor:** "Charlotte's tech market is rapidly maturing, and AvidXchange is competing for engineers against fintech startups and bank innovation labs. While Charlotte cost-of-living is favorable compared to SF or NYC, my offer should reflect the premium that mid-market AP automation expertise commands in the Southeast. I'm targeting a total compensation package that positions me at the 65th percentile for Charlotte-based fintech engineers."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise Tier Knowledge Discovery Upside:** "AvidXchange's Enterprise Tier strategy — particularly the Knowledge Discovery premium positioning — is what attracted me to this role. I want to be compensated not just for today's AP automation work, but for the AI-native financial operations platform I'll be building toward. I'd like to discuss a sign-on bonus of $8,000-$12,000 to bridge the gap between my current compensation and the strategic value of this Enterprise Tier transformation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a base salary increase of $10,000-$15,000 above initial offer, plus an additional $10,000 in RSU grants over four years. Use the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier transformation as your primary leverage — frame yourself as a builder of Knowledge Discovery infrastructure, not just an AP automation engineer. Your accept-at floor should be $130,000 base in Charlotte, $135,000 in Atlanta, or $125,000 remote, with minimum $30,000 in RSU/4yr. If the base is firm, push for a $10,000 sign-on bonus citing the Knowledge Discovery premium and the competitive Charlotte fintech market. Always anchor to the Enterprise Tier strategic shift.
