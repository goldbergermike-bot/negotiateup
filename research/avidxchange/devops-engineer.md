**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX) are the infrastructure backbone of a platform that processes mission-critical financial transactions for 8,800+ mid-market customers. The AvidPay Network, invoice processing pipelines, and AP automation workflows all run on infrastructure that must deliver five-nines availability — because payment delays in real estate, HOA, and construction verticals create cascading financial impacts for suppliers and buyers. As AvidXchange transforms into a Purposeful AI-powered financial operations platform, the DevOps role expands from traditional CI/CD and cloud management to building the scalable ML infrastructure that powers Knowledge Discovery.

The Charlotte NC hub concentrates AvidXchange's infrastructure engineering, and DevOps engineers there have the closest collaboration with security, platform, and SRE teams. With $420M+ in revenue and growing Enterprise Tier ambitions, the company needs DevOps engineers who can operate at two speeds simultaneously: maintaining the rock-solid reliability that existing AP automation customers expect, while building the elastic, GPU-capable infrastructure that the Purposeful AI Knowledge Discovery layer demands. This dual mandate makes the DevOps role at AvidXchange uniquely challenging and strategically important.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Infrastructure Architect:** "The Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier requires fundamentally different infrastructure than traditional AP automation — model serving, GPU compute, real-time inference pipelines, and vector databases for Knowledge Discovery. As a DevOps Engineer building this AI infrastructure layer, I'm enabling AvidXchange's entire strategic pivot. I'm requesting $155,000-$165,000 base in Charlotte to reflect the ML infrastructure expertise this role demands."

**Lever 2 — AvidPay Network Reliability Guardian:** "The AvidPay Network processes payments for 8,800+ customers, and infrastructure failures translate directly to delayed payments and damaged supplier relationships. As the DevOps Engineer responsible for network reliability, my work has measurable financial impact on every transaction. I'm requesting $60,000-$80,000 in RSU/4yr because uptime protection of the AvidPay Network is a direct stock-price risk factor."

**Lever 3 — Knowledge Discovery Platform Scaling:** "The Knowledge Discovery layer of the Enterprise Tier will generate inference workloads at a scale AvidXchange hasn't seen before — real-time anomaly detection across thousands of payment streams, predictive models running continuously, and data pipeline throughput that grows with every new customer. I'd like a $10,000-$15,000 sign-on bonus reflecting the specialized cloud-native and ML infrastructure skills required to scale this platform from the Charlotte hub."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise Tier SLA Ownership:** "Enterprise Tier customers will expect the highest availability SLAs, and my infrastructure work directly determines whether AvidXchange can deliver those commitments. I'd like a performance bonus of 15-18% tied to uptime metrics and infrastructure cost optimization — if I keep the platform running and reduce cloud spend, that directly flows to AvidXchange's margins."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $160,000 base for Charlotte, $165,000 for Atlanta, or $155,000 remote. DevOps Engineers should emphasize the dual mandate: maintaining AvidPay Network reliability for 8,800+ customers while building the new AI infrastructure for the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier. Push for $60,000-$80,000 RSU/4yr, framing equity around the reliability risk you manage. Your accept-at floor should be $145,000 base with $45,000 RSU/4yr. If base is capped, negotiate a $10,000-$15,000 sign-on and push for an infrastructure cost-savings bonus of 3-5% of documented annual cloud cost reductions. Frame yourself as the Knowledge Discovery infrastructure enabler — without scalable ML infrastructure, the Enterprise Tier cannot ship.
