**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX) solve one of the hardest design problems in B2B fintech: making complex AP automation workflows intuitive for mid-market finance teams who are not technology-first users. The 8,800+ customers across real estate, HOA, and construction verticals each bring domain-specific workflows, and the designer must create patterns that abstract this complexity without sacrificing power. As AvidXchange pushes into Purposeful AI and the Knowledge Discovery Enterprise Tier, the design challenge deepens — you must create interfaces that surface AI-generated insights in ways that finance professionals trust enough to act on.

The Charlotte NC hub is where AvidXchange's design team collaborates most closely with product management and engineering leadership. The AvidPay Network adds a supplier-side design surface — creating experiences for the other half of every payment transaction. With $420M+ in revenue and a transformation toward AI-powered financial operations, Product Designers are increasingly responsible for the user experience of Knowledge Discovery features: anomaly detection dashboards, predictive cash flow visualizations, and intelligent approval workflows. This is not consumer design — it is high-stakes enterprise fintech design where a confusing interface can delay millions in payments.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Trust Interface Designer:** "The Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier only succeeds if finance teams trust the Knowledge Discovery insights AvidXchange surfaces. That trust is fundamentally a design problem. I'll be designing the interfaces that make AI-generated financial intelligence legible and actionable for non-technical AP professionals. I'm requesting $145,000-$150,000 base in Charlotte because this is AI trust design, not standard SaaS UI work."

**Lever 2 — AvidPay Network Dual-Surface Design:** "The AvidPay Network requires designing for both buyers and suppliers — two fundamentally different user personas with opposing workflow needs. This dual-surface design complexity is rare in B2B fintech. I'm asking for $55,000-$70,000 in RSU/4yr to align my equity compensation with the network growth my design work enables across 8,800+ customers."

**Lever 3 — Knowledge Discovery Visualization Premium:** "The Knowledge Discovery features at the heart of the Enterprise Tier require sophisticated data visualization and interaction design — cash flow predictions, anomaly detection overlays, and intelligent approval workflows. I bring specialized expertise in financial data visualization that commands a premium in the Charlotte market. I'd like a $10,000-$12,000 sign-on bonus to reflect this specialized skill set."

**Lever 4 — Charlotte Hub Design Culture Builder:** "AvidXchange's Charlotte hub needs designers who can elevate the entire design culture — establishing design systems, accessibility standards, and AI interaction patterns that scale across verticals. I'd like a performance bonus target of 15% rather than the standard 10%, tied to Enterprise Tier feature adoption and user satisfaction metrics for Knowledge Discovery surfaces."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $145,000 base for Charlotte, $150,000 for Atlanta, or $140,000 remote. Product Designers should emphasize the unique complexity of designing AI trust interfaces for the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — this is not generic SaaS design, it is specialized financial intelligence visualization. Push for $55,000-$70,000 RSU/4yr. Your accept-at floor should be $130,000 base with $40,000 RSU/4yr. If base is capped, negotiate a $10,000-$12,000 sign-on bonus and push for a portfolio review bonus of $5,000 at the 6-month mark tied to Knowledge Discovery design system delivery. Always frame yourself as the designer who makes Purposeful AI trustworthy.
