**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX) sit at the exact center of the company's most valuable strategic asset: payment data intelligence. With 8,800+ customers processing invoices and payments through the platform across real estate, HOA, and construction verticals, AvidXchange accumulates an unmatched dataset of mid-market financial behavior. The Data Scientist role is where this raw data becomes the Knowledge Discovery insights that power the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — identifying payment anomalies, predicting cash flow patterns, benchmarking spending across industries, and surfacing actionable intelligence that AP teams cannot get anywhere else.

The Charlotte NC hub gives Data Scientists proximity to the product, engineering, and customer success teams that translate models into revenue. AvidXchange's AvidPay Network generates a rich supplier-side dataset — payment timing, acceptance rates, discount utilization — that creates a dual-sided intelligence picture unique in mid-market AP. With $420M+ in revenue and an aggressive push toward AI-powered financial operations, the Data Scientist is not a back-office analytics role; you are building the intelligence engine that justifies the Enterprise Tier premium and differentiates AvidXchange from competitors who offer automation without understanding.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — Knowledge Discovery Engine Builder:** "The Knowledge Discovery layer is the core differentiator of the Enterprise Tier — and as a Data Scientist, I'm the person building the analytical models that power it. My work on payment pattern analysis, anomaly detection, and industry benchmarking directly determines the value proposition that justifies premium pricing. I'm requesting $155,000-$165,000 base in Charlotte because this is revenue-generating data science, not reporting."

**Lever 2 — AvidPay Network Intelligence Premium:** "The AvidPay Network gives AvidXchange a dataset that no competitor can replicate — dual-sided payment behavior data spanning 8,800+ customers and their suppliers. As the Data Scientist extracting intelligence from this network, my models improve with every transaction processed. I'm requesting $70,000-$90,000 in RSU/4yr because the value of the network intelligence I create compounds directly with AvidXchange's growth."

**Lever 3 — Purposeful AI Model Development:** "AvidXchange's Purposeful AI strategy requires data scientists who can build models that are not just accurate but purposeful — tuned to the specific needs of mid-market finance teams in real estate, HOA, and construction. This vertical specialization means my models must balance statistical rigor with domain relevance. I'd like a $12,000-$15,000 sign-on bonus reflecting the scarcity of data scientists with both financial services domain expertise and ML model development skills in the Charlotte market."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise Tier Feature Attribution:** "Every Knowledge Discovery feature I build — from cash flow prediction to supplier risk scoring — can be directly attributed to Enterprise Tier upsell revenue. I'd like a performance bonus of 18-20% tied to Enterprise Tier adoption metrics and Knowledge Discovery feature utilization rates, recognizing the measurable revenue impact of my analytical work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $160,000 base for Charlotte, $165,000 for Atlanta, or $155,000 remote. Data Scientists should emphasize that they are building the Knowledge Discovery engine — the core IP that powers the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier premium. Push for $70,000-$90,000 RSU/4yr, framing equity as aligned with the compounding value of AvidPay Network intelligence. Your accept-at floor should be $145,000 base with $55,000 RSU/4yr. If base is firm, negotiate a $12,000-$15,000 sign-on bonus and push for a performance bonus tied to Enterprise Tier adoption. Position yourself as the intelligence architect, not just a data analyst — your models are the product.
