**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX) are the technical face of the platform for the company's most complex customer engagements. With 8,800+ customers spanning real estate management companies, HOA administrators, and construction firms, the Solutions Architect must translate AvidXchange's AP automation and AvidPay Network capabilities into architectures tailored to each customer's ERP landscape, compliance requirements, and payment workflows. As AvidXchange launches its Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier, the Solutions Architect role becomes even more critical — you are the person who demonstrates how Knowledge Discovery features integrate with a customer's existing financial stack and deliver measurable ROI.

The Charlotte NC hub is where Solutions Architects work most closely with product engineering, customer success, and sales leadership. This role carries significant revenue influence: your ability to architect compelling solutions for Enterprise Tier prospects directly impacts deal size and close rates. With $420M+ in revenue and vertical-specific integration challenges across real estate, HOA, and construction, Solutions Architects must be fluent in ERP systems (Yardi, MRI, Sage), payment processing workflows, and increasingly, the AI-powered intelligence capabilities that differentiate AvidXchange from competitors like Bill.com and Tipalti.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — Enterprise Tier Technical Sales Multiplier:** "As a Solutions Architect, I'm the technical closer for AvidXchange's highest-value deals. The Enterprise Tier's Knowledge Discovery capabilities need to be demonstrated and architected for each customer's unique environment — that's my job. I'm directly influencing deal sizes in the $200K-$500K+ ARR range. I'm requesting $165,000-$175,000 base in Charlotte to reflect the revenue impact of this pre-sales technical leadership."

**Lever 2 — Purposeful AI Integration Complexity:** "Selling Purposeful AI to mid-market finance teams means I need to architect solutions that integrate Knowledge Discovery with legacy ERP systems across real estate, HOA, and construction verticals. This is not standard SaaS integration — it's custom AI architecture layered on top of complex financial workflows for 8,800+ diverse customer environments. I'm requesting $80,000-$100,000 in RSU/4yr to align my equity with the Enterprise Tier revenue I help close."

**Lever 3 — AvidPay Network Expansion Architect:** "Every Enterprise Tier customer I onboard expands the AvidPay Network — adding suppliers, increasing payment volume, and strengthening the network effects that are AvidXchange's competitive moat. My architectural decisions during implementation directly determine how deeply customers adopt the platform. I'd like a variable compensation component of $25,000-$40,000 tied to Enterprise Tier deal closure and AvidPay Network expansion metrics."

**Lever 4 — Charlotte Hub Customer Proximity:** "Being based in the Charlotte hub gives me the closest possible collaboration with engineering and product teams, enabling faster custom architecture development for Enterprise Tier customers. I'm seeing Solutions Architect offers from competing Southeast fintechs at $170,000-$185,000 base. I'd like a $12,000-$15,000 sign-on bonus to commit to the Charlotte hub and AvidXchange's Knowledge Discovery customer architecture mission."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $170,000 base for Charlotte, $175,000 for Atlanta, or $165,000 remote. Solutions Architects have unique leverage because of their direct revenue impact — frame every ask around Enterprise Tier deal closure and AvidPay Network expansion. Push for $80,000-$100,000 RSU/4yr and a variable compensation component of $25,000-$40,000 tied to deal metrics. Your accept-at floor should be $155,000 base with $60,000 RSU/4yr. If base is capped, push for a higher variable component (uncapped if possible) and a $12,000-$15,000 sign-on. Frame yourself as the person who makes the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier's Knowledge Discovery vision tangible for customers — without your architectural expertise, deals stall.
