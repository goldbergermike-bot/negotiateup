**Negotiation DNA**

The Staff Software Engineer at AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX) is the highest-impact individual contributor role in the engineering organization, responsible for cross-team technical strategy and the architectural blueprint of the company's AI-powered financial operations platform. AvidXchange's transformation from a mid-market AP automation leader to a Purposeful AI platform requires staff-level engineers who can see across the entire technology surface — from the AvidPay Network's payment infrastructure to the Knowledge Discovery layer that will define the Enterprise Tier value proposition. With 8,800+ customers generating massive volumes of invoice, payment, and supplier data, the staff engineer shapes how that data becomes intelligence.

At this level, you are not just a Charlotte hub contributor — you are a company-wide technical leader whose design decisions set the trajectory for dozens of engineers. AvidXchange's $420M+ revenue base and publicly traded status (NASDAQ: AVDX) mean that your architectural choices have direct P&L implications. The company's vertical focus on real estate, HOA, and construction creates domain-specific technical challenges — multi-entity payment routing, compliance-grade audit trails, and industry-specific workflow automation — that demand staff-level expertise. The Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier strategy creates a clear line between your technical output and AvidXchange's ability to command premium pricing from its largest customers.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — Platform Architecture Authority:** "As a Staff Engineer, I'll be the technical authority behind AvidXchange's Purposeful AI platform architecture. The Knowledge Discovery capabilities that define the Enterprise Tier require someone who can design cross-system intelligence layers spanning the AvidPay Network, invoice processing, and supplier management. This is platform-defining work, not feature work. I'm targeting $200,000-$215,000 base in Charlotte to reflect the strategic scope of this role."

**Lever 2 — Cross-Vertical Technical Strategy:** "AvidXchange serves 8,800+ customers across real estate, HOA, and construction — each with distinct payment workflows and compliance requirements. As a Staff Engineer, I'll be designing the abstraction layers that allow Purposeful AI to operate across all three verticals simultaneously. This cross-domain architectural complexity is why I'm requesting $150,000-$180,000 in RSU/4yr — my work will directly determine how scalable the Enterprise Tier offering becomes."

**Lever 3 — Knowledge Discovery Revenue Linkage:** "The Enterprise Tier's Knowledge Discovery premium is AvidXchange's path to higher net revenue retention. As the staff-level engineer responsible for the technical foundations of that premium, my compensation should reflect the direct revenue linkage. I'd like to negotiate a performance bonus target of 20-25% tied to Enterprise Tier adoption and Knowledge Discovery feature launches, rather than the standard 15% target."

**Lever 4 — Charlotte Hub Technical Gravity:** "Staff engineers set the technical culture for the entire Charlotte hub and beyond. AvidXchange needs someone at this level to attract and retain senior talent in an increasingly competitive Southeast fintech market. I have competing opportunities at $220,000+ base from growth-stage fintechs and bank platform teams. I'd like AvidXchange to match the top of my range and add a $25,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus to reflect the organizational impact of this hire."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Staff-level compensation at AvidXchange is where you have the most room to negotiate — the company competes with Google L6, Meta E6, and Stripe L4 for this caliber of talent. Anchor at $210,000 base for Charlotte, $215,000 for Atlanta, or $205,000 remote. Push hard on RSU/4yr: target $150,000-$180,000 as this is a public company equity play. Your accept-at floor should be $185,000 base with $120,000 RSU/4yr. Frame every ask around the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier: you are not a maintenance engineer, you are the architect of AvidXchange's Knowledge Discovery platform, and your work directly determines Enterprise Tier pricing power. If base is capped, negotiate a $30,000 sign-on bonus and accelerated RSU vesting (e.g., 30% vest in year one instead of 25%).
