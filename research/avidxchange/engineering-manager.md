**Negotiation DNA**

The Engineering Manager at AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX) owns the intersection of people, process, and product delivery. You are accountable for the velocity and quality of engineering teams building the AP automation platform that 8,800+ mid-market customers depend on daily. As AvidXchange transforms from a workflow automation company into a Purposeful AI-powered financial operations platform, Engineering Managers are the force multipliers — responsible for recruiting and retaining the talent needed to deliver the Knowledge Discovery Enterprise Tier vision, while simultaneously maintaining the reliability of the AvidPay Network's payment infrastructure.

The Charlotte NC hub is where AvidXchange's engineering leadership is concentrated, and an EM based there has outsized influence on hiring strategy, team culture, and delivery cadence. With $420M+ in revenue and a public market valuation (NASDAQ: AVDX) tied to growth and AI execution, Engineering Managers carry direct accountability for shipping the features that drive Enterprise Tier adoption. Your teams will span AP automation, supplier payments, and the emerging AI capabilities that differentiate AvidXchange from competitors like Bill.com and Tipalti. The Knowledge Discovery premium means your delivery roadmap is directly linked to revenue expansion — making this an unusually high-leverage management role for a mid-market fintech.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Transformation Delivery Leader:** "AvidXchange's shift to Purposeful AI is fundamentally a delivery challenge — the technology vision is clear, but execution depends on well-led engineering teams. As an Engineering Manager, I'll be directly responsible for shipping the Knowledge Discovery features that define the Enterprise Tier. I'm requesting a base salary of $190,000-$200,000 in Charlotte because this isn't a maintenance management role — it's a transformation leadership role."

**Lever 2 — AvidPay Network Reliability Ownership:** "My teams will own the reliability of the AvidPay Network, which processes payment flows for 8,800+ customers. Network downtime means real financial impact for suppliers and buyers across real estate, HOA, and construction verticals. I'd like an RSU package of $120,000-$150,000 over four years to align my equity incentives with the network uptime and performance I'll be accountable for."

**Lever 3 — Charlotte Hub Talent Magnet Premium:** "Engineering Managers in the Charlotte hub are AvidXchange's primary recruiting asset — my ability to attract and retain senior engineers directly determines the company's capacity to execute on the Knowledge Discovery roadmap. I'm seeing Engineering Manager offers from Charlotte-area fintechs and bank innovation teams at $195,000-$210,000 base. I'd like AvidXchange to compete at the top of that range, plus a $15,000-$20,000 sign-on bonus."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise Tier Delivery Bonus Structure:** "The Enterprise Tier's success is measurable: customer adoption rates, Knowledge Discovery feature utilization, and upsell revenue. As the Engineering Manager responsible for delivery, I'd like a performance bonus target of 20% tied to Enterprise Tier launch milestones and Purposeful AI feature delivery, rather than the standard 15% organizational bonus target."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Engineering Managers at AvidXchange should anchor at $195,000 base in Charlotte, $200,000 in Atlanta, or $190,000 remote. The strongest lever is RSU negotiation — push for $120,000-$150,000 over four years, framing it as alignment between your delivery accountability and AVDX stock performance. Your accept-at floor should be $175,000 base with $90,000 RSU/4yr. Frame yourself as the delivery leader for the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier transformation — not just a people manager, but the person who converts Knowledge Discovery vision into shipped product. If base is capped, push for a $20,000 sign-on bonus and an elevated 20% bonus target. Always reference the competitive Charlotte engineering management market and AvidXchange's need for leaders who can recruit AI-capable talent.
