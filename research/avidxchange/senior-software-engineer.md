**Negotiation DNA**

As a Senior Software Engineer at AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX), you occupy the critical leverage point between execution and architecture. AvidXchange's 8,800+ customers — spanning real estate management companies, HOA administrators, and construction firms — depend on systems that you will own end-to-end. The AvidPay Network, which connects thousands of suppliers to automated payment flows, requires senior engineers who can balance system reliability at scale with the velocity needed to deliver the company's Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier vision. Your seniority means you are not just writing code — you are making technical decisions that will determine whether AvidXchange successfully transitions from AP automation leader to AI-powered financial operations platform.

The Charlotte NC hub is AvidXchange's engineering heartbeat, and senior engineers based there carry outsized influence on architectural direction and team culture. With $420M+ in annual revenue and a strategic bet on Knowledge Discovery capabilities, AvidXchange is investing in senior ICs who can bridge the gap between the company's proven AP automation infrastructure and the emerging AI-native financial intelligence layer. This is a pivotal moment: the Enterprise Tier pricing structure means every Knowledge Discovery feature you ship directly impacts revenue per customer, making your work measurable in ARR terms.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — Purposeful AI Architecture Ownership:** "At the senior level, I won't just be implementing features — I'll be making architectural decisions that determine how effectively AvidXchange's Purposeful AI capabilities integrate with the existing AP automation stack. The Knowledge Discovery layer requires someone who can design systems that extract intelligence from payment data at scale. I'd like to see a base salary of $165,000-$175,000 in Charlotte to reflect the architectural ownership this role demands."

**Lever 2 — AvidPay Network Revenue Multiplier:** "The AvidPay Network is AvidXchange's competitive moat, and as a Senior Software Engineer I'll be directly responsible for its evolution. Every improvement I make to payment processing reliability and speed compounds across 8,800+ customers. I'm requesting an RSU package of $80,000-$100,000 over four years, because my impact on network transaction volume directly correlates to AVDX stock performance."

**Lever 3 — Charlotte Hub Technical Leadership Premium:** "AvidXchange's Charlotte hub is where the most critical engineering decisions are made, and as a senior engineer I'll be setting technical standards for the entire organization. Charlotte's fintech talent market has tightened significantly — I'm seeing competing offers from bank innovation teams and growth-stage fintechs in the $170,000-$185,000 base range. I'd like AvidXchange to compete at the top of that band to secure my commitment to the Knowledge Discovery roadmap."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise Tier Feature Monetization:** "The Enterprise Tier pricing model means that Knowledge Discovery features I build will directly translate to higher per-customer revenue. I want my compensation to reflect this monetization linkage. I'm proposing a performance bonus structure tied to Enterprise Tier adoption metrics — specifically a 15-20% target bonus rather than the standard 10-15%, given that my work will be directly attributable to upsell revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your negotiation at $170,000 base for Charlotte, $175,000 for Atlanta, or $165,000 remote. Push for $80,000-$100,000 in RSU/4yr — this is where AvidXchange has the most flexibility as a public company (NASDAQ: AVDX). Your accept-at floor should be $155,000 base with $60,000 RSU/4yr minimum. Use the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier transformation as your central narrative: you are not joining an AP automation company, you are joining an AI-powered financial operations platform at its inflection point. If base salary is capped, negotiate for a $15,000-$20,000 sign-on bonus framed around the Knowledge Discovery premium. Always reference the competitive Charlotte fintech market and the architectural ownership this senior role requires.
