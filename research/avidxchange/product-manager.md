**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX) own the strategic translation between customer needs and engineering execution. With 8,800+ customers across real estate, HOA, and construction verticals, the PM role at AvidXchange is uniquely domain-intensive — you must understand multi-entity payment workflows, compliance requirements, and the operational pain points of mid-market finance teams. The company's Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier strategy elevates the PM role further: you are not just defining features, you are defining how Knowledge Discovery capabilities monetize across the customer base.

AvidXchange's Charlotte NC hub is the center of product strategy, and PMs based there have the closest collaboration with engineering leadership, design, and customer success teams. The AvidPay Network — connecting suppliers to automated payments — is a two-sided marketplace that requires product thinking beyond traditional B2B SaaS. With $420M+ in revenue and a strategic push toward AI-powered financial operations, Product Managers are responsible for identifying which Knowledge Discovery use cases unlock the highest willingness-to-pay among Enterprise Tier customers. This is a product role where your roadmap decisions directly impact ARR expansion, making it one of the most commercially accountable PM positions in mid-market fintech.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — Enterprise Tier Monetization Architect:** "As a Product Manager, I'll be defining the feature set that justifies the Enterprise Tier's Knowledge Discovery premium. My product decisions will directly determine whether AvidXchange's 8,800+ customers upgrade to higher-value tiers. This revenue accountability means my compensation should reflect a strategic PM role, not just a feature-definition role. I'm targeting $160,000-$170,000 base in Charlotte."

**Lever 2 — Purposeful AI Product-Market Fit Owner:** "AvidXchange's Purposeful AI vision is ambitious, but it only succeeds if the product finds real adoption among mid-market AP teams. As the PM responsible for translating Purposeful AI capabilities into customer value across real estate, HOA, and construction verticals, I'm the bridge between technology and market. I'm requesting $80,000-$100,000 in RSU/4yr because my product-market fit decisions directly drive AVDX's growth trajectory."

**Lever 3 — AvidPay Network Two-Sided Product Strategy:** "The AvidPay Network requires product thinking that spans both the buyer and supplier experience. This two-sided marketplace complexity is rare in B2B fintech and demands a PM with network effects intuition. I'd like a 20% performance bonus target tied to AvidPay Network growth metrics and Knowledge Discovery adoption, reflecting the dual-sided product accountability."

**Lever 4 — Charlotte Hub Product Leadership Premium:** "PMs in the Charlotte hub set the product direction for the entire company. AvidXchange needs product leaders who can navigate the shift from AP automation to AI-powered financial operations while maintaining the customer intimacy that 8,800+ accounts expect. I'm seeing competing PM offers in the $165,000-$180,000 range from Southeast fintechs. I'd like a $12,000-$15,000 sign-on bonus to close the gap and commit to the Knowledge Discovery roadmap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $165,000 base for Charlotte, $170,000 for Atlanta, or $160,000 remote. Product Managers should lean heavily into the Enterprise Tier monetization narrative — your roadmap decisions directly determine how much revenue AvidXchange extracts from Knowledge Discovery. Push for $80,000-$100,000 RSU/4yr as the primary equity ask. Your accept-at floor should be $150,000 base with $60,000 RSU/4yr. If the base is firm, negotiate a $12,000-$15,000 sign-on and push for a 20% bonus target tied to Purposeful AI feature adoption metrics. Always frame yourself as the PM who converts the Knowledge Discovery vision into monetizable product — not just a backlog manager.
