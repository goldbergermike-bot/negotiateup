**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX) protect a financial platform that processes payment transactions for 8,800+ customers across real estate, HOA, and construction verticals. This is not abstract security work — a breach of the AvidPay Network could expose payment data for thousands of suppliers and buyers, creating catastrophic regulatory, financial, and reputational damage. As AvidXchange expands into Purposeful AI and the Knowledge Discovery Enterprise Tier, the security surface grows dramatically: AI model integrity, data privacy in ML training pipelines, prompt injection risks in financial intelligence surfaces, and the compliance implications of AI-generated financial recommendations all fall under the Security Engineer's mandate.

The Charlotte NC hub is where AvidXchange's security team maintains the closest collaboration with engineering, compliance, and risk management. With $420M+ in revenue and publicly traded status (NASDAQ: AVDX), the company faces elevated regulatory scrutiny — SOC 2, PCI-DSS, and industry-specific compliance requirements across its three core verticals. Security Engineers are scarce in the Charlotte market, and AvidXchange competes for this talent against major banks, insurance companies, and financial services firms headquartered in the region. The Knowledge Discovery Enterprise Tier adds an entirely new security domain: AI safety for financial applications.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Security Pioneer:** "The Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier introduces security challenges that AvidXchange has never faced before — model integrity, adversarial attack surfaces on Knowledge Discovery features, data poisoning risks in ML training pipelines, and prompt injection vulnerabilities in AI-powered financial interfaces. I bring specialized AI security expertise to the Charlotte hub. I'm requesting $170,000-$180,000 base to reflect the scarcity of engineers who can secure both traditional fintech infrastructure and AI-native financial operations."

**Lever 2 — AvidPay Network Threat Surface Guardian:** "The AvidPay Network connects thousands of suppliers to payment flows, and every connection point is a potential attack surface. As a Security Engineer responsible for network-level threat modeling and runtime security, I'm protecting the infrastructure that 8,800+ customers trust with their financial operations. I'm requesting $80,000-$100,000 in RSU/4yr because a single major security incident could materially impact AVDX's stock price — my work is literal risk mitigation."

**Lever 3 — Knowledge Discovery Compliance Architect:** "The Knowledge Discovery Enterprise Tier will process financial data through AI models, creating new regulatory and compliance obligations. I'll be designing the security architecture that ensures these AI features meet SOC 2, PCI-DSS, and emerging AI governance standards across real estate, HOA, and construction verticals. I'd like a $15,000-$18,000 sign-on bonus reflecting the specialized compliance-plus-AI security expertise this role demands."

**Lever 4 — Charlotte Fintech Security Talent Premium:** "Security engineers with financial services experience are among the hardest roles to fill in the Charlotte market — I'm competing with offers from major banks and insurance companies at $175,000-$195,000 base. AvidXchange's Purposeful AI ambitions require security talent that understands both fintech compliance and AI security. I'd like a performance bonus of 15-18% tied to security posture metrics and Enterprise Tier compliance certification milestones."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $175,000 base for Charlotte, $180,000 for Atlanta, or $170,000 remote. Security Engineers have exceptional leverage because of talent scarcity and the catastrophic downside risk they mitigate. Frame yourself as the person who makes the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier safe enough to sell — Knowledge Discovery features cannot launch without security certification. Push for $80,000-$100,000 RSU/4yr and a $15,000-$18,000 sign-on. Your accept-at floor should be $155,000 base with $60,000 RSU/4yr. If base is capped, push for an elevated bonus (15-18%), a $15,000 sign-on, and guaranteed annual equity refreshers. Always reference the dual security mandate: traditional AvidPay Network protection plus AI-era Knowledge Discovery security.
