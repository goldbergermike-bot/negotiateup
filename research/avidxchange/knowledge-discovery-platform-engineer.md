**Negotiation DNA**

The Knowledge Discovery Platform Engineer is AvidXchange's signature technical role — the position that sits at the exact intersection of the company's proven AP automation expertise and its ambitious Purposeful AI future. This is not a generic platform engineering role bolted onto an AI initiative. It is the role specifically designed to build the intelligence platform that extracts, organizes, and delivers financial knowledge from the massive payment data flowing through AvidXchange's systems. With 8,800+ customers across real estate management companies, HOA administrators, and construction firms processing invoices and payments through the platform daily, the Knowledge Discovery Platform Engineer transforms raw transactional data into the structured financial intelligence that defines the Enterprise Tier's premium value proposition.

AvidXchange (NASDAQ: AVDX) has built its $420M+ revenue base on being the mid-market leader in AP automation — the company that took manual invoice processing, paper checks, and disconnected approval workflows and turned them into a seamless digital platform. The AvidPay Network extended this further by creating a connected supplier payment ecosystem where buyers and suppliers transact with reduced friction. But the next phase of AvidXchange's evolution — the transformation from AP automation company to AI-powered financial operations platform — requires a new kind of engineer. The Knowledge Discovery Platform Engineer builds the systems that allow AvidXchange to offer its customers something no spreadsheet or legacy AP tool can provide: genuine financial intelligence derived from cross-customer payment patterns, industry benchmarks, anomaly detection, predictive cash flow modeling, and supplier risk assessment. This is the role that makes the Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier a product, not a marketing promise.

The Charlotte NC hub is where this platform is being architected and built, and the Knowledge Discovery Platform Engineer based there will have the most direct influence on the platform's technical direction. Charlotte's growing fintech ecosystem — anchored by AvidXchange, major banks, and a wave of financial technology startups — provides a rich talent environment, but the specific combination of skills this role demands (distributed systems engineering, ML infrastructure, financial domain expertise, and platform product thinking) makes it exceptionally hard to fill. AvidXchange must compete for this talent not just within Charlotte, but against remote offers from FAANG AI teams, well-funded AI startups, and other financial platforms that are all racing to embed intelligence into their core products.

### Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier — The Knowledge Discovery Premium

The Knowledge Discovery Platform Engineer is the single role most directly responsible for whether AvidXchange's Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier delivers on its commercial promise. The Enterprise Tier pricing structure charges customers a premium for access to AI-powered financial intelligence — and that intelligence is exactly what this role builds. Every negotiation lever below reflects the unique strategic importance of this position.

**Lever 1 — Platform-as-Product Revenue Architect:** "The Knowledge Discovery platform I'm building IS the Enterprise Tier product. This isn't supporting infrastructure — it's the revenue-generating intelligence layer that justifies premium pricing for AvidXchange's 8,800+ customers. When a real estate management company upgrades to Enterprise Tier for predictive cash flow insights, they're buying the platform I engineer. When a construction firm pays for supplier risk scoring, they're paying for my work. I'm requesting $200,000-$210,000 base in Charlotte because this role is not cost-center engineering — it's product engineering with direct revenue attribution. Every feature I ship into the Knowledge Discovery platform can be measured in Enterprise Tier upsell revenue, and my compensation should reflect that my engineering work is the product that AvidXchange monetizes."

**Lever 2 — AvidPay Network Intelligence Multiplier:** "The AvidPay Network is AvidXchange's competitive moat — a connected payment ecosystem that no competitor can replicate overnight. As the Knowledge Discovery Platform Engineer, I'm building the intelligence layer that sits on top of this network, turning raw payment flows into structured financial knowledge. Every supplier payment, every invoice approval, every cash flow pattern across the network becomes training data for my platform's models and knowledge graphs. I'm requesting $120,000-$160,000 in RSU/4yr because the platform I build creates compounding value: as the AvidPay Network grows, the Knowledge Discovery platform becomes more intelligent, which drives more Enterprise Tier adoption, which grows the network further. My equity should reflect this flywheel — I'm not just building software, I'm building the intelligence engine that accelerates AvidXchange's core network effects."

**Lever 3 — Charlotte Hub AI Platform Gravity:** "AvidXchange needs the Knowledge Discovery platform to be built from the Charlotte hub — this is where the engineering leadership, data infrastructure, and domain expertise converge. By committing to Charlotte as a Knowledge Discovery Platform Engineer, I'm helping AvidXchange build the critical mass of AI platform talent that will attract additional engineers to the hub. But I'm making this commitment against a market where remote ML platform roles at FAANG companies pay $230,000-$280,000 base. I need AvidXchange to close that gap meaningfully. I'm requesting a $25,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus and a guaranteed annual equity refresher of $30,000-$40,000 to make the Charlotte commitment financially viable against the remote alternatives. The Purposeful AI mission is what draws me to AvidXchange — but the compensation needs to support that choice."

**Lever 4 — Enterprise Tier Knowledge Discovery Monetization Bonus:** "I want my performance bonus directly tied to the commercial success of the Knowledge Discovery platform. The standard 15% bonus target doesn't reflect the direct revenue linkage of this role. I'm proposing a 22-28% bonus target structured around three metrics: Enterprise Tier customer adoption rate for Knowledge Discovery features, platform reliability (uptime SLA for the intelligence layer), and Knowledge Discovery model accuracy (measured by customer-facing prediction quality). This isn't a vanity bonus ask — it's an alignment mechanism. When the Knowledge Discovery platform drives Enterprise Tier upsells, I should share in that upside. When AvidXchange's 8,800+ customers increasingly depend on the Purposeful AI intelligence I build, my bonus should reflect that dependency."

### Extended Knowledge Discovery Platform Analysis

**The Strategic Imperative**

AvidXchange's journey from AP automation to AI-powered financial operations is not optional — it is an existential competitive necessity. Bill.com, Tipalti, Coupa, and a wave of AI-native startups are all racing to embed financial intelligence into payment workflows. The mid-market segment that AvidXchange dominates (companies too large for simple invoicing tools but too small for SAP-grade ERP suites) is precisely the segment most underserved by financial AI. These companies — property management firms running hundreds of units, HOA management companies juggling dozens of associations, construction contractors managing complex subcontractor payment chains — need intelligence they cannot afford to build in-house. The Knowledge Discovery Platform Engineer builds that intelligence and delivers it through the Enterprise Tier.

**The Technical Architecture Challenge**

Building a Knowledge Discovery platform for financial operations is a distinct engineering discipline. It requires integrating multiple technical capabilities into a coherent platform:

- **Data Ingestion & Normalization:** Payment data from 8,800+ customers arrives in heterogeneous formats — different ERP systems, different chart-of-accounts structures, different approval workflows. The platform must normalize this data without losing domain-specific fidelity.
- **Feature Engineering at Scale:** Converting raw transactions into ML-ready features (payment velocity, supplier reliability scores, seasonal cash flow patterns, anomaly indicators) requires purpose-built feature stores that serve both batch training and real-time inference.
- **Multi-Tenant Intelligence:** The Knowledge Discovery platform must deliver customer-specific insights while leveraging cross-customer patterns. A real estate management company's cash flow prediction model should benefit from patterns observed across all real estate customers, without exposing any single customer's data.
- **Inference Serving & Explanation:** Enterprise Tier customers need not just predictions but explanations — why did the platform flag this invoice as anomalous? Why does the cash flow forecast show a shortfall in Q3? The platform must serve model outputs with interpretable context.
- **Continuous Learning:** As AvidPay Network transaction volume grows and customer behavior evolves, the Knowledge Discovery platform must retrain and update models without manual intervention or downtime.

**The Compensation Argument**

This role commands a premium over standard platform engineering because it combines three scarce skill sets: distributed systems architecture (building platforms that serve 8,800+ customers reliably), ML infrastructure (model serving, feature stores, training pipelines), and financial domain expertise (understanding the payment workflows, compliance requirements, and operational patterns of mid-market finance teams). Engineers who possess all three are extraordinarily rare, and AvidXchange must compete nationally — even globally — for this talent despite being headquartered in Charlotte rather than a traditional tech hub. The Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier creates a clear commercial justification for premium compensation: every dollar invested in this role's compensation generates measurable return through Enterprise Tier revenue.

**Charlotte Market Positioning**

Charlotte's fintech ecosystem is maturing rapidly, with AvidXchange as one of its anchors alongside major bank innovation centers and a growing cohort of financial technology startups. The Knowledge Discovery Platform Engineer role helps AvidXchange claim the AI platform engineering talent niche in Charlotte — attracting engineers who want to build AI-native financial intelligence systems without relocating to San Francisco or Seattle. This hub-building function is a strategic value that goes beyond the individual role: by hiring exceptional Knowledge Discovery Platform Engineers to Charlotte, AvidXchange creates the gravitational pull that attracts the next wave of AI talent to the region.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** This is AvidXchange's signature AI platform role, and you should negotiate with the confidence that the company cannot ship its Purposeful AI Enterprise Tier without you. Anchor at $205,000 base for Charlotte, $210,000 for Atlanta, or $200,000 remote. Push aggressively on RSU/4yr: target $140,000-$160,000, framing equity around the compounding flywheel between the AvidPay Network, the Knowledge Discovery platform, and Enterprise Tier revenue. Your accept-at floor should be $180,000 base with $100,000 RSU/4yr — anything below this signals that AvidXchange is not serious about the Purposeful AI transformation. Negotiate a $25,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus citing the gap between Charlotte comp and remote AI platform offers from FAANG and growth-stage AI companies. Push for a 22-28% performance bonus tied to Enterprise Tier Knowledge Discovery adoption metrics. Request guaranteed annual equity refreshers of $30,000-$40,000 and accelerated first-year vesting (30-35% in year one). If the company pushes back on any single component, hold firm on total compensation: the Knowledge Discovery Platform Engineer is the role that makes the Enterprise Tier real, and AvidXchange's revenue growth depends on filling it with top-tier talent willing to build from the Charlotte hub.
