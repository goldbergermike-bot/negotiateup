### Engineering Manager | Deloitte Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (15-25%) + Equity Grants | Manager/Senior Manager Level

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $150K-$200K | $20K-$60K | $23K-$50K (15-25%) | $198K-$310K |
| Chicago | $140K-$185K | $15K-$50K | $21K-$46K (15-25%) | $180K-$281K |
| London | £100K-£145K | £10K-£35K | £15K-£36K (15-25%) | £125K-£216K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Deloitte lead technology delivery teams for client engagements and internal platforms. At the Manager/Senior Manager level, Deloitte's comp becomes more competitive — bonus increases to 15-25%, and equity grants become meaningful. EMs at Deloitte manage teams of 6-15 engineers and are directly accountable for engagement delivery, team utilization, and client satisfaction. The dual nature of Deloitte's EM role — managing both people and client delivery — makes it more demanding than typical tech company EM roles. This level is 2-5 years from Partner, making it a critical retention point where the firm should invest in comp. [Source: Deloitte Technology Management Track 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Deloitte Manager/Senior Manager (Tech) = Google L5-L6 EM = Accenture Manager = PwC Director

**Global Levers**

1. **Client Delivery P&L:** "I own the delivery P&L for engagements worth $3M-$15M annually. My management directly determines engagement profitability and client retention."
2. **Partner Track Proximity:** "I'm 2-5 years from Partner. My current comp should reflect this investment trajectory — not just my current level, but the value of my progression."
3. **Team Retention Responsibility:** "I'm responsible for retaining 6-15 engineers in a competitive market. My effectiveness directly reduces $200K+ per-engineer replacement costs."
4. **Equity Escalation:** "At this level, equity should be meaningful, not token. I need $60K+ in equity over 4 years to demonstrate the firm's commitment to my partner track progression."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm leading technology delivery teams and progressing toward Partner. I need $195K base, a 20% guaranteed bonus, equity of $55K over 4 years, and a $25K signing bonus. My tech EM alternatives offer $380K-$470K TC." Deloitte will counter at $170K-$185K base with $30K-$40K equity. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $255K.
