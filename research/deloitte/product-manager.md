| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Deloitte drive product strategy for the firm's internal technology platforms (including Converge AI), client-facing digital products, and the tools Deloitte's consultants use daily. PMs at Deloitte operate at massive scale — the firm has 450,000+ employees and serves thousands of clients. Your product decisions affect not just engineers but hundreds of thousands of consultants and clients. Deloitte's comp structure is lower than tech companies, with 10-20% bonus and limited equity at senior levels. The career value is in the breadth of product experience and the partner track progression. [Source: Deloitte Technology Product Management 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Deloitte Senior Consultant / Manager (PM) = Google L4-L5 PM = Accenture Consultant PM = PwC Manager PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Scale:** "I own product strategy for platforms used by 450,000+ Deloitte employees and thousands of clients. This scale of product impact is rare."
2. **Converge AI Product Ownership:** If your role touches Converge: "I'm shaping the product strategy for Deloitte's flagship AI platform — the product the firm sells to every AI engagement."
3. **Tech Company PM Comp Gap:** "PMs at Google, Meta, and Stripe earn $300K-$450K TC with equity. Deloitte's $149K-$257K leaves a significant gap that should be narrowed."
4. **Partner Track Value:** "The partner track offers long-term comp of $500K-$1M+. In exchange for this trajectory, I need competitive short-term comp to make the investment worthwhile."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm driving product strategy for platforms at massive scale. I need $180K base with an 18% guaranteed bonus and a $20K signing bonus. Tech PM offers are at $320K-$420K TC — Deloitte needs to be competitive for experienced PMs." Deloitte will counter at $160K-$170K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $215K.
