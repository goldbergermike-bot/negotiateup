### Solutions Architect | Deloitte Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (15-25%) + Equity at Senior Levels | Technology Consulting Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $145K-$200K | $0-$50K (senior only) | $22K-$50K (15-25%) | $167K-$300K |
| Chicago | $135K-$185K | $0-$40K (senior only) | $20K-$46K (15-25%) | $155K-$271K |
| London | £100K-£145K | £0-£30K (senior only) | £15K-£36K (15-25%) | £115K-£211K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Deloitte are client-facing technical leaders who design technology architectures for the firm's largest and most complex consulting engagements. SAs at Deloitte work on enterprise transformation projects — designing target architectures for cloud migrations, ERP modernizations, AI platform deployments, and digital transformations worth $10M-$100M+. This is a senior role that maps to the Manager/Senior Manager level, where comp includes meaningful bonus (15-25%) and emerging equity grants. Solutions Architects also contribute to pre-sales, helping Deloitte win competitive pitches against Accenture, IBM, and other technology consultancies.

**Level Mapping:** Deloitte Manager/Senior Manager (SA) = AWS Senior SA = Google Cloud Customer Engineer (L5) = Accenture Senior Manager (Tech)

**Global Levers**

1. **Engagement Revenue Enablement:** "I design architectures for engagements worth $10M-$100M. My technical credibility is what makes these deals viable — clients trust Deloitte to deliver because of the architecture I design."
2. **Pre-Sales Win Rate:** "My architecture presentations directly influence whether Deloitte wins competitive pitches. I'm not just delivering — I'm helping sell multi-million dollar engagements."
3. **Cloud Provider SA Benchmark:** "Solutions Architects at AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure earn $250K-$400K TC with equity. Deloitte needs to be competitive for SA talent."
4. **Partner Track Architecture:** "SA is a natural path to Technology Partner at Deloitte. My current comp should reflect this trajectory and the investment the firm is making in my development."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm designing architectures for Deloitte's largest technology engagements and contributing to pre-sales. I need $195K base, a 20% guaranteed bonus, equity of $45K over 4 years, and a $25K signing bonus. Cloud provider SA roles offer $300K-$380K TC." Deloitte will counter at $175K-$185K base with $25K-$35K equity. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $260K.
