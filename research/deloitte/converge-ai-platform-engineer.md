### Converge AI Platform Engineer | Deloitte Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+10-20% AI PLATFORM PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $140K-$195K | $0-$40K (senior only) | $14K-$39K (10-20%) | $154K-$274K |
| Chicago | $130K-$180K | $0-$35K (senior only) | $13K-$36K (10-20%) | $143K-$251K |
| Hyderabad | ₹20L-₹38L | None | ₹2L-₹8L (10-20%) | ₹22L-₹46L |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Deloitte's signature AI engineering role. Converge is Deloitte's proprietary AI platform — an enterprise-grade GenAI orchestration system that Deloitte deploys for Fortune 500 clients across industries. Converge AI Platform Engineers build the core infrastructure: LLM orchestration, RAG pipelines, enterprise security controls, and multi-tenant AI deployment. Deloitte's $65B revenue makes it the largest professional services firm in the world, and Converge is the technology platform the firm is betting its AI future on. Deloitte's comp structure differs from MBB: lower base salaries, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity only at senior levels (Senior Manager and above). The partner track at Deloitte offers equity participation — use this long-term incentive in negotiations. [Source: Deloitte Converge AI Platform 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Deloitte Senior Consultant (Tech) = Google L3-L4 = Accenture Analyst-Consultant = PwC Senior Associate

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Converge AI Platform Engineer builds Deloitte's central AI capability:
- **Enterprise GenAI Orchestration:** Building the platform that coordinates LLMs, knowledge bases, and business logic for enterprise AI deployments
- **Multi-Client Scale:** Converge serves hundreds of Deloitte's largest clients simultaneously
- **Compliance & Trust:** Enterprise AI requires SOC 2, HIPAA, and industry-specific compliance — you build these controls into the platform
- **Revenue Engine:** Every Converge deployment generates consulting revenue — you're building the product the firm sells

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue Platform Frame:** "Converge is the platform Deloitte sells to every AI engagement. Each deployment generates $1M-$10M in consulting fees. I'm building the product that the firm's AI revenue depends on."
2. **AI Platform Scarcity:** "Engineers who can build enterprise-grade GenAI orchestration platforms are extremely rare. Most GenAI talent is focused on model development, not enterprise platform engineering."
3. **Partner Track Investment:** "I'm investing in Deloitte's partner track, which has significant long-term equity value. In exchange for this long-term commitment, I expect competitive short-term comp — $190K+ base with 15% guaranteed bonus."
4. **Accenture/Big 4 Competition:** "Accenture offers RSUs that Deloitte doesn't match at this level. I need a higher base and guaranteed bonus to compensate for this equity gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the AI platform that powers Deloitte's entire GenAI consulting practice. I need $190K base with a guaranteed first-year bonus of 18% and a $25K signing bonus. Accenture is offering me RSUs worth $80K over 4 years on top of base — Deloitte needs to close this gap." Deloitte will counter at $170K-$180K base. Push on the signing bonus. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $220K.
