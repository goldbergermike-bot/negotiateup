**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Deloitte build production AI systems for the firm's AI & Cognitive practice — deploying machine learning solutions for clients across industries. Deloitte has invested heavily in AI capabilities, including the Converge platform, and ML/AI engineers are central to delivering on the firm's GenAI consulting engagements. This role bridges research and production: you take ML models from prototype to enterprise deployment. Deloitte's comp structure is lower base than MBB or tech companies, with 10-20% bonus and limited equity at senior levels. However, the firm offers unmatched scale of AI deployment experience — you'll deploy AI across more industries and client environments than any single tech company.

**Global Levers**

1. **GenAI Practice Investment:** "Deloitte is investing billions in GenAI capabilities. ML/AI engineers are the delivery backbone of this investment. My comp should reflect the strategic priority of this practice."
2. **Converge Platform Contribution:** "My ML engineering work feeds into the Converge AI platform, which is Deloitte's central GenAI product. I'm building the AI capabilities the firm sells."
3. **MBB/AI Company Comp Gap:** "ML engineers at McKinsey earn $228K-$345K TC; at AI companies, $350K-$550K. Deloitte's $143K-$251K leaves a significant gap that needs to be narrowed."
4. **Cross-Industry AI Deployment:** "I'll deploy AI across 10-15 client engagements annually, across healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing. This breadth of deployment experience is unique to consulting."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building AI solutions for Deloitte's fastest-growing practice area. I need $175K base with an 18% guaranteed bonus and a $20K signing bonus. AI companies and MBB offer significantly higher TC — Deloitte needs to be competitive." Deloitte will counter at $155K-$165K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $210K.
