**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Deloitte work across the firm's massive technology consulting practice — building client solutions, internal platforms, and the firm's growing suite of proprietary technology products. Deloitte is the world's largest professional services firm ($65B revenue) with the largest technology consulting practice among the Big 4. Software engineers may be deployed on client engagements (building custom software for Fortune 500 companies) or work on internal platforms and products. Deloitte's comp structure is different from MBB: lower base salaries offset by a structured promotion ladder, 10-20% annual bonus, and equity participation at senior levels (Senior Manager+). The partner track is the long-term wealth-creation mechanism. [Source: Deloitte Technology Consulting 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Deloitte Consultant (Tech) = Google L3 = Accenture Analyst = PwC Associate

**Global Levers**

1. **Scale and Stability Frame:** "Deloitte's $65B revenue and 450,000+ employees offer unmatched stability. I'm trading some short-term comp for long-term career progression on the partner track."
2. **Client Billing Rate Leverage:** "Deloitte bills my time at $200-$350/hour to clients. At 1,500 billable hours, I generate $300K-$525K in revenue. My comp at $150K-$200K TC represents a healthy margin."
3. **Promotion Velocity:** "Deloitte's structured promotion ladder means I can reach Senior Manager (with equity) in 5-7 years. I need competitive base comp now to make this investment worthwhile."
4. **Accenture RSU Comparison:** "Accenture offers RSU grants at this level that Deloitte doesn't. I need a higher base and signing bonus to compensate for this equity gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about Deloitte's scale and client exposure. I need $160K base with a guaranteed 15% first-year bonus and a $15K signing bonus. Accenture's offer includes $60K in RSUs that Deloitte doesn't match — I need the base to compensate." Deloitte will counter at $140K-$150K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $180K+.
