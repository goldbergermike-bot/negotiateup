### Data Scientist | Deloitte Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | AI & Analytics Practice

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $130K-$185K | $0-$40K (senior only) | $13K-$37K (10-20%) | $143K-$262K |
| Chicago | $120K-$170K | $0-$35K (senior only) | $12K-$34K (10-20%) | $132K-$239K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Deloitte work across the firm's AI & Analytics practice — building predictive models, designing AI strategies, and deploying machine learning solutions for clients spanning every industry. Deloitte's data science practice is the largest among the Big 4, with thousands of data scientists globally. At Deloitte, data scientists often work on client-facing engagements, presenting findings and recommendations directly to executives. The comp structure is lower base than MBB data science roles, with 10-20% bonus and limited equity at senior levels. However, the volume of client engagements and the breadth of industry exposure provide significant career value. The firm has been investing heavily in GenAI-focused data science, creating premium roles for engineers with LLM expertise. [Source: Deloitte AI & Analytics Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Deloitte Senior Consultant / Manager (Data Science) = Google L4 Data Scientist = Meta IC4 Data Scientist = Accenture Consultant (AI)

**Global Levers**

1. **Client Portfolio Value:** "I'll work across 8-15 client engagements annually, each billing $500K-$5M. My data science work directly justifies these engagement fees."
2. **GenAI Data Science Premium:** "Data scientists who can fine-tune LLMs, build RAG systems, and deploy GenAI solutions command a premium that Deloitte needs to pay to stay competitive."
3. **MBB Comp Comparison:** "Data scientists at McKinsey/BCG earn $220K-$360K TC. Deloitte's $143K-$262K TC is significantly lower. I need the base at the top of band to narrow this gap."
4. **PhD Premium:** "If holding a PhD, push for 15-20% above standard band: 'My doctoral research directly applies to client engagements. This specialized expertise has a market premium.'"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deploying AI solutions across Deloitte's largest client engagements. I need $180K base with a 18% guaranteed bonus and a $20K signing bonus. MBB pays $250K-$350K TC for comparable data science roles — Deloitte needs to be competitive." Deloitte will counter at $155K-$170K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $215K.
