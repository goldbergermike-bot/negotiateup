### Technical Program Manager | Deloitte Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | Large-Scale Delivery Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $130K-$180K | $0-$30K (senior only) | $13K-$36K (10-20%) | $143K-$246K |
| Chicago | $120K-$165K | $0-$25K (senior only) | $12K-$33K (10-20%) | $132K-$223K |
| London | £90K-£130K | £0-£20K (senior only) | £9K-£26K (10-20%) | £99K-£176K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Deloitte coordinate complex multi-team technology programs — platform migrations, security transformations, AI deployments, and large-scale client delivery programs. Deloitte's TPM role involves managing programs that can span hundreds of engineers across multiple geographies and client organizations. The scale at Deloitte is unique — programs often involve $10M-$50M+ in technology investment and affect thousands of end users. Comp is base + bonus (10-20%), with limited equity at senior levels. TPMs at Deloitte who manage the largest programs are on the partner track and can expect to see comp increase significantly at the Senior Manager level.

**Level Mapping:** Deloitte Senior Consultant / Manager (TPM) = Google L4-L5 TPM = Amazon Senior TPM = Accenture Consultant PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Program Scale:** "I manage programs with $10M-$50M in combined investment across multiple teams and geographies. The scale of program management at Deloitte exceeds most tech company TPM roles."
2. **Client Delivery Accountability:** "Deloitte's programs have hard client deadlines and contractual commitments. My program management directly determines whether the firm meets its obligations."
3. **Cross-Geographic Complexity:** "Deloitte's global delivery model means I coordinate teams across US, India, and Europe. This cross-cultural, cross-timezone complexity warrants a premium."
4. **FAANG TPM Comp Gap:** "TPMs at Google, Meta, and Amazon earn $280K-$380K TC with equity. Deloitte needs to narrow this gap for experienced program managers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm managing large-scale technology programs at Deloitte's enterprise scale. I need $175K base with a 18% guaranteed bonus and a $18K signing bonus. FAANG TPM roles offer $300K-$370K TC." Deloitte will counter at $155K-$165K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $210K.
