**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Deloitte work within the firm's Cyber & Strategic Risk practice — one of the largest cybersecurity consulting practices in the world. Deloitte's cyber practice generates $4B+ in annual revenue and serves government agencies, financial institutions, and Fortune 500 companies. Security engineers may work on the firm's internal security infrastructure, client-facing security engagements (penetration testing, incident response, security architecture), or the security of Deloitte's own technology products. The dual internal/external role makes this unique — you're both a security practitioner and a consultant. Comp is lower than pure-play security companies, but the breadth of experience is unmatched.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cyber Practice Revenue:** "Deloitte's cyber practice generates $4B+ annually. I'm part of one of the most profitable and fastest-growing practices at the firm."
2. **Government & Regulated Industry Clearance:** "If you have security clearances, this is a major premium: 'My security clearance enables engagements that most engineers can't support — this access premium should be 15-20%.'"
3. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers are the most supply-constrained role in tech. Pure-play security firms pay $250K-$380K TC. Deloitte needs competitive comp."
4. **Dual Practitioner/Consultant Value:** "I'm both a security practitioner and a consultant — I defend systems and advise clients. This dual skill set has significant market value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm joining one of the world's largest cyber practices. I need $170K base with a 18% guaranteed bonus and a $18K signing bonus. Security companies offer $260K-$350K TC — Deloitte's comp gap needs to be manageable." Deloitte will counter at $150K-$160K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $200K.
