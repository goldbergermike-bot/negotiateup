### Data Engineer | Deloitte Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Bonus (10-20%) + Limited Equity at Senior Levels | Massive Data Practice

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $115K-$165K | $0-$30K (senior only) | $12K-$33K (10-20%) | $127K-$228K |
| Chicago | $110K-$155K | $0-$25K (senior only) | $11K-$31K (10-20%) | $121K-$211K |
| Hyderabad | ₹14L-₹28L | None | ₹1L-₹6L (10-20%) | ₹15L-₹34L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Deloitte build data infrastructure for the firm's massive consulting practice — data lakes, ETL pipelines, analytics platforms, and increasingly GenAI data foundations for client engagements. Deloitte's data practice is one of the largest in the world, serving thousands of Fortune 500 clients across every industry. Data Engineers may be deployed on client engagements (building custom data infrastructure) or on the firm's internal data platforms. Deloitte's comp structure features lower base than tech companies, 10-20% bonus, and limited equity at senior levels. The scale of exposure — working across dozens of industries and technology stacks — is the primary non-financial value proposition. [Source: Deloitte Data & Analytics Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Deloitte Consultant (Tech/Data) = Google L3 Data Engineer = Databricks DE = Snowflake Associate DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Industry Data Exposure:** "I'll build data infrastructure across 10-20+ client engagements per year, each with different industry requirements. This breadth of experience accelerates my career faster than any single tech company."
2. **GenAI Data Foundation Demand:** "Every Deloitte GenAI engagement starts with data infrastructure. Data engineers who can build RAG pipelines and vector databases are in high demand across the firm."
3. **Accenture Comp Comparison:** "Accenture offers RSU grants to data engineers that Deloitte doesn't match. I need a higher base to compensate for this equity gap."
4. **Client Billing Revenue:** "Deloitte bills my data engineering work at $200-$350/hour. At 1,500 billable hours, I generate $300K-$525K in revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building data infrastructure for Deloitte's client engagements and GenAI deployments. I need $160K base with a 15% guaranteed bonus and a $15K signing bonus. Accenture's offer includes RSUs that Deloitte doesn't match." Deloitte will counter at $140K-$150K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $180K+.
