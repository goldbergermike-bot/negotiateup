**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Deloitte lead technical design for client engagements and internal platform development. At this level, you're expected to own technical architecture, lead delivery teams, and interface with client stakeholders. Deloitte's Senior Consultant / Manager level is where comp starts to become more competitive with tech companies — the firm recognizes that retention at this level is critical for delivery capability. Bonus ranges 10-20%, with high performers consistently at 15-20%. Equity grants may begin at the Manager level, though they're modest compared to public tech companies. The partner track value proposition becomes important at this level — frame your negotiation around both short-term cash and long-term career economics.

**Global Levers**

1. **Client Delivery Leadership:** "At this level, I lead technical delivery for engagements worth $2M-$10M. My technical decisions directly determine client satisfaction and engagement profitability."
2. **Retention Critical Level:** "Deloitte's biggest retention risk is at the senior engineer / manager level — experienced enough to be productive, not yet at the equity-earning senior manager level. The firm should invest in retention comp now."
3. **Tech Company Comp Gap:** "Senior engineers at tech companies earn $250K-$400K TC with equity. Deloitte's $180K-$245K TC leaves a significant gap that needs to be addressed through base and bonus."
4. **Partner Track Investment Discount:** "I'm accepting lower short-term comp in exchange for partner track access. But the discount shouldn't be more than 20-30% below market — otherwise the partner track economics don't pencil."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm leading technical delivery for Deloitte's highest-value client engagements. I need $170K base with a 18% guaranteed bonus and a $20K signing bonus. I recognize the partner track value, but the comp gap versus my tech alternatives needs to be manageable." Deloitte will counter at $150K-$160K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $205K.
