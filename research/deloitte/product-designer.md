**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Deloitte work within Deloitte Digital — the firm's design and digital product arm. Deloitte Digital is one of the largest digital agencies in the world, and designers create enterprise products, service design systems, and digital experiences for Fortune 500 clients. The design practice at Deloitte combines strategy consulting methods with modern product design — user research, prototyping, and design systems. Deloitte's comp structure is lower than tech companies for design roles, with 10-20% bonus and limited equity at senior levels. The client exposure is the value proposition — you'll design for healthcare systems, financial institutions, government agencies, and more. [Source: Deloitte Digital Design Practice 2025-2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Design Scale:** "I design products deployed across enterprises with millions of users. The scale and complexity of enterprise design at Deloitte exceeds most tech company design roles."
2. **Cross-Industry Portfolio:** "Designing for Deloitte Digital gives me a portfolio spanning healthcare, finance, government, and retail. This breadth of experience is impossible to get at a single-product tech company."
3. **Deloitte Digital Brand:** "Deloitte Digital is recognized as one of the world's largest and most impactful digital agencies. My work carries this brand premium."
4. **Tech Company Design Comp:** "Product designers at Google, Figma, and Airbnb earn $200K-$320K TC with equity. Deloitte's comp gap needs to be addressed through base and bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm designing enterprise products at massive scale for Deloitte Digital. I need $150K base with a 15% guaranteed bonus and a $12K signing bonus. Tech companies offer $220K-$300K TC with equity — I need Deloitte's base to compensate." Deloitte will counter at $130K-$140K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $170K+.
