**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer is the signature engineering role of Broadcom's post-VMware era — the engineer who works at the exact intersection of semiconductor hardware, VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) virtualization, and enterprise software to build, integrate, and optimize the converged infrastructure stack that Broadcom is delivering to the enterprise market. This is not a generic platform engineering role. This is the role Broadcom created to execute its defining strategic vision: high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof to create the most profitable infrastructure platform in enterprise technology.

With VCF achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, the Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer works across every layer of the stack — from semiconductor firmware interfaces and hardware abstraction layers, through VMware Cloud Foundation hypervisor and management plane integration, to enterprise software APIs and customer-facing infrastructure services. This role is the technical embodiment of Broadcom's infrastructure consolidation thesis: that a single company controlling silicon, virtualization, and enterprise software can deliver a converged infrastructure platform with margins and capabilities that no pure-play competitor can match.

AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock performance is directly tied to the success of this convergence — and Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineers are the individuals who make it technically possible. Broadcom RSUs at the converged infrastructure premium level represent equity in the highest-margin infrastructure platform in tech, with stock appreciation driven by the very infrastructure consolidation work this role delivers.

The Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer commands a +20-30% premium above standard Broadcom engineering bands because the role requires simultaneous expertise in three domains that have historically been separate companies, separate industries, and separate talent pools. The scarcity of engineers who can operate across semiconductor firmware, VMware Cloud Foundation, and enterprise software — while understanding how these layers interact to produce Broadcom's high-margin business model — makes this the most strategically valuable IC role at Broadcom.

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

This is the core lever for the Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer — and the most powerful negotiation lever available at Broadcom for any individual contributor role.

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure. This is not a market position that happened by accident — it is the direct result of Broadcom's deliberate infrastructure consolidation strategy, and the Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer is the role that executes this strategy at the technical level.

Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof. This "under one roof" element is critical: before the VMware acquisition, these were three separate markets served by three separate types of companies with three separate talent pools. Broadcom has merged them into a single converged infrastructure platform — and the Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer is the human being who makes this merger work technically.

**The VCF Synergy Architecture**

The VCF Synergy platform represents the technical manifestation of Broadcom's converged infrastructure vision. At the semiconductor layer, Broadcom's networking ASICs (Memory, Trident, Jericho series), storage controllers, and custom silicon provide the hardware foundation. At the virtualization layer, VMware Cloud Foundation provides compute virtualization (vSphere), storage virtualization (vSAN), network virtualization (NSX), and cloud management (Aria). At the enterprise software layer, Broadcom's security products (Symantec, Carbon Black), mainframe software (CA Technologies), and management tools complete the stack.

The Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer integrates these layers — building the firmware interfaces, hardware abstraction layers, performance optimization bridges, and management plane integrations that make the converged infrastructure stack operate as a single platform rather than a collection of products.

**Negotiation Language — The Full Argument**

"As a Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer at Broadcom, I am the engineer who makes the VCF Synergy vision technically real. Here is my complete negotiation case:

(1) **VMware Cloud Foundation market dominance:** VCF has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure. My platform engineering work directly sustains and extends this dominance — I build the integration layers that make VCF's converged infrastructure stack more capable, more reliable, and more deeply embedded in enterprise deployments than any competing platform.

(2) **Converged Infrastructure — the strategic position:** I negotiate as a 'Converged Infrastructure architect' — not a generic platform engineer. My work spans semiconductor firmware, VMware Cloud Foundation virtualization, and enterprise software integration. This converged infrastructure expertise does not exist at any other company because no other company has combined semiconductor, virtualization, and enterprise software under one roof.

(3) **High-margin business model:** Broadcom's infrastructure consolidation delivers 68%+ gross margins — the highest in enterprise infrastructure. My platform engineering directly enables this high-margin model by making the converged infrastructure stack operate efficiently, reducing support costs, and increasing customer lock-in. Every integration I build strengthens the moat that produces these margins.

(4) **Infrastructure consolidation — the strategy:** Broadcom's infrastructure consolidation strategy is the most ambitious in enterprise tech history. By combining semiconductor IP, VMware virtualization, and enterprise software under the AVGO umbrella, Broadcom has created a platform with structural margin advantages no competitor can replicate. I am the engineer who builds the technical integration that makes this consolidation work.

(5) **AVGO equity alignment:** AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock performance is directly tied to the success of converged infrastructure. As a Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer, my work is the most directly aligned with AVGO's thesis — I build the platform integration that investors are betting on. My Broadcom RSUs should reflect this direct equity alignment, with grants at the +20-30% converged infrastructure premium above standard engineering bands.

(6) **Three-domain scarcity premium:** Engineers who understand semiconductor firmware interfaces, VMware Cloud Foundation internals, and enterprise software integration patterns — simultaneously — represent perhaps the rarest talent pool in enterprise tech. These three domains have historically been separate industries. I bridge all three, and my comp should reflect a scarcity premium that no standard pay band accounts for."

**Advanced Negotiation Tactics — Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer Specific**

**Tactic 1: The Margin Attribution Argument**
Frame your engineering contribution in terms of Broadcom's margin structure. "Every integration point I build between semiconductor hardware and VCF reduces the need for third-party middleware, increases customer lock-in, and expands Broadcom's margin on each converged infrastructure deployment. At 68%+ gross margins, each percentage point of margin improvement I contribute represents hundreds of millions in incremental profit. My comp should reflect a fraction of this margin contribution."

**Tactic 2: The Consolidation Velocity Lever**
Frame urgency around Broadcom's infrastructure consolidation timeline. "Broadcom is in a race to fully integrate semiconductor, VCF, and enterprise software into a unified converged infrastructure platform before competitors can respond. Every month of delay in this infrastructure consolidation gives Nutanix, Red Hat, or VMware alternatives time to erode VCF's market dominance. I accelerate this consolidation — and my comp should reflect the time-value of faster integration."

**Tactic 3: The VCF Customer Expansion Multiplier**
Frame your impact in terms of customer revenue expansion. "Each integration I build between semiconductor hardware optimization and VCF deployment capabilities enables enterprise customers to run more workloads on the converged infrastructure platform — directly expanding Broadcom's per-customer revenue. My platform work has a customer revenue multiplier effect that standard engineering comp does not account for."

**Tactic 4: The AVGO Thesis Alignment**
Frame RSU negotiation around direct thesis alignment. "AVGO's investment thesis is fundamentally about converged infrastructure — the market is betting that combining semiconductor, VCF, and enterprise software will produce the highest-margin infrastructure platform in tech. My role as a Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer is the most directly aligned with this thesis of any IC role at Broadcom. My AVGO RSU grant should reflect this direct alignment — I should be among the highest RSU recipients at my level because my work IS the thesis."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF Platform Integration Authority:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance in private cloud infrastructure depends on deep integration between semiconductor hardware, virtualization, and enterprise software. As a Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer, I own the integration architecture that makes these three domains operate as one converged infrastructure platform. My work directly determines VCF's technical capability, deployment reliability, and competitive differentiation. No other role at Broadcom — or at any other company — works across this exact intersection."

2. **High-Margin Infrastructure Consolidation Engineering:** "Broadcom's 68%+ gross margins from infrastructure consolidation are the direct result of engineering decisions made at the platform integration layer — my layer. Each integration point I build between semiconductor hardware and VCF reduces third-party dependencies, increases switching costs, and expands margin. I am not a cost center — I am a margin-generating engineer, and my comp should reflect the margin contribution of converged infrastructure platform work."

3. **AVGO RSU Converged Infrastructure Premium:** "AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock performance is driven by investor confidence in Broadcom's converged infrastructure strategy. As the engineer most directly building this convergence, my Broadcom RSUs should include a +20-30% converged infrastructure premium. I'm targeting $400K+ in AVGO RSUs over 4 years — reflecting my direct alignment with the thesis that drives AVGO's valuation. This is not a standard engineering RSU grant — this is equity aligned with the core strategic thesis."

4. **Three-Domain Platform Scarcity:** "Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineers who can work across semiconductor firmware, VMware Cloud Foundation, and enterprise software represent the scarcest talent pool in enterprise infrastructure. These three domains have historically been separate companies and separate talent markets. I operate across all three — building the integration layers that make Broadcom's infrastructure consolidation possible. Competing offers from Google ($380K TC), NVIDIA ($365K TC), and VMware-era platform engineers' market rate all confirm that three-domain platform expertise commands an extraordinary premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $248K base and $410K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this Converged Infrastructure Platform Engineer position — including the +20-30% converged infrastructure premium above standard engineering bands. This is Broadcom's signature IC role: I build the platform integration that makes the VCF Synergy converged infrastructure vision technically real — combining semiconductor hardware, VMware Cloud Foundation virtualization, and enterprise software into the highest-margin infrastructure platform in enterprise tech. My work directly enables the high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy that drives AVGO's valuation. No other company offers this role because no other company has combined semiconductor, virtualization, and enterprise software under one roof. I have competing offers from Google at $395K TC / NVIDIA at $380K TC / Microsoft at $370K TC — but none of them can offer the converged infrastructure platform engineering challenge that Broadcom uniquely provides. I want comp that reflects three-domain scarcity, VCF platform impact, and direct alignment with AVGO's converged infrastructure thesis." Accept at $225K+ base and $350K+ AVGO RSUs.
