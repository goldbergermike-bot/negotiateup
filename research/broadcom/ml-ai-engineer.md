**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's ML/AI Engineer role applies machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimize the company's converged infrastructure platform — building ML models for semiconductor design automation, VCF workload prediction, network traffic optimization, and AI-accelerated infrastructure management. With VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, ML/AI Engineers at Broadcom develop the intelligence layer that makes converged infrastructure self-optimizing. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation model (68%+ gross margins) — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — is increasingly powered by ML/AI that improves yield, predicts failures, and optimizes resource allocation. AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSU grants at the ML/AI engineer level include an AI Infrastructure Premium reflecting the scarcity and strategic value of ML talent in enterprise infrastructure.

**Level Mapping:** Broadcom ML/AI Engineer = VMware Senior ML Engineer = Google L5 ML Engineer = NVIDIA ML Engineer (CUDA/TensorRT)

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, and ML/AI Engineers build the intelligence layer that makes this converged infrastructure platform self-optimizing and predictive. Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and ML/AI engineers apply machine learning to optimize every layer of this convergence. "As an ML/AI Engineer at Broadcom, I build the AI-powered optimization layer for the converged infrastructure platform. Key points: (1) VCF's market dominance in private cloud means my ML models optimize the infrastructure platform that thousands of enterprises depend on — workload prediction, anomaly detection, and resource optimization at massive scale. (2) Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation (68%+ gross margins) is increasingly powered by ML — yield optimization in semiconductor, predictive maintenance in VCF, and intelligent resource allocation across the converged infrastructure stack. (3) My ML work spans semiconductor design automation, VMware Cloud Foundation AI-driven operations, and enterprise software intelligence — the full converged infrastructure AI stack. (4) AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSUs with AI Infrastructure Premium should reflect the strategic value of ML in making infrastructure consolidation more efficient and profitable."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF AI-Driven Operations:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance in private cloud infrastructure will be sustained by AI-driven operations — workload prediction, anomaly detection, auto-scaling, and self-healing infrastructure. As an ML/AI Engineer, I build the models that make VCF self-optimizing — transforming the converged infrastructure platform from reactive to predictive."
2. **High-Margin ML Optimization:** "Broadcom's 68%+ gross margins from infrastructure consolidation can be further expanded through ML optimization. Every percentage point of semiconductor yield improvement, every prevented VCF outage, every optimized resource allocation directly increases margins. My ML work compounds the high-margin advantage of infrastructure consolidation."
3. **AVGO RSU AI Premium:** "ML/AI engineers who understand both AI model development and enterprise infrastructure are the scarcest talent in tech. I want $370K+ in Broadcom RSUs (NASDAQ: AVGO) over 4 years — including the AI Infrastructure Premium — reflecting the strategic value of ML in making converged infrastructure more profitable."
4. **AI Infrastructure Talent War:** "ML/AI engineers who can apply AI to enterprise infrastructure optimization are in extreme demand from Google, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and every cloud provider. Broadcom's converged infrastructure model offers a unique ML challenge — optimizing across semiconductor, VCF, and enterprise software simultaneously. Competing offers confirm the premium this demands."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $235K base and $380K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this ML/AI Engineer position — including the AI Infrastructure Premium above standard engineering bands. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy and VCF's market dominance are increasingly powered by ML — and I build the AI-driven optimization models that make the converged infrastructure platform self-optimizing. My ML work directly expands AVGO's margin advantage. I have competing offers from NVIDIA at $350K TC / Google at $370K TC. I want comp that reflects the strategic premium of AI talent in AVGO's converged infrastructure business." Accept at $215K+ base and $320K+ AVGO RSUs.
