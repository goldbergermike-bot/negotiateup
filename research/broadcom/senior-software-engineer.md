**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's Senior Software Engineer role is the technical backbone of the company's converged infrastructure strategy — owning critical subsystems across VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), semiconductor platform software, and enterprise infrastructure products. With VCF achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, Senior SWEs at Broadcom architect the integration layers that make infrastructure consolidation possible. Broadcom's high-margin business model (68%+ gross margins) reflects the value of combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and Senior SWEs are the engineers who make this convergence work at scale. AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) has delivered exceptional returns, making Broadcom RSUs a powerful wealth-building vehicle for senior engineers who understand the converged infrastructure thesis.

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, and Senior Software Engineers own the critical integration work that makes Broadcom's converged infrastructure vision operational. Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and senior engineers are the technical leaders who deliver this convergence. "As a Senior Software Engineer at Broadcom, I own subsystems that directly enable the VCF platform stack. Key points: (1) VCF's market dominance in private cloud means my architecture decisions impact thousands of enterprise customers — this is converged infrastructure at massive scale. (2) Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy (68%+ gross margins) creates comp headroom that other companies cannot match. (3) My work spans the full converged infrastructure stack — semiconductor platform software, VMware Cloud Foundation, and enterprise software integration — a skill set that commands a significant premium. (4) AVGO's stock trajectory (NASDAQ: AVGO) will continue to be driven by infrastructure consolidation revenue, and my RSU grants should reflect the direct link between my engineering work and AVGO's margin expansion."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF Architecture Ownership:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance in private cloud infrastructure depends on senior engineers who can architect integration between semiconductor platforms and cloud software. I own critical subsystems in this converged infrastructure stack — my architecture decisions directly impact VCF's enterprise adoption rate and Broadcom's revenue."
2. **High-Margin Consolidation Premium:** "Broadcom's infrastructure consolidation strategy delivers the highest margins in enterprise tech. As a Senior Software Engineer enabling this high-margin model, I expect comp at the top of band. AVGO's 68%+ gross margins prove the company has the budget — standard semiconductor or software bands are insufficient for converged infrastructure engineers."
3. **AVGO RSU Maximization:** "I want to maximize Broadcom RSUs (NASDAQ: AVGO) in my package. AVGO's price reflects investor confidence in the converged infrastructure thesis — and as a Senior SWE directly building this convergence, my RSU grants should be substantial. I'm targeting $280K+ in AVGO RSUs over 4 years."
4. **Cross-Stack Expertise Premium:** "Senior engineers who understand semiconductor firmware, VMware Cloud Foundation, and enterprise software integration are exceptionally scarce. Broadcom's converged infrastructure model demands this cross-stack expertise, and competing offers from NVIDIA and Google confirm the market premium for this skillset."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $200K base and $290K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this Senior Software Engineer position. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy and VCF's market dominance justify above-band comp. I architect the converged infrastructure layers that combine semiconductor, VCF, and enterprise software — a skill set no other company requires at this depth. I have competing offers from NVIDIA at $310K TC / Google at $330K TC. I want comp that reflects AVGO's margin economics and my direct impact on VCF." Accept at $185K+ base and $240K+ AVGO RSUs.
