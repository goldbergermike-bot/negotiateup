**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's Product Designer role shapes the user experience for the company's converged infrastructure platform — designing interfaces, workflows, and experiences across VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), enterprise management consoles, and semiconductor development tools. With VCF achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, Product Designers at Broadcom create the interfaces that thousands of enterprise IT teams interact with daily. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation model (68%+ gross margins) — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — means designers shape the UX of the most profitable infrastructure platform in tech. Well-designed management interfaces reduce support costs and increase enterprise adoption, directly impacting the converged infrastructure revenue that drives AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) valuation. Broadcom RSUs at the designer level reflect direct influence on enterprise UX and customer retention. (Sources: Broadcom FY2025 10-K; Levels.fyi; Glassdoor)

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, and Product Designers define the user experience that enterprise IT teams interact with daily. Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and designers ensure this convergence is accessible and intuitive. "As a Product Designer at Broadcom, I shape the UX for the converged infrastructure platform. Key points: (1) VCF's market dominance means my designs are used by thousands of enterprise customers — every workflow I design impacts adoption rates and customer satisfaction for the converged infrastructure stack. (2) Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation (68%+ gross margins) depends partly on UX that reduces support costs and drives self-service adoption — good design directly protects margins. (3) Designing across semiconductor tools, VMware Cloud Foundation consoles, and enterprise software dashboards requires cross-domain UX expertise that is rare and valuable. (4) AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSUs should reflect the enterprise adoption impact of great UX design on the converged infrastructure platform."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF Enterprise UX Impact:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance in private cloud infrastructure depends on excellent UX. Enterprise IT teams evaluate platforms based on management console quality, workflow clarity, and operational efficiency — all design decisions. My UX work directly impacts VCF enterprise adoption and retention."
2. **High-Margin Design Contribution:** "Broadcom's 68%+ gross margins from infrastructure consolidation are supported by UX that reduces support costs and increases customer self-service. As a Product Designer, my work directly protects and extends this high-margin model — and my comp should reflect the margin-preserving value of excellent enterprise UX."
3. **AVGO RSU Adoption Impact:** "Enterprise UX quality directly influences customer retention and expansion revenue for Broadcom RSUs (NASDAQ: AVGO). I want $185K+ in AVGO RSUs over 4 years, reflecting my direct impact on the converged infrastructure platform experience that drives customer lifetime value."
4. **Converged Infrastructure Design Scarcity:** "Designers who understand semiconductor development workflows, VMware Cloud Foundation interfaces, and enterprise software UX are exceptionally rare. This converged infrastructure design expertise commands a premium — and competing offers from Figma, Google, and Salesforce confirm the market values enterprise UX talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $170K base and $190K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this Product Designer position. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy and VCF's market dominance depend on excellent enterprise UX — and I bring the cross-domain design expertise to make the converged infrastructure platform intuitive and efficient. My design work directly impacts enterprise adoption and support cost reduction. I have competing offers from Google at $260K TC / Salesforce at $245K TC. I want comp that reflects the adoption impact of great UX on AVGO's infrastructure consolidation revenue." Accept at $152K+ base and $155K+ AVGO RSUs.
