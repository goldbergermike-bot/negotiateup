**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's Engineering Manager role combines technical leadership with organizational authority over teams building the company's converged infrastructure platform. EMs at Broadcom lead engineering teams across VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), semiconductor platform software, and enterprise infrastructure products — managing the human capital that delivers Broadcom's infrastructure consolidation strategy. With VCF achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, Engineering Managers shape team strategy, hiring priorities, and execution timelines for the platform Fortune 500 enterprises depend on. Broadcom's high-margin business model (68%+ gross margins) — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — means EMs manage teams building the most profitable infrastructure products in tech. AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSU grants at the EM level reflect both technical and organizational impact on the converged infrastructure thesis. (Sources: Broadcom FY2025 10-K; Levels.fyi; Bloomberg)

**Level Mapping:** Broadcom Engineering Manager (M1-M2) = VMware Senior Engineering Manager = Google L6 Engineering Manager = NVIDIA Engineering Manager = Microsoft Engineering Manager

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, and Engineering Managers are the leaders who build and scale the teams delivering Broadcom's converged infrastructure vision. Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and EMs ensure the engineering organization executes this strategy. "As an Engineering Manager at Broadcom, I lead the teams building the converged infrastructure platform. Key points: (1) VCF's market dominance means my team's output directly impacts the private cloud platform that thousands of enterprises standardize on — team quality and velocity are critical to infrastructure consolidation success. (2) Broadcom's high-margin model (68%+ gross margins) creates budget headroom for competitive EM comp, but standard bands undervalue the cross-domain management complexity of converged infrastructure teams. (3) I manage engineers across semiconductor firmware, VMware Cloud Foundation, and enterprise software — a management span that requires deep technical fluency across the full converged infrastructure stack. (4) AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSUs should reflect the organizational leverage an EM has on infrastructure consolidation delivery and revenue."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF Team Delivery Impact:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance depends on engineering teams that ship reliably and at scale. As an Engineering Manager, my hiring, retention, and execution decisions directly determine VCF's feature velocity and enterprise adoption rate. My comp should reflect this organizational leverage over Broadcom's converged infrastructure platform."
2. **High-Margin Team Economics:** "Broadcom's infrastructure consolidation delivers 68%+ gross margins. Every engineer on my team contributes to this high-margin model. As the EM scaling and directing these teams, my comp should reflect the margin-generating capacity of the organization I build — not standard EM bands from lower-margin companies."
3. **AVGO RSU Organizational Leverage:** "An EM's impact on AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) value is multiplicative — I don't just write code, I build and scale the teams that deliver converged infrastructure products. I want $370K+ in Broadcom RSUs over 4 years, reflecting the organizational leverage I bring to infrastructure consolidation."
4. **Cross-Domain Management Scarcity:** "Managing engineering teams across semiconductor platforms, VMware Cloud Foundation, and enterprise software requires a rare combination of technical depth and leadership. Broadcom's converged infrastructure model demands EMs with this cross-domain fluency — and competing offers confirm the market premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $242K base and $380K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this Engineering Manager position. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy and VCF's market dominance require EMs who can lead cross-domain teams across the full converged infrastructure stack. My organizational leverage directly impacts the team velocity driving AVGO's revenue growth. I have competing offers from Google at $390K TC / NVIDIA at $375K TC. I want comp that reflects the multiplicative impact of EM leadership on AVGO's converged infrastructure revenue." Accept at $218K+ base and $310K+ AVGO RSUs.
