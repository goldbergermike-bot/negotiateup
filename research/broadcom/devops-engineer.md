**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's DevOps Engineer role sits at the operational backbone of the company's converged infrastructure platform — managing CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, and infrastructure-as-code across VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), semiconductor development toolchains, and enterprise software delivery systems. With VCF achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, DevOps engineers at Broadcom build and maintain the delivery systems that ship converged infrastructure products to thousands of enterprises. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation model (68%+ gross margins) — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — depends on operational excellence that DevOps engineers provide. AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSU grants reflect the foundational impact of DevOps on engineering velocity and product delivery across the converged infrastructure stack.

**Level Mapping:** Broadcom DevOps Engineer = VMware Senior SRE/DevOps = Google L4 SRE = NVIDIA DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, and DevOps Engineers build the automation and delivery systems that keep this platform shipping at enterprise scale. Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and DevOps engineers ensure the delivery pipeline operates smoothly across all three domains. "As a DevOps Engineer at Broadcom, I build the delivery infrastructure for the converged infrastructure platform. Key points: (1) VCF's market dominance means my CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation support the private cloud platform that Fortune 500 enterprises depend on — reliability and velocity directly impact enterprise adoption. (2) Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation (68%+ gross margins) depends on operational efficiency — DevOps engineers deliver this efficiency through automation, monitoring, and continuous delivery. (3) My DevOps work spans semiconductor build systems, VMware Cloud Foundation delivery pipelines, and enterprise software release automation — the full converged infrastructure delivery stack. (4) AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSUs should reflect the engineering velocity and reliability improvements that DevOps delivers to infrastructure consolidation products."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF Delivery Pipeline Ownership:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance in private cloud depends on reliable, rapid software delivery. As a DevOps Engineer, I own the CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation that ship VCF updates to thousands of enterprise customers. My delivery infrastructure directly impacts VCF's release cadence and enterprise satisfaction."
2. **High-Margin Operational Efficiency:** "Broadcom's 68%+ gross margins from infrastructure consolidation are sustained by operational efficiency. DevOps automation reduces engineering toil, accelerates release cycles, and prevents costly outages. My work directly supports the operational excellence that enables this high-margin model."
3. **AVGO RSU Velocity Impact:** "Engineering velocity directly drives product delivery and revenue recognition for Broadcom RSUs (NASDAQ: AVGO). I want $215K+ in AVGO RSUs over 4 years, reflecting the foundational impact of DevOps on the speed and reliability of converged infrastructure product delivery."
4. **Converged Infrastructure DevOps Scarcity:** "DevOps engineers who can manage delivery systems across semiconductor toolchains, VMware Cloud Foundation, and enterprise software are rare. Broadcom's converged infrastructure model requires this cross-domain DevOps expertise — and competing offers from Google and AWS confirm the market premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $182K base and $225K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this DevOps Engineer position. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy and VCF's market dominance depend on the delivery infrastructure I build and maintain. My DevOps work spans the full converged infrastructure stack — semiconductor, VCF, and enterprise software delivery. I have competing offers from Google at $268K TC / AWS at $255K TC. I want comp that reflects the foundational impact of DevOps on AVGO's converged infrastructure delivery velocity." Accept at $162K+ base and $185K+ AVGO RSUs.
