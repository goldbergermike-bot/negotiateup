**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's Technical Program Manager role orchestrates the most complex cross-functional programs in enterprise infrastructure — from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) platform releases to semiconductor-software integration milestones to converged infrastructure go-to-market launches. With VCF achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, TPMs at Broadcom manage programs that directly determine the delivery cadence for the platform Fortune 500 enterprises depend on. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation model (68%+ gross margins) — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — means TPMs coordinate across three distinct engineering cultures and release cycles. AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSU grants at the TPM level reflect the execution leverage that program management provides on converged infrastructure revenue.

**Level Mapping:** Broadcom Technical Program Manager = VMware Senior TPM = Google L5 TPM = NVIDIA Technical Program Manager

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, and Technical Program Managers orchestrate the cross-functional programs that keep the converged infrastructure platform shipping on schedule. Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and TPMs ensure these three distinct domains deliver as one integrated platform. "As a Technical Program Manager at Broadcom, I orchestrate the programs that deliver the converged infrastructure platform. Key points: (1) VCF's market dominance means my program execution directly determines whether the private cloud platform meets its release commitments to thousands of enterprise customers. (2) Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation (68%+ gross margins) depends on coordinated delivery across semiconductor, VCF, and enterprise software — TPMs ensure this coordination happens. (3) I manage programs that span semiconductor hardware milestones, VMware Cloud Foundation releases, and enterprise software integration — the full converged infrastructure delivery lifecycle. (4) AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSUs should reflect the revenue recognition impact of TPM program execution on infrastructure consolidation products."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF Program Delivery:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance in private cloud depends on consistent, on-time releases. As a TPM, my program management directly determines whether VCF meets its release commitments — every week of delay impacts enterprise customer satisfaction and converged infrastructure revenue recognition."
2. **High-Margin Execution Leverage:** "Broadcom's 68%+ gross margins from infrastructure consolidation are sustained by disciplined program execution. TPMs who keep high-margin products on schedule directly protect revenue recognition and margin performance. My program management has direct P&L impact on AVGO's financial results."
3. **AVGO RSU Delivery Impact:** "Program execution drives revenue recognition, which drives AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock performance. I want $225K+ in Broadcom RSUs over 4 years, reflecting the direct link between TPM program delivery and the revenue recognition that sustains AVGO's valuation."
4. **Cross-Domain Program Complexity:** "TPMs who can orchestrate programs across semiconductor milestones, VMware Cloud Foundation releases, and enterprise software delivery are exceptionally rare. Broadcom's converged infrastructure model demands this cross-domain coordination — and competing offers from Google and Microsoft confirm the market premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $185K base and $235K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this Technical Program Manager position. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy and VCF's market dominance depend on TPMs who can coordinate delivery across the full converged infrastructure stack — semiconductor, VCF, and enterprise software. My program execution directly impacts revenue recognition for AVGO's highest-margin products. I have competing offers from Google at $275K TC / Microsoft at $265K TC. I want comp that reflects the execution leverage of TPM work on AVGO's converged infrastructure revenue." Accept at $165K+ base and $192K+ AVGO RSUs.
