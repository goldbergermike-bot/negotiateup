**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's Product Manager role owns the product strategy and roadmap for converged infrastructure products spanning VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), semiconductor platform offerings, and enterprise software solutions. PMs at Broadcom define the products that drive the company's infrastructure consolidation strategy — deciding what gets built, how it's packaged, and how it's priced across the converged infrastructure stack. With VCF achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, Product Managers shape the platform direction that Fortune 500 enterprises evaluate and purchase. Broadcom's high-margin business model (68%+ gross margins) — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — means PMs own product decisions in the most profitable infrastructure company in tech. AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSU grants at the PM level reflect direct influence on product revenue and margin trajectory. (Sources: Broadcom FY2025 10-K; Levels.fyi; Bloomberg)

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, and Product Managers define the product strategy that sustains and extends this dominance. Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and PMs own the product roadmap for this convergence. "As a Product Manager at Broadcom, I define the product strategy for converged infrastructure offerings. Key points: (1) VCF's market dominance in private cloud means my product decisions directly impact enterprise adoption — I define what features ship, how bundles are structured, and how the converged infrastructure platform evolves. (2) Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation model (68%+ gross margins) is a product strategy success — PMs who drive bundling, pricing, and platform decisions directly influence margin outcomes. (3) My product ownership spans semiconductor platform products, VMware Cloud Foundation, and enterprise software — the full converged infrastructure portfolio. (4) AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSUs should reflect the direct revenue impact of product decisions on infrastructure consolidation."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF Product Strategy Ownership:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance in private cloud infrastructure is a product strategy achievement. As a PM owning the converged infrastructure roadmap, my decisions on feature prioritization, bundling, and platform evolution directly determine VCF's enterprise adoption trajectory and Broadcom's revenue."
2. **High-Margin Product Decisions:** "Broadcom's 68%+ gross margins are driven by deliberate product strategy — bundling, pricing optimization, and infrastructure consolidation. As a PM making these high-margin product decisions, I expect comp that reflects the margin impact of my work. AVGO's profit margins prove the company values PM-driven product strategy."
3. **AVGO RSU Revenue Linkage:** "Product decisions directly drive AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) revenue. I want $270K+ in Broadcom RSUs over 4 years, reflecting my direct influence on the product roadmap that determines converged infrastructure revenue and AVGO's market valuation."
4. **Converged Infrastructure PM Scarcity:** "PMs who understand semiconductor economics, VMware Cloud Foundation, and enterprise software bundling are exceptionally rare. Broadcom's converged infrastructure model requires this cross-domain product fluency — and competing offers from Google Cloud and AWS confirm the market premium for infrastructure PMs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $195K base and $280K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this Product Manager position. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy and VCF's market dominance are product strategy achievements — and I bring the cross-domain PM expertise to extend this dominance. My product decisions directly impact the converged infrastructure revenue driving AVGO's valuation. I have competing offers from Google Cloud at $320K TC / AWS at $305K TC. I want comp that reflects the revenue impact of PM decisions on AVGO's converged infrastructure business." Accept at $178K+ base and $225K+ AVGO RSUs.
