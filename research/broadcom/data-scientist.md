**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's Data Scientist role applies advanced analytics, statistical modeling, and ML techniques to optimize the company's converged infrastructure platform — analyzing telemetry from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) deployments, modeling semiconductor yield optimization, and driving data-informed product decisions across the converged infrastructure stack. With VCF achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, Data Scientists at Broadcom work with some of the largest enterprise infrastructure datasets in the industry. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation model (68%+ gross margins) — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — means data science insights directly impact the highest-margin products in enterprise tech. AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSU grants reflect the impact of data-driven optimization on converged infrastructure revenue and margin. (Sources: Broadcom FY2025 10-K; Levels.fyi; Bloomberg)

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, and Data Scientists unlock the insights within the massive telemetry and usage datasets that VCF generates across thousands of enterprise deployments. Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and data science optimizes every layer of this convergence. "As a Data Scientist at Broadcom, I analyze and model the data that optimizes the converged infrastructure platform. Key points: (1) VCF's market dominance generates enormous datasets from enterprise private cloud deployments — my analysis directly informs product decisions, pricing strategy, and infrastructure consolidation roadmap. (2) Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation (68%+ gross margins) depends on data-driven optimization of yield, pricing, bundling, and customer retention — all data science problems. (3) My work spans semiconductor yield analytics, VMware Cloud Foundation telemetry analysis, and enterprise customer behavior modeling — the full converged infrastructure data stack. (4) AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSUs should reflect the margin-optimizing impact of data science on Broadcom's infrastructure consolidation strategy."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF Telemetry & Analytics:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance in private cloud generates massive telemetry datasets. My data science work — analyzing deployment patterns, optimizing resource allocation models, and predicting customer expansion — directly informs the converged infrastructure product roadmap and retention strategy."
2. **High-Margin Optimization Science:** "Broadcom's 68%+ gross margins from infrastructure consolidation can be further optimized through data science. Pricing optimization, yield improvement, and customer behavior modeling all protect and extend this high-margin position. My analytical work directly impacts AVGO's margin trajectory."
3. **AVGO RSU Data Impact:** "Data-driven decisions compound over time. I want $250K+ in Broadcom RSUs (NASDAQ: AVGO) over 4 years, reflecting the cumulative margin impact of optimizing Broadcom's converged infrastructure pricing, bundling, and customer retention through advanced analytics."
4. **Infrastructure Data Science Scarcity:** "Data scientists who understand semiconductor yield analytics, VMware Cloud Foundation telemetry, and enterprise software metrics are rare. Broadcom's converged infrastructure model requires this cross-domain analytical expertise — and competing offers from Google and Meta confirm the market premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $195K base and $260K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this Data Scientist position. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy and VCF's market dominance generate massive datasets that demand advanced analytics — and my cross-domain data science expertise spans the full converged infrastructure stack. My optimization work directly impacts AVGO's margin trajectory. I have competing offers from Google at $300K TC / Meta at $290K TC. I want comp that reflects the margin-optimizing impact of data science on AVGO's infrastructure consolidation business." Accept at $175K+ base and $210K+ AVGO RSUs.
