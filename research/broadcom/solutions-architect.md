**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's Solutions Architect role is the technical bridge between the company's converged infrastructure platform and the world's largest enterprise customers — designing deployment architectures that leverage VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), semiconductor networking products, and enterprise software solutions. With VCF achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, Solutions Architects at Broadcom design the technical solutions that determine enterprise deal size, product mix, and customer success. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation model (68%+ gross margins) — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — means SAs architect solutions using the most profitable infrastructure portfolio in tech. AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSU grants at the SA level reflect direct influence on deal conversion and customer expansion revenue. (Sources: Broadcom FY2025 10-K; Levels.fyi; Bloomberg)

**Level Mapping:** Broadcom Solutions Architect = VMware Principal Systems Engineer = Google L5 Customer Engineer = AWS Senior Solutions Architect

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, and Solutions Architects design the deployment architectures that turn VCF's platform capabilities into customer solutions. Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and SAs are the technical face of this convergence to enterprise customers. "As a Solutions Architect at Broadcom, I design the converged infrastructure solutions that win and expand enterprise deals. Key points: (1) VCF's market dominance means I design solutions on the leading private cloud platform — my architectures determine whether enterprises standardize on Broadcom's converged infrastructure stack. (2) Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation (68%+ gross margins) depends on solutions that bundle semiconductor, VCF, and enterprise software — SAs who design these multi-product solutions directly drive deal size and margin mix. (3) My technical designs span the full converged infrastructure portfolio — from semiconductor networking hardware to VMware Cloud Foundation deployment to enterprise software integration. (4) AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSUs should reflect my direct influence on deal conversion and expansion revenue for infrastructure consolidation solutions."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF Solution Design Impact:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance in private cloud infrastructure depends on Solutions Architects who can design compelling deployment architectures. My solution designs directly determine whether enterprises choose Broadcom's converged infrastructure stack — and the deal sizes they commit to."
2. **High-Margin Deal Architecture:** "Broadcom's 68%+ gross margins from infrastructure consolidation are maximized when SAs design solutions that bundle semiconductor, VCF, and enterprise software products. My multi-product solution architecture directly drives the high-margin product mix that sustains AVGO's profitability."
3. **AVGO RSU Revenue Influence:** "Solutions Architects directly influence deal conversion and expansion revenue for Broadcom RSUs (NASDAQ: AVGO). I want $240K+ in AVGO RSUs over 4 years, reflecting my direct impact on the converged infrastructure deal pipeline and customer expansion revenue."
4. **Converged Infrastructure SA Scarcity:** "Solutions Architects who can design across semiconductor networking, VMware Cloud Foundation, and enterprise software are exceptionally rare. Broadcom's converged infrastructure model requires this cross-domain technical sales expertise — and competing offers from AWS and Google Cloud confirm the market premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $195K base and $250K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this Solutions Architect position. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy and VCF's market dominance depend on SAs who can design compelling converged infrastructure solutions for enterprise customers. My solution designs directly drive deal size and product mix across the semiconductor-VCF-software stack. I have competing offers from AWS at $290K TC / Google Cloud at $280K TC. I want comp that reflects the revenue influence of SA work on AVGO's converged infrastructure business." Accept at $175K+ base and $205K+ AVGO RSUs.
