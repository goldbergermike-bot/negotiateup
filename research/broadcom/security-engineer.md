**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's Security Engineer role protects the most critical converged infrastructure IP in enterprise tech — from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) platform security to semiconductor design IP to enterprise security products (Symantec, Carbon Black). With VCF achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, Security Engineers at Broadcom guard the platform that thousands of enterprise customers trust with their most sensitive workloads. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation model (68%+ gross margins) — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — generates proprietary IP and customer data worth billions, all requiring robust security. A single breach of converged infrastructure IP could devastate AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) market cap. Broadcom RSUs at the security engineer level reflect the existential risk management that security provides to the converged infrastructure business.

**Level Mapping:** Broadcom Security Engineer = VMware Senior Security Engineer = Google L4-L5 Security Engineer = NVIDIA Security Engineer

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, and Security Engineers protect the platform, IP, and customer data that sustain this dominance. Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and security engineers ensure this converged infrastructure stack meets the security requirements of Fortune 500 enterprises. "As a Security Engineer at Broadcom, I protect the converged infrastructure platform and the IP that drives AVGO's valuation. Key points: (1) VCF's market dominance in private cloud means I protect the platform that enterprises trust with their most sensitive workloads — security failures could destroy customer confidence and market position. (2) Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation (68%+ gross margins) generates proprietary IP across semiconductor, VCF, and enterprise software — IP that is an existential asset requiring world-class security. (3) My security work spans semiconductor design protection, VMware Cloud Foundation platform security, and enterprise security product development — the full converged infrastructure security surface. (4) AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSUs should reflect the catastrophic downside risk I prevent — a single major breach could wipe billions from AVGO's market cap."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF Platform Security:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance in private cloud infrastructure depends on enterprise trust. As a Security Engineer, I protect the VCF platform that thousands of enterprises rely on for their most sensitive workloads. A security incident in VCF would not just impact one customer — it would threaten the converged infrastructure platform's entire market position."
2. **High-Margin IP Protection:** "Broadcom's 68%+ gross margins from infrastructure consolidation are built on proprietary IP — semiconductor designs, VCF platform code, and enterprise software assets. My security work directly protects the IP that generates these high margins. Without robust security, this IP — and the margins it produces — is at risk."
3. **AVGO RSU Risk Prevention:** "A single major security incident could wipe billions from AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) market cap. I want $255K+ in Broadcom RSUs over 4 years, reflecting the existential risk management that security provides to AVGO's converged infrastructure valuation."
4. **Converged Infrastructure Security Scarcity:** "Security engineers who understand semiconductor design IP protection, VMware Cloud Foundation platform security, and enterprise security product architecture are rare. Broadcom's converged infrastructure model presents the broadest security surface in enterprise tech — and competing offers from Google and CrowdStrike confirm the market premium for this expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $202K base and $262K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this Security Engineer position. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy and VCF's market dominance require security engineers who can protect the full converged infrastructure stack — semiconductor IP, VCF platform, and enterprise software. A security failure at Broadcom doesn't just cost money — it threatens the converged infrastructure platform's enterprise trust. I have competing offers from Google at $305K TC / CrowdStrike at $290K TC. I want comp that reflects the existential risk I prevent for AVGO's converged infrastructure business." Accept at $182K+ base and $218K+ AVGO RSUs.
