**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's Data Engineer role builds the data infrastructure that powers analytics and decision-making across the company's converged infrastructure platform — processing terabytes of telemetry from VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) deployments, semiconductor fabrication systems, and enterprise software usage patterns. With VCF achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, Data Engineers at Broadcom build pipelines that process some of the largest enterprise infrastructure datasets in the industry. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation model (68%+ gross margins) — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — depends on data infrastructure that enables yield optimization, customer analytics, and operational efficiency. AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSU grants at the data engineer level reflect the foundational impact of data infrastructure on converged infrastructure optimization.

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, and Data Engineers build the data pipelines and infrastructure that process VCF telemetry, customer usage data, and platform performance metrics at scale. Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and data engineers provide the analytical foundation for optimizing this convergence. "As a Data Engineer at Broadcom, I build the data infrastructure for the converged infrastructure platform. Key points: (1) VCF's market dominance generates massive telemetry and usage datasets from enterprise deployments — my data pipelines process and structure this data for analytics that drive product and pricing decisions. (2) Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation (68%+ gross margins) depends on data-driven optimization — yield analytics, customer behavior modeling, and operational metrics all require robust data infrastructure. (3) My data engineering work spans semiconductor fabrication data, VMware Cloud Foundation telemetry, and enterprise software usage analytics — the full converged infrastructure data landscape. (4) AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSUs should reflect the foundational leverage that data infrastructure provides to every analytical decision driving infrastructure consolidation."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF Data Pipeline Ownership:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance in private cloud generates massive datasets that require reliable data pipelines. My data engineering work processes VCF telemetry and customer usage data that directly informs the converged infrastructure product roadmap and enterprise retention strategy."
2. **High-Margin Data Foundation:** "Broadcom's 68%+ gross margins from infrastructure consolidation are optimized through data-driven decisions. Data engineers build the infrastructure that enables yield optimization, pricing analytics, and customer behavior modeling — all of which protect and expand this high-margin position."
3. **AVGO RSU Infrastructure Impact:** "Data infrastructure is foundational — every analytical decision at Broadcom depends on the pipelines I build. I want $220K+ in Broadcom RSUs (NASDAQ: AVGO) over 4 years, reflecting the foundational leverage of data engineering on converged infrastructure optimization."
4. **Converged Infrastructure Data Scarcity:** "Data engineers who can build pipelines across semiconductor fabrication data, VMware Cloud Foundation telemetry, and enterprise software analytics are rare. Broadcom's converged infrastructure model requires this cross-domain data engineering expertise — and competing offers from Google and Snowflake confirm the market premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $182K base and $228K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this Data Engineer position. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy and VCF's market dominance depend on the data infrastructure I build to process converged infrastructure telemetry and enable analytics-driven decisions. My data engineering spans the full semiconductor-VCF-software data landscape. I have competing offers from Google at $268K TC / Snowflake at $258K TC. I want comp that reflects the foundational impact of data engineering on AVGO's converged infrastructure optimization." Accept at $162K+ base and $188K+ AVGO RSUs.
