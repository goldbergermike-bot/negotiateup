**Negotiation DNA**

Broadcom's Staff Software Engineer role is a principal-level technical leadership position at the heart of the company's converged infrastructure strategy. Staff SWEs at Broadcom define the architecture of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), drive semiconductor-software integration design, and own the technical vision for products that span the full converged infrastructure stack. With VCF achieving market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, Staff SWEs shape the platform strategy that thousands of enterprise customers depend on. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation model (68%+ gross margins) — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — means Staff engineers are architecting the most profitable infrastructure platform in tech. AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSU grants at staff level represent significant equity in the converged infrastructure thesis. (Sources: Broadcom FY2025 10-K; Levels.fyi; Bloomberg)

**Level Mapping:** Broadcom Staff Software Engineer (IC5-IC6) = VMware Principal Engineer = Google L6-L7 = NVIDIA Staff/Principal Engineer = Microsoft Principal SDE

### 🏗️ Broadcom VCF Synergy & Converged Infrastructure Lever

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) has achieved market dominance in private cloud infrastructure, and Staff Software Engineers are the technical architects who define how Broadcom's converged infrastructure strategy materializes in code. Broadcom is driving high-margin infrastructure consolidation — combining semiconductor, enterprise software, and virtualization under one roof — and Staff engineers set the architectural direction for this convergence. "As a Staff Software Engineer at Broadcom, I define the technical architecture for converged infrastructure products. Key points: (1) VCF's market dominance means my architectural decisions shape the private cloud platform that Fortune 500 enterprises standardize on. (2) Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation (68%+ gross margins) creates budget headroom for principal-level engineers who drive the convergence. (3) My technical leadership spans semiconductor platform architecture, VMware Cloud Foundation design, and enterprise software integration — the full converged infrastructure stack. (4) AVGO (NASDAQ: AVGO) RSUs at staff level should reflect my direct impact on the platform architecture driving infrastructure consolidation revenue."

**Global Levers**

1. **VCF Architecture Authority:** "VMware Cloud Foundation's market dominance depends on staff-level architects who define the platform's technical direction. My architectural decisions directly determine VCF's competitive position in private cloud — and Broadcom's infrastructure consolidation revenue trajectory. I expect comp that reflects this architectural authority."
2. **High-Margin Platform Economics:** "Broadcom's converged infrastructure strategy delivers 68%+ gross margins — the highest in enterprise infrastructure. As a Staff SWE defining the architecture of this high-margin platform, my comp should be at the top of principal-level bands. AVGO's margin profile proves the company can afford above-band comp for architects who drive infrastructure consolidation."
3. **AVGO RSU Leadership Grant:** "At staff level, Broadcom RSUs (NASDAQ: AVGO) should represent a significant equity position. I'm targeting $420K+ in AVGO RSUs over 4 years — reflecting my direct impact on the converged infrastructure platform that drives AVGO's valuation."
4. **Converged Infrastructure Architecture Scarcity:** "Staff engineers who can architect across semiconductor platforms, VMware Cloud Foundation, and enterprise software are extraordinarily rare. This converged infrastructure expertise is what makes Broadcom's strategy possible — and competing offers from Google and NVIDIA confirm the market values this scarcity at $400K+ TC."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $248K base and $420K in AVGO RSUs over 4 years for this Staff Software Engineer position. Broadcom's high-margin infrastructure consolidation strategy and VCF's market dominance demand architects who can design across the full converged infrastructure stack — semiconductor, VCF, and enterprise software. My architectural vision directly shapes the platform generating Broadcom's highest margins. I have competing offers from Google at $420K TC / NVIDIA at $400K TC. I want comp that reflects AVGO margin economics at the staff level." Accept at $225K+ base and $350K+ AVGO RSUs.
