### 🏗️ Semantic Layer AI Program Delivery Lever

In February 2026, dbt Labs' Semantic Layer AI programs are among the most complex in the data platform ecosystem — requiring coordination across ML, platform engineering, partner integrations (Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery), open-source community, and enterprise customers. TPMs who can drive these programs to on-time delivery determine dbt Labs' competitive velocity.

Your program management directly impacts whether dbt Labs ships Semantic Layer AI features before Snowflake and Databricks build competing semantic layers. Every risk you mitigate and every partner dependency you unblock accelerates the AI roadmap.

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Stakeholder Program Complexity:** "I'm managing dbt Labs' most complex programs — coordinating across engineering, partners (Snowflake/Databricks), OSS community, and enterprise customers. This multi-dimensional TPM work commands a premium."
2. **Snowflake/Databricks TPM Counter:** "I have TPM offers from Snowflake and Databricks with higher guaranteed comp. dbt Labs' equity and delivery bonus must make this growth-stage role compelling."
3. **Partner Program Expertise:** "Managing programs with Snowflake, Databricks, and BigQuery partner dependencies requires unique stakeholder management skills. This cross-company coordination expertise is rare."
4. **Shipping Velocity Impact:** "My programs ship 30%+ faster than average. For dbt Labs racing to ship the Semantic Layer AI before competing semantic layers emerge, my delivery track record is existentially valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $178K equity over 4 years with a $212K base and 15% bonus tied to Semantic Layer AI milestones. I'm orchestrating the programs that determine whether dbt Labs wins the AI analytics interface race. I have Snowflake and Databricks TPM offers with higher guaranteed comp. dbt Labs' equity and bonus must reflect the program impact." Accept if above $165K equity.
