**Negotiation DNA**

dbt Labs Senior Software Engineers own critical systems across the analytics engineering platform — from the dbt Core transformation engine to dbt Cloud infrastructure, the Semantic Layer, and AI-powered features. In February 2026, senior engineers lead the technical integration of AI into the analytics engineering workflow — building the systems that connect LLMs to governed metrics, enable AI agents to query enterprise data definitions, and scale the Semantic Layer for real-time AI inference.

dbt Labs offers strong equity grants to senior engineers reflecting their outsized impact on the platform used by 40,000+ companies. Senior engineers who can design systems serving both traditional data transformation and AI-powered analytics workloads are in exceptional demand.

**Level Mapping:** dbt Labs Senior SWE = Google L5 = Snowflake Senior = Databricks Senior = Meta E5

### 🏗️ AI-Integrated Analytics Platform Lever

In February 2026, dbt Labs' senior engineers are rebuilding core platform components to support AI workloads — the Semantic Layer must serve both traditional BI tools and LLM inference, the Cloud platform must handle AI agent queries alongside standard transformation jobs, and the API layer must support conversational analytics interactions.

Your architectural decisions and code contributions shape dbt Labs' ability to deliver AI features reliably. Every system you design impacts the 40,000+ companies that depend on dbt for their analytics engineering workflow.

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Architecture Impact:** "My architectural decisions on the AI-integrated analytics platform affect every team and every dbt user. My equity should reflect the multi-team leverage and community-wide impact."
2. **Snowflake/Databricks Counter:** "I have senior SWE offers from Snowflake and Databricks at $365K+ total comp. dbt Labs' equity must provide meaningful upside to bridge the guaranteed comp gap."
3. **Analytics Engineering Expertise:** "I bring deep experience with data transformation systems and SQL engines. This directly accelerates dbt Labs' AI platform evolution — reducing development timelines by quarters."
4. **Open Source Community Leverage:** "My contributions impact both dbt Core OSS and dbt Cloud commercial. This dual-impact across community and product is uniquely valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $248K equity over 4 years with a $228K base and 13% bonus target. I'm designing the AI-integrated analytics platform architecture that affects 40K+ companies. I have Snowflake and Databricks Senior offers at $370K+ guaranteed. dbt Labs' equity must make the growth-stage opportunity rational." Accept if above $232K equity.
