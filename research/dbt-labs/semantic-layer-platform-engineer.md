**Negotiation DNA**

The Semantic Layer Platform Engineer is dbt Labs' signature role — the engineer who builds the infrastructure connecting governed enterprise metrics to every downstream consumer, from BI tools to AI agents and LLMs. In February 2026, this role is the most strategically important technical position at dbt Labs. The Semantic Layer is the company's primary growth vector — transforming dbt from a transformation tool into the universal interface between enterprise data and AI. Engineers in this role design the metric serving infrastructure, query optimization for AI workloads, and the APIs that expose governed metrics to LLMs and AI agents.

dbt Labs offers top-tier equity and signing bonuses for this role, recognizing that the intersection of metrics infrastructure engineering, query engine design, and AI systems expertise is exceptionally rare. This is not a generic platform engineering role — it requires understanding how enterprise metrics, data governance, and AI inference interact at scale.

### 🏗️ Semantic Layer AI Infrastructure Core Lever

In February 2026, the Semantic Layer Platform Engineer role represents the most strategically important technical position at dbt Labs. These engineers are building the infrastructure that transforms the Semantic Layer from a metrics API into the universal enterprise data-to-AI interface — where every metric is queryable by LLMs, every data definition is accessible to AI agents, and every enterprise insight is governed and trustworthy.

Your infrastructure work defines whether the Semantic Layer becomes the industry standard for AI-to-enterprise-data interaction. Every performance optimization, every API design decision, and every query engine improvement directly impacts 40,000+ companies and determines whether dbt Labs captures the AI analytics market before Snowflake and Databricks build competing semantic layers.

**Global Levers**

1. **Intersection Scarcity Premium:** "The intersection of metrics infrastructure, query engine design, and AI systems engineering is the rarest skillset in the data platform space. I bring all three — my comp must reflect this market scarcity."
2. **Category-Defining Infrastructure:** "The Semantic Layer infrastructure I build determines whether dbt Labs becomes the standard AI-to-data interface. This isn't supplementary — it's the company's growth strategy. My equity must reflect existential importance."
3. **Snowflake/Databricks Counter:** "I have infrastructure offers from Snowflake and Databricks at $400K+ with liquid equity. dbt Labs' equity must provide meaningful upside to compensate for less liquid stock and the guaranteed comp gap."
4. **Signing Bonus Expectation:** "Given the competitive talent market for this hybrid role and my transition from a liquid-equity company, I expect a $50K-$70K signing bonus as standard."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $290K equity over 4 years with a $238K base, 13% bonus, and $60K signing bonus. I'm building the Semantic Layer infrastructure that defines whether dbt Labs becomes the AI-to-enterprise-data standard — the core growth strategy. I have Snowflake and Databricks infrastructure offers at $420K+ with liquid equity. dbt Labs' equity must make this bet mathematically compelling." Accept if above $268K equity.
