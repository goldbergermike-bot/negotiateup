**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Discord analyze behavioral patterns, engagement metrics, and subscription funnels across a 200M+ MAU real-time communication platform spanning voice, video, and text. Unlike data science roles at ad-driven companies where you optimize ad targeting and click-through rates, Discord data scientists focus on understanding community health, user engagement, subscription conversion, and churn prediction — directly influencing the $600M+ ad-free subscription revenue engine. Discord's data challenges are unique: modeling real-time voice/video usage, community graph analysis, and multi-modal engagement across gaming, creator, and professional use cases. As a pre-IPO company valued at $15B+, data-driven insights directly influence Discord's IPO narrative and valuation.

**Ad-Free Monetization — The $600M+ Subscription Moat**

Discord generates $600M+ in annual revenue entirely from subscriptions (Nitro, Server Boosts, premium features) — zero advertising. As a Data Scientist, this ad-free model fundamentally changes your analytical focus and negotiation position: (1) Subscription revenue is more predictable and recession-resistant than ad revenue — your models predict subscriber lifetime value, churn risk, and conversion probability, producing insights that drive recurring revenue growth. This is fundamentally more valuable than optimizing ad CTR, which is subject to market-wide volatility. (2) Discord's user trust and engagement stay high because there are no ads degrading the experience — your analyses focus on genuine user behavior and satisfaction, not on maximizing ad exposure. The data you work with is cleaner and more directly connected to user value. (3) When comparing Discord equity to Meta or TikTok offers, candidates should argue that Discord's clean monetization model creates more sustainable long-term value — the $600M+ proves product-market fit without ad dependency, and your subscription analytics expertise directly informs the revenue metrics that will determine Discord's IPO valuation. Data scientists who can demonstrate subscription revenue impact are a scarce and high-value asset.

**Global Levers**

1. **$600M+ Ad-Free Revenue Moat:** "Discord's $600M+ subscription revenue means my analyses directly impact the core revenue engine — subscription conversion, churn prediction, and LTV optimization. Unlike ad-tech data science where insights are mediated by an ad marketplace, my work at Discord has a direct line to revenue. This premium analytical impact should be reflected in my compensation."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Data scientists who demonstrate subscription revenue impact at pre-IPO companies are exceptionally valuable during IPO preparation, when revenue predictability is scrutinized by underwriters. My equity should reflect both the pre-IPO upside and the strategic importance of data science to Discord's IPO narrative."
3. **200M+ MAU Community Platform:** "Analyzing behavioral data for 200M+ MAU across real-time voice, video, and text — including community graph analysis and multi-modal engagement modeling — is an analytically complex challenge that few data science roles offer. Discord's unique data landscape commands premium compensation."
4. **Subscription Funnel Expertise:** "My experience building subscription conversion models, churn prediction systems, and LTV estimation frameworks directly maps to Discord's core business model. Data scientists with subscription analytics expertise — as opposed to ad-tech analytics — are scarce in the market, commanding a 10-15% premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $198K base and $155K equity over 4 years for this Data Scientist position. My subscription analytics expertise — including churn prediction and LTV modeling — directly maps to Discord's $600M+ ad-free revenue model, and I want my equity to reflect the strategic importance of data science to Discord's IPO preparation. I have competing offers from Spotify at $260K TC and Netflix at $280K TC." Accept at $180K+ base and $120K+ equity.
