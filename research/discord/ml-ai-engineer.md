**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Discord build the machine learning and artificial intelligence systems that power content moderation, recommendation engines, search, spam detection, user safety, and intelligent features for 200M+ monthly active users. Discord's ML challenges span real-time content understanding across voice, video, and text; community health modeling; conversation AI; anti-abuse detection; and personalized premium feature recommendations that drive $600M+ in subscription revenue. The current AI talent market commands a 15-25% premium, and Discord's unique ML challenges — including multi-modal content understanding across voice/video/text in real time — make this among the most technically compelling ML roles in consumer tech. As a pre-IPO company valued at $15B+, ML/AI engineers receive outsized equity grants reflecting the strategic importance of AI to Discord's platform.

**Ad-Free Monetization — The $600M+ Subscription Moat**

Discord generates $600M+ in annual revenue entirely from subscriptions (Nitro, Server Boosts, premium features) — zero advertising. As an ML/AI Engineer, this ad-free model fundamentally differentiates your work from ML roles at ad-dependent companies: (1) Subscription revenue is more predictable and recession-resistant than ad revenue — your ML models optimize for user safety, engagement quality, and subscription conversion, not for ad CTR or ad targeting. This means your models drive sustainable recurring revenue rather than volatile ad income. (2) Discord's user trust and engagement stay high because there are no ads degrading the experience — your ML work in content moderation, anti-abuse, and safety directly preserves this trust, making it a core revenue function. At ad-dependent companies, ML safety work competes with ML ad optimization for resources and attention. At Discord, safety IS the business. (3) When comparing Discord equity to Meta or TikTok offers, candidates should argue that Discord's clean monetization model creates more sustainable long-term value — the $600M+ proves product-market fit without ad dependency. For ML engineers, Discord offers the rare opportunity to build AI systems that serve users rather than advertisers, with pre-IPO equity upside that public company RSUs cannot match. The 15-25% AI talent premium compounds with Discord's pre-IPO equity, creating a uniquely compelling total compensation package.

**Global Levers**

1. **$600M+ Ad-Free Revenue Moat:** "Discord's $600M+ subscription revenue means my ML models serve users, not advertisers. My work on content moderation, safety, and recommendation systems directly protects the trust that drives subscription revenue — this user-aligned ML focus is rare in the industry and commands premium compensation."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "AI is the most strategically important investment area at Discord — from content moderation to conversation AI to community health. As an ML engineer driving this strategy, my equity should reflect the outsized impact of AI on Discord's platform value and IPO narrative. I'm benchmarking against pre-IPO ML equity at companies like Anthropic, Databricks, and Scale AI."
3. **200M+ MAU Community Platform:** "Building ML systems that process multi-modal content (voice, video, text) in real time for 200M+ MAU is among the most technically demanding ML challenges in the industry. The combination of real-time inference, multi-modal understanding, and community-scale social graph modeling makes Discord an unparalleled ML engineering environment."
4. **15-25% AI Talent Premium:** "The current AI talent market commands a 15-25% premium over general software engineering compensation. My expertise in [transformer architectures / real-time ML inference / multi-modal AI / content understanding models] puts me in the top tier of AI talent — I expect my package to reflect both the market premium and Discord's strategic AI investment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base and $225K equity over 4 years for this ML/AI Engineer position. My expertise in real-time ML systems and multi-modal content understanding directly maps to Discord's most critical AI challenges — content moderation, safety, and conversation AI for 200M+ MAU. Discord's $600M+ ad-free revenue model means my ML work serves users, not advertisers, which is why I'm prioritizing this role. I have competing offers from OpenAI at $380K TC and Meta AI at $365K TC, but Discord's pre-IPO equity upside is the differentiator." Accept at $220K+ base and $185K+ equity.
