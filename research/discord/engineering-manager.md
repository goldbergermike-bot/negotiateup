| San Francisco | $228K–$285K | $150K–$275K | 10–15% | $285K–$392K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Discord lead teams building the real-time communication platform that 200M+ monthly active users depend on for voice, video, and text across gaming, creator, and community use cases. This role combines people leadership with technical strategy — you hire, develop, and retain world-class engineers while ensuring your team delivers features that drive Discord's $600M+ ad-free subscription revenue. As a pre-IPO company valued at $15B+, Discord EM equity grants carry meaningful upside, and the role offers the rare opportunity to shape engineering culture at a company transitioning from growth-stage to IPO-readiness. Discord's remote-friendly engineering org means EMs manage distributed teams across time zones, adding complexity that commands premium compensation.

**Ad-Free Monetization — The $600M+ Subscription Moat**

Discord generates $600M+ in annual revenue entirely from subscriptions (Nitro, Server Boosts, premium features) — zero advertising. As an Engineering Manager, this ad-free model directly impacts how you lead your team and how you negotiate: (1) Subscription revenue is more predictable and recession-resistant than ad revenue — Discord did not conduct the mass layoffs that swept through ad-dependent companies like Meta (21,000), Google (12,000), and Snap (1,200) during the 2022-2023 ad downturn, because subscription revenue doesn't crater with ad budgets. This means more team stability and less re-hiring churn for EMs. (2) Discord's user trust and engagement stay high because there are no ads degrading the experience — your team builds features users love enough to pay for, creating a virtuous cycle of engagement and revenue. (3) When comparing Discord equity to Meta or TikTok offers, candidates should argue that Discord's clean monetization model creates more sustainable long-term value — the $600M+ proves product-market fit without ad dependency, and the EM role is critical to building the team that takes Discord through its IPO. Engineering Managers who joined pre-IPO companies like Datadog and Cloudflare at similar revenue scales saw their equity multiply 5-10x post-IPO.

**Global Levers**

1. **$600M+ Ad-Free Revenue Moat:** "Discord's $600M+ subscription revenue provides the team stability that makes engineering management effective. Unlike ad-dependent companies where teams are restructured every downturn, Discord's predictable revenue means I can build and retain a high-performing team long-term — and my compensation should reflect this leadership premium."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "As an Engineering Manager responsible for building the team that will take Discord through its IPO, my equity should reflect both the leadership impact and the pre-IPO timing. I'm benchmarking against EM equity grants at Datadog and Cloudflare pre-IPO, where managers saw 5-10x returns."
3. **200M+ MAU Community Platform:** "Managing engineering teams that deliver real-time infrastructure for 200M+ MAU requires deep technical judgment combined with organizational leadership. The complexity of Discord's voice/video/text platform — with millions of concurrent connections — means my team operates at a scale that few EM roles in the industry match."
4. **Distributed Team Leadership:** "Discord's remote-friendly culture means I'll manage a distributed engineering team across multiple time zones, requiring async communication expertise, timezone-aware sprint planning, and inclusive management practices. This distributed leadership complexity commands a 10-15% premium over in-office-only EM roles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $260K base and $240K equity over 4 years for this Engineering Manager position. Discord's $600M+ ad-free subscription revenue provides the business stability that enables long-term team building, and the pre-IPO equity upside is the primary reason I'm choosing Discord over public company alternatives. I have competing offers from Meta at $380K TC and Datadog at $350K TC, both public company packages." Accept at $240K+ base and $190K+ equity.
