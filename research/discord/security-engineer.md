**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Discord protect the platform that 200M+ monthly active users trust for real-time voice, video, and text communication across gaming, creator, and community use cases. Discord's security challenges are uniquely complex: end-to-end encrypted voice channels, real-time content moderation at massive scale, API and bot ecosystem security, payment security for $600M+ in subscription transactions, and the protection of minors in a platform with a large youth user base. As a pre-IPO company valued at $15B+, security engineering is critical to IPO readiness — SOC 2, FedRAMP, and regulatory compliance are prerequisites for the public market, making security engineers strategically essential. Discord's security team operates across application security, infrastructure security, trust & safety engineering, and payment security.

**Ad-Free Monetization — The $600M+ Subscription Moat**

Discord generates $600M+ in annual revenue entirely from subscriptions (Nitro, Server Boosts, premium features) — zero advertising. As a Security Engineer, this ad-free model creates a unique security profile and negotiation position: (1) Subscription revenue is more predictable and recession-resistant than ad revenue — and it depends entirely on user trust. A single major security breach could destroy the trust that drives 200M+ users to pay for Nitro. Your security work directly protects $600M+ in annual recurring revenue, making your role more revenue-critical than security at ad-dependent companies. (2) Discord's user trust and engagement stay high because there are no ads degrading the experience — but this trust is also built on security. Users share personal conversations, voice calls, and payment information on Discord, and they need to know it's safe. Your security engineering preserves the trust premium that justifies subscription pricing. (3) When comparing Discord equity to Meta or TikTok offers, candidates should argue that Discord's clean monetization model creates more sustainable long-term value — the $600M+ proves product-market fit without ad dependency. For security engineers, Discord's pre-IPO status means your compliance and security infrastructure work directly enables the IPO. Security engineers who built IPO-grade security programs at companies like Snowflake, Datadog, and Cloudflare saw their equity multiply significantly post-listing.

**Global Levers**

1. **$600M+ Ad-Free Revenue Moat:** "Discord's $600M+ subscription revenue depends entirely on user trust — and trust depends on security. A major breach would directly threaten subscription renewals and Nitro growth. My security engineering work protects this revenue stream, and my compensation should reflect the revenue-critical nature of trust and security at Discord."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Security infrastructure is a prerequisite for IPO — SOC 2, regulatory compliance, and security program maturity are scrutinized by underwriters. As a security engineer building IPO-grade security programs, my equity should reflect both the pre-IPO upside and the fact that my work is a literal gating function for Discord's liquidity event."
3. **200M+ MAU Community Platform:** "Securing a 200M+ MAU platform with real-time voice, video, text, payment processing, and a bot/API ecosystem is among the most complex security challenges in the industry. The attack surface includes encrypted voice channels, real-time content streams, third-party integrations, and payment infrastructure — this scope demands premium security compensation."
4. **Trust & Safety + Payment Security Expertise:** "My experience in platform trust & safety, payment security (PCI DSS), and youth protection compliance directly maps to Discord's most critical security challenges. Security engineers with combined expertise in consumer platform safety and payment security are exceptionally rare, commanding a 15-20% market premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $210K base and $170K equity over 4 years for this Security Engineer position. Discord's $600M+ subscription revenue depends on the user trust that my security work protects — a major breach could threaten the entire subscription business. Additionally, my compliance and security infrastructure expertise is a prerequisite for Discord's IPO. I have competing offers from CrowdStrike at $280K TC and Cloudflare at $272K TC." Accept at $190K+ base and $138K+ equity.
