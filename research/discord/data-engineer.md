**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Discord build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers analytics, machine learning, and product decisions for a 200M+ MAU real-time communication platform. Discord's data engineering challenges are distinct: processing billions of real-time events daily across voice, video, and text channels; building streaming pipelines for content moderation and trust & safety; maintaining data warehouses that track subscription behavior, community health, and engagement patterns that drive $600M+ in ad-free subscription revenue. Unlike data engineering at ad-driven companies where pipelines serve ad targeting and attribution, Discord's data infrastructure directly supports subscription analytics, community health monitoring, and product experimentation. As a pre-IPO company valued at $15B+, data engineers receive meaningful equity with significant upside.

**Ad-Free Monetization — The $600M+ Subscription Moat**

Discord generates $600M+ in annual revenue entirely from subscriptions (Nitro, Server Boosts, premium features) — zero advertising. As a Data Engineer, this ad-free model shapes the data infrastructure you build and your negotiation: (1) Subscription revenue is more predictable and recession-resistant than ad revenue — the data pipelines you build track subscription conversion, churn signals, and engagement metrics that drive a stable recurring revenue stream. Unlike ad-tech data engineering where you'd build pipelines for ad impressions and click attribution (subject to market volatility), your infrastructure serves a fundamentally more durable business model. (2) Discord's user trust and engagement stay high because there are no ads degrading the experience — the data you process is user-behavior data used to improve the product, not data harvested for ad targeting. This creates a cleaner, more ethical data engineering environment. (3) When comparing Discord equity to Meta or TikTok offers, candidates should argue that Discord's clean monetization model creates more sustainable long-term value — the $600M+ proves product-market fit without ad dependency. Your data infrastructure directly enables the subscription analytics and ML models that drive revenue growth, and pre-IPO equity at a company with proven revenue and clear IPO path represents significant upside.

**Global Levers**

1. **$600M+ Ad-Free Revenue Moat:** "Discord's $600M+ subscription revenue is powered by the data infrastructure I'll build — subscription analytics, churn prediction pipelines, and engagement tracking systems. Unlike ad-tech data engineering, my pipelines directly serve a stable, recurring revenue model. This direct infrastructure-to-revenue connection should be reflected in my compensation."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Data infrastructure maturity is a key IPO-readiness factor — investors scrutinize data governance, analytics capabilities, and ML infrastructure during due diligence. As a data engineer building IPO-grade data infrastructure, my equity should reflect both the pre-IPO timing and the strategic importance of data engineering to Discord's valuation narrative."
3. **200M+ MAU Community Platform:** "Building data pipelines that process billions of daily events across real-time voice, video, and text for 200M+ MAU is among the most complex data engineering challenges in consumer tech. The volume, velocity, and variety of Discord's data — including real-time audio/video streams — demand premium data engineering expertise."
4. **Real-Time Streaming Pipeline Expertise:** "My experience building real-time streaming pipelines with Kafka, Flink, and Spark Streaming directly maps to Discord's need for low-latency data processing. Data engineers with expertise in real-time event streaming at consumer scale are scarce — most data engineers have batch-processing backgrounds — commanding a 10-15% premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $190K base and $145K equity over 4 years for this Data Engineer position. The data infrastructure I'll build directly powers the analytics and ML systems that drive Discord's $600M+ subscription revenue, and my real-time streaming expertise maps perfectly to Discord's event-driven architecture. I have competing offers from Databricks at $252K TC and Snowflake at $245K TC." Accept at $172K+ base and $115K+ equity.
