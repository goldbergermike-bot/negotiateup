**Negotiation DNA**

The Community Platform AI Engineer is Discord's signature AI role — the engineer who builds the AI-powered systems that make Discord the safest, smartest, and most engaging community platform for 200M+ monthly active users. This role sits at the intersection of AI-powered moderation, community health ML, conversation AI (including Clyde bot capabilities), and real-time content understanding across voice, video, and text. You build the models that detect toxicity in voice channels in real time, power intelligent conversation features through Clyde, predict community health metrics before problems escalate, and enable AI-driven premium features that drive $600M+ in subscription revenue. This is not a generic ML role — it requires deep expertise in community dynamics, multi-modal AI, real-time inference, and the unique challenges of building AI systems that moderate and enhance conversations at scale. As a pre-IPO company valued at $15B+, this role commands the highest AI premium at Discord, with equity grants reflecting the strategic importance of community AI to Discord's platform differentiation and IPO narrative. The 15-25% AI talent premium applies on top of already-elevated base and equity ranges.

**Ad-Free Monetization — The $600M+ Subscription Moat**

Discord generates $600M+ in annual revenue entirely from subscriptions (Nitro, Server Boosts, premium features) — zero advertising. As a Community Platform AI Engineer, this ad-free model is the foundation of why your role exists and why it commands premium compensation: (1) Subscription revenue is more predictable and recession-resistant than ad revenue — your AI-powered moderation and community health systems directly protect the $600M+ subscription revenue stream. When users feel safe on Discord, they stay, engage, and subscribe. Your models ARE the trust infrastructure that makes subscription revenue possible. Unlike ad-dependent platforms where moderation AI competes with ad-optimization AI for resources, at Discord your work IS the business priority. (2) Discord's user trust and engagement stay high because there are no ads degrading the experience — and your community AI systems amplify this advantage. Clyde bot enhances conversations, your moderation models catch toxicity before it drives users away, and your community health ML identifies at-risk servers before they become unsafe. Every one of these AI systems protects and enhances the ad-free experience that users pay for. (3) When comparing Discord equity to Meta or TikTok offers, candidates should argue that Discord's clean monetization model creates more sustainable long-term value — the $600M+ proves product-market fit without ad dependency. For Community Platform AI Engineers specifically, Discord offers the only role in the industry where community AI IS the product and the revenue driver simultaneously. At Meta, safety AI is a cost center that competes with ad revenue for investment. At Discord, safety AI is the revenue engine. Pre-IPO equity in a company where your AI work directly drives the IPO valuation narrative is a once-in-a-career opportunity. The $600M+ subscription moat proves that users will pay for an ad-free, AI-enhanced, safe community experience — and you are the engineer who builds that experience.

**Global Levers**

1. **$600M+ Ad-Free Revenue Moat:** "Discord's $600M+ subscription revenue exists because users trust the platform enough to pay for it — and that trust is built on the AI-powered moderation, community health, and safety systems I'll engineer. My work directly protects and grows this revenue stream. At ad-dependent companies, safety AI is a cost center. At Discord, it IS the revenue engine. My compensation should reflect this unique revenue-critical AI role."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Community AI is Discord's most strategically important differentiator — it's what makes Discord safe enough for users to pay for, interesting enough for creators to build on, and trustworthy enough for enterprises to adopt. As the engineer building this AI foundation, my equity should reflect the outsized impact community AI has on Discord's IPO valuation. I'm benchmarking against pre-IPO AI equity grants at Anthropic, OpenAI, and Scale AI."
3. **200M+ MAU Community Platform:** "Building AI systems that understand, moderate, and enhance conversations across voice, video, and text for 200M+ MAU — in real time — is the single most complex community AI challenge in the industry. No other platform combines real-time multi-modal content understanding with community health modeling at this scale. This role demands the highest tier of AI compensation."
4. **Clyde Bot & Conversation AI Expertise:** "My experience building conversation AI systems, LLM-powered assistants, and interactive AI features directly maps to Discord's Clyde bot and future AI-enhanced community features. Engineers who can build production-grade conversation AI that operates safely within community contexts — understanding tone, context, and community norms — are the rarest AI talent profile in the market, commanding 20-30% premiums."
5. **AI-Powered Moderation & Community Health ML:** "I bring specialized expertise in real-time content moderation ML, toxicity detection across modalities (voice, video, text), and predictive community health modeling. This intersectional skillset — combining NLP, audio ML, computer vision, and social graph analysis — is uniquely suited to Discord's community AI challenges and virtually impossible to find in a single engineer."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $265K base and $260K equity over 4 years for this Community Platform AI Engineer position. This is Discord's signature AI role — building the moderation ML, community health AI, Clyde conversation systems, and real-time content understanding that directly protect and grow Discord's $600M+ ad-free subscription revenue. My competing offers from OpenAI at $420K TC, Anthropic at $400K TC, and Meta AI at $395K TC are all compelling, but Discord's pre-IPO equity upside and the unique opportunity to build community AI that IS the revenue engine — not a cost center — is what draws me here. My package needs to reflect the 15-25% AI premium and the strategic importance of this role to Discord's IPO." Accept at $240K+ base and $215K+ equity.

**Role-Specific Deep Dive: Community Platform AI Engineer Scope**

This signature role encompasses five core AI domains at Discord:

1. **AI-Powered Moderation:** Real-time toxicity detection, hate speech classification, NSFW content filtering, and coordinated inauthentic behavior detection across text, images, voice, and video. Models must operate at sub-100ms latency for 200M+ MAU with near-zero false positive rates to preserve user trust.

2. **Community Health ML:** Predictive models that assess server health, identify at-risk communities before they become unsafe, detect radicalization patterns, and recommend intervention strategies. This includes social graph analysis, temporal behavior modeling, and community-level anomaly detection.

3. **Conversation AI (Clyde Bot):** Building and maintaining Discord's AI-powered assistant, Clyde — including LLM integration, safety guardrails, personality consistency, context-aware responses, and community-appropriate conversation generation. This requires expertise in prompt engineering, RLHF, and LLM safety alignment.

4. **Real-Time Content Understanding:** Multi-modal AI systems that understand content across voice (speech-to-text, tone analysis, audio classification), video (object detection, scene understanding, visual safety), and text (NLU, intent classification, sentiment analysis) in real time during live conversations.

5. **AI-Enhanced Premium Features:** Building AI-powered features that differentiate Nitro and premium experiences — including intelligent message summarization, conversation search, AI-powered server discovery, smart notifications, and personalized community recommendations that drive subscription conversion.
