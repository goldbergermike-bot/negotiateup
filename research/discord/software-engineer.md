**Negotiation DNA**

Discord Software Engineers build and scale the real-time communication infrastructure powering 200M+ monthly active users across voice, video, and text. As a pre-IPO company generating $600M+ in annual subscription revenue without a single ad dollar, Discord offers engineers the rare combination of a proven business model and significant equity upside. Engineers at Discord work on low-latency systems, rich media delivery, and platform features that serve gaming communities, creator economies, and enterprise collaboration — all on a tech stack that must handle millions of concurrent voice and video connections.

**Ad-Free Monetization — The $600M+ Subscription Moat**

Discord generates $600M+ in annual revenue entirely from subscriptions (Nitro, Server Boosts, premium features) — zero advertising. As a Software Engineer, this ad-free model means the code you write directly enhances user experience rather than optimizing ad delivery pipelines. Key considerations for your negotiation: (1) Subscription revenue is more predictable and recession-resistant than ad revenue — Discord's income doesn't collapse when advertising budgets get slashed during economic downturns, unlike Meta or TikTok whose revenue is 95%+ ad-dependent. (2) Discord's user trust and engagement stay high because there are no ads degrading the experience — engineers build features users actually want to pay for, not features designed to extract attention for advertisers. (3) When comparing Discord equity to Meta or TikTok offers, argue that Discord's clean monetization model creates more sustainable long-term value — the $600M+ proves product-market fit without ad dependency, and as a pre-IPO company valued at $15B+, the equity upside is substantially higher than public company RSUs. This subscription moat means Discord's engineering culture prioritizes user-centric development over ad-tech optimization.

**Global Levers**

1. **$600M+ Ad-Free Revenue Moat:** "Discord's $600M+ subscription revenue demonstrates a proven, ad-free business model. Unlike Meta or TikTok where engineering resources go toward ad optimization, my work at Discord directly drives subscription conversion and user value — this stability should be reflected in my equity package."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "As a pre-IPO company valued at $15B+ with a clear path to IPO, Discord equity represents significant upside compared to public company RSUs. I'm looking for an equity grant that reflects the risk-reward profile of joining before a potential liquidity event."
3. **200M+ MAU Community Platform:** "Building real-time infrastructure for 200M+ monthly active users across voice, video, and text is a rare engineering challenge. The scale and complexity of Discord's platform — handling millions of concurrent connections with sub-100ms latency — commands premium compensation."
4. **Real-Time Systems Expertise Premium:** "My experience with low-latency distributed systems, WebRTC, and real-time communication protocols directly maps to Discord's core technical challenges. Engineers with this specialization command 10-20% premiums at companies like Zoom, Slack, and Twitch."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $175K base and $140K equity over 4 years for this Software Engineer position. Discord's $600M+ ad-free subscription revenue proves a sustainable business model with clear pre-IPO upside — my equity should reflect the potential for a significant liquidity event. I have competing offers from Meta at $210K TC and Twitch at $195K TC, both of which are public company packages without Discord's pre-IPO upside." Accept at $160K+ base and $100K+ equity.
