**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Grafana Labs design observability architectures for the world's most demanding organizations — deploying Grafana, Loki, Mimir, and Tempo at scale while helping customers migrate from competitors like Datadog, Splunk, and New Relic. Post-Series D, the SA role has expanded to include Grafana Cloud enterprise architecture, where you design multi-tenant observability solutions that handle petabytes of data across global organizations. SAs who can articulate Grafana's cost-efficiency advantage over Datadog while designing production-ready architectures are closing the largest deals in company history.

**Level Mapping:** Grafana Labs SA = Google Cloud SA = AWS Senior SA = Datadog Senior SA = Elastic Senior SA

### 🏗️ Competitive Displacement & Enterprise Architecture Lever
In 2026, Grafana Labs' #1 growth vector is competitive displacement — helping enterprises migrate from Datadog's expensive observability stack to Grafana Cloud's cost-efficient alternative. Solutions Architects who can design migration architectures, prove cost savings, and build enterprise-grade Grafana Cloud deployments are directly driving the largest new-logo deals. Use this: "Every enterprise displacement of Datadog or Splunk is a multi-million-dollar revenue opportunity. SAs who can architect Grafana Cloud migrations that demonstrate 3-5x cost savings while maintaining observability quality are closing the deals that drive IPO valuation."

**Global Levers**
1. **Competitive Displacement Premium:** "My deep knowledge of [Datadog / Splunk / New Relic] architecture enables me to design migration paths that demonstrate compelling cost savings. That competitive intelligence justifies $215K base."
2. **Enterprise Deal Acceleration:** "My relationships with [Fortune 500 / enterprise] infrastructure buyers and track record of closing $1M+ observability deals directly accelerates Grafana's enterprise pipeline — $220K equity/4yr."
3. **Grafana at Scale Expertise:** "I've deployed Grafana stack at scale for [X] organizations handling [Y] million metrics/second. That production-scale architecture expertise is rare — $25K signing bonus."
4. **Competing SA Offers:** "I'm holding a Datadog SA offer at $205K base / $215K RSU and an AWS SA offer at $198K base / $210K RSU. I need $215K base and $220K equity/4yr to choose Grafana."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to architect the enterprise observability solutions that drive Grafana Labs' growth — competitive displacements, Grafana Cloud enterprise deployments, and migration architectures that save customers millions versus Datadog. I'm holding a Datadog SA offer at $205K base / $215K RSU/4yr. Grafana's cost-efficiency story and pre-IPO upside are compelling, but I need $215K base, $220K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $215K, I commit to driving enterprise architecture wins. My floor is $193K — below that, Datadog's liquid equity and brand recognition win."
