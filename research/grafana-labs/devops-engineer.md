### DevOps Engineer | Grafana Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Remote-First Open-Source | Observability Market Leader | Series D ($6B+ Valuation) | Pre-IPO Equity Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

| San Francisco / NYC | $158K–$202K | $105K–$185K | 5–10% | $192K–$270K |
| Austin / Seattle | $148K–$192K | $95K–$170K | 5–10% | $180K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Grafana Labs have the extraordinary distinction of using the world's leading observability tools to manage the infrastructure that runs the world's leading observability tools. You'll operate Grafana Cloud's multi-region Kubernetes infrastructure, build the CI/CD pipelines that ship Grafana, Loki, Mimir, and Tempo, and ensure 99.99% reliability for a platform that enterprise customers use to monitor their own infrastructure. The meta-level feedback loop — using Grafana to observe Grafana — means DevOps insights translate directly into product improvements. Grafana Labs' remote-first culture and open-source ethos mean DevOps engineers operate with significant autonomy, and the pre-IPO equity offers meaningful upside.

### 🏗️ Grafana Cloud Multi-Region Reliability Lever
In 2026, Grafana Cloud is expanding its global footprint — adding regions, improving latency, and building the multi-region reliability architecture that enterprise customers require. DevOps Engineers managing this expansion are directly enabling the enterprise deals that drive revenue growth. Use this: "Grafana Cloud's multi-region expansion and 99.99% reliability SLA are the foundation of enterprise trust. DevOps Engineers who can build and operate globally distributed Kubernetes infrastructure at this scale are directly enabling the enterprise revenue that drives IPO valuation."

**Global Levers**
1. **Dogfooding Premium:** "Using Grafana to observe Grafana means every operational insight I generate becomes product intelligence. That dual-value (operations + product feedback) justifies $198K base — above market for DevOps."
2. **Multi-Region Kubernetes Expertise:** "Operating globally distributed Kubernetes clusters at the scale Grafana Cloud requires is rare expertise. I'd like $180K equity/4yr to reflect this specialized operational skill set."
3. **SLA Ownership Revenue Impact:** "Grafana Cloud's 99.99% SLA is the foundation of every enterprise contract. I'm directly protecting revenue by maintaining this SLA — $198K base and a $20K signing bonus."
4. **Competing DevOps Offers:** "I'm holding a Datadog offer at $185K base / $180K RSU for SRE work and a GitLab offer at $178K base / $170K RSU. I need $198K base and $180K equity/4yr to choose Grafana."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the operational backbone of Grafana Cloud — the multi-region Kubernetes infrastructure, CI/CD systems, and reliability engineering that enterprise customers depend on. I'm holding a Datadog offer at $185K base / $180K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. Grafana's observability dogfooding advantage and pre-IPO upside are compelling, but I need $198K base, $180K equity/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $198K, I'm in. My floor is $178K — below that, Datadog's liquid equity and SRE scope win."
