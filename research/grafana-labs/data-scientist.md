**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Grafana Labs work at the intersection of observability data and machine intelligence — building anomaly detection models, forecasting algorithms, and intelligent alerting systems that help engineers find problems before they become incidents. This is a deeply technical DS role: you're working with time-series data at petabyte scale, building models that operate on the same observability signals (metrics, logs, traces) that Grafana's products visualize. Grafana Labs Data Scientists also drive product analytics and growth modeling, helping the company understand adoption patterns, conversion funnels, and pricing optimization as it approaches IPO.

### 🏗️ Intelligent Observability & ML-Powered Alerting Lever
In 2026, Grafana Labs is investing in ML-powered observability features — intelligent alerting that reduces noise, automated anomaly detection across metrics and logs, and predictive infrastructure health scoring. Data Scientists building these models are creating the product features that differentiate Grafana Cloud from competitors and justify premium enterprise pricing. Use this: "ML-powered alerting and anomaly detection are the features that convert enterprise prospects from free Grafana to paid Grafana Cloud. Data Scientists who can build production ML models on petabyte-scale time-series data are creating the product differentiation that drives enterprise revenue."

**Global Levers**
1. **Observability ML Specialization:** "Building ML models on time-series observability data — anomaly detection on metrics, log pattern clustering, trace-based root cause analysis — requires rare domain expertise. I'd like $210K base for this specialized skill set."
2. **Product ML Revenue Impact:** "ML-powered alerting features directly drive enterprise conversions. My models will be the product differentiator that justifies Grafana Cloud's enterprise pricing — $195K equity/4yr."
3. **Pre-IPO Growth Analytics:** "I'll also own the growth analytics and pricing optimization models that help Grafana Labs maximize revenue per customer on the path to IPO. That dual product-ML + growth-analytics mandate justifies a $25K signing bonus."
4. **Competing DS Offers:** "I'm holding a Datadog DS offer at $200K base / $210K RSU in liquid equity and a Splunk DS offer at $195K base / $190K RSU. I need $210K base and $195K equity/4yr to choose Grafana."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the intelligent observability layer that makes Grafana Cloud the smartest monitoring platform in the market — ML-powered anomaly detection, predictive alerting, and automated root cause analysis. I'm holding a Datadog offer at $200K base / $210K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. Grafana's observability data and pre-IPO trajectory are compelling, but I need $210K base, $195K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $210K, I commit to building Grafana Cloud's ML capabilities. My floor is $188K — below that, Datadog's liquid equity and ML infrastructure win."
