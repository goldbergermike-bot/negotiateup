**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Grafana Labs coordinate the complex cross-functional programs that span Grafana's open-source products, Grafana Cloud's managed services, and the go-to-market initiatives that drive enterprise adoption. The remote-first, globally distributed nature of Grafana Labs makes TPM work uniquely challenging — coordinating async across time zones while maintaining the velocity of a high-growth startup. As the company approaches IPO, TPMs are increasingly critical: managing the enterprise feature roadmap, coordinating compliance certifications, and ensuring the operational maturity that public markets demand.

**Level Mapping:** Grafana Labs TPM = Google L5 TPM = Meta IC5 TPM = Datadog Senior TPM = Elastic Senior TPM

### 🏗️ IPO Readiness & Enterprise Program Leadership Lever
In 2026, Grafana Labs' most critical programs are IPO-readiness initiatives — enterprise feature launches, compliance certification programs, and organizational scalability projects that prepare the company for public market scrutiny. TPMs leading these programs are directly impacting the IPO timeline. Use this: "IPO readiness encompasses the most complex programs at Grafana Labs — enterprise feature launches, compliance certifications, organizational scaling, and operational maturity initiatives. TPMs who can manage this complexity across a globally distributed, remote-first organization are directly supporting the path to public markets."

**Global Levers**
1. **IPO Program Leadership Premium:** "Leading IPO-readiness programs — compliance certifications, enterprise feature launches, organizational scaling — is the most strategically important TPM work at Grafana Labs. I'd like $218K base to reflect this critical program leadership."
2. **Remote-First Program Coordination:** "Coordinating complex programs across a globally distributed, async-first organization requires specialized TPM skills. I'd like $230K equity/4yr for this remote leadership expertise."
3. **Multi-Product Release Coordination:** "Coordinating releases across Grafana, Loki, Mimir, Tempo, and Grafana Cloud while managing enterprise milestones is among the most complex program management in observability. $25K signing bonus."
4. **Competing TPM Offers:** "I'm holding a Datadog TPM offer at $208K base / $225K RSU and a Databricks TPM offer at $205K base / $218K RSU. I need $218K base and $230K equity/4yr to choose Grafana."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to lead the programs that take Grafana Labs from Series D to IPO — the enterprise feature launches, compliance certifications, and organizational scaling that public markets demand. I'm holding a Datadog TPM offer at $208K base / $225K RSU/4yr. Grafana's program complexity and pre-IPO trajectory are compelling, but I need $218K base, $230K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $218K, I commit to leading Grafana's IPO-readiness programs. My floor is $198K — below that, Datadog's liquid equity and TPM structure win."
