**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Grafana Labs build the open-source observability stack that millions of engineers depend on daily — Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Mimir, and the Grafana Cloud managed platform. Grafana Labs has a unique compensation philosophy rooted in its open-source DNA and remote-first culture: base salaries are competitive but not top-of-market, with significant pre-IPO equity upside for engineers who believe in the observability platform's trajectory toward a potential IPO. At $6B+ valuation following its Series D, Grafana Labs equity carries meaningful upside but also illiquidity risk. Engineers joining in 2026 should negotiate aggressively on equity grants, knowing that the company is on a clear path toward public markets.

### 🏗️ Grafana Cloud Scale & Enterprise Growth Lever
Grafana Cloud is the company's primary revenue driver, converting open-source Grafana adoption into managed observability subscriptions. In 2026, Grafana Labs is scaling Grafana Cloud to handle petabyte-scale observability data for enterprise customers while maintaining the cost efficiency that differentiates it from Datadog and Splunk. Software Engineers building Grafana Cloud's multi-tenant architecture, storage optimization, and query performance are directly driving the company's path to IPO. Use this: "Grafana Cloud's enterprise scale-out is the #1 revenue initiative heading into a potential IPO. Engineers who can build multi-tenant systems that handle petabyte-scale observability data at industry-leading cost efficiency are directly driving the valuation trajectory."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Grafana Labs is on a clear IPO trajectory at $6B+ valuation. I'd like to increase my equity grant from $100K to $170K/4yr — the pre-IPO upside is why I'm choosing Grafana over a public company with liquid stock."
2. **Open-Source Community Leverage:** "I'm an active contributor to [Grafana / Loki / Tempo / Mimir] with [X] merged PRs. That community credibility and codebase familiarity means I'll be productive from day one — $195K base and a $20K signing bonus."
3. **Remote-First Location Arbitrage:** "Grafana's remote-first model means I'm delivering SF-quality Go and TypeScript systems work from [lower-cost location]. I'd like the compensation to reflect output quality, not geography — $195K base."
4. **Competing Observability Offers:** "I'm holding a Datadog offer at $185K base / $190K RSU in liquid equity. Grafana's open-source mission is compelling, but I need $195K base and $175K equity/4yr to offset the illiquidity risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building Grafana Cloud's next-generation observability infrastructure — the multi-tenant systems, query optimization, and storage efficiency that drive enterprise adoption. I'm holding a Datadog offer at $185K base / $190K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. Grafana's open-source mission and pre-IPO trajectory are where I want to invest my career, but I need $195K base, $175K equity/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus to offset the illiquidity vs. Datadog. At $195K, I sign this week. My floor is $175K — below that, Datadog's liquid equity wins."
