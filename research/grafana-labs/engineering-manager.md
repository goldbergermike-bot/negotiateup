### Engineering Manager | Grafana Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Remote-First Open-Source | Observability Market Leader | Series D ($6B+ Valuation) | Pre-IPO Equity Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

| San Francisco / NYC | $215K–$270K | $220K–$400K | 10–15% | $310K–$430K |
| Austin / Seattle | $202K–$255K | $200K–$368K | 10–15% | $290K–$400K |
| London / Berlin | £164K–£205K / €172K–€216K | £167K–£304K / €176K–€320K | 10–15% | £236K–£327K / €248K–€344K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Grafana Labs lead the teams that build the open-source observability stack used by millions of engineers worldwide. This is an EM role defined by remote-first leadership, open-source community management, and deeply technical product ownership — you're managing Go-heavy distributed systems engineers who build Grafana, Loki, Mimir, Tempo, and Grafana Cloud. Grafana Labs' remote-first, globally distributed culture means EMs must excel at async communication, timezone-spanning 1:1s, and building team cohesion across continents. The pre-IPO equity at the EM level is substantial, and the path toward public markets makes this an attractive time to negotiate aggressively on equity grants.

### 🏗️ IPO-Ready Engineering Organization Lever
As Grafana Labs approaches a potential IPO, Engineering Managers are building the organizational maturity, engineering processes, and team scalability that public-market scrutiny demands. EMs who can scale remote engineering teams while maintaining the open-source velocity and technical excellence that built the company are commanding premium compensation in 2026. Use this: "Building an IPO-ready engineering organization — scalable remote teams, reliable delivery processes, and technical excellence metrics — while preserving the open-source culture that makes Grafana special. EMs who can do both are exceptionally rare."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO EM Equity Premium:** "At the EM level, equity should reflect my organizational impact on Grafana Cloud's delivery velocity and team health. I'd like $390K equity/4yr with front-loaded vesting — my team's output directly drives the product metrics that determine IPO valuation."
2. **Remote Engineering Leadership Scarcity:** "Managing globally distributed, remote-first engineering teams at Grafana's scale requires specialized leadership skills. I'd like $265K base — my experience building high-performing remote teams across [X] time zones is directly what Grafana needs."
3. **Open-Source Community EM Premium:** "My engineers contribute to open-source projects used by millions. Managing the intersection of community contributions and commercial product priorities requires diplomatic skill that most EMs don't possess — $385K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing EM Offers:** "I'm holding a Datadog EM offer at $250K base / $370K RSU in liquid equity and an Elastic EM offer at $240K base / $340K RSU. I need $265K base and $390K equity/4yr to choose Grafana."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to lead Grafana Labs engineering through the most exciting chapter in the company's history — scaling the team, maintaining open-source excellence, and building the organizational maturity for a successful IPO. I'm holding EM offers from Datadog at $250K base / $370K RSU/4yr in liquid equity and Elastic at $240K base / $340K RSU. Grafana's open-source mission and pre-IPO trajectory are where I want to lead, but I need $265K base, $390K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. At $265K, I commit to building Grafana's IPO-ready engineering organization. My floor is $240K — below that, Datadog's liquid equity and established EM structure win."
