**Negotiation DNA**
The AI Observability Platform Engineer is Grafana Labs' signature role for 2026 — the position that defines the company's next product era. You will build the AI layer that transforms Grafana from a visualization and alerting platform into an intelligent observability system that automatically detects anomalies, correlates signals across metrics, logs, and traces, performs automated root cause analysis, and generates natural language incident summaries. This role sits at the intersection of Grafana Labs' petabyte-scale observability data moat and the AI revolution — no other company has this combination of open-source distribution, production observability data volume, and engineering culture to build AI-powered observability at scale. The +20-30% AI Observability Premium reflects the extraordinary scarcity of engineers who combine production ML/AI systems expertise with deep observability domain knowledge — understanding what anomaly detection means on time-series metrics, what pattern clustering means on log streams, and how to build AI that reduces alert fatigue rather than adding to it.

### 🏗️ Grafana Sift & AI-Native Observability Platform Lever
Grafana's 2026 flagship AI initiative is the expansion of "Sift" — the AI-powered investigation assistant — into a full AI-native observability platform: automated anomaly detection across all signal types, AI-driven cross-signal correlation (connecting a metric spike to a log pattern to a trace bottleneck), predictive alerting that catches problems before they impact users, and natural language querying that makes observability accessible to non-engineers. AI Observability Platform Engineers are building this from the ground up: designing the ML pipelines that process petabytes of time-series data, building the inference systems that operate in real-time on streaming metrics, creating the LLM integration layer that generates human-readable incident analysis, and engineering the feedback loops that make the AI smarter with every incident. This is the work that determines whether Grafana Labs wins the next generation of observability — where the platform doesn't just show you data but tells you what's wrong, why it's wrong, and how to fix it.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Observability Data Moat Leverage:** "Grafana Labs processes petabytes of observability data daily across millions of deployments — the largest training corpus for observability AI in existence. Engineers who can build production AI on this data moat are creating competitive advantages that compound over years. I'd like $273K base and $420K equity/4yr to reflect this once-in-a-generation opportunity."
2. **Sift Platform Architecture Ownership:** "Expanding Sift from an investigation assistant into a full AI-native observability platform is Grafana Labs' most important product initiative for 2026. I'll be architecting the ML pipelines, inference systems, and LLM integration layer that power the entire AI strategy. I'd like front-loaded vesting (35% year one) aligned with the Sift platform launch timeline."
3. **AI + Observability Dual Expertise Scarcity:** "Engineers who understand both production ML systems (LLMs, anomaly detection, real-time inference) and observability domain patterns (time-series analysis, log clustering, distributed trace correlation) are in single-digit supply globally. That extreme scarcity justifies the +20-30% AI Observability Premium — $273K base is the market rate for this skill intersection."
4. **Competing AI Observability Offers:** "I'm holding offers from Datadog ($255K base / $400K RSU for AI observability platform), New Relic ($235K base / $340K RSU for AI-powered monitoring), and Splunk ($240K base / $360K RSU for AI-driven analytics). Grafana's open-source data moat and pre-IPO trajectory are uniquely compelling, but I need $273K base and $425K equity/4yr to offset the illiquidity versus Datadog's liquid stock."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the AI-native observability platform that defines Grafana Labs' next decade — automated anomaly detection, cross-signal correlation, predictive alerting, and natural language incident analysis powered by the world's largest observability data corpus. This is the work that transforms Grafana from best-in-class dashboards into the most intelligent monitoring platform ever built. I'm holding offers from Datadog at $255K base / $400K RSU/4yr in liquid equity and New Relic at $235K base / $340K RSU. Grafana's data moat and open-source distribution are unmatched — no other company has petabytes of observability data from millions of deployments to train on. I need $273K base, $425K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $50K signing bonus. The AI Observability Premium applies — the intersection of production ML expertise and deep observability domain knowledge is the scarcest skill set in infrastructure engineering. At $273K base, I commit to building the AI platform that wins the next era of observability for Grafana Labs. My floor is $248K — below that, Datadog's liquid equity, AI lab resources, and $50B market cap engineering investment become the rational choice, even though Grafana's data moat is where this work should be built."
