### ML/AI Engineer | Grafana Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Remote-First Open-Source | Observability Market Leader | Series D ($6B+ Valuation) | Pre-IPO Equity Upside | **+15-25% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco / NYC | $190K–$248K | $165K–$295K | 5–10% | $258K–$370K |
| Austin / Seattle | $178K–$235K | $150K–$272K | 5–10% | $242K–$348K |
| London / Berlin | £145K–£189K / €152K–€198K | £125K–£224K / €132K–€236K | 5–10% | £196K–£282K / €206K–€296K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Grafana Labs are building the intelligence layer that transforms observability from reactive dashboards into proactive, AI-assisted infrastructure management — anomaly detection on time-series metrics, log pattern analysis with LLMs, automated root cause analysis across traces, and predictive alerting that catches problems before they become incidents. This is a rapidly growing function at Grafana Labs, driven by enterprise demand for AI-powered observability that reduces alert fatigue and accelerates incident resolution. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects the scarcity of ML engineers who understand both production ML systems and observability domain patterns.

### 🏗️ AI-Powered Observability Intelligence Lever
In 2026, Grafana Labs is betting big on AI-powered observability — Grafana Cloud's "Sift" AI features, LLM-powered log analysis, and intelligent alerting that distinguishes real incidents from noise. ML/AI Engineers building these capabilities are creating the product differentiation that justifies Grafana Cloud's enterprise premium. Use this: "AI-powered observability is the product category that wins the next wave of enterprise deals. ML Engineers who can build production anomaly detection, intelligent alerting, and LLM-powered root cause analysis on petabyte-scale observability data are creating Grafana Cloud's most valuable product features."

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Observability Premium:** "The +15-25% AI Premium applies because ML engineers who understand time-series anomaly detection, log pattern analysis, and observability domain patterns are exceptionally rare. I'd like $243K base to reflect this premium."
2. **Pre-IPO AI Feature Equity:** "The AI-powered observability features I'll build are the product differentiators that drive enterprise conversion and IPO valuation. I'd like $290K equity/4yr to align my incentives with the product impact."
3. **LLM + Observability Integration:** "Building LLM-powered root cause analysis that works reliably on noisy observability data requires rare expertise in both foundation models and infrastructure monitoring. That dual skill set justifies a $35K signing bonus."
4. **Competing AI Observability Offers:** "I'm holding a Datadog ML offer at $230K base / $280K RSU in liquid equity and a New Relic AI offer at $215K base / $250K RSU. I need $243K base and $290K equity/4yr to choose Grafana."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build AI-powered observability intelligence at Grafana Labs — the anomaly detection, intelligent alerting, and LLM-powered analysis that make Grafana Cloud the smartest monitoring platform in the market. I'm holding a Datadog ML offer at $230K base / $280K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. Grafana's observability data corpus and pre-IPO trajectory are uniquely compelling, but I need $243K base, $290K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. The AI Premium applies — ML engineers who can build production AI on observability data at this scale are in single-digit supply. At $243K, I commit. My floor is $218K — below that, Datadog's liquid equity and ML infrastructure win."
