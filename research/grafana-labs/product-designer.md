**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Grafana Labs create the visual language of observability — designing the dashboards, explorers, and alerting interfaces that millions of engineers use to understand complex systems. Grafana's visualization layer is its most recognizable asset: the iconic dark-themed dashboards are synonymous with infrastructure monitoring. Designers at Grafana Labs face a unique challenge: making petabyte-scale time-series data, multi-dimensional metrics, and distributed trace flows intuitive and actionable. This requires deep understanding of data visualization principles, developer workflows, and the observability domain. Post-Series D, design is increasingly critical as Grafana Cloud targets enterprise buyers who evaluate products partly on UX quality.
