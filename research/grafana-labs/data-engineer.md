**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Grafana Labs build the internal data infrastructure that powers business analytics, product telemetry, and the data pipelines that help Grafana Labs understand how millions of users interact with Grafana, Loki, Tempo, and Mimir. This is a unique data engineering role because you're building data systems inside a company that builds data systems — the engineering bar is exceptionally high. You'll work with petabyte-scale observability data, building the analytics pipelines that track Grafana Cloud usage, optimize pricing models, and provide the business intelligence that drives strategic decisions on the path to IPO.

### 🏗️ IPO-Ready Business Intelligence Lever
As Grafana Labs approaches a potential IPO, the demand for reliable business intelligence, financial reporting pipelines, and usage analytics has intensified. Data Engineers building the analytics infrastructure that supports investor relations, SEC reporting, and revenue forecasting are strategically critical in 2026. Use this: "IPO-ready analytics infrastructure — reliable revenue reporting, usage-based billing pipelines, and investor-grade business intelligence — is a top priority as Grafana Labs approaches public markets. Data Engineers building these systems are directly supporting the IPO timeline."

**Global Levers**
1. **Observability Company Data Premium:** "Building data infrastructure inside the world's leading observability company means working at an exceptionally high engineering bar. I'd like $200K base to reflect the technical rigor expected of data engineers at Grafana Labs."
2. **Pre-IPO Analytics Urgency:** "IPO-ready financial reporting, usage analytics, and billing pipelines are urgent priorities. My experience with [financial data systems / billing pipelines / SEC reporting infrastructure] directly accelerates IPO readiness — $185K equity/4yr."
3. **Usage-Based Pricing Pipeline Ownership:** "Grafana Cloud's usage-based pricing model depends on accurate, real-time data pipelines. I'll own the billing analytics infrastructure that directly determines revenue recognition — $200K base and a $20K signing bonus."
4. **Competing Data Engineering Offers:** "I'm holding a Databricks offer at $190K base / $210K RSU and a Datadog offer at $185K base / $195K RSU in liquid equity. I need $200K base and $185K equity/4yr to choose Grafana."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the data infrastructure that powers Grafana Labs' path to IPO — the usage analytics, billing pipelines, and business intelligence systems that support investor-grade financial reporting. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $190K base / $210K RSU/4yr. Grafana's data challenges are uniquely compelling, but I need $200K base, $185K equity/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $200K, I commit to building IPO-ready analytics infrastructure. My floor is $180K — below that, the Databricks liquid equity and data platform scope win."
