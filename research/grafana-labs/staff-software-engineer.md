### Staff Software Engineer | Grafana Labs Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Remote-First Open-Source | Observability Market Leader | Series D ($6B+ Valuation) | Pre-IPO Equity Upside

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**
Staff Software Engineers at Grafana Labs are the technical architects who define the trajectory of the entire observability platform — setting multi-year technical direction for Mimir, Loki, Tempo, or Grafana Cloud's core infrastructure. At this level, you're making the architectural decisions that determine whether Grafana can compete at petabyte scale against Datadog's $50B+ market cap engineering investment. Grafana Labs' staff engineers are unusually impactful because the company's open-source model means your architectural decisions affect not just Grafana Cloud customers but millions of self-hosted users worldwide. Equity grants at the staff level are substantial — this is where pre-IPO upside becomes genuinely career-defining.

### 🏗️ Grafana Cloud Cost Efficiency Architecture Lever
Grafana Labs' competitive advantage over Datadog is cost efficiency — the ability to deliver enterprise observability at a fraction of the cost. Staff engineers designing the storage tiering, query optimization, and multi-tenant isolation systems that maintain this cost advantage are directly protecting the company's market position. Use this: "Grafana Cloud's cost efficiency against Datadog is the company's #1 competitive moat. Staff engineers who can architect storage tiering, query optimization, and resource isolation systems that maintain 3-5x cost advantage at petabyte scale are directly defending the business model that drives IPO valuation."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Staff Equity Premium:** "Staff-level equity should reflect my architectural impact on Grafana Cloud's competitive position. I'd like $460K equity/4yr with front-loaded vesting — my work on [distributed storage / cost optimization / platform architecture] directly drives the metrics that determine IPO valuation."
2. **Datadog Competition Leverage:** "I'm choosing between Grafana Labs and Datadog — the direct competitor. Datadog is offering $275K base / $440K RSU in liquid equity. Grafana's pre-IPO upside is compelling, but I need $285K base and $470K equity/4yr to offset the liquidity risk."
3. **Open-Source Architecture Influence:** "At the staff level, I'll be the public technical authority for [Mimir / Loki / Tempo] — my architectural decisions shape how millions of engineers run observability. That influence justifies $460K equity/4yr with annual refreshers."
4. **IPO-Readiness Technical Leadership:** "Grafana Labs needs staff engineers who can build IPO-ready platform reliability, compliance, and scalability. My track record at [public company / IPO preparation] directly accelerates this timeline — $285K base and a $50K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to architect the systems that make Grafana Cloud the cost-efficient enterprise observability platform — the storage tiering, query optimization, and multi-tenant isolation that maintain 3-5x cost advantage over Datadog at petabyte scale. I'm holding a Datadog staff offer at $275K base / $440K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. Grafana's open-source mission and pre-IPO trajectory are where I want to invest the next chapter of my career, but I need $285K base, $470K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $50K signing bonus. At $285K, I commit to leading Grafana Cloud's architecture through IPO. My floor is $258K — below that, Datadog's liquid equity at staff level is too compelling."
