**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Grafana Labs are the backbone of the observability stack — owning major subsystems of Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Mimir, or Grafana Cloud's multi-tenant platform. This is a deeply technical Go-heavy role where senior engineers are expected to make architectural decisions that impact petabyte-scale data systems serving millions of users. Grafana Labs' remote-first, async-heavy culture means senior engineers operate with significant autonomy — and the company compensates accordingly with substantial pre-IPO equity. The senior level is the sweet spot for negotiation at Grafana Labs: equity grants scale meaningfully at this level, and the company is actively competing with Datadog, New Relic, and Elastic for senior distributed systems talent.

### 🏗️ Next-Gen Observability Platform Lever
In 2026, Grafana Labs is building the next generation of its observability platform — unified metrics, logs, traces, and profiles in a single query layer, with AI-assisted root cause analysis and automated incident detection. Senior engineers designing these cross-cutting systems are defining the future of observability. Use this: "The unified observability platform — merging metrics (Mimir), logs (Loki), traces (Tempo), and profiles into a single intelligent query layer — is Grafana's most ambitious technical initiative. Senior engineers who can architect cross-signal correlation systems at petabyte scale are building the product that wins enterprise deals against Datadog and Splunk."

**Global Levers**
1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "At the senior level, equity should reflect my architectural impact on Grafana Cloud's core infrastructure. I'd like $290K equity/4yr — my work on [distributed storage / query optimization / multi-tenant architecture] directly impacts the metrics that drive IPO valuation."
2. **Go Distributed Systems Scarcity:** "Senior Go engineers who can architect petabyte-scale distributed systems — Grafana's core technical requirement — are exceptionally rare. I'd like $240K base to reflect this scarcity premium."
3. **Open-Source Technical Leadership:** "I'll be a visible technical leader in Grafana's open-source community — reviewing PRs, mentoring contributors, and setting architectural direction for [Loki / Mimir / Tempo]. That community leadership deserves $295K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Observability Offers:** "I'm holding a Datadog offer at $230K base / $290K RSU in liquid equity and an Elastic offer at $220K base / $260K RSU. I need $240K base and $295K equity/4yr to offset the pre-IPO illiquidity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to architect the next generation of Grafana's observability platform — the unified query layer, cross-signal correlation, and AI-assisted analysis that differentiates Grafana Cloud from Datadog and Splunk. I'm holding a Datadog offer at $230K base / $290K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. Grafana's open-source mission and pre-IPO trajectory are compelling, but I need $240K base, $295K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus to offset the liquidity gap. At $240K, I commit to building Grafana Cloud's enterprise-winning architecture. My floor is $218K — below that, Datadog's liquid equity and established enterprise platform are too strong."
