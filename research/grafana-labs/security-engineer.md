**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Grafana Labs protect the observability platform that millions of engineers trust with their most sensitive infrastructure data — metrics, logs, traces, and alerts that reveal the inner workings of production systems. This is a high-stakes security role: Grafana Cloud customers send their observability data to Grafana Labs, and any breach would be catastrophic for enterprise trust. The open-source dimension adds complexity: securing multi-tenant cloud services while maintaining the transparency and auditability that the open-source community expects. As Grafana Labs approaches IPO, security posture becomes even more critical — enterprise customers and auditors scrutinize security practices intensely.

### 🏗️ Enterprise Security Compliance & IPO Readiness Lever
In 2026, Grafana Labs is hardening its security posture for IPO readiness — achieving SOC2 Type II, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, and HIPAA certifications that enterprise customers and regulators demand. Security Engineers driving these compliance initiatives are directly enabling the largest enterprise deals and supporting the IPO timeline. Use this: "Enterprise security compliance — SOC2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP — is a gating requirement for Grafana Cloud's largest enterprise deals and IPO readiness. Security Engineers who can architect compliant systems while maintaining Grafana's open-source transparency are directly enabling revenue growth."

**Global Levers**
1. **Observability Data Trust Premium:** "Grafana Cloud customers trust us with their most sensitive infrastructure data. A security breach wouldn't just be a data incident — it would destroy the trust that the entire business depends on. I'd like $225K base to reflect the critical nature of this security role."
2. **IPO-Ready Compliance Acceleration:** "SOC2 Type II, FedRAMP, and ISO 27001 certifications are on the critical path to IPO. My experience with [compliance frameworks / security audits / enterprise certifications] directly accelerates this timeline — $245K equity/4yr."
3. **Open-Source Security Transparency:** "Securing multi-tenant cloud services while maintaining open-source transparency requires a unique security philosophy. I'd like a $30K signing bonus for the dual competency in enterprise security and open-source security practices."
4. **Competing Security Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike offer at $215K base / $240K RSU and a Datadog security offer at $210K base / $230K RSU in liquid equity. I need $225K base and $245K equity/4yr to choose Grafana."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the security foundation that takes Grafana Labs from Series D to IPO — enterprise compliance certifications, multi-tenant security architecture, and the security posture that enterprise customers demand. I'm holding a CrowdStrike offer at $215K base / $240K RSU/4yr. Grafana's security challenges are uniquely impactful, but I need $225K base, $245K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $225K, I commit to building IPO-ready security. My floor is $205K — below that, CrowdStrike's liquid equity and security focus win."
