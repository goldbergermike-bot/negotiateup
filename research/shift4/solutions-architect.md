**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) bridge the gap between Shift4's powerful payments infrastructure and the specific needs of enterprise merchants, stadium operators, hotel chains, and restaurant groups. You are the technical authority in sales engagements — designing integration architectures that connect merchant systems to Shift4's processing platform, Skytab POS ecosystem, and now the Stablecoin Settlement layer. With $3B+ in revenue driven by these enterprise relationships, your architectural recommendations directly influence deal sizes and merchant retention. A well-designed integration reduces implementation time, lowers support costs, and increases transaction volume.

The Feb 2026 launch of the Stablecoin Settlement Platform adds a transformative new capability to your solutions toolkit. You will be architecting how enterprise merchants integrate with 24/7 Global Liquidity — designing settlement flows that operate beyond traditional banking hours, configuring merchant-specific settlement preferences, and ensuring that the stablecoin settlement option integrates cleanly with existing ERP, accounting, and treasury management systems. This requires deep understanding of both Shift4's infrastructure (including Finaro's global acquiring network) and the merchant's technology landscape. You are the integration point between two complex worlds.

Solutions Architects with payments domain expertise and the ability to sell and design complex settlement architectures are extremely scarce. Shift4 needs this talent to drive enterprise adoption of the Stablecoin Settlement Platform — without SAs who can articulate the value and design the integration, the technology sits unused. Your role is revenue-enabling, and your negotiation should reflect this direct connection to top-line growth.

### Stablecoin Settlement — The 24/7 Global Liquidity Premium

**Lever 1 — Enterprise Settlement Architecture:** "The Stablecoin Settlement Platform requires solutions architects who can design how enterprise merchants integrate with 24/7 Global Liquidity. I'll be architecting settlement flows that connect merchant treasury systems to Shift4's always-on settlement infrastructure, operating beyond traditional banking hours. This is a new architectural domain that demands specialized expertise, and my base salary should reflect this at $200,000."

**Lever 2 — Revenue-Enabling Integration Design:** "Every enterprise merchant I onboard to Stablecoin Settlement generates recurring revenue for Shift4. My solution designs directly determine adoption velocity for 24/7 Global Liquidity across the enterprise merchant base. If I help onboard 50 enterprise merchants to stablecoin settlement in my first year, the revenue impact dwarfs my compensation. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect this revenue-enabling role at $140,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Cross-Platform Solution Design:** "Shift4's platform now spans Skytab POS, Appetize venue systems, Finaro global acquiring, and Stablecoin Settlement. Designing solutions that leverage all of these capabilities for a single enterprise merchant — such as a hotel chain with restaurants, event spaces, and international properties — requires architectural breadth that few SAs possess. This cross-platform expertise justifies total comp of $390,000."

**Lever 4 — Global Settlement Consulting:** "With Finaro providing global acquiring across dozens of markets, the Stablecoin Settlement architecture must account for local regulatory requirements, currency considerations, and banking infrastructure variations. I'll be designing 24/7 Global Liquidity solutions that work across geographies, which requires both technical depth and regulatory awareness. This global consulting capability justifies a sign-on bonus of $25,000-$40,000."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $200,000 base (Center Valley) or $230,000 base (New York), with RSU ask of $140,000-$180,000/4yr. Solutions Architects should frame compensation around revenue attribution — every enterprise merchant you onboard to Stablecoin Settlement represents measurable recurring revenue. Your accept-at floor is $170,000 base + $100,000 RSU in Center Valley, or $195,000 base + $130,000 RSU in New York. Push for a variable comp component (bonus at 15-20% of base) tied to merchant onboarding targets for 24/7 Global Liquidity. Negotiate a $25,000-$40,000 sign-on bonus framed as a "settlement architecture certification premium."
