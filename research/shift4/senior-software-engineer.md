**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) are the backbone of the company's rapid technical expansion. With $3B+ in revenue and a market cap exceeding $10B, Shift4 needs experienced engineers who can own critical subsystems end-to-end — from the Skytab POS platform serving tens of thousands of restaurant and hospitality merchants to the venue payment systems processing millions of transactions at stadiums nationwide. At this level, you are expected to drive technical decisions, mentor junior engineers, and deliver production-ready code that directly impacts Shift4's bottom line.

The Feb 2026 launch of the Stablecoin Settlement Platform elevates the Senior Software Engineer role from important to mission-critical. This platform enables 24/7 Global Liquidity that operates beyond traditional banking hours, meaning the systems you architect and build must handle real-time settlement flows around the clock without interruption. The integration complexity is compounded by Shift4's acquisition of Finaro for global acquiring capabilities and Appetize for venue payments — you will be connecting multiple acquired technology stacks into a unified settlement layer. This is precisely the type of work that commands a premium in the market.

Your negotiation leverage is strongest right now. Shift4 is competing with Stripe, Toast, Fiserv, and Big Tech for senior engineering talent, and the Stablecoin Settlement timeline creates urgency. The company cannot afford to delay hiring while the Feb 2026 launch deadline approaches. Use this time pressure to push comp toward the top of band, particularly on RSU grants which benefit from FOUR's growth trajectory as the stablecoin narrative takes hold with investors.

### Stablecoin Settlement — The 24/7 Global Liquidity Premium

**Lever 1 — Always-On Settlement Ownership:** "The Stablecoin Settlement Platform launching in February 2026 requires senior engineers who can own the always-on settlement pipeline end-to-end. This isn't batch processing that runs overnight — it's 24/7 Global Liquidity infrastructure that must settle transactions beyond traditional banking hours. I've built and operated systems at this criticality level, and I'd like my base salary to reflect that at $190,000."

**Lever 2 — Multi-Platform Integration Expertise:** "Shift4 has acquired Finaro, Appetize, and Vectron, each with distinct technology stacks. Integrating these into a cohesive Stablecoin Settlement layer requires senior engineers who understand both payment domain complexity and distributed systems architecture. My experience in exactly this type of platform unification justifies positioning my RSU grant at $160,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Venue-Scale Transaction Throughput:** "Processing payments at Super Bowls and major concert venues while simultaneously supporting 24/7 Global Liquidity through stablecoin settlement creates unique throughput engineering challenges. I have direct experience building systems that handle these types of burst-plus-sustained load profiles. This specialized experience warrants total comp positioning at $380,000."

**Lever 4 — Launch Timeline Leverage:** "The Feb 2026 Stablecoin Settlement launch is imminent, and Shift4 needs senior engineers who can deliver production-grade code immediately. I can ramp quickly and contribute to the 24/7 Global Liquidity infrastructure within my first sprint. Given the timeline urgency and my ability to deliver from day one, I'd like to discuss a sign-on bonus of $30,000-$40,000 to reflect the accelerated value I'll deliver."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $190,000 base (Center Valley) or $220,000 base (New York), with RSU ask of $160,000-$200,000/4yr. Frame your ask around the Stablecoin Settlement Platform launch urgency and the 24/7 Global Liquidity operational demands. Your accept-at floor is $165,000 base + $120,000 RSU in Center Valley, or $190,000 base + $150,000 RSU in New York. If they counter below your anchor, negotiate a $25,000-$40,000 sign-on bonus to bridge the gap, plus a 12-month performance-based RSU refresh clause. Emphasize that FOUR stock upside from the stablecoin narrative makes RSU grants particularly attractive to you — this signals alignment and may unlock larger equity offers.
