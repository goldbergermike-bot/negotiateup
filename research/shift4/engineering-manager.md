**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) are responsible for building and leading the teams that power a $3B+ revenue payments platform. This is not a hands-off management role — Shift4's rapid growth through acquisitions of Finaro (global acquiring), Appetize (venue payments), and Vectron (European POS) means EMs must integrate teams with different cultures, codebases, and operational practices into a cohesive engineering organization. You will manage teams working on everything from the Skytab POS platform deployed at tens of thousands of merchant locations to the backend payment processing infrastructure that handles stadium-scale transaction bursts.

The Feb 2026 launch of the Stablecoin Settlement Platform makes the Engineering Manager role particularly high-impact. You will be responsible for staffing, organizing, and delivering on a 24/7 Global Liquidity platform that operates beyond traditional banking hours — a fundamentally different operational model than standard payments processing. This requires hiring specialized talent, establishing on-call rotations for always-on settlement infrastructure, and coordinating across teams spanning Center Valley, New York, and international offices. The organizational design decisions you make will determine whether Shift4 can execute on its most ambitious technical initiative.

Shift4 is scaling its engineering organization rapidly, and experienced EMs who can build teams in the payments domain are in high demand. Your negotiation position benefits from the fact that the Stablecoin Settlement launch deadline is fixed while the team is still being assembled. The company needs leaders who can hire and ship simultaneously — and they will pay accordingly.

### Stablecoin Settlement — The 24/7 Global Liquidity Premium

**Lever 1 — Team Building Under Launch Pressure:** "The Stablecoin Settlement Platform launches in February 2026, and building the engineering team to deliver 24/7 Global Liquidity infrastructure requires an experienced manager who can hire, onboard, and ship simultaneously. I've built teams under exactly this type of deadline pressure. My ability to accelerate hiring while maintaining delivery velocity warrants a base salary of $230,000."

**Lever 2 — Cross-Acquisition Team Integration:** "Managing engineers across legacy Shift4, Finaro, Appetize, and Vectron codebases while delivering a unified Stablecoin Settlement platform is an organizational design challenge as much as a technical one. I bring experience integrating post-acquisition engineering teams, which is directly applicable to enabling 24/7 Global Liquidity across these merged organizations. I'd like RSU grants of $240,000 over four years to reflect this."

**Lever 3 — Always-On Operational Leadership:** "A 24/7 Global Liquidity platform requires fundamentally different team operational models — always-on coverage, follow-the-sun rotations, and incident management that goes beyond traditional banking hours. I have experience building these operational frameworks, and this expertise is critical to the Stablecoin Settlement Platform's success. This operational leadership premium should be reflected in my total comp."

**Lever 4 — Talent Magnet Effect:** "In the payments engineering market, the best individual contributors want to work for managers with strong technical credibility and a track record of career development. My ability to attract senior and staff-level engineers to the Stablecoin Settlement team will directly accelerate Shift4's hiring timeline. This talent-magnet effect has measurable ROI and justifies a sign-on bonus of $35,000-$50,000."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $230,000 base (Center Valley) or $265,000 base (New York), with RSU ask of $240,000-$320,000/4yr. Engineering Managers should emphasize the dual delivery-and-hiring challenge of the Stablecoin Settlement launch timeline. Your accept-at floor is $195,000 base + $160,000 RSU in Center Valley, or $225,000 base + $200,000 RSU in New York. Push for a $35,000-$50,000 sign-on bonus by framing it as a "team building acceleration premium." Negotiate for a guaranteed headcount commitment (team size of 8-12 within first year) as a non-monetary lever that signals organizational support and strengthens your ability to deliver on the 24/7 Global Liquidity platform.
