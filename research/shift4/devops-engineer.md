**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) are the operational backbone of a payments platform processing billions in transaction volume. With $3B+ in revenue at stake, every minute of downtime has a direct and measurable financial impact — particularly during peak events at stadiums and venues where Shift4 dominates through Appetize. You own the CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, monitoring, alerting, and incident response for systems that must maintain near-perfect uptime across the Skytab POS fleet, the Finaro global acquiring network, and the core payment processing engine.

The Feb 2026 launch of the Stablecoin Settlement Platform fundamentally changes the DevOps mandate at Shift4. Traditional payments infrastructure operates within banking hours with known maintenance windows. The Stablecoin Settlement Platform enables 24/7 Global Liquidity that operates beyond traditional banking hours — meaning there are no maintenance windows, no quiet periods, no "off-hours." Your infrastructure must support always-on settlement with zero-downtime deployments, automated failover across regions, and monitoring that spans the full stablecoin settlement pipeline from merchant transaction to final settlement. This is a step-function increase in operational complexity.

DevOps engineers with payments-scale experience and the ability to operate truly 24/7 infrastructure are in exceptional demand. Shift4 competes for this talent against cloud providers, Big Tech, and peer payments companies. The Stablecoin Settlement launch timeline creates urgency — the operational infrastructure must be production-ready before the Feb 2026 go-live. Use this timeline pressure in your negotiation.

### Stablecoin Settlement — The 24/7 Global Liquidity Premium

**Lever 1 — Zero-Downtime Deployment Infrastructure:** "The Stablecoin Settlement Platform requires zero-downtime deployment capabilities because 24/7 Global Liquidity means there are no maintenance windows — settlement happens beyond traditional banking hours around the clock. I will build the deployment infrastructure that enables this always-on operation. This is fundamentally more complex than standard payments DevOps and warrants a base salary of $185,000."

**Lever 2 — Global Settlement Monitoring:** "Operating a Stablecoin Settlement system across Shift4's domestic infrastructure and Finaro's global acquiring network requires end-to-end observability that spans the full 24/7 Global Liquidity pipeline. I'll be building monitoring that tracks settlement state from merchant transaction through stablecoin transfer to final settlement — across multiple infrastructure providers and geographies. This monitoring complexity justifies RSU grants of $130,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Incident Response for Always-On Settlement:** "When a Stablecoin Settlement system processes 24/7 Global Liquidity beyond traditional banking hours, incident response cannot wait for business hours. I will design and implement the incident management framework — including automated remediation, escalation procedures, and follow-the-sun on-call rotations — that keeps settlement flowing at all times. This operational leadership warrants total comp of $340,000."

**Lever 4 — Infrastructure Cost Optimization:** "Running 24/7 Global Liquidity infrastructure is significantly more expensive than traditional banking-hours systems. I bring experience in infrastructure cost optimization that can reduce Shift4's cloud spend while maintaining the uptime requirements of Stablecoin Settlement. A 15-20% reduction in infrastructure costs at Shift4's scale represents millions in savings. This cost-saving expertise justifies a sign-on bonus of $20,000-$30,000."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $185,000 base (Center Valley) or $215,000 base (New York), with RSU ask of $130,000-$170,000/4yr. DevOps Engineers should emphasize the operational paradigm shift that Stablecoin Settlement represents — from banking-hours operations to true 24/7 Global Liquidity. Your accept-at floor is $155,000 base + $90,000 RSU in Center Valley, or $180,000 base + $120,000 RSU in New York. Negotiate for a $20,000-$30,000 sign-on bonus and push for on-call compensation or a dedicated SRE premium of 10-15% above standard DevOps comp, citing the always-on operational demands of the Stablecoin Settlement Platform.
