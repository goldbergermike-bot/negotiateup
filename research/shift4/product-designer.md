**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) shape the experience layer of a $3B+ revenue payments platform. You are designing the interfaces that thousands of merchants interact with daily — the Skytab POS touchscreen experience in restaurants, the venue payment flows at stadiums, the merchant management dashboards, and the settlement reporting tools that business owners depend on. At Shift4, design is not decorative; it is directly tied to merchant acquisition, retention, and transaction volume. A better-designed checkout flow at a stadium means more concessions sold per inning. A clearer merchant dashboard means faster onboarding and lower support costs.

The Feb 2026 Stablecoin Settlement Platform introduces an entirely new design surface. You will be responsible for making 24/7 Global Liquidity understandable and actionable for merchants who may have no familiarity with stablecoin technology. This requires exceptional information design: presenting settlement status in real-time, showing liquidity flows that operate beyond traditional banking hours, building dashboards that let merchants compare traditional settlement timing with the new always-on stablecoin settlement, and designing the controls that let merchants choose their settlement preferences. The complexity of the underlying infrastructure must be invisible to the merchant — and that invisibility is the product designer's craft.

Shift4 is investing in design as a competitive differentiator, particularly as Skytab POS competes with Toast and Square for merchant adoption. Designers with payments domain experience are rare, and those who can also design for complex financial infrastructure like stablecoin settlement are rarer still. This scarcity gives you meaningful negotiation leverage.

### Stablecoin Settlement — The 24/7 Global Liquidity Premium

**Lever 1 — Settlement Experience Design:** "The Stablecoin Settlement Platform requires a product designer who can make 24/7 Global Liquidity intuitive for merchants with zero blockchain literacy. I'll be designing the settlement dashboard, the real-time liquidity visualization, and the merchant controls for a system that operates beyond traditional banking hours. This is foundational design work — not iteration on existing patterns — and it warrants a base salary of $160,000."

**Lever 2 — Merchant Trust Through Design:** "Stablecoin settlement is new territory for most merchants. The design of the settlement experience will directly determine merchant trust and adoption. If the dashboard clearly shows funds flowing 24/7 with transparent status updates, merchants adopt. If the design creates confusion, they stay with traditional settlement. I understand how to design for trust in financial interfaces, and this expertise should be reflected in my RSU grant at $100,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Cross-Platform Design System:** "Shift4 now operates Skytab POS, Appetize venue systems, and Vectron European POS — each with distinct design languages. Introducing Stablecoin Settlement across these platforms requires a cohesive design system that maintains the 24/7 Global Liquidity experience regardless of touchpoint. I will be building design infrastructure, not just screens. I'd like my total compensation to reflect this systems-level design work."

**Lever 4 — Stadium & Venue Experience Premium:** "Designing payment experiences for stadium environments — high-volume, time-pressured, often outdoors on mobile devices — is a specialized discipline. Layering Stablecoin Settlement merchant tools on top of the Appetize venue experience requires design that works under the unique constraints of live events. This venue-specific design expertise justifies a sign-on bonus of $15,000-$25,000."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $160,000 base (Center Valley) or $190,000 base (New York), with RSU ask of $100,000-$130,000/4yr. Product Designers should emphasize the foundational nature of the Stablecoin Settlement design work — you are defining the visual language and interaction patterns for a new product category, not iterating on existing flows. Your accept-at floor is $135,000 base + $70,000 RSU in Center Valley, or $160,000 base + $90,000 RSU in New York. If the base is firm, negotiate for a Senior Product Designer title, a $15,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus, and explicit design leadership scope over the 24/7 Global Liquidity merchant experience.
