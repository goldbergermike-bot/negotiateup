**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers a $3B+ revenue payments platform. You are responsible for the pipelines that ingest, transform, and serve billions of transaction records from the Skytab POS network, stadium and venue payment systems via Appetize, global acquiring transactions through Finaro, and European POS data from Vectron. This is high-volume, high-velocity, high-value data — every record represents real money moving through the system. Data quality failures don't just produce bad dashboards; they can cause incorrect merchant payouts, missed fraud signals, and regulatory reporting errors.

The Feb 2026 launch of the Stablecoin Settlement Platform creates an urgent need for data engineers who can build real-time settlement data pipelines. The 24/7 Global Liquidity platform operates beyond traditional banking hours, which means the data infrastructure must support continuous settlement event processing, real-time reconciliation, and always-on reporting. Unlike traditional batch-oriented payment data flows that reconcile overnight, stablecoin settlement data must flow in real-time — merchants need to see their settlement status continuously, the operations team needs live dashboards, and the compliance team needs real-time audit trails. This is a fundamental shift in data infrastructure architecture.

Data engineers with experience building real-time streaming pipelines at payments scale are in high demand across fintech. Shift4's additional requirement for stablecoin settlement data expertise narrows the talent pool further. The Feb 2026 launch deadline means the data infrastructure must be production-ready in advance of the settlement platform go-live — you cannot launch 24/7 settlement without 24/7 data pipelines. This gives you strong negotiation leverage.

### Stablecoin Settlement — The 24/7 Global Liquidity Premium

**Lever 1 — Real-Time Settlement Pipelines:** "The Stablecoin Settlement Platform requires real-time data pipelines that process settlement events 24/7 — not overnight batch jobs. I'll be building the streaming infrastructure that powers 24/7 Global Liquidity beyond traditional banking hours, including real-time reconciliation, merchant settlement status feeds, and compliance event streams. This real-time architecture expertise warrants a base salary of $185,000."

**Lever 2 — Cross-Platform Data Unification:** "Shift4's data currently flows through separate pipelines from Skytab, Appetize, Finaro, and Vectron. The Stablecoin Settlement Platform needs a unified data layer that brings these streams together for 24/7 Global Liquidity reporting and reconciliation. I will architect the data unification strategy that enables settlement across all acquired platforms. This data architecture scope justifies RSU grants of $130,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Settlement Reconciliation Engine:** "Stablecoin Settlement reconciliation — matching merchant transactions to settlement events to stablecoin transfers to final fund availability — must happen in real-time for 24/7 Global Liquidity. Building the data engine that reconciles these events with zero tolerance for discrepancy is core to the platform's trustworthiness. A reconciliation error means a merchant doesn't get paid correctly. This precision-critical data work warrants total comp of $340,000."

**Lever 4 — Regulatory Data Compliance:** "Operating 24/7 Global Liquidity through Stablecoin Settlement generates continuous compliance data that regulators expect in specific formats and timeframes. I will build the regulatory data pipelines that ensure Shift4 meets FinCEN, international AML, and state-level reporting requirements. Non-compliance has existential risk. This regulatory data expertise justifies a sign-on bonus of $20,000-$30,000."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $185,000 base (Center Valley) or $215,000 base (New York), with RSU ask of $130,000-$170,000/4yr. Data Engineers should emphasize the paradigm shift from batch to real-time that Stablecoin Settlement demands — you are not building incremental data pipelines, you are rebuilding the data infrastructure for 24/7 Global Liquidity. Your accept-at floor is $155,000 base + $90,000 RSU in Center Valley, or $180,000 base + $120,000 RSU in New York. Negotiate for a $20,000-$30,000 sign-on bonus and push for tooling budget commitments (streaming platform, data warehouse scaling) as a non-monetary lever that signals organizational investment in your success.
