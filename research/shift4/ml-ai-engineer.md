**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) build the intelligent systems that extract value from one of the payments industry's richest transaction datasets. With $3B+ in revenue flowing through systems that serve stadiums, venues, restaurants, and hospitality merchants worldwide, Shift4 generates billions of labeled transaction events that are ideal training data for fraud detection models, merchant risk scoring, dynamic pricing optimization, and demand forecasting. Your models run in the hot path of payment processing — a fraud detection model that adds 50ms of latency or produces 1% more false positives directly impacts merchant experience and revenue.

The Feb 2026 launch of the Stablecoin Settlement Platform creates ML/AI challenges that no other payments company is solving. You will build models for a 24/7 Global Liquidity environment that operates beyond traditional banking hours — including real-time settlement fraud detection (where traditional rule-based systems are insufficient for the speed and novelty of stablecoin settlement), liquidity demand prediction (forecasting how much stablecoin reserve Shift4 needs hour-by-hour across its settlement pool), anomaly detection for settlement patterns, and AI-powered merchant insights that help businesses understand their cash flow in an always-on settlement world. These are greenfield ML problems with novel training data.

The ML/AI talent market is the most competitive in technology. Shift4 competes against Google, Meta, OpenAI, and well-funded AI startups for engineers who can build production ML systems. The Stablecoin Settlement use case provides a compelling pitch — real-world, high-stakes ML problems with unique data — but compensation must be competitive. Your negotiation leverage is amplified by the fact that ML engineers with payments domain expertise are exceptionally rare, and those who can also work with stablecoin settlement data are essentially nonexistent.

### Stablecoin Settlement — The 24/7 Global Liquidity Premium

**Lever 1 — Settlement Fraud Detection Models:** "The Stablecoin Settlement Platform requires real-time ML-based fraud detection that operates 24/7 — beyond traditional banking hours where rule-based systems were designed for batch review. I will build models that detect fraudulent settlement patterns in a 24/7 Global Liquidity environment, where transaction velocity and pattern novelty render traditional approaches ineffective. This bleeding-edge ML work warrants a base salary of $210,000."

**Lever 2 — Liquidity Prediction Systems:** "Shift4 must maintain optimal stablecoin reserves for the settlement pool, and this requires ML models that predict liquidity demand across 24/7 Global Liquidity — by hour, by merchant segment, by geography. Over-reserving ties up capital; under-reserving causes settlement delays. My models will directly optimize Shift4's capital efficiency. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect this direct financial impact at $180,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Real-Time Inference at Payments Scale:** "ML models for Stablecoin Settlement must run inference in the critical path of 24/7 Global Liquidity flows — adding sub-10ms latency while processing thousands of settlement events per second. I have experience deploying ML models at this latency and throughput, which is essential for always-on settlement infrastructure. This real-time ML expertise justifies total comp of $425,000."

**Lever 4 — Novel Training Data Advantage:** "No other payments company has stablecoin settlement transaction data at scale. The models I build at Shift4 will be trained on data that literally does not exist elsewhere — 24/7 Global Liquidity patterns, cross-platform settlement behavior, venue-specific settlement flows. This creates a durable ML competitive advantage for Shift4. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $30,000-$45,000 that reflects my role in building this moat."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $210,000 base (Center Valley) or $245,000 base (New York), with RSU ask of $180,000-$240,000/4yr. ML/AI Engineers should benchmark against Big Tech ML compensation, not traditional payments company bands — Shift4 is competing for the same talent pool. Your accept-at floor is $175,000 base + $120,000 RSU in Center Valley, or $205,000 base + $160,000 RSU in New York. Push hard on RSU grants by connecting your model outputs to FOUR stock performance — fraud reduction and liquidity optimization directly impact margins and therefore market cap. Negotiate a $30,000-$45,000 sign-on bonus and a GPU/compute budget commitment for Stablecoin Settlement ML development as a non-monetary lever.
