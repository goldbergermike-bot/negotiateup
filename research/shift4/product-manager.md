**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) sit at the center of a complex product ecosystem spanning integrated payments, POS systems, venue commerce, and now stablecoin-based settlement infrastructure. With $3B+ in revenue and rapid expansion across hospitality, entertainment, and stadium verticals, Shift4's product organization must balance scaling existing products like Skytab POS with launching transformative new platforms. You will own product strategy for systems that directly generate revenue — every feature decision, pricing model, and roadmap choice has a measurable P&L impact.

The Feb 2026 launch of the Stablecoin Settlement Platform is the most significant product initiative in Shift4's history. As a Product Manager, you will define how merchants interact with 24/7 Global Liquidity — determining the settlement cadence options, the merchant dashboard experience, the pricing model for stablecoin settlement versus traditional bank settlement, and the go-to-market strategy for this capability beyond traditional banking hours. This requires product thinking that spans payments infrastructure, blockchain technology, merchant experience, and regulatory compliance across markets served by Finaro's global acquiring network.

Shift4 competes with Stripe, Toast, and Fiserv for product talent, and PMs with payments domain expertise are exceptionally difficult to hire. The Stablecoin Settlement launch creates a narrow window where Shift4 must staff its product team to define and ship the merchant-facing experience. Use this urgency to negotiate aggressively, particularly on RSU grants that will benefit from FOUR's growth as the stablecoin narrative materializes.

### Stablecoin Settlement — The 24/7 Global Liquidity Premium

**Lever 1 — Settlement Product Definition:** "The Stablecoin Settlement Platform requires a product manager who can define how merchants experience 24/7 Global Liquidity — from settlement timing options to pricing models to the dashboard experience. I will be creating an entirely new product category that operates beyond traditional banking hours. This product definition role is foundational and warrants a base salary of $190,000."

**Lever 2 — Merchant Experience Strategy:** "Shift4 serves stadiums, venues, and hospitality merchants through Skytab POS. Introducing Stablecoin Settlement to this merchant base requires careful product strategy — these merchants need to understand the value of 24/7 Global Liquidity without being overwhelmed by blockchain complexity. I have experience translating complex infrastructure capabilities into simple merchant experiences, which directly applies here. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect this at $160,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Global Product Expansion:** "With Finaro providing global acquiring and Vectron expanding European POS presence, the Stablecoin Settlement product must work across regulatory regimes and market expectations. I will be defining the product for 24/7 Global Liquidity across these geographies, which requires product sense that spans local market needs and global platform architecture. This cross-market product ownership justifies total comp of $390,000."

**Lever 4 — Competitive Differentiation Ownership:** "No other integrated payments company has launched a Stablecoin Settlement Platform. As the PM defining this product, I am creating Shift4's competitive moat in 24/7 Global Liquidity. This is the kind of product work that directly impacts NYSE: FOUR valuation. I'd like to discuss a sign-on bonus of $25,000-$35,000 that reflects the immediate strategic impact I'll have."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $190,000 base (Center Valley) or $220,000 base (New York), with RSU ask of $160,000-$200,000/4yr. Product Managers should emphasize the product-definition nature of the Stablecoin Settlement role — you are not optimizing an existing product, you are creating a new one. Your accept-at floor is $160,000 base + $120,000 RSU in Center Valley, or $185,000 base + $150,000 RSU in New York. Negotiate for a product leadership title upgrade (Senior PM) if comp is constrained, as this sets up future negotiation leverage. Push for a $25,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus framed as a "product definition premium" tied to the Feb 2026 Stablecoin Settlement launch.
