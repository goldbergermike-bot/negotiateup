**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) work with one of the richest transaction datasets in the payments industry. With $3B+ in revenue flowing through systems that serve stadiums, venues, restaurants, and hospitality merchants, you have access to billions of transaction records spanning consumer behavior at sporting events, dining patterns, entertainment spending, and cross-border commerce via Finaro's global acquiring network. This dataset is a competitive moat — and your ability to extract actionable intelligence from it directly drives merchant value, fraud reduction, and pricing optimization across the Skytab POS platform.

The Feb 2026 launch of the Stablecoin Settlement Platform introduces an entirely new data domain. You will be analyzing settlement patterns in a 24/7 Global Liquidity environment that operates beyond traditional banking hours — understanding how merchant settlement behavior changes when funds are available around the clock rather than on next-day or T+2 schedules. This includes modeling liquidity demand curves, detecting anomalous settlement patterns that may indicate fraud or compliance issues, and building predictive models that help Shift4 optimize its own liquidity reserves for the stablecoin settlement pool. The data science challenges here are novel — no other payments company has this dataset yet.

Shift4's investment in data science is accelerating as the company recognizes that analytical capabilities are a key differentiator in the competitive payments landscape. Data scientists with payments domain expertise and the ability to work with real-time streaming transaction data are highly sought after. Your negotiation leverage is amplified by the Stablecoin Settlement timeline — the data infrastructure and models need to be in place before the Feb 2026 launch.

### Stablecoin Settlement — The 24/7 Global Liquidity Premium

**Lever 1 — Settlement Pattern Analysis:** "The Stablecoin Settlement Platform will generate an entirely new data domain — settlement behavior in a 24/7 Global Liquidity environment. No other payments company has this dataset. I'll be building the foundational models that analyze how merchants use always-on settlement beyond traditional banking hours, which will directly inform product and pricing decisions. This first-mover analytical advantage warrants a base salary of $185,000."

**Lever 2 — Fraud & Compliance Modeling:** "24/7 Global Liquidity through Stablecoin Settlement creates new fraud vectors that don't exist in traditional banking-hours settlement. I will be building the detection models that protect Shift4 and its merchants from settlement fraud in an always-on environment. Fraud losses directly impact the bottom line, and my models will be a critical risk mitigation layer. I'd like my RSU grant to reflect this at $130,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Liquidity Optimization Intelligence:** "Shift4 must maintain optimal liquidity reserves for the Stablecoin Settlement pool, and the predictive models I build will determine how efficiently the company deploys capital for 24/7 Global Liquidity. A 10% improvement in liquidity prediction accuracy could save millions in reserve costs annually. This direct P&L impact justifies total comp positioning at $345,000."

**Lever 4 — Venue Transaction Intelligence:** "Shift4's stadium and venue transaction data through Appetize is uniquely rich — I can model consumer spending patterns at live events with precision no other company can match. Combining this with Stablecoin Settlement analytics creates a vertically integrated intelligence platform. This cross-domain analytical capability justifies a sign-on bonus of $20,000-$30,000."

Data Scientists should emphasize the novelty of the Stablecoin Settlement dataset — you will be building models on data no other payments company has access to, which makes your work uniquely valuable and your skills non-transferably specialized to Shift4's advantage. Your accept-at floor is $155,000 base + $90,000 RSU in Center Valley, or $180,000 base + $120,000 RSU in New York. Negotiate for a $20,000-$30,000 sign-on bonus and explicit access commitments to the settlement data pipeline, ensuring you have the analytical infrastructure to deliver on the 24/7 Global Liquidity modeling mandate.
