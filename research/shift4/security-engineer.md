**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Shift4 Payments (NYSE: FOUR) protect the infrastructure that processes billions of dollars in payment transactions. This is not abstract security work — a breach at Shift4 would impact tens of thousands of merchants across stadiums, venues, restaurants, and hospitality properties, exposing millions of consumer payment credentials. You operate at the intersection of PCI-DSS compliance, application security, infrastructure hardening, and real-time threat detection across the Skytab POS platform, Finaro's global acquiring network, Appetize venue systems, and Vectron's European POS deployments. The attack surface is vast, multi-geography, and constantly expanding through acquisitions and product launches.

The Feb 2026 launch of the Stablecoin Settlement Platform introduces an entirely new security domain. You will be responsible for securing 24/7 Global Liquidity infrastructure that operates beyond traditional banking hours — this means the threat landscape is also 24/7 with no quiet periods. Stablecoin settlement adds blockchain-adjacent security considerations: smart contract interaction security, wallet management, key custody, settlement finality verification, and cross-chain risk assessment. These are security challenges that most payments security engineers have never encountered, requiring a hybrid skillset that spans traditional payments security and blockchain security primitives.

Security engineers with payments-scale experience are already scarce. Security engineers who also understand stablecoin and blockchain security are extraordinarily rare. Shift4 is competing for this talent against crypto exchanges, DeFi protocols, and traditional fintech companies simultaneously. Your hybrid expertise commands a significant premium, and the Stablecoin Settlement launch timeline means the security infrastructure must be audited and production-ready before Feb 2026.

### Stablecoin Settlement — The 24/7 Global Liquidity Premium

**Lever 1 — Stablecoin Security Architecture:** "The Stablecoin Settlement Platform introduces blockchain-adjacent security challenges that don't exist in traditional payments: key custody, wallet management, settlement finality verification, and smart contract interaction security. Securing 24/7 Global Liquidity requires a security engineer with both payments PCI-DSS expertise and blockchain security knowledge. This hybrid skillset is rare and warrants a base salary of $200,000."

**Lever 2 — Always-On Threat Landscape:** "Traditional payment security operates with the assumption that transaction volume has peaks and valleys. The Stablecoin Settlement Platform creates 24/7 Global Liquidity beyond traditional banking hours, meaning the threat landscape is continuous — attackers can target settlement flows at any hour. I will design the security monitoring and incident response framework for this always-on environment. This elevated operational security posture justifies RSU grants of $150,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Regulatory Security Compliance:** "Stablecoin Settlement introduces regulatory requirements that go beyond PCI-DSS — including FinCEN guidance on stablecoin transmission, international cryptocurrency regulations across Finaro's markets, and state-level money transmitter requirements. I will be the security engineer ensuring Shift4's 24/7 Global Liquidity platform meets these evolving regulatory obligations. This regulatory security expertise warrants total comp of $380,000."

**Lever 4 — Breach Prevention ROI:** "A security incident on the Stablecoin Settlement Platform would be catastrophic — both operationally and reputationally. The cost of a single breach at Shift4's scale (merchant notifications, regulatory fines, lost revenue, stock impact on NYSE: FOUR) far exceeds the cost of premium security talent. Investing in my expertise to prevent breaches in the 24/7 Global Liquidity infrastructure is orders of magnitude cheaper than remediation. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $25,000-$35,000 as an immediate security investment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $200,000 base (Center Valley) or $235,000 base (New York), with RSU ask of $150,000-$190,000/4yr. Security Engineers should frame compensation as breach prevention investment — the cost of your salary is trivial compared to the financial and reputational cost of a Stablecoin Settlement security incident. Your accept-at floor is $170,000 base + $100,000 RSU in Center Valley, or $195,000 base + $130,000 RSU in New York. Push for a 15% security specialty premium above standard engineering comp bands, citing the hybrid payments + blockchain security requirement. Negotiate a $25,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus and request funding for security certifications (CISSP, CCSP, blockchain security credentials) as a non-monetary benefit.
