**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Navan occupy one of the most consequential roles in the organization. Navan processes corporate travel transactions, manages corporate credit cards, handles expense reimbursements, and stores sensitive employee and corporate data for 10,000+ companies — making it one of the highest-value targets in enterprise software. The Feb 2026 AI Rebooking launch introduced additional security surface area: autonomous rebooking decisions require secure API calls to airline systems, payment reprocessing demands PCI-compliant transaction flows, and Ava AI's access to traveler data must be governed by enterprise-specific access controls.

The Reliability Architect positioning has a direct security dimension: reliability includes security. An enterprise customer's trust in Navan depends not only on uptime but on the assurance that their corporate travel data, payment credentials, and employee information are protected to the highest standards. Security Engineers who can build and maintain this trust — through SOC 2 compliance, PCI DSS certification, data encryption architectures, and AI safety frameworks for Concierge 2.0 — are protecting Navan's ability to win and retain customers in the $1.5T corporate travel market.

At a $9.4B private valuation, Security Engineers who join pre-IPO are building the security infrastructure that will be scrutinized by public market investors, enterprise auditors, and regulatory bodies. The security posture Navan presents at IPO directly impacts investor confidence and enterprise customer acquisition. Candidates with fintech security experience, SOX compliance background, or AI safety expertise should position these as premium skills and negotiate accordingly.

### Concierge 2.0 — The Reliability Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Rebooking Security Architecture:** "The Feb 2026 AI Rebooking engine processes payment transactions autonomously, accesses airline APIs with stored credentials, and makes decisions with corporate policy data — every one of these operations requires security engineering. I build the authentication, authorization, and encryption frameworks that make autonomous rebooking safe for Concierge 2.0. This security-critical scope justifies a base salary of $230,000 and a top-of-band options grant."

**Lever 2 — Reliability Architect Trust Infrastructure:** "Navan's Reliability Architect positioning means that security IS reliability. When 10,000+ companies trust Navan with their corporate card data, travel itineraries, and employee information in a $1.5T market, they're trusting my security architecture. A breach doesn't just cost data — it destroys the trust that Navan's entire business model depends on. This existential-risk responsibility warrants $100,000/year in options and a $25,000 signing bonus."

**Lever 3 — Pre-IPO Compliance Infrastructure:** "IPO readiness requires SOX compliance, enhanced data governance, investor-grade security reporting, and regulatory audit preparation. I've built pre-IPO security infrastructure before and can accelerate Navan's compliance posture from startup to public-company standards. At $9.4B with a16z and Lightspeed backing, the equity opportunity is compelling — I'm requesting a total options package of $420,000 over four years with contractual refresh grants."

**Lever 4 — Ava AI Safety & Governance:** "Concierge 2.0 introduces AI safety challenges that most security teams haven't faced: ensuring Ava AI doesn't make unauthorized transactions, preventing prompt injection attacks that could manipulate rebooking decisions, and building audit trails for autonomous AI actions. I bring specific AI security expertise that protects both Navan and its enterprise customers. This specialized skill set warrants a $20,000 performance bonus and a defined path to Staff Security Engineer within 18 months."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $230,000 base (San Francisco) and frame yourself as the trust architect who makes Reliability Architect credible to enterprise customers. Request a total options package of $420,000 over four years, a $25,000 signing bonus, and scope that encompasses both application security and AI safety for Concierge 2.0. Emphasize that security incidents at a pre-IPO company can derail the entire IPO timeline. If base is constrained, negotiate for a security-specific on-call premium ($12,000/year) and a guaranteed 6-month review with a $15,000 base adjustment. Your accept-at floor should be $190,000 base + $70,000/year options + $20,000 signing bonus in SF, representing approximately $280,000 in first-year total compensation.
