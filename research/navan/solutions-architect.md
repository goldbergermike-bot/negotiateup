**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Navan are the technical bridge between the platform and its 10,000+ enterprise customers — they design integrations, architect deployment strategies, and translate the Concierge 2.0 vision into enterprise-specific implementations. The Feb 2026 AI Rebooking launch created new technical complexity for enterprise onboarding: customers now need their travel policies, approval workflows, and expense categorization rules integrated with Ava AI's rebooking engine, and Solutions Architects are the ones who make that integration seamless across the $1.5T corporate travel market.

The Reliability Architect positioning is essentially the Solutions Architect's sales thesis: every enterprise deal depends on a Solutions Architect convincing the customer's IT, finance, and travel management teams that Navan's platform is reliable enough to replace their existing SAP Concur or legacy travel management infrastructure. SAs who can build technical trust with enterprise stakeholders, design integration architectures that handle complex corporate hierarchies, and demonstrate Ava AI's capabilities in pilot deployments directly drive revenue growth. This makes the SA role one of the most revenue-influential technical positions at Navan.

Pre-IPO equity at a $9.4B valuation is compelling for Solutions Architects because their work directly drives the enterprise revenue growth that determines IPO readiness. SAs at Navan touch every major enterprise deal, and the relationships they build become strategic moats. Candidates should negotiate for variable compensation tied to deal outcomes, option grants that reflect their revenue influence, and scope that encompasses the most strategic enterprise accounts.

### Concierge 2.0 — The Reliability Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Rebooking Enterprise Integration:** "Every enterprise deployment of the Feb 2026 AI Rebooking engine requires custom integration work — mapping corporate travel policies to Ava AI's decision framework, configuring approval workflows for autonomous rebooking, and integrating expense reconciliation with the customer's ERP. I'm the technical architect who makes Concierge 2.0 work for each enterprise customer, and that direct revenue impact in a $1.5T market justifies a base salary of $230,000 and a variable comp structure tied to enterprise deployments."

**Lever 2 — Reliability Architect Sales Enablement:** "When enterprise prospects evaluate Navan against SAP Concur, I'm the person who builds technical credibility. My architecture designs, integration proofs-of-concept, and reliability demonstrations directly influence win rates for deals worth $500K-$5M annually. As the Reliability Architect in the sales process, my compensation should include a $50,000 variable component tied to enterprise deal outcomes, on top of a $220,000 base."

**Lever 3 — Pre-IPO Enterprise Revenue Influence:** "Solutions Architects at pre-IPO companies have disproportionate impact on revenue growth — every enterprise integration I design becomes a reference architecture that accelerates future deployments across Navan's 10,000+ customer base. At a $9.4B valuation, the equity should reflect this revenue multiplier effect: I'm targeting $95,000/year in options with a total package of $380,000 over four years, plus guaranteed refresh grants."

**Lever 4 — Ava AI Enterprise Customization:** "Concierge 2.0's enterprise value depends on customization — each company has unique travel policies, expense workflows, and compliance requirements. I architect the integration layer that makes Ava AI work within each enterprise's constraints while maintaining the platform's reliability promise. This enterprise intelligence is rare and directly drives expansion revenue. I'm requesting a $25,000 signing bonus and a defined path to Principal SA within 18-24 months."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $230,000 base (San Francisco) with a $50,000 variable component tied to enterprise deal outcomes, positioning yourself as the revenue-driving technical architect. Request a total options package of $380,000 over four years, a $25,000 signing bonus, and scope ownership of Navan's top-tier enterprise accounts. Emphasize that your integration architectures become templates that scale across the entire customer base. If base is constrained, push for an uncapped variable structure with a $45,000-$55,000 target tied to quarterly deployment milestones. Your accept-at floor should be $190,000 base + $35,000 variable + $65,000/year options + $20,000 signing bonus in SF, representing approximately $310,000 in first-year total compensation.
