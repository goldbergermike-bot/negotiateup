### Engineering Manager | Anyscale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Significant Growth-Stage Equity | Ray Distributed Computing Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Scaling Distributed Systems Engineering Org

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $218K–$272K | $215K–$385K | 10–15% | $300K–$448K |
| New York | $213K–$267K | $215K–$385K | 10–15% | $295K–$440K |
| London | £166K–£207K | £161K–£289K | 10–15% | £228K–£340K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Anyscale lead the teams building the managed Ray platform — managing 6-12 engineers across distributed scheduler development, GPU cluster management, Ray Serve (model serving), Ray Data (distributed data processing), or enterprise platform features. Anyscale's EM role is deeply technical: you must understand distributed systems, GPU architecture, and cloud infrastructure well enough to make architectural trade-offs, participate in design reviews for the Ray framework, and evaluate the technical risk of platform changes that affect millions of Ray users.

At a growth-stage company like Anyscale, EMs are building the engineering organization that will scale Ray from a popular open-source project to the enterprise standard for distributed AI. You're hiring distributed systems engineers in the most competitive talent market in tech, establishing engineering processes that balance open-source contribution with commercial product velocity, and building team structures for multiple product surfaces.

### Scaling Distributed Systems Engineering Org Lever
Anyscale's 2026 growth plan requires scaling the engineering organization to support Ray framework development, enterprise platform features, multi-cloud infrastructure, and emerging use cases (LLM training, agent orchestration, batch inference). EMs must hire engineers with deep distributed systems expertise — the rarest and most expensive engineering profile in the market — while building teams that can ship both open-source framework improvements and enterprise features.

The open-source dimension adds organizational complexity: EMs must balance community contribution expectations (Ray is used by millions) with enterprise product delivery timelines. EMs who have managed engineering teams at companies that bridge open-source and commercial products (Red Hat, MongoDB, Databricks, Elastic) bring directly applicable leadership experience.

**Global Levers**
1. **Distributed Systems Org-Building:** "I've built engineering organizations focused on distributed systems at [company] — hiring the rarest engineering talent and shipping infrastructure at scale. That org-building experience commands $268K base and $370K equity/4yr."
2. **Open-Source + Enterprise EM Expertise:** "I've led teams balancing open-source framework contributions with commercial product delivery. That dual-mode leadership is exactly what Anyscale needs. I need $270K base."
3. **Competing EM Offers:** "Google is offering L6 EM at $265K / $435K RSU and Databricks EM at $262K / $405K RSU — both liquid. I need $268K base and $378K equity to choose Anyscale."
4. **Distributed Systems Talent Network:** "I can bring a network of exceptional distributed systems engineers. That hiring multiplier justifies $272K base and a $40K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Leading the engineering organization that builds the world's most important distributed AI platform is the most compelling EM role in infrastructure. I'm holding a Google L6 EM offer at $265K / $435K RSU and a Databricks EM offer at $262K / $405K RSU. To choose Anyscale, I need $268K base, $375K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $40K signing bonus. At $268K, I commit to building the engineering org for Ray's enterprise era. My floor is $248K — below that, Google's liquid equity wins."
