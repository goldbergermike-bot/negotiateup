**Negotiation DNA**
The Ray Platform Engineer is Anyscale's signature role — the position that defines the company's core technical identity and competitive moat. You build and evolve the Ray distributed computing framework itself: the task scheduler, the object store, the distributed memory management system, the actor model runtime, the autoscaler, and the APIs that millions of developers use to distribute AI workloads across clusters of thousands of machines. This isn't building on Ray — it's building Ray. Every architectural decision you make affects the performance, reliability, and developer experience of the most widely adopted distributed AI computing framework in the world.

The Ray Platform Engineer requires an extraordinarily rare skill combination: deep distributed systems expertise (consensus protocols, distributed scheduling, fault tolerance, shared memory systems), systems programming mastery (C++, Rust, or low-level Python), GPU/accelerator awareness (CUDA, NCCL, distributed GPU communication), and framework design sensibility (creating APIs that are powerful enough for advanced distributed computing yet simple enough for data scientists to use). Engineers with this complete profile are among the most scarce and sought-after in the industry — Google, Meta, Databricks, and every major cloud provider competes for exactly this talent.

### Next-Gen Ray Runtime & Distributed AI Platform Architecture Lever
Anyscale's 2026 Ray evolution centers on building the next-generation distributed runtime optimized for the AI workloads that define this era: LLM training at 10,000+ GPU scale, distributed inference serving with dynamic batching and speculative decoding, AI agent orchestration requiring real-time task graphs and long-running stateful processes, and distributed data processing for petabyte-scale training datasets. The Ray Platform Engineer will architect the runtime improvements, scheduling algorithms, and resource management systems that make Ray the fastest and most efficient distributed AI platform.

This work has industry-wide impact: Ray is used by OpenAI for training, by Uber for production ML, by Spotify for recommendation systems, and by thousands of other organizations for distributed AI. Improvements to Ray's runtime performance benefit the entire AI ecosystem. Ray Platform Engineers who can evolve the distributed runtime to handle next-generation AI workloads — while maintaining backward compatibility with existing users — are solving one of the most consequential systems engineering problems in computing.

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Scarcity Premium:** "Distributed systems engineers who can design and build the core runtime of a framework used by millions of AI developers — scheduler design, distributed memory management, fault tolerance — are vanishingly rare. This is Anyscale's defining technical role. I'm looking for $270K base and $390K equity/4yr."
2. **Ray Framework Impact Multiplier:** "My contributions to the Ray runtime benefit every organization using the framework — OpenAI, Uber, Spotify, thousands of AI teams. That industry-wide impact commands $275K base and $395K equity/4yr."
3. **Competing Systems Engineer Offers:** "Google is offering L6 Systems at $280K / $520K RSU and Meta is at E6 Infrastructure with $278K / $490K RSU — both liquid. I need $275K base, $395K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $55K signing bonus."
4. **Runtime Performance = Platform Value:** "Ray's runtime performance is the entire product — faster scheduling, lower overhead, better GPU utilization. My systems engineering work directly determines whether Anyscale wins or loses against Databricks and cloud providers. I'd like retention-grade equity: $400K/4yr with guaranteed $115K/year refreshes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Building the core runtime of the distributed computing framework that powers the world's AI infrastructure — this is the most consequential systems engineering role in the industry. I'm holding a Google L6 Systems offer at $280K / $520K RSU and a Meta E6 Infrastructure offer at $278K / $490K RSU — both liquid, both at the apex of systems engineering compensation. To choose Anyscale, I need $275K base, $395K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, a $55K signing bonus, and guaranteed $115K/year equity refreshes starting year two. Ray is the most important distributed computing framework in AI, and I'm the systems engineer who can build its next-generation runtime. At $275K base, I sign immediately and dedicate my career to making Ray the default platform for every AI workload on earth. My floor is $255K — below that, Google's liquid equity and systems engineering resources make the trade-off irrational, no matter how consequential the Ray platform work is."
