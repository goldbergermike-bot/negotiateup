**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Anyscale drive the strategy for the managed Ray platform — defining which infrastructure features to build, how to position against Databricks and cloud provider alternatives, and how to monetize the platform for enterprise customers who need distributed AI compute at scale. PMs here must be deeply technical: you're working with distributed systems engineers, ML infrastructure experts, and enterprise customers to build a platform that simplifies the most complex computing workloads in the industry.

Anyscale competes for PMs against Databricks, AWS, Google Cloud, and the AI infrastructure startup ecosystem. PMs with distributed systems or ML infrastructure practitioner backgrounds are particularly valuable — if you've managed distributed training jobs or built ML infrastructure before becoming a PM, that hands-on experience is strong leverage.

**Level Mapping:** Anyscale PM = Google L5 PM (Cloud) = AWS PM = Databricks PM = Meta PM IC5

### Enterprise AI Infrastructure Product Strategy Lever
Anyscale's 2026 product strategy centers on making Ray the enterprise standard for distributed AI — from LLM training through model serving, batch inference, and AI agent orchestration. PMs will define the platform features that differentiate Anyscale from DIY Ray deployments and cloud provider alternatives: intelligent auto-scaling, cost optimization, enterprise security, workload management, and the unified platform experience that makes distributed AI accessible to enterprises.

The competitive positioning challenge is strategic: Anyscale must articulate why enterprises should use the managed Ray platform rather than Databricks, SageMaker, or self-managed Ray on Kubernetes. PMs who can define this positioning, build the differentiated features, and drive enterprise adoption are making decisions that determine Anyscale's market trajectory.

**Global Levers**
1. **Infrastructure PM Domain Expertise:** "I've been an infrastructure practitioner and a PM — I understand distributed computing from both sides. That dual expertise commands $228K base and $265K equity/4yr."
2. **Enterprise AI Platform Strategy:** "I've defined product strategy for enterprise AI infrastructure at [company]. PMs who can position distributed computing platforms against cloud providers command $230K base."
3. **Competing PM Offers:** "Databricks is offering PM at $232K / $310K RSU and AWS is at $225K / $280K RSU. I need $228K base and $270K equity to choose Anyscale."
4. **Platform Positioning Impact:** "My product decisions will define how Anyscale positions against Databricks and cloud providers. That strategic leverage justifies $230K base and a $30K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Defining the product strategy for the managed Ray platform — the most important distributed AI computing framework in the industry — is the most strategically consequential infrastructure PM role in the market. I'm holding a Databricks PM offer at $232K / $310K RSU and an AWS PM offer at $225K / $280K RSU. To choose Anyscale, I need $228K base, $268K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $228K, I commit to defining Anyscale's enterprise platform strategy. My floor is $213K — below that, Databricks' liquid equity wins."
