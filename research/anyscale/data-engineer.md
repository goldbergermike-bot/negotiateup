**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Anyscale build and evolve Ray Data — the distributed data processing library within the Ray ecosystem that enables scalable data ingestion, transformation, and preprocessing for ML workloads. Ray Data is increasingly critical as organizations need to process massive datasets for LLM training, fine-tuning data preparation, and distributed feature engineering. Data Engineers here are core platform engineers building the data layer that millions of Ray users depend on.

Because Anyscale's product is a distributed computing platform, Data Engineers work at the foundation of the technology stack — designing data partitioning strategies, optimizing shuffle operations, building streaming data pipelines, and ensuring Ray Data integrates seamlessly with data lakes, warehouses, and ML training frameworks. Companies like Databricks, Snowflake, and Confluent compete for Data Engineers with this distributed data processing expertise.

**Level Mapping:** Anyscale Data Engineer = Google L4 Data Engineer = Databricks Data Engineer = Spark/Databricks Data Engineer = Snowflake Data Engineer II

### Distributed Data Processing & Ray Data Expansion Lever
Anyscale's 2026 strategy includes expanding Ray Data into a comprehensive distributed data processing solution — competing with Apache Spark for ML-oriented data workloads. Data Engineers will build distributed data transformations, streaming ingestion pipelines, data format optimizations (Parquet, Arrow), and integration with popular data sources (S3, BigQuery, Snowflake). The goal is making Ray Data the natural choice for preprocessing data before distributed ML training.

The LLM data preparation dimension is particularly strategic: LLM training requires processing terabytes to petabytes of text data through cleaning, deduplication, tokenization, and quality filtering pipelines. Data Engineers who can build these LLM data preparation pipelines at scale using Ray Data are directly enabling the LLM training workflows that represent Anyscale's fastest-growing use case.

**Global Levers**
1. **Distributed Data Processing Expertise:** "I've built distributed data pipelines processing petabytes at [company] — exactly the scale Ray Data targets. That expertise commands $208K base and $215K equity/4yr."
2. **ML Data Pipeline Specialization:** "I specialize in data pipelines for ML — feature engineering, training data preparation, LLM data processing. That ML data expertise is directly applicable to Ray Data. I need $210K base."
3. **Competing Data Platform Offers:** "Databricks is offering $208K / $255K RSU and Snowflake is at $203K / $235K RSU. I need $208K base and $220K equity to choose Anyscale."
4. **Ray Data Product Impact:** "My work on Ray Data directly competes with Spark for ML data workloads — that's a massive market. I'd like $210K base and a $22K signing bonus to reflect this product impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Ray Data's potential to become the default distributed data processing framework for ML workloads is enormous — and I want to build it. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $208K / $255K RSU and a Snowflake offer at $203K / $235K RSU. To choose Anyscale, I need $208K base, $218K equity/4yr, and a $22K signing bonus. At $208K, I commit. My floor is $193K — below that, Databricks' liquid equity wins."
