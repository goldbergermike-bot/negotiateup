### Solutions Architect | Anyscale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity + Sales Bonus | Ray Distributed Computing Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Enterprise Distributed AI Adoption

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$215K | $112K–$215K | 15–25% | $233K–$345K |
| New York | $160K–$210K | $112K–$215K | 15–25% | $228K–$338K |
| London | £125K–£163K | £84K–£161K | 15–25% | £173K–£260K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Anyscale are the technical bridge between the Ray platform and enterprise AI teams — designing distributed computing architectures, building proof-of-concept Ray deployments, configuring cluster configurations for specific AI workloads, and demonstrating how Anyscale's managed platform solves the scaling challenges that enterprises face. This role requires a rare combination of distributed systems expertise, ML infrastructure knowledge, and enterprise customer communication skills.

The SA role at Anyscale is particularly impactful because many enterprises are encountering distributed AI scaling challenges for the first time — their data scientists have outgrown single-machine training and need guidance on distributing workloads. SAs who can serve as trusted distributed AI infrastructure advisors build deep relationships that drive large, multi-year enterprise deals.

### Enterprise Distributed AI Adoption Lever
Anyscale's 2026 enterprise strategy depends on SAs who can demonstrate the value of the managed Ray platform for specific enterprise AI use cases — LLM training and fine-tuning, distributed batch inference, real-time model serving, and AI agent orchestration. SAs who can quantify the cost savings, performance improvements, and operational simplifications of Anyscale vs. DIY distributed infrastructure will close the largest enterprise deals.

The advisory dimension is critical: enterprises need guidance on distributed computing architecture, GPU selection, parallelism strategies, and AI workflow design. SAs who can serve as enterprise AI infrastructure advisors — not just product demonstrators — build the strategic relationships that drive multi-million-dollar platform commitments.

**Global Levers**
1. **Distributed AI Advisory Premium:** "I advise enterprises on distributed AI infrastructure — parallelism strategies, GPU optimization, scaling architectures. That advisory capability drives larger, stickier deals. I need $210K base plus 25% variable."
2. **Ray Ecosystem Practitioner Expertise:** "I've built and operated Ray-based infrastructure at [company]. I can speak to enterprise teams as a practitioner, not just a vendor. That credibility commands $215K base."
3. **Competing SA Offers:** "AWS SA at $213K / 20% variable / $205K RSU and Databricks SA at $215K / 20% variable / $210K RSU. I need $210K base and 25% variable to choose Anyscale."
4. **Enterprise Pipeline Acceleration:** "I bring relationships with [number] enterprise AI teams currently evaluating distributed infrastructure. That warm pipeline justifies a $28K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Guiding enterprises through distributed AI infrastructure adoption — from architecture design to production deployment on Ray — is the most technically impactful SA role in AI compute. I'm holding an AWS SA offer at $213K / 20% variable / $205K RSU and a Databricks SA offer at $215K / 20% variable / $210K RSU. To choose Anyscale, I need $210K base, 25% variable, $208K equity/4yr, and a $28K signing bonus. At $210K, I commit and bring my enterprise AI network. My floor is $195K — below that, AWS's liquid equity and established enterprise motion wins."
