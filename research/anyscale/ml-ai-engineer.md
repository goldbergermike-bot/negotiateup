### ML/AI Engineer | Anyscale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Base + Growth-Stage Equity + AI Premium | Ray Distributed Computing Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Distributed ML Training & Serving Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $195K–$255K | $175K–$315K | 5–15% | $270K–$400K |
| New York | $190K–$250K | $175K–$315K | 5–15% | $265K–$393K |
| London | £148K–£194K | £131K–£236K | 5–15% | £206K–£305K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Anyscale build the ML-specific capabilities of the Ray platform — Ray Train (distributed ML training), Ray Tune (hyperparameter optimization), Ray Serve (model serving), and the ML workflow integrations that make Ray the preferred framework for scaling AI. You work at the intersection of distributed systems and machine learning, building the infrastructure that enables ML teams to train larger models, tune more efficiently, and serve models at scale.

This is one of the most technically demanding ML engineering roles in the industry: you must understand both distributed systems (task scheduling, data parallelism, fault tolerance) and ML training dynamics (gradient synchronization, learning rate schedules, convergence behavior) deeply enough to build infrastructure that makes distributed ML fast and reliable. Engineers with this dual expertise are in extreme demand from Google, Databricks, OpenAI, and every company scaling AI workloads.

### Distributed ML Training & Serving Intelligence Lever
Anyscale's 2026 ML strategy centers on making Ray the most efficient and easiest-to-use framework for distributed LLM training, fine-tuning, and serving. ML/AI Engineers will build intelligent training orchestration (automatically configuring data parallelism, tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism for different model architectures), efficient serving infrastructure (dynamic batching, speculative decoding, KV cache optimization), and automated evaluation pipelines for distributed model training.

The LLM training infrastructure market is exploding: organizations are spending billions on GPU compute for LLM training, and any improvement in training efficiency directly saves significant money. ML/AI Engineers who can make Ray Train 10-20% more efficient for LLM workloads are creating enormous value — both for Anyscale's platform and for every organization using it.

**Global Levers**
1. **Distributed ML Infrastructure Premium:** "Engineers who deeply understand both distributed systems and ML training are extraordinarily rare. I've built distributed training infrastructure at [company]. That dual expertise commands $250K base and $300K equity/4yr."
2. **LLM Training Optimization Expertise:** "I've optimized LLM training infrastructure — parallelism strategies, GPU utilization, gradient synchronization. That LLM expertise is directly applicable to Ray Train. I need $255K base."
3. **Competing AI Infrastructure Offers:** "OpenAI is offering $248K / $360K equity and Databricks ML Infra is at $245K / $340K RSU. I need $250K base and $310K equity to choose Anyscale."
4. **Training Efficiency = Customer Value:** "Every 10% improvement in Ray Train efficiency saves Anyscale's customers millions in compute costs. My ML infrastructure work directly drives customer retention and expansion. I'd like $255K base and a $35K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Building the distributed ML training and serving infrastructure for the Ray platform — the framework that powers AI at OpenAI, Uber, and thousands of organizations — is the highest-leverage ML infrastructure role in the industry. I'm holding an OpenAI offer at $248K / $360K equity and a Databricks ML Infra offer at $245K / $340K RSU. To choose Anyscale, I need $250K base, $305K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $250K, I sign. My floor is $232K — below that, the AI lab offers win financially."
