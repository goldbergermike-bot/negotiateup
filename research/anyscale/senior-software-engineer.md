**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Anyscale own critical subsystems of the managed Ray platform — distributed task scheduling, auto-scaling infrastructure, GPU cluster management, multi-tenant resource isolation, or the Ray Serve model serving layer. At this level, Anyscale expects engineers who can independently architect distributed systems at scale, make production reliability decisions, and contribute to the open-source Ray framework while building commercial platform features.

Anyscale's unique position bridging open-source Ray and enterprise cloud infrastructure means Senior SWEs must be fluent in both worlds: contributing to the open-source framework that thousands of organizations depend on, while building the managed platform features that enterprise customers pay for. This dual responsibility — open-source stewardship plus commercial product engineering — is a rare and valuable skill combination.

### Enterprise-Grade Ray Platform & LLM Infrastructure Lever
Anyscale's 2026 enterprise push requires making the managed Ray platform enterprise-ready: multi-tenant isolation, enterprise access controls, compliance certifications, cost management dashboards, and SLA-backed reliability for production AI workloads. Senior Engineers will architect these enterprise features while maintaining Ray's performance advantage — the speed and simplicity that made Ray the preferred framework for scaling AI.

The LLM infrastructure opportunity is particularly critical: organizations are using Ray to distribute LLM training, run fine-tuning jobs, and serve models at scale. Senior Engineers who can optimize the Ray platform for LLM workloads — efficient GPU utilization, distributed training coordination, model serving auto-scaling — are building the infrastructure for the most important AI workloads in the industry.

**Global Levers**
1. **Distributed Systems Architecture Premium:** "I've architected distributed systems at the scale Ray operates — millions of tasks, thousands of nodes, sub-millisecond scheduling. That architecture experience commands $252K base and $330K equity/4yr."
2. **LLM Infrastructure Expertise:** "I have experience building infrastructure for LLM training and serving at [company]. As Ray becomes the standard for LLM workloads, this expertise is essential. I need $255K base."
3. **Competing Senior Offers:** "Databricks is offering Senior SWE at $255K / $365K RSU and Google is at L5 with $248K / $355K RSU — both liquid. I need $252K base and $340K equity to choose Anyscale."
4. **Open-Source + Enterprise Dual Impact:** "My work will improve both the open-source Ray framework and the commercial platform. That dual-impact leverage justifies $258K base and a $35K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Anyscale is building the definitive platform for distributed AI — and Ray's position as the default scaling framework makes this the most impactful infrastructure role in the market. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $255K / $365K RSU and a Google L5 offer at $248K / $355K RSU. To choose Anyscale, I need $252K base, $335K equity/4yr with 30% year-one vesting, and a $35K signing bonus. At $252K base, I sign and build enterprise Ray. My floor is $235K — below that, Databricks' liquid equity is the rational choice."
