### Security Engineer | Anyscale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity | Ray Distributed Computing Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Distributed AI Workload Security & Enterprise Compliance

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $180K–$232K | $142K–$255K | 5–10% | $235K–$330K |
| New York | $175K–$227K | $142K–$255K | 5–10% | $230K–$323K |
| London | £137K–£176K | £107K–£191K | 5–10% | £178K–£250K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Anyscale protect enterprise AI workloads running on the managed Ray platform — distributed training jobs processing proprietary data on hundreds of GPUs, model serving endpoints handling sensitive inference requests, and the multi-tenant platform infrastructure that isolates customer workloads from each other. A security breach at Anyscale could expose proprietary training data, model weights, and confidential business logic for some of the world's most valuable AI organizations.

The distributed computing security challenge is unique: Ray clusters span hundreds of nodes with inter-worker communication, shared object stores, and dynamic task scheduling — creating a complex attack surface that differs significantly from traditional web application security. Security Engineers who understand distributed systems security, container orchestration security, and GPU infrastructure protection are in extreme demand.

### Distributed AI Workload Security & Enterprise Compliance Lever
Anyscale's 2026 security mandate includes building enterprise-grade workload isolation (ensuring one customer's training job cannot access another's data or compute), secure Ray cluster communication (encrypting inter-worker traffic in distributed jobs), GPU memory security (preventing data leakage between GPU workloads), and comprehensive compliance certifications (SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, FedRAMP) for regulated AI workloads.

The AI security dimension is emerging: enterprises running LLM training and inference through Anyscale need assurance that training data isn't leaked, model weights are protected, and inference results aren't accessible to unauthorized parties. Security Engineers who can build security frameworks for distributed AI workloads — a nascent field — are pioneering new security practices for the AI infrastructure industry.

**Global Levers**
1. **Distributed Systems Security Premium:** "Securing distributed computing platforms — multi-node clusters, inter-worker communication, shared memory stores — is a specialized field. I bring this expertise from [company]. That commands $228K base and $248K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Workload Security Specialization:** "Securing AI training data, model weights, and inference pipelines in distributed environments is a nascent field. I'm one of few security engineers with this expertise. I need $230K base."
3. **Competing Security Offers:** "AWS is offering Security Engineer at $225K / $265K RSU and Databricks is at $222K / $250K RSU. I need $228K base and $250K equity to choose Anyscale."
4. **Enterprise Compliance Acceleration:** "I've led SOC 2 and FedRAMP compliance programs for cloud platforms. Accelerating Anyscale's compliance enables government and healthcare AI enterprise deals. I'd like a $30K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Securing distributed AI workloads on the Ray platform — multi-tenant GPU isolation, encrypted distributed computation, enterprise compliance — is the most technically novel security engineering role in AI infrastructure. I'm holding an AWS offer at $225K / $265K RSU and a Databricks offer at $222K / $250K RSU. To choose Anyscale, I need $228K base, $248K equity/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $228K, I commit to building the enterprise security program. My floor is $213K — below that, AWS's liquid equity wins."
