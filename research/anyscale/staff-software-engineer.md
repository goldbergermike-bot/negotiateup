### Staff Software Engineer | Anyscale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Top-Tier Base + Significant Growth-Stage Equity | Ray Distributed Computing Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: Next-Gen Distributed AI Platform Architecture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $240K–$305K | $310K–$510K | 10–15% | $370K–$555K |
| New York | $235K–$300K | $310K–$510K | 10–15% | $365K–$548K |
| London | £182K–£232K | £233K–£383K | 10–15% | £281K–£422K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Staff Software Engineers at Anyscale set the architectural direction for the entire Ray platform — designing the distributed scheduling systems, resource management layers, fault tolerance mechanisms, and cloud infrastructure abstractions that make Ray the preferred framework for scaling AI workloads at companies like OpenAI, Uber, and Spotify. At this level, you are the technical authority for multi-year architectural decisions that affect millions of Ray users and thousands of Anyscale enterprise customers.

Staff Engineers at Anyscale are extraordinarily scarce: the role requires deep distributed systems mastery, GPU infrastructure knowledge, cloud-native architecture expertise, and the judgment to evolve an open-source framework while building a commercial platform. Google, Databricks, and the major cloud providers all compete for this profile, typically with liquid equity and higher guaranteed compensation. Anyscale must offer compelling terms to attract this caliber of talent.

### Next-Gen Distributed AI Platform Architecture Lever
Anyscale's 2026 platform evolution centers on making Ray the universal runtime for AI workloads — from training and fine-tuning to serving, evaluation, and agent orchestration. Staff Engineers will architect the platform abstractions that unify these diverse workload types under a single scheduling and resource management framework, while maintaining the performance and simplicity that made Ray successful.

The architectural challenge is profound: LLM workloads demand GPU-aware scheduling, massive data parallelism, and efficient communication between distributed workers. AI agent workloads require dynamic task graphs, long-running process management, and real-time responsiveness. Staff Engineers who can design abstractions that serve both workload families — without compromising either — are solving one of the hardest problems in distributed systems.

**Global Levers**
1. **Distributed Systems Architecture Leadership:** "I'll be defining the architecture of the distributed computing platform that powers the world's AI infrastructure. That's the highest-impact distributed systems role in the industry. I need $300K base and $495K equity/4yr."
2. **Competing Staff Offers:** "Google is offering L6 at $288K / $530K RSU and Databricks Staff at $282K / $480K RSU — both liquid. I need $300K base, $500K equity/4yr, and a $55K signing bonus."
3. **Ray Framework Stewardship:** "As a Staff Engineer, I'll influence the direction of both open-source Ray and the commercial platform — impacting millions of developers and thousands of enterprise customers. That dual leverage justifies $305K base."
4. **Retention-Grade Equity:** "For a Staff hire, I need guaranteed refresh grants — $135K/year starting year two — ensuring my total comp stays competitive through Anyscale's growth phase."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Anyscale is building the distributed computing platform that powers the AI revolution — and Ray's trajectory as the universal AI runtime makes this the most consequential platform architecture role in infrastructure. I'm holding a Google L6 offer at $288K / $530K RSU and a Databricks Staff offer at $282K / $480K RSU. To choose Anyscale, I need $300K base, $500K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, a $55K signing bonus, and $135K/year guaranteed refreshes. At $300K, I commit and architect Ray's next era. My floor is $275K — below that, Google's liquid equity and distributed systems scale is the rational choice."
