### Software Engineer | Anyscale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Growth-Stage Equity | Ray Distributed Computing Platform Leader | 2026 Focus: AI Infrastructure Scaling & Ray Platform Expansion

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $170K–$218K | $135K–$245K | 5–10% | $220K–$310K |
| New York | $165K–$213K | $135K–$245K | 5–10% | $215K–$303K |
| London | £129K–£166K | £101K–£184K | 5–10% | £167K–£235K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Anyscale build the managed Ray platform that powers distributed AI workloads for some of the world's largest AI teams — including OpenAI, Uber, Spotify, and Instacart. Ray is the open-source distributed computing framework that has become the de facto standard for scaling ML training, serving, and data processing, and Anyscale commercializes Ray as a managed cloud platform. Engineers here work at the intersection of distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and AI workloads — a technically demanding combination that few engineers possess.

Anyscale competes for engineering talent against Databricks, Snowflake, Google Cloud, and the major AI labs. The Ray ecosystem gives Anyscale unique positioning: engineers who understand distributed computing, Kubernetes, and ML infrastructure are in extraordinary demand as every organization scales AI workloads. Your distributed systems experience is direct negotiation leverage.

### AI Infrastructure Scaling & Ray Platform Expansion Lever
Anyscale's 2026 strategy centers on making Ray the default platform for scaling any AI workload — from LLM training and fine-tuning to distributed inference serving and AI agent orchestration. Software Engineers who can build cloud-native infrastructure features on top of Ray — auto-scaling, resource management, multi-tenant isolation, cost optimization — are critical to Anyscale's enterprise platform growth.

The LLM infrastructure wave creates a massive tailwind: organizations that were running modest ML training jobs are now scaling to massive LLM training and serving workloads. Anyscale's Ray platform is uniquely positioned to capture this demand, and engineers who can build the managed platform features that make LLM infrastructure accessible to enterprise teams are worth a significant premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Distributed Systems Expertise:** "I have deep experience with distributed computing frameworks and cluster management at [company]. Anyscale's Ray platform needs this exact expertise. I'm looking for $213K base and $235K equity/4yr."
2. **Cloud Infrastructure Premium:** "Engineers who understand both distributed systems and cloud-native infrastructure (Kubernetes, auto-scaling, multi-tenant isolation) are rare. I bring this combination. I need $215K base."
3. **Competing AI Infrastructure Offers:** "Databricks is offering $210K / $265K RSU and AWS is at $208K / $240K RSU for distributed systems roles. I need $213K base and $240K equity to choose Anyscale."
4. **Ray Ecosystem Familiarity:** "I'm an active Ray user and contributor — I understand the framework deeply from the practitioner side. That domain expertise accelerates my productivity from day one. I'd like a $25K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Anyscale is building the managed platform for the most important distributed computing framework in AI — and I want to build it. I'm holding a Databricks offer at $210K / $265K RSU and an AWS offer at $208K / $240K RSU, both liquid. To choose Anyscale, I need $213K base, $238K equity/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $213K base, I commit. My floor is $198K — below that, Databricks' liquid equity wins."
