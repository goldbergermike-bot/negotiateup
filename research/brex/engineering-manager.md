### Engineering Manager | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | AI-Native Accounting API | Zero-Day Close Platform | $12B+ Valuation | **MAXIMIZE PRE-IPO OPTIONS BEFORE LISTING**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $212K–$268K | $202K–$355K | 15–20% | $288K–$408K |
| New York | $218K–$275K | $202K–$355K | 15–20% | $295K–$418K |
| Remote US | $205K–$260K | $202K–$355K | 15–20% | $280K–$400K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Brex Engineering Managers lead the teams that build the AI-first corporate card and spend management platform — owning engineering execution, team growth, and technical delivery across the platform that thousands of companies depend on. At the M1-M2 level, you drive the hiring, mentoring, and velocity of engineering teams shipping everything from core financial infrastructure to the AI-Native Accounting API that achieves Zero-Day Close. EMs at Brex have dual leverage: they are both people leaders who scale engineering capacity and technical contributors who shape the architecture of AI-powered financial products. Pre-IPO options are the highest-leverage comp lever — EMs should negotiate aggressively given their multiplier effect on team output. [Source: Brex EM Comp 2025-2026]

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As an Engineering Manager at Brex, you are an architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. You lead the engineering teams that build and scale this transformative capability, making hiring decisions, setting technical direction, and ensuring delivery velocity for the most strategically important product Brex has ever launched. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform, and engineering managers are the force multipliers who determine whether the Zero-Day Close vision becomes reality at enterprise scale. "As an Engineering Manager, I lead the teams building Zero-Day Close. The AI-Native Accounting API is Brex's most critical product bet — my team's execution velocity directly determines whether we capture the $50B+ AI accounting TAM before Ramp or legacy vendors can respond. I hire, mentor, and retain the engineers who make Zero-Day Close possible."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — as an EM, I have a multiplier effect on engineering output. I want 30% more options than the standard offer because my leadership directly accelerates team velocity and the AI product roadmap that drives valuation growth. This pre-IPO window has asymmetric upside."
2. **Zero-Day Close Team Leadership:** "I lead the engineering teams building Zero-Day Close — the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process. My hiring decisions, technical direction, and delivery management determine whether Brex ships this capability at the speed needed to capture the AI accounting market."
3. **Ramp/Stripe EM Competition:** "Ramp EMs earn $395K+ TC with competitive equity. Stripe EMs earn $420K+ TC with near-liquid RSUs. Brex must offer substantially more pre-IPO options to attract engineering leadership from competitors — my expected TC must reflect the multiplier impact I have on team output and platform delivery."
4. **AI-First Team Building:** "I build and lead the AI-native engineering teams that give Brex its competitive edge. Engineering managers at this stage define the engineering culture and hiring bar — I attract the talent that builds the Zero-Day Close moat competitors cannot replicate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $262K base and 30% more options than the standard equity offer for this Engineering Manager role at Brex pre-IPO. I lead the teams building the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close — my leadership multiplies engineering output and directly accelerates the product velocity that sustains the $12B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Ramp EM at $395K TC / Stripe EM at $420K TC / Navan EM at $385K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside for EMs whose multiplier effect drives team delivery." Accept at $238K+ base and 20%+ more options than standard.
