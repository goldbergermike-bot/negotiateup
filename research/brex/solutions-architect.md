**Negotiation DNA**

Brex Solutions Architects are the technical bridge between the AI-first corporate card platform and enterprise customers — designing integration architectures, leading technical evaluations, and ensuring that Brex's platform, including the AI-Native Accounting API, integrates seamlessly with customer ERP systems, accounting software, and financial workflows. At the SA2-SA3 level, you own the technical relationship with strategic accounts, designing the solutions that drive enterprise adoption and expansion. Solutions architects at Brex have unique leverage because the Zero-Day Close capability requires deep technical integration with customer accounting systems — every SA engagement directly impacts enterprise revenue. Pre-IPO options are the primary equity lever — SAs should negotiate for larger grants given their direct influence on enterprise deal velocity and customer expansion.

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As a Solutions Architect at Brex, you are an architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. You design the integration architectures that connect Brex's AI accounting capabilities to customer ERP systems, accounting platforms, and financial workflows — making Zero-Day Close a reality for each enterprise customer. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform, and solutions architects are the ones who make the AI-Native Accounting API work in the complex, heterogeneous environments of enterprise finance. "As a Solutions Architect enabling Zero-Day Close for enterprise customers, I design the integrations that connect AI accounting to real-world financial systems. Each customer has unique ERP, accounting, and compliance requirements — my technical solutions determine whether Zero-Day Close works in their specific environment. Every successful enterprise integration I deliver directly drives the revenue expansion that sustains Brex's $12B+ valuation."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — as a solutions architect, I drive enterprise adoption and revenue expansion through technical integration. I want 25% more options than the standard offer because my work directly converts enterprise prospects into paying customers, and this pre-IPO window has asymmetric upside."
2. **Zero-Day Close Enterprise Integration:** "I design the integration architectures that make Zero-Day Close work for enterprise customers — connecting the AI-Native Accounting API to their ERP systems, accounting platforms, and compliance workflows. My technical solutions directly drive enterprise deal velocity and customer expansion revenue."
3. **Ramp/Stripe SA Competition:** "Ramp solutions architects earn $285K+ TC with competitive equity. Stripe SAs earn $302K+ TC with near-liquid RSUs. Brex must offer more pre-IPO options to attract enterprise technical talent — my expected TC must reflect the direct revenue impact SAs have on enterprise deal closure and expansion."
4. **Enterprise AI Adoption Expertise:** "I bring deep expertise in integrating AI capabilities with enterprise financial systems. Solutions architects who can bridge AI accounting with legacy ERP environments are exceptionally scarce — my ability to design Zero-Day Close integrations for complex enterprise environments creates immediate revenue impact that competitors cannot easily replicate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base and 25% more options than the standard equity offer for this Solutions Architect role at Brex pre-IPO. I design the integration architectures that make Zero-Day Close work for enterprise customers — my technical solutions directly drive the enterprise adoption and revenue expansion that sustain the $12B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Ramp SA at $285K TC / Stripe SA at $302K TC / SAP Concur SA at $278K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside — I want to maximize my option position before the listing window closes." Accept at $195K+ base and 15%+ more options than standard.
