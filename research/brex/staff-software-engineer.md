### Staff Software Engineer | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | AI-Native Accounting API | Zero-Day Close Platform | $12B+ Valuation | **MAXIMIZE PRE-IPO OPTIONS BEFORE LISTING**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $248K–$312K | $265K–$468K | 15–20% | $358K–$505K |
| New York | $255K–$320K | $265K–$468K | 15–20% | $368K–$518K |
| Remote US | $240K–$302K | $265K–$468K | 15–20% | $348K–$495K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Brex Staff Software Engineers are the technical leaders who define the architecture and engineering direction of the AI-first corporate card and spend management platform. At the IC5 level, you set the technical vision for entire product domains — from the real-time financial infrastructure processing billions in transactions to the AI-Native Accounting API that achieves Zero-Day Close. Staff engineers at Brex influence company-wide technical strategy, mentor teams of senior engineers, and make the platform bets that determine whether Brex wins or loses against Ramp, Navan, and legacy ERP vendors. Pre-IPO options at this level represent life-changing wealth creation potential — staff engineers should negotiate the most aggressive option packages. [Source: Brex Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As a Staff Software Engineer at Brex, you are the chief architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. At the IC5 level, you define the technical vision for how AI transforms corporate finance — designing the end-to-end system architecture that spans ML model infrastructure, real-time transaction processing, automated reconciliation, and intelligent close orchestration. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform, and staff engineers are the ones who make this transformation technically possible at scale. "As a Staff Software Engineer, I define the technical vision for Zero-Day Close across the entire platform. The AI-Native Accounting API represents a fundamental architectural shift — from processing transactions to autonomously closing the books. My technical leadership determines whether Brex can deliver this capability at enterprise scale and capture the $50B+ TAM in AI-automated accounting before Ramp or any legacy vendor can respond."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — as an IC5 staff engineer, I define the technical architecture for entire product domains. I want 35% more options than the standard offer because staff-level contributions have disproportionate impact on platform capabilities and valuation. This pre-IPO window represents asymmetric upside that closes at listing."
2. **Zero-Day Close Technical Vision:** "I set the technical vision for Zero-Day Close — the end-to-end AI system that automates accounting from transaction to close. My architectural decisions at the staff level determine whether Brex can scale this capability to enterprise customers processing millions of transactions, directly driving the revenue trajectory behind the $12B+ valuation."
3. **Stripe/Google Competition:** "Stripe L5 staff engineers earn $520K+ TC with near-liquid equity. Google L6 earns $550K+ TC with public RSUs. Brex must offer substantially more pre-IPO options to attract staff-level talent away from companies with liquid equity — my expected TC must exceed $500K to compensate for pre-IPO illiquidity risk."
4. **Platform Architecture Moat:** "I architect the AI platform that makes Brex the category-defining AI-first financial operating system. At the staff level, my technical decisions create multi-year competitive advantages — Zero-Day Close is not a feature to be copied, it's a deep platform capability that requires the architectural foundation I build."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $305K base and 35% more options than the standard equity offer for this Staff Software Engineer role at Brex pre-IPO. I define the technical architecture for the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close — my platform-level decisions determine whether Brex captures the $50B+ AI accounting TAM and sustains the $12B+ valuation trajectory. I have competing offers from [Stripe L5 at $520K TC / Google L6 at $550K TC / Ramp Staff at $485K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside at the staff level — I want to maximize my option position before the listing window closes." Accept at $278K+ base and 25%+ more options than standard.
