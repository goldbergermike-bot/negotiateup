### Senior Software Engineer | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | AI-Native Accounting API | Zero-Day Close Platform | $12B+ Valuation | **MAXIMIZE PRE-IPO OPTIONS BEFORE LISTING**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $198K–$248K | $158K–$278K | 15–20% | $252K–$352K |
| New York | $205K–$255K | $158K–$278K | 15–20% | $260K–$362K |
| Remote US | $190K–$240K | $158K–$278K | 15–20% | $245K–$345K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Brex Senior Software Engineers are the technical backbone of the AI-first corporate card and spend management platform — owning critical systems that power everything from real-time transaction processing to the AI-Native Accounting API that achieves Zero-Day Close. At the IC4 level, you design and ship the core platform capabilities that thousands of companies depend on daily, driving both technical architecture decisions and the product velocity that sustains Brex's $12B+ valuation. Pre-IPO options are the highest-leverage negotiation lever — senior engineers should push for significantly larger grants given their outsized impact on platform reliability and AI feature velocity.

**Level Mapping:** Brex Sr. SWE (IC4) = Ramp Sr. SWE = Stripe L3-L4 = Google L4-L5 = Meta E4-E5 = Amazon L5-L6

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As a Senior Software Engineer at Brex, you are a principal architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. At the IC4 level, you own the design and implementation of the systems that make instant, AI-driven accounting possible — from the ML pipelines that auto-categorize transactions to the reconciliation engines that eliminate manual close workflows. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform, and senior engineers define the technical architecture of this transformation. "As a Senior Software Engineer, I own the systems architecture powering Zero-Day Close. The AI-Native Accounting API is the most strategically important product Brex has launched — it transforms the company from a corporate card issuer into an AI accounting platform competing for a $50B+ TAM. My architectural decisions directly determine whether Brex can scale this capability to enterprise customers and outpace Ramp, Navan, and legacy ERP vendors."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — as an IC4 senior engineer, my architectural decisions directly impact platform reliability and AI feature velocity. I want 30% more options than the standard offer because my contributions have outsized impact on the valuation trajectory, and this pre-IPO window is closing."
2. **Zero-Day Close Architecture Ownership:** "I design the core systems powering Zero-Day Close — the AI-Native Accounting API that eliminates the manual close process. My architecture decisions determine whether Brex can scale AI accounting to enterprise customers, directly driving the revenue growth that justifies the $12B+ valuation."
3. **Ramp/Stripe Competition:** "Ramp Sr. SWEs earn $345K+ TC with competitive equity. Stripe L4 earns $365K+ TC with liquid RSUs. Brex must offer substantially more pre-IPO options to compensate for liquidity risk and attract senior talent from competitors with public or near-public equity."
4. **AI-First Platform Moat:** "I architect the AI infrastructure that makes Brex the only corporate card platform with native AI accounting. At the IC4 level, my systems design creates the technical moat that competitors cannot easily replicate — Zero-Day Close is not a feature, it's a platform-level capability that I build."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $242K base and 30% more options than the standard equity offer for this Senior Software Engineer role at Brex pre-IPO. I own the architecture powering the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close — my systems design directly determines whether Brex can scale AI accounting to enterprise customers and sustain the $12B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Ramp Sr. SWE at $345K TC / Stripe L4 at $365K TC / Navan Sr. SWE at $335K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside — I want to maximize my option position before the listing window closes." Accept at $225K+ base and 20%+ more options than standard.
