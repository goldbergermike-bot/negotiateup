### Technical Program Manager | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | AI-Native Accounting API | Zero-Day Close Platform | $12B+ Valuation | **MAXIMIZE PRE-IPO OPTIONS BEFORE LISTING**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$208K | $108K–$192K | 10–15% | $195K–$268K |
| New York | $172K–$215K | $108K–$192K | 10–15% | $202K–$275K |
| Remote US | $160K–$202K | $108K–$192K | 10–15% | $190K–$262K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Brex Technical Program Managers orchestrate the cross-functional execution that ships the AI-first corporate card and spend management platform — coordinating across engineering, product, design, data science, and operations to deliver complex programs on time and at scale. At the TPM2-TPM3 level, you own the program delivery for initiatives spanning multiple engineering teams, managing dependencies, mitigating risks, and ensuring that strategic bets like the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close ship with the quality and velocity that Brex's competitive position demands. TPMs at Brex have outsized impact because the platform's complexity — real-time financial processing, AI workloads, compliance requirements, and enterprise integrations — requires exceptional cross-team coordination. Pre-IPO options are the primary equity lever — TPMs should negotiate for larger grants given their multiplier effect on program delivery velocity. [Source: Brex TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As a Technical Program Manager at Brex, you are an architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. You orchestrate the cross-functional execution that makes Zero-Day Close a reality — coordinating ML engineering, platform infrastructure, product, design, compliance, and enterprise integration teams to ship the most complex program Brex has ever undertaken. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform, and TPMs are the ones who ensure that all the technical and organizational pieces come together to deliver Zero-Day Close at enterprise scale. "As a TPM orchestrating Zero-Day Close delivery, I coordinate across ML engineering, platform, product, compliance, and enterprise teams to ship the AI-Native Accounting API. This is the most cross-functionally complex program Brex has ever undertaken — my program management directly determines whether Zero-Day Close launches on time, at quality, and at the scale needed to capture the $50B+ AI accounting TAM."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — as a TPM, I have a multiplier effect on cross-functional delivery velocity. I want 20% more options than the standard offer because my program management directly accelerates the strategic initiatives that drive valuation growth, and this pre-IPO window has asymmetric upside."
2. **Zero-Day Close Program Delivery:** "I orchestrate the delivery of Zero-Day Close — coordinating across ML engineering, platform, product, compliance, and enterprise integration teams. My program management determines whether the AI-Native Accounting API ships on time and at quality, directly impacting the market capture that drives revenue growth."
3. **Ramp/Stripe TPM Competition:** "Ramp TPMs earn $262K+ TC with competitive equity. Stripe TPMs earn $278K+ TC with near-liquid RSUs. Brex must offer more pre-IPO options to attract program management talent — my expected TC must reflect the multiplier impact TPMs have on cross-functional delivery velocity."
4. **Fintech Program Complexity:** "I manage programs at the intersection of AI, financial processing, and enterprise compliance — the most complex program environment in fintech. TPMs who can navigate ML engineering dependencies, financial regulatory requirements, and enterprise integration timelines are exceptionally scarce, making my program expertise an immediate strategic asset."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $205K base and 20% more options than the standard equity offer for this Technical Program Manager role at Brex pre-IPO. I orchestrate the cross-functional delivery of the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close — my program management directly determines whether Brex's most strategic initiative ships on time and at quality to capture the $50B+ AI accounting TAM and sustain the $12B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Ramp TPM at $262K TC / Stripe TPM at $278K TC / Navan TPM at $255K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside — I want to maximize my option position before the listing window closes." Accept at $188K+ base and 15%+ more options than standard.
