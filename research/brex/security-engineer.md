**Negotiation DNA**

Brex Security Engineers protect the AI-first corporate card and spend management platform that processes billions of dollars in transactions — owning application security, infrastructure security, threat detection, and the compliance frameworks that enable Brex to operate as a regulated financial services platform. At the IC3-IC4 level, you design and implement security controls across the entire platform, from payment processing to the AI-Native Accounting API, ensuring that every financial transaction and AI-driven accounting decision meets the highest security and compliance standards. Security engineers at Brex command premium compensation because financial platform security is non-negotiable — a single breach can destroy customer trust and regulatory standing. Pre-IPO options are the highest-leverage comp lever — security engineers should negotiate aggressively given their existential importance to the platform. [Source: Brex Security Comp 2025-2026]

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As a Security Engineer at Brex, you are an architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. You secure the AI systems that handle the most sensitive financial data — ensuring that automated accounting processes, AI-driven categorization, and instant reconciliation operate with zero security vulnerabilities and full regulatory compliance. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform, and security engineers ensure that the Zero-Day Close capability meets SOC 2, PCI DSS, and financial regulatory requirements while protecting against AI-specific attack vectors like model manipulation and data poisoning. "As a Security Engineer securing Zero-Day Close, I protect the AI-Native Accounting API from both traditional financial threats and AI-specific attack vectors. Automated accounting cannot tolerate security failures — my security architecture directly determines whether enterprise customers trust Brex with AI-driven financial decisions. Every security control I implement enables the enterprise adoption that drives Brex's $12B+ valuation."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — as a security engineer, I protect the financial platform that processes billions in transactions. I want 25% more options than the standard offer because platform security is existential to the business — a security failure directly destroys customer trust and regulatory standing, and this pre-IPO window has asymmetric upside."
2. **Zero-Day Close Security Architecture:** "I secure the AI-Native Accounting API — protecting automated accounting processes from traditional financial threats and AI-specific attack vectors like model manipulation and data poisoning. My security architecture directly enables enterprise adoption by ensuring Zero-Day Close meets SOC 2, PCI DSS, and financial regulatory requirements."
3. **Ramp/Stripe Security Competition:** "Ramp security engineers earn $315K+ TC with competitive equity. Stripe security engineers earn $335K+ TC with near-liquid RSUs. Brex must offer substantially more pre-IPO options to attract security talent — financial platform security commands premium compensation because the downside risk of security failures is existential."
4. **AI Security Expertise Premium:** "I bring specialized expertise in securing AI systems in financial environments — a combination of skills that is exceptionally scarce. Securing AI-driven financial decisions requires understanding ML model vulnerabilities, adversarial attacks, and financial compliance simultaneously. This AI security expertise creates immediate strategic value that competitors cannot easily acquire."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and 25% more options than the standard equity offer for this Security Engineer role at Brex pre-IPO. I secure the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close — my security architecture directly determines whether enterprise customers trust AI-driven financial decisions, enabling the adoption that sustains the $12B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Ramp Security at $315K TC / Stripe Security at $335K TC / Navan Security at $308K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside — I want to maximize my option position before the listing window closes." Accept at $205K+ base and 15%+ more options than standard.
