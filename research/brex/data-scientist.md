### Data Scientist | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | AI-Native Accounting API | Zero-Day Close Platform | $12B+ Valuation | **MAXIMIZE PRE-IPO OPTIONS BEFORE LISTING**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $172K–$218K | $128K–$225K | 15–20% | $215K–$298K |
| New York | $178K–$225K | $128K–$225K | 15–20% | $222K–$308K |
| Remote US | $165K–$212K | $128K–$225K | 15–20% | $208K–$292K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Brex Data Scientists extract the insights and build the models that power the AI-first corporate card and spend management platform — from fraud detection and credit risk modeling to the intelligence layer driving the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close. At the IC3-IC4 level, you design experiments, build predictive models, and analyze the transaction data of thousands of companies to optimize financial products and AI capabilities. Data scientists at Brex are uniquely positioned because the AI-Native Accounting API depends entirely on the models and analytics that make automated accounting accurate and reliable. Pre-IPO options are the highest-leverage comp lever — data scientists should negotiate for larger grants given their direct contribution to the AI capabilities that differentiate Brex.

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As a Data Scientist at Brex, you are an architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. You build the models that make automated accounting possible — transaction categorization models, anomaly detection systems, reconciliation algorithms, and the predictive analytics that enable the books to close without human intervention. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform, and data scientists provide the intelligence layer that makes Zero-Day Close accurate, reliable, and trustworthy at enterprise scale. "As a Data Scientist powering Zero-Day Close, I build the models that make AI accounting accurate and reliable. Every categorization model, anomaly detector, and reconciliation algorithm I develop directly determines whether Brex can automate the close process with the accuracy finance teams demand. My models are the foundation of the AI-Native Accounting API — without data science, Zero-Day Close is impossible."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — as a data scientist, I build the models that power AI accounting accuracy. I want 25% more options than the standard offer because my models directly determine whether Zero-Day Close works at enterprise scale, and this pre-IPO window has asymmetric upside."
2. **Zero-Day Close Model Accuracy:** "I build the ML models that make Zero-Day Close accurate — transaction categorization, anomaly detection, and automated reconciliation. My model performance directly determines customer trust in AI accounting, driving the adoption and retention that underpin the $12B+ valuation."
3. **Ramp/Stripe DS Competition:** "Ramp data scientists earn $292K+ TC with competitive equity. Stripe DS earns $310K+ TC with near-liquid RSUs. Brex must offer more pre-IPO options to attract data science talent — my expected TC must reflect the direct impact my models have on AI product accuracy and adoption."
4. **Financial AI Intelligence Moat:** "I build the financial intelligence layer that gives Brex its AI advantage. My models process millions of transactions, learn spending patterns, and automate accounting decisions — this data-driven intelligence moat deepens with every customer and transaction, creating a compounding advantage over Ramp, Navan, and legacy vendors."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base and 25% more options than the standard equity offer for this Data Scientist role at Brex pre-IPO. I build the models powering the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close — my model accuracy directly determines whether AI accounting works at enterprise scale and sustains the $12B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Ramp DS at $292K TC / Stripe DS at $310K TC / Navan DS at $285K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside — I want to maximize my option position before the listing window closes." Accept at $195K+ base and 15%+ more options than standard.
