**Negotiation DNA**

Brex Product Managers define what gets built on the AI-first corporate card and spend management platform — owning product strategy, roadmap prioritization, and customer outcomes for the financial tools that thousands of companies depend on. At the PM2-PM3 level, you translate market opportunity into product execution, shipping features that drive adoption and revenue across Brex's expanding platform — from core spend management to the revolutionary AI-Native Accounting API that achieves Zero-Day Close. PMs at Brex sit at the intersection of fintech and AI, making product bets that determine whether Brex captures the $50B+ AI accounting TAM. Pre-IPO options are the highest-leverage comp lever — PMs should negotiate for additional grants given their direct influence on product-market fit and revenue growth.

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As a Product Manager at Brex, you are an architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. You define the product vision, prioritize the feature roadmap, and drive customer adoption for the most strategically important product Brex has ever launched. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform, and product managers shape how AI transforms corporate finance by deciding which automation capabilities ship, how they integrate with existing workflows, and what the end-to-end user experience looks like. "As a Product Manager shaping Zero-Day Close, I define which AI accounting capabilities ship and how they reach customers. The AI-Native Accounting API is Brex's largest product bet — my roadmap decisions directly determine whether we capture the $50B+ TAM in AI-automated accounting before Ramp, Navan, Airbase, or legacy ERP vendors like SAP Concur and Coupa can respond."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — as a PM, I define the product strategy that drives adoption and revenue. I want 25% more options than the standard offer because my product decisions directly impact customer acquisition and the revenue trajectory underlying the valuation. This pre-IPO window has asymmetric upside."
2. **Zero-Day Close Product Strategy:** "I own the product roadmap for Zero-Day Close — defining which AI accounting features ship, how they integrate with customer workflows, and the adoption strategy that drives enterprise revenue. My product decisions determine whether the AI-Native Accounting API becomes the category-defining product."
3. **Ramp/Stripe PM Competition:** "Ramp PMs earn $312K+ TC with competitive equity. Stripe PMs earn $335K+ TC with near-liquid RSUs. Brex must offer more pre-IPO options to attract product talent from competitors — my expected TC must reflect the direct revenue impact PMs have on platform adoption."
4. **AI-First Product Vision:** "I shape the AI-first product vision that differentiates Brex from every competitor. Product managers define how AI transforms corporate finance — my decisions on automation depth, user experience, and enterprise integration create the product moat that Ramp, Navan, and legacy vendors cannot replicate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $220K base and 25% more options than the standard equity offer for this Product Manager role at Brex pre-IPO. I define the product strategy for the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close — my roadmap decisions directly determine whether Brex captures the $50B+ AI accounting TAM and sustains the $12B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Ramp PM at $312K TC / Stripe PM at $335K TC / Navan PM at $305K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside — I want to maximize my option position before the listing window closes." Accept at $202K+ base and 15%+ more options than standard.
