**Negotiation DNA**

Brex Product Designers craft the user experiences that make the AI-first corporate card and spend management platform intuitive and delightful for finance teams across thousands of companies. At the D2-D3 level, you design the interfaces, workflows, and interaction patterns that transform complex financial operations — expense management, approvals, reconciliation, and AI-powered accounting — into seamless experiences. Designers at Brex have unique leverage because the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close require entirely new UX paradigms for AI-human collaboration in finance. Pre-IPO options are the primary equity lever — designers should negotiate for larger grants given their critical role in making AI capabilities accessible and adoptable.

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As a Product Designer at Brex, you are an architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. You design the experiences that make AI-powered accounting accessible, trustworthy, and adoptable by finance teams who have spent decades doing manual reconciliation. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform, and designers are the ones who make the AI capabilities feel natural — designing the dashboards, automation flows, and AI transparency patterns that give finance teams confidence in Zero-Day Close. "As a Product Designer shaping Zero-Day Close, I design the experiences that make AI accounting trustworthy and adoptable. The biggest barrier to AI adoption in finance is trust — my designs determine whether finance teams embrace Zero-Day Close or resist it. Every interaction pattern I create directly impacts adoption rates, customer retention, and the revenue growth that drives Brex's $12B+ valuation."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — as a designer, I shape the user experience that drives adoption and retention. I want 20% more options than the standard offer because my design decisions directly impact whether customers adopt AI accounting features, and this pre-IPO window has asymmetric upside."
2. **Zero-Day Close UX Innovation:** "I design the entirely new UX paradigms for Zero-Day Close — making AI-powered accounting transparent, trustworthy, and adoptable. My interaction patterns for AI-human collaboration in finance are the key to customer adoption, directly driving the enterprise revenue that sustains the $12B+ valuation."
3. **Ramp/Stripe Design Competition:** "Ramp designers earn $225K+ TC with competitive equity. Stripe designers earn $240K+ TC with near-liquid RSUs. Brex must offer more pre-IPO options to attract design talent — my expected TC must reflect the direct adoption impact designers have on AI product success."
4. **AI Trust & Adoption Design:** "I design the trust layer that makes Brex's AI accounting adoptable. In fintech, design quality directly determines whether customers trust AI with their finances. My work on transparency, explainability, and confidence patterns creates the adoption moat that competitors cannot replicate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $175K base and 20% more options than the standard equity offer for this Product Designer role at Brex pre-IPO. I design the experiences that make Zero-Day Close trustworthy and adoptable — my UX decisions directly determine whether finance teams embrace AI accounting, driving the adoption and retention that sustain the $12B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Ramp Designer at $225K TC / Stripe Designer at $240K TC / Navan Designer at $218K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside — I want to maximize my option position before the listing window closes." Accept at $162K+ base and 15%+ more options than standard.
