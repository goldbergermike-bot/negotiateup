### Software Engineer | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | AI-Native Accounting API | Zero-Day Close Platform | $12B+ Valuation | **MAXIMIZE PRE-IPO OPTIONS BEFORE LISTING**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $162K–$205K | $108K–$192K | 10–15% | $192K–$268K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Brex Software Engineers build the AI-first corporate card and spend management platform that is transforming how companies manage finances — from expense tracking to the revolutionary AI-Native Accounting API that achieves Zero-Day Close, eliminating the manual accounting close process entirely. Your code powers the platform serving thousands of high-growth companies, and every feature you ship accelerates Brex's trajectory from fintech disruptor to AI-powered financial operating system. At $12B+ valuation and pre-IPO, equity options are the highest-leverage comp component — candidates should negotiate aggressively for additional option grants before a public listing locks in the price.

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As a Software Engineer at Brex, you are an architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform where every engineer contributes to eliminating manual reconciliation, categorization, and close workflows through intelligent automation. Your work on the platform directly powers the AI systems that process millions of transactions, auto-categorize spend, and close the books instantly. "As a Software Engineer joining Brex post-AI-Native Accounting API launch, I'm building the infrastructure that makes Zero-Day Close possible for every Brex customer. This is the most important product bet Brex has made — automating the accounting close is a $50B+ TAM opportunity that positions Brex against SAP Concur, Coupa, and legacy ERP systems. My contributions directly expand the AI-first moat that competitors like Ramp and Navan cannot replicate."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — options granted now have asymmetric upside. I want 25% more options than the standard offer because this window closes at listing. Every additional option captures the full post-IPO appreciation as the AI-Native Accounting API drives enterprise adoption."
2. **Zero-Day Close Platform Impact:** "I build the platform powering Zero-Day Close — the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process. My code eliminates days of manual work for every Brex customer, directly driving the enterprise revenue growth that underpins the $12B+ valuation."
3. **Ramp/Stripe Competition:** "Ramp SWEs earn $265K+ TC with competitive equity. Stripe L3 earns $280K+ TC. Brex must offer additional pre-IPO options to compensate for liquidity risk and attract engineers away from competitors with more liquid equity."
4. **AI-First Fintech Moat:** "I build the AI infrastructure that makes Brex the only corporate card platform with native AI accounting. This Zero-Day Close capability is the competitive moat that separates Brex from Ramp, Navan, and legacy spend management — and justifies aggressive pre-IPO compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $198K base and 25% more options than the standard equity offer for this Software Engineer role at Brex pre-IPO. I build the platform powering the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close — my code directly drives the enterprise adoption underpinning the $12B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Ramp SWE at $265K TC / Stripe L3 at $280K TC / Navan SWE at $258K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside — I want to maximize my option position before the listing window closes." Accept at $182K+ base and 15%+ more options than standard.
