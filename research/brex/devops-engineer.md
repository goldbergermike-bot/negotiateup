**Negotiation DNA**

Brex DevOps Engineers build and maintain the infrastructure that powers the AI-first corporate card and spend management platform — owning CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, observability, and the deployment systems that ensure 99.99% uptime for a financial platform processing billions of dollars in transactions. At the IC2-IC3 level, you design the infrastructure automation, container orchestration, and reliability engineering that enables Brex's engineering teams to ship AI features rapidly while maintaining the compliance and security standards demanded by financial services. DevOps engineers at Brex are critical because the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close require infrastructure that can scale AI workloads alongside real-time financial processing. Pre-IPO options are the primary equity lever — DevOps engineers should negotiate for larger grants given their direct impact on platform reliability and deployment velocity.

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As a DevOps Engineer at Brex, you are an architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. You build the infrastructure that makes Zero-Day Close reliable at scale — the deployment pipelines, monitoring systems, and cloud architecture that ensure AI accounting processes run with financial-grade reliability. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform, and DevOps engineers ensure that the AI-Native Accounting API operates with the uptime, latency, and compliance guarantees that enterprise finance teams require. "As a DevOps Engineer building the infrastructure for Zero-Day Close, I ensure the AI-Native Accounting API runs with financial-grade reliability. AI accounting cannot tolerate downtime or data inconsistency — my infrastructure decisions directly determine whether Brex can guarantee the reliability that enterprise customers demand. Every deployment pipeline, monitoring alert, and scaling policy I build underpins the trust that makes Zero-Day Close possible."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — as a DevOps engineer, I build the infrastructure reliability that underpins every transaction and AI process. I want 20% more options than the standard offer because platform uptime directly impacts customer trust and revenue, and this pre-IPO window has asymmetric upside."
2. **Zero-Day Close Infrastructure Reliability:** "I build the infrastructure that makes Zero-Day Close reliable — deployment pipelines, monitoring, and scaling systems for AI accounting workloads. My infrastructure ensures 99.99% uptime for the AI-Native Accounting API, directly enabling the enterprise adoption that drives revenue growth."
3. **Ramp/Stripe DevOps Competition:** "Ramp DevOps engineers earn $242K+ TC with competitive equity. Stripe SREs earn $258K+ TC with near-liquid RSUs. Brex must offer more pre-IPO options to attract infrastructure talent — my expected TC must reflect the direct reliability impact DevOps has on platform trust."
4. **Financial-Grade Infrastructure Moat:** "I build the financial-grade infrastructure that enables Brex to run AI workloads alongside real-time transaction processing. This dual capability — AI accounting with financial compliance — requires specialized infrastructure that competitors like Ramp and Navan have not built, creating a reliability moat."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $192K base and 20% more options than the standard equity offer for this DevOps Engineer role at Brex pre-IPO. I build the infrastructure that ensures the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close operate with financial-grade reliability — my infrastructure decisions directly determine whether enterprise customers trust AI accounting at scale, driving the adoption that sustains the $12B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Ramp DevOps at $242K TC / Stripe SRE at $258K TC / Navan DevOps at $235K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside — I want to maximize my option position before the listing window closes." Accept at $175K+ base and 15%+ more options than standard.
