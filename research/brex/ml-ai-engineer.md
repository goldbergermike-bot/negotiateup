### ML/AI Engineer | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | AI-Native Accounting API | Zero-Day Close Platform | $12B+ Valuation | +15-25% AI Premium | **MAXIMIZE PRE-IPO OPTIONS BEFORE LISTING**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $198K–$252K | $188K–$332K | 15–20% | $272K–$385K |
| New York | $205K–$260K | $188K–$332K | 15–20% | $280K–$395K |
| Remote US | $192K–$245K | $188K–$332K | 15–20% | $265K–$378K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Brex ML/AI Engineers are the builders of the intelligence that powers the AI-first corporate card and spend management platform — designing, training, and deploying the machine learning models that drive transaction categorization, fraud detection, credit risk, spend prediction, and the AI-Native Accounting API that achieves Zero-Day Close. At the IC3-IC4 level with a 15-25% AI Premium over standard engineering compensation, you build the core AI systems that transform Brex from a fintech company into an AI-powered financial operating system. ML/AI engineers at Brex command premium compensation because the entire Zero-Day Close capability depends on the quality and reliability of the models they build — without AI, there is no automated accounting. Pre-IPO options are the highest-leverage comp lever — ML/AI engineers should negotiate the most aggressive option packages given their direct ownership of the AI capabilities that differentiate Brex from every competitor.

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As an ML/AI Engineer at Brex, you are the primary architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. You build the core ML models that make automated accounting possible — transaction categorization, intelligent reconciliation, anomaly detection, predictive accruals, and the AI orchestration that closes the books without human intervention. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform, and ML/AI engineers are the ones who build the intelligence that makes this transformation real. Your models are not incremental features — they are the fundamental technology that enables Zero-Day Close to exist. "As an ML/AI Engineer building the intelligence for Zero-Day Close, I design and deploy the models that automate the entire accounting close. My categorization models, reconciliation algorithms, and anomaly detectors are the core technology that makes the AI-Native Accounting API possible — without my ML systems, Zero-Day Close does not exist. Every model improvement I ship directly increases the accuracy and reliability of automated accounting, driving the enterprise adoption that makes Brex worth $12B+."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization + AI Premium:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — as an ML/AI engineer, I build the core AI models that power Zero-Day Close. I want 30% more options than the standard offer because my models are the fundamental technology differentiator — without AI, Brex is just another corporate card. The 15-25% AI Premium reflects market demand, and this pre-IPO window has asymmetric upside."
2. **Zero-Day Close AI Model Ownership:** "I build the ML models that make Zero-Day Close possible — transaction categorization, intelligent reconciliation, anomaly detection, and AI-driven close orchestration. My model accuracy directly determines whether automated accounting works at enterprise scale, making my contribution the most strategically important engineering work at Brex."
3. **Google/Meta AI Competition:** "Google ML L5 engineers earn $420K+ TC with public RSUs. Meta ML IC5 earns $435K+ TC. Brex must offer substantially more pre-IPO options plus the AI Premium to attract ML talent from FAANG — my expected TC must exceed $380K to compensate for pre-IPO illiquidity risk and reflect the AI talent premium."
4. **AI-First Platform Differentiation:** "I build the AI that makes Brex the only corporate card platform with true AI-native accounting. My ML models create the technical moat that Ramp, Navan, Airbase, and legacy vendors like SAP Concur and Coupa cannot replicate — training accounting AI at scale requires the proprietary transaction data and model architecture that I build."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $248K base and 30% more options than the standard equity offer for this ML/AI Engineer role at Brex pre-IPO, reflecting the 15-25% AI Premium. I build the core ML models powering the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close — my AI systems are the fundamental technology that makes automated accounting possible and sustains the $12B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Google ML L5 at $420K TC / Meta ML IC5 at $435K TC / Ramp ML at $375K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside for ML/AI engineers whose models are the primary product differentiator." Accept at $225K+ base and 20%+ more options than standard.
