### Data Engineer | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | AI-Native Accounting API | Zero-Day Close Platform | $12B+ Valuation | **MAXIMIZE PRE-IPO OPTIONS BEFORE LISTING**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $162K–$205K | $108K–$192K | 10–15% | $192K–$268K |
| New York | $168K–$212K | $108K–$192K | 10–15% | $198K–$275K |
| Remote US | $155K–$198K | $108K–$192K | 10–15% | $185K–$260K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Brex Data Engineers build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers the AI-first corporate card and spend management platform — owning data pipelines, warehousing, ETL systems, and the real-time data architecture that feeds both product analytics and the AI-Native Accounting API. At the IC2-IC3 level, you design the data systems that process millions of financial transactions daily, ensuring data accuracy, freshness, and reliability across the platform that thousands of companies depend on. Data engineers at Brex are strategically critical because the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close are entirely dependent on the quality and timeliness of the data infrastructure — AI accounting is only as good as the data pipelines that feed it. Pre-IPO options are the primary equity lever — data engineers should negotiate for larger grants given their foundational impact on AI capabilities. [Source: Brex DE Comp 2025-2026]

**AI-Native Accounting API — The Zero-Day Close Architect**

As a Data Engineer at Brex, you are an architect of the Zero-Day Close — the company's Jan 2026 launch of the AI-Native Accounting API that automates the entire accounting close process from days to zero. You build the data pipelines and infrastructure that make instant accounting possible — real-time transaction ingestion, data transformation, feature engineering for ML models, and the data quality systems that ensure AI-driven accounting decisions are accurate and auditable. Brex is no longer just a corporate card; it is the AI-first financial platform, and data engineers provide the foundational data layer that every AI capability depends on. Without reliable, real-time data infrastructure, Zero-Day Close is impossible. "As a Data Engineer building the data foundation for Zero-Day Close, I ensure that every transaction flows accurately through the data pipeline into the AI-Native Accounting API. AI accounting requires real-time, accurate, and auditable data — my pipeline architecture directly determines whether the AI models can make reliable accounting decisions. Every data quality improvement I ship increases the accuracy of Zero-Day Close and drives the enterprise adoption that sustains Brex's $12B+ valuation."

**Global Levers**

1. **Pre-IPO Option Maximization:** "I'm joining Brex pre-IPO at $12B+ valuation — as a data engineer, I build the data infrastructure that every AI capability depends on. I want 20% more options than the standard offer because the AI-Native Accounting API is only as good as the data pipelines I build, and this pre-IPO window has asymmetric upside."
2. **Zero-Day Close Data Foundation:** "I build the real-time data pipelines that power Zero-Day Close — transaction ingestion, data transformation, and feature engineering for AI accounting models. My data infrastructure determines whether the AI-Native Accounting API can process millions of transactions accurately, directly enabling enterprise adoption."
3. **Ramp/Stripe DE Competition:** "Ramp data engineers earn $262K+ TC with competitive equity. Stripe DEs earn $278K+ TC with near-liquid RSUs. Brex must offer more pre-IPO options to attract data engineering talent — my expected TC must reflect the foundational impact data infrastructure has on AI product capabilities."
4. **Financial Data Infrastructure Moat:** "I build the real-time financial data infrastructure that gives Brex's AI a data advantage. Every transaction processed through my pipelines trains better models and enables faster closes — this data infrastructure moat deepens with every customer and transaction, creating a compounding advantage over Ramp, Navan, and legacy vendors."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $202K base and 20% more options than the standard equity offer for this Data Engineer role at Brex pre-IPO. I build the data infrastructure powering the AI-Native Accounting API and Zero-Day Close — my data pipelines directly determine whether AI accounting works accurately at enterprise scale and sustains the $12B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Ramp DE at $262K TC / Stripe DE at $278K TC / Navan DE at $255K TC]. Pre-IPO options at Brex have asymmetric upside — I want to maximize my option position before the listing window closes." Accept at $182K+ base and 15%+ more options than standard.
