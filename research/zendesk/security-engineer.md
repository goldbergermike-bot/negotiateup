#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Zendesk

Security Engineers at Zendesk protect one of the largest repositories of customer interaction data in the world. Enterprise customers require SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and FedRAMP compliance — and Security Engineers build and maintain these certifications. Under PE ownership, security incidents carry heightened risk to the exit timeline.

| Security Engineer | SecEng (IC3-IC4) | 2–5 years |
| Senior Security Engineer | Senior SecEng (IC5) | 5–8 years |
| Staff Security Engineer | Staff SecEng (IC6) | 8–12 years |

### Zendesk AI-First CX & Private Equity Premium
