#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Zendesk

TPMs at a PE-backed company manage programs with direct exit timeline implications. Every engineering program must deliver on aggressive timelines that satisfy PE growth expectations. TPMs who can manage this pressure — coordinating across engineering, product, and data science — are essential to Zendesk's value creation.

| Principal TPM | Principal TPM (IC6) | 10–14 years |

### Zendesk AI-First CX & Private Equity Premium
