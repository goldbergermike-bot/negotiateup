**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Two Sigma design internal tools, research platforms, and trading interfaces used by quantitative researchers and portfolio managers. While the user base is small (internal), the stakes are extremely high: design decisions directly impact how efficiently researchers can explore data, test hypotheses, and manage risk. Compensation is structured as base plus annual bonus (80-150%+), far exceeding design compensation at tech companies.
