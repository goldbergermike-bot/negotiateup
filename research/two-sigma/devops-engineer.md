### DevOps Engineer | Two Sigma Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Elite quant hedge fund + $60B+ AUM + NYC HQ + ELITE comp + Bonus 100-150%+ | Two Sigma infrastructure must be financial-grade reliable | **ELITE QUANT INFRASTRUCTURE PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Bonus (Annual) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| New York City (HQ) | $175K–$245K | $140K–$370K+ | $315K–$615K+ |
| Houston | $160K–$225K | $128K–$340K+ | $288K–$565K+ |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Two Sigma build and maintain the infrastructure that powers the firm's quantitative investment operations. This includes compute clusters, network infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and monitoring systems that must operate with financial-grade reliability. Infrastructure failures can directly impact trading execution and investment returns.

Compensation is base plus annual performance bonus (100-150%+ for DevOps roles). While DevOps bonuses are typically lower than research engineering bonuses, total comp still far exceeds tech company DevOps packages.
