**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Two Sigma build the data infrastructure that ingests, processes, and serves the massive datasets powering the firm's quantitative investment strategies. This includes alternative data pipelines, market data systems, and large-scale data platforms that must operate with financial-grade reliability and low latency. The quality and speed of data directly impacts alpha generation, making data engineering one of the most impactful roles at the firm.

Compensation is base plus annual performance bonus (100-200%+ for strong performers). No equity (private firm), but cash-heavy structure means immediate income. The hiring bar is elite -- top CS programs, competitive programming, or significant distributed systems experience required.
