**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Two Sigma apply advanced statistical modeling, machine learning, and quantitative analysis to investment problems. The DS role at Two Sigma is closely aligned with quantitative research -- data scientists develop signals, analyze market microstructure, and build predictive models that directly inform trading strategies. PhD-level quantitative expertise is typically required, and compensation reflects the elite nature of the work.

Compensation is base plus annual performance bonus (100-200%+ for strong performers). DS compensation is among the highest at Two Sigma, reflecting the direct alpha generation potential. The distinction between Data Scientist and Quantitative Researcher is fluid, with significant overlap.

**Level Mapping:** Data Scientist at Two Sigma = Research Scientist at Google, IC5-IC6 at Meta, Applied Scientist at Amazon, no equivalent at traditional banks

**The Alpha Generation DS Premium**

Two Sigma data scientists' models directly generate investment returns. A single improvement to a signal model can be worth millions in annual returns. This direct P&L attribution, combined with the extreme scarcity of professionals who combine PhD-level quantitative skills with financial domain expertise, drives compensation to elite levels.
