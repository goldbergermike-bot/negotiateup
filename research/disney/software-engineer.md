### Software Engineer | Disney Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $200B Entertainment-Tech Empire | Disney+ / Parks Tech / ESPN | Premium Entertainment Tech Comp

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Burbank / Los Angeles | $135K–$195K | $50K–$160K | 10-15% | $170K–$280K |
| San Francisco / Seattle | $140K–$200K | $55K–$170K | 10-15% | $180K–$295K |
| London (UK) | £100K–£145K | £35K–£115K | 10-15% | $135K–$220K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Disney build technology that powers the world's most beloved entertainment company. With a $200B market cap headquartered in Burbank, CA, Disney operates across Disney+ streaming (150M+ subscribers), Parks & Experiences technology (smart attractions, mobile apps, MagicBand+), ESPN digital platforms, and studio production technology. Disney's SWEs don't just write code — they create the technology that delivers magic to hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Whether you're building Disney+ streaming features, Parks guest experience technology, or ESPN's live sports platform, your work touches consumers who have deep emotional connections to Disney's brands.

Disney's compensation philosophy positions engineering pay at the premium end of entertainment-tech, above traditional media companies and competitive with mid-tier Big Tech. Base salaries of $135K-$195K, RSU grants up to $160K over four years, and 10-15% bonuses bring total comp to $170K-$280K — reflecting Disney's recognition that competing for top engineering talent requires packages that approach Big Tech levels.

**Disney Entertainment-Tech Premium**

Disney's technology investment has expanded dramatically as the company transforms from a traditional entertainment conglomerate into a technology-powered entertainment platform. Disney+ is a massive technology platform competing with Netflix and Amazon. Parks & Experiences deploys IoT, mobile technology, and data analytics at a scale that rivals consumer tech companies. ESPN is evolving into a digital-first sports platform. This technology transformation means Disney SWEs work on genuinely interesting engineering problems — and the company is willing to pay for talent that can deliver on its technology ambitions.

**Global Levers**

1. **Premium Brand Engineering:** "I'll be building technology for the most recognized entertainment brand in the world. Disney's products — Disney+, Parks technology, ESPN — reach hundreds of millions of consumers who have deep brand loyalty. Engineering quality directly impacts brand perception, and I'd like a base of $[X]K that reflects this premium responsibility."

2. **Multi-Platform Impact:** "Disney's technology spans streaming, theme parks, live sports, and studio production — a breadth of engineering challenges that is unique in the industry. I'll contribute across a portfolio that generates $90B+ in annual revenue. This multi-platform impact warrants RSUs of $[Y]K over four years."

3. **Big Tech Competition:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/Meta] at $[X]K total comp. While I'm passionate about Disney's entertainment-tech mission, the package needs to be competitive. Can we discuss increasing the total comp to close the gap?"

4. **Entertainment-Tech Talent Scarcity:** "Engineers who can build consumer-scale technology AND understand the nuances of entertainment content delivery are rare. My experience in [streaming/consumer apps/mobile platforms] combined with my passion for Disney's brands makes me a strong cultural and technical fit — and I'd like the compensation to reflect this match."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. Building technology for Disney is genuinely exciting — few companies combine this level of brand power with this scale of engineering challenges. To align with my market value: a base increase to $[X+10-15]K, RSU grant of $[Y+30-50]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[25-40]K to offset unvested equity. My competing offer from [competitor] is $[TC]K. At approximately $[230-280]K total comp, I believe this reflects both the competitive market and the premium nature of engineering at Disney. I'm ready to sign."
