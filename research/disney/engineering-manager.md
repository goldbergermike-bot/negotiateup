### Engineering Manager | Disney Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $200B Entertainment-Tech Empire | Multi-Team Technical Leadership | Disney+ / Parks / ESPN Team Building

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Burbank / Los Angeles | $170K–$240K | $80K–$225K | 15-20% | $240K–$400K |
| San Francisco / Seattle | $175K–$245K | $85K–$235K | 15-20% | $250K–$415K |
| London (UK) | £130K–£180K | £60K–£165K | 15-20% | $185K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Disney lead teams that build technology for the most beloved entertainment brands in the world. Whether you're managing a Disney+ streaming engineering team, a Parks technology team, or an ESPN digital platform team, you're hiring and growing world-class engineers, setting technical direction, and delivering against ambitious product roadmaps at a $200B company. Disney EMs are expected to combine strong technical depth with the people leadership skills needed to attract, develop, and retain top talent — particularly challenging in the competitive entertainment-tech talent market.

Disney has invested heavily in engineering management, recruiting leaders from Google, Amazon, Netflix, and Apple to elevate its technology culture and execution quality. EMs at Disney have significant ownership over team strategy, hiring, and technical direction, and the role offers a unique combination of meaningful work and premium compensation.

**Level Mapping:** Disney EM (M1-M2) = Google L5-L6 Manager = Meta E5-E6 Manager = Amazon L6-L7 Manager = Microsoft 63-65 Manager

**Disney Leadership Premium**

Disney's Engineering Managers have a unique talent attraction advantage: the company's mission resonates deeply with engineers. However, this advantage only works if EM compensation is competitive enough to attract managers who can then recruit top talent. Disney has recognized this dynamic and increased EM comp significantly, positioning it at the premium end of entertainment-tech and competitive with mid-tier Big Tech management roles.

**Global Levers**

1. **Premium Brand Leadership:** "Leading engineering teams at Disney means building technology for the world's most iconic entertainment brands. This requires managers who can attract top talent AND maintain the quality bar that Disney's brand demands. I'd like a base of $[225-240]K reflecting this dual leadership requirement."

2. **Talent Attraction Multiplier:** "My ability to recruit and retain top engineers from Big Tech directly impacts Disney's technology capabilities. My hiring track record — building teams of [X] engineers from [Big Tech companies] — demonstrates ROI on competitive EM compensation. Investing in my comp enables me to invest in my team."

3. **Cross-Business Management Scope:** "I'll manage teams whose work spans Disney+, Parks, and ESPN — each with different technical stacks, product rhythms, and user expectations. This cross-business management scope is equivalent to Director-level roles at single-product companies."

4. **Big Tech Management Competition:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/Netflix] at the [L6/L7] management level with total comp of $[X]K. While I strongly prefer Disney's mission, the package needs to be competitive for me to make the move."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about leading engineering at Disney — building teams that create technology for the world's most beloved brands is exactly the kind of leadership impact I want. To align with market rates: a base of $[230-240]K, RSU grant of $[200-225]K over four years, a 20% bonus target, and a signing bonus of $[40-60]K. My competing offer from [competitor] is $[X]K. At approximately $[350-400]K, this reflects the premium EM market and the unique scope of managing engineering at Disney. I'm ready to lead."
