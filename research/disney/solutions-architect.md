| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

| Burbank / Los Angeles | $155K–$215K | $60K–$175K | 12-15% | $200K–$325K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Disney design the technical architecture connecting Disney's complex entertainment ecosystem — Disney+ streaming, Parks & Experiences technology, ESPN digital platforms, Disney Media & Entertainment Distribution, and enterprise operations. This role requires deep technical expertise and the ability to translate entertainment business requirements into scalable, reliable technical designs. Whether you're architecting the integration between Disney+ and Hulu, designing Parks guest experience technology systems, or building the technical framework for ESPN's live sports delivery, you shape how Disney's technology supports its entertainment mission.

Solutions Architects at Disney operate at the intersection of engineering, product, and business — working with creative teams (Imagineering, Studios), technology organizations, and business stakeholders to design solutions that leverage Disney's full technology portfolio.

**Level Mapping:** Disney Solutions Architect (IC4-IC5) = Google Cloud Customer Engineer L5-L6 = AWS Solutions Architect (Senior/Principal) = Microsoft Azure Architect 64-66

**Disney Architecture Premium**

Disney's Solutions Architects have a unique challenge: designing for both digital experiences (streaming, apps) and physical experiences (Parks technology, retail). This dual-domain architecture expertise is rare and enables Disney to create seamlessly integrated experiences — a guest might browse Disney+ on their phone, purchase Park tickets through the app, use MagicBand+ in the Park, and return home to continue streaming. Architects who can design for this end-to-end experience journey create enormous strategic value.

**Global Levers**

1. **Digital + Physical Architecture:** "Disney's unique architecture spans digital streaming platforms and physical Parks technology — a dual-domain challenge that doesn't exist at pure tech companies. My architecture experience across [digital + physical/IoT] is exactly this expertise. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Cross-Platform Integration Design:** "I'll design architectures that connect Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, Parks, and enterprise systems into a unified Disney ecosystem. This cross-platform integration creates the seamless consumer experience that drives Disney's competitive advantage. RSUs of $[Y]K over four years reflects this strategic value."

3. **Competing Architecture Offers:** "I have competing offers from [AWS/Google Cloud/Microsoft Azure] at $[X]K total comp. Disney's architecture challenges are more compelling, but the compensation needs to be competitive."

4. **Entertainment + Technology Hybrid:** "Few architects understand both entertainment business requirements and technology architecture at this level. I bring this dual perspective from my experience at [company], and it directly enables me to design solutions that serve Disney's unique entertainment-tech mission."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about designing Disney's technical architecture — connecting streaming, parks, and sports into a unified entertainment platform is a world-class architecture challenge. To align with market rates: a base of $[200-215]K, RSU grant of $[155-175]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[30-40]K. My competing offer from [AWS/Google Cloud] is $[X]K. At $[285-325]K, this reflects the cross-platform scope and strategic value of solutions architecture at a $200B entertainment company. I'm ready to commit."
