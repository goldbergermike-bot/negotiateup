### Senior Software Engineer | Disney Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $200B Entertainment-Tech Empire | Senior Technical Ownership | Disney+ / Parks / ESPN Architecture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Burbank / Los Angeles | $160K–$220K | $70K–$195K | 12-15% | $215K–$345K |
| San Francisco / Seattle | $165K–$225K | $75K–$205K | 12-15% | $225K–$360K |
| London (UK) | £120K–£165K | £50K–£145K | 12-15% | $170K–$270K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Disney are the technical leaders who own the architecture and implementation of systems serving hundreds of millions of consumers. At the Senior level, you drive technical decisions for Disney+ streaming features, Parks guest experience platforms, ESPN digital sports delivery, or studio production technology. Disney's Senior SWEs are expected to combine deep technical expertise with product thinking — understanding how technology decisions impact the guest/viewer experience and Disney's business outcomes.

Disney has significantly invested in its Senior SWE track, recognizing that retaining senior technical talent is critical to the company's technology transformation. Total comp at $215K-$360K is competitive with mid-to-upper-tier Big Tech, and the company offers the unique draw of working on technology that millions of people interact with and love.

**Level Mapping:** Disney Senior SWE (IC4) = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Amazon SDE III = Microsoft 63 = Apple ICT4 = Netflix Senior SWE

**Disney Senior Engineering Premium**

Senior SWEs at Disney have an outsized impact because the company's technology decisions directly affect beloved brands worth tens of billions. A Senior SWE on Disney+ owns streaming features experienced by 150M+ subscribers. A Senior SWE on Parks technology architects systems that shape guest experiences for 150M+ annual park visitors. The emotional connection consumers have with Disney products means engineering quality has a brand impact that goes beyond typical tech companies.

**Global Levers**

1. **Senior Technical Ownership at Scale:** "At the Senior SWE level, I'll own architecture and technical direction for systems serving hundreds of millions of consumers across Disney's platforms. This ownership spans both technical complexity and brand responsibility. I'd like a base of $[205-220]K reflecting this senior-level accountability."

2. **Premium Brand-Tech Intersection:** "Senior engineers at Disney don't just build technology — they shape how consumers experience the world's most valuable entertainment brands. This intersection of technical excellence and brand stewardship is unique and commands premium compensation. I'd like RSUs of $[170-195]K over four years."

3. **Big Tech Counter-Offers:** "I have competing offers from [Google/Meta/Amazon] at the L5/E5/SDE III level with total comp of $[350-420]K. While I strongly prefer Disney's mission, the gap needs to narrow. Can we discuss increasing the RSU component to close this difference?"

4. **Multi-Platform Technical Leadership:** "I'll provide senior technical leadership across Disney's portfolio — streaming, parks, sports, and entertainment. Senior engineers who can think across these business domains and provide architectural guidance that spans multiple platforms are rare and valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm very excited about the Senior SWE role — providing technical leadership for technology that delights hundreds of millions of Disney consumers is deeply meaningful work. To align with the market: a base of $[210-220]K, RSU grant of $[175-195]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[35-50]K. My competing offer from [Google/Meta] is $[X]K at the L5/E5 level. At approximately $[305-345]K, I believe this fairly reflects senior engineering impact at a $200B entertainment-tech company. I'd choose Disney — let's align on the numbers."
