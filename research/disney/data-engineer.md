### Data Engineer | Disney Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $200B Entertainment-Tech Empire | Consumer Intelligence at Scale | Cross-Platform Data Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Burbank / Los Angeles | $135K–$195K | $50K–$160K | 10-15% | $170K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Disney build the data infrastructure that powers consumer intelligence across the world's most valuable entertainment portfolio. With 150M+ Disney+ subscribers, 150M+ annual theme park visitors, millions of ESPN viewers, and a global merchandise operation, Disney generates massive volumes of consumer data that inform content decisions, personalization, advertising, and guest experience optimization. Data Engineers design the pipelines, warehouses, and streaming architectures that transform this raw data into actionable intelligence for every business unit.

Disney's data platform unifies consumer behavior across streaming, parks, sports, and retail — creating a 360-degree view of the Disney consumer that enables cross-platform personalization, content strategy optimization, and targeted marketing. Data Engineers who build this unified intelligence layer are directly enabling Disney's competitive advantage.

**Level Mapping:** Disney Data Engineer (IC2-IC4) = Google L3-L5 Data Engineer = Meta E3-E5 Data Engineer = Amazon DE II-III = Comcast T3-T5

**Disney Consumer Data Premium**

Disney's consumer data is uniquely valuable because it spans entertainment consumption (Disney+ viewership), physical experiences (Parks visits, MagicBand+ interactions), sports engagement (ESPN viewing), and retail behavior (merchandise, licensing). No other company has this breadth of consumer entertainment data. Data Engineers who can build infrastructure that connects these data domains create cross-platform intelligence that drives billions in revenue optimization.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Platform Data Integration:** "Disney's data advantage comes from connecting streaming, parks, sports, and retail data into a unified consumer platform. I bring experience building cross-domain data pipelines at [company], and this expertise directly supports Disney's data strategy. I'd like a base of $[X]K."

2. **Revenue-Driving Data Infrastructure:** "The data pipelines I build will power Disney+'s content recommendations (driving retention), Parks guest personalization (driving per-capita spending), and ESPN advertising (driving ad revenue). This multi-revenue-stream data impact warrants RSUs of $[Y]K over four years."

3. **Consumer Scale Data Expertise:** "Processing data for 150M+ streaming subscribers and 150M+ park visitors requires expertise in large-scale data architectures. My experience with [Spark/Kafka/Snowflake] at [scale] positions me to deliver immediately. This scale expertise commands market premium."

4. **Competing Data Platform Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Snowflake/Databricks/Google/Netflix] at $[X]K total comp. Disney's cross-platform data opportunity is more compelling, but the compensation needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. Building Disney's unified data platform — connecting streaming, parks, sports, and retail intelligence — is a genuinely unique opportunity. To align with my market value: a base increase to $[X+10-15]K, RSU grant of $[Y+30-50]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[20-35]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K. At approximately $[230-280]K, this reflects the cross-platform scope and revenue impact of data engineering at Disney. I'm ready to accept."
