**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Disney protect the most valuable entertainment intellectual property in the world AND the personal data of hundreds of millions of consumers. Disney's security challenges are uniquely complex: safeguarding unreleased Marvel and Star Wars content (where a single leak can cost hundreds of millions in lost box office and streaming impact), protecting consumer financial and personal data across Disney+, Parks, and ESPN, securing physical technology systems in theme parks, and defending against sophisticated threat actors who target Disney because of its brand visibility.

Disney has built a mature security organization that spans content protection (DRM, anti-piracy), application security, network security, identity and access management, and physical security for Parks technology. Security Engineers are embedded across business units and have significant influence on product and infrastructure decisions.

**Disney Content + Consumer Security Premium**

Disney's security requirements are uniquely demanding because of the dual imperative: protecting the world's most valuable entertainment IP AND protecting consumer data at massive scale. A content leak of an unreleased Marvel film can cost hundreds of millions in market impact. A consumer data breach affecting Disney+ subscribers would damage trust in one of the world's most trusted brands. Security Engineers who can protect both content and consumers bring extraordinary value.

**Global Levers**

1. **Premium IP Protection Responsibility:** "I'll protect intellectual property worth tens of billions — unreleased Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar content. A single content leak can cost hundreds of millions. This content protection responsibility exceeds typical security roles and warrants premium compensation at $[X]K base."

2. **Dual-Domain Security Scope:** "Disney's security spans both digital (streaming, consumer data, payment systems) and physical (Parks IoT, ride systems, guest experiences). Security Engineers with this dual-domain expertise are rare. I'd like RSUs of $[Y]K reflecting this breadth."

3. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "The cybersecurity talent shortage is well-documented, and engineers with both content protection and application security expertise are exceptionally rare. My experience at [company] in [security domains] makes me highly competitive in this market."

4. **Brand Trust Protection:** "Disney's brand trust is perhaps its most valuable asset. A security incident at Disney doesn't just cost money — it damages a brand that billions of people trust with their families' entertainment. Protecting this trust is worth premium security compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. Protecting Disney's IP and consumer data is a security challenge I'm uniquely qualified for and deeply motivated by. To align with market rates: a base of $[190-205]K, RSU grant of $[140-165]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[25-40]K. My competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto/Google] is $[X]K. At $[260-300]K, this reflects the security talent premium and the unique IP protection responsibility. I'm ready to defend Disney."
