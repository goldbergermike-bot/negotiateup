**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Disney work at the intersection of entertainment, technology, and consumer behavior — building models that optimize content strategy, personalize guest experiences, and maximize advertising yield across the world's most iconic entertainment brands. With Disney+ viewership data, Parks guest behavior, ESPN sports engagement, and merchandise purchasing patterns, Disney offers Data Scientists a uniquely rich and diverse dataset that enables cross-domain consumer intelligence at a scale no other entertainment company can match.

Disney has invested heavily in data science capabilities, building dedicated teams for Disney+ personalization, Parks guest analytics, ESPN audience intelligence, and advertising optimization. The company's data science organization is growing rapidly, and compensation reflects Disney's commitment to attracting top analytical talent from Big Tech and streaming competitors.

**Disney Entertainment Intelligence Premium**

Disney's data science is uniquely impactful because models built at Disney directly shape entertainment consumption for hundreds of millions of people. A recommendation model on Disney+ determines what content 150M+ subscribers watch next. A pricing model for Parks determines revenue per guest for 150M+ annual visitors. A content valuation model influences billions in production spending. Data Scientists at Disney aren't just optimizing metrics — they're shaping how the world experiences entertainment.

**Global Levers**

1. **Entertainment-Scale Analytics:** "I'll build models that impact 150M+ Disney+ subscribers, 150M+ park visitors, and millions of ESPN viewers. The scale and diversity of Disney's consumer analytics is unmatched in entertainment. I'd like a base of $[X]K reflecting this unique analytical scope."

2. **Revenue-Impacting Models:** "My models will directly drive Disney+ subscriber retention, Parks per-capita spending, ESPN advertising yield, and content investment ROI. These are not exploratory analytics — they're production systems with direct P&L attribution. I'd like RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Cross-Domain Consumer Intelligence:** "Disney's unique data advantage — connecting streaming, parks, sports, and retail — requires data scientists who can build cross-domain models. This multi-domain analytical expertise is rare and valuable. The total comp should reflect this at $[X]K."

4. **AI/ML Talent Market:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Netflix/Meta] at $[X]K total comp. The market for data scientists with production ML experience and consumer analytics expertise is very competitive. Disney's offer should reflect this reality."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about this role — applying data science across Disney's entertainment portfolio to personalize experiences for hundreds of millions of consumers is dream analytical work. To align with market rates: a base of $[185-200]K, RSU grant of $[140-165]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[25-35]K. My competing offer from [competitor] is $[X]K. At approximately $[250-290]K, this reflects the revenue impact and cross-domain scope of data science at a $200B entertainment-tech company. I'm ready to accept."
