**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026. "As a Data Scientist, I analyze autonomous vehicle performance data — safety metrics, rider satisfaction, route efficiency — alongside human-driven trip data. My analyses determine whether and how robotaxis scale beyond London and Munich. This comparative analysis (autonomous vs human) exists nowhere else at city scale."

**Global Levers**

1. **World's Richest Mobility Dataset:** "I analyze billions of trips across 70+ countries — the largest real-time mobility and delivery dataset in the world. My insights drive pricing, matching, and marketplace optimization at global scale."
2. **Robotaxi Performance Analytics:** "I analyze autonomous vs human-driven trip data — safety, efficiency, satisfaction. My analyses determine the robotaxi expansion roadmap beyond London and Munich."
3. **Real-Time Marketplace Dynamics:** "Uber's two-sided marketplace generates uniquely complex supply/demand dynamics. My analyses optimize real-time pricing and matching across thousands of simultaneous markets."
4. **Dual Marketplace Analytics:** "I analyze both Mobility AND Delivery data — two business lines with interconnected demand patterns. My insights drive strategy across Uber's entire dual marketplace."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $232K base and $302K RSUs over 4 years for this DS role. I analyze the world's richest mobility dataset — billions of trips across 70+ countries — plus robotaxi performance data. I have competing DS offers from [Lyft at $305K TC / Google at $318K TC]. Uber's data scale and robotaxi analytics are unique." Accept at $215K+ base and $272K+ RSUs.
