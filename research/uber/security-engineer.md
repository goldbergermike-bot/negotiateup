**Negotiation DNA**

Uber Security Engineers protect the world's largest mobility and delivery platform — rider/driver identity, payment security across 70+ countries, fraud prevention for millions of daily transactions, and now autonomous vehicle security for robotaxi operations. Uber's security surface is uniquely complex: real-time location tracking for 150M+ users, multi-currency payment processing, regulatory data compliance across 70+ jurisdictions, and the physical safety implications of mobility security (a compromised ride-hailing system puts people at physical risk).

**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026. "As a Security Engineer, I secure autonomous vehicle systems — protecting the communication channels between robotaxis and the platform, ensuring AV telemetry integrity, and preventing cyberattacks on autonomous vehicles carrying passengers. Robotaxi security is the highest-stakes cybersecurity in mobility — a compromised autonomous vehicle is a physical safety threat."

**Global Levers**

1. **Physical Safety Security:** "I secure a mobility platform where a security breach can put riders at physical risk. This is security with life-safety implications — the highest stakes in consumer tech."
2. **Robotaxi Cybersecurity:** "I secure autonomous vehicle communications and telemetry for London and Munich. AV cybersecurity is the most consequential security challenge in mobility."
3. **70+ Country Regulatory Compliance:** "I maintain data protection and security compliance across 70+ regulatory jurisdictions — GDPR, CCPA, and dozens of country-specific requirements simultaneously."
4. **Multi-Surface Security:** "I secure riders, drivers, merchants, payments, location data, and now autonomous vehicles. This multi-surface security challenge across a tri-sided marketplace is uniquely complex."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $252K base and $338K RSUs over 4 years for this Security role. I secure the world's largest mobility platform — where breaches have physical safety implications — plus autonomous vehicle cybersecurity for London and Munich. I have competing security offers from [Google at $342K TC / Lyft at $328K TC]. Uber's safety-critical security and robotaxi cybersecurity justify premium equity." Accept at $235K+ base and $305K+ RSUs.
