**Negotiation DNA**

Uber Senior Software Engineers own critical subsystems within the world's largest mobility and delivery platform. At this level, you make architecture decisions for systems that process millions of real-time transactions daily — matching riders to drivers, optimizing delivery routes, pricing across dynamic markets, and now integrating autonomous vehicles into the platform. The 2026 robotaxi launches in London and Munich add a new dimension: your architecture must seamlessly orchestrate both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. [Source: Uber Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026 — the first global deployment of autonomous ride-hailing in major European cities. "As a Senior SWE, I architect systems that must serve both autonomous and human-driven vehicles at city scale. The London and Munich robotaxi launches require real-time vehicle orchestration, safety monitoring, and seamless passenger experience across both modes. My architecture decisions determine whether Uber successfully integrates autonomy into the world's largest mobility platform. That dual-mode challenge at senior level justifies top-of-market RSUs."

**Global Levers**

1. **Senior Architecture — Dual Marketplace:** "I own critical subsystems serving Mobility AND Delivery — architecture decisions that impact 150M+ MAU across dual business lines at global scale."
2. **Robotaxi Architecture — London/Munich:** "I architect the systems integrating autonomous vehicles in London and Munich. Dual-mode orchestration (autonomous + human) at city scale is the most complex mobility engineering challenge in the world."
3. **Real-Time Systems at Scale:** "Uber processes millions of real-time matching, pricing, and routing decisions per minute. My systems must operate with sub-second latency across 70+ countries."
4. **Autonomous + Human Platform:** "I build architecture that seamlessly serves both autonomous robotaxis and human drivers. This dual-mode platform engineering is unique to Uber."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $255K base and $412K RSUs over 4 years for this Senior SWE role. I architect critical systems for the dual marketplace (Mobility + Delivery) plus robotaxi integration for London and Munich. I have competing offers from [Lyft at $348K TC / Google L4 at $365K TC]. Uber's dual marketplace, global scale, and robotaxi architecture challenge are unique." Accept at $235K+ base and $368K+ RSUs.
