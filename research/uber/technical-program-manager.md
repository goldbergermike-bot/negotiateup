### Technical Program Manager | Uber Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Performance Bonus | Mobility & Delivery Platform | Robotaxi Expansion (London/Munich 2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|

**Negotiation DNA**

Uber TPMs coordinate programs across the most complex real-time marketplace in tech — mobility launches in new cities, delivery vertical expansion, regulatory compliance across 70+ countries, payment system integrations, and now the robotaxi launch programs for London and Munich. Uber TPMs manage some of the highest-stakes programs in tech: every city launch has regulatory, operational, and technical dependencies that must be orchestrated perfectly.

**Level Mapping:** Uber TPM = Google L4 TPM = Lyft TPM = DoorDash TPM

**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026. "As a TPM, I coordinate the robotaxi launch programs — aligning AV partner integration, regulatory approval, city operations, and platform readiness across multiple workstreams. The London and Munich launches are the highest-stakes programs at Uber, with regulatory, safety, and public perception implications beyond standard city launches."

**Global Levers**

1. **Robotaxi Launch Programs:** "I coordinate the London and Munich robotaxi launches — the highest-stakes programs at Uber. Multi-workstream coordination across AV partners, regulators, operations, and engineering."
2. **70+ Country Program Complexity:** "I manage programs across 70+ regulatory environments. Each city launch, feature rollout, and compliance milestone has country-specific dependencies."
3. **Dual Marketplace Coordination:** "I coordinate across Mobility and Delivery — program delivery for two business lines with shared infrastructure and independent roadmaps."
4. **Safety-Critical Program Management:** "Mobility programs are safety-critical. My program coordination directly impacts rider and driver safety across millions of daily trips."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $262K RSUs over 4 years for this TPM role. I coordinate programs for the world's largest dual marketplace — including the highest-stakes robotaxi launches in London and Munich. I have competing TPM offers from [Google at $292K TC / Lyft at $288K TC]. Uber's program complexity and robotaxi launches are unique." Accept at $208K+ base and $235K+ RSUs.
