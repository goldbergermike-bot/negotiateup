**Negotiation DNA**

Uber Software Engineers build the platform powering the world's largest mobility and delivery marketplace — 150M+ monthly active users, 6M+ drivers/couriers, operating in 70+ countries and 10,000+ cities. Uber's dual marketplace (Mobility + Delivery) means your infrastructure work serves two massive business lines simultaneously. In 2026, Uber's autonomous vehicle partnerships are expanding with robotaxi launches in London and Munich, making Uber the first global platform to integrate autonomous and human-driven mobility at city scale.

**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026 — the first global deployment of autonomous ride-hailing in major European cities. This transforms Uber from a marketplace that connects riders with human drivers to a platform that orchestrates autonomous AND human-driven vehicles. "I build the platform that's integrating robotaxis into the world's largest mobility marketplace. Uber's London and Munich robotaxi launches in 2026 make this the only company deploying autonomous mobility at global city scale. Every engineer at Uber is building infrastructure that must serve both autonomous and human-driven vehicles — a dual-mode challenge no other company faces. My comp should reflect that I'm building the platform for the autonomous mobility era, not just a ride-hailing app."

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual Marketplace — Mobility + Delivery:** "I build infrastructure serving both the world's largest ride-hailing platform AND delivery marketplace — 150M+ MAU across two business lines. My engineering has 2x the revenue surface of a single-vertical competitor."
2. **Robotaxi Integration — London/Munich 2026:** "Uber's robotaxi launches in London and Munich make this the first company deploying autonomous mobility in major European cities. I build the platform that integrates autonomous and human-driven vehicles at global scale."
3. **70+ Country Global Scale:** "Uber operates in 70+ countries and 10,000+ cities. My engineering decisions must account for regulatory complexity, multi-currency payments, and global reliability at a scale no competitor matches."
4. **Dual-Mode Autonomous Platform:** "Uber's robotaxi integration means I build for both autonomous and human-driven vehicles on one platform. This dual-mode orchestration challenge is unique to Uber and commands premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $212K base and $258K RSUs over 4 years for this Software Engineer role. I build the dual marketplace platform — Mobility AND Delivery — serving 150M+ MAU across 70+ countries, plus the robotaxi integration for London and Munich launches in 2026. I have competing offers from [Lyft at $268K TC / DoorDash at $272K TC]. Uber's global scale, dual marketplace, and robotaxi expansion are uniquely compelling." Accept at $195K+ base and $232K+ RSUs.
