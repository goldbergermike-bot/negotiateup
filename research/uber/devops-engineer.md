**Negotiation DNA**

Uber DevOps Engineers operate the infrastructure powering the world's largest real-time mobility and delivery marketplace — systems that must maintain 99.99%+ uptime across 70+ countries because downtime means riders can't get home and delivery orders spoil. This is safety-critical infrastructure: real-time matching, GPS tracking, payments, and now autonomous vehicle orchestration. The 2026 robotaxi launches in London and Munich add autonomous vehicle monitoring and safety systems to the infrastructure portfolio. [Source: Uber DevOps Comp 2025-2026]
