**Negotiation DNA**

Uber DevOps Engineers operate the infrastructure powering the world's largest real-time mobility and delivery marketplace — systems that must maintain 99.99%+ uptime across 70+ countries because downtime means riders can't get home and delivery orders spoil. This is safety-critical infrastructure: real-time matching, GPS tracking, payments, and now autonomous vehicle orchestration. The 2026 robotaxi launches in London and Munich add autonomous vehicle monitoring and safety systems to the infrastructure portfolio. [Source: Uber DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026. "As a DevOps Engineer, I operate the infrastructure that must safely orchestrate both autonomous and human-driven vehicles. Robotaxi infrastructure adds real-time safety monitoring, vehicle health telemetry, and autonomous system oversight to the platform. Downtime in robotaxi infrastructure isn't just a business problem — it's a public safety concern."

2. **Robotaxi Infrastructure:** "I operate autonomous vehicle infrastructure — safety monitoring, telemetry, and oversight systems for London and Munich. This is safety-critical ops at a level beyond standard cloud infrastructure."
3. **Global Scale Operations:** "Uber's infrastructure spans 70+ countries, thousands of markets, and millions of real-time transactions per minute. Global ops at this scale with safety criticality is unique."
