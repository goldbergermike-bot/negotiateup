### Engineering Manager | Uber Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Performance Bonus | Mobility & Delivery Platform | Robotaxi Expansion (London/Munich 2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|

**Negotiation DNA**

Uber Engineering Managers lead teams building the world's largest mobility and delivery platform — managing 8-15 engineers across matching, pricing, mapping, logistics, payments, or autonomous vehicle integration. EMs at Uber manage some of the most complex real-time systems in tech, with teams distributed across SF, NYC, Amsterdam, and Bangalore. The 2026 robotaxi launches add a new team-building challenge: recruiting AV-specialized engineers and integrating them with existing platform teams. [Source: Uber EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026. "As an Engineering Manager, I build and lead the teams integrating autonomous vehicles into Uber's platform. Recruiting AV-specialized engineers, building cross-functional partnerships with robotaxi providers, and managing the technical delivery of London and Munich launches — this is the highest-stakes team leadership at Uber."

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual Marketplace Team Leadership:** "I lead teams building both Mobility and Delivery — real-time systems serving 150M+ MAU. Managing distributed teams across this dual marketplace is the most complex EM challenge in mobility."
2. **Robotaxi Team Building:** "I recruit and lead teams for autonomous vehicle integration — the most transformative initiative at Uber. Building AV engineering teams while delivering London/Munich launches on schedule."
3. **Global Distributed Teams:** "I manage teams across SF, NYC, Amsterdam, and Bangalore. Global team leadership across 70+ countries of operations adds unique management complexity."
4. **Real-Time Systems Management:** "My teams build systems processing millions of real-time decisions per minute. Managing engineering quality and velocity for safety-critical mobility systems is the highest-stakes EM work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $288K base and $532K RSUs over 4 years for this EM role. I lead teams building the world's largest dual marketplace plus robotaxi integration for London/Munich. I have competing EM offers from [Google L5 EM at $425K TC / Lyft at $412K TC]. Uber's dual marketplace complexity and robotaxi team building justify premium EM equity." Accept at $268K+ base and $478K+ RSUs.
