**Negotiation DNA**

Uber Data Engineers build the data infrastructure powering the world's largest real-time marketplace — trip data pipelines, supply/demand analytics, pricing optimization data, delivery logistics telemetry, and now autonomous vehicle data streams from robotaxi operations. Uber processes petabytes of real-time data daily across 70+ countries, with millisecond-latency requirements for matching, pricing, and routing. [Source: Uber DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026. "As a Data Engineer, I build the data pipelines ingesting autonomous vehicle telemetry — sensor data, route performance, safety metrics, and rider satisfaction signals from robotaxi trips. This AV data infrastructure enables the analytics that determine whether robotaxis expand beyond London and Munich."

**Global Levers**

1. **Petabyte-Scale Real-Time Data:** "I build data pipelines processing petabytes daily with millisecond latency — real-time trip data, pricing signals, and matching analytics across 70+ countries."
2. **Robotaxi Data Pipelines:** "I build AV telemetry pipelines — sensor data, safety metrics, route performance from London and Munich robotaxis. This data infrastructure enables the autonomous expansion roadmap."
3. **Dual Marketplace Data Infrastructure:** "I build data infrastructure serving both Mobility and Delivery — two business lines with shared and independent data needs at massive scale."
4. **Real-Time Marketplace Analytics:** "My pipelines power real-time pricing, matching, and routing decisions for millions of trips per day. Data latency directly impacts marketplace efficiency and revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $268K RSUs over 4 years for this DE role. I build petabyte-scale data infrastructure for the world's largest dual marketplace plus robotaxi telemetry pipelines. I have competing DE offers from [Lyft at $292K TC / Google at $305K TC]. Uber's data scale and robotaxi data engineering are unique." Accept at $208K+ base and $242K+ RSUs.
