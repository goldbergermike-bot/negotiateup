### Product Manager | Uber Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Performance Bonus | Mobility & Delivery Platform | Robotaxi Expansion (London/Munich 2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|

**Negotiation DNA**

Uber Product Managers own product strategy for the world's largest mobility and delivery marketplace — rider experience, driver tools, Uber Eats, pricing, or the autonomous vehicle product experience. PMs at Uber manage products used by 150M+ monthly active users across 70+ countries, with the 2026 robotaxi launches in London and Munich adding an entirely new product surface: the autonomous ride experience.

**Level Mapping:** Uber PM = Google L4 PM = Lyft PM = DoorDash PM = Meta IC4 PM

**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026. "As a PM, I define the product experience for a platform that now includes both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The robotaxi product experience — how riders request, ride in, and rate autonomous vehicles — is an entirely new product surface. My product decisions shape how millions of users experience autonomous mobility for the first time."

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual Marketplace Product Strategy:** "I own product strategy for both Mobility and Delivery — 150M+ MAU across dual business lines. Each product decision impacts two revenue streams simultaneously."
2. **Robotaxi Product Experience:** "I define how riders experience autonomous mobility in London and Munich. This is an entirely new product category — I'm inventing the robotaxi user experience at global city scale."
3. **70+ Country Product Complexity:** "My product decisions must work across 70+ regulatory environments, cultural contexts, and payment systems. This global product complexity is unmatched."
4. **Platform Network Effects:** "Uber's two-sided marketplace creates powerful network effects. My product decisions on rider experience directly impact driver supply, and vice versa — product-led growth at its most powerful."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base and $368K RSUs over 4 years for this PM role. I own product strategy for the world's largest dual marketplace — Mobility AND Delivery — plus the robotaxi experience for London and Munich launches. I have competing PM offers from [Lyft at $332K TC / Google at $358K TC]. Uber's dual marketplace and robotaxi product innovation are uniquely compelling." Accept at $228K+ base and $332K+ RSUs.
