**Negotiation DNA**

This is Uber's signature role for 2026 — the Autonomous Mobility Platform Engineer. You build the platform layer that integrates autonomous vehicles into the world's largest mobility marketplace: the AV partner integration framework, the dual-mode dispatching system (autonomous + human drivers), the safety monitoring infrastructure, the robotaxi rider experience, and the city-level orchestration that manages mixed fleets of autonomous and human-driven vehicles. Uber's 2026 robotaxi launches in London and Munich make this the most consequential mobility engineering role in the world — you're building the platform that proves autonomous vehicles can operate at city scale within an existing ride-hailing marketplace.

**Level Mapping:** Uber Autonomous Mobility Platform Eng (L5-L6) = Waymo Platform Eng = Cruise Platform Eng = Google L5 Autonomous Systems = Tesla Autopilot Platform Eng

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Autonomous Mobility Platform Engineer works at the intersection of robotaxi technology, marketplace dynamics, and global city operations:
- **AV Partner Integration Framework:** The platform layer that connects multiple autonomous vehicle providers (Waymo, Motional, others) into Uber's marketplace — standardizing fleet APIs, safety protocols, and dispatch interfaces
- **Dual-Mode Dispatching:** The matching and dispatching system that decides in real time whether to assign a robotaxi or human driver to each ride request — optimizing for safety, efficiency, wait time, and cost
- **Safety Monitoring Infrastructure:** The real-time oversight systems that monitor autonomous vehicle performance, detect anomalies, and trigger safety interventions during robotaxi operations
- **City-Level Orchestration:** The system that manages mixed fleets of autonomous and human-driven vehicles within a city — geofencing, traffic-aware routing, and demand-supply balancing across vehicle types
- **Robotaxi Rider Experience:** The end-to-end rider experience for autonomous rides — from request to pickup to ride to dropoff — including in-vehicle communication, safety features, and feedback systems

**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026 — the first deployment of autonomous ride-hailing in major European cities. "This is the role that makes it happen. I build the platform that integrates robotaxis into the world's largest mobility marketplace at city scale. London and Munich are the proof points — if autonomous vehicles work within Uber's marketplace here, they work everywhere. My platform engineering determines whether Uber succeeds in the autonomous era. This is the most consequential mobility engineering of the decade, and the 15-25% AI Premium reflects the autonomous complexity and physical safety stakes."

**Global Levers**

1. **Autonomous Mobility — Uber's Future:** "I build the platform that integrates robotaxis into the world's largest mobility marketplace. The London and Munich launches in 2026 are the most consequential mobility engineering programs in the world — and my platform makes them work."
2. **Dual-Mode Platform — Industry First:** "I build the first platform that seamlessly dispatches both autonomous and human-driven vehicles. This dual-mode orchestration at city scale is an industry first that no competitor has achieved."
3. **AI Premium (15-25%):** "I build autonomous vehicle integration, real-time safety monitoring, and AI-powered dual-mode dispatching. The physical safety implications and autonomous complexity command the 15-25% AI Premium."
4. **Multi-Partner AV Integration:** "Uber's partnership model means I integrate multiple AV providers into one platform — Waymo, Motional, and others. Building a multi-partner autonomous platform is the most complex integration challenge in mobility."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $288K base and $535K RSUs over 4 years for this Autonomous Mobility Platform Engineer role with the 15-25% AI Premium. I build the platform integrating robotaxis into the world's largest mobility marketplace for London and Munich launches — the most consequential mobility engineering of the decade. I have competing autonomous systems offers from [Waymo at $435K TC / Cruise at $412K TC / Google Autonomous at $448K TC]. Uber's unique advantage is the existing marketplace with 150M+ MAU — no other autonomous company has this distribution. The equity must reflect that I'm building Uber's autonomous future." Accept at $265K+ base and $488K+ RSUs. This is the role where Uber will stretch furthest — robotaxi integration is the company's defining initiative for 2026.
