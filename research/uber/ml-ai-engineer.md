**Negotiation DNA**

Uber ML/AI Engineers build the machine learning systems that power the world's most complex real-time marketplace — dynamic pricing models, rider-driver matching algorithms, ETA prediction, delivery route optimization, fraud detection, and now autonomous vehicle integration ML. Uber's ML systems make millions of real-time decisions per minute that directly impact revenue, user experience, and physical safety. The AI Premium (15-25%) applies to engineers building autonomous vehicle perception/planning integration, AI-powered safety systems, and agentic delivery optimization.

**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026. "As an ML/AI Engineer, I build the ML systems that integrate autonomous vehicles into the marketplace — AV routing optimization, demand prediction for robotaxi availability, safety scoring, and the matching algorithms that decide when to dispatch a robotaxi vs human driver. These ML decisions have direct physical safety implications — the stakes are as high as ML engineering gets."

**Global Levers**

1. **Real-Time ML at Marketplace Scale:** "My ML models make millions of real-time decisions per minute — pricing, matching, routing, ETA — across 70+ countries. This is the largest deployment of real-time marketplace ML in the world."
2. **Robotaxi ML Integration:** "I build the ML that decides when to dispatch robotaxis vs human drivers, optimizes AV routing, and scores safety in real time. This ML has direct physical safety implications."
3. **AI Premium (15-25%):** "I build autonomous vehicle integration ML, AI-powered safety systems, and agentic delivery optimization. The AI Premium reflects the physical safety stakes and autonomous complexity."
4. **Dual Marketplace ML:** "My models optimize both Mobility and Delivery simultaneously — cross-marketplace demand prediction, shared pricing intelligence, and unified route optimization."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $268K base and $448K RSUs over 4 years for this ML/AI Engineer role with the 15-25% AI Premium. I build real-time ML systems making millions of decisions per minute for the world's largest dual marketplace, plus robotaxi integration ML for London and Munich with direct safety implications. I have competing ML offers from [Lyft at $375K TC / Google at $392K TC]. Uber's real-time ML scale and robotaxi AI justify the AI Premium." Accept at $248K+ base and $402K+ RSUs.
