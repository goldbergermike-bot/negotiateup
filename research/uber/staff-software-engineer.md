**Negotiation DNA**

Uber Staff Software Engineers set the technical direction for major platform domains — defining architecture for the matching engine, pricing system, mapping infrastructure, delivery logistics, or the autonomous vehicle integration layer. At this level, you're a force multiplier whose decisions shape how Uber scales across 70+ countries and integrates robotaxis into the world's largest mobility marketplace. Staff-level RSU grants at Uber carry significant value given the company's profitable dual marketplace model. [Source: Uber Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Uber Staff SWE (L5b-L6) = Google L5 SWE = Lyft Staff = DoorDash Staff = Meta E5

**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026. "As a Staff Engineer, I define the technical architecture for Uber's autonomous vehicle integration — the most transformative initiative since Uber's founding. My architecture decisions determine whether robotaxis integrate seamlessly into the world's largest mobility marketplace. This dual-mode platform (autonomous + human) at staff-level scope is the most consequential mobility architecture work in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **Staff Architecture — Platform Direction:** "I set technical direction for major Uber platform domains — matching, pricing, mapping, or AV integration — decisions that shape how the world's largest mobility marketplace evolves."
2. **Robotaxi Architecture Leadership:** "I define the architecture for autonomous vehicle integration. Robotaxi launches in London and Munich require staff-level platform decisions that have never been made before at city scale."
3. **Dual Marketplace Force Multiplier:** "My architecture decisions impact both Mobility and Delivery — 150M+ MAU across dual business lines. Staff-level leverage at this dual-marketplace scale is unique."
4. **Profitable Platform + AV Upside:** "Uber is profitable with massive cash flow from the dual marketplace. Robotaxi integration adds enormous TAM expansion. Staff-level equity captures both current profitability and AV upside."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $322K base and $672K RSUs over 4 years for this Staff SWE role. I set technical direction for major platform domains at the world's largest mobility marketplace — including robotaxi integration architecture for London and Munich. I have competing staff offers from [Google L5 at $480K TC / Lyft at $458K TC]. Uber's dual marketplace, profitability, and robotaxi architecture challenge justify top-tier staff equity." Accept at $295K+ base and $608K+ RSUs.
