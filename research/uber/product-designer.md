**Negotiation DNA**

Uber Product Designers create interfaces used by 150M+ monthly active users across three stakeholder groups: riders, drivers/couriers, and merchants. This tri-sided design challenge is unique — your UX decisions must serve all three marketplace participants simultaneously. The 2026 robotaxi launches add a fourth design surface: the autonomous ride experience, where passengers interact with a vehicle that has no human driver. [Source: Uber Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Robotaxi Expansion — London & Munich 2026**

Uber is launching robotaxi services in London and Munich in 2026. "As a Product Designer, I design the autonomous ride experience — how riders summon, board, ride in, and exit a vehicle with no human driver. This is the most novel UX design challenge in mobility. My interface designs must build trust, communicate safety, and create comfort in an entirely new transportation paradigm."

4. **Safety-Critical Design:** "Mobility design is safety-critical — a confusing interface can put riders at risk. My UX decisions directly impact the physical safety of millions of people."
