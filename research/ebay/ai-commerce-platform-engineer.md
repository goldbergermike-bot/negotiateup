### AI Commerce Platform Engineer | eBay Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Global Marketplace & Payments | $2.5B Share Buyback | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+20–30% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Jose | $218K–$272K | $182K–$322K | 15–20% | $278K–$388K |
| New York | $225K–$278K | $182K–$322K | 15–20% | $285K–$398K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is eBay's signature role for 2026 — the AI Commerce Platform Engineer. You build the AI systems transforming the world's original marketplace: the visual search that lets buyers find products from photos, the AI listing engine that generates optimized descriptions and pricing for sellers, the conversational shopping AI that helps buyers navigate 1.9B+ live listings, the intelligent pricing engine that recommends optimal prices based on market dynamics, and the AI-powered authentication systems that verify luxury goods. eBay's unique challenge — open marketplace with seller-generated listings — makes AI here fundamentally different from curated e-commerce. The 20-30% AI Premium reflects the complexity of applying AI to the most diverse product catalog in the world. [Source: eBay AI Commerce Team 2026]

**Level Mapping:** eBay AI Commerce Platform Eng (IC4) = Google L5 AI Platform = Amazon Personalization ML = Etsy Marketplace AI = Shopify AI Commerce Eng

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The AI Commerce Platform Engineer works at the intersection of marketplace AI, visual commerce, and global-scale ML:
- **Visual Search & Discovery:** AI systems that understand product images — letting buyers search by photo, find similar items, and discover products through visual browsing across 1.9B+ listings
- **AI Listing Engine:** Generative AI that helps sellers create optimal listings — generating descriptions, suggesting pricing, recommending categories, and improving photos to maximize visibility and conversion
- **Conversational Shopping AI:** AI assistants that help buyers navigate eBay's massive catalog through conversation — understanding buyer intent, recommending products, and guiding purchase decisions
- **Intelligent Pricing Engine:** ML systems that analyze market dynamics — completed sales, competitive pricing, demand signals — to recommend optimal prices for sellers and identify value for buyers
- **AI Authentication:** Computer vision systems that verify luxury goods authenticity — handbags, watches, sneakers — protecting buyers and building trust in high-value transactions

**$2.5B Cash Flow Buyback — RSU Density Play**

eBay announced a $2.5B share buyback program — one of the largest in e-commerce — signaling that the stock is trading significantly below its future cash flow value. eBay generates $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow, yet the market undervalues this cash generation. "As the AI Commerce Platform Engineer — eBay's signature AI role — my work is the single most important catalyst for the market re-rating. I want maximum RSU density — $315K+ over 4 years with the 20-30% AI Premium. The $2.5B buyback signals deep undervaluation, and my AI platform is the transformation that changes how the market perceives eBay. Visual search, AI listings, conversational shopping, and intelligent pricing are the features that prove eBay is a modern AI commerce platform — not a legacy auction site. The buyback creates a floor, my AI drives the re-rating, and maximum RSU density captures the full correction. This is the highest-conviction equity play in e-commerce."

**Global Levers**

1. **$2.5B Buyback + Signature AI Premium:** "eBay's $2.5B buyback signals massive undervaluation. As the AI Commerce Platform Engineer, my work IS the re-rating catalyst. $310K+ RSUs with the 20-30% AI Premium. The buyback floor plus AI transformation equals maximum equity upside."
2. **1.9B+ Listing AI Challenge:** "eBay has 1.9B+ live listings from millions of independent sellers — the most diverse product catalog in the world. My AI must understand and organize this diversity. No other AI commerce challenge matches this complexity."
3. **AI Authentication — Trust at Scale:** "My AI authentication systems verify luxury goods across millions of transactions — building the trust that enables high-value commerce. Trust AI directly drives GMV in eBay's highest-value categories."
4. **Market Narrative Transformation:** "I'm the engineer who transforms eBay's market narrative from 'legacy auction site' to 'AI-powered commerce platform.' Visual search, conversational AI, and intelligent pricing are the proof points that change analyst sentiment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $268K base and $318K RSUs over 4 years with the 20-30% AI Premium for this AI Commerce Platform Engineer role — eBay's signature AI position. eBay's $2.5B buyback signals the stock trades far below $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow. My AI platform — visual search, AI listings, conversational shopping, intelligent pricing — is the transformation catalyst for market re-rating. I build AI for 1.9B+ listings — the most complex AI commerce challenge in the world. I have competing offers from [Etsy at $382K TC / Shopify at $392K TC / Amazon at $405K TC]. eBay's cash flow undervaluation and my signature AI role make maximum RSU density the highest-conviction play." Accept at $248K+ base and $285K+ RSUs.
