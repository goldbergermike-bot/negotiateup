**Negotiation DNA**

eBay Software Engineers build the marketplace infrastructure powering the world's original e-commerce platform — 132M+ active buyers, $73B+ in gross merchandise volume, and a marketplace connecting buyers and sellers across 190+ markets globally. Your engineering drives search and discovery, listing management, checkout and payments, seller tools, and the AI-powered recommendation systems that match buyers with inventory. The $2.5B share buyback signals the stock is trading below its future cash flow value — making RSU density the smartest negotiation lever. [Source: eBay SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**$2.5B Cash Flow Buyback — RSU Density Play**

eBay announced a $2.5B share buyback program — one of the largest in e-commerce — signaling that the stock is trading significantly below its future cash flow value. eBay generates $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow, yet the market undervalues this cash generation. "As a Software Engineer, I want maximum RSU density. eBay's $2.5B buyback tells me management believes the stock is deeply undervalued relative to future cash flows. The company generates $2.5B+ in free cash flow annually — more than enough to fund the buyback while investing in growth. Every RSU I receive benefits from the buyback's price support and the market's eventual recognition of eBay's cash flow value. I'm asking for an additional $20K-$32K in RSU grants because the buyback creates a floor, and the cash flow gap to market price means significant upside when the market corrects." Push for RSU-dense packages — eBay's cash flow undervaluation is the best risk-adjusted equity play in e-commerce.

**Global Levers**

1. **$2.5B Buyback — Cash Flow Undervaluation:** "eBay's $2.5B buyback signals the stock trades below future cash flow value. I want RSU density — the buyback creates a price floor while $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow means the market will eventually correct the undervaluation."
2. **132M+ Buyer Global Marketplace:** "I build systems serving 132M+ active buyers across 190+ markets. This global marketplace scale requires engineering that handles multi-currency, multi-language, and cross-border complexity."
3. **Payments Platform Revenue:** "eBay's managed payments platform processes $73B+ in GMV. My engineering on the payments stack directly generates the transaction revenue that funds the buyback."
4. **AI-Powered Commerce Transformation:** "I'm building the AI features transforming eBay — visual search, AI listing creation, intelligent pricing, and personalized recommendations. My engineering drives the modernization that unlocks eBay's next phase of growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $195K base and $138K RSUs over 4 years for this Software Engineer role. eBay's $2.5B buyback signals the stock trades below future cash flow value — I want RSU-dense compensation to capture the upside. I'm building marketplace infrastructure for 132M+ buyers across 190 markets. I have competing offers from [Etsy at $245K TC / Shopify at $248K TC / Amazon at $252K TC]. eBay's cash flow undervaluation and buyback floor make RSUs the best risk-adjusted bet." Accept at $180K+ base and $118K+ RSUs.
