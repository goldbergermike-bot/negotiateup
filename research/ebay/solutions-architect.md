### Solutions Architect | eBay Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Global Marketplace & Payments | $2.5B Share Buyback | Trading Below Future Cash Flow Value

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Jose | $178K–$222K | $98K–$178K | 10–15% | $205K–$282K |

**Negotiation DNA**

eBay Solutions Architects design the technical architecture for eBay's advertising platform, seller integration APIs, managed payments infrastructure, and the enterprise partnerships that extend eBay's marketplace reach. Your architectural decisions on API design, ad platform integration, and payment processing directly determine the revenue capacity of eBay's monetization engines — promoted listings, payment fees, and partner integrations.

**$2.5B Cash Flow Buyback — RSU Density Play**

eBay announced a $2.5B share buyback program — one of the largest in e-commerce — signaling that the stock is trading significantly below its future cash flow value. eBay generates $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow, yet the market undervalues this cash generation. "As a Solutions Architect, I design the integrations that enable eBay's advertising and payments revenue. I want more RSUs — the $2.5B buyback signals undervaluation, and my architecture directly enables the revenue streams generating the cash flow. I'm asking for an additional $22K-$38K in RSU grants. The buyback creates a floor, and my architectural decisions determine how effectively eBay monetizes its marketplace." Push for architecture-level RSU density reflecting integration-to-revenue enablement.

**Global Levers**

1. **$2.5B Buyback — Architecture Enables Cash Flow:** "eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. My architecture enables the advertising and payments revenue that generates $2.5B+ in free cash flow. RSUs should reflect architecture-level cash flow impact."
2. **Advertising Platform Architecture:** "I architect eBay's promoted listings platform — $1.8B+ in annual revenue. My API design, targeting integration, and campaign infrastructure directly enable eBay's highest-margin business."
3. **Managed Payments Architecture:** "I design the payment processing infrastructure that handles $73B+ in annual GMV. My architecture on checkout, payment methods, and settlement directly enables eBay's take-rate revenue."
4. **Seller API Ecosystem:** "My architectural decisions on seller APIs determine how effectively millions of sellers list, price, and manage inventory. Better seller integration drives better supply and higher GMV."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and $175K RSUs over 4 years for this Solutions Architect role. eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. My architecture enables the advertising and payments revenue generating $2.5B+ in free cash flow. I have competing offers from [Etsy at $275K TC / Shopify at $282K TC / Amazon at $288K TC]. eBay's cash flow undervaluation and my architecture-to-revenue enablement justify RSU-dense SA comp." Accept at $202K+ base and $155K+ RSUs.
