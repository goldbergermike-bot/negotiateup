**Negotiation DNA**

eBay Product Managers define the product strategy for the world's original global marketplace — shaping search and discovery, buyer engagement, seller tools, advertising products, and the AI features transforming how 132M+ buyers find inventory across 190+ markets. Your product roadmap determines eBay's GMV growth, buyer retention, and competitive positioning against Amazon, Etsy, and Shopify. [Source: eBay PM Comp 2025-2026]

**$2.5B Cash Flow Buyback — RSU Density Play**

eBay announced a $2.5B share buyback program — one of the largest in e-commerce — signaling that the stock is trading significantly below its future cash flow value. eBay generates $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow, yet the market undervalues this cash generation. "As a Product Manager, my product decisions directly determine eBay's GMV trajectory and market narrative. I want more RSUs — the $2.5B buyback signals deep undervaluation, and my product roadmap on AI commerce, search improvement, and buyer engagement is the strategy that changes the market's perception. I'm asking for an additional $28K-$45K in RSU grants. The buyback creates a floor, and my product strategy drives the growth narrative that corrects the stock." Push for PM-level RSU density reflecting product-driven growth impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$2.5B Buyback — Product Drives Market Narrative:** "eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. My product roadmap on AI commerce and buyer engagement drives the growth narrative that corrects the stock. RSUs should reflect product-level GMV impact."
2. **AI Commerce Product Strategy:** "I define eBay's AI product roadmap — visual search, AI listing creation, intelligent pricing. These products transform eBay's market perception from legacy to innovative. My product strategy is the re-rating catalyst."
3. **Global Marketplace Product Complexity:** "I manage product for 190+ markets — multi-currency, multi-language, cross-border logistics. This global product complexity at $73B+ GMV requires experienced PMs who understand local-global trade-offs."
4. **Advertising Product Revenue:** "I own eBay's advertising product roadmap — promoted listings generating $1.8B+ in revenue. My product decisions on ad formats, targeting, and placement directly generate eBay's highest-margin revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $228K base and $208K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Manager role. eBay's $2.5B buyback signals the stock trades below $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow. My product roadmap on AI commerce, advertising, and buyer engagement drives the growth narrative that corrects the market. I have competing offers from [Etsy at $298K TC / Shopify at $305K TC / Amazon at $312K TC]. eBay's cash flow undervaluation and my product-driven growth impact justify RSU-dense PM comp." Accept at $212K+ base and $185K+ RSUs.
