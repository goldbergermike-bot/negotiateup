**$2.5B Cash Flow Buyback — RSU Density Play**

eBay announced a $2.5B share buyback program — one of the largest in e-commerce — signaling that the stock is trading significantly below its future cash flow value. eBay generates $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow, yet the market undervalues this cash generation. "As an Engineering Manager, I control the team output that drives eBay's GMV and payments revenue. I want equity-heavy comp — $312K+ RSUs over 4 years. The $2.5B buyback signals deep undervaluation, and my team's velocity on search, payments, and AI features directly drives the growth that closes the market gap. The buyback creates a price floor, and my management directly influences the engineering output that proves eBay's cash flow is sustainable and growing." Push for manager-level RSU density reflecting team-level GMV impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$2.5B Buyback — Team-Level RSU Impact:** "eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. My team's output drives the GMV growth that closes the gap. I want $305K+ RSUs — the buyback floor plus my team's growth impact."
2. **Hiring Pipeline for AI Transformation:** "I own the hiring pipeline for eBay's AI engineering teams. Recruiting and retaining top ML talent determines the pace of eBay's AI modernization — the catalyst for market re-rating."
3. **Cross-Functional Revenue Execution:** "I partner with product, design, and data science to ship revenue-critical features. My team's execution on search, payments, and AI drives eBay's quarterly GMV metrics."
4. **Global Engineering Leadership:** "I lead engineering teams serving 190+ markets. Managing the complexity of global payments, multi-language search, and cross-border commerce requires experienced engineering leadership."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $262K base and $315K RSUs over 4 years for this Engineering Manager role. eBay's $2.5B buyback signals the stock trades below $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow. My team's velocity on payments, search, and AI directly drives the GMV growth closing the market gap. I have competing offers from [Etsy at $388K TC / Shopify at $395K TC / Amazon at $402K TC]. eBay's cash flow undervaluation and my team-level revenue impact justify RSU-dense EM comp." Accept at $245K+ base and $282K+ RSUs.
