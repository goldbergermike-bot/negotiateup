**$2.5B Cash Flow Buyback — RSU Density Play**

eBay announced a $2.5B share buyback program — one of the largest in e-commerce — signaling that the stock is trading significantly below its future cash flow value. eBay generates $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow, yet the market undervalues this cash generation. "As a Data Scientist, I optimize the analytics and experimentation that drive eBay's GMV growth. I want more RSUs — the $2.5B buyback signals deep undervaluation, and my data science on search relevance, pricing, and conversion directly drives the metrics that grow revenue. I'm asking for an additional $22K-$35K in RSU grants. The buyback creates a floor, and my analytics drive the data-informed decisions that sustain cash flow generation." Push for data-science-level RSU density reflecting analytics-to-GMV impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$2.5B Buyback — Data Drives Cash Flow:** "eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. My data science on search, pricing, and conversion optimization directly drives the GMV that generates $2.5B+ in free cash flow. RSUs should reflect analytics-to-cash-flow impact."
2. **Global Marketplace Analytics:** "I analyze buyer and seller behavior across 190+ markets — identifying cross-border opportunities, pricing optimization, and category trends. This global analytics complexity is unique to eBay's scale."
3. **Experimentation at Scale:** "I design and analyze A/B tests across 132M+ buyers. My experimentation framework determines which features ship and which don't — directly controlling product quality and GMV impact."
4. **Advertising Intelligence:** "My analytics on ad performance, targeting efficiency, and campaign optimization directly improve eBay's $1.8B+ advertising revenue — the highest-margin business segment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base and $182K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Scientist role. eBay's $2.5B buyback signals the stock trades below cash flow value. My data science on search optimization, pricing, and experimentation drives the GMV that generates $2.5B+ in free cash flow. I have competing offers from [Etsy at $272K TC / Shopify at $278K TC / Amazon at $282K TC]. eBay's cash flow undervaluation and my analytics-to-GMV pipeline justify RSU-dense DS comp." Accept at $198K+ base and $158K+ RSUs.
