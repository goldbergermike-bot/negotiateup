### Senior Software Engineer | eBay Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Global Marketplace & Payments | $2.5B Share Buyback | Trading Below Future Cash Flow Value

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Jose | $198K–$248K | $142K–$255K | 10–15% | $242K–$338K |
| New York | $205K–$255K | $142K–$255K | 10–15% | $248K–$348K |
| Remote US | $188K–$238K | $142K–$255K | 10–15% | $232K–$328K |

**Negotiation DNA**

eBay Senior Software Engineers own the technical architecture of systems powering $73B+ in annual GMV — search ranking algorithms, payments processing, listing management, global shipping infrastructure, and the AI modernization that's transforming the world's original marketplace. At senior level, your architectural decisions directly impact conversion rates, payment reliability, and the seller experience that determines eBay's competitive position. The $2.5B buyback makes RSU-dense packages the optimal play. [Source: eBay Sr SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**$2.5B Cash Flow Buyback — RSU Density Play**

eBay announced a $2.5B share buyback program — one of the largest in e-commerce — signaling that the stock is trading significantly below its future cash flow value. eBay generates $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow, yet the market undervalues this cash generation. "As a Senior Software Engineer making architectural decisions that drive GMV and payments revenue, I want significantly more RSUs. The $2.5B buyback signals deep undervaluation — eBay generates $2.5B+ in free cash flow but trades as if the marketplace is declining. My architectural work on search, payments, and AI modernization is the engineering that proves the market wrong. I'm asking for an additional $35K-$55K in RSU grants over 4 years. The buyback creates a floor, the cash flow is real, and my senior-level architecture drives the growth that unlocks the market's recognition." Push for senior-level RSU density — the cash flow-to-market-cap gap is your equity advantage.

**Global Levers**

1. **$2.5B Buyback — Senior Architecture Impact:** "eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. At senior level, my architecture on search, payments, and AI drives the GMV growth that closes the market gap. I want $245K+ RSUs over 4 years."
2. **$73B+ GMV Architecture Ownership:** "I own the architecture of systems processing $73B+ in annual GMV. Payment reliability, search relevance, and checkout conversion at this scale require senior engineers who make the right trade-offs."
3. **AI Modernization — Market Correction Catalyst:** "My senior engineering on AI search, visual search, and intelligent pricing is the modernization that changes eBay's market narrative. AI transformation is the catalyst for the stock correction."
4. **Global Complexity at Scale:** "I architect systems serving 132M+ buyers across 190+ markets — multi-currency payments, cross-border shipping, localized search. This global engineering complexity demands senior expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $242K base and $248K RSUs over 4 years for this Senior Software Engineer role. eBay's $2.5B buyback signals the stock trades below $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow — I want RSU density to capture the correction. My architectural work on payments, search, and AI modernization drives the GMV growth that closes the market gap. I have competing offers from [Etsy at $332K TC / Shopify at $338K TC / Amazon at $345K TC]. eBay's cash flow undervaluation makes RSUs the best risk-adjusted equity play at senior level." Accept at $225K+ base and $222K+ RSUs.
