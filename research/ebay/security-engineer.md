**Negotiation DNA**

eBay Security Engineers protect a global marketplace processing $73B+ in annual GMV across 190+ markets — securing buyer payment data, seller financial information, managed payments infrastructure, and the platform integrity that prevents fraud and counterfeit goods. Your security work protects eBay's payment processing license, PCI compliance, and the buyer trust that determines whether the marketplace generates the $2.5B+ in free cash flow the market is undervaluing.

**$2.5B Cash Flow Buyback — RSU Density Play**

eBay announced a $2.5B share buyback program — one of the largest in e-commerce — signaling that the stock is trading significantly below its future cash flow value. eBay generates $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow, yet the market undervalues this cash generation. "As a Security Engineer, I protect the $73B+ in GMV and the managed payments infrastructure that generates eBay's free cash flow. I want more RSUs — the $2.5B buyback signals undervaluation, and my security work directly protects the cash flow stream. A major security incident could destroy the payment processing capability that generates $2.5B+ in free cash flow. I'm asking for an additional $25K-$40K in RSU grants because the buyback amplifies my equity, and my work is the insurance that protects eBay's most valuable asset — its cash flow." Push for security-level RSU density reflecting risk-protection impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$2.5B Buyback — Security Protects Cash Flow:** "eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. My security engineering protects the managed payments infrastructure generating $2.5B+ in free cash flow. A breach could destroy the cash flow the buyback is designed to support. RSUs should reflect cash-flow-protection value."
2. **$73B+ GMV Payment Security:** "I protect the managed payments system processing $73B+ in annual GMV. Payment security is the foundation of eBay's take-rate revenue model — my work is the insurance on eBay's revenue."
3. **Global Fraud Prevention:** "I prevent fraud across 190+ markets — cross-border payment fraud, counterfeit listing detection, and account takeover prevention. Global fraud complexity at eBay's scale requires specialized security expertise."
4. **PCI & Regulatory Compliance:** "I ensure PCI-DSS compliance and global payment security regulations across 190+ markets. Payment processing licenses are existential for eBay's business — my compliance work protects the right to process payments."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $232K base and $198K RSUs over 4 years for this Security Engineer role. eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. My security engineering protects the $73B+ in GMV and managed payments generating $2.5B+ in free cash flow. A breach could wipe out market cap. I have competing offers from [Etsy at $298K TC / Shopify at $305K TC / Amazon at $312K TC]. eBay's cash flow undervaluation and my payment-security protection justify RSU-dense security comp." Accept at $215K+ base and $175K+ RSUs.
