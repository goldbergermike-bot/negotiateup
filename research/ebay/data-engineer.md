**$2.5B Cash Flow Buyback — RSU Density Play**

eBay announced a $2.5B share buyback program — one of the largest in e-commerce — signaling that the stock is trading significantly below its future cash flow value. eBay generates $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow, yet the market undervalues this cash generation. "As a Data Engineer, I build the data infrastructure that powers eBay's search ranking, ad targeting, and marketplace analytics. I want more RSUs — the $2.5B buyback signals undervaluation, and my data pipelines directly enable the analytics and ML that drive GMV and advertising revenue. I'm asking for an additional $18K-$30K in RSU grants. The buyback creates a floor, and my data engineering is the foundation of every data-driven decision powering eBay's $2.5B+ in free cash flow." Push for data-level RSU density reflecting infrastructure-to-cash-flow impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$2.5B Buyback — Data Infrastructure Powers Cash Flow:** "eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. My data engineering powers the analytics, ML, and targeting that drive $73B+ in GMV and $2.5B+ in free cash flow. RSUs should reflect data's foundational role."
2. **Global Marketplace Data Complexity:** "I build data pipelines across 190+ markets — multi-currency transactions, multi-language listings, cross-border shipping data. This global data complexity is unique to eBay's scale."
3. **Advertising Data Pipeline:** "My data infrastructure powers eBay's $1.8B+ advertising business — targeting data, campaign analytics, and performance measurement. Ad revenue is eBay's highest-margin business, and my pipelines fuel it."
4. **AI Modernization Data Foundation:** "eBay's AI transformation depends on data quality. My pipelines provide the training data, feature stores, and real-time signals that power visual search, AI listings, and intelligent pricing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $208K base and $158K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Engineer role. eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. My data infrastructure powers the search, advertising, and analytics generating $2.5B+ in free cash flow. I have competing offers from [Etsy at $258K TC / Shopify at $262K TC / Amazon at $268K TC]. eBay's cash flow undervaluation and my data-to-cash-flow pipeline justify RSU-dense DE comp." Accept at $192K+ base and $138K+ RSUs.
