**Negotiation DNA**

eBay TPMs coordinate the cross-functional programs that drive marketplace growth and modernization — payments platform migrations, AI commerce feature rollouts, global infrastructure scaling, holiday readiness programs, and the seller tool launches that improve supply quality. Your program management determines the velocity of eBay's most critical initiatives and how effectively the company executes its transformation roadmap. [Source: eBay TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**$2.5B Cash Flow Buyback — RSU Density Play**

eBay announced a $2.5B share buyback program — one of the largest in e-commerce — signaling that the stock is trading significantly below its future cash flow value. eBay generates $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow, yet the market undervalues this cash generation. "As a TPM, I coordinate the programs that ship eBay's transformation features — AI commerce, payments improvements, and seller tools. I want more RSUs — the $2.5B buyback signals undervaluation, and my program management directly determines how fast eBay executes its transformation. I'm asking for an additional $18K-$28K in RSU grants. The buyback creates a floor, and my program velocity ensures the transformation features ship on time." Push for program-level RSU density reflecting cross-functional execution impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$2.5B Buyback — Program Velocity Drives Transformation:** "eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. My program management determines how fast eBay's AI transformation ships — the catalyst for market re-rating. RSUs should reflect program-level transformation impact."
2. **Global Platform Programs:** "I manage programs across 190+ markets — coordinating multi-region rollouts, localization, and cross-border features. Global program complexity at eBay's scale requires experienced TPMs."
3. **Holiday Readiness Programs:** "I coordinate eBay's holiday readiness — infrastructure scaling, feature freezes, and incident response coordination. Protecting peak-season GMV requires cross-functional program excellence."
4. **AI Modernization Programs:** "I manage the programs that ship eBay's AI features — visual search, AI listings, intelligent pricing. These transformation programs directly change eBay's market narrative."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $205K base and $148K RSUs over 4 years for this TPM role. eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. My program management determines how fast eBay ships its AI transformation — the catalyst for stock re-rating. I have competing offers from [Etsy at $252K TC / Shopify at $258K TC / Amazon at $265K TC]. eBay's cash flow undervaluation and my program-level transformation velocity justify RSU-dense TPM comp." Accept at $192K+ base and $128K+ RSUs.
