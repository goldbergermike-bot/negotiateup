**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Global Marketplace & Payments | $2.5B Share Buyback | Trading Below Future Cash Flow Value | **+15–25% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Jose | $202K–$252K | $152K–$268K | 10–15% | $245K–$342K |

**Negotiation DNA**

eBay ML/AI Engineers build the machine learning systems powering eBay's commerce transformation — visual search, AI-powered listing creation, intelligent pricing, personalized recommendations, fraud detection, and the conversational AI features that modernize the buying experience across 132M+ active buyers and 190+ markets. Your ML models directly determine search relevance, conversion rates, and ad targeting accuracy — the metrics that drive eBay's $73B+ GMV and $2.5B+ free cash flow. The 15-25% AI Premium reflects ML's outsized impact on eBay's modernization narrative. [Source: eBay ML Comp 2025-2026]

**$2.5B Cash Flow Buyback — RSU Density Play**

eBay announced a $2.5B share buyback program — one of the largest in e-commerce — signaling that the stock is trading significantly below its future cash flow value. eBay generates $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow, yet the market undervalues this cash generation. "As an ML/AI Engineer with the 15-25% AI Premium, I build the models that drive eBay's commerce transformation and GMV growth. I want maximum RSU density — $262K+ over 4 years. The $2.5B buyback signals deep undervaluation, and my ML models on visual search, AI listings, and intelligent pricing are the transformation features that change the market's narrative about eBay. The buyback creates a floor, the AI Premium reflects my outsized impact, and my ML work is the catalyst for the stock re-rating. Maximum RSU density captures the triple upside: buyback floor + AI transformation + cash flow correction." Push for ML-premium RSU density — AI engineers are the re-rating catalyst.

**Global Levers**

1. **$2.5B Buyback + AI Premium — Transformation Catalyst:** "eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. With the 15-25% AI Premium, my ML work on visual search and AI listings is the transformation catalyst that triggers the market re-rating. I want $255K+ RSUs."
2. **Visual Search — Commerce Innovation:** "My visual search models let buyers search by image — the most visible AI innovation on eBay. Visual search transforms the buying experience and changes the market narrative from legacy to cutting-edge."
3. **AI Listing Creation — Supply Quality:** "My ML models generate listing descriptions, suggest pricing, and optimize photos — improving supply quality across millions of listings. Better listings drive higher conversion and GMV."
4. **Global ML at Scale:** "I build ML systems serving 132M+ buyers across 190+ markets — multi-language search, cross-border recommendations, and culturally-adapted rankings. Global ML at this scale is rare expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $248K base and $262K RSUs over 4 years with the 15-25% AI Premium for this ML/AI Engineer role. eBay's $2.5B buyback signals the stock trades below $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow. My ML models on visual search, AI listings, and intelligent pricing are the transformation catalyst for the market re-rating. I have competing offers from [Etsy at $335K TC / Shopify at $342K TC / Amazon at $352K TC]. eBay's cash flow undervaluation and my ML-driven transformation justify maximum AI Premium RSU density." Accept at $232K+ base and $238K+ RSUs.
