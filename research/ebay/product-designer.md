### Product Designer | eBay Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Global Marketplace & Payments | $2.5B Share Buyback | Trading Below Future Cash Flow Value

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Jose | $152K–$192K | $68K–$125K | 10–15% | $172K–$238K |

**Negotiation DNA**

eBay Product Designers shape the marketplace experience that 132M+ active buyers interact with across 190+ markets — designing search interfaces, product listings, checkout flows, seller dashboards, and the AI-powered shopping features that modernize the buying experience. Your design decisions directly impact browse-to-purchase conversion, trust signals, and the visual experience that determines whether buyers choose eBay over Amazon or Etsy.

**$2.5B Cash Flow Buyback — RSU Density Play**

eBay announced a $2.5B share buyback program — one of the largest in e-commerce — signaling that the stock is trading significantly below its future cash flow value. eBay generates $2.5B+ in annual free cash flow, yet the market undervalues this cash generation. "As a Product Designer, my UX decisions drive the conversion and engagement metrics that determine eBay's GMV. I want more RSUs — the $2.5B buyback signals undervaluation, and the buyback creates a price floor. My design work on search UX, product listings, and checkout flow directly influences the user experience that drives revenue. I'm asking for an additional $15K-$25K in RSU grants because the cash flow undervaluation means RSUs have significant upside." Push for design-level RSU density reflecting UX-to-conversion impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$2.5B Buyback — Design Drives Perception:** "eBay's $2.5B buyback signals cash flow undervaluation. My design work on the buying experience directly shapes market perception of eBay as modern and trustworthy — RSUs should reflect design's role in the re-rating."
2. **Marketplace Modernization Design:** "I design the modernized eBay experience that changes buyer perception. UX modernization is the single most visible transformation — directly influencing whether users see eBay as innovative or legacy."
3. **Global Design Complexity:** "I design for 132M+ buyers across 190+ markets — adapting UX for different cultures, languages, and shopping behaviors. This global design complexity requires specialized expertise."
4. **Trust & Conversion Design:** "My design decisions on trust signals, seller ratings, and buyer protection directly influence the conversion rate that drives GMV. Trust design is eBay's most important UX challenge."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $188K base and $122K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Designer role. eBay's $2.5B buyback signals the stock trades below cash flow value — I want RSU density to capture the upside. My design modernization directly changes buyer perception and drives conversion. I have competing offers from [Etsy at $235K TC / Shopify at $242K TC / Amazon at $245K TC]. eBay's cash flow undervaluation makes RSUs the best design-level bet." Accept at $175K+ base and $105K+ RSUs.
