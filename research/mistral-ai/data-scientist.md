### Data Scientist | Mistral AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | European AI Champion | Sovereignty Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Paris | €75K-€100K | €100K-€190K | — | €100K-€148K |
| London | £69K-£92K (+5-10% effective vs Paris) | £92K-£175K | — | £92K-£136K |
| Remote EU | €68K-€90K (-5-10% vs Paris) | €100K-€190K | — | €93K-€138K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Mistral AI work at the frontier of LLM evaluation — designing the benchmarks, evaluation frameworks, and performance metrics that determine whether Mistral's models can compete with GPT-4 and Claude. This role spans model evaluation, benchmark optimization, multilingual performance analysis, and the data-driven insights that guide Mistral's research priorities. You are the quantitative backbone of Mistral's model development cycle: your evaluations determine which models ship, which capabilities get prioritized, and how Mistral positions itself in the market. Multilingual evaluation expertise is particularly critical — Mistral's European positioning demands models that excel across French, German, Spanish, Italian, and other EU languages, not just English.

**Level Mapping:** Mistral Data Scientist = Google Data Scientist L3-L4 Paris = Meta FAIR Research Scientist (Data) = DeepMind Research Analyst. Google Data Scientist Paris total comp ranges €95K-€160K. LLM evaluation specialists command a 15-20% premium over general data science roles.

**European AI Sovereignty Script**
"Mistral AI is Europe's only frontier AI lab — the company that ensures European AI sovereignty in a world dominated by US and Chinese AI. I'm not just a Data Scientist; I'm Critical Sovereignty Talent. As the EU AI Act reshapes global AI regulation, Mistral is positioned as the compliant-by-design alternative to US labs. European candidates should demand US-style total compensation: 'I could work at OpenAI or Anthropic in San Francisco for $200K-$280K total comp as a Data Scientist. Mistral's sovereignty mission is compelling, but European AI talent is scarce and my compensation must reflect that I'm choosing to keep frontier AI expertise in Europe. US-parity TC — adjusted for Paris/London cost of living — is the floor.' The sovereignty premium means Mistral will stretch on comp to retain European AI talent that would otherwise emigrate to US labs."

**Global Levers**
1. **LLM Evaluation Expertise Premium:** "LLM evaluation is a specialized discipline — not general data science. I bring experience designing benchmark suites, evaluating model safety, and quantifying capability improvements. This LLM-specific expertise should push my base to €95K+ and equity to €170K+, reflecting the scarcity of people who can rigorously evaluate frontier models."
2. **Multilingual Benchmark Ownership:** "Mistral's competitive differentiation is multilingual performance — models that excel in French, German, and other EU languages. I own the evaluation frameworks that prove this differentiation. My comp should reflect that without rigorous multilingual benchmarking, Mistral's sovereignty narrative is unsubstantiated marketing."
3. **Research Publication Rights:** "My evaluation work generates publishable insights. I want explicit rights to publish at top venues (NeurIPS, ICML, EMNLP) with a €5K-€8K annual conference budget. Publication rights are a career development lever that partially compensates for the liquidity gap vs. Big Tech RSUs."
4. **Data Infrastructure Budget:** "Rigorous model evaluation requires significant compute and data resources. I need a committed budget for evaluation infrastructure — GPU access for running benchmarks, access to proprietary evaluation datasets, and tooling budget. Resource commitments are a form of compensation because they directly affect my ability to do impactful work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I have a Google Paris Data Scientist offer at €92K base + €130K RSUs/4yr, and interest from Anthropic's evaluation team at $170K base in San Francisco. For Mistral, I need €95K base, €170K in pre-IPO equity over four years, and a €12K signing bonus. My accept-at floor is €130K total comp annually. My multilingual LLM evaluation expertise is directly aligned with Mistral's sovereignty positioning — but the comp must reflect that I'm choosing Paris over San Francisco and pre-IPO equity over liquid RSUs."
