**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Mistral AI shape the strategy for Europe's most consequential AI products — from La Plateforme's commercial API that competes with OpenAI's API and Anthropic's Claude API, to the open-weight model release strategy that gives Mistral its unique community moat, to Le Chat, Mistral's consumer-facing conversational AI. This PM role sits at the intersection of LLM product strategy, open-source community dynamics, and EU regulatory navigation. You are defining how European AI goes to market — choosing which capabilities to open-weight vs. commercialize, how to price API access, and how to position Mistral as the EU AI Act-compliant alternative. Pre-IPO equity at Mistral gives PMs direct financial alignment with the product decisions they make.

**Level Mapping:** Mistral PM = Google L4-L5 PM Paris = DeepMind PM = Meta PM (IC5) = Anthropic PM. Google PM Paris total comp ranges €120K-€200K; Paris-based AI product roles are among the scarcest in European tech.

**European AI Sovereignty Script**
"Mistral AI is Europe's only frontier AI lab — the company that ensures European AI sovereignty in a world dominated by US and Chinese AI. I'm not just a Product Manager; I'm Critical Sovereignty Talent. As the EU AI Act reshapes global AI regulation, Mistral is positioned as the compliant-by-design alternative to US labs. European candidates should demand US-style total compensation: 'I could work at OpenAI or Anthropic in San Francisco for $250K-$350K total comp as a Product Manager. Mistral's sovereignty mission is compelling, but European AI talent is scarce and my compensation must reflect that I'm choosing to keep frontier AI expertise in Europe. US-parity TC — adjusted for Paris/London cost of living — is the floor.' The sovereignty premium means Mistral will stretch on comp to retain European AI talent that would otherwise emigrate to US labs."

**Global Levers**
1. **Commercial Impact Equity:** "As PM, my decisions directly drive La Plateforme's revenue — pricing, packaging, API feature prioritization. My equity should reflect this P&L impact: €200K+ over four years. Every percentage point of market share I capture from OpenAI's API translates directly to Mistral's valuation."
2. **Open-Weight Strategy Ownership:** "Mistral's open-weight model releases are its most powerful community and competitive asset. I want explicit ownership of the open-weight release strategy — timing, model selection, licensing — and compensation that reflects this strategically unique responsibility that has no equivalent at closed-source US labs."
3. **Base Aligned with Paris AI PM Market:** "AI Product Managers in Paris with LLM experience are extraordinarily rare. Google and Meta Paris PM bases are €95K-€120K. Mistral's base should be €100K+ to reflect the scarcity premium — there are fewer than 50 people in Europe with the combination of LLM product experience and regulatory fluency this role requires."
4. **EU AI Act Regulatory Expertise Premium:** "I bring specific expertise in EU AI Act compliance product strategy — understanding how to build products that are compliant-by-design. This regulatory fluency is a competitive moat for Mistral vs. US labs. It should be recognized with a €5K-€10K expertise premium on base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm evaluating Mistral alongside a Google Paris PM role at €105K base + €180K RSUs/4yr, and an OpenAI product role offering $180K base + equity in San Francisco. For Mistral, I need €105K base, €200K in pre-IPO equity over four years, and a €15K signing bonus. My accept-at floor is €145K total comp annually. Mistral's PM role is uniquely compelling — I'd be shaping the go-to-market for European AI sovereignty — but the comp must reflect the career risk of leaving a liquid Big Tech PM track."
