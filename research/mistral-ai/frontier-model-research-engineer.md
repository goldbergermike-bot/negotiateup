### Frontier Model Research Engineer | Mistral AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | European AI Champion | Sovereignty Premium | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+25-40% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Paris | €115K-€155K | €300K-€550K | — | €190K-€293K |
| London | £106K-£143K (+5-10% effective vs Paris) | £277K-£507K | — | £175K-£270K |
| Remote EU | €104K-€140K (-5-10% vs Paris) | €300K-€550K | — | €179K-€277K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The Frontier Model Research Engineer is Mistral AI's signature role — the researchers and engineers building Europe's most advanced AI models. You are directly responsible for training Mistral's next-generation LLMs, designing mixture-of-experts architectures that define Mistral's technical moat, developing multilingual foundation models that outperform US labs on European languages, and pushing the frontier of training at scale. This role is where Mistral's European AI sovereignty mission lives: every model you train is evidence that frontier AI can be built in Europe, not just imported from Silicon Valley. The +25-40% Agentic AI Premium reflects both the scarcity of frontier model researchers globally and the strategic importance of agentic capabilities in Mistral's product roadmap. Pre-IPO equity at this level is Mistral's most powerful lever — grants of €300K-€550K at a $6B+ valuation represent life-changing wealth creation if Mistral reaches a $20B+ public valuation. You are among the 200-300 people on the planet capable of training frontier LLMs — negotiate like it.

**Level Mapping:** Mistral Frontier Model Research Engineer = Google Brain/DeepMind Research Scientist L5-L6 = Meta FAIR Research Scientist = OpenAI Research Engineer = Anthropic Research Scientist. Google Research Scientist L5-L6 Paris total comp ranges €250K-€400K+; DeepMind Research Scientist London ranges £220K-£380K+; OpenAI Research Engineer SF ranges $350K-$600K+. Mistral must match the upper bound of European ranges and offer equity upside that competes with US lab liquid comp.

**European AI Sovereignty Script**
"Mistral AI is Europe's only frontier AI lab — the company that ensures European AI sovereignty in a world dominated by US and Chinese AI. I'm not just a Frontier Model Research Engineer; I'm Critical Sovereignty Talent. As the EU AI Act reshapes global AI regulation, Mistral is positioned as the compliant-by-design alternative to US labs. European candidates should demand US-style total compensation: 'I could work at OpenAI or Anthropic in San Francisco for $450K-$650K total comp as a frontier model researcher. Mistral's sovereignty mission is compelling, but European AI talent is scarce and my compensation must reflect that I'm choosing to keep frontier AI expertise in Europe. US-parity TC — adjusted for Paris/London cost of living — is the floor.' The sovereignty premium means Mistral will stretch on comp to retain European AI talent that would otherwise emigrate to US labs."

**Global Levers**
1. **Frontier Researcher Scarcity Premium:** "There are 200-300 people globally who can train frontier LLMs — and perhaps 30-50 in Europe. I am one of them. My compensation must reflect this extreme scarcity: €150K+ base and €500K+ equity over four years. If Mistral loses me to OpenAI or Anthropic, it's not just losing an employee — it's losing a meaningful fraction of Europe's frontier AI research capacity. The cost of replacing me is effectively infinite because the talent pool doesn't exist."
2. **Agentic AI + MoE Architecture Dual Premium:** "I bring the rare combination of frontier model training experience AND agentic AI systems expertise. Mistral's next-generation models need both: MoE architectures for efficient scaling and agentic capabilities for product differentiation. This dual expertise justifies the full +25-40% Agentic AI Premium on top of already-premium frontier researcher comp. My equity should be at the absolute top of band — €500K+."
3. **Anti-Dilution & Liquidity Protections:** "At this equity level (€500K+ over four years), I need contractual protections: anti-dilution clauses ensuring my percentage ownership is maintained through future funding rounds, and a secondary sale provision allowing me to sell a portion of vested shares after 18-24 months. Without liquidity protections, I'm comparing Mistral's illiquid equity against OpenAI's $500K+ liquid RSU packages."
4. **Research Autonomy & Publication Rights:** "I need guaranteed research autonomy — the ability to pursue research directions I believe will advance Mistral's capabilities, with at least 20% of my time for exploratory research. Full publication rights at NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, and ACL are non-negotiable. A €15K-€20K annual research and conference budget, plus priority access to Mistral's largest GPU clusters, are baseline requirements. Research freedom is a form of compensation for frontier researchers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I have a final offer from OpenAI at $220K base + $400K RSUs/4yr in San Francisco, and DeepMind is offering £160K base + £350K RSUs in London. For Mistral, I need the full package: €150K base, €500K in pre-IPO equity over four years with anti-dilution and secondary sale provisions, a €40K signing bonus, a €20K annual research budget, guaranteed publication rights, and 20% research time. My accept-at floor is €270K total comp annually with structural protections on equity. I believe deeply in Mistral's mission to build frontier AI in Europe — this is the work I want to do. But I am one of a handful of people in Europe who can train the next Mistral Large, and my compensation must reflect that strategic reality. If the comp doesn't work, I will move to San Francisco — and Mistral will have lost another frontier researcher to the US talent drain that its entire mission exists to prevent."
