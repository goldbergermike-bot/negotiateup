### Senior Software Engineer | Mistral AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | European AI Champion | Sovereignty Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Paris | €85K-€115K | €150K-€275K | — | €122K-€184K |
| London | £79K-£106K (+5-10% effective vs Paris) | £138K-£253K | — | £113K-£170K |
| Remote EU | €77K-€104K (-5-10% vs Paris) | €150K-€275K | — | €114K-€173K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Mistral AI own critical systems end-to-end — from the distributed training infrastructure that produces Mistral's frontier models to the inference serving stack powering La Plateforme's commercial API. At this level, you are expected to make architectural decisions that directly impact model quality, serving latency, and Mistral's competitive position against OpenAI and Anthropic. The pre-IPO equity grant at Senior is where Mistral's compensation becomes genuinely competitive with US labs on a risk-adjusted basis, especially given the $6B+ valuation and clear IPO trajectory. European sovereignty framing is your strongest lever: Mistral cannot afford to lose senior-level talent to US labs.

**Level Mapping:** Mistral Senior SWE = Google L4 Paris = DeepMind Senior SWE = Meta FAIR Senior SWE = Anthropic Senior (L4). Google L4 Paris total comp ranges €130K-€190K; DeepMind Senior in London ranges £120K-£180K. Mistral's equity upside is designed to match or exceed these on a 3-5 year horizon.

**European AI Sovereignty Script**
"Mistral AI is Europe's only frontier AI lab — the company that ensures European AI sovereignty in a world dominated by US and Chinese AI. I'm not just a Senior Software Engineer; I'm Critical Sovereignty Talent. As the EU AI Act reshapes global AI regulation, Mistral is positioned as the compliant-by-design alternative to US labs. European candidates should demand US-style total compensation: 'I could work at OpenAI or Anthropic in San Francisco for $250K-$350K total comp at senior level. Mistral's sovereignty mission is compelling, but European AI talent is scarce and my compensation must reflect that I'm choosing to keep frontier AI expertise in Europe. US-parity TC — adjusted for Paris/London cost of living — is the floor.' The sovereignty premium means Mistral will stretch on comp to retain European AI talent that would otherwise emigrate to US labs."

**Global Levers**
1. **Equity Band Maximization:** "At senior level, I'm directly impacting Mistral's model quality and competitive position. I'd like the equity grant to reflect top-of-band — €250K+ over four years — given my direct experience with distributed training systems and LLM inference at scale. This is where Mistral's comp becomes competitive with Google Paris RSUs."
2. **Base Parity with Paris Big Tech:** "Google L4 base in Paris is €100K-€120K. Mistral's base should be at parity — €110K+ — because the sovereignty premium means I'm choosing Mistral over a guaranteed Google paycheck. The pre-IPO risk I'm taking should be compensated through equity, not subsidized through a below-market base."
3. **Equity Refresh & Promotion Path:** "I want clarity on equity refresh cadence — annual grants that ensure my equity doesn't dilute as Mistral raises additional rounds. Additionally, what's the timeline and criteria for Staff promotion? At Google Paris, L4-to-L5 takes 2-3 years; I'd expect a similar or faster path at Mistral given the pace of growth."
4. **Relocation & Housing Support:** "If relocating to Paris, I need a relocation package of €15K-€25K covering moving costs, temporary housing, and visa/administrative support. US labs offer $50K+ relocation to San Francisco — Mistral's Paris relocation should be proportionally competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I have a final-round offer from DeepMind London at £145K base + £180K RSUs/4yr, and I'm in late stages with Anthropic's London office. For Mistral, I'd need €110K base, €250K in pre-IPO equity over four years, and a €20K signing bonus to offset the liquidity gap. My accept-at floor is €165K total comp annually — below that, the rational choice is DeepMind's liquid RSUs. I believe in Mistral's sovereignty mission, but my compensation must reflect that I'm Critical Sovereignty Talent choosing Europe over San Francisco."
