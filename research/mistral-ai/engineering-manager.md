**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Mistral AI lead the teams building Europe's frontier AI infrastructure — from model training teams producing the next Mixtral to platform teams scaling La Plateforme's commercial API. This is a uniquely high-impact EM role: you're managing 6-12 of the most talented AI engineers in Europe, setting technical priorities that directly affect Mistral's competitive position against OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. The EM role at Mistral carries both people leadership and deep technical context — Mistral expects EMs who can review model architecture decisions, not just manage sprints. Pre-IPO equity at the EM level is substantial and reflects your leverage over team retention and output.

**Level Mapping:** Mistral EM = Google L5 EM Paris = DeepMind Engineering Manager = Meta FAIR EM = Anthropic EM. Google L5 EM Paris total comp ranges €180K-€260K; DeepMind EM London ranges £160K-£240K. Mistral EM comp should target the midpoint of these ranges with meaningful equity upside.

**European AI Sovereignty Script**
"Mistral AI is Europe's only frontier AI lab — the company that ensures European AI sovereignty in a world dominated by US and Chinese AI. I'm not just an Engineering Manager; I'm Critical Sovereignty Talent. As the EU AI Act reshapes global AI regulation, Mistral is positioned as the compliant-by-design alternative to US labs. European candidates should demand US-style total compensation: 'I could work at OpenAI or Anthropic in San Francisco for $350K-$450K total comp as an Engineering Manager. Mistral's sovereignty mission is compelling, but European AI talent is scarce and my compensation must reflect that I'm choosing to keep frontier AI expertise in Europe. US-parity TC — adjusted for Paris/London cost of living — is the floor.' The sovereignty premium means Mistral will stretch on comp to retain European AI talent that would otherwise emigrate to US labs."

**Global Levers**
1. **Team-Building Equity Premium:** "As EM, I'm directly responsible for hiring and retaining the engineering talent that builds Mistral's models. My equity should reflect this leverage — €320K+ over four years. If my team's attrition increases because I leave, the cost to Mistral far exceeds the marginal equity investment in my package."
2. **Management Scope & Headcount Commitment:** "I want a defined team scope — ownership of [specific team/domain] — and a committed headcount plan. At Google, L5 EMs have 6-12 directs with clear growth trajectories. I need assurance that Mistral will invest in growing my team, not just maintaining it. Headcount commitment is a compensation lever — more scope justifies higher comp."
3. **Base Parity with Paris Big Tech EMs:** "Google L5 EM base in Paris is €115K-€140K. Mistral's EM base should be €120K+ to reflect that I'm taking pre-IPO risk while managing a team through hypergrowth — which is significantly harder than managing at an established company."
4. **Leadership Development & Executive Exposure:** "At a company of Mistral's scale, EMs should have direct access to founders (Arthur Mensch, Guillaume Lample, Timothee Lacroix) and influence on company-level technical strategy. I want a commitment to regular leadership syncs and a path to Director-level scope within 18-24 months as the organization grows."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I have a Google L5 EM offer in Paris at €130K base + €200K RSUs/4yr, and I'm in final stages with DeepMind London. For Mistral, I need €125K base, €330K in pre-IPO equity over four years, a €20K signing bonus, and a defined headcount plan of 8+ engineers. My accept-at floor is €200K total comp annually. The EM role at Mistral is uniquely impactful — but the compensation must reflect that I'm choosing pre-IPO risk and hypergrowth management complexity over a stable Big Tech EM position."
