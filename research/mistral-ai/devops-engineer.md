### DevOps Engineer | Mistral AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | European AI Champion | Sovereignty Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Paris | €72K-€98K | €90K-€175K | — | €95K-€142K |
| London | £66K-£90K (+5-10% effective vs Paris) | £83K-£161K | — | £88K-£131K |
| Remote EU | €65K-€88K (-5-10% vs Paris) | €90K-€175K | — | €88K-€132K |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Mistral AI manage the GPU infrastructure, model serving pipelines, and European data center operations that power Europe's only frontier AI lab. This is not standard DevOps — you are orchestrating thousands of GPUs for model training, optimizing inference serving latency for La Plateforme's commercial API, and ensuring data sovereignty compliance across European data centers. Mistral's infrastructure must be European-hosted to maintain its sovereignty narrative, which means you are building and operating infrastructure that cannot simply be offloaded to US cloud providers. The operational complexity of running frontier AI training at European scale, combined with data sovereignty requirements, makes this among the most demanding DevOps roles in European tech.

**Level Mapping:** Mistral DevOps = Google SRE/DevOps L3-L4 Paris = Meta Production Engineer = DeepMind Infrastructure Engineer. Google SRE Paris total comp ranges €90K-€155K. AI-specific DevOps/infrastructure roles command a 10-20% premium due to GPU orchestration complexity.

**European AI Sovereignty Script**
"Mistral AI is Europe's only frontier AI lab — the company that ensures European AI sovereignty in a world dominated by US and Chinese AI. I'm not just a DevOps Engineer; I'm Critical Sovereignty Talent. As the EU AI Act reshapes global AI regulation, Mistral is positioned as the compliant-by-design alternative to US labs. European candidates should demand US-style total compensation: 'I could work at OpenAI or Anthropic in San Francisco for $200K-$270K total comp as a DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer. Mistral's sovereignty mission is compelling, but European AI talent is scarce and my compensation must reflect that I'm choosing to keep frontier AI expertise in Europe. US-parity TC — adjusted for Paris/London cost of living — is the floor.' The sovereignty premium means Mistral will stretch on comp to retain European AI talent that would otherwise emigrate to US labs."

**Global Levers**
1. **GPU Infrastructure Expertise Premium:** "I manage the GPU clusters that train Mistral's frontier models — thousands of A100/H100 GPUs running distributed training jobs worth millions in compute. This isn't standard DevOps; it's AI infrastructure engineering. My base should be €90K+ and equity €155K+ to reflect the specialized nature of GPU orchestration at frontier scale."
2. **European Data Sovereignty Operations:** "Mistral's European data center strategy is a core business requirement, not a nice-to-have. I'm building and operating infrastructure that ensures Mistral can credibly claim European data sovereignty — a regulatory and competitive imperative. This operational burden deserves a sovereignty operations premium of €5K-€8K on base."
3. **On-Call & Operational Complexity Compensation:** "Frontier model training runs are multi-million-euro compute jobs that require 24/7 operational support. I need explicit on-call compensation — either a €5K-€10K annual on-call stipend or additional equity — to reflect the operational responsibility of keeping Mistral's training infrastructure running."
4. **Certifications & Training Budget:** "AI infrastructure is evolving rapidly — NVIDIA CUDA optimization, Kubernetes GPU scheduling, distributed training frameworks. I need a €5K-€8K annual training and certification budget to stay current with the infrastructure stack that Mistral depends on."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I have an offer from Google Cloud Paris SRE at €88K base + €120K RSUs/4yr, and interest from a US AI infrastructure startup offering $160K base remote. For Mistral, I need €92K base, €155K in pre-IPO equity over four years, a €12K signing bonus, and a €5K annual on-call stipend. My accept-at floor is €125K total comp annually. Mistral's European AI infrastructure is a sovereignty-critical asset — and I'm one of the few people in Europe with the GPU orchestration experience to operate it at frontier scale."
