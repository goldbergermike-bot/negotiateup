### Technical Program Manager | Mistral AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | European AI Champion | Sovereignty Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Paris | €70K-€95K | €80K-€155K | — | €90K-€134K |
| London | £65K-£88K (+5-10% effective vs Paris) | £74K-£143K | — | £83K-£124K |
| Remote EU | €63K-€86K (-5-10% vs Paris) | €80K-€155K | — | €83K-€125K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Mistral AI coordinate the most complex programs in European AI — from frontier model release cycles that span research, engineering, safety evaluation, and legal review, to the dual-track management of open-weight community releases and commercial La Plateforme deployments. Every Mistral model release is a multi-stakeholder program involving researchers, engineers, product managers, legal counsel (for EU AI Act compliance), and communications teams. You are the connective tissue that ensures Mistral ships models on schedule without compromising quality, safety, or regulatory compliance. The complexity of managing open-weight + commercial parallel tracks — with different release criteria, licensing considerations, and stakeholder expectations — makes this TPM role uniquely demanding.

**Level Mapping:** Mistral TPM = Google TPM L4 Paris = Meta TPM IC5 = DeepMind Program Manager = Anthropic TPM. Google TPM Paris total comp ranges €100K-€155K. AI model release coordination experience commands a 10-15% premium over general TPM roles.

**European AI Sovereignty Script**
"Mistral AI is Europe's only frontier AI lab — the company that ensures European AI sovereignty in a world dominated by US and Chinese AI. I'm not just a Technical Program Manager; I'm Critical Sovereignty Talent. As the EU AI Act reshapes global AI regulation, Mistral is positioned as the compliant-by-design alternative to US labs. European candidates should demand US-style total compensation: 'I could work at OpenAI or Anthropic in San Francisco for $200K-$270K total comp as a TPM. Mistral's sovereignty mission is compelling, but European AI talent is scarce and my compensation must reflect that I'm choosing to keep frontier AI expertise in Europe. US-parity TC — adjusted for Paris/London cost of living — is the floor.' The sovereignty premium means Mistral will stretch on comp to retain European AI talent that would otherwise emigrate to US labs."

**Global Levers**
1. **Model Release Complexity Premium:** "I'm coordinating Mistral's model release programs — each involving research, engineering, safety, legal, and comms workstreams across open-weight and commercial tracks simultaneously. This dual-track release management is unique to Mistral and significantly more complex than standard software TPM work. My base should be €88K+ and equity €140K+."
2. **Open-Weight + Commercial Track Management:** "Managing parallel open-weight and commercial release tracks requires navigating competing stakeholder interests — the open-source community wants maximum openness, the commercial team wants differentiation, legal wants compliance. I bring specific experience managing this tension and my comp should reflect this strategically critical program management capability."
3. **EU AI Act Compliance Program Ownership:** "Every model release must be EU AI Act compliant — documentation, risk assessment, transparency requirements. I want ownership of the compliance program management function, with a clear mandate and budget. This regulatory program management expertise is a €5K-€8K premium above standard TPM comp."
4. **Cross-Functional Visibility & Career Path:** "TPMs at Mistral have unique cross-functional visibility — from research to commercial. I want a defined career path to Senior TPM / Head of Program Management, with scope that grows as Mistral's program complexity increases. Explicit career progression commitments partially compensate for pre-IPO liquidity risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I have a Google TPM offer in Paris at €90K base + €120K RSUs/4yr, and interest from Anthropic's program management team. For Mistral, I need €90K base, €140K in pre-IPO equity over four years, and a €10K signing bonus. My accept-at floor is €118K total comp annually. Mistral's model release cadence is accelerating — you need a TPM who can manage the complexity of dual-track releases under EU regulatory scrutiny. That's exactly my expertise, and it should be compensated at the top of band."
