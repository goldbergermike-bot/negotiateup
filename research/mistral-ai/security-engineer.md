**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Mistral AI protect the most sensitive AI systems in Europe — from the model weights that represent billions in R&D investment, to the training data pipelines that must maintain GDPR compliance, to La Plateforme's commercial API infrastructure serving enterprise customers with strict security requirements. This is AI security at the frontier: you are defending against model extraction attacks, ensuring training data provenance and sovereignty, implementing EU AI Act security requirements, and building the security architecture that allows European enterprises to trust Mistral with their most sensitive data. The intersection of model security, data sovereignty, and EU regulatory compliance makes this among the most complex security engineering roles in European tech.

**Level Mapping:** Mistral Security Engineer = Google Security Engineer L4 Paris = Meta Security Engineer = DeepMind Security Engineer = Anthropic Security (Trust & Safety adjacent). Google Security Engineer Paris total comp ranges €105K-€170K. AI model security and EU regulatory compliance specialization commands a 15-20% premium.

**European AI Sovereignty Script**
"Mistral AI is Europe's only frontier AI lab — the company that ensures European AI sovereignty in a world dominated by US and Chinese AI. I'm not just a Security Engineer; I'm Critical Sovereignty Talent. As the EU AI Act reshapes global AI regulation, Mistral is positioned as the compliant-by-design alternative to US labs. European candidates should demand US-style total compensation: 'I could work at OpenAI or Anthropic in San Francisco for $220K-$300K total comp as a Security Engineer. Mistral's sovereignty mission is compelling, but European AI talent is scarce and my compensation must reflect that I'm choosing to keep frontier AI expertise in Europe. US-parity TC — adjusted for Paris/London cost of living — is the floor.' The sovereignty premium means Mistral will stretch on comp to retain European AI talent that would otherwise emigrate to US labs."

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Model Security Specialization Premium:** "I'm not doing standard application security — I'm protecting frontier AI model weights worth billions in R&D, defending against state-level model extraction attempts, and implementing novel AI-specific security controls. This AI security specialization justifies €100K+ base and €175K+ equity, well above standard security engineer comp."
2. **EU Regulatory Security Compliance (GDPR + EU AI Act):** "Mistral's security posture directly enables its compliance narrative — EU AI Act security requirements, GDPR data protection, and the data sovereignty architecture that enterprise customers demand. I own the security framework that makes Mistral's 'compliant-by-design' positioning credible. This regulatory security ownership is a €8K-€12K premium."
3. **Data Sovereignty Architecture Ownership:** "I design and implement the data sovereignty controls that ensure Mistral's training data and customer data remain within European jurisdictions. This is a core business requirement, not a nice-to-have. My architecture decisions directly affect whether Mistral can serve regulated European enterprises — banks, healthcare, government."
4. **Security Tooling & Bug Bounty Budget:** "I need a committed budget for security tooling, penetration testing, and eventually a bug bounty program. A €20K-€30K annual security tooling budget and authority to build a security program from the ground up is a meaningful professional development lever."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I have a Google Security Engineer offer in Paris at €98K base + €140K RSUs/4yr, and interest from Anthropic's security team. For Mistral, I need €100K base, €175K in pre-IPO equity over four years, and a €15K signing bonus. My accept-at floor is €138K total comp annually. AI security engineers with EU regulatory compliance expertise are among the scarcest talent in European tech — there are perhaps 20-30 people on the continent with this exact skillset. Mistral's sovereignty narrative is only credible if its security is bulletproof, and I'm the person who ensures that."
