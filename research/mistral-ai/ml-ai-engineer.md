### ML/AI Engineer | Mistral AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | European AI Champion | Sovereignty Premium | **+20-35% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Paris | €95K-€130K | €200K-€375K | — | €145K-€224K |
| London | £88K-£120K (+5-10% effective vs Paris) | £184K-£345K | — | £134K-£206K |
| Remote EU | €86K-€117K (-5-10% vs Paris) | €200K-€375K | — | €136K-€211K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Mistral AI are hands-on builders of frontier AI systems — responsible for model training, inference optimization, and the mixture-of-experts architectures that define Mistral's technical differentiation. This role sits between research and production: you implement the training runs that produce Mistral's next-generation models, optimize inference to make La Plateforme commercially viable at scale, and build the agentic AI systems that represent Mistral's next major product surface. The +20-35% Agentic AI Premium reflects the explosive demand for engineers who can build autonomous AI agents — Mistral's agentic capabilities are a critical competitive frontier against OpenAI and Anthropic. Pre-IPO equity at this level is substantial and reflects your direct impact on Mistral's core product.

**Level Mapping:** Mistral ML/AI Engineer = Google ML Engineer L4-L5 Paris = Meta FAIR Research Engineer = DeepMind Research Engineer = Anthropic ML Engineer. Google ML Engineer L5 Paris total comp ranges €180K-€280K; Meta FAIR Research Engineer ranges €160K-€250K. The Agentic AI Premium pushes Mistral ML/AI engineer comp to the top of European ranges.

**European AI Sovereignty Script**
"Mistral AI is Europe's only frontier AI lab — the company that ensures European AI sovereignty in a world dominated by US and Chinese AI. I'm not just an ML/AI Engineer; I'm Critical Sovereignty Talent. As the EU AI Act reshapes global AI regulation, Mistral is positioned as the compliant-by-design alternative to US labs. European candidates should demand US-style total compensation: 'I could work at OpenAI or Anthropic in San Francisco for $350K-$500K total comp as an ML Engineer. Mistral's sovereignty mission is compelling, but European AI talent is scarce and my compensation must reflect that I'm choosing to keep frontier AI expertise in Europe. US-parity TC — adjusted for Paris/London cost of living — is the floor.' The sovereignty premium means Mistral will stretch on comp to retain European AI talent that would otherwise emigrate to US labs."

**Global Levers**
1. **Agentic AI Premium Negotiation:** "Agentic AI engineering is the highest-demand ML specialization in 2026. I bring specific experience building autonomous AI agents — tool use, planning, multi-step reasoning systems. This Agentic AI expertise commands a 20-35% premium above standard ML engineer comp, pushing my target to €125K+ base and €340K+ equity. Every US lab is recruiting aggressively for this skillset."
2. **Mixture-of-Experts Training Experience:** "Mistral's MoE architecture (Mixtral) is its core technical differentiation. I bring direct experience with sparse mixture-of-experts training — routing strategies, expert specialization, and inference optimization for MoE models. This is among the rarest ML engineering skillsets in the world and should push my equity to the top of band (€350K+)."
3. **Base Floor at FAIR/DeepMind Parity:** "Meta FAIR and DeepMind are actively recruiting ML engineers in Paris and London at €110K-€140K base. Mistral's ML/AI engineer base must be at parity — €120K+ — because at this level, my direct alternatives are liquid Big Tech comp with no pre-IPO risk. The equity should be additive upside, not a substitute for competitive base."
4. **GPU Compute Access & Research Time:** "I need guaranteed access to Mistral's GPU cluster for personal research and experimentation — at least 10-15% of my time allocated to exploratory work. Additionally, publication rights at NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR are essential. Compute access and publication rights are compensation in kind that partially offset the liquidity gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I have a competing offer from Meta FAIR Paris at €125K base + €280K RSUs/4yr, and Anthropic is offering $200K base + significant equity in San Francisco. For Mistral, I need €125K base, €340K in pre-IPO equity over four years with anti-dilution protection, and a €25K signing bonus. My accept-at floor is €200K total comp annually. My Agentic AI and MoE training experience is exactly what Mistral needs for its next generation of models — there are fewer than 100 people in Europe with this combination of skills. The Agentic AI Premium is not optional; it's market rate for this skillset in 2026."
