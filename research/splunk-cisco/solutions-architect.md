#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Splunk (Cisco)

Solutions Architects at Splunk (Cisco) sit at the intersection of deep technical expertise and customer-facing strategic advisory. The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout generated immediate demand for Solutions Architects who can design enterprise deployment architectures for autonomous agent workflows. The February 25, 2026 general availability of AI Agent Monitoring amplified this demand as enterprise customers require tailored architectures that integrate AgenticOps into their existing security and observability stacks.

Cisco's $28B acquisition of Splunk in March 2024 created the broadest enterprise security and observability portfolio in the market. Solutions Architects who can design end-to-end Visibility-to-Remediation architectures — spanning Splunk SIEM, Cisco XDR, SOAR, and AgenticOps — are the primary mechanism through which this portfolio value reaches customers. Each enterprise deployment these architects design can represent millions in ARR.

Cisco RSU grants for Solutions Architects (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO) typically range from 1,000 to 2,500 shares, with additional performance-based equity for architects who drive significant deal value. Negotiate for above-band RSU grants by demonstrating your track record of designing architectures that accelerate enterprise adoption and expand account value.

### 🔭 Splunk AgenticOps & Visibility-to-Remediation Lever

Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring position Solutions Architects as Visibility-to-Remediation leaders who bridge observability and autonomous response within Cisco's security portfolio. Solutions Architects are the trusted advisors who help enterprises adopt these transformative capabilities.

The AgenticOps launch on February 10, 2026 created a new category of customer engagement for Solutions Architects. Enterprises want to deploy autonomous agents but need expert guidance on agent scope, decision boundaries, data access policies, and integration with existing SOC workflows. Solutions Architects who can design these deployments are directly enabling new revenue.

Visibility-to-Remediation architecture at the enterprise level is complex: it requires understanding the customer's existing Splunk deployment, their Cisco security infrastructure, their compliance requirements, and their organizational readiness for autonomous operations. Solutions Architects who can synthesize these inputs into a phased deployment architecture create exceptional customer and business value.

The February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA brings additional architectural considerations — monitoring agent performance, tuning decision thresholds, and building dashboards that give security teams confidence in autonomous operations. Position your expertise accordingly: "My enterprise architecture experience enables me to design Visibility-to-Remediation deployments that bridge Splunk's AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and the AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 with customer-specific requirements within Cisco's integrated security portfolio."

#### Global Lever 1: Splunk Platform & SPL2

Solutions Architects who deeply understand the Splunk platform and SPL2 can design data architectures that maximize search performance, optimize data tiering, and enable advanced analytics. This platform expertise directly translates to customer success and expanded deployments.

Negotiation language: "My deep Splunk platform and SPL2 expertise enables me to design data architectures that maximize customer value, driving adoption and expansion of the Splunk platform including new AgenticOps capabilities."

#### Global Lever 2: Cisco Security & XDR Integration

Solutions Architects who can design architectures spanning both Splunk and Cisco security products create the most comprehensive security deployments in the industry. This cross-portfolio design capability directly drives the combined Cisco-Splunk go-to-market motion.

Negotiation language: "I design end-to-end security architectures that leverage the full Cisco-Splunk portfolio, enabling customers to achieve Visibility-to-Remediation outcomes that no single-vendor competitor can match."

#### Global Lever 3: Observability & ITSI

Enterprise ITSI deployments require architects who understand service dependencies, KPI frameworks, and predictive analytics configuration. These architectures often represent the largest Splunk deployments by data volume and revenue.

Negotiation language: "My ITSI and observability architecture experience enables me to design enterprise deployments that serve as the telemetry backbone for both traditional monitoring and the new AgenticOps autonomous capabilities."

#### Global Lever 4: AI Agent Monitoring & AgenticOps

The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA created the most significant new architecture practice at Splunk in years. Solutions Architects who establish the design patterns for enterprise AgenticOps deployments will shape how every future customer adopts these capabilities.

Negotiation language: "The AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 require new enterprise architecture patterns — and I bring the customer-facing technical expertise to design, deploy, and scale these solutions within Cisco's security portfolio."
