*Total compensation includes base salary, Cisco RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Splunk (Cisco)

Data Scientists at Splunk (Cisco) build the ML models that power anomaly detection, threat scoring, and autonomous agent decision-making. The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout was built on data science foundations — predictive models that determine when agents should act autonomously versus escalate to humans. The February 25, 2026 general availability of AI Agent Monitoring extended these capabilities with production-grade monitoring of agent decision quality.

Cisco's $28B acquisition of Splunk in March 2024 created a data science opportunity of unprecedented scale. Splunk processes petabytes of machine data daily, and Data Scientists who can build models that transform this data into autonomous Visibility-to-Remediation workflows are working at the frontier of applied ML. This combination of massive data scale and high-stakes autonomous decision-making justifies top-of-market compensation.

Cisco RSU grants for Data Scientists (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO) typically range from 1,000 to 2,800 shares. Data Scientists working on AgenticOps or AI Agent Monitoring should negotiate for the upper range given the strategic importance and scarcity of relevant ML expertise in the security observability domain.

#### Splunk (Cisco) Level Mapping & Internal Titles

### 🔭 Splunk AgenticOps & Visibility-to-Remediation Lever

Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring position Data Scientists as Visibility-to-Remediation leaders who bridge observability and autonomous response within Cisco's security portfolio. The intelligence layer — the ML models that drive autonomous decisions — is the most critical component of the entire AgenticOps stack.

Data Scientists working on AgenticOps must solve uniquely challenging problems: building models that make high-stakes security decisions with minimal false positives, creating feedback loops that improve agent quality over time, and developing monitoring frameworks that detect model drift in real-time. The February 10, 2026 rollout demonstrated the viability of this approach, and the February 25 GA validated it for enterprise production use.

The Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline depends on Data Scientists at every stage — from anomaly detection in the visibility layer, through intelligent correlation and root cause analysis, to confidence scoring that determines remediation actions. Data Scientists who can build models across this full pipeline create exceptional value.

Articulate your ML expertise in AgenticOps terms: "My machine learning expertise in anomaly detection and autonomous decision systems directly powers Splunk's Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline, as demonstrated by the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA within Cisco's security portfolio."

#### Global Lever 1: Splunk Platform & SPL2

Data Scientists who can extend SPL2 with ML-native capabilities — inline model inference, feature engineering functions, and AutoML workflows — create platform-level value. This positions Splunk as an ML-first analytics platform rather than a traditional SIEM.

Negotiation language: "My expertise in building ML-native analytics workflows enables me to extend SPL2 with intelligent capabilities that differentiate Splunk's platform and power AgenticOps autonomous decisions."

#### Global Lever 2: Cisco Security & XDR Integration

Data Scientists who build threat detection and scoring models that work across Splunk and Cisco security telemetry (endpoint, network, cloud) create unified intelligence that no competitor can match. This cross-platform ML expertise commands significant premiums.

Negotiation language: "I build ML models that correlate threat signals across Splunk's data platform and Cisco's security telemetry, enabling unified Visibility-to-Remediation intelligence that powers XDR and AgenticOps."

#### Global Lever 3: Observability & ITSI

ITSI's predictive analytics capabilities — service health scoring, event correlation, and capacity forecasting — are built by Data Scientists. These models directly feed the AgenticOps pipeline with high-quality observability signals.

Negotiation language: "My predictive analytics expertise enhances ITSI's service intelligence while providing the high-fidelity observability signals that AgenticOps autonomous agents require for accurate decision-making."

#### Global Lever 4: AI Agent Monitoring & AgenticOps

The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA represent the pinnacle of applied data science at Splunk. Data Scientists on these initiatives are building the autonomous intelligence layer — the models that decide when to act, how to act, and when to defer to humans.

Negotiation language: "The AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 are powered by the exact ML capabilities I specialize in — autonomous decision models, confidence scoring, and real-time model monitoring at enterprise scale."
