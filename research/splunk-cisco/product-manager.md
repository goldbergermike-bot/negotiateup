#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Splunk (Cisco)

Product Managers at Splunk (Cisco) own the product vision that guides engineering execution. The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout was shaped by product decisions about agent capabilities, user workflows, and market positioning, while the February 25, 2026 general availability of AI Agent Monitoring required PMs to define enterprise-grade feature requirements and go-to-market strategy in record time.

Cisco's $28B acquisition of Splunk in March 2024 created a massive product portfolio that needs unified strategy. Product Managers who can define the Visibility-to-Remediation product vision — connecting Splunk's observability strengths with Cisco's security capabilities into a cohesive customer experience — are uniquely positioned to drive hundreds of millions in new ARR. This strategic influence commands compensation at the top of Cisco's PM bands.

Cisco RSU grants for Product Managers (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO) typically range from 1,000 to 3,000 shares depending on level. Senior and Principal PMs should negotiate aggressively for above-band RSU grants by demonstrating direct revenue impact on the AgenticOps and Visibility-to-Remediation product lines.

### 🔭 Splunk AgenticOps & Visibility-to-Remediation Lever

Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring position Product Managers as Visibility-to-Remediation leaders who bridge observability and autonomous response within Cisco's security portfolio. As a PM, you are the strategic voice that defines what these products do and why customers need them.

The AgenticOps product required PMs to define entirely new interaction paradigms — how do enterprises configure autonomous agents, set decision boundaries, and monitor agent behavior? The February 10, 2026 launch compressed the product definition cycle, and PMs who navigated this ambiguity while delivering clear requirements are demonstrably high-performers.

Visibility-to-Remediation as a product strategy requires PMs who understand both the observability buyer (IT operations, SRE teams) and the security buyer (SOC analysts, CISOs). Product Managers who can unify these personas into a single product narrative create enormous value for the combined Cisco-Splunk go-to-market motion.

Use product strategy language in your negotiation: "I define the product strategy for Visibility-to-Remediation workflows, connecting observability and autonomous response — as demonstrated by Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA — into a unified customer value proposition within Cisco's security portfolio."

#### Global Lever 1: Splunk Platform & SPL2

Product Managers who own the Splunk platform and SPL2 product strategy define the foundation for every downstream product. This platform-level product influence — shaping the query language, data model, and extensibility framework — creates leverage that compounds across the entire portfolio.

Negotiation language: "My platform product strategy experience positions me to shape SPL2 evolution, which is foundational to every product line at Splunk including the AgenticOps suite launching under the Cisco umbrella."

#### Global Lever 2: Cisco Security & XDR Integration

PMs defining the integrated Cisco-Splunk security product strategy must synthesize inputs from multiple business units, customer segments, and competitive landscapes. This strategic complexity and cross-organizational influence command a premium.

Negotiation language: "I bring the cross-portfolio product strategy experience to define how Splunk's data platform and Cisco's security infrastructure converge into a unified Visibility-to-Remediation product that wins in the enterprise security market."

#### Global Lever 3: Observability & ITSI

Product Managers in observability own significant ARR and must balance customer retention with innovation. ITSI product strategy requires deep understanding of enterprise IT operations workflows and the ability to evolve the product toward AI-driven predictive capabilities.

Negotiation language: "My observability product management background enables me to evolve ITSI and the observability suite to serve as the telemetry backbone for AgenticOps and AI Agent Monitoring."

#### Global Lever 4: AI Agent Monitoring & AgenticOps

The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA required visionary product management. PMs on these products are defining an entirely new category — autonomous security observability — and the compensation should reflect the market-creation responsibility.

Negotiation language: "The AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 represent category-creation product management. I bring the product vision and execution ability to define this new market within Cisco's portfolio."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $230,000 base with 1,800 Cisco RSUs ($117,000 at current CSCO price ~$65). Your accept-at floor should be $330,000 total comp. Cite the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout, the February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA, and your ability to deliver Visibility-to-Remediation across Cisco's security ecosystem.
