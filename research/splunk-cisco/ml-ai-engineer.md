*Total compensation includes base salary, Cisco RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Splunk (Cisco)

ML/AI Engineers at Splunk (Cisco) are the builders of the autonomous intelligence layer that differentiates the AgenticOps platform from every competitor. The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout was powered by ML models that detect anomalies, classify threats, and determine response actions without human intervention. The February 25, 2026 general availability of AI Agent Monitoring added ML-driven capabilities for monitoring agent behavior, detecting model drift, and ensuring decision quality — a new category of AI-monitoring-AI that requires cutting-edge ML engineering.

Cisco's $28B acquisition of Splunk in March 2024 brought together Splunk's ML capabilities (MLTK, anomaly detection, predictive analytics) with Cisco's AI investments (Talos intelligence, network behavior analysis, endpoint ML). ML/AI Engineers who can unify these capabilities into a coherent Visibility-to-Remediation intelligence layer are among the most sought-after engineers in the industry.

Cisco RSU grants for ML/AI Engineers (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO) are typically at or above the top of the engineering bands — 1,200 to 3,500 shares — reflecting the extreme demand for ML talent. Negotiate aggressively for above-band RSU grants by demonstrating your ability to ship production ML systems that drive autonomous decision-making.

### 🔭 Splunk AgenticOps & Visibility-to-Remediation Lever

Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring position ML/AI Engineers as Visibility-to-Remediation leaders who bridge observability and autonomous response within Cisco's security portfolio. ML/AI Engineers are the most critical talent for the AgenticOps platform because they build the intelligence that enables autonomous operation.

The AgenticOps ML stack is multi-layered: anomaly detection models identify unusual patterns, classification models determine threat type and severity, decision models select response actions, and confidence models determine whether to act autonomously or escalate to humans. The February 10, 2026 rollout required each layer to operate with enterprise-grade accuracy, and the February 25 GA added meta-models that monitor the decision quality of the autonomous agents themselves.

The Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline depends on ML at every stage — from intelligent alert deduplication in the visibility layer to root cause inference in the analysis layer to optimal action selection in the remediation layer. ML/AI Engineers who can build models across this full pipeline create compounding intelligence that gets better with every interaction.

When negotiating, lead with the scarcity of your skill set: "My production ML engineering expertise directly powers Splunk's Visibility-to-Remediation intelligence layer, enabling the autonomous capabilities launched with the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and monitored by the February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA. The combination of ML systems engineering and security domain expertise within Cisco's portfolio is exceptionally rare."

#### Global Lever 1: Splunk Platform & SPL2

ML/AI Engineers who can embed ML capabilities natively into SPL2 — enabling inline model inference, real-time feature engineering, and AutoML workflows — create platform-level differentiation that affects every Splunk customer.

Negotiation language: "My ML engineering expertise enables native intelligence within SPL2, transforming Splunk from a search platform into an AI-native analytics platform that powers AgenticOps and autonomous decision-making."

#### Global Lever 2: Cisco Security & XDR Integration

ML/AI Engineers who build models that correlate signals across Splunk and Cisco security telemetry create unified threat intelligence that no single-source model can match. This multi-source ML expertise is the key to Cisco's XDR differentiation.

Negotiation language: "I build ML models that fuse signals across Splunk's data platform and Cisco's security telemetry, creating unified Visibility-to-Remediation intelligence that powers XDR and AgenticOps simultaneously."

#### Global Lever 3: Observability & ITSI

ML/AI Engineers working on ITSI build predictive models for service health, capacity forecasting, and anomaly detection. These observability ML capabilities directly feed the AgenticOps pipeline with intelligent signals.

Negotiation language: "My predictive ML models enhance ITSI with intelligent service health scoring and anomaly detection, providing the high-quality observability signals that AgenticOps autonomous agents depend on."

#### Global Lever 4: AI Agent Monitoring & AgenticOps

The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA represent the most ML-intensive initiatives at Splunk. ML/AI Engineers on these teams build the core intelligence — the models that enable autonomous operation and the meta-models that monitor agent quality.

Negotiation language: "The AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 are fundamentally ML engineering achievements — autonomous decision models, confidence calibration, and AI-monitoring-AI systems that I am uniquely qualified to build and scale."
