### 🔭 Splunk AgenticOps & Visibility-to-Remediation Lever

Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring position Product Designers as Visibility-to-Remediation leaders who bridge observability and autonomous response within Cisco's security portfolio. Design is the critical layer that determines whether enterprises trust and adopt autonomous security tools.

The AgenticOps UX represents a fundamental design challenge: how do you give users confidence in autonomous agents while maintaining appropriate human oversight? The February 10, 2026 launch required designers to create novel interaction patterns for agent configuration, monitoring dashboards, and override mechanisms that had no existing design precedent.

The Visibility-to-Remediation user journey spans from initial alert investigation through root cause analysis to automated response. Designers who can create a fluid, trust-building experience across this journey — incorporating Splunk's data visualization strengths with Cisco's security context — create immense product differentiation. The February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA depended on design excellence to achieve enterprise-grade usability.

Frame your portfolio in Visibility-to-Remediation terms: "My design portfolio demonstrates expertise in complex data visualization, autonomous system interfaces, and trust-building UX patterns — directly applicable to Splunk's Visibility-to-Remediation journey launched with the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and scaling with the February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA."

#### Global Lever 1: Splunk Platform & SPL2

Designers who create the search, investigation, and dashboard experiences that millions of Splunk users interact with daily have platform-level impact. SPL2's new capabilities require new UX patterns that make powerful analytics accessible to broader audiences.

Negotiation language: "My experience designing complex analytics interfaces positions me to shape the SPL2 user experience, making Splunk's most powerful capabilities accessible to every user persona."

#### Global Lever 2: Cisco Security & XDR Integration

Unifying the design language across Splunk and Cisco security products is a massive design system challenge. Designers who can create a cohesive experience across XDR, SIEM, and SOAR are building the visual and interaction foundation for Cisco's entire security portfolio.

Negotiation language: "I bring design systems expertise that enables a unified experience across the Cisco-Splunk security portfolio, accelerating the Visibility-to-Remediation product vision through consistent, intuitive design."

#### Global Lever 3: Observability & ITSI

ITSI and observability design requires expertise in complex data visualization, service health dashboards, and predictive analytics UX. These skills directly transfer to AgenticOps agent monitoring interfaces.

Negotiation language: "My data visualization and observability design expertise creates the visual foundations that both ITSI enterprise customers and AgenticOps users depend on for operational excellence."

#### Global Lever 4: AI Agent Monitoring & AgenticOps

The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA required breakthrough UX design for autonomous agent interfaces. Designers who can create trust, transparency, and control in AI-driven workflows are among the most sought-after in the industry.

Negotiation language: "The AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 introduce entirely new UX paradigms for autonomous security — and I bring the design vision and execution ability to make these experiences enterprise-ready."
