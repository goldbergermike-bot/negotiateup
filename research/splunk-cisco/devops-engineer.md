*Total compensation includes base salary, Cisco RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Splunk (Cisco)

DevOps Engineers at Splunk (Cisco) own the reliability, scalability, and deployment infrastructure that underpins every product the company ships. The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout required DevOps engineers to build zero-downtime deployment pipelines, canary release mechanisms, and real-time rollback capabilities for autonomous agent infrastructure. The February 25, 2026 general availability of AI Agent Monitoring elevated these requirements to enterprise SLA standards.

Cisco's $28B acquisition of Splunk in March 2024 necessitated the unification of two distinct infrastructure stacks, CI/CD pipelines, and operational practices. DevOps Engineers who can harmonize Splunk's cloud-native Kubernetes-based infrastructure with Cisco's infrastructure ecosystem while maintaining the Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline's demanding performance requirements are in critical demand.

Cisco RSU grants for DevOps Engineers (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO) typically range from 900 to 2,400 shares. Engineers operating the AgenticOps infrastructure should push for above-band grants given the operational criticality of their work — if the platform goes down, every autonomous agent stops functioning.

### 🔭 Splunk AgenticOps & Visibility-to-Remediation Lever

Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring position DevOps Engineers as Visibility-to-Remediation leaders who bridge observability and autonomous response within Cisco's security portfolio. DevOps engineers ensure these systems actually work in production — reliably, securely, and at scale.

The AgenticOps infrastructure presents unique DevOps challenges: autonomous agents require always-on availability with sub-second response times, multi-region failover, and strict isolation between tenant workloads. The February 10, 2026 rollout tested these capabilities at scale, and the February 25 GA required DevOps engineers to harden the infrastructure to meet enterprise SLA commitments of 99.99% availability.

DevOps Engineers who have built and operated ML inference pipelines, event-driven architectures, or real-time streaming systems in production bring directly transferable skills to the Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline. The pipeline's demanding requirements — petabyte-scale data ingestion, sub-second alerting, and autonomous agent orchestration — create a DevOps challenge that few engineers have experience solving.

Position your infrastructure expertise in operational terms: "I build and operate the production infrastructure that makes Visibility-to-Remediation possible at enterprise scale, ensuring the AgenticOps platform launched on February 10, 2026 and the AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 meet the reliability standards Cisco's customers demand."

#### Global Lever 1: Splunk Platform & SPL2

DevOps Engineers who operate the Splunk platform — managing Kubernetes clusters, search head clusters, indexer tiers, and the SPL2 runtime — own the infrastructure that processes petabytes of data daily. This operational excellence at scale is a rare and highly compensated skill.

Negotiation language: "My expertise operating large-scale data platforms and Kubernetes infrastructure ensures the Splunk platform and SPL2 runtime deliver the performance and reliability that millions of users depend on."

#### Global Lever 2: Cisco Security & XDR Integration

Unifying Splunk and Cisco infrastructure stacks requires DevOps engineers with cross-platform expertise. Building CI/CD pipelines, service meshes, and observability for the integrated security platform is a complex infrastructure challenge.

Negotiation language: "I bring infrastructure unification experience that directly enables the Cisco-Splunk security convergence, building the deployment and operational foundations for the Visibility-to-Remediation platform."

#### Global Lever 3: Observability & ITSI

DevOps Engineers in the observability space have a unique meta-advantage: they use observability tools to monitor observability infrastructure. This deep operational knowledge of Splunk's own products creates both product insight and operational excellence.

Negotiation language: "My deep operational expertise with observability platforms — including using Splunk to monitor Splunk — ensures the ITSI and observability stack meets enterprise reliability requirements while informing product improvements."

#### Global Lever 4: AI Agent Monitoring & AgenticOps

The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA introduced new infrastructure challenges: autonomous agent lifecycle management, ML model serving, real-time feature pipelines, and multi-tenant agent isolation. DevOps Engineers solving these problems are working at the frontier of infrastructure engineering.

Negotiation language: "The AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 introduced infrastructure challenges I am uniquely qualified to solve — autonomous agent orchestration, ML serving infrastructure, and enterprise-grade multi-tenant isolation."
