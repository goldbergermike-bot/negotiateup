#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Splunk (Cisco)

The Visibility-to-Remediation Platform Engineer is the most strategically important engineering role at Splunk (Cisco) in 2026. This role exists because of a fundamental bet: that the future of enterprise security is not human analysts investigating alerts, but autonomous systems that detect, analyze, decide, and remediate — the full Visibility-to-Remediation loop. The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout was the first public demonstration of this vision, and the February 25, 2026 general availability of AI Agent Monitoring proved it could operate at enterprise scale with the transparency and control that CISOs demand.

When Cisco acquired Splunk for $28B in March 2024, the core thesis was that combining Splunk's data platform (the best visibility layer in the industry) with Cisco's security infrastructure (the broadest response layer in the industry) would create an end-to-end Visibility-to-Remediation platform that no competitor could match. The Visibility-to-Remediation Platform Engineer is the person who makes this thesis real — building the connective tissue between detection and response, between Splunk's observability and Cisco's security, between human oversight and autonomous action.

This role commands premium compensation for three reasons. First, it requires a rare combination of skills: data platform engineering, security domain expertise, ML systems understanding, and distributed systems architecture. Second, the business impact is enormous — every enterprise deployment of the Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline represents millions in ARR. Third, the talent supply is extremely limited because the role itself is new; there is no established career path for "Visibility-to-Remediation engineers," which means every hire requires significant investment and should be compensated accordingly.

Cisco RSU grants for this role (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO) should be at the top of the engineering bands: 1,500 to 4,000 shares for senior hires, with additional performance-based equity for engineers who directly impact the AgenticOps product roadmap. At CSCO's current price of approximately $65, this represents $97,500 to $260,000 in equity over the vesting period — a substantial component of total compensation that you should negotiate aggressively.

#### Splunk (Cisco) Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Splunk Title | Cisco Band | Typical YOE | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Platform Engineer II | Band 8 | 3–5 years | Entry to V2R pipeline |
| Senior Platform Engineer | Band 9 | 5–8 years | Owns pipeline components |
| Staff Platform Engineer | Band 10 | 8–12 years | Owns pipeline architecture |
| Principal Platform Engineer | Band 11 | 12–18 years | Cross-org technical leadership |
| Distinguished Platform Engineer | Band 12 | 15+ years | Sets V2R platform direction |

The Visibility-to-Remediation Platform Engineer role maps to Cisco's platform engineering ladder but carries an informal premium within Splunk due to its strategic importance. Hiring managers have flexibility to offer above-band compensation for candidates with directly relevant experience.

#### The Visibility-to-Remediation Pipeline — Architecture Overview

Understanding the full pipeline is essential for negotiation because it demonstrates the breadth and depth of expertise required:

1. **Visibility Layer** (Splunk Core): Data ingestion from hundreds of sources — logs, metrics, traces, security events. SPL2-powered indexing and search. Real-time streaming analytics for low-latency detection.

2. **Intelligence Layer** (ML/AI): Anomaly detection models, threat classification, entity behavior analytics. Feature engineering from multi-source telemetry. Confidence scoring for autonomous decision boundaries.

3. **Correlation Layer** (Splunk + Cisco): Cross-source signal correlation linking Splunk observability data with Cisco security telemetry (endpoints via Secure Endpoint, network via Secure Network Analytics, cloud via Umbrella). This is where the $28B acquisition value is realized.

4. **Decision Layer** (AgenticOps): Autonomous agent orchestration. Decision trees with confidence thresholds. Human escalation triggers. Agent lifecycle management. This layer was launched with the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout.

5. **Remediation Layer** (Cisco + SOAR): Automated response actions — endpoint isolation, firewall rule deployment, DNS sinkholing, ticket creation. SOAR playbook execution. Post-remediation verification loops.

6. **Monitoring Layer** (AI Agent Monitoring): Agent decision quality tracking. Model drift detection. Audit logging for compliance. Performance dashboards. This layer reached GA on February 25, 2026.

### 🔭 Splunk AgenticOps & Visibility-to-Remediation Lever

Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring position the Visibility-to-Remediation Platform Engineer as the definitive Visibility-to-Remediation leader who bridges observability and autonomous response within Cisco's security portfolio. No other role at Splunk (Cisco) has a more direct claim to this title.

The AgenticOps platform is the product manifestation of the Visibility-to-Remediation vision — autonomous agents that can traverse the full pipeline from initial signal detection to completed remediation without human intervention (with appropriate guardrails and monitoring). The February 10, 2026 rollout proved the concept, and the February 25 GA established it as an enterprise-ready capability. The Platform Engineer who builds and maintains this pipeline is literally building the future of security operations.

This role's negotiation leverage is unmatched for several reasons. The Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline spans every technical domain at Splunk (Cisco) — data platform, ML/AI, security, observability, and infrastructure. Engineers who can hold the full pipeline in their heads while making correct architectural decisions at each layer are extraordinarily rare. The pipeline also spans organizational boundaries — Splunk teams own the visibility and intelligence layers while Cisco teams own the response and remediation layers — requiring an engineer who can operate effectively across both organizations.

When negotiating, use the most direct framing possible: "I am the Visibility-to-Remediation Platform Engineer — the person who builds the end-to-end autonomous pipeline from detection to remediation. Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring demonstrate that this pipeline is Cisco's most strategic product investment, and I bring the full-stack platform engineering expertise to build, scale, and evolve it. My skills span data engineering, ML systems, security automation, and distributed architecture — the exact combination this signature role demands."

#### Global Lever 1: Splunk Platform & SPL2

The Visibility-to-Remediation Platform Engineer has deeper Splunk platform leverage than any other role because the V2R pipeline is the most demanding consumer of the Splunk platform. Real-time streaming search, sub-second correlation queries, and high-throughput indexing are all V2R requirements that push the platform to its limits.

Negotiation language: "I am the most demanding consumer of the Splunk platform — the Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline requires real-time SPL2 processing, sub-second correlation, and petabyte-scale indexing that pushes the platform to its architectural limits. My expertise in building on and extending the Splunk platform directly enables the AgenticOps autonomous pipeline."

#### Global Lever 2: Cisco Security & XDR Integration

The V2R Platform Engineer builds the integration layer between Splunk's visibility capabilities and Cisco's response infrastructure. This is where the $28B acquisition thesis is either validated or invalidated — and the Platform Engineer's architectural decisions determine the outcome.

Negotiation language: "I build the integration layer that connects Splunk's visibility with Cisco's security response — the exact pipeline that justifies the $28B acquisition. My Visibility-to-Remediation architecture decisions directly determine whether Cisco's XDR and AgenticOps platforms deliver the unified security experience that enterprise customers are demanding."

#### Global Lever 3: Observability & ITSI

The V2R pipeline consumes observability data as a primary input. Platform Engineers who understand how ITSI, APM, and infrastructure monitoring data feeds into the autonomous detection and correlation layers can build more intelligent and accurate Visibility-to-Remediation pipelines.

Negotiation language: "My observability platform expertise ensures the Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline ingests the highest-quality telemetry from ITSI and the observability stack, enabling AgenticOps agents to make accurate autonomous decisions based on comprehensive service and infrastructure context."

#### Global Lever 4: AI Agent Monitoring & AgenticOps

The V2R Platform Engineer is the owner of the AgenticOps infrastructure. The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA were delivered by Platform Engineers who built the agent orchestration framework, decision engine, and monitoring infrastructure. This is not an adjacent capability — it is the core of the role.

Negotiation language: "The AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 are the products I build. As the Visibility-to-Remediation Platform Engineer, I own the autonomous agent orchestration, decision engine, and monitoring infrastructure that constitute Splunk's most strategic initiative under Cisco."

#### Detailed Negotiation Playbook for V2R Platform Engineers

**Step 1: Establish the role's strategic importance.** Open by framing the Visibility-to-Remediation Platform Engineer as the signature role of the Cisco-Splunk combination. Reference the $28B acquisition and how the V2R pipeline is the product that validates the investment thesis.

**Step 2: Demonstrate full-pipeline expertise.** Walk through the V2R pipeline layers (Visibility, Intelligence, Correlation, Decision, Remediation, Monitoring) and demonstrate competency at each layer. This breadth is your primary differentiator.

**Step 3: Anchor to product launches.** Reference the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA as evidence of market urgency and competitive pressure. The compressed timeline between rollout and GA demonstrates how urgently Splunk needs V2R Platform Engineers.

**Step 4: Negotiate the full package.** Push for above-band on all compensation components — base salary, Cisco RSU grant, signing bonus, and performance bonus target. The scarcity of V2R Platform Engineers justifies exception-to-policy requests on multiple components.

**Step 5: Leverage competing offers.** Other companies building autonomous security operations (Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, Microsoft Security) are competing for the same talent pool. Use competing offers to validate your market rate and create urgency.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $275,000 base with 3,000 Cisco RSUs ($195,000 at current CSCO price ~$65). Your accept-at floor should be $400,000 total comp. Cite the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout, the February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA, and your ability to deliver Visibility-to-Remediation across Cisco's security ecosystem. As the signature V2R Platform Engineer role, you are positioned to request above-band compensation on every component — base, RSU, signing bonus, and performance target. This role is the embodiment of Cisco's $28B investment in Splunk, and your compensation should reflect that strategic importance.
