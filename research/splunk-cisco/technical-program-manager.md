#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Splunk (Cisco)

Technical Program Managers at Splunk (Cisco) are the execution orchestrators who ensure complex, cross-functional initiatives ship on time and at quality. The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout was a massive cross-team program requiring coordination across data platform, ML, security, UX, and infrastructure teams. The February 25, 2026 general availability of AI Agent Monitoring compressed the GA timeline to just 15 days after initial rollout — a pace only achievable with exceptional program management.

Cisco's $28B acquisition of Splunk in March 2024 multiplied program complexity exponentially. TPMs must now coordinate across two organizational structures, two planning cycles, and two engineering cultures while delivering the Visibility-to-Remediation roadmap. This cross-organizational program management is among the most challenging work in enterprise tech, and compensation reflects this difficulty.

Cisco RSU grants for Technical Program Managers (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO) typically range from 1,000 to 2,500 shares. TPMs who own the AgenticOps program should negotiate for above-band grants by demonstrating their direct impact on shipping critical revenue-generating products on schedule.

#### Splunk (Cisco) Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Splunk Title | Cisco Band | Typical Scope |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Technical Program Manager | Band 8–9 | Single program, 3–5 teams |
| Senior TPM | Band 9–10 | Multi-program, 5–10 teams |
| Principal TPM | Band 10–11 | Portfolio-level, 10+ teams |
| Director of TPM | Band 11–12 | Org-wide programs |

### 🔭 Splunk AgenticOps & Visibility-to-Remediation Lever

Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring position Technical Program Managers as Visibility-to-Remediation leaders who bridge observability and autonomous response within Cisco's security portfolio. TPMs are the connective tissue that makes these ambitious, cross-cutting programs possible.

The AgenticOps program required TPMs to manage dependencies across ML model training pipelines, agent orchestration frameworks, security review processes, and enterprise deployment tooling. The February 10, 2026 rollout date was a hard commitment to customers and partners, making the TPM's role in risk management and schedule tracking mission-critical.

The Visibility-to-Remediation roadmap is inherently cross-functional — it spans Splunk's data platform team, the security products team, the observability team, and Cisco's XDR and SecureX organizations. TPMs who can create clarity and alignment across these organizations while maintaining aggressive delivery timelines are exceptionally valuable.

The February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA — just 15 days after the initial AgenticOps rollout — demonstrated the kind of execution velocity that only world-class program management enables. Frame your TPM capabilities in these terms: "I drive cross-functional delivery of Visibility-to-Remediation programs like the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA, coordinating across engineering, security, and product teams within Cisco's integrated organization."

#### Global Lever 1: Splunk Platform & SPL2

TPMs managing Splunk platform programs coordinate across the most foundational engineering teams. SPL2 evolution, data platform scaling, and infrastructure modernization are programs that impact every product line and require sophisticated dependency management.

Negotiation language: "My platform program management experience ensures SPL2 and data platform initiatives ship on time and at quality, providing the foundation that every Splunk product — including AgenticOps — depends on."

#### Global Lever 2: Cisco Security & XDR Integration

The Cisco-Splunk integration is one of the most complex programs in enterprise tech. TPMs managing this integration must navigate organizational politics, technical dependencies, and competing priorities across both companies.

Negotiation language: "I bring cross-organizational program management expertise directly applicable to the Cisco-Splunk integration, ensuring the Visibility-to-Remediation roadmap ships despite the inherent complexity of unifying two large engineering organizations."

#### Global Lever 3: Observability & ITSI

ITSI and observability programs involve large enterprise customers with complex deployment requirements. TPMs must manage customer-facing delivery alongside internal engineering programs.

Negotiation language: "My experience managing enterprise-facing technical programs ensures ITSI and observability initiatives deliver customer value while building the telemetry foundations that AgenticOps depends on."

#### Global Lever 4: AI Agent Monitoring & AgenticOps

The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA were the most complex programs at Splunk in 2026. TPMs who drove these launches managed unprecedented cross-functional complexity — ML, security, infrastructure, and product teams all coordinating toward hard launch dates.

Negotiation language: "The AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 were delivered through the kind of cross-functional program management I specialize in — managing ML, security, platform, and infrastructure dependencies under aggressive timelines."
