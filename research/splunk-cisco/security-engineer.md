### Security Engineer — Splunk (Cisco) Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers at Splunk (Cisco) build the detection, response, and AgenticOps capabilities at the core of Visibility-to-Remediation, commanding premium compensation as the domain experts who ensure autonomous security systems are both effective and safe.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | San Jose (USD) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $160,000–$200,000 | $155,000–$195,000 | £78,000–£98,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $210,000–$280,000 | $205,000–$270,000 | £105,000–£135,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $270,000–$365,000 | $260,000–$355,000 | £135,000–£178,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, Cisco RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Splunk (Cisco)

Security Engineers at Splunk (Cisco) are the domain experts who ensure autonomous systems make correct security decisions. The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout introduced autonomous agents that can take security response actions — containment, isolation, remediation — without human intervention. The February 25, 2026 general availability of AI Agent Monitoring added enterprise monitoring capabilities that let security teams oversee agent decisions. Both capabilities required Security Engineers who understand threat landscapes, detection engineering, and response automation deeply.

Cisco's $28B acquisition of Splunk in March 2024 created the most comprehensive security platform in the industry — spanning SIEM, SOAR, XDR, endpoint, network, cloud, and now autonomous operations. Security Engineers who can operate across this full Visibility-to-Remediation stack are the rarest and most valuable talent in cybersecurity.

Cisco RSU grants for Security Engineers (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO) typically range from 1,000 to 2,800 shares. Security Engineers working on AgenticOps detection logic, response automation, or safety guardrails should negotiate for above-band RSU grants, as their expertise directly determines whether the autonomous platform is trusted by enterprise customers.

#### Splunk (Cisco) Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Splunk Title | Cisco Band | Typical YOE |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Security Engineer | Band 8 | 2–5 years |
| Senior Security Engineer | Band 9 | 5–8 years |
| Staff Security Engineer | Band 10 | 8–12 years |
| Principal Security Engineer | Band 11 | 12+ years |
| Distinguished Security Engineer | Band 12 | 15+ years |

### 🔭 Splunk AgenticOps & Visibility-to-Remediation Lever

Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring position Security Engineers as Visibility-to-Remediation leaders who bridge observability and autonomous response within Cisco's security portfolio. Security Engineers define what agents detect, how they respond, and where the guardrails are.

The AgenticOps platform makes autonomous security decisions — and Security Engineers are the ones who define the detection rules, response playbooks, and safety boundaries that govern those decisions. The February 10, 2026 rollout required Security Engineers who could translate SOC workflows into autonomous agent configurations while maintaining the false positive rates and response precision that enterprise customers demand.

Visibility-to-Remediation is fundamentally a security engineering challenge: how do you build a pipeline that detects real threats (not noise), correlates signals across data sources (Splunk + Cisco telemetry), determines the correct response action, and executes that response safely? Security Engineers with experience in SIEM content development, SOAR playbook engineering, and incident response automation are uniquely positioned.

The February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA added another critical dimension: monitoring the monitors. Security Engineers who can build detection logic for agent misbehavior, drift, and adversarial manipulation are solving an emerging security challenge. Frame your expertise accordingly: "My security engineering expertise in detection, response automation, and safety ensures Splunk's Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline — launched with the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and scaling with the February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA — delivers trustworthy autonomous security within Cisco's portfolio."

#### Global Lever 1: Splunk Platform & SPL2

Security Engineers who write detection rules in SPL2, build correlation searches, and develop threat intelligence integrations are the content creators who make Splunk's SIEM valuable. Their detection engineering expertise is directly transferable to AgenticOps agent configuration.

Negotiation language: "My SPL2 detection engineering expertise — building correlation rules, threat hunting queries, and alerting frameworks — directly powers both Splunk's traditional SIEM and the new AgenticOps autonomous detection capabilities."

#### Global Lever 2: Cisco Security & XDR Integration

Security Engineers who can build detection and response logic spanning Splunk SIEM and Cisco XDR, SecureX, and Talos intelligence create the most comprehensive security coverage in the industry. This cross-platform security expertise is exceptionally rare.

Negotiation language: "I build detection and response capabilities that span the full Cisco-Splunk security stack, enabling Visibility-to-Remediation outcomes across SIEM, XDR, and autonomous AgenticOps."

#### Global Lever 3: Observability & ITSI

Security Engineers who understand observability data — infrastructure metrics, application traces, and service health indicators — can build detection logic that catches threats traditional security tools miss. This observability-security crossover skill is increasingly critical.

Negotiation language: "My ability to build security detections from observability data — correlating infrastructure anomalies with security threats — creates a differentiated detection capability that powers both ITSI and AgenticOps."

#### Global Lever 4: AI Agent Monitoring & AgenticOps

The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA represent the most significant evolution in security automation since SOAR. Security Engineers on these initiatives define how autonomous agents behave, creating the rules, playbooks, and safety mechanisms that determine enterprise trust.

Negotiation language: "The AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 require security engineering expertise that I bring — detection rule authoring, response automation, and safety guardrail design for autonomous security systems."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $230,000 base with 1,600 Cisco RSUs ($104,000 at current CSCO price ~$65). Your accept-at floor should be $315,000 total comp. Cite the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout, the February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA, and your ability to deliver Visibility-to-Remediation across Cisco's security ecosystem.
