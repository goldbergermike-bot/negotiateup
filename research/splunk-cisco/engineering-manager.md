#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Splunk (Cisco)

Engineering Managers at Splunk (Cisco) own the team execution that turns product vision into shipped software. The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout was delivered by engineering teams under intense timeline pressure, and the February 25, 2026 general availability of AI Agent Monitoring required managers who could coordinate cross-functional dependencies across Splunk and Cisco organizations simultaneously.

Cisco's $28B acquisition of Splunk in March 2024 created a complex organizational landscape where Engineering Managers must navigate two engineering cultures, two planning processes, and two career ladder systems while maintaining team velocity. Managers who can thrive in this dual-context environment — keeping teams productive during integration while shipping on the Visibility-to-Remediation roadmap — are exceptionally valuable.

Engineering Manager Cisco RSU grants typically range from 1,500 to 3,500 shares (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO), with above-band grants available for managers taking on AgenticOps or Visibility-to-Remediation team ownership. Negotiate for the upper end of the RSU range by demonstrating your ability to recruit, retain, and lead engineers through high-velocity product launches.

#### Splunk (Cisco) Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Splunk Title | Cisco Band | Typical Scope |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Engineering Manager | Band 9–10 | 5–10 direct reports |
| Senior Engineering Manager | Band 10–11 | 10–20 engineers, 2–3 teams |
| Director of Engineering | Band 11 | 20–40 engineers, org-level scope |
| Senior Director | Band 12 | 40+ engineers, multi-org scope |

### 🔭 Splunk AgenticOps & Visibility-to-Remediation Lever

Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring position Engineering Managers as Visibility-to-Remediation leaders who bridge observability and autonomous response within Cisco's security portfolio. As a manager, your lever is the ability to build and lead the teams that deliver these critical initiatives.

The AgenticOps program required Engineering Managers who could staff cross-functional teams with the right mix of ML engineers, platform engineers, and security specialists. The compressed timeline between the February 10, 2026 rollout and the February 25 GA demanded exceptional project management and technical judgment from engineering leaders.

Engineering Managers who have led teams through major product launches, organizational integrations (like post-acquisition transitions), or platform migrations bring directly transferable skills. The Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline requires coordination across data platform, security, and AI/ML teams — and managers who can orchestrate this cross-team delivery are in critical demand.

In your negotiation, frame your management experience in delivery terms: "I have led engineering teams through complex product launches and organizational transitions, directly applicable to Splunk's Visibility-to-Remediation roadmap including the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA within Cisco's integrated security organization."

#### Global Lever 1: Splunk Platform & SPL2

Engineering Managers overseeing platform teams are responsible for the foundational infrastructure that every Splunk product depends on. Managing SPL2 evolution, data ingestion scalability, and search performance requires both deep technical understanding and strong people leadership.

Negotiation language: "My experience managing platform engineering teams ensures I can lead the SPL2 and data platform teams that underpin every Splunk product, from SIEM to the new AgenticOps initiative."

#### Global Lever 2: Cisco Security & XDR Integration

Managers leading integration-focused teams must coordinate across Splunk and Cisco organizational boundaries. This dual-reporting complexity and the political navigation required to ship cross-organizational features command a premium.

Negotiation language: "I have proven experience leading cross-organizational engineering teams through complex integrations, directly applicable to the Cisco-Splunk security convergence and Visibility-to-Remediation strategy."

#### Global Lever 3: Observability & ITSI

Engineering Managers in the observability organization own teams responsible for significant ARR. ITSI, APM, and infrastructure monitoring teams require managers who understand both the technical and business dimensions of observability.

Negotiation language: "My observability engineering management background positions me to lead teams delivering the telemetry foundation that both ITSI enterprise customers and AgenticOps autonomous agents depend on."

#### Global Lever 4: AI Agent Monitoring & AgenticOps

The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA were delivered by teams that required exceptional engineering management. These new-product teams face unique challenges: ambiguous requirements, aggressive timelines, and the need to hire specialized talent rapidly.

Negotiation language: "The AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 represent Splunk's most ambitious launches under Cisco — and I bring the team leadership, hiring expertise, and execution track record to drive these initiatives forward."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $255,000 base with 2,000 Cisco RSUs ($130,000 at current CSCO price ~$65). Your accept-at floor should be $360,000 total comp. Cite the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout, the February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA, and your ability to deliver Visibility-to-Remediation across Cisco's security ecosystem.
