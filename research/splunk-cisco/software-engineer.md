*Total compensation includes base salary, Cisco RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Splunk (Cisco)

Splunk's integration into Cisco's portfolio following the $28B acquisition in March 2024 has created unprecedented demand for Software Engineers who can build across both observability and security platforms. The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout marks a pivotal inflection point where autonomous agent workflows require robust engineering foundations, and the February 25, 2026 general availability of AI Agent Monitoring extends this into production-grade capability that enterprises are racing to adopt.

Software Engineers who demonstrate competency in Visibility-to-Remediation workflows — connecting detection, triage, and automated response — are positioned at the center of Cisco's most strategic product investment. This convergence of observability and security under the Splunk umbrella means that even mid-level engineers can negotiate above-band offers by demonstrating relevant experience with event-driven architectures, streaming data pipelines, and autonomous remediation logic.

The Cisco RSU component of your compensation (vesting over 4 years on NASDAQ: CSCO) adds meaningful long-term upside, especially as the AgenticOps product line matures and drives incremental ARR. Negotiating for a larger RSU grant is often more achievable than base salary increases given Cisco's structured pay bands.

### 🔭 Splunk AgenticOps & Visibility-to-Remediation Lever

Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring position Software Engineers as Visibility-to-Remediation leaders who bridge observability and autonomous response within Cisco's security portfolio. This is the single most powerful negotiation lever available to engineering candidates in 2026.

AgenticOps represents Splunk's strategic bet on autonomous operations — AI agents that can detect anomalies, correlate signals across telemetry streams, and initiate remediation without human intervention. Software Engineers building these systems are working on the highest-priority initiative within the combined Cisco-Splunk organization, and compensation reflects this urgency.

The Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline — from raw log ingestion through SPL2 processing to automated response actions — requires Software Engineers who understand both the data platform layer and the security orchestration layer. Candidates who can articulate experience across this full stack have substantial leverage in negotiations.

When framing your value, emphasize how your skills accelerate the AgenticOps roadmap: "My experience with event-driven architectures and autonomous response systems directly supports the Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline that Splunk launched with the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and is scaling with the February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA."

#### Global Lever 1: Splunk Platform & SPL2

The Splunk platform remains the backbone of enterprise observability, and SPL2 — the next-generation search processing language — is central to every product initiative. Software Engineers with SPL2 experience or adjacent query language expertise (KQL, PromQL, SQL) can negotiate premiums by demonstrating readiness to contribute to the platform layer that powers AgenticOps and all downstream capabilities.

Negotiation language: "My fluency in data query languages and distributed systems positions me to accelerate SPL2 adoption, which is foundational to every Splunk product line including the new AgenticOps suite."

#### Global Lever 2: Cisco Security & XDR Integration

The Cisco acquisition created a unified security platform spanning XDR, SIEM, SOAR, and now AgenticOps. Software Engineers who can build integrations between Splunk's data platform and Cisco's security stack (SecureX, Talos, Duo) are in extremely high demand. This cross-platform competency commands a 10–15% premium over standard Splunk engineering roles.

Negotiation language: "I bring integration experience across security platforms that directly accelerates Cisco's XDR and Visibility-to-Remediation strategy, reducing time-to-value for the combined Splunk-Cisco security portfolio."

#### Global Lever 3: Observability & ITSI

Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) and the broader observability stack generate significant enterprise revenue. Software Engineers contributing to ITSI, APM, or infrastructure monitoring can leverage the growing importance of observability in the AgenticOps context — autonomous agents need high-fidelity telemetry to operate effectively.

Negotiation language: "My observability engineering background ensures the telemetry foundations that AgenticOps and AI Agent Monitoring depend on are production-grade and scalable."

#### Global Lever 4: AI Agent Monitoring & AgenticOps

The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA represent the largest new product investment at Splunk since the Cisco acquisition. Software Engineers hired into or adjacent to these teams have outsized negotiation leverage because the headcount demand far exceeds the supply of engineers with relevant autonomous systems experience.

Negotiation language: "The AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and the AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 signal that Splunk is making its largest platform bet since joining Cisco — and I bring the exact skill set this initiative requires."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $185,000 base with 800 Cisco RSUs ($52,000 at current CSCO price ~$65). Your accept-at floor should be $230,000 total comp. Cite the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout, the February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA, and your ability to deliver Visibility-to-Remediation across Cisco's security ecosystem.
