### Data Engineer — Splunk (Cisco) Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Engineers at Splunk (Cisco) build the petabyte-scale pipelines powering AgenticOps and Visibility-to-Remediation, commanding premium compensation for ensuring autonomous agents have the right data at the right time with sub-second latency.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | San Francisco (USD) | San Jose (USD) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $155,000–$195,000 | $150,000–$190,000 | £75,000–£95,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $200,000–$270,000 | $195,000–$260,000 | £100,000–£130,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $260,000–$350,000 | $250,000–$340,000 | £130,000–£172,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, Cisco RSU grants (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Splunk (Cisco)

Data Engineers at Splunk (Cisco) are responsible for the data infrastructure that makes everything else possible. The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout demanded data pipelines that could feed autonomous agents with real-time telemetry — logs, metrics, traces, and security events — at enterprise scale. The February 25, 2026 general availability of AI Agent Monitoring required additional data engineering to capture agent decision logs, performance metrics, and audit trails for enterprise compliance.

Cisco's $28B acquisition of Splunk in March 2024 created the world's largest enterprise data platform for security and observability. Data Engineers who can design and operate data pipelines spanning Splunk's ingestion framework and Cisco's telemetry sources are building the Visibility-to-Remediation data backbone that powers every product in the portfolio. This foundational importance justifies premium compensation.

Cisco RSU grants for Data Engineers (4-year vest, NASDAQ: CSCO) typically range from 900 to 2,400 shares. Data Engineers working on AgenticOps data pipelines or the unified Cisco-Splunk data layer should negotiate for above-band RSU grants given the foundational nature of their work — every feature and product depends on data pipeline quality.

#### Splunk (Cisco) Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Splunk Title | Cisco Band | Typical YOE |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Data Engineer | Band 7–8 | 1–4 years |
| Senior Data Engineer | Band 9 | 4–8 years |
| Staff Data Engineer | Band 10 | 8–12 years |
| Principal Data Engineer | Band 11 | 12+ years |
| Distinguished Data Engineer | Band 12 | 15+ years |

### 🔭 Splunk AgenticOps & Visibility-to-Remediation Lever

Splunk's February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and February 25 GA of AI Agent Monitoring position Data Engineers as Visibility-to-Remediation leaders who bridge observability and autonomous response within Cisco's security portfolio. Without the data pipelines Data Engineers build, autonomous agents have nothing to analyze and no signals to act on.

The AgenticOps platform requires data pipelines with exceptional characteristics: sub-second latency for real-time agent decisions, petabyte-scale throughput for enterprise data volumes, multi-source correlation across Splunk and Cisco telemetry, and strict data lineage for audit compliance. The February 10, 2026 rollout validated these pipeline capabilities, and the February 25 GA demanded production hardening for enterprise SLA requirements.

The Visibility-to-Remediation pipeline is, at its core, a data engineering challenge. Data must flow from hundreds of telemetry sources, be normalized, enriched, correlated, and delivered to both human analysts and autonomous agents in real-time. Data Engineers who can build these pipelines with the required latency, reliability, and scale are building the nervous system of the entire platform.

Position your data engineering expertise as foundational: "My petabyte-scale data pipeline expertise is the foundation that makes Visibility-to-Remediation possible, powering both the February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25 AI Agent Monitoring GA with real-time, high-fidelity data across Cisco's security and observability portfolio."

#### Global Lever 1: Splunk Platform & SPL2

Data Engineers who build and optimize Splunk's data ingestion, indexing, and search infrastructure are working on the core platform. Understanding data tiering, index optimization, and SPL2 query performance at scale is essential and highly valued.

Negotiation language: "My data platform expertise in ingestion, indexing, and query optimization at petabyte scale directly enhances the Splunk platform and SPL2 performance that every product and every customer depends on."

#### Global Lever 2: Cisco Security & XDR Integration

Unifying data from Splunk and Cisco security sources requires complex ETL pipelines, schema normalization, and data federation. Data Engineers who can build the unified data layer enable the cross-platform Visibility-to-Remediation vision.

Negotiation language: "I build the unified data pipelines that enable cross-platform Visibility-to-Remediation, normalizing and correlating telemetry across Splunk's data platform and Cisco's security infrastructure."

#### Global Lever 3: Observability & ITSI

ITSI and the observability stack process massive data volumes — infrastructure metrics, application traces, and service health indicators. Data Engineers who optimize these pipelines directly impact platform performance and customer satisfaction.

Negotiation language: "My observability data pipeline experience ensures ITSI and the observability stack handle enterprise data volumes while feeding high-quality signals to AgenticOps autonomous agents."

#### Global Lever 4: AI Agent Monitoring & AgenticOps

The February 10, 2026 AgenticOps rollout and the February 25, 2026 AI Agent Monitoring GA required novel data engineering: real-time feature pipelines for ML models, agent decision audit trails, and monitoring data for agent performance tracking. These are frontier data engineering challenges.

Negotiation language: "The AgenticOps rollout on February 10, 2026 and AI Agent Monitoring GA on February 25, 2026 depend on the exact data engineering capabilities I specialize in — real-time feature pipelines, ML data infrastructure, and enterprise-scale audit data management."
