### 🏗️ AI-Enhanced Connector Development Lever

In February 2026, Fivetran software engineers are building AI-enhanced connectors and pipeline features — connectors that self-configure, monitoring that auto-diagnoses, and data quality checks that improve automatically. Engineers at all levels contribute to this platform evolution.

Your connector work directly impacts enterprise data freshness and reliability. Every connector you build, every bug you fix, and every reliability improvement helps Fivetran maintain its position as the data integration standard.

**Global Levers**

1. **Connector Platform Scale:** "I'm building connectors for a platform serving 5K+ enterprises. My equity should reflect the platform scale and AI automation opportunity."
2. **Snowflake/Airbyte Counter:** "I have SWE offers from Snowflake and well-funded data startups with higher base salaries. Fivetran should match the base and differentiate with equity upside."
3. **Integration Expertise:** "Building reliable data connectors across diverse APIs, databases, and file systems requires breadth across protocols and systems. This versatility accelerates connector velocity."
4. **Growth-Stage Premium:** "Joining a growth-stage company during an AI transformation carries risk. My equity grant should reflect this risk-reward balance with meaningful upside."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $148K equity over 4 years with a $175K base and 11% bonus target. I'm building the connectors and AI features for the leading data integration platform. I have Snowflake and other data platform offers with higher guaranteed comp. Fivetran's equity should make the growth opportunity compelling." Accept if above $135K equity.
