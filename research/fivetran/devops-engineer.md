### DevOps Engineer | Fivetran Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Weighted + Reliability Bonus | Multi-Cloud Pipeline Infrastructure 2026

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland / Remote-US | $158K–$195K | $98K–$178K | 10–15% | $200K–$262K |
| Denver | $152K–$188K | $92K–$168K | 10–15% | $192K–$250K |
| London | £112K–£140K | £68K–£122K | 10–15% | £142K–£182K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Fivetran DevOps Engineers manage the multi-cloud infrastructure that runs 500+ data connectors across AWS, GCP, and Azure — processing trillions of rows monthly with five-nines reliability expectations. In February 2026, AI-powered features introduce GPU workloads, model serving infrastructure, and real-time inference alongside the existing connector execution framework. DevOps engineers who can manage multi-cloud infrastructure supporting both traditional ELT and AI workloads are essential.

Fivetran's DevOps compensation includes equity-weighted packages with reliability bonuses reflecting the infrastructure's critical importance. The complexity of running 500+ connectors across three cloud providers with enterprise SLAs creates strong leverage for experienced platform engineers.

**Level Mapping:** Fivetran DevOps = Google SRE L3-L4 = Snowflake Platform Eng = Datadog Infra Eng = AWS DevOps

### 🏗️ AI-Ready Multi-Cloud Pipeline Platform Lever

In February 2026, Fivetran's infrastructure must support both traditional connector execution and new AI workloads — model inference for schema prediction, GPU compute for connector generation, and real-time monitoring across three cloud providers. DevOps Engineers architecting this hybrid infrastructure enable the AI product roadmap.

Your infrastructure decisions directly impact Fivetran's cloud costs, connector reliability, and deployment velocity. Every reliability improvement compounds across the trillions of rows processed monthly for 5,000+ enterprise customers.

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Cloud AI Infrastructure:** "I'm managing infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Azure supporting 500+ connectors plus AI workloads. This multi-cloud complexity commands a premium over single-cloud roles."
2. **Datadog/Snowflake Counter:** "I have infrastructure offers from Datadog and Snowflake with higher base and equity. Fivetran must be competitive given the multi-cloud AI infrastructure complexity."
3. **Cost Optimization Impact:** "My multi-cloud cost optimization experience has saved $3M+ annually. This directly impacts Fivetran's margins — my comp should reflect the bottom-line impact."
4. **Reliability Revenue Impact:** "Connector uptime directly drives enterprise customer retention. My SRE experience maintaining five-nines across three clouds has measurable revenue impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $172K equity over 4 years with a $190K base and 12% bonus with reliability targets. I'm managing the multi-cloud infrastructure supporting 500+ connectors and AI workloads across three cloud providers. I have Datadog and Snowflake offers with higher guaranteed comp. Fivetran's package must be competitive." Accept if above $158K equity.
