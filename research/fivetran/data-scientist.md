### Data Scientist | Fivetran Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Equity + Performance Bonus | AI Pipeline Intelligence & Data Quality 2026

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland / Remote-US | $168K–$205K | $115K–$208K | 10–15% | $222K–$285K |
| Denver | $162K–$198K | $108K–$198K | 10–15% | $212K–$272K |
| London | £118K–£150K | £80K–£145K | 10–15% | £155K–£205K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Fivetran Data Scientists build the models powering intelligent pipeline management — anomaly detection in data flows, automated schema change prediction, data quality scoring, and AI-driven pipeline optimization across 500+ connectors. In February 2026, Fivetran is investing heavily in AI-powered data observability — using ML to predict pipeline failures before they happen, detect data drift, and automatically adjust sync frequencies based on usage patterns.

Fivetran's DS compensation includes strong equity with performance bonuses tied to model impact. Data Scientists who combine ML expertise with data pipeline domain knowledge — understanding the nuances of data freshness, schema evolution, and connector reliability — command premium packages.

**Level Mapping:** Fivetran DS = Google L4 DS = Snowflake DS = Databricks DS = Monte Carlo DS

### 🏗️ AI Data Observability Intelligence Lever

In February 2026, Fivetran's AI-powered data observability is becoming a key product differentiator — predictive failure detection, automated anomaly classification, and intelligent sync optimization. Data Scientists building these models define the intelligence layer that keeps enterprise data pipelines reliable at scale.

Your models directly impact customer experience — every improvement in failure prediction accuracy or anomaly detection reduces pipeline downtime and data quality incidents for 5,000+ enterprise customers.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Observability Differentiation:** "I'm building the ML models that power Fivetran's predictive data observability — the key differentiator against Airbyte and cloud-native ELT. My equity should reflect the product impact."
2. **Snowflake/Databricks DS Counter:** "I have DS offers from Snowflake and Databricks with higher guaranteed comp. Fivetran's equity must provide upside that makes the growth-stage bet compelling."
3. **Pipeline ML Expertise:** "My expertise in time-series anomaly detection and predictive maintenance directly applies to pipeline intelligence. This domain specialization reduces ramp time significantly."
4. **Customer Reliability Impact:** "My models directly reduce pipeline downtime and data quality incidents. The bonus should have a reliability improvement component tied to customer outcomes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $202K equity over 4 years with a $200K base and 13% bonus target. I'm building the AI observability models that differentiate Fivetran — predictive pipeline intelligence for 5K+ enterprises. I have Snowflake and Monte Carlo DS offers with higher guaranteed comp. Fivetran's equity must reflect the AI data observability growth opportunity." Accept if above $188K equity.
