### Senior Software Engineer | Fivetran Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Strong Equity + Bonus | AI-Automated Connector & Platform Architecture 2026

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland / Remote-US | $182K–$222K | $135K–$248K | 10–15% | $248K–$330K |
| Denver | $178K–$215K | $128K–$238K | 10–15% | $240K–$318K |
| London | £130K–£162K | £92K–£172K | 10–15% | £175K–£235K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Fivetran Senior Software Engineers own critical systems across the data pipeline platform — from connector framework architecture to pipeline orchestration, data quality monitoring, and AI-automated features. In February 2026, senior engineers lead the technical integration of AI into the connector development workflow — building the frameworks that enable AI-generated connectors, designing self-healing pipeline systems, and architecting the intelligent data observability layer.

Fivetran offers strong equity grants to senior engineers reflecting their outsized impact on a platform serving 5,000+ enterprise customers. Senior engineers who can design systems that scale connector development from manual to AI-automated while maintaining reliability are in exceptional demand.

**Level Mapping:** Fivetran Senior SWE = Google L5 = Snowflake Senior = Databricks Senior = Meta E5

### 🏗️ AI-Automated Connector Framework Lever

In February 2026, Fivetran's senior engineers are building the frameworks that transform connector development from manual engineering to AI-automated generation. The connector framework must support both traditional hand-coded connectors and AI-generated ones, while the pipeline orchestration layer must handle self-healing and auto-configuration.

Your architectural decisions shape Fivetran's ability to scale connector coverage from 500+ to thousands using AI. Every framework improvement compounds across the entire connector ecosystem and impacts all 5,000+ enterprise customers.

**Global Levers**

1. **Framework Architecture Impact:** "My connector framework architecture decisions affect every connector — existing and AI-generated. My equity should reflect the platform-wide leverage of this work."
2. **Snowflake/Databricks Counter:** "I have senior SWE offers from Snowflake and Databricks at $360K+ total comp. Fivetran's equity must provide meaningful upside to bridge the guaranteed comp gap."
3. **Connector Scale Expertise:** "I bring experience building maintainable integration frameworks at scale. This directly accelerates the AI connector generation system — reducing development timelines by quarters."
4. **Technical Leadership Premium:** "My code reviews and architectural guidance affect every connector engineer. This org-wide leverage extends well beyond individual features — my comp should reflect it."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $242K equity over 4 years with a $218K base and 13% bonus target. I'm designing the AI-automated connector framework that enables Fivetran to scale to thousands of connectors. I have Snowflake and Databricks Senior offers at $365K+ guaranteed. Fivetran's equity must make the growth-stage opportunity rational." Accept if above $225K equity.
