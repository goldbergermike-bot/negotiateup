### Product Designer | Fivetran Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Equity + Bonus | AI-Automated Pipeline UX Design 2026

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland / Remote-US | $152K–$185K | $82K–$152K | 10–15% | $188K–$245K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Fivetran Product Designers shape how data engineers and analysts interact with automated data pipelines — designing interfaces for connector configuration, pipeline monitoring, data quality alerting, and increasingly AI-powered features. In February 2026, AI-automated connectors and self-healing pipelines require fundamentally new UX patterns — how do you design for systems that configure themselves? How do you present AI-generated pipeline recommendations? Designers who can create intuitive experiences for AI-automated data infrastructure are essential.

Fivetran offers balanced equity with competitive base and bonus for design roles. Designers who can make complex data pipeline operations accessible through AI-native interfaces command premium packages in the data infrastructure space.

**Level Mapping:** Fivetran PD = Google L4 UX = Snowflake PD = Databricks Designer = Datadog PD

### 🏗️ AI-Native Pipeline UX Lever

In February 2026, Fivetran is redesigning its core pipeline experience around AI automation — connector setup that requires zero configuration, pipeline monitoring dashboards that surface AI-predicted issues, and natural language pipeline management. Product Designers defining these interaction patterns establish the UX standard for AI-automated data tools.

Your design decisions directly impact how thousands of data teams interact with AI-automated pipelines. Every UX improvement increases feature adoption and reduces the operational burden on data engineers — the value proposition that drives Fivetran's growth.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Automation UX Pioneer:** "I'm designing UX for AI-automated data infrastructure — how users interact with self-configuring, self-healing systems. This is novel design territory that commands a premium."
2. **Snowflake/Datadog Counter:** "I have design offers from Snowflake and Datadog with stronger base salaries. Fivetran should match the base and add equity reflecting the AI UX transformation."
3. **Data Tool Design Expertise:** "My expertise in designing data infrastructure tools directly accelerates Fivetran's AI UX roadmap. This specialization is rare in the design market."
4. **Adoption Impact:** "Design quality directly drives connector adoption and retention. My portfolio shows 25%+ setup completion improvements — my bonus should reflect measurable user impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $148K equity over 4 years with a $182K base and 12% bonus target. I'm designing the AI-automated pipeline experience — making self-configuring data infrastructure intuitive. I have Snowflake and Datadog design offers with higher guaranteed comp. Fivetran's equity should reflect the UX impact on product growth." Accept if above $135K equity.
