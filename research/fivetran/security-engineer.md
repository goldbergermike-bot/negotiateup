### Security Engineer | Fivetran Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Equity + Compliance Bonus | Data Pipeline Security & AI Governance 2026

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland / Remote-US | $168K–$205K | $105K–$190K | 10–15% | $218K–$278K |
| Denver | $162K–$198K | $98K–$180K | 10–15% | $208K–$265K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Fivetran Security Engineers protect the data pipelines that move enterprise data across 500+ source systems — credentials management for thousands of database connections, data-in-transit security, and access controls for the most sensitive enterprise data operations. In February 2026, AI-powered features introduce new security challenges — ensuring AI models processing pipeline data don't expose credentials, that AI-generated connectors inherit proper security configurations, and that self-healing pipelines maintain security posture during automated remediation.

Fivetran's security compensation includes competitive equity with compliance bonuses. Security engineers who understand both traditional data pipeline security and AI-specific risks — particularly around credential management and automated system access at scale — command premium packages.

**Level Mapping:** Fivetran SecEng = Google L4 Security = Snowflake SecEng = Databricks Security = Datadog SecEng

### 🏗️ AI Pipeline Security & Credential Management Lever

In February 2026, Fivetran's AI features process and generate pipeline configurations that include access to customer databases and APIs — creating unique security challenges around credential exposure, automated access control, and AI-generated security configurations. Security Engineers who can build secure AI pipeline automation while maintaining SOC 2, HIPAA, and enterprise compliance are essential.

Your security architecture directly enables Fivetran to ship AI automation features to enterprise customers. Every security control you implement unblocks AI-generated connectors and self-healing pipelines while maintaining the trust that drives enterprise deal velocity.

**Global Levers**

1. **Credential Security at Scale:** "I'm securing 500+ connector credential stores and AI-automated access — the most sensitive data pipeline security challenge in the industry. This uniquely high-stakes work commands a premium."
2. **Enterprise Deal Enablement:** "Security compliance is a deal requirement for enterprise customers. SOC 2, HIPAA, and AI governance certifications directly drive revenue — my work has measurable deal impact."
3. **AI Security Specialization:** "I bring expertise in securing AI-automated systems — ensuring AI-generated connectors inherit proper security configurations. This emerging specialization is scarce and critical."
4. **Snowflake/Databricks Counter:** "I have security offers from Snowflake and Databricks with higher guaranteed comp. Fivetran's equity must be competitive given the multi-cloud credential security complexity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $185K equity over 4 years with a $200K base and 13% bonus target. I'm building the security framework for AI-automated data pipelines — securing 500+ connector credentials and AI-generated configurations. I have Snowflake and Databricks security offers with higher guaranteed comp. Fivetran's equity must reflect the enterprise trust premium." Accept if above $170K equity.
