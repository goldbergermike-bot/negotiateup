### 🏗️ AI-Automated Integration Architecture Lever

In February 2026, Fivetran's staff engineers are making the architectural decisions that determine whether AI-automated connector generation becomes viable at enterprise scale. These decisions — AI model architecture for connector generation, self-healing pipeline frameworks, intelligent orchestration systems — define the platform's capabilities for the next decade.

Your technical leadership defines the engineering culture and architectural standards for the entire organization. Every design decision compounds across dozens of engineers, hundreds of connectors, and 5,000+ enterprise customers.

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Architecture Ownership:** "I'm making the foundational architectural decisions for AI-automated data integration. These decisions compound across 500+ connectors and 5K+ enterprises — my equity must reflect this industry-wide impact."
2. **Google/Databricks Staff Counter:** "I have staff offers from Google and Databricks at $520K+ total comp. Fivetran's equity must be substantial to bridge the guaranteed comp gap with credible growth upside."
3. **Technical Leverage Multiplier:** "My architectural decisions affect every connector engineer, every connector, and every customer. This 10x+ multiplier on individual contribution is worth a significant premium."
4. **AI Automation Architecture:** "I've architected production AI automation systems at scale. This experience directly accelerates Fivetran's AI connector generation — saving millions in engineering effort."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $340K equity over 4 years with a $248K base and 15% bonus target. I'm architecting the AI-automated data integration platform — the decisions that determine whether Fivetran leads or follows in AI-powered pipelines. I have Google L6 and Databricks Staff offers at $530K+ guaranteed. Fivetran's equity must bridge this gap convincingly." Accept if above $312K equity.
