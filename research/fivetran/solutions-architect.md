**Negotiation DNA**

Fivetran Solutions Architects design enterprise data integration architectures — helping customers connect 500+ sources to cloud warehouses, configuring pipeline orchestration, and ensuring successful deployments across complex data ecosystems. In February 2026, SAs are increasingly responsible for helping enterprises adopt AI-powered pipeline features — configuring AI-automated connectors, setting up self-healing pipeline policies, and designing architectures that maximize the value of intelligent data observability.

Fivetran's SA compensation leans toward higher base salaries with performance bonuses tied to customer success and deal velocity. Solutions Architects who can articulate the AI automation value proposition and design implementations that showcase Fivetran's AI capabilities against Airbyte and cloud-native alternatives are driving enterprise growth.

**Level Mapping:** Fivetran SA = Google Cloud SA = Snowflake SA = Databricks SA = Informatica SA

### 🏗️ Enterprise AI Pipeline Adoption Lever

In February 2026, Fivetran's enterprise customers need guidance adopting AI-automated pipeline features — Solutions Architects who can design architectures showcasing AI connector generation, self-healing pipelines, and intelligent monitoring drive customer expansion and competitive wins against Airbyte.

Your implementation work directly impacts enterprise retention and expansion. Every successful AI pipeline deployment generates proof points that accelerate new enterprise sales and justify Fivetran's premium over open-source alternatives.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Implementation Expertise:** "I design the architectures that showcase Fivetran's AI pipeline automation to enterprise customers. My implementation work directly drives competitive wins — my bonus should reflect this revenue impact."
2. **Snowflake/Databricks SA Counter:** "I have SA offers from Snowflake and Databricks with higher base and more liquid equity. Fivetran's equity and bonus must be competitive."
3. **Data Integration Architecture:** "My enterprise data integration experience reduces implementation timelines by 40%+. Faster deployments drive faster expansion — this expertise warrants a premium."
4. **Competitive Win Impact:** "My implementations generate proof points against Airbyte and cloud-native services. The bonus structure should have a competitive displacement component."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $148K equity over 4 years with a $195K base and 18% bonus target tied to enterprise adoption. I'm designing the AI pipeline implementations that drive Fivetran's enterprise growth and competitive wins. I have Snowflake and Databricks SA offers with higher guaranteed comp. Fivetran's total package must be competitive." Accept if above $135K equity.
