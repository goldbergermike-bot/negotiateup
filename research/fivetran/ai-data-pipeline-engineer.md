**Negotiation DNA**

The AI Data Pipeline Engineer is Fivetran's signature hybrid role — sitting at the intersection of AI/ML engineering and data integration infrastructure. In February 2026, this role is responsible for building the systems that transform Fivetran from a manually-engineered connector platform into an AI-automated data integration engine. These engineers build the AI models that auto-generate connectors from API documentation, the ML systems that predict and prevent pipeline failures, and the intelligent frameworks that enable self-healing data pipelines. This requires deep understanding of both AI systems and the full complexity of data integration — API protocols, database internals, schema evolution, and data quality patterns.

Fivetran offers top-tier equity and signing bonuses for this role, recognizing that the intersection of AI engineering expertise and deep data integration knowledge is exceptionally rare. This is not a generic ML role applied to data — it requires engineers who can build AI systems that understand the nuances of REST APIs, JDBC connections, CDC streams, and hundreds of unique data source behaviors.

### 🏗️ AI-Automated Connector Generation Core Lever

In February 2026, the AI Data Pipeline Engineer role represents the most strategically important technical position at Fivetran. These engineers are building the AI systems that could expand Fivetran's connector coverage from 500+ to potentially thousands — by training models to read API documentation, understand authentication patterns, map schemas, and generate production-ready connector code automatically.

Your work defines whether Fivetran can achieve the scale advantage that makes AI-automated data integration a moat. Every model improvement in connector generation accuracy, every self-healing capability enhancement, and every predictive maintenance refinement directly strengthens Fivetran's position against Airbyte's open-source model and cloud-native integration services.

**Global Levers**

1. **Intersection Scarcity Premium:** "The intersection of AI/ML engineering and deep data integration expertise is the rarest skillset in the data infrastructure space. I bring both — my comp must reflect this market scarcity, not generic ML or integration benchmarks."
2. **Core Product Transformation:** "The AI connector generation system I build could 10x Fivetran's connector coverage. This isn't an incremental feature — it's a platform transformation. My equity must reflect the existential strategic importance."
3. **Snowflake/Databricks Counter:** "I have AI infrastructure offers from Snowflake and Databricks at $400K+ with liquid equity. Fivetran's equity must provide meaningful upside to compensate for the guaranteed comp gap."
4. **Signing Bonus Expectation:** "Given the competitive AI talent market and my transition from a liquid-equity company, I expect a $50K-$70K signing bonus as standard for this hybrid role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $280K equity over 4 years with a $228K base, 13% bonus, and $60K signing bonus. I'm building the AI connector generation system that could transform Fivetran's entire business model — from 500 manual connectors to thousands of AI-generated ones. I have Snowflake and Databricks AI offers at $415K+ with liquid equity. Fivetran's equity must make this bet mathematically compelling." Accept if above $262K equity.
