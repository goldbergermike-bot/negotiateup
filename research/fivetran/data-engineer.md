Fivetran Data Engineers build and maintain the automated data connectors and pipeline infrastructure that moves data from 500+ sources into data warehouses for over 5,000 enterprise customers. In February 2026, Fivetran is embedding AI throughout the pipeline platform — AI-powered connector generation, automated schema evolution, intelligent data quality monitoring, and LLM-driven pipeline debugging. Data Engineers who can build connectors that leverage AI for self-healing and auto-configuration are essential.

Fivetran's compensation includes strong equity grants reflecting the company's growth trajectory in the data integration market. As the leader in automated ELT, Fivetran competes with Airbyte, Stitch, and cloud-native integration services for data engineering talent.

### 🏗️ AI-Automated Connector Infrastructure Lever

In February 2026, Fivetran's AI capabilities are transforming data pipeline engineering — from manually coded connectors to AI-generated and self-maintaining integrations. Data Engineers building this AI-automated infrastructure enable Fivetran to scale connector coverage exponentially while reducing maintenance burden.

Your connector work directly impacts enterprise customers' data freshness and reliability. Every AI-enhanced connector you build and every self-healing pipeline you design reduces customer churn and drives platform expansion.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Pipeline Infrastructure:** "I'm building the AI-automated connector infrastructure that enables Fivetran to scale beyond 500+ connectors. My equity should reflect the growth this AI automation enables."
2. **Snowflake/Databricks Counter:** "I have offers from Snowflake and Databricks with larger equity grants. Fivetran's equity must be competitive given the AI pipeline infrastructure complexity I'll own."
3. **Connector Expertise Premium:** "Building reliable, self-healing data connectors at scale requires specialized expertise. My experience directly accelerates Fivetran's AI connector generation roadmap."
4. **Data Integration Market Growth:** "The data integration market is projected to reach $20B+ by 2028. I'm joining at the AI automation inflection — my equity should reflect this growth trajectory."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $190K equity over 4 years with a $195K base and 12% bonus target. I'm building the AI-automated connector infrastructure — Fivetran's core product innovation. I have Snowflake and Databricks offers with larger equity packages. Fivetran's equity must reflect the AI pipeline growth opportunity." Accept if above $175K equity.
