### Technical Program Manager | Fivetran Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Equity + Delivery Bonus | AI Pipeline Program Execution 2026

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland / Remote-US | $168K–$208K | $98K–$178K | 12–18% | $220K–$290K |
| Denver | $162K–$200K | $92K–$168K | 12–18% | $212K–$278K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Fivetran Technical Program Managers orchestrate the cross-functional programs that ship data pipeline features to 5,000+ enterprise customers — coordinating across connector engineering, platform infrastructure, data quality, product, and customer success teams. In February 2026, TPMs manage the complex AI automation programs — coordinating ML engineers building connector generators, platform engineers building self-healing frameworks, and customer success teams rolling out AI features to enterprises.

Fivetran's TPM compensation includes balanced equity and delivery bonuses tied to program milestones. TPMs who can manage both traditional connector development programs and AI/ML automation projects — with the unique challenge of shipping AI features while maintaining 500+ existing connector reliability — are in high demand.

**Level Mapping:** Fivetran TPM = Google L5 TPM = Snowflake TPM = Databricks TPM = Meta TPM IC5

### 🏗️ AI Automation Program Delivery Lever

In February 2026, Fivetran's AI automation programs are the most complex in the data integration space — requiring coordination across ML engineering, connector development, platform infrastructure, QA, and enterprise customer rollout. TPMs who can drive these programs to on-time delivery while maintaining the reliability of 500+ existing connectors determine Fivetran's competitive velocity.

Your program management directly impacts whether Fivetran ships AI automation before Airbyte and cloud-native competitors close the gap. Every risk you mitigate and every cross-team dependency you unblock accelerates the AI roadmap.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Program Complexity:** "I'm managing Fivetran's most complex AI automation programs — coordinating ML, connector engineering, and enterprise rollout simultaneously. This multi-dimensional TPM work commands a premium."
2. **Snowflake/Databricks TPM Counter:** "I have TPM offers from Snowflake and Databricks with higher guaranteed comp. Fivetran's equity and delivery bonus must make this growth-stage role compelling."
3. **Connector Scale Program Management:** "Managing programs across 500+ connectors with AI automation requires unique scale-aware program management. This expertise is rare in the TPM market."
4. **Shipping Velocity Impact:** "My programs ship 25%+ faster than average. For Fivetran racing to ship AI automation before competitors, my delivery track record is competitively critical."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like $172K equity over 4 years with a $205K base and 15% bonus tied to AI automation milestones. I'm orchestrating the programs that determine whether Fivetran leads in AI-automated data integration. I have Snowflake and Databricks TPM offers with higher guaranteed comp. Fivetran's equity and delivery bonus must reflect the program impact." Accept if above $158K equity.
