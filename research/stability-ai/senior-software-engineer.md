**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Stability AI own critical systems end-to-end — the API platform serving enterprise customers, the model hosting infrastructure, developer tools, and the product surfaces that monetize open-source AI. At a company navigating the unique business model of open-source AI, senior SWEs make architectural decisions that balance community accessibility with commercial viability.

**Level Mapping:** Stability AI Senior SWE = Google L5 = Meta E5 = UK Senior SWE top-tier

**The UK Market Context**
Push for top-of-market London compensation and use US benchmarks as leverage. Senior engineers at London AI companies should earn £120K+ base.

**Global Levers**
1. **Architecture Ownership:** "As a senior SWE, I'll own critical platform architecture decisions balancing open-source accessibility and commercial viability. That's Staff-level complexity: £150K base and £240K equity/4yr."
2. **UK AI Market Competition:** "DeepMind, Google, and Meta London all compete for senior engineers at £130K+ base. Stability needs to be competitive: £150K base."
3. **US Remote Premium:** "For US-remote, comparable roles pay $220K+ at AI startups. I need $230K base and $245K equity/4yr."
4. **Open-Source Business Model Expertise:** "Building commercially viable products around open-source models requires unique engineering judgment. I bring that expertise: £145K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a senior engineer passionate about open-source AI with experience building platforms at scale. Holding DeepMind London at £130K / £220K RSU. Stability's mission is compelling. For London: £150K base and £240K equity/4yr. For US-remote: $230K base and $240K equity/4yr. Floor for London: £125K."
