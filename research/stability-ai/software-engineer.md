### Software Engineer | Stability AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Startup Comp with UK Base + Pre-IPO Equity | $1B+ Valuation | London HQ | Open-Source Generative AI

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| London | £80K-£130K | £60K-£200K | — | £95K-£180K |
| San Francisco | $150K-$210K | $60K-$200K | — | $165K-$260K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Stability AI build the platforms and infrastructure that make open-source AI accessible — the API platform, the model hosting infrastructure, the developer tools, and the product interfaces that let millions of users interact with Stable Diffusion and other open models. Stability occupies a unique position in the AI landscape: a company committed to open-source that also needs to build commercial products. SWEs navigate this balance, building both community tools and enterprise-grade platforms.

**Level Mapping:** Stability AI SWE = Google L3-L4 = Meta E3-E4 = UK Startup Mid-Senior SWE

**The UK Market Context**
Stability's London HQ means many roles are UK-based, where tech salaries are lower than the US in absolute terms. However, UK-based roles should still be competitive within the London AI market. Use US AI startup benchmarks as leverage: "US-based AI startups pay $150K-$210K for comparable roles. While I understand the UK market adjustment, the equity should compensate for the base gap."

**Global Levers**
1. **Open-Source Platform Building:** "Building platforms for open-source AI requires unique engineering — supporting diverse hardware, managing community contributions, and building commercially viable products around free models. That dual expertise: £125K base and £190K equity/4yr."
2. **US Benchmark Leverage:** "Comparable roles at US AI startups pay $160K+ base. For a London role, I need £120K base minimum with equity that closes the total comp gap: £195K equity/4yr."
3. **Competing UK Tech Offers:** "DeepMind is offering me £110K base / £180K RSU. Google London at £100K / £200K RSU. Stability's open-source mission is compelling, but comp needs to be competitive: £125K base and £195K equity/4yr."
4. **US Remote Premium:** "If working remotely from the US, I need US-market compensation: $200K base and $195K equity/4yr."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a software engineer passionate about open-source AI and making powerful models accessible. I'm holding a DeepMind London offer at £110K / £180K RSU and a Google London offer at £100K / £200K RSU. Stability's mission is where I want to build. For London: £125K base and £190K equity/4yr with a £15K signing bonus. For US-remote: $200K base and $190K equity/4yr. Floor for London: £105K; for US: $175K."
