**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Stability AI manage the infrastructure for training and serving open-source AI models at scale — GPU clusters for model training, the API serving infrastructure, model distribution and hosting, and the CI/CD pipelines for model releases. Stability's open-source nature creates unique infrastructure challenges: models must be hosted and distributed to a massive global community, training runs compete with inference serving for GPU resources, and the infrastructure must support both commercial API customers and free open-source access.
