### ML/AI Engineer | Stability AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Startup Comp with UK Base + Pre-IPO Equity | $1B+ Valuation | London HQ | **+15-30% ML PREMIUM** | Open-Source Model Development

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| London | £100K-£170K | £80K-£265K | — | £120K-£236K |
| San Francisco | $180K-$270K | $85K-$300K | — | $201K-$345K |
| Remote US | $162K-$243K | $77K-$270K | — | $181K-$311K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Stability AI work directly on the models that define the open-source AI frontier — Stable Diffusion, Stable Video, Stable Audio, and next-generation architectures. You'll train models at scale, optimize architectures for both quality and efficiency, and build the evaluation systems that determine when a model is ready for open release. The +15-30% ML Premium reflects the extreme demand for engineers who can build state-of-the-art generative models. At Stability, ML engineers must also optimize models for consumer hardware — a unique constraint that requires deep understanding of model compression, quantization, and efficient inference.

**The Open-Source Mission Premium**
Many top ML engineers want to build open-source models. Use mission alignment, but don't accept below-market comp: "Open-source AI is my passion, but I need market-rate compensation."

**Global Levers**
1. **ML Premium (+15-30%):** "Generative AI ML engineers command a premium. I have direct experience with [diffusion models / model training / inference optimization]. For London: £165K base and £255K equity/4yr. For US: $265K base."
2. **Open-Source Model Impact:** "My models will be used by millions of developers worldwide — that community impact drives Stability's brand and ecosystem: £160K base."
3. **Competing AI Lab Offers:** "OpenAI offers $270K / $600K equity. DeepMind London offers £140K / £250K RSU. Stability needs to be competitive: £165K base and £260K equity/4yr for London."
4. **Consumer Hardware Optimization:** "Model compression and optimization for consumer GPUs is critical for the open-source mission. That expertise is rare: £165K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm an ML engineer committed to open-source AI with deep generative model experience. Holding OpenAI at $270K / $600K equity and DeepMind London at £140K / £250K RSU. For London: £165K base and £255K equity/4yr. For US: $265K base and $295K equity/4yr. ML Premium applies. Floor for London: £135K."
