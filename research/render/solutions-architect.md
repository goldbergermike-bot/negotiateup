#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Render

Render is a private startup headquartered in San Francisco building a modern cloud platform designed as the successor to Heroku. The platform provides web services, static sites, background workers, cron jobs, managed PostgreSQL, Redis, and private networking — all deployed directly from Git with zero-configuration.

Solutions Architects at Render are the technical bridge between the platform and its customers. They design deployment architectures for complex applications, guide migrations from Heroku, AWS, and other platforms, and help enterprise customers adopt Render for production workloads. At a startup, this role is both pre-sales and post-sales — SAs close deals by proving technical feasibility and ensure successful adoption.

This role requires a rare combination of deep cloud infrastructure knowledge, customer-facing communication skills, and the ability to translate between customer requirements and platform capabilities. Solutions Architects also serve as the voice of the customer internally, feeding technical requirements back to engineering and product teams.

As Render grows its enterprise customer base, Solutions Architects directly drive revenue by enabling larger, more complex deployments and facilitating migrations from competitors. Each successful enterprise migration represents significant recurring revenue.
