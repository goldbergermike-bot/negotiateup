### Software Engineer | MongoDB Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + No Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | Voyage AI Acquisition Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $150K–$185K | $120K–$200K | — | $180K–$235K |
| Dublin | €62K–€80K | €50K–€85K | — | €75K–$105K |
| Austin | $140K–$175K | $110K–$185K | — | $168K–$220K |

**Negotiation DNA**

MongoDB is no longer just a database company — with the January 2026 Voyage AI acquisition, MongoDB is making a direct play to become THE AI data layer. Voyage AI's embedding models integrated natively into Atlas Vector Search mean MongoDB now owns the full stack: document storage, vector embeddings, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) infrastructure. Every AI application needs a data layer, and MongoDB is positioning Atlas as that default. The comp model is equity-heavy with no annual bonus — all your negotiation leverage goes into RSU grants. MongoDB's stock has been volatile but the AI data layer narrative is driving renewed investor confidence. [Source: MongoDB SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Data Layer Positioning:** "MongoDB isn't just a database — with Voyage AI, it's becoming the default AI data layer. Every RAG application, every AI agent, every LLM deployment needs vector search + document storage. I'm building the infrastructure for the AI economy."
2. **Voyage AI Integration = Revenue Catalyst:** "The Voyage AI acquisition (Jan 2026) means MongoDB now owns embedding models + vector search natively in Atlas. I'll be integrating these capabilities — every feature I ship accelerates the AI data layer revenue story."
3. **Atlas Cloud Revenue Growth:** "MongoDB Atlas is the growth engine — cloud revenue growing 30%+ YoY. Every engineering improvement to Atlas performance, reliability, and developer experience directly drives consumption revenue."
4. **Push Hard on Equity — No Bonus Means One Lever:** With no annual bonus, all your negotiation leverage is in RSUs. Push for 25-30% more equity on the initial offer — MongoDB expects negotiation on this single lever.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I appreciate the initial offer of $[X] in RSUs. With no bonus component, the equity is the primary comp lever. Based on competing offers from [Elastic/Databricks] and the Voyage AI integration work ahead, I'd like to see the RSU grant increased to $190K over 4 years. MongoDB's AI data layer opportunity is compelling, but the equity needs to reflect the revenue impact of the work I'll deliver." MongoDB will counter at $165K-$185K RSUs — accept at $175K+.
