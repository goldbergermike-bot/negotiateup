### Security Engineer | MongoDB Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + No Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | Voyage AI Acquisition Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $180K–$222K | $190K–$315K | — | $228K–$300K |
| Dublin | €78K–€100K | €78K–€130K | — | €97K–€133K |
| Austin | $170K–$212K | $175K–$290K | — | $214K–$285K |

**Negotiation DNA**

MongoDB Security Engineers protect the data layer for enterprises that trust Atlas with their most sensitive data — financial records, healthcare information, customer PII, and now AI embeddings containing semantic representations of that data. The Voyage AI acquisition introduces new security challenges: embedding model security, vector data privacy, and AI-specific attack vectors (prompt injection via embeddings, data poisoning, model extraction). MongoDB has invested heavily in security certifications (SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP) because enterprise trust IS the business. Security engineers who understand both database security and AI/ML security are exceptionally rare. No-bonus comp means equity is the lever. [Source: MongoDB Security Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Data Layer Security — New Attack Surface:** "The Voyage AI integration creates entirely new security challenges: embedding model security, vector data privacy, AI-specific attack vectors. I bring database security AND AI security expertise — that intersection is extremely rare."
2. **Enterprise Trust = Revenue:** "MongoDB Atlas handles the most sensitive enterprise data. Every security certification I maintain (SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP) unlocks new enterprise segments. My security work directly enables revenue."
3. **Multi-Cloud Security Posture:** "Securing Atlas across AWS, GCP, and Azure simultaneously requires deep multi-cloud security expertise. Each cloud has different security primitives — I build a unified security posture across all three."
4. **No-Bonus Equity Push — Security Scarcity:** Security talent with database + AI expertise is the scarcest hiring segment. Push for 30% more RSUs: "I'm securing the AI data layer — a new attack surface that most security engineers don't understand. That scarcity justifies above-band equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a security role protecting MongoDB's AI data layer — database security, embedding model security, and AI-specific attack vectors across three clouds — I'm targeting $300K in RSUs over 4 years. Security engineers with AI + database expertise are extremely rare. I have competing security offers from [CrowdStrike/Snowflake] with bonus components." MongoDB will counter at $265K-$295K RSUs — accept at $275K+.
