**Negotiation DNA**

MongoDB EMs lead teams building the products that will define whether MongoDB wins the "Battle for the AI Data Layer." You might manage the Atlas Vector Search team (integrating Voyage AI), the core query engine team, the replication/sharding infrastructure team, or the developer experience team. The Voyage AI acquisition means MongoDB needs EMs who can integrate an acquired team (Voyage AI engineers) with existing MongoDB engineering culture — M&A integration management is a rare skill worth a premium. No-bonus comp means all leverage goes into equity. MongoDB's Dev Day events and community-driven GTM mean your team's developer experience work has direct revenue impact.

**Level Mapping:** MongoDB EM = Google L5 Manager = Meta M1 = Elastic EM = Confluent EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Voyage AI Team Integration:** "I'll integrate the acquired Voyage AI engineering team into MongoDB's culture and processes. M&A engineering integration is a rare management skill — the success of the AI data layer strategy depends on how well Voyage AI engineers are onboarded and retained."
2. **AI Data Layer Team Building:** "I'm building and scaling the team that delivers MongoDB's AI data layer capabilities. Recruiting ML engineers and vector search specialists into a database company requires a specific recruiting narrative and management approach."
3. **Developer Community = Revenue Pipeline:** "MongoDB's developer community (2M+ monthly active devs on Atlas) is the revenue pipeline. My team's work on developer experience directly drives Atlas adoption and consumption."
4. **No-Bonus Equity Push:** Push for 25-30% more RSUs. With no bonus lever, frame: "The equity needs to do the work of both equity and bonus. I need $420K RSUs to match the total comp of offers that include 15-20% bonuses."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an EM role leading the [Atlas Vector Search/Core Engine] team during MongoDB's most critical strategic transition — integrating Voyage AI and building the AI data layer — I'm targeting $420K in RSUs over 4 years. I'll be integrating an acquired team, recruiting ML talent, and scaling a team whose work defines MongoDB's competitive position. I have competing EM offers with 15-20% bonuses that make their total comp more predictable." MongoDB will counter at $370K-$410K RSUs — accept at $390K+.
