### Data Scientist | MongoDB Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + No Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | Voyage AI Acquisition Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $170K–$210K | $175K–$290K | — | $215K–$285K |
| Dublin | €72K–€92K | €70K–€120K | — | €90K–€122K |
| Austin | $160K–$200K | $160K–$270K | — | $200K–$270K |

**Negotiation DNA**

MongoDB Data Scientists work at the intersection of database intelligence and AI — building the models that power Atlas's performance optimization, query recommendation, index suggestion, workload analysis, and now the Voyage AI embedding quality and retrieval relevance systems. The Voyage AI acquisition makes this role uniquely valuable: you're not just building data science for a database company, you're optimizing the embedding models and retrieval algorithms that define MongoDB's AI data layer product quality. MongoDB's dataset of 2M+ developer workloads is a proprietary training corpus for database-aware ML models. No-bonus comp means equity is the primary lever. [Source: MongoDB DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** MongoDB Senior DS = Google L4 DS = Elastic Senior DS = Snowflake Senior DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Voyage AI Embedding Optimization:** "With the Voyage AI acquisition, I'll optimize embedding model quality and retrieval relevance for Atlas Vector Search. My work directly determines whether MongoDB's AI data layer delivers competitive retrieval quality against purpose-built vector databases."
2. **Proprietary Workload Data:** "MongoDB has usage data from 2M+ monthly active developers — query patterns, index usage, performance bottlenecks. This proprietary dataset enables database-aware ML models that no competitor can build."
3. **Atlas Intelligence = Revenue:** "Every ML-powered optimization I build — auto-indexing, query recommendations, performance predictions — increases Atlas reliability and reduces customer churn. My models directly protect and grow $1.9B in ARR."
4. **No-Bonus Equity Push:** Push for 25% more RSUs. Frame the Voyage AI overlap: "I'm doing the DS work that makes the Voyage AI acquisition successful — embedding optimization and retrieval relevance. That AI integration work commands a premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a Data Science role optimizing Voyage AI embeddings and building Atlas intelligence on MongoDB's proprietary dataset of 2M+ developer workloads, I'm targeting $275K in RSUs over 4 years. My work directly determines whether MongoDB's AI data layer competes on retrieval quality. I have competing DS offers from [Elastic ESRE/Databricks Mosaic ML] with bonus components." MongoDB will counter at $240K-$270K RSUs — accept at $255K+.
