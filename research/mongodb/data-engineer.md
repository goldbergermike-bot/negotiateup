### Data Engineer | MongoDB Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + No Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | Voyage AI Acquisition Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $165K–$205K | $165K–$275K | — | $206K–$275K |
| Dublin | €70K–€90K | €65K–€112K | — | €86K–€118K |
| Austin | $155K–$195K | $150K–$255K | — | $193K–$260K |

**Negotiation DNA**

MongoDB Data Engineers build the data infrastructure that powers Atlas's internal analytics, customer-facing data products, and the emerging AI data pipeline capabilities (Atlas Stream Processing, Atlas Data Federation, Change Streams). With the Voyage AI acquisition, there's a new data engineering challenge: building the data pipelines that feed embedding model training, serve vectors at low latency, and maintain the quality of the AI data layer. MongoDB's position is unique: you're a data engineer AT a database company — building the meta-data-layer that makes MongoDB's own data products work. No-bonus comp means equity is the lever.

**Level Mapping:** MongoDB Senior DE = Google L4 DE = Elastic Senior DE = Confluent Senior DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Meta-Data Engineering — Data Infrastructure for a Database Company:** "I'm building data infrastructure at a database company — the meta-data-layer that powers Atlas analytics, customer usage insights, and AI model training pipelines. This is a uniquely recursive engineering challenge."
2. **Voyage AI Training Pipelines:** "The Voyage AI integration requires data pipelines that feed embedding model training at scale. I'm building the data infrastructure that determines the quality of MongoDB's AI data layer products."
3. **Atlas Stream Processing:** "Atlas Stream Processing is MongoDB's real-time data pipeline product — competing with Confluent and Databricks. My data engineering work builds the product that customers use for their own data engineering."
4. **No-Bonus Equity Push:** Push for 25% more RSUs. Frame the AI pipeline work: "I'm building the data pipelines that make Voyage AI successful — training data quality, embedding freshness, vector serving reliability. That AI infrastructure work justifies above-band equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a data engineering role building AI model training pipelines for Voyage AI AND Atlas's internal data infrastructure, I'm targeting $260K in RSUs over 4 years. I'm the data foundation that makes MongoDB's AI data layer products work. I have competing DE offers from [Databricks/Snowflake] with bonus components and [Databricks] pre-IPO equity." MongoDB will counter at $230K-$255K RSUs — accept at $240K+.
