### DevOps / Platform Engineer | MongoDB Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + No Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | Voyage AI Acquisition Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $170K–$210K | $170K–$280K | — | $213K–$280K |
| Dublin | €72K–€92K | €68K–€115K | — | €90K–€120K |
| Austin | $160K–$200K | $155K–$260K | — | $200K–$265K |

**Negotiation DNA**

MongoDB Platform Engineers build the infrastructure that runs Atlas across all three major clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure) — the multi-cloud Kubernetes orchestration, database-as-a-service provisioning, automated scaling, backup/restore systems, and now the GPU compute infrastructure required for Voyage AI embedding model serving. Atlas is MongoDB's growth engine ($1.9B+ ARR), and platform engineers ensure it scales reliably while maintaining the multi-cloud flexibility that enterprises demand. The Voyage AI acquisition adds a new infrastructure dimension: serving ML models at low latency alongside database operations. No-bonus comp means equity is the lever.

**Level Mapping:** MongoDB Senior Platform Eng = Google L4 SRE = Elastic Senior Platform Eng = Confluent Senior Platform Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Cloud Atlas Infrastructure:** "I'm building the multi-cloud Kubernetes infrastructure that runs Atlas across AWS, GCP, and Azure simultaneously. This is database-as-a-service at a scale that serves 2M+ developers — multi-cloud reliability is my direct responsibility."
2. **GPU Infrastructure for Voyage AI:** "The Voyage AI acquisition means MongoDB now needs GPU compute infrastructure for embedding model serving. I'm building the ML serving layer alongside the database infrastructure — a new platform engineering challenge."
3. **Atlas Reliability = Revenue:** "Every minute of Atlas downtime or degradation directly impacts $1.9B in ARR. My platform engineering work protects MongoDB's revenue and enables the reliability SLAs that enterprise customers demand."
4. **No-Bonus Equity Push:** Push for 25% more RSUs. Frame: "Platform engineers are the foundation of Atlas reliability. With no bonus, I need $265K in RSUs to match competing offers that include bonuses. Atlas can't grow without reliable infrastructure."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a platform engineering role building multi-cloud Atlas infrastructure AND the new GPU serving layer for Voyage AI, I'm targeting $265K in RSUs over 4 years. I'm building the reliability foundation for $1.9B in ARR while adding ML infrastructure capabilities. I have competing platform offers from [Elastic/Snowflake] with bonus components." MongoDB will counter at $235K-$260K RSUs — accept at $245K+.
