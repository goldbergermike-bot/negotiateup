### Voyage AI Search Engineer | MongoDB Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + No Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+20–35% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $195K–$242K | $240K–$400K | — | $255K–$342K |
| Dublin | €85K–€112K | €98K–€165K | — | €110K–€153K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is MongoDB's signature role for 2026 — the Voyage AI Search Engineer. You're building the technology that MongoDB acquired for $200M+ in January 2026: the Voyage AI embedding models, Atlas Vector Search ranking algorithms, hybrid document + vector retrieval systems, and the RAG-as-a-service infrastructure that will define MongoDB's next decade. This role didn't exist at MongoDB before the acquisition — and it doesn't exist at any other database company in this form because no other database company owns its own embedding model technology. You're not integrating a third-party vector database; you're building a native AI data layer from the ground up, with embedding models that are trained specifically for MongoDB's document-oriented data model.

**Level Mapping:** MongoDB Voyage AI Search Eng (Senior) = Elastic ESRE Engineer = Google L4-L5 Search Infrastructure = Pinecone Senior Eng

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Voyage AI Search Engineer works at the intersection of ML, information retrieval, and distributed database systems:
- **Voyage AI Embedding Models:** The proprietary embedding models that MongoDB acquired — trained for retrieval quality across code, text, multimodal content, and now MongoDB's document-oriented data
- **Atlas Vector Search:** The native vector search engine integrated into Atlas — no separate vector database required, no data movement, ACID guarantees on vectors alongside documents
- **Hybrid Retrieval:** The retrieval algorithms that combine vector similarity search with MongoDB's traditional document query capabilities — enabling hybrid search that no purpose-built vector database can match
- **RAG Infrastructure:** The server-side RAG pipeline infrastructure that lets developers build AI applications without managing embedding, chunking, and retrieval separately
- **Document-Aware Embeddings:** Training embedding models that understand MongoDB's document structure — nested documents, arrays, mixed types — producing embeddings that capture document semantics better than generic models

**Global Levers**

1. **$200M+ Acquisition — You ARE the Investment:** "MongoDB acquired Voyage AI for $200M+ to build this team. I'm not applying for an open headcount — I'm joining the team that justifies a $200M+ strategic acquisition. That acquisition premium should be reflected in my comp."
2. **Embedding-Native Database — Category Creation:** "No other database company owns its own embedding models. I'm building a new product category: the embedding-native database. This is category-creating work that defines MongoDB's competitive position for the next decade."
3. **Hybrid Retrieval — MongoDB's Structural Advantage:** "Purpose-built vector databases can't do hybrid document + vector retrieval with ACID guarantees. My work on hybrid retrieval algorithms is the feature that makes MongoDB's AI data layer structurally superior to Pinecone + Postgres."
4. **Document-Aware Embeddings — Technical Moat:** "I'm training embedding models that understand MongoDB's document structure — nested documents, arrays, mixed types. These document-aware embeddings are a technical moat that generic embedding providers can't replicate."
5. **Agentic AI Premium (20-35%):** If building autonomous retrieval agents or self-optimizing search systems, push for the full agentic premium: "I'm building AI systems that autonomously optimize retrieval quality — self-tuning embeddings, adaptive ranking, and intelligent index management."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $380K in RSUs over 4 years for this Voyage AI Search Engineer role. I'm building the technology that justifies MongoDB's $200M+ acquisition — embedding-native vector search that creates a new product category. This role doesn't exist at any other database company. I have an Elastic ESRE offer at $350K RSUs with bonus, and a Pinecone senior offer at $400K total. MongoDB's embedding-native strategy is the most technically interesting, but the equity needs to reflect that I'm the ROI on a $200M+ acquisition." MongoDB will counter at $340K-$375K RSUs — accept at $355K+. This is the role that determines whether MongoDB's biggest acquisition in company history succeeds or fails.
