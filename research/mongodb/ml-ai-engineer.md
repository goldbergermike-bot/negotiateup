### ML/AI Engineer | MongoDB Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + No Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | **+20–35% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM** | Voyage AI Acquisition Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $190K–$235K | $230K–$380K | — | $248K–$330K |
| Dublin | €82K–€108K | €95K–€155K | — | €106K–€147K |
| Austin | $180K–$225K | $210K–$350K | — | $233K–$312K |

**Negotiation DNA**

MongoDB ML/AI Engineers are at the epicenter of the "Battle for the AI Data Layer." With the Voyage AI acquisition (Jan 2026), MongoDB now has an in-house ML team building embedding models, vector search algorithms, and retrieval-augmented generation infrastructure. You're not building ML models that sit on TOP of a database — you're building ML that IS the database product. Atlas Vector Search quality, Voyage AI embedding relevance, semantic search ranking, and AI-powered database optimization are all ML engineering products. The Agentic AI Premium (20-35%) applies because you're building the autonomous AI agents that power database auto-optimization and intelligent retrieval. This is the most strategically important engineering role at MongoDB in 2026. No-bonus comp means equity is the only lever — push hard. [Source: MongoDB ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** MongoDB Senior ML Eng = Google L4 ML = Elastic Senior ML (ESRE) = Snowflake Senior ML (Cortex)

**Global Levers**

1. **Voyage AI — Owning the Embedding Stack:** "I'll work on the Voyage AI embedding models — the core technology MongoDB acquired for $200M+. My ML engineering work directly determines whether MongoDB's AI data layer competes with OpenAI embeddings, Cohere, and purpose-built vector databases."
2. **ML IS the Product:** "At MongoDB, ML isn't a supporting function — it IS the product. Atlas Vector Search quality, embedding relevance, semantic search ranking — these are ML engineering outputs that customers pay for directly."
3. **Agentic AI Premium (20-35%):** "I'm building autonomous AI agents for database optimization — auto-indexing, query optimization, workload prediction, and intelligent scaling that act without human intervention. This is agentic AI applied to infrastructure."
4. **No-Bonus + AI Scarcity = Maximum Equity Push:** ML engineers who understand both embedding models AND database internals are the rarest talent segment. Push for 35-40% more RSUs: "With no bonus and the scarcest skill combination in the industry, I need $360K in RSUs to justify choosing MongoDB over Databricks pre-IPO or Snowflake liquid equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an ML/AI role building Voyage AI embedding models and Atlas Vector Search — the products that define whether MongoDB wins the AI data layer war — I'm targeting $360K in RSUs over 4 years with the 20-35% Agentic AI Premium. I have a Databricks Mosaic ML offer with pre-IPO equity at $450K and a Snowflake Cortex AI offer at $380K liquid RSUs. MongoDB's embedding-native strategy is the most compelling ML opportunity, but the equity needs to match the strategic importance." MongoDB will counter at $320K-$350K RSUs — accept at $335K+. This is the role that determines whether MongoDB's $200M+ Voyage AI acquisition succeeds.
