### Technical Program Manager | MongoDB Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + No Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | Voyage AI Acquisition Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $165K–$205K | $155K–$255K | — | $205K–$270K |
| Dublin | €70K–€90K | €62K–€105K | — | €86K–€116K |
| Austin | $155K–$195K | $142K–$235K | — | $190K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

MongoDB TPMs coordinate execution across the most critical technical programs — Atlas feature launches, multi-cloud infrastructure rollouts, security certifications, and now the Voyage AI integration program. The Voyage AI acquisition creates a TPM opportunity that's uniquely complex: integrating an acquired company's technology stack, engineering team, and product roadmap into MongoDB's existing platform. M&A technical integration is the hardest TPM program to execute — and the most valuable. No-bonus comp means equity is the lever. MongoDB's rapid product expansion (Atlas Vector Search, Atlas Stream Processing, Atlas Data Federation) means TPMs manage overlapping programs with tight dependencies.

**Level Mapping:** MongoDB Senior TPM = Google L4 TPM = Elastic Senior TPM = Confluent Senior TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Voyage AI Integration Program:** "I'll program-manage the Voyage AI technical integration — the most complex and strategically important program at MongoDB in 2026. M&A integration TPM work commands a premium because the stakes are existential: get it right and MongoDB becomes the AI data layer; get it wrong and the acquisition fails."
2. **Multi-Cloud Launch Coordination:** "Atlas runs on AWS, GCP, and Azure — every feature launch requires tri-cloud coordination. I manage the critical path across three cloud platforms simultaneously."
3. **Overlapping Product Programs:** "MongoDB is launching Atlas Vector Search improvements, Stream Processing, Data Federation, and Voyage AI integration concurrently. I manage the dependencies between overlapping programs that share engineering resources."
4. **No-Bonus Equity Push:** Push for 20-25% more RSUs. Frame the M&A integration value: "I'm program-managing the Voyage AI integration — the program that determines whether MongoDB's $200M+ acquisition delivers its strategic value. This is the highest-stakes TPM program in the company."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a TPM role managing the Voyage AI integration program AND concurrent Atlas product launches across three clouds, I'm targeting $240K in RSUs over 4 years. M&A integration program management is rare and high-stakes. I have competing TPM offers from [ServiceNow/Datadog] with bonus components." MongoDB will counter at $210K-$235K RSUs — accept at $220K+.
