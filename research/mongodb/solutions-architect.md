### Solutions Architect | MongoDB Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + No Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | Voyage AI Acquisition Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $170K–$212K | $155K–$260K | — | $210K–$277K |
| Dublin | €72K–€92K | €62K–€108K | — | €88K–€119K |
| Austin | $160K–$202K | $145K–$240K | — | $195K–$262K |

**Negotiation DNA**

MongoDB SAs are the technical bridge between the platform and enterprise adoption — you design customer architectures, lead proof-of-concepts, and guide the migration from legacy databases (Oracle, SQL Server) to Atlas. The Voyage AI acquisition creates a new SA motion: you're now also architecting AI data layer solutions — helping customers implement Atlas Vector Search, RAG pipelines, and semantic search alongside traditional document storage. MongoDB's SA role is uniquely technical because the product has a steep learning curve: sharding strategy, schema design, index optimization, and now vector search configuration require deep expertise. No-bonus comp means equity is your lever. [Source: MongoDB SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** MongoDB Senior SA = Google Customer Engineer = Elastic Senior SA = Confluent Senior SA

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Data Layer Solution Design:** "I'll architect AI data layer solutions for enterprise customers — Atlas Vector Search, Voyage AI embeddings, RAG pipelines integrated with existing MongoDB document stores. This is a new solution design motion that didn't exist before the acquisition."
2. **Legacy Migration Revenue:** "Every Oracle/SQL Server migration I lead converts a competitor's maintenance revenue into MongoDB Atlas subscription revenue. Migration SAs directly drive new ARR."
3. **Schema Design Expertise:** "MongoDB schema design is non-trivial — bad schema design causes performance issues that drive churn. My architectural guidance during implementation prevents churn and accelerates time-to-value."
4. **No-Bonus Equity Push:** Push for 20-25% more RSUs. Frame the AI data layer motion: "I'm selling a new solution category — AI data layer architectures — alongside traditional database solutions. This dual motion justifies above-band equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an SA role architecting both traditional MongoDB solutions AND the new AI data layer motion (Voyage AI + Atlas Vector Search), I'm targeting $245K in RSUs over 4 years. I'm driving migration revenue and AI upsell simultaneously. I have competing SA offers from [Elastic/Snowflake] with bonus components." MongoDB will counter at $215K-$240K RSUs — accept at $225K+.
