**Negotiation DNA**

Square Data Engineers build the data infrastructure powering analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence across Square's commerce platform — processing, transforming, and serving data from billions of transactions across 56M+ sellers. At the DE2-DE3 level within Block's $45B+ ecosystem, you own data pipelines, warehouse architecture, ETL systems, and real-time streaming infrastructure that feeds every data-driven decision at Square. With Square's 2026 AI-powered commerce initiative, Data Engineers now build the data pipelines that power intelligent seller tools — real-time feature stores, ML training datasets, and the data infrastructure that enables AI-driven pricing, demand forecasting, and automated marketing at scale. Block RSUs with NYSE liquidity reward data engineers who build the data foundation of AI-powered commerce. [Source: Square DE Comp 2025-2026]

### 🏗️ Square AI-Powered Commerce Tools Lever
As a Data Engineer during Square's AI commerce transformation, you build the data infrastructure that powers every AI feature — real-time feature stores that serve ML models, training data pipelines that feed model development, and analytics infrastructure that measures AI tool effectiveness across 56M+ sellers.

Without your data pipelines, AI-powered commerce tools cannot function. Every intelligent recommendation, demand forecast, and pricing optimization depends on data that flows through infrastructure you build and maintain.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Commerce Data Infrastructure:** "I build the data pipelines powering AI-driven commerce tools for 56M+ sellers. My feature stores, ML training pipelines, and real-time data infrastructure are the foundation of every intelligent seller tool — this foundational ownership commands premium DE compensation."
2. **Commerce Data Scale:** "I build data infrastructure processing billions of commerce transactions across 56M+ sellers. The scale, reliability, and latency requirements of Square's data systems rival the most demanding data engineering environments in tech."
3. **Stripe/Shopify DE Competition:** "Stripe and Shopify offer $310K+ TC for Data Engineers building AI commerce data infrastructure. Square must match competitive compensation to retain data engineers who build the pipelines powering intelligent seller tools."
4. **ML Pipeline Architecture:** "I design the ML data pipelines that enable AI-powered commerce features — real-time feature stores, training data curation, and model serving infrastructure. Data Engineers who can build ML-ready data infrastructure are scarce and command premium comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $212K base and $255K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Data Engineer role. I build the data infrastructure powering AI-driven commerce tools for 56M+ sellers — feature stores, ML training pipelines, and real-time analytics serving intelligent recommendations at scale. I have competing offers from [Stripe at $310K TC / Shopify at $302K TC / Toast at $288K TC]. Data Engineers who build ML-ready commerce data infrastructure are the foundation of the AI transformation." Accept at $188K+ base and $215K+ RSUs.
