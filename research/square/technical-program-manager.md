### 🏗️ Square AI-Powered Commerce Tools Lever
As a Technical Program Manager during Square's AI commerce transformation, you manage the cross-functional programs that deliver intelligent seller tools. You coordinate ML engineers building models, platform engineers building serving infrastructure, product managers defining requirements, and designers crafting experiences — orchestrating the most complex product initiative in Square's history.

Your program management directly determines whether AI-powered commerce tools ship on time, at quality, and with the cross-team coordination required for ML product launches. This is program management at the intersection of AI and commerce.
