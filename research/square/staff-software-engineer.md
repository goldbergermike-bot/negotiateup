### 🏗️ Square AI-Powered Commerce Tools Lever
As a Staff Software Engineer, you define the platform-level architecture for Square's AI commerce transformation — designing the shared infrastructure, ML serving platforms, and data pipelines that enable every team to build intelligent seller tools. Your decisions set the technical strategy for how AI is embedded across Square's entire product surface.

You own the hardest cross-cutting technical challenges: real-time ML inference at commerce scale, feature stores for seller intelligence, and the abstraction layers that let product teams ship AI features without deep ML expertise. This is platform-defining work.
