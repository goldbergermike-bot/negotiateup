Square Product Managers define the product strategy for commerce tools that empower 56M+ sellers — shaping what gets built, how features are prioritized, and how AI-powered capabilities reach businesses of every size across Square's ecosystem. At the PM2-PM3 level within Block's $45B+ ecosystem, you own product areas spanning payments, seller tools, inventory management, and commerce APIs. With Square's 2026 AI-powered commerce initiative, Product Managers define how AI features are packaged, priced, and delivered to sellers — crafting the product experience that makes enterprise-level intelligence accessible to small businesses. Block RSUs with NYSE liquidity reward PMs who ship products that expand Square's seller ecosystem. [Source: Square PM Comp 2025-2026]
