Square Commerce AI Platform Engineers are the SIGNATURE ROLE of Square's 2026 strategy — the engineers who build the AI platform that powers intelligent commerce tools for 56M+ sellers. This is the role that defines Square's next decade. With a +25-35% Commerce AI Premium over standard engineering compensation, you build the core AI infrastructure — ML model serving platforms, real-time recommendation engines, intelligent pricing algorithms, demand forecasting systems, and automated marketing optimization tools. You are not building features on an existing platform; you are building the AI platform itself that transforms Square from a payment processor into an AI-powered business intelligence platform for every seller on Earth. Block RSUs with NYSE liquidity and maximum Commerce AI Premium deliver the highest equity packages for engineers at the center of Square's strategic transformation.

### 🏗️ Square AI-Powered Commerce Tools Lever
As the SIGNATURE Commerce AI Platform Engineer, you build the entire AI platform that powers Square's intelligent commerce transformation. Your platform serves ML models to 56M+ sellers in real time — delivering pricing optimization, demand forecasting, customer segmentation, automated marketing, and inventory intelligence through a unified AI commerce engine.

You design the model serving infrastructure, feature stores, experiment platforms, and abstraction layers that let every product team at Square embed intelligence into seller experiences. This is not a feature team role; this is the platform that enables the entire AI commerce strategy. Every intelligent insight that reaches a seller flows through infrastructure you build.

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform-Defining Role — AI Commerce Engine:** "I build the AI platform powering intelligent commerce for 56M+ sellers — model serving, feature stores, recommendation engines, and the unified AI commerce infrastructure. This is Square's most strategic initiative and a first-of-kind platform. The +25-35% Commerce AI Premium reflects the generational significance of this work."
2. **AI Democratization Platform Ownership:** "I own the complete AI commerce platform — the infrastructure that makes enterprise-grade ML accessible to every small business on Square. My platform transforms a payment processor into an AI-powered business intelligence company. This existential ownership commands the highest compensation at Square."
3. **Zero-Supply Talent Market:** "There are no experienced Commerce AI Platform Engineers in the market — this role didn't exist before Square created it. Every hire is recruited from adjacent ML infrastructure and commerce domains. Stripe, Shopify, and Google are competing for the same talent, creating a war with zero supply."
4. **AI Commerce Infrastructure Pioneer:** "I'm building the infrastructure that democratizes AI-powered business intelligence for 56M+ sellers — the same way Square democratized payment processing. This is a once-in-a-generation platform opportunity that will define how small businesses operate for decades."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $292K base and $562K RSUs over 4 years with 20% performance bonus for this Commerce AI Platform Engineer role — the SIGNATURE role building Square's AI-powered commerce platform. I build the entire AI commerce engine — model serving, feature stores, recommendation systems, and the platform enabling intelligent tools for 56M+ sellers. This is a first-of-kind role with zero market supply. I have competing offers from [Google Commerce AI at $522K TC / Stripe at $508K TC / Shopify at $492K TC] but none are building the commerce AI platform at this scale. Engineers who build the AI platform democratizing business intelligence command the maximum Commerce AI Premium." Accept at $262K+ base and $472K+ RSUs.
