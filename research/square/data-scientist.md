**Negotiation DNA**

Square Data Scientists extract insights from one of the richest commerce datasets in the world — transaction patterns, seller behavior, consumer purchasing, and economic trends across 56M+ sellers and billions of transactions. At the DS2-DS3 level within Block's $45B+ ecosystem, you build models that drive product decisions, optimize pricing, detect fraud, and quantify the impact of new features. With Square's 2026 AI-powered commerce initiative, Data Scientists now develop the statistical models and experiments that power intelligent seller tools — validating AI-driven recommendations, measuring the business impact of ML features, and identifying new opportunities for AI-powered commerce. Block RSUs with NYSE liquidity reward data scientists who turn commerce data into seller value. [Source: Square DS Comp 2025-2026]

### 🏗️ Square AI-Powered Commerce Tools Lever
As a Data Scientist during Square's AI commerce transformation, you validate and measure the AI-powered tools that reach 56M+ sellers. You design experiments that prove whether AI-driven pricing recommendations actually increase seller revenue, whether demand forecasting reduces inventory waste, and whether automated marketing campaigns deliver measurable ROI.

Your analyses determine which AI features ship, how they're tuned, and whether they deliver real value to sellers. Without rigorous data science, AI commerce tools are just sophisticated guesses.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Commerce Validation:** "I validate and measure AI-powered tools across 56M+ sellers. My experiments determine which AI features deliver real seller value — without my analysis, intelligent commerce tools are untested hypotheses. This measurement ownership commands premium DS compensation."
2. **Commerce Data Richness:** "I work with one of the richest commerce datasets in the world — billions of transactions across 56M+ sellers. The depth and breadth of Square's commerce data enables analyses that no other dataset can support."
3. **Stripe/Shopify DS Competition:** "Stripe and Shopify offer $320K+ TC for Data Scientists who can validate AI commerce features. Square must match competitive compensation to retain data scientists who measure and optimize intelligent seller tools."
4. **AI Feature Optimization:** "I optimize AI-driven pricing, demand forecasting, and automated marketing through rigorous experimentation. Data Scientists who can measure the business impact of ML features at scale across millions of sellers command premium comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base and $272K RSUs over 4 years with 18% performance bonus for this Data Scientist role. I validate and measure AI-powered commerce tools across 56M+ sellers — designing experiments that determine which AI features deliver real business value at scale. I have competing offers from [Stripe at $320K TC / Shopify at $312K TC / Toast at $298K TC]. Data Scientists who validate AI commerce features across millions of sellers are essential to the AI transformation." Accept at $192K+ base and $228K+ RSUs.
