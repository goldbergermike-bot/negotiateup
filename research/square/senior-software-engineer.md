### 🏗️ Square AI-Powered Commerce Tools Lever
As a Senior Software Engineer, you lead the technical architecture for embedding AI across Square's commerce stack. You design the systems that deliver intelligent pricing recommendations, demand forecasting, and automated campaign management to sellers — ensuring these AI features are reliable, scalable, and accessible at the latency requirements of real-time commerce.

Your architectural decisions determine how AI models are served, how seller data flows through the ML pipeline, and how intelligent features are surfaced in Square's products. This is senior-level ownership of the AI commerce transformation.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Commerce Architecture Ownership:** "I lead the technical architecture for AI-powered commerce features serving 56M+ sellers. My design decisions determine how ML models are integrated into real-time commerce workflows — this architectural ownership commands senior-level premium compensation."
2. **Block Cross-Platform Leverage:** "My systems serve the entire Block ecosystem. Architectural decisions I make for Square's AI commerce features have direct impact on Cash App merchant integrations and TBD commerce protocols — this cross-platform leverage justifies premium equity."
3. **Stripe/Shopify Sr SWE Competition:** "Stripe and Shopify offer $385K+ TC for Senior SWEs building AI commerce infrastructure. Square must match competitive compensation to retain senior engineers who own the architecture of AI-powered seller tools."
4. **Real-Time AI Commerce Scale:** "I design systems that serve AI-driven insights to millions of sellers in real time — intelligent pricing, demand prediction, and automated operations at sub-100ms latency. The technical complexity of real-time AI at commerce scale demands premium comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base and $352K RSUs over 4 years with 18% performance bonus for this Senior Software Engineer role. I lead the technical architecture for AI-powered commerce features serving 56M+ sellers — designing systems that integrate ML models into real-time commerce workflows at scale. I have competing offers from [Stripe at $385K TC / Shopify at $372K TC / Toast at $358K TC]. Senior engineers who own AI commerce architecture are defining how intelligent seller tools work at scale." Accept at $218K+ base and $298K+ RSUs.
