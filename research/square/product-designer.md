**Negotiation DNA**

Square Product Designers craft the user experiences that 56M+ sellers interact with daily — designing intuitive interfaces for payments, inventory management, analytics dashboards, and commerce tools that make complex business operations simple. At the D3-D4 level within Block's $45B+ ecosystem, you own the design systems, interaction patterns, and visual language that define Square's brand. With Square's 2026 AI-powered commerce initiative, Product Designers now design how AI insights are surfaced to sellers — creating interfaces that make machine learning predictions, automated recommendations, and intelligent analytics accessible to non-technical business owners. Block RSUs with NYSE liquidity reward designers who create experiences that drive seller engagement and retention. [Source: Square Design Comp 2025-2026]

You solve the critical UX challenge of making sophisticated machine learning predictions — demand forecasting, pricing optimization, customer segmentation — understandable and actionable for small business owners who have no data science background.

Your design decisions determine whether AI-powered commerce tools are adopted or ignored. The difference between AI that empowers sellers and AI that confuses them is entirely a design problem.
