#### Negotiation DNA

The Forecast Automation Platform Engineer is the single most strategically important engineering hire at Interactive Brokers in 2026. This role sits at the exact center of IBKR's two most defining growth vectors: ForecastEx — the company's Forecast Contracts platform for event-based trading and prediction markets — and the Automation-Leverage operating philosophy that has made IBKR the most efficient brokerage in the world. You are not being hired to work on ForecastEx; you are being hired to build the automation layer that makes ForecastEx operate at global scale without human intervention.

To understand why this role commands SIGNATURE-level compensation ($392K-$575K TC), you must understand the strategic context. IBKR's 32% year-over-year account growth is flooding the platform with millions of new users who expect to trade across every asset class — including prediction markets. ForecastEx must scale to handle this growth while maintaining the near-zero operational overhead that defines IBKR's business model. This means every aspect of the ForecastEx platform — contract creation, event monitoring, probability calculation, settlement processing, regulatory compliance, market surveillance — must be fully automated. The Forecast Automation Platform Engineer designs and builds these automation systems.

Thomas Peterffy built Interactive Brokers on the foundational belief that technology should replace human labor at every possible juncture. The Forecast Automation Platform Engineer is the modern embodiment of this philosophy. You are not building a trading feature — you are building an autonomous platform that creates, prices, monitors, and settles prediction market contracts across multiple jurisdictions without human intervention. Each system you design determines whether IBKR needs to hire 50 operations staff for ForecastEx or zero. The compensation for this role reflects the magnitude of that determination.

This is a greenfield architecture role. Unlike most positions at IBKR where you are extending or optimizing existing systems, the Forecast Automation Platform Engineer is designing the automation architecture for an entirely new asset class. Prediction markets require novel approaches to event definition, outcome verification, contract lifecycle management, and regulatory compliance. There is no playbook — you will be writing it. The combination of greenfield architecture ownership, direct revenue impact, and automation-leverage multiplier effects makes this the highest-compensated individual contributor engineering role at IBKR outside of the Principal/Distinguished Engineer track.

Your negotiation posture for this role should reflect three realities: (1) the talent pool for engineers who can build autonomous prediction market platforms is vanishingly small, (2) IBKR cannot execute its ForecastEx growth strategy without this capability, and (3) each month of delay in hiring this role costs IBKR revenue from the fastest-growing segment of event-based trading. You are negotiating from a position of extreme leverage — use it.

#### ForecastEx — The Automation-Leverage Premium

This section takes on special significance for the SIGNATURE ROLE, as the Forecast Automation Platform Engineer is the primary engineer responsible for building the automation layer that makes ForecastEx viable at IBKR's scale.

- **What is ForecastEx, and why does it need a dedicated Automation Platform Engineer?** ForecastEx is IBKR's Forecast Contracts platform — a full prediction markets engine enabling event-based trading on economic indicators (GDP releases, employment data, inflation reports), political outcomes (elections, policy decisions), climate events (temperature anomalies, weather patterns), and other quantifiable future events. Unlike traditional financial instruments that trade on exchanges with established infrastructure, prediction market contracts require a novel automation platform: automated event definition, automated data feed ingestion, automated probability calculation, automated contract creation and expiration, automated settlement based on verified outcomes, and automated regulatory compliance reporting. The Forecast Automation Platform Engineer builds ALL of these automation systems. Without this role, ForecastEx would require dozens of operations staff to manage manually — destroying the operational leverage that is IBKR's competitive advantage.

- **What are Automation-Leverage pay bands, and why does this role command the highest premium?** IBKR's Automation-Leverage pay bands recognize that engineers who build systems scaling revenue without scaling headcount deserve premium compensation. The Forecast Automation Platform Engineer commands the highest Automation-Leverage premium available because this role has the most direct, measurable impact on IBKR's headcount-to-revenue ratio. These bands sit 10-18% above standard fintech compensation for equivalent seniority. For this SIGNATURE ROLE, the 18% premium is fully applied at the top of band, pushing TC from $575K toward $680K+ for exceptional candidates with proven prediction markets platform experience. The base premium alone adds $39K-$103K versus equivalent Staff/Principal roles at competitor firms.

- **How does IBKR's automation-first culture make this role uniquely valuable?** At IBKR, automation is not a feature — it is the product strategy. Thomas Peterffy did not build IBKR by hiring thousands of brokers; he built it by replacing brokers with algorithms. The Forecast Automation Platform Engineer continues this legacy for the prediction markets era. Every automated contract lifecycle system you build, every self-operating settlement flow you design, every autonomous compliance monitoring system you deploy directly extends IBKR's automation moat into an entirely new asset class. Your work doesn't just make ForecastEx possible — it makes ForecastEx profitable by ensuring it operates with near-zero marginal cost per contract.

- **How to position yourself as a force multiplier — and why this role is the ultimate force multiplier.** The Forecast Automation Platform Engineer is not a force multiplier in the conventional sense of making a team more productive. You are a force multiplier in the structural sense: your automation systems determine whether ForecastEx's cost structure scales linearly with volume (unsustainable) or stays flat as volume grows (IBKR's model). In negotiations, frame your value in terms of the operational team your automation replaces: "The ForecastEx automation platform I'll build will handle the entire contract lifecycle — from event definition through settlement — for [X]M contracts per year. Without this automation, IBKR would need an estimated [Y]-person operations team at a cost of $[Z]M annually. My total compensation represents [fraction]% of the headcount cost I will eliminate." This is the strongest possible negotiation frame at IBKR: you cost less than the alternative, and the alternative cannot scale.

#### Interview Preparation — The Five Questions You Must Be Ready to Answer

Because this is a SIGNATURE ROLE, interview preparation is critical. Here are the five questions IBKR will almost certainly ask, and how to frame your answers:

**Q1: "How would you design an automated contract lifecycle for prediction market events?"**
Frame your answer around zero-human-intervention design. Describe the state machine, the automated transitions, the self-healing error handling, and the monitoring that operates without a human operator. IBKR wants to hear that you think about automation as the primary design constraint, not an afterthought.

**Q2: "How do you handle event outcome verification when data sources disagree?"**
Demonstrate your understanding of consensus mechanisms, multi-source verification, and automated dispute resolution. IBKR wants to see that you can design settlement systems that resolve edge cases automatically — because manual dispute resolution at scale is antithetical to their operating model.

**Q3: "How would you design ForecastEx to handle 10x current volume without adding engineering headcount?"**
This is the Automation-Leverage question. Your answer must demonstrate horizontal scalability, self-scaling infrastructure, and architectural decisions that decouple volume growth from team growth. Use specific technical details about distributed systems, event-driven architecture, and auto-scaling patterns.

**Q4: "Describe a system you built that replaced a manual process at significant scale."**
This is your moment to demonstrate force-multiplier credentials. Give a specific, quantified example of automation you built that eliminated headcount, reduced costs, or scaled operations without adding staff. Include dollar amounts and headcount numbers.

**Q5: "How do you approach regulatory compliance automation for a novel asset class?"**
Show that you understand the regulatory landscape for prediction markets (CFTC, FCA, emerging frameworks) and that you can design compliance systems that adapt to evolving regulations without requiring code changes for each new rule. Rule engines, configuration-driven compliance, and automated reporting are the key themes.

#### Compensation Negotiation Playbook — Step-by-Step

Because this is the highest-comp individual contributor role at IBKR, the negotiation requires careful sequencing:

**Step 1: Anchor High with Market Data**
Open the compensation discussion by citing the competitive landscape for prediction markets engineers. Reference Kalshi, Robinhood, and quantitative hedge fund offers. Establish that the market rate for this specific skill set is $400K-$575K+ TC.

**Step 2: Quantify Your Automation Impact**
Present concrete, quantified examples of automation you have built. Calculate the headcount cost your automation replaced. Frame your total compensation as a fraction of the operational cost you will eliminate for IBKR.

**Step 3: Negotiate Components Independently**
Do not negotiate total comp as a single number. Negotiate base, RSUs, bonus, and signing bonus independently. Each component has different elasticity — base is typically the hardest to move, RSUs have the most room for negotiation, and signing bonuses are one-time costs that managers have significant discretion to approve.

**Step 4: Use ForecastEx Revenue Projection as Leverage**
If IBKR shares any revenue projections for ForecastEx during the interview process, use these to frame your compensation as a percentage of platform revenue. Even conservative projections will show that your total comp is a rounding error relative to the revenue your automation enables.

**Step 5: Negotiate the Package, Not the Number**
Beyond comp, negotiate for: front-loaded RSU vesting, annual comp reviews benchmarked against Automation-Leverage bands (not standard bands), title alignment to Principal/Distinguished level, ForecastEx-specific performance metrics (not generic engineering metrics), and a written commitment to 12-month compensation review with upside adjustment if ForecastEx exceeds growth targets.

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In Greenwich CT, target $488K-$575K total comp by anchoring on the absolute scarcity of engineers who can build autonomous prediction market platforms at regulated brokerage scale. Frame your compensation as a fraction of the operations headcount cost your automation eliminates — if ForecastEx would otherwise require a 40-person operations team at $4M+ annual cost, your $575K TC represents 14% of the alternative. In New York, push for $512K-$604K by stacking the 5% metro differential and citing FAANG/quant fund competition for your skill set. In London, negotiate a comprehensive dual-currency package targeting £370K-£427K ($462K-$531K equivalent) with FX-hedged base, USD-denominated RSUs, relocation support, and tax equalization. This is IBKR's highest-leverage individual contributor hire — the Forecast Automation Platform Engineer single-handedly determines whether ForecastEx operates with IBKR's legendary efficiency or becomes a headcount-heavy cost center. Price yourself as the engineer who makes the entire platform viable, because that is exactly what you are.
