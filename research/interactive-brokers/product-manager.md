#### Negotiation DNA

Product management at Interactive Brokers is unlike PM work at virtually any other technology company. IBKR's product philosophy is dictated by a singular vision: every product must automate a process, reduce a cost, or scale a revenue stream without adding headcount. There are no vanity features, no growth-hack experiments, no "engagement metrics" divorced from revenue. As a PM at IBKR, every product decision you make must directly contribute to the company's automation-leverage model. Your negotiation must demonstrate that you understand this — and that you have a track record of shipping products that drive measurable business outcomes.

The 32% year-over-year account growth has created urgent demand for PMs who can define and ship products that absorb this growth without requiring proportional operational scaling. ForecastEx — IBKR's Forecast Contracts platform for event-based trading — is the flagship example: an entirely new product vertical launched to capture prediction markets revenue. PMs working on ForecastEx or adjacent trading products are negotiating from a position of considerable strength, as these roles sit at the intersection of product innovation and IBKR's core automation thesis.

Thomas Peterffy's approach to product development is engineering-led and data-driven. PMs at IBKR are expected to be deeply technical — you must understand trading systems, market microstructure, and regulatory constraints. If you bring domain expertise in electronic trading, derivatives, or financial product design, your negotiation leverage increases significantly. IBKR does not hire PMs who need to be taught the business; they hire PMs who can immediately contribute to product strategy for one of the world's most sophisticated trading platforms.

#### ForecastEx — The Automation-Leverage Premium

- **What is ForecastEx?** ForecastEx is IBKR's Forecast Contracts platform enabling event-based trading across economic, political, and climate outcomes. For Product Managers, ForecastEx represents the highest-impact product opportunity at IBKR — defining how prediction markets are designed, regulated, and monetized at scale. PMs who own ForecastEx product strategy or adjacent trading product lines command Automation-Leverage compensation premiums that reflect the direct revenue impact of their product decisions.

- **What are Automation-Leverage pay bands?** IBKR recognizes that PMs who design products requiring minimal operational overhead — products that scale revenue without scaling headcount — warrant premium compensation. These Automation-Leverage bands sit 10-18% above standard fintech PM compensation. For a Product Manager, this translates to an additional $21K-$53K in total comp, pushing top-band TC from $295K toward $345K+ when the automation premium is fully applied.

- **How does IBKR's automation-first culture affect PM value?** At IBKR, PMs don't just define features — they define products that must operate at massive scale with minimal human intervention. Every product requirement you write must account for automation. This constraint is your leverage: PMs who can design self-operating products are extraordinarily rare and valuable. When you join IBKR, your product decisions directly determine whether the company needs to hire 20 operations staff or zero.

- **How to position yourself as a force multiplier:** In your negotiation, frame your product track record through an automation lens. Use language like: "I shipped [product] that processes [X] transactions per day with zero manual intervention, generating $[Y]M in annual revenue with an operational team of [Z]." Show that you think about products as automated revenue systems, not feature sets. This framing directly aligns with IBKR's product philosophy and justifies Automation-Leverage premium compensation.

I'd like to discuss a GBP base with a 10% regulatory complexity adjustment and USD-denominated RSUs aligned with the NASDAQ listing."*
   Dollar impact: +8-12% on base salary for regulatory specialization.
