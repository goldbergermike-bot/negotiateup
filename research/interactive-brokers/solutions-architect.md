#### Negotiation DNA

The Solutions Architect role at Interactive Brokers sits at the intersection of technical architecture, client engagement, and platform scalability. IBKR serves an extraordinarily diverse client base — from individual retail traders to hedge funds, RIAs, proprietary trading firms, and institutional investors — all through a unified multi-asset platform. As a Solutions Architect, you design the technical solutions that enable these clients to integrate with IBKR's trading infrastructure, often through APIs, FIX connections, and custom integration patterns that must handle millions of transactions with zero manual intervention.

With 32% year-over-year account growth, the demand for scalable, self-service integration solutions has never been higher. IBKR cannot assign a dedicated engineer to every institutional client integration. Solutions Architects must design integration patterns that are so well-documented, so well-architected, and so self-guiding that clients can integrate and operate independently. This is the automation-leverage challenge for Solutions Architects: every integration you design must work at scale without ongoing human support.

ForecastEx introduces a new dimension to the Solutions Architect role. Prediction market contracts are a novel asset class that institutional clients will want to access through programmatic APIs. Designing the integration architecture for ForecastEx — enabling algorithmic trading firms to build on top of IBKR's prediction markets infrastructure — is one of the most high-impact architecture challenges available at the company.

#### ForecastEx — The Automation-Leverage Premium

- **What is ForecastEx?** ForecastEx is IBKR's Forecast Contracts platform for event-based trading. For Solutions Architects, ForecastEx creates a new integration surface: institutional clients and algorithmic trading firms need programmatic access to prediction market contracts through APIs, FIX protocols, and custom data feeds. Architects who design the ForecastEx integration layer — enabling clients to build automated trading systems on IBKR's prediction markets infrastructure — command the highest Automation-Leverage premiums in the solutions architecture function.

- **What are Automation-Leverage pay bands?** IBKR recognizes that Solutions Architects who design self-service integration patterns — solutions that scale to thousands of clients without dedicated support staff — warrant premium compensation. These Automation-Leverage bands sit 10-18% above standard fintech solutions architect compensation. For a Solutions Architect, this translates to an additional $21K-$54K in total comp, pushing top-band TC from $302K toward $350K+ when the automation premium is applied.

- **How does IBKR's automation-first culture amplify Solutions Architect value?** IBKR's API and integration infrastructure serves thousands of institutional clients simultaneously. Each integration pattern you design must be robust enough to operate without a dedicated support engineer. When you architect a self-service integration solution, you are directly scaling IBKR's institutional client capacity without scaling its support organization. This is the definition of automation-leverage, and it is the foundation of your compensation negotiation.

- **How to position yourself as a force multiplier:** In negotiations, quantify the scale of integrations you have designed and the support costs they have avoided. Use language like: "At [Previous Company], I designed an API integration framework adopted by [X] enterprise clients, with a self-service success rate of [Y]%, eliminating the need for [Z] dedicated integration support engineers." At IBKR, the best Solutions Architects are those whose architectures are so clean that clients never need to call support.

#### Global Levers

1. **Multi-Asset Platform Expertise Premium** — Solutions Architects with cross-asset class experience (equities, options, futures, forex, bonds, prediction markets) command higher base salaries.
   > *"My experience designing integration solutions across [multiple asset classes] means I can architect IBKR client solutions spanning the full product suite — including ForecastEx — from day one. Given the complexity of IBKR's multi-asset platform, I'd like to discuss a base salary in the $188K-$205K range that reflects this cross-asset architecture capability."*
   Dollar impact: +$12K-$22K on base salary.

2. **Institutional Client Revenue Impact** — Push for compensation reflecting the revenue each integration unlocks.
   > *"Each institutional integration I architect at IBKR directly unlocks trading revenue. A hedge fund integration generating $[X]M in annual commission revenue justifies a total comp package that reflects this direct revenue attribution. I'd like to discuss total comp in the $270K-$302K range with a bonus component tied to institutional integration velocity and revenue impact."*
   Dollar impact: +$15K-$25K total comp.

3. **RSU Grant for Platform Integration Scale** — Your architectural decisions scale across thousands of clients.
   > *"Integration architectures I design will be used by thousands of IBKR institutional clients. I'd like to discuss an RSU grant in the $52K-$60K/year range that reflects the compound revenue impact of self-service integration patterns that scale client capacity without scaling support headcount."*
   Dollar impact: +$10K-$18K annualized RSU value.

4. **London Cross-Border Architecture Premium** — For London roles, negotiate a premium for multi-regulatory integration architecture.
   > *"The London Solutions Architect role requires designing integration patterns that comply with FCA, MiFID II, EMIR, and cross-border data residency regulations — significantly more complex than single-jurisdiction architecture. I'd like to discuss a GBP base with a regulatory complexity premium and USD-denominated RSUs, targeting total comp in the £192K-£223K ($240K-$279K equivalent) range."*
   Dollar impact: +8-12% effective comp for cross-border regulatory expertise.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In Greenwich CT, target $260K-$302K total comp by leading with multi-asset platform expertise and quantifying the institutional revenue your integration architectures unlock. In New York, push for $273K-$317K with the metro differential. In London, negotiate a dual-currency package targeting £192K-£223K ($240K-$279K equivalent) with cross-border regulatory architecture complexity as leverage. Solutions Architects at IBKR must demonstrate that their integration designs are self-service and self-scaling — show that your architectures eliminate the need for dedicated client support, and you will command Automation-Leverage premium compensation.
