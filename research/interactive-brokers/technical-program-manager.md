#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Management at Interactive Brokers is a role defined by execution velocity and organizational leverage. IBKR's engineering culture is famously engineering-led — programs are not managed through heavy process overhead but through lightweight coordination that maximizes engineer productivity. As a TPM, your value is measured not by the number of meetings you schedule or status reports you produce, but by how effectively you remove blockers, coordinate cross-team dependencies, and accelerate delivery velocity for lean engineering teams.

The 32% year-over-year account growth has created a portfolio of concurrent, high-stakes programs: ForecastEx platform launch, multi-market trading infrastructure scaling, regulatory compliance programs across 34 jurisdictions, and client-facing platform modernization. These programs must be delivered by small, senior engineering teams — and the TPM is the connective tissue that ensures these teams move in concert without the bureaucratic overhead that slows down larger organizations.

At IBKR, the best TPMs are those who automate program management itself. Instead of manually tracking dependencies and chasing status updates, they build systems, dashboards, and automated workflows that make cross-team coordination self-operating. This is the automation-leverage thesis applied to program management: the TPM who eliminates the need for status meetings by building real-time visibility systems is worth more than the TPM who runs those meetings manually.

#### ForecastEx — The Automation-Leverage Premium

- **What is ForecastEx?** ForecastEx is IBKR's Forecast Contracts platform for event-based trading. For TPMs, ForecastEx represents a flagship cross-functional program: coordinating engineering, compliance, product, and operations teams to launch a novel trading platform across multiple regulatory jurisdictions simultaneously. TPMs leading ForecastEx-adjacent programs — or programs with similar cross-functional complexity — command Automation-Leverage premiums for delivering at IBKR's characteristically lean pace.

- **What are Automation-Leverage pay bands?** IBKR recognizes that TPMs who enable lean teams to deliver at the velocity of much larger organizations — without adding process overhead or coordination headcount — warrant premium compensation. These Automation-Leverage bands sit 10-18% above standard fintech TPM compensation. For a TPM, this translates to an additional $19K-$50K in total comp, pushing top-band TC from $275K toward $320K+ when the automation premium is applied.

- **How does IBKR's automation-first culture redefine the TPM role?** At most companies, TPMs are process managers. At IBKR, TPMs are expected to be process automators. The best IBKR TPMs build self-updating dashboards, automated dependency tracking systems, and cross-team coordination tools that operate without manual intervention. Your value is measured by how much coordination you enable without adding meetings, reports, or process overhead.

- **How to position yourself as a force multiplier:** In negotiations, frame your track record around delivery velocity per headcount. Use language like: "At [Previous Company], I managed a program involving [X] engineering teams totaling [Y] engineers, delivering [Z] on a timeline that peer companies staffed with [2-3X] engineers. I achieved this by automating [specific coordination processes] and eliminating [number] hours of weekly meeting overhead through real-time visibility tooling." This framing demonstrates you are an automation-leverage TPM, not a process-overhead TPM.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lean Execution Premium** — TPMs who deliver complex programs with minimal process overhead command higher base salaries.
   > *"My approach to program management aligns with IBKR's engineering-led culture. I specialize in lightweight coordination that maximizes engineer productivity — not bureaucratic process management. At [Previous Company], I reduced program management overhead by [X]% while accelerating delivery by [Y]%. I'd like to discuss a base salary in the $172K-$187K range that reflects this lean execution capability."*
   Dollar impact: +$10K-$18K on base salary.

2. **Multi-Jurisdictional Program Complexity** — Programs spanning multiple regulatory jurisdictions command a premium.
   > *"IBKR operates across 34 jurisdictions with distinct regulatory requirements. Programs I manage will require coordinating engineering, compliance, and legal teams across multiple regulatory frameworks simultaneously. I'd like to discuss a total comp package in the $248K-$275K range that reflects this multi-jurisdictional program complexity."*
   Dollar impact: +$15K-$25K total comp.

3. **RSU Grant for Platform-Wide Program Impact** — Your programs affect the entire trading platform.
   > *"Programs I lead at IBKR will directly impact platform reliability, feature velocity, and regulatory compliance across 2.8M+ client accounts. I'd like to discuss an RSU grant in the $46K-$54K/year range that reflects the platform-wide impact of successful program delivery."*
   Dollar impact: +$8K-$15K annualized RSU value.

4. **London Cross-Border Program Premium** — For London TPM roles coordinating European and global programs.
   > *"The London TPM role involves coordinating programs across US, European, and Asian engineering and compliance teams with distinct regulatory timelines. I'd like to discuss a GBP base with cross-border program complexity adjustment and USD-denominated RSUs, targeting total comp in the £172K-£203K ($215K-$254K equivalent) range."*
   Dollar impact: +6-10% effective comp for cross-border program scope.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In Greenwich CT, target $235K-$275K total comp by demonstrating lean execution capability and framing yourself as a TPM who automates coordination rather than adding process overhead. In New York, push for $247K-$289K with the metro differential. In London, negotiate a dual-currency package targeting £172K-£203K ($215K-$254K equivalent) with cross-border program complexity as leverage. TPMs at IBKR must prove they accelerate engineering teams without slowing them down — show that you eliminate coordination overhead through automation and real-time tooling, not through more meetings and status reports.
