#### Negotiation DNA

Data science at Interactive Brokers operates at the intersection of quantitative finance and platform automation. IBKR processes millions of trades daily across 150+ markets, generating massive datasets on order flow, risk exposure, client behavior, and market microstructure. As a Data Scientist, you are not building dashboards for stakeholder presentations — you are building models that directly inform automated trading systems, risk management engines, and pricing algorithms that operate at global scale with minimal human oversight.

The 32% year-over-year account growth has exponentially increased the value of IBKR's data assets and the urgency of automated decision-making. Every new account generates data that feeds models, and every model improvement compounds across 2.8M+ accounts. ForecastEx — IBKR's Forecast Contracts platform — has created an entirely new data science frontier: modeling event probabilities, pricing prediction contracts, and building the quantitative foundations of a new asset class.

Your negotiation leverage as a Data Scientist at IBKR comes from the direct revenue impact of your models. Unlike data science roles at consumer tech companies where you might optimize click-through rates, at IBKR your models directly influence trade execution, risk pricing, and platform revenue. This is quantitative work with immediate P&L impact, and your compensation should reflect the magnitude of decisions your models inform.

#### ForecastEx — The Automation-Leverage Premium

- **What is ForecastEx?** ForecastEx is IBKR's Forecast Contracts platform for event-based trading on economic, political, and climate outcomes. For Data Scientists, ForecastEx presents a uniquely compelling challenge: building the probabilistic models that price event contracts, detect market manipulation, and optimize contract design for a novel trading paradigm. Data Scientists working on ForecastEx quantitative infrastructure are eligible for the highest Automation-Leverage premiums in the data science function.

- **What are Automation-Leverage pay bands?** IBKR recognizes that Data Scientists who build models that automate decision-making at scale — replacing manual analysis, human risk review, and ad-hoc reporting with self-operating analytical systems — warrant premium compensation. These Automation-Leverage bands sit 10-18% above standard fintech data science compensation. For a Data Scientist, this translates to an additional $20K-$52K in total comp, pushing top-band TC from $288K toward $335K+ when the automation premium is applied.

- **How does IBKR's automation-first culture amplify data science value?** At IBKR, models don't inform human decisions — they make decisions autonomously. Risk models automatically adjust margin requirements. Pricing models automatically set spreads. Fraud detection models automatically flag accounts. This level of model-driven automation means your work has direct, unmediated impact on IBKR's operations and revenue. You are not advising decision-makers; you are building the decision-making systems themselves.

- **How to position yourself as a force multiplier:** In negotiations, emphasize models you have built that operate autonomously in production. Use language like: "At [Previous Company], I built a [risk/pricing/detection] model that processes [X] decisions per day with zero human review, replacing a team of [Y] analysts and improving accuracy by [Z]%." At IBKR, the highest-paid Data Scientists are those whose models eliminate the need for human analytical teams. Quantify the headcount your models have replaced and the revenue they have generated or protected.

#### Global Levers

1. **Quantitative Finance Expertise Premium** — Data Scientists with trading/quantitative finance backgrounds command top-of-band compensation.
   > *"My background in [quantitative finance/derivatives pricing/risk modeling] means I can contribute to IBKR's most revenue-critical models from day one. Given the direct P&L impact of quantitative modeling at IBKR, I'd like to discuss a base salary in the $180K-$195K range that reflects both the domain expertise and the autonomous decision-making nature of these models."*
   Dollar impact: +$12K-$22K on base salary.

2. **Model Revenue Attribution Bonus** — Push for a bonus structure tied to the revenue or cost impact of your models.
   > *"I'd like to discuss a bonus structure where a portion is tied to the measurable impact of my models — revenue generated by pricing optimizations, losses prevented by risk models, or operational costs reduced by automation. A target bonus of $30K-$35K with upside for exceptional model impact would align my compensation with the direct P&L influence of my work."*
   Dollar impact: +$8K-$15K on bonus.

3. **RSU Grant for Platform-Scale Model Impact** — Your models affect every account. Negotiate RSUs reflecting this.
   > *"Models I build at IBKR will process data from 2.8M+ accounts and directly influence automated trading, risk, and pricing decisions at global scale. I'd like to discuss an RSU grant in the $50K-$58K/year range that reflects the compound impact of my quantitative work across the entire platform."*
   Dollar impact: +$10K-$18K annualized RSU value.

4. **London Quant Market Competition** — London's quantitative talent market is intensely competitive. Use competing offers from hedge funds and prop trading firms.
   > *"London's quantitative talent market is highly competitive, with firms like Man Group, Citadel Europe, and GSA Capital offering aggressive packages. I'd like to discuss a dual-currency structure with a GBP base at £130K-£144K, USD-denominated RSUs, and a performance bonus that reflects the direct revenue impact of my quantitative work at IBKR."*
   Dollar impact: +8-15% effective comp in London quant market.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In Greenwich CT, target $248K-$288K total comp by leading with quantitative finance expertise and demonstrating that your models operate autonomously at production scale. In New York, push for $260K-$302K with the metro differential. In London, negotiate a dual-currency quant package targeting £185K-£213K ($231K-$266K equivalent) with competition from London's hedge fund and prop trading sector as leverage. Data Scientists at IBKR must demonstrate that their models replace human analysts and automate decisions — show that you build self-operating quantitative systems, not analytical reports, and you will command Automation-Leverage premium compensation.
