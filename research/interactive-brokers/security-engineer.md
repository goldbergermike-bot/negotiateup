#### Negotiation DNA

Security engineering at Interactive Brokers is not a compliance checkbox function — it is a core business-critical capability that directly protects billions of dollars in client assets and trading infrastructure. IBKR holds custody of client assets across 2.8M+ accounts, processes millions of trades daily, and operates in 34 regulatory jurisdictions. A security breach at IBKR would not just be a data incident — it would be a financial disaster affecting millions of investors. As a Security Engineer, you are the last line of defense for one of the world's most critical financial systems.

The 32% year-over-year account growth has exponentially expanded IBKR's attack surface. Every new account, every new integration, every new market connection is a potential vulnerability. ForecastEx — IBKR's prediction markets platform — introduces entirely new security considerations: event-based contracts create novel manipulation vectors, prediction market data creates new privacy considerations, and the regulatory framework for this asset class is still evolving. Security engineers who can protect ForecastEx infrastructure while enabling rapid product iteration are extraordinarily valuable.

IBKR's security team, like all IBKR teams, operates with a lean staffing model. This means each security engineer must be a generalist across application security, infrastructure security, threat detection, and compliance — while building automated security systems that scale protection without scaling headcount. Your negotiation must reflect this breadth of responsibility and the direct financial risk your work mitigates.

#### ForecastEx — The Automation-Leverage Premium

- **What is ForecastEx?** ForecastEx is IBKR's Forecast Contracts platform for event-based trading. For Security Engineers, ForecastEx introduces novel security challenges: protecting prediction market infrastructure from manipulation, securing event-outcome data feeds, preventing insider-information exploitation in contract pricing, and ensuring regulatory compliance for a new asset class across multiple jurisdictions. Security engineers who can threat-model and secure ForecastEx systems command the highest Automation-Leverage premiums.

- **What are Automation-Leverage pay bands?** IBKR recognizes that Security Engineers who build automated security systems — threat detection that operates without human monitoring, compliance checks that run without manual audit, vulnerability scanning that executes without analyst intervention — warrant premium compensation. These Automation-Leverage bands sit 10-18% above standard fintech security compensation. For a Security Engineer, this translates to an additional $21K-$55K in total comp, pushing top-band TC from $305K toward $355K+ when the automation premium is applied.

- **How does IBKR's automation-first culture amplify security engineer value?** IBKR's security team cannot rely on large SOC teams or armies of compliance analysts. Security at IBKR must be automated: automated threat detection, automated vulnerability remediation, automated compliance monitoring, automated incident response workflows. Each security system you build that operates without human intervention directly enables IBKR to maintain its lean operating model while protecting an ever-growing attack surface.

- **How to position yourself as a force multiplier:** In negotiations, quantify the automated security systems you have built. Use language like: "At [Previous Company], I built an automated threat detection system that processes [X] security events per day with a [Y]% automated resolution rate, replacing a [Z]-person SOC team. I designed automated compliance monitoring that covers [N] regulatory frameworks without manual audit cycles." At IBKR, the most valuable security engineers are those who have automated security operations to the point where they rarely need human intervention.

2. **Automated Security Operations Bonus** — Push for a bonus tied to security automation coverage metrics.
   > *"I'd like to discuss a bonus structure where a portion is tied to security automation outcomes — automated threat detection coverage, mean-time-to-automated-response improvements, and compliance automation expansion. A target bonus of $32K-$37K with upside for measurable security automation milestones would align my incentives with IBKR's automation-first security model."*
   Dollar impact: +$8K-$14K on bonus.

I'd like to discuss a GBP base with regulatory security adjustment and USD-denominated RSUs, targeting total comp in the £195K-£225K ($244K-$281K equivalent) range."*
