#### Negotiation DNA

Data engineering at Interactive Brokers is the backbone of one of the world's most data-intensive financial platforms. IBKR processes millions of trades daily across 150+ markets, generating enormous volumes of real-time market data, order flow data, risk data, and client activity data. As a Data Engineer, you are not building ETL pipelines for analytics dashboards — you are building the real-time data infrastructure that feeds automated trading systems, risk engines, and compliance monitoring systems that must operate with zero downtime and microsecond-level latency requirements.

The 32% year-over-year account growth has created a data scaling challenge of extraordinary proportions. Data volumes are growing exponentially — more accounts, more trades, more market data, more compliance data — and the data infrastructure must scale without proportional headcount growth. This is the quintessential automation-leverage challenge for data engineers: build data pipelines and infrastructure that handle 2-5x current volume without requiring additional data engineering staff to maintain them.

ForecastEx introduces a new data domain: event-outcome data, prediction market pricing data, and forecast contract settlement data. This is a net-new data infrastructure requirement that must be integrated with IBKR's existing multi-asset data platform. Data engineers who can extend IBKR's data architecture to accommodate entirely new asset classes — while maintaining the platform's legendary reliability — are in exceptional demand.

#### ForecastEx — The Automation-Leverage Premium

- **What is ForecastEx?** ForecastEx is IBKR's Forecast Contracts platform for event-based trading. For Data Engineers, ForecastEx creates a new data infrastructure domain: ingesting event-outcome data feeds (economic indicators, election results, climate data), building real-time pricing pipelines for prediction contracts, and designing settlement data flows for a novel asset class. Data Engineers who build ForecastEx data infrastructure — integrating it seamlessly with IBKR's existing multi-asset data platform — command Automation-Leverage premiums.

- **What are Automation-Leverage pay bands?** IBKR recognizes that Data Engineers who build self-operating data infrastructure — pipelines that scale, self-heal, and maintain data quality without manual intervention — warrant premium compensation. These Automation-Leverage bands sit 10-18% above standard fintech data engineering compensation. For a Data Engineer, this translates to an additional $19K-$50K in total comp, pushing top-band TC from $278K toward $325K+ when the automation premium is applied.

- **How does IBKR's automation-first culture amplify data engineer value?** At IBKR, data pipelines are not batch jobs that analysts monitor — they are real-time systems that feed automated trading and risk decisions for millions of accounts. When your pipeline fails, trades fail. When your pipeline is slow, risk calculations are stale. The data infrastructure you build is directly in the critical path of IBKR's revenue generation. This criticality, combined with IBKR's lean team model, means each data engineer has an outsized impact on platform reliability and revenue capacity.

- **How to position yourself as a force multiplier:** In negotiations, quantify the scale and autonomy of data infrastructure you have built. Use language like: "At [Previous Company], I built a real-time data pipeline processing [X]M events per day with [Y]% uptime and zero manual intervention, replacing [Z] data operations staff. I designed self-healing data infrastructure that has operated for [N] months without manual data quality intervention." At IBKR, the most valued data engineers are those whose pipelines run themselves.

#### Global Levers

1. **Real-Time Financial Data Expertise Premium** — Data engineers with experience in real-time trading data systems command higher base salaries.
   > *"My experience building real-time data infrastructure for [financial/trading] systems — processing [X]M events per second with sub-millisecond latency — makes me immediately productive on IBKR's most critical data infrastructure. I'd like to discuss a base salary in the $172K-$189K range that reflects this specialized real-time financial data engineering expertise."*
   Dollar impact: +$10K-$20K on base salary.

2. **Data Infrastructure Scale Bonus** — Push for a bonus tied to data pipeline automation and reliability metrics.
   > *"I'd like to discuss a bonus structure where a portion is tied to data infrastructure outcomes — pipeline automation coverage, data quality SLA achievement without manual intervention, and infrastructure cost-per-event optimization. A target bonus of $28K-$34K with upside for hitting data infrastructure automation milestones would align my incentives with IBKR's efficiency model."*
   Dollar impact: +$6K-$12K on bonus.

3. **RSU Grant for Platform Data Infrastructure** — Your data pipelines feed every trading system at IBKR.
   > *"Data infrastructure I build at IBKR will feed trading, risk, compliance, and analytics systems across 2.8M+ accounts and 150+ markets. I'd like to discuss an RSU grant in the $47K-$55K/year range that reflects the platform-wide dependency on the data infrastructure I'll own."*
   Dollar impact: +$8K-$16K annualized RSU value.

4. **London Multi-Market Data Premium** — For London data engineering roles supporting European and global market data.
   > *"The London Data Engineer role involves building data infrastructure for IBKR's European market data operations — including exchange-specific data formats, regulatory reporting pipelines, and cross-border data residency compliance. I'd like to discuss a GBP base with multi-market data complexity adjustment and USD-denominated RSUs, targeting total comp in the £175K-£206K ($219K-$257K equivalent) range."*
   Dollar impact: +7-11% effective comp for multi-market data scope.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In Greenwich CT, target $240K-$278K total comp by leading with real-time financial data engineering expertise and quantifying the self-operating data infrastructure you have built. In New York, push for $252K-$292K with the metro differential. In London, negotiate a dual-currency package targeting £175K-£206K ($219K-$257K equivalent) with multi-market data infrastructure complexity as leverage. Data engineers at IBKR must demonstrate that their pipelines are self-operating and self-healing — show that you build data infrastructure that scales without manual intervention, and you will command Automation-Leverage premium compensation.
