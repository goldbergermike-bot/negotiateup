#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps at Interactive Brokers is the purest expression of the company's automation-first philosophy. IBKR processes millions of trades daily across 150+ markets with infrastructure that must maintain near-perfect uptime — because every minute of downtime translates directly to lost trading revenue and regulatory exposure. As a DevOps Engineer, you are not maintaining infrastructure; you are building the automated systems that ensure IBKR's trading platform operates reliably at global scale without requiring a large operations team.

The 32% year-over-year account growth makes DevOps one of the most strategically critical functions at IBKR. Infrastructure must scale to handle exponentially growing trade volumes, new product launches like ForecastEx, and expanding geographic footprint — all without proportional headcount growth. Every deployment pipeline you automate, every monitoring system you build, every self-healing infrastructure component you design directly contributes to IBKR's ability to grow revenue without growing operations staff.

Thomas Peterffy's vision of maximum automation with minimum human intervention is nowhere more literal than in DevOps. IBKR's infrastructure engineering team is famously lean relative to the platform's scale. If you are a DevOps engineer who has built infrastructure that operates autonomously — self-scaling, self-healing, self-deploying — you are speaking IBKR's native language, and your negotiation should reflect the outsized impact of this capability.

#### ForecastEx — The Automation-Leverage Premium

- **What is ForecastEx?** ForecastEx is IBKR's Forecast Contracts platform for event-based trading. For DevOps Engineers, ForecastEx introduces new infrastructure challenges: deploying and operating a real-time prediction markets engine alongside IBKR's existing multi-asset trading platform. The infrastructure must handle event-driven spikes (elections, economic announcements) with zero degradation to core trading performance. DevOps engineers supporting ForecastEx infrastructure command Automation-Leverage premiums for managing this complexity.

- **What are Automation-Leverage pay bands?** IBKR recognizes that DevOps engineers who build self-operating infrastructure — systems that scale, heal, and deploy without human intervention — warrant premium compensation. These Automation-Leverage bands sit 10-18% above standard fintech DevOps compensation. For a DevOps Engineer, this translates to an additional $18K-$46K in total comp, pushing top-band TC from $258K toward $300K+ when the automation premium is fully applied.

- **How does IBKR's automation-first culture amplify DevOps value?** IBKR's infrastructure operates at a scale-to-headcount ratio that would be impossible without extreme automation. Every infrastructure component must be designed to operate without a human operator. As a DevOps Engineer, you are not building infrastructure for today's load — you are building infrastructure that automatically handles 2-5x today's volume as 32% annual account growth compounds. Your automation work directly determines whether IBKR needs to double its infrastructure team or keep it the same size.

- **How to position yourself as a force multiplier:** In negotiations, quantify the infrastructure automation you have built. Use language like: "At [Previous Company], I built a deployment pipeline that handles [X] deployments per day with zero manual intervention, replacing [Y] operations staff. I designed self-scaling infrastructure that handled [Z]x traffic growth without capacity planning intervention." At IBKR, the most valuable DevOps engineers are those who have made themselves — and operations teams — unnecessary through automation.

#### Global Levers

1. **Zero-Downtime Trading Infrastructure Premium** — DevOps engineers maintaining trading system uptime command higher base salaries.
   > *"IBKR's infrastructure must maintain near-perfect uptime for a global trading platform processing millions of trades daily. My experience maintaining [X]% uptime for [trading/financial] systems with automated failover and zero-downtime deployments justifies a base salary in the $160K-$175K range that reflects the revenue protection impact of this work."*
   Dollar impact: +$10K-$20K on base salary.

2. **Infrastructure Scale Bonus** — Push for a bonus tied to infrastructure efficiency metrics.
   > *"I'd like to discuss a bonus structure tied to infrastructure cost-per-trade reduction, deployment automation coverage, and infrastructure-to-account scaling efficiency. A target bonus of $28K-$33K with upside for achieving infrastructure scaling targets would align my incentives with IBKR's growth trajectory."*
   Dollar impact: +$6K-$12K on bonus.

3. **RSU Grant for Platform Reliability Impact** — Infrastructure reliability directly protects IBKR's revenue.
   > *"Infrastructure reliability at IBKR directly protects trading revenue across 2.8M+ accounts. I'd like to discuss an RSU grant in the $42K-$50K/year range that reflects the revenue protection and operational efficiency my infrastructure automation will deliver."*
   Dollar impact: +$8K-$15K annualized RSU value.

4. **London Global Infrastructure Premium** — For London DevOps roles supporting IBKR's European infrastructure.
   > *"The London role involves managing infrastructure for IBKR's European trading operations, including regulatory data residency requirements and cross-datacenter orchestration. I'd like to discuss a GBP base with infrastructure-complexity adjustment and USD-denominated RSUs. A total package in the £160K-£191K ($200K-$238K equivalent) range reflects the multi-region infrastructure responsibility."*
   Dollar impact: +6-10% effective comp for global infrastructure scope.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In Greenwich CT, target $220K-$258K total comp by leading with your track record of building self-operating infrastructure and quantifying the operations headcount your automation has eliminated. In New York, push for $231K-$271K with the metro differential. In London, negotiate a dual-currency package targeting £160K-£191K ($200K-$238K equivalent) with global infrastructure scope as leverage. DevOps engineers at IBKR must demonstrate that they build infrastructure that operates itself — show that you have eliminated operations roles through automation, and you will command Automation-Leverage premium compensation.
