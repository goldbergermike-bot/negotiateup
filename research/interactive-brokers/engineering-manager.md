#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering management at Interactive Brokers is fundamentally different from engineering management at most financial institutions. IBKR's defining characteristic is extreme operational leverage — the company processes millions of trades daily with one of the smallest engineering organizations relative to revenue in the entire financial services industry. As an Engineering Manager, you are not being hired to grow a large team; you are being hired to maximize the output of a deliberately lean team. Your negotiation must reflect that your value is measured not in headcount managed but in headcount avoided.

The 32% year-over-year account growth creates an existential management challenge: how do you scale engineering output to match business growth without proportionally scaling team size? This is the core question IBKR's Engineering Managers must answer. ForecastEx, the company's Forecast Contracts platform, exemplifies this challenge — it represents an entirely new product vertical that must be delivered by small, high-performing teams. If you are interviewing for a role overseeing ForecastEx-adjacent teams, you are negotiating for one of the most impactful engineering management positions in fintech.

Thomas Peterffy's management philosophy is ruthlessly simple: hire fewer, better engineers and give them enormous scope. As an Engineering Manager, you are the custodian of this philosophy. Your job is to ensure each engineer on your team operates as a force multiplier. In negotiations, demonstrate that you have a track record of building small teams that deliver outsized results — this is the single most valuable credential you can bring to an IBKR EM interview.

#### ForecastEx — The Automation-Leverage Premium

- **What is ForecastEx?** ForecastEx is IBKR's Forecast Contracts platform for event-based trading and prediction markets. For Engineering Managers, ForecastEx represents the ultimate test of lean team management: delivering a globally-distributed, real-time trading platform with a fraction of the headcount competitors would deploy. EMs who oversee ForecastEx or related platform teams are eligible for the highest Automation-Leverage management premiums.

- **What are Automation-Leverage pay bands?** IBKR recognizes that Engineering Managers who maintain team output-to-headcount ratios significantly above industry norms deserve premium compensation. These Automation-Leverage bands sit 10-18% above standard fintech EM compensation. For an Engineering Manager, this translates to an additional $27K-$71K in total comp, pushing top-band TC from $392K toward $455K+ when the automation management premium is applied.

- **How does IBKR's automation-first culture redefine the EM role?** At most companies, Engineering Managers are measured by team growth — how many engineers they hire and manage. At IBKR, the metric is inverted: you are measured by how much your team delivers per engineer. This inversion is your negotiation leverage. Every process you automate, every workflow you eliminate, every system your team builds that runs without human intervention — these are the outputs that justify premium EM compensation at IBKR.

- **How to position yourself as a force multiplier:** In negotiations, reframe your management track record through IBKR's automation lens. Instead of "I managed a team of 25 engineers," say: "I led a team of 8 engineers that delivered output equivalent to a 25-person team by investing 40% of our capacity in automation and tooling. We reduced operational headcount requirements by 60% while increasing deployment velocity 3x." This is the language of Automation-Leverage management, and it will resonate deeply with IBKR hiring committees.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lean Team Management Premium** — IBKR's management philosophy rewards EMs who deliver more with fewer engineers. Negotiate a premium for your demonstrated ability to run lean.
   > *"My management philosophy aligns directly with IBKR's culture. At [Previous Company], I maintained a team of [X] engineers delivering output benchmarked against teams of [2-3X] at comparable firms. I'd like to discuss a base salary of $240K-$262K that reflects this lean management capability and the outsized per-engineer output I'll drive at IBKR."*
   Dollar impact: +$15K-$30K on base salary.

2. **Performance Bonus Tied to Automation Metrics** — Push for a bonus structure tied to team automation output rather than standard corporate metrics.
   > *"I'd like to discuss a bonus structure where a portion is tied to measurable automation outcomes — systems launched that reduce manual intervention, headcount efficiency improvements, or operational cost reductions. A target bonus of $45K-$50K with upside tied to these metrics would align my incentives with IBKR's automation-first values."*
   Dollar impact: +$10K-$20K on bonus.

3. **RSU Grant Reflecting Organizational Leverage** — Engineering Managers at IBKR create value through the teams they build. Negotiate RSUs reflecting team-level output.
   > *"The engineering team I'll build and lead at IBKR will directly influence platform scalability and revenue capacity. I'd like to discuss an RSU grant in the $72K-$80K/year range that reflects the organizational leverage of my role — each decision I make about team composition and technical direction will compound across the entire platform."*
   Dollar impact: +$12K-$22K annualized RSU value.

4. **London Management-Track Structuring** — For London EM roles, negotiate management-track compensation with dual-currency protection.
   > *"For the London-based role, I'd like to discuss a compensation structure that includes a GBP base salary with annual FX adjustment, USD-denominated RSUs aligned with IBKR's NASDAQ listing, and a performance bonus denominated in the currency that maximizes after-tax value. This structure ensures purchasing power alignment with Greenwich-based EM peers."*
   Dollar impact: +6-12% effective comp through structural optimization.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In Greenwich CT, target $340K-$392K total comp by framing yourself as a lean-team multiplier who maximizes output per engineer. In New York, push for $357K-$412K with the metro differential. In London, negotiate a dual-currency management package targeting £250K-£290K ($312K-$362K equivalent) with FX-protected base and USD RSUs. The key insight for EM negotiation at IBKR: you are not being evaluated on your ability to grow teams — you are being evaluated on your ability to make teams unnecessary. Lead with your track record of automation-driven team efficiency, and price yourself as a manager who saves IBKR millions in hiring costs.
