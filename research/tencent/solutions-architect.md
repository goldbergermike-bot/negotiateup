**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Tencent drive the company's cloud and enterprise expansion, particularly internationally. Tencent Cloud is a top-3 cloud provider in Asia-Pacific and is aggressively expanding into Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas. SAs design cloud architectures for gaming companies (leveraging Tencent's unmatched gaming infrastructure), media companies, and enterprises adopting WeChat/WeCom for business communication.

US-based SAs typically focus on gaming cloud solutions (game server hosting, real-time communication, CDN), enterprise cloud migrations, and partnerships with global technology companies. Compensation includes base, RSUs, and in some cases deal-influenced bonuses. Tencent Cloud's growth phase means SAs have significant impact on revenue trajectory.

**Level Mapping:** Solutions Architect at Tencent (T10-T11) = L5-L6 SA at Google Cloud, equivalent AWS SA, Principal SA at Microsoft

**The Gaming Cloud Premium**

Tencent's gaming expertise creates a unique SA advantage: no other cloud provider understands gaming infrastructure as deeply. SAs who can leverage Tencent's gaming technology to win cloud deals from competing gaming studios have extraordinary value.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cloud Provider SA Offer:** "I have an SA offer from [AWS/Google Cloud/Azure] at $[X] TC. Tencent Cloud's gaming expertise is differentiated, but I need competitive SA comp."
2. **Gaming Industry Relationships:** "My relationships with [gaming studios/publishers] directly accelerate Tencent Cloud's gaming vertical growth."
3. **Deal Revenue Impact:** "As an SA, I directly influence $[X]M+ in cloud deal pipeline. Compensation should reflect this revenue responsibility."
4. **International Expansion Value:** "My experience with [cloud architecture/international markets] accelerates Tencent Cloud's global expansion strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Tencent Cloud's gaming-first cloud strategy is compelling. I have a competing SA offer from [AWS/Google Cloud] at $[W]K TC. To choose Tencent, I need RSUs at $[Y+70K] and a $50K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
