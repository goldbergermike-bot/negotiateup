**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Tencent protect one of the most high-value attack surfaces in tech. WeChat Pay processes trillions of CNY annually -- any security breach would have catastrophic financial and reputational consequences. Tencent's gaming anti-cheat systems must protect competitive integrity across titles with hundreds of millions of players. Tencent Cloud offers security services (DDoS protection, WAF, threat intelligence) as a product line. This combination makes Tencent security engineering both a cost center (protecting existing products) and a revenue driver (cloud security products).

US-based security engineers typically focus on application security for gaming platforms, cloud security product development, or security research. Compensation is competitive with FAANG security engineering roles, reflecting the global shortage of security talent and the critical importance of security to Tencent's business.
