| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|

**Negotiation DNA**

Tencent is one of the world's most valuable technology companies, with a portfolio spanning social media (WeChat, QQ), gaming (the largest gaming company globally, with stakes in Riot Games, Epic Games, Supercell, and proprietary studios), cloud computing (Tencent Cloud), fintech (WeChat Pay), and AI. Software Engineers at Tencent's US offices work on gaming technology, AI/ML infrastructure, Tencent Cloud services, and international product development.

Tencent's US compensation is genuinely competitive with FAANG. The company's HR strategy for US offices explicitly benchmarks against Google, Meta, and Apple, with authority to match offers. RSU grants vest over four years with Tencent stock (listed on HKEX), and the company has demonstrated strong long-term stock appreciation. Bonuses in the US are 15-20%, lower than China's 20-40% performance-based bonuses but more predictable.

In China, Tencent is consistently ranked as one of the best-paying employers. The company's level system (recently restructured from T1-T17 to a simplified framework) determines comp bands, with most experienced SWEs at T9-T11. Chinese compensation includes base, stock, and performance bonuses heavily influenced by team and business unit profitability.

**Level Mapping:** Software Engineer at Tencent (T8-T10) = L3-L5 at Google, IC3-IC5 at Meta, SDE II-III at Amazon, equivalent ByteDance 2-1 to 2-2

**The Tencent Portfolio Premium**

Tencent's diversified portfolio creates unique opportunities for software engineers: you could work on gaming technology powering titles with hundreds of millions of players, WeChat infrastructure serving 1.3B users, or Tencent Cloud competing with AWS and Azure in the Asia-Pacific market. This breadth, combined with Tencent's strong profitability (consistently high margins driven by gaming and advertising), makes it one of the most financially stable employers in tech.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Meta/Apple] at $[X] TC. Tencent's engineering challenges are compelling, but I need the package to match the market."
2. **Gaming Technology Expertise:** "My experience with [game engine/real-time systems/distributed gaming infrastructure] directly applies to Tencent's gaming portfolio. This expertise commands $[X] at Epic, Riot, or Valve."
3. **Cloud Growth Impact:** "Tencent Cloud is in its high-growth phase. My [cloud infrastructure/distributed systems] experience directly accelerates this strategic priority."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A sign-on of $[40K-60K] would offset my unvested equity and is consistent with Tencent's competitive hiring practices."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Tencent's product breadth is impressive. I have a competing offer from [Google/Meta] at $[W]K TC. To choose Tencent, I need RSUs increased to $[Y+70K] and a $50K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
