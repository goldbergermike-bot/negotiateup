**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Tencent process data from one of the most diverse product ecosystems in tech. WeChat alone generates petabytes of interaction data daily from messaging, payments, social feeds, and mini-programs. Tencent's gaming division analyzes player behavior across titles with hundreds of millions of active users. Tencent Cloud offers managed data services (data warehousing, streaming, ETL) competing with AWS and Google Cloud. This breadth creates data engineering challenges that rival any company globally.

US-based data engineers at Tencent focus on gaming analytics infrastructure, Tencent Cloud data platform services, and AI/ML data pipelines. The compensation is benchmarked against FAANG data engineering roles, with competitive RSU grants and bonuses. Tencent has invested heavily in modernizing its data stack, adopting Spark, Flink, Kafka, and cloud-native data tools while maintaining proprietary systems built for WeChat's scale.
