**Negotiation DNA**

Tencent operates several world-class AI research groups: Tencent AI Lab (founded 2016, focused on NLP, computer vision, and reinforcement learning), WeChat AI (powering recommendation, search, and NLP within WeChat), and the recently expanded generative AI division. ML/AI Engineers at Tencent work on recommendation systems serving 1.3B WeChat users, game AI for the world's largest gaming portfolio, computer vision for Tencent's video platforms, and large language models competing with Baidu's ERNIE and Alibaba's Tongyi.

US-based AI engineers at Tencent focus on gaming AI (NPC behavior, procedural generation, anti-cheat), recommendation systems, and foundational AI research. Compensation explicitly targets Google Brain/DeepMind and Meta FAIR equivalents, with the company authorized to match offers from frontier AI labs. Tencent's publication record (top-tier venues like NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR) and the opportunity to deploy AI at WeChat's scale make it an attractive destination for research-minded engineers.

**Level Mapping:** ML/AI Engineer at Tencent (T9-T11) = L4-L5 at Google Brain, IC4-IC5 at Meta FAIR, Research Engineer at OpenAI/Anthropic, equivalent ByteDance AI Lab

**The AI at Scale Premium**

Tencent's AI advantage is the ability to deploy models to 1.3B WeChat users immediately. This deployment scale creates feedback loops that accelerate model improvement beyond what most companies can achieve. AI engineers at Tencent gain experience with production AI at a scale matched only by Google and Meta, making them highly sought after across the industry.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Lab Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google Brain/Meta FAIR/OpenAI] at $[X] TC. Tencent's deployment scale is exceptional, but I need the comp to reflect the AI talent market."
2. **Publication + Production:** "My combination of research publications ([venues]) and production ML experience is rare. This dual expertise commands $[X] at frontier AI labs."
3. **Gaming AI Innovation:** "My [reinforcement learning/procedural generation/game AI] expertise directly applies to Tencent's gaming portfolio -- the largest in the world."
4. **LLM Expertise:** "My experience with [LLM training/RLHF/prompt engineering/model optimization] is critical to Tencent's generative AI strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Deploying AI at WeChat's 1.3B-user scale is extraordinary. I have a competing offer from [Google Brain/OpenAI] at $[W]K TC. To choose Tencent, I need RSUs at $[Y+90K] and a $60K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
