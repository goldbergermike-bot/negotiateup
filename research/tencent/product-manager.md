**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Tencent's US offices define strategy for international products spanning gaming (the world's largest gaming company), cloud services (Tencent Cloud), and emerging platforms. US PMs operate with substantial autonomy, making product decisions for Western markets while coordinating with Chinese HQ on global strategy. Tencent has been expanding its PM function in the US, hiring experienced PMs from FAANG to bring Silicon Valley product discipline to its international operations.

Compensation is designed to be competitive with Google L5-L6 and Meta IC5-IC6 PM packages, with strong RSU grants and performance bonuses. The key differentiator for Tencent PM roles is the breadth of product opportunities: a PM could own a gaming franchise with 100M+ players, define Tencent Cloud's go-to-market strategy, or shape international features for WeChat-adjacent products.

**Level Mapping:** Product Manager at Tencent (T10-T11) = L5-L6 PM at Google, IC5-IC6 PM at Meta, Sr PM-Principal PM at Amazon

**The International Strategy Premium**

Tencent's international expansion is a top strategic priority, and US-based PMs are central to this effort. PMs who can navigate product-market fit across Western and Asian markets, adapt Chinese-market-proven products for international audiences, and define go-to-market strategy for gaming and cloud products have exceptional leverage.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG PM Offer:** "I have a PM offer from [Google/Meta] at $[X] TC. Tencent's product breadth is unmatched, and I expect PM comp to reflect that."
2. **International Strategy Expertise:** "My experience launching products across [US/European/Asian] markets directly accelerates Tencent's international expansion."
3. **Gaming Product Revenue:** "The gaming products I'd own generate $[X]B+ in annual revenue. This revenue responsibility justifies $[target TC]."
4. **Sign-On + Guaranteed Bonus:** "A $[50K-70K] sign-on and guaranteed first-year bonus reflect the competitive PM market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Defining product strategy for Tencent's international portfolio is compelling. I have a competing PM offer from [Google/Meta] at $[W]K TC. To choose Tencent, I need RSUs at $[Y+80K] and a $60K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
