**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Tencent shape experiences for the world's most feature-rich super-app (WeChat) and the planet's largest gaming portfolio. WeChat's design system must accommodate messaging, payments, social media, mini-programs, and enterprise tools within a single coherent experience -- a design challenge unmatched in complexity. US-based designers at Tencent typically work on international gaming UX, product design for Tencent's global initiatives, or UX research for cross-cultural product adaptation.

Compensation for designers at Tencent US offices is competitive with mid-to-senior design roles at FAANG, with RSU grants and performance bonuses. The company values designers who can bridge Western and Chinese UX sensibilities, making cross-cultural design experience a key differentiator.

**Level Mapping:** Product Designer at Tencent (T8-T10) = L4-L5 at Google, IC4-IC5 at Meta, ICT3-ICT4 at Apple, equivalent Spotify/Figma

**The Cross-Cultural Design Premium**

Tencent's products serve users across dramatically different cultural contexts: Chinese, Southeast Asian, European, and American markets. Designers who can create experiences that resonate across these cultures while maintaining coherent design systems are extraordinarily valuable.
