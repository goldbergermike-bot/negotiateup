### Product Designer — Nium Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Nium's Step Change infrastructure mandate, translating the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion into a product design compensation framework spanning Singapore, San Francisco, and London markets. As a Product Designer at Nium, you shape the interface between complex payments infrastructure and the humans who use it — creating dashboards, developer portals, API documentation experiences, and enterprise tools that make programmable money accessible and intuitive.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$90,000 - S$150,000 | S$40,000 - S$100,000 | S$130,000 - S$250,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $140,000 - $200,000 | $60,000 - $140,000 | $200,000 - $340,000 |
| London (GBP) | £60,000 - £100,000 | £30,000 - £70,000 | £90,000 - £170,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Designers at B2B infrastructure companies like Nium are systematically undervalued relative to their impact. The complexity of designing for payments infrastructure — where users include enterprise treasury teams, compliance officers, and developers building on Nium's APIs — demands a rare blend of systems thinking, technical fluency, and design craft. The Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion and Reimagined Infrastructure mandate have created urgency around developer experience and enterprise dashboard design, making this a strong negotiation window for designers who can demonstrate infrastructure design expertise.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Stripe | Scope |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Designer (L4) | Product Designer | UX Designer | Product Designer | Single product surface |
| Senior Designer (L5) | Senior Product Designer | Senior UX Designer | Senior Designer | Multi-surface ownership |
| Lead Designer (L6) | Design Lead | Lead Designer | Staff Designer | Design system + strategy |

Nium's design team is smaller than engineering, which means designers have outsized influence but also fewer internal peers for leveling benchmarks. Compare against Stripe (known for design excellence in infrastructure), Plaid, and Wise. Stripe pays at the premium end for infrastructure designers; Nium should target 85-95% of Stripe's total comp to be competitive given the pre-IPO equity opportunity.

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion — a **"step change"** that positioned the company to transform from a high-growth fintech into an enterprise-grade payments infrastructure platform. The **Reimagined Infrastructure** mandate is not just about backend systems — it explicitly includes reimagining how enterprises and developers interact with Nium's payment rails.

For a Product Designer, this step change creates specific leverage:

1. **Developer experience design**: The Reimagined Infrastructure includes new API products, developer portals, and documentation. Designers who specialize in developer experience (DevX) — creating intuitive API explorers, SDK documentation, and integration guides — are in exceptionally high demand across the infrastructure space.

2. **Scale-Architect visualization**: Nium's vision of **Scale-Architects** who bridge AI and programmable money requires designers who can make complex payment flows, routing logic, and compliance states visually comprehensible. This is not standard product design — it is infrastructure visualization, and the skill is rare.

3. **Enterprise dashboard transformation**: As Nium targets larger enterprise clients, the dashboard and back-office tools need to meet enterprise-grade UX expectations. Designers hired during the step change will define the entire enterprise experience layer.

4. **Design system foundation**: The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate offers designers the chance to build Nium's design system from the ground up — a career-defining opportunity that should be negotiated as a scope and title lever alongside compensation.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Infrastructure Design Scarcity**
> "Designers who can work at the infrastructure layer — developer portals, API documentation experiences, payment flow visualizations, and enterprise compliance dashboards — are genuinely scarce. Most designers gravitate toward consumer products. My experience designing for B2B infrastructure products is a scarce asset, and I'd like the compensation to reflect this specialization premium."

**Lever 2: Developer Experience Impact**
> "Nium's Reimagined Infrastructure mandate includes new developer-facing products and APIs. The quality of developer experience design directly impacts API adoption, integration time-to-value, and developer satisfaction scores. I've shipped developer experiences that improved [integration completion rates / time-to-first-transaction / developer NPS] by X%, and I'd like to discuss how this impact maps to the Senior/Lead band."

**Lever 3: Design System Ownership**
> "I understand Nium is rebuilding its product experience alongside the infrastructure. I'd like to discuss owning the design system as part of this role — establishing the foundational patterns, components, and design tokens that the entire product team builds on. This scope warrants Lead-level compensation and title."

**Lever 4: Competing Design Offers**
> "I'm evaluating design roles at [Stripe/Plaid/competing infrastructure company], where the total comp package is approximately $X. I'm excited about Nium's step-change moment and the opportunity to define the design language for Reimagined Infrastructure, but I need the package to be competitive with my alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$195,000 base + $135,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$330,000. Accept no lower than **$150,000 base + $75,000 options** ($225,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$145,000 base + S$95,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$100,000 base + S$50,000 options**. In London, start at **£95,000 base + £65,000 options** and accept no lower than **£68,000 base + £35,000 options**. Designers should also negotiate for design tooling budget, conference attendance, and design system ownership as non-monetary levers that increase role impact and future compensation trajectory.
