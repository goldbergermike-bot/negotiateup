### DevOps Engineer — Nium Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Nium's Step Change infrastructure mandate, translating the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion into a DevOps engineering compensation framework spanning Singapore, San Francisco, and London markets. As a DevOps Engineer at Nium, you are the operational backbone of the Reimagined Infrastructure — building CI/CD pipelines, managing cloud infrastructure, ensuring five-nines availability for global payment processing, and enabling engineering velocity across a rapidly scaling organization.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$100,000 - S$165,000 | S$50,000 - S$110,000 | S$150,000 - S$275,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $155,000 - $220,000 | $70,000 - S$160,000 | $225,000 - $380,000 |
| London (GBP) | £65,000 - £110,000 | £35,000 - £75,000 | £100,000 - £185,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: DevOps Engineers at payments infrastructure companies carry weight that far exceeds their title. When Nium's payment rails go down, enterprise clients lose millions in transaction volume. The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate following the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion means Nium is rebuilding its entire deployment and operational model — moving to modern cloud-native architectures, Kubernetes orchestration, infrastructure-as-code, and observability at global scale. DevOps Engineers who can architect and execute this transformation are in fierce demand, and the criticality of the role in a regulated financial services context commands a premium over standard SaaS DevOps compensation.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Stripe | Scope |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| DevOps Engineer (L4) | Infrastructure Engineer | DevOps Engineer | Site Reliability Eng | CI/CD, deployment |
| Senior DevOps (L5) | Senior Infra Engineer | Senior DevOps | Senior SRE | Platform ownership |
| Staff DevOps / SRE (L6) | Staff Infra | Lead DevOps / SRE | Staff SRE | Architecture + strategy |

Nium's DevOps function is evolving toward a Platform Engineering / SRE model as the company matures. Candidates should inquire whether the role is pure DevOps (CI/CD focus) or includes SRE/Platform Engineering responsibilities, as the latter commands 10-20% higher compensation. Compare against Stripe's SRE team (premium payer) and Wise's infrastructure team (public comp data available).

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion — a **"step change"** signaling the company's transformation from high-growth fintech to enterprise-grade payments infrastructure platform. The **Reimagined Infrastructure** mandate has direct and profound implications for DevOps engineering.

For a DevOps Engineer, this step change creates specific leverage:

1. **Infrastructure rebuild from the ground up**: The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate is not incremental improvement — it is a ground-up rebuild. DevOps Engineers will design new deployment architectures, observability stacks, disaster recovery systems, and infrastructure-as-code frameworks that define Nium's operational posture for years to come.

2. **Scale-Architect operational excellence**: Nium's **Scale-Architect** vision — bridging AI and programmable money — requires operational infrastructure that can handle millions of transactions per day with sub-second latency, automatic failover across regions, and compliance-aware deployment pipelines. DevOps Engineers who think at this level of operational sophistication are the operational expression of the Scale-Architect identity.

3. **Regulatory infrastructure complexity**: Payments infrastructure operates under stringent regulatory requirements — PCI DSS, SOC 2, MAS compliance (Singapore), FCA requirements (London), and state-by-state licensing (US). DevOps Engineers who can build compliant-by-default infrastructure pipelines are exceptionally valuable and rare.

4. **Availability = revenue**: In payments infrastructure, downtime directly translates to lost transaction volume and enterprise client penalties. DevOps Engineers who can demonstrate track records of achieving and maintaining five-nines availability in financial systems can command premium compensation by framing their work as revenue protection.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Financial Infrastructure Reliability Premium**
> "DevOps in payments infrastructure is fundamentally different from standard SaaS operations. Downtime doesn't just affect user experience — it blocks financial transactions and triggers regulatory scrutiny. My experience maintaining [X nines] availability for financial systems, with compliance-aware deployment pipelines, directly maps to your Reimagined Infrastructure requirements. I'm looking for compensation that reflects this financial infrastructure premium."

**Lever 2: Infrastructure Rebuild Ownership**
> "Your Reimagined Infrastructure mandate means you're rebuilding operational infrastructure from the ground up. I'm being hired to architect this new foundation — cloud strategy, Kubernetes orchestration, observability, disaster recovery — not to maintain existing systems. This is a Staff-level scope, and I'd like the compensation to reflect architectural ownership, not just operational execution."

**Lever 3: Compliance-Aware Infrastructure Expertise**
> "Building infrastructure that is compliant by default — PCI DSS, SOC 2, multi-jurisdictional regulatory requirements — requires specialized DevOps skills that most engineers don't have. I can build deployment pipelines that enforce compliance gates automatically, which reduces Nium's regulatory risk. I'd like a 15-20% premium to reflect this compliance infrastructure specialization."

**Lever 4: Competing Infrastructure Offers**
> "I'm evaluating SRE/DevOps roles at [Stripe/AWS/Google Cloud/competing company] with total compensation of $X. I'm excited about Nium's step-change infrastructure rebuild, but I need the package to be competitive with my alternatives, particularly on the equity side given the pre-IPO opportunity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$215,000 base + $155,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$370,000. Accept no lower than **$165,000 base + $85,000 options** ($250,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$160,000 base + S$105,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$110,000 base + S$60,000 options**. In London, start at **£105,000 base + £70,000 options** and accept no lower than **£72,000 base + £40,000 options**. DevOps Engineers should also negotiate for on-call compensation structures, infrastructure tooling budgets, and certification support (AWS/GCP/K8s) as non-monetary levers.
