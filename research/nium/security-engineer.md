### Security Engineer — Nium Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Nium's Step Change infrastructure mandate, translating the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion into a security engineering compensation framework spanning Singapore, San Francisco, and London markets. As a Security Engineer at Nium, you are the guardian of the payments infrastructure — protecting billions of dollars in cross-border transactions from fraud, breaches, and regulatory non-compliance. In a company whose entire value proposition is trusted money movement, security is not a support function; it is the product.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$120,000 - S$190,000 | S$70,000 - S$150,000 | S$190,000 - S$340,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $175,000 - $250,000 | $90,000 - $200,000 | $265,000 - $450,000 |
| London (GBP) | £75,000 - £125,000 | £45,000 - £90,000 | £120,000 - £215,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers at payments infrastructure companies occupy a uniquely leveraged position. A single security incident at Nium could compromise enterprise client trust, trigger regulatory enforcement across multiple jurisdictions, and jeopardize the company's license portfolio. The Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion and Reimagined Infrastructure mandate amplify this leverage — as Nium rebuilds its infrastructure from the ground up, security must be architected in from day one, not bolted on afterward. Security Engineers who understand both offensive and defensive security in the context of financial systems, combined with multi-jurisdictional regulatory compliance (PCI DSS, SOC 2, MAS TRM, FCA requirements), are among the scarcest talent categories in fintech.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Stripe | Scope |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Security Engineer (L4) | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Application/infra security |
| Senior Security (L5) | Senior Security | Senior Security Eng | Senior Security Eng | Security architecture |
| Staff Security (L6) | Lead Security | Principal Security | Staff Security Eng | Security strategy |

Security Engineer compensation in fintech commands a 15-25% premium over general tech security roles due to regulatory complexity and the financial impact of incidents. Candidates should benchmark against Stripe (premium security team), JPMorgan (banking security compensation), and dedicated cybersecurity firms like CrowdStrike or Palo Alto Networks. Nium's pre-IPO options add significant upside that mature security companies and banks cannot match.

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion — a **"step change"** signaling the company's transformation from high-growth fintech to enterprise-grade payments infrastructure platform. The **Reimagined Infrastructure** mandate has profound security implications.

For a Security Engineer, this step change creates specific leverage:

1. **Security-by-design architecture**: The Reimagined Infrastructure is being built from the ground up, which means security architecture decisions made now will be embedded in Nium's DNA for years. Security Engineers hired during this phase are not patching legacy systems — they are defining the security posture of a next-generation payments platform.

2. **Scale-Architect security thinking**: Nium's **Scale-Architect** vision — bridging AI and programmable money — introduces new attack surfaces: AI model manipulation, programmable payment exploitation, and automated fraud at machine speed. Security Engineers who can think at the intersection of AI security and financial system protection embody the Scale-Architect identity and command premium compensation.

3. **Multi-jurisdictional compliance**: Nium operates under regulatory oversight in 100+ countries. Security Engineers must ensure compliance with PCI DSS, SOC 2 Type II, MAS Technology Risk Management Guidelines (Singapore), FCA cyber resilience requirements (UK), and state-level regulations (US). This multi-regulatory complexity is a significant premium factor.

4. **Enterprise trust enablement**: As Nium pursues larger enterprise clients, security posture becomes a sales enabler. Security Engineers who can support enterprise security reviews, penetration test responses, and compliance certifications directly contribute to revenue growth.

5. **IPO security readiness**: The C-Suite expansion signals potential IPO preparation, which requires SOX compliance, enhanced audit trails, and rigorous security governance — all programs that Security Engineers lead.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Financial Infrastructure Security Premium**
> "Security in payments infrastructure is fundamentally different from SaaS security. I'm protecting billions of dollars in transaction flow across 100+ regulatory jurisdictions. A breach at Nium doesn't just cause data loss — it triggers regulatory enforcement, license revocation risk, and enterprise client attrition. I'm looking for compensation that reflects this critical-infrastructure security premium — specifically 20-25% above standard tech security packages."

**Lever 2: Security-by-Design for Reimagined Infrastructure**
> "Your Reimagined Infrastructure mandate is a once-in-a-company opportunity to build security into the platform architecture from day one. I bring experience in designing security architectures for financial systems at scale — threat modeling, zero-trust architecture, encryption-at-rest and in-transit, and compliance-as-code. This is Staff-level security architecture work, and I'd like the compensation to match."

**Lever 3: Multi-Regulatory Compliance Expertise**
> "Maintaining security compliance across PCI DSS, SOC 2, MAS TRM, FCA requirements, and multiple jurisdictional frameworks simultaneously requires specialized expertise. My [X years] of multi-regulatory security experience means I can navigate these requirements without an extended ramp period. This compliance-security specialization commands a premium."

**Lever 4: Competing Security Offers**
> "I'm evaluating security roles at [Stripe/JPMorgan/CrowdStrike/competing company] with total compensation of $X. Nium's step-change moment and the opportunity to architect security for the Reimagined Infrastructure are compelling, but I need the total package to be competitive with financial services and Big Tech security compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$245,000 base + $195,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$440,000. Accept no lower than **$190,000 base + $105,000 options** ($295,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$185,000 base + S$145,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$130,000 base + S$80,000 options**. In London, start at **£120,000 base + £85,000 options** and accept no lower than **£82,000 base + £50,000 options**. Security Engineers should emphasize the risk-mitigation value they provide — frame your compensation ask in terms of breach costs avoided and regulatory penalties prevented, which dwarf salary costs.
