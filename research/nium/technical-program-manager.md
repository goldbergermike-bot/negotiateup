### Technical Program Manager — Nium Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Nium's Step Change infrastructure mandate, translating the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion into a technical program management compensation framework spanning Singapore, San Francisco, and London markets. As a Technical Program Manager at Nium, you are the execution engine behind the Reimagined Infrastructure — coordinating multi-team programs, managing dependencies across payment systems, and ensuring that complex cross-border infrastructure projects ship on time and within regulatory constraints.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$130,000 - S$195,000 | S$70,000 - S$150,000 | S$200,000 - S$345,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $175,000 - S$245,000 | $90,000 - $190,000 | $265,000 - $435,000 |
| London (GBP) | £80,000 - £125,000 | £45,000 - £85,000 | £125,000 - £210,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Technical Program Managers are force multipliers at infrastructure companies, and their value increases exponentially during periods of transformation. Nium's Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion and Reimagined Infrastructure mandate have created a surge of complex, multi-quarter programs that require experienced TPMs to coordinate across engineering, product, compliance, and operations. TPMs who understand payments infrastructure — with its regulatory gates, settlement dependencies, and multi-jurisdictional launch requirements — are scarce and command premium compensation. The step change also means TPMs will have unusual organizational visibility, working directly with new C-Suite leaders to execute their strategic vision.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Stripe | Scope |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| TPM (L5) | Program Manager | Technical PM | TPM | Single program stream |
| Senior TPM (L6) | Senior PM | Senior TPM | Senior TPM | Multi-program portfolio |
| Principal TPM (L7) | Lead PM | Head of PMO | Staff TPM | Strategic programs |

Nium's TPM function is growing as the company scales. Candidates should benchmark against Stripe (strong TPM culture), Google (industry-leading TPM compensation), and Wise. TPM compensation at Nium should be 90-100% of equivalent engineering IC compensation at the same level — if TPM comp is discounted versus IC comp, that gap is a negotiation target.

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion — a **"step change"** that signaled the company's transformation from high-growth fintech to enterprise-grade payments infrastructure platform. The **Reimagined Infrastructure** mandate has created a portfolio of complex programs that need experienced TPMs to drive to completion.

For a Technical Program Manager, this step change creates specific leverage:

1. **Multi-quarter program ownership**: The Reimagined Infrastructure is not a single project — it is a portfolio of interconnected programs spanning payment routing, compliance automation, platform reliability, API redesign, and regulatory launches. TPMs who can manage this portfolio-level complexity are essential to execution.

2. **Scale-Architect program orchestration**: Nium's **Scale-Architect** vision — bridging AI and programmable money — requires programs that coordinate across engineering, data science, product, and compliance teams. TPMs serve as the connective tissue, ensuring that the technical vision translates into coordinated delivery.

3. **C-Suite execution partner**: New C-Suite leaders need TPMs who can translate strategic mandates into executable programs with clear milestones, dependencies, and risk mitigation. TPMs hired during this window become trusted execution partners with direct leadership access.

4. **Regulatory program complexity**: Payments infrastructure programs must navigate regulatory gates in every jurisdiction — license applications, compliance reviews, audit requirements, and data residency constraints. TPMs with fintech regulatory program experience are rare and valuable.

5. **IPO readiness programs**: The C-Suite expansion signals potential IPO preparation, which itself generates complex programs — SOX compliance, financial systems hardening, audit readiness. TPMs who can manage IPO-related programs alongside the Reimagined Infrastructure portfolio are doubly valuable.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Infrastructure Transformation Program Expertise**
> "The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate is a multi-year, multi-team transformation program — exactly the kind of complex program I've managed before. In my previous role, I led a $X million infrastructure modernization program across Y teams in Z geographies. I'd like the compensation to reflect my ability to drive this level of program complexity at Nium."

**Lever 2: Payments Regulatory Program Management**
> "Payments infrastructure programs operate under regulatory constraints that most TPMs have never encountered — license applications, compliance gates, data residency requirements, and multi-jurisdictional launch sequences. My experience navigating these regulatory program requirements is a scarce skill, and I'd like a 15% premium above standard TPM compensation to reflect it."

**Lever 3: TPM-to-IC Parity**
> "I've noticed that TPM compensation at some companies is discounted 10-20% versus engineering IC compensation at equivalent levels. At Nium, TPMs are driving the Reimagined Infrastructure execution — our impact is equivalent to Staff-level ICs. I'd like the compensation package to reflect IC parity at my level."

**Lever 4: Competing TPM Offers**
> "I'm evaluating TPM roles at [Google/Stripe/Meta/competing company] with total compensation in the $X range. Nium's step-change transformation and the scope of the Reimagined Infrastructure program portfolio are uniquely compelling, but I need the package to be competitive with my Big Tech alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$240,000 base + $185,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$425,000. Accept no lower than **$190,000 base + $105,000 options** ($295,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$190,000 base + S$145,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$140,000 base + S$80,000 options**. In London, start at **£120,000 base + £80,000 options** and accept no lower than **£87,000 base + £50,000 options**. TPMs should anchor negotiations around IC parity — if Senior SWEs at Nium earn $X, Senior TPMs should earn within 5-10% of that figure.
