#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$200,000 - S$300,000 | S$200,000 - S$450,000 | S$400,000 - S$750,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $260,000 - $350,000 | $250,000 - $500,000 | $510,000 - $850,000 |
| London (GBP) | £140,000 - £200,000 | £120,000 - £250,000 | £260,000 - £450,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Scale-Architect Platform Engineer sits at the apex of Nium's technical talent pyramid. This role demands an engineer who can simultaneously think at the level of individual payment transactions (latency, reliability, correctness) and global system architecture (multi-region deployment, regulatory compliance across jurisdictions, FX risk management, and AI-driven orchestration). The Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion was designed to attract exactly this caliber of talent — leaders who recognize that Nium's Reimagined Infrastructure mandate requires Scale-Architects who don't just build platforms, but reimagine what a payments platform can be.

The compensation benchmarks reflect this role's unique position: it maps to Staff-to-Principal level at Big Tech companies, but with pre-IPO equity upside that could multiply the total compensation by 3-5x in a successful public offering. Candidates should negotiate aggressively on both base salary and equity, understanding that Nium's ability to attract Scale-Architect talent is existential to the Reimagined Infrastructure initiative.

---

#### Why This Is the SIGNATURE ROLE

The Scale-Architect Platform Engineer is the SIGNATURE ROLE for Nium because it represents the purest expression of the company's strategic direction:

1. **It is the role the step change was designed to create.** The Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion was not about filling existing positions — it was about creating a leadership structure capable of attracting and empowering Scale-Architects who can reimagine payments infrastructure from the ground up.

2. **It bridges the company's two defining capabilities.** Nium's competitive advantage lies at the intersection of global payments licensing (190+ countries) and modern technology infrastructure. The Scale-Architect Platform Engineer is the role that fuses these capabilities into a coherent, scalable platform.

3. **It embodies the AI + Programmable Money thesis.** Nium's future depends on making money programmable — enabling enterprises to embed payment intelligence into their applications via APIs. The Scale-Architect Platform Engineer builds the infrastructure that makes this possible.

4. **It is the hardest role to fill.** Engineers who combine deep platform engineering expertise, payments domain knowledge, AI/ML systems experience, and the architectural vision to design for global scale are among the rarest professionals in technology. This scarcity translates directly to negotiation leverage.

5. **It defines the technical ceiling.** Every other engineering role at Nium operates within the architectural boundaries set by the Scale-Architect Platform Engineer. This role's decisions about system design, technology choices, and scalability patterns will constrain or enable the entire organization for years.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Google | Equivalent at Adyen |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Scale-Architect (L7) | Staff Engineer | Principal Engineer | L4 Staff Engineer | L6 Staff SWE | Senior Staff Engineer |
| Scale-Architect Senior (L7+) | Senior Staff | Distinguished Eng | L4 Senior Staff | L6 Senior Staff | Principal Engineer |
| Scale-Architect Principal (L8) | Principal / Fellow | VP Engineering | L5 Principal | L7 Principal | Distinguished Engineer |

**Detailed Competitor Benchmarking:**

- **Stripe L4 Staff Platform Engineer (SF)**: $450,000-$750,000 total comp. Stripe is the primary competitor for this talent. Their platform engineering team is considered the gold standard in payments infrastructure. Nium must compete on equity upside (pre-IPO) and architectural scope (Reimagined Infrastructure offers more greenfield design opportunity than Stripe's mature platform).

- **Google L6 Staff SWE (SF)**: $500,000-$850,000 total comp. Google offers higher guaranteed compensation but less domain-specific impact. The Scale-Architect at Nium shapes an entire industry's infrastructure; an L6 at Google works within established systems.

- **Adyen Senior Staff Engineer (Amsterdam/SF)**: $350,000-$600,000 total comp. Adyen is the closest public-company analog to Nium. Their compensation is strong but their platform is mature — less greenfield opportunity. Nium's Reimagined Infrastructure mandate offers more architectural freedom.

- **Wise Staff Engineer (London)**: £200,000-£350,000 total comp. Public company with transparent compensation. Nium's pre-IPO equity could significantly exceed Wise's RSU grants if the IPO trajectory materializes.

- **Airwallex Principal Engineer (Singapore)**: S$300,000-$550,000 total comp. Closest private-company competitor in the APAC payments space. Comparable equity risk/reward profile, but Nium's broader licensing footprint (190+ countries vs. Airwallex's more limited coverage) offers larger platform scope.

Candidates should request a detailed equity package walkthrough: total shares outstanding, latest 409A valuation (or equivalent FMV), strike price, secondary market pricing (if available), and preferred stock overhang. At this level, the equity component is often 40-60% of total compensation value, making these details essential to accurate package evaluation.

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion that included new executive hires across engineering, product, operations, and go-to-market functions. This was not an incremental hiring cycle — it was a deliberate **"step change"** signaling Nium's transformation from a high-growth fintech startup into a scalable, enterprise-grade payments infrastructure platform.

The **Reimagined Infrastructure** mandate is the technical and strategic heart of this transformation. It represents a ground-up rebuild of Nium's payments stack to support:

- **Programmable money**: APIs that allow enterprises to embed payment intelligence directly into their applications
- **AI-driven orchestration**: ML models that intelligently route payments across corridors, optimize FX costs, predict settlement times, and detect fraud in real-time
- **Global scale**: Infrastructure that processes millions of transactions daily across 100+ countries with sub-second latency and five-nines reliability
- **Regulatory compliance at infrastructure depth**: Compliance-as-code that automatically enforces regulatory requirements across every jurisdiction

For the Scale-Architect Platform Engineer — the SIGNATURE ROLE — this step change is transformative:

**1. Architectural Genesis Authority**

The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate means the Scale-Architect Platform Engineer will make foundational architectural decisions that define Nium's technical platform for the next decade. This is not incremental improvement — it is designing and building a new category of payments infrastructure from scratch. Decisions about:
- Event-driven vs. request-response architecture patterns
- Multi-region data replication and consistency models
- API gateway design and rate limiting at global scale
- Payment routing engine architecture
- Compliance orchestration layer design
- Real-time settlement pipeline architecture
- Feature store and ML serving infrastructure

These decisions will be load-bearing for years. This level of architectural authority is extraordinarily rare — comparable to the foundational architecture decisions at Stripe (2012-2014), AWS (2004-2006), or Adyen (2009-2011). Candidates should frame this opportunity in negotiations: "I am being hired to make the same class of architectural decisions that defined Stripe's platform — and the compensation should reflect that historical parallel."

**2. Scale-Architect Identity and Organizational Influence**

The Scale-Architect Platform Engineer is the living embodiment of Nium's **Scale-Architect** vision — the professional who bridges AI and programmable money. This is not just a role description; it is an organizational identity that carries weight across the company:
- Direct partnership with C-Suite leadership on technical strategy
- Influence over engineering hiring profiles and team structure
- Ownership of the technology radar and architecture decision records
- Authority to define platform engineering standards and practices
- Voice in build-vs-buy decisions for core infrastructure components

This organizational influence is a non-monetary benefit worth negotiating for explicitly. Candidates should request: architecture review board chairmanship, technology strategy committee membership, and formal input into the engineering hiring process.

**3. Pre-IPO Equity at Maximum Leverage**

The C-Suite expansion is widely interpreted as IPO preparation. Scale-Architect Platform Engineers receive among the largest individual contributor option grants in the company — typically 2-5x the grant of a standard Senior SWE. Combined with pre-IPO pricing, the equity component of this role's compensation has enormous upside potential:

- **Conservative scenario (2x appreciation)**: A $400,000 option grant becomes $800,000 over 4 years
- **Base scenario (3x appreciation)**: A $400,000 option grant becomes $1,200,000 over 4 years
- **Aggressive scenario (5x appreciation)**: A $400,000 option grant becomes $2,000,000 over 4 years

Candidates should model these scenarios explicitly during negotiations and use them to justify accepting a slightly lower base in exchange for a larger option grant. However, never accept a base below your floor — equity upside is probabilistic, while base salary is guaranteed.

**4. The Invisible Backbone Narrative**

Nium's infrastructure layer is the invisible backbone connecting global payments. Enterprise clients don't see Nium's platform — they see their own payment capabilities. But every transaction, every currency conversion, every compliance check flows through Nium's infrastructure. The Scale-Architect Platform Engineer builds this invisible backbone.

This narrative is a powerful negotiation tool because it positions the role as foundational to the entire company's revenue. Every dollar Nium processes flows through infrastructure designed by the Scale-Architect. This direct revenue dependency justifies premium compensation.

**5. Transformation from Startup to Enterprise-Grade**

The step change represents Nium's transformation from startup to enterprise-grade infrastructure platform. The Scale-Architect Platform Engineer is the role that makes this transformation real — converting executive ambition into production-grade systems. This transformation expertise is itself a premium skill: engineers who have successfully navigated the startup-to-enterprise transition at companies like Stripe, Square, or Plaid command premium compensation because they understand both the technical and organizational challenges of this evolution.

#### Global Levers (Extended for SIGNATURE ROLE)

**Lever 1: Architectural Genesis Premium**
> "I'm being hired to make foundational architectural decisions for Nium's Reimagined Infrastructure — the same class of decisions that defined Stripe's platform in its early years. These decisions will be load-bearing for a decade and will constrain or enable every engineering team at Nium. This is not Staff-level feature delivery — it is Principal-level architectural genesis. I'm looking for compensation at the top of your Scale-Architect band, with the equity grant reflecting the fact that my architectural decisions will directly determine the scalability and value of the platform you're building."

**Lever 2: Scale-Architect Scarcity Multiplier**
> "Engineers who combine deep platform engineering expertise, cross-border payments domain knowledge, AI/ML systems experience, and the vision to design for global scale across 100+ regulatory jurisdictions are among the rarest professionals in technology. I've spent my career building exactly this intersection of skills. My compensation should reflect this extreme scarcity — I'm benchmarking against Principal-level platform engineers at Stripe and Staff+ ML infrastructure engineers at Google, where total comp ranges from $500K to $850K."

**Lever 3: Pre-IPO Equity Maximization at Architect Scale**
> "Given the Feb 12 C-Suite expansion and what it signals about Nium's IPO trajectory, I want to structure my package with significant equity weighting. I'm willing to accept a base at $X if we can agree on an options grant of $Y over 4 years — targeting the upper end of your Scale-Architect band. I want to model the equity at 2x, 3x, and 5x the current 409A valuation, and I'd like transparency on total shares outstanding, latest valuation, and any secondary market activity."

**Lever 4: Big Tech Opportunity Cost with Domain Premium**
> "To be transparent, I'm weighing this against Staff/Principal offers at [Google/Stripe/Meta] with total compensation in the $X-$Y range. What draws me to Nium is the Reimagined Infrastructure mandate — the opportunity to architect a global payments platform from the ground up is career-defining. But I need the total package to be within 15% of my Big Tech alternative, with the difference made up in pre-IPO options. I also expect the base to be at least $Z to reflect the financial infrastructure premium."

**Lever 5: Revenue Infrastructure Ownership**
> "Every dollar Nium processes — every transaction, every currency conversion, every settlement — flows through the platform infrastructure I will design and build. This direct revenue dependency means my architectural decisions have P&L impact measured in hundreds of millions of dollars annually. I'd like the compensation to reflect this revenue-infrastructure ownership, including a base at the top of band and equity that aligns my long-term incentives with Nium's growth."

**Lever 6: Organizational Influence Package**
> "Beyond compensation, I'd like to negotiate the organizational influence package for this role. Specifically: architecture review board chairmanship, technology strategy committee membership, formal input into engineering hiring for my platform domain, conference speaking budget, open-source contribution time (10-15% of capacity), and a clear path to Principal/Distinguished Engineer title within 24 months as the Reimagined Infrastructure scales."

**Lever 7: Retention and Acceleration Clauses**
> "I'd like to discuss retention and acceleration provisions for the equity grant. Specifically: a 1-year cliff with monthly vesting thereafter, double-trigger acceleration in the event of acquisition, and a retention bonus at the 2-year mark that reflects the strategic importance of continuity in the Scale-Architect role during the Reimagined Infrastructure buildout."

**Lever 8: Multi-Market Compensation Optimization**
> "Given Nium's presence in Singapore, San Francisco, and London, I'd like to discuss location-flexible compensation. If the role can be based in [preferred location], I'd like the compensation to reflect local market rates for Scale-Architect talent rather than a blanket geographic discount. I'm also interested in a formal relocation/mobility package that preserves compensation levels if I'm asked to transfer between offices."

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — final authority on platform-level technical decisions
- Technology Radar — ownership of Nium's technology evaluation and adoption framework
- Platform Engineering Standards — defining code, API, and infrastructure standards for the org
- Build vs. Buy Decisions — evaluating and recommending vendor vs. internal solutions for infrastructure components

**Organizational Scope (negotiate explicitly):**
- Number of engineers influenced (direct reports, platform consumers, cross-functional partners)
- Budget authority for infrastructure spend
- Hiring influence for platform engineering team
- C-Suite access cadence (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)

---

#### Compensation Negotiation Playbook (SIGNATURE ROLE Extended)

**Phase 1: Pre-Negotiation Research (Before First Conversation)**
- Gather competing offers or credible market data from Stripe, Google, Adyen, Wise
- Model Nium's equity at 2x, 3x, and 5x current 409A valuation
- Prepare a 1-page "Platform Vision" document showing your architectural thinking for Reimagined Infrastructure (this demonstrates Scale-Architect identity and increases perceived value)
- Research the new C-Suite leaders' backgrounds and strategic priorities

**Phase 2: Initial Compensation Discussion**
- Lead with enthusiasm for the Reimagined Infrastructure mandate and Feb 12 step change
- Share your total compensation target (anchor high): "I'm targeting total compensation in the $X range, weighted toward equity given the pre-IPO opportunity"
- Present your Platform Vision document to demonstrate architectural authority
- Ask about equity details: total shares outstanding, 409A valuation, strike price, secondary pricing

**Phase 3: Offer Evaluation**
- Compare against your floor (see Negotiate Up Strategy below)
- Model equity scenarios at multiple valuations
- Evaluate organizational scope against your expectations
- Assess the total package: base + options + signing bonus + organizational influence

**Phase 4: Counter-Offer**
- If below floor: "I appreciate the offer, but based on my market research and the competing packages I'm evaluating, I need the total compensation to be at $X to move forward. I'm flexible on the base-equity split."
- If near target: "The offer is in the right range. I'd like to negotiate two adjustments: [increase equity by 20%] and [add architectural scope for X domain]."
- If at target: "The compensation is competitive. I'd like to finalize the organizational scope — specifically, architecture review board ownership and a clear path to Principal/Distinguished title."

**Phase 5: Final Negotiation**
- Negotiate signing bonus (common for Scale-Architect level: $30,000-$75,000)
- Negotiate equity refresh timeline and criteria
- Secure double-trigger acceleration in writing
- Lock in organizational influence commitments (ARB ownership, tech strategy committee, C-Suite access)

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: This is the SIGNATURE ROLE — negotiate accordingly. In San Francisco, start your ask at **$340,000 base + $480,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$820,000. Accept no lower than **$275,000 base + $280,000 options** ($555,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$290,000 base + S$430,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$215,000 base + S$220,000 options** (S$435,000 floor). In London, start at **£195,000 base + £240,000 options** and accept no lower than **£150,000 base + £135,000 options** (£285,000 floor). Additionally, negotiate a signing bonus of **$50,000-$75,000** (or regional equivalent), double-trigger acceleration, and an equity refresh at the 2-year mark. The Scale-Architect Platform Engineer is the single most important IC hire in Nium's Reimagined Infrastructure initiative — negotiate like it.
