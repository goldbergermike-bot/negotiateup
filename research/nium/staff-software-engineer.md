### Staff Software Engineer — Nium Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Nium's Step Change infrastructure mandate, translating the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion into a staff-level engineering compensation framework spanning Singapore, San Francisco, and London markets. As a Staff Software Engineer at Nium, you are an architectural authority — the engineer who sets technical direction for entire domains within the payments platform and ensures that Nium's Reimagined Infrastructure vision translates into production-grade reality.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$180,000 - S$260,000 | S$150,000 - S$300,000 | S$330,000 - S$560,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $240,000 - $310,000 | $200,000 - $400,000 | $440,000 - $710,000 |
| London (GBP) | £120,000 - £170,000 | £100,000 - £200,000 | £220,000 - £370,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Staff Engineers at Nium occupy a uniquely powerful position during the Reimagined Infrastructure transformation. You are the bridge between executive vision and engineering execution — the person who translates the C-Suite's step-change ambitions into technical strategies, system boundaries, and architecture decision records. Following the Feb 12, 2026 leadership expansion, Nium's new engineering leadership needs Staff-level partners who can independently drive multi-quarter technical initiatives across payment routing, compliance automation, and real-time settlement. The supply of Staff Engineers with cross-border payments domain expertise is extremely thin, giving you outsized negotiation leverage. Nium must compete with Stripe (Staff/L4), Adyen, Wise, and Big Tech for this talent — and your alternatives are credible and numerous.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Google |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Staff SWE (L7) | Staff Engineer | Principal Engineer | L4 Staff Engineer | L6 Staff SWE |
| Staff SWE (L7+) | Senior Staff | Distinguished Engineer | L4 Senior Staff | L6 Senior Staff |

Staff Engineer is where Nium's leveling aligns most closely with Big Tech expectations. At this level, you should be benchmarking against Stripe L4 ($450K-$700K+ total comp in SF), Google L6 ($500K-$800K+), and Wise Staff (£150K-£250K+ in London). Nium's base salary will likely be 15-25% below Big Tech, but pre-IPO option grants can close or exceed this gap if the company's trajectory continues toward a public offering. Candidates should insist on a detailed understanding of the current 409A valuation (or equivalent fair market value), total shares outstanding, and the implied option value at recent secondary market pricing.

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion that included new executive hires across engineering, product, operations, and go-to-market. This was not incremental growth — it was a deliberate **"step change"** signaling Nium's transformation from a high-growth fintech startup into a scalable, enterprise-grade payments infrastructure platform.

The **Reimagined Infrastructure** mandate is the centerpiece of this transformation: a ground-up rebuild of Nium's payments stack to support programmable money, AI-driven orchestration, embedded finance at scale, and real-time settlement across every corridor. This is not a refactoring project — it is an architecture moonshot.

For a Staff Software Engineer, this step change creates extraordinary leverage:

1. **Architectural authority**: Staff Engineers will define the system boundaries, API contracts, data models, and reliability standards for the Reimagined Infrastructure. Decisions made now will be load-bearing for a decade. This level of influence is rare outside of founding-stage companies.

2. **Scale-Architect identity**: Nium is explicitly seeking **Scale-Architects** — engineers who bridge AI and programmable money, who think about systems that must process millions of daily transactions while adapting to regulatory changes across 100+ jurisdictions in real-time. Staff Engineers are the natural embodiment of this Scale-Architect vision, and candidates who adopt this framing in negotiations signal strategic alignment with the company's direction.

3. **Direct C-Suite partnership**: The new executive team needs Staff-level technical partners to validate and execute their vision. This means Staff Engineers hired now will have unusual access to leadership and influence over company direction — a non-monetary benefit worth negotiating for explicitly (e.g., architecture review board membership, tech radar ownership).

4. **IPO-proximate equity**: The leadership expansion is widely interpreted as IPO preparation. Staff-level option grants are typically 2-4x the size of Senior SWE grants, meaning the absolute dollar upside from a successful IPO is substantial. Candidates should model option value at 2x, 3x, and 5x the current 409A valuation.

5. **Title and scope negotiation**: Because Nium's leveling is still maturing, Staff Engineer candidates have room to negotiate scope explicitly — owning a domain (e.g., "Staff Engineer, Payment Routing" or "Staff Engineer, Platform Infrastructure") rather than being slotted generically.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Architectural Authority Premium**
> "At the Staff level, I'm not joining to ship features — I'm joining to define the architecture of your Reimagined Infrastructure. My track record includes designing systems that handle [X million TPS / Y billion in annual volume / Z nine of reliability], and I expect the compensation to reflect architectural ownership, not just individual contribution. I'm targeting the upper end of your Staff band."

**Lever 2: Scarcity of Payments-Domain Staff Engineers**
> "Staff Engineers who understand cross-border payment systems at infrastructure depth — settlement networks, FX hedging, regulatory orchestration, and multi-corridor routing — are exceptionally rare. I've spent [X years] building exactly this expertise. I'd like the base and equity to reflect this scarcity premium, which I've benchmarked at 20-30% above your standard Staff SWE offer."

**Lever 3: Big Tech Opportunity Cost**
> "To be transparent, I'm weighing this against a Staff/L6 offer at [Google/Meta/Stripe] with total compensation of $X. I'm genuinely more excited about Nium's step-change moment and the opportunity to shape the Reimagined Infrastructure, but I need the total package to be within 10-15% of my Big Tech alternative — and I'd like the difference made up in pre-IPO options."

**Lever 4: Scope and Title Structuring**
> "I'd like to discuss how we define the Staff Engineer role scope. I'm specifically interested in owning the [payment routing / platform infrastructure / compliance automation] domain, with a title that reflects that ownership. I'd also like to discuss architecture review board participation and my involvement in the technical roadmap for the Reimagined Infrastructure initiative."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$305,000 base + $380,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$685,000. Accept no lower than **$250,000 base + $220,000 options** ($470,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$255,000 base + S$280,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$190,000 base + S$165,000 options**. In London, start at **£165,000 base + £190,000 options** and accept no lower than **£125,000 base + £110,000 options**. At the Staff level, negotiate equity aggressively — the option grant is where the real value lives in a pre-IPO company. Insist on understanding total shares outstanding, latest 409A valuation, and any secondary market pricing.
