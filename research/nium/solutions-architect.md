#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$140,000 - S$210,000 | S$80,000 - S$170,000 | S$220,000 - S$380,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $180,000 - $255,000 | $100,000 - S$200,000 | $280,000 - $455,000 |
| London (GBP) | £85,000 - £135,000 | £50,000 - £100,000 | £135,000 - £235,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Solutions Architects at Nium sit at the revenue-critical intersection of technical depth and client relationships. Every enterprise deal that Nium closes requires a Solutions Architect to design the integration, validate the technical feasibility, and ensure the client can process payments through Nium's infrastructure at scale. The Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion and Reimagined Infrastructure mandate are expanding Nium's enterprise ambitions, which means more complex deals, larger clients, and higher-stakes integrations — all requiring Solutions Architects who can think across payments corridors, compliance regimes, and technology stacks. This revenue-proximity gives you strong negotiation leverage.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Stripe | Scope |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Solutions Architect (L5) | Integration Engineer | Solutions Engineer | Solutions Architect | Individual deals |
| Senior SA (L6) | Senior Solutions | Senior SA | Senior SA | Enterprise accounts |
| Principal SA (L7) | Principal / Lead | Principal SA | Principal SA | Strategic partnerships |

Solutions Architect compensation at payments companies typically includes a variable/bonus component tied to deal outcomes. Candidates should clarify whether Nium's SA compensation includes performance bonuses, deal-based incentives, or is purely base + equity. If variable compensation is included, negotiate the guaranteed minimum and the realistic OTE (on-target earnings). Compare against Stripe (premium SA compensation), Adyen, and Checkout.com.

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion — a **"step change"** signaling the company's evolution from high-growth fintech to enterprise-grade payments infrastructure platform. The **Reimagined Infrastructure** mandate has direct revenue implications that Solutions Architects are uniquely positioned to capitalize on.

For a Solutions Architect, this step change creates specific leverage:

1. **Enterprise deal complexity**: The Reimagined Infrastructure initiative is enabling Nium to pursue larger, more complex enterprise deals — multi-corridor payment processing, treasury management integrations, and embedded finance partnerships. Solutions Architects who can navigate this complexity are essential to revenue growth.

2. **Scale-Architect client advisory**: Nium's **Scale-Architect** vision — bridging AI and programmable money — extends to how clients integrate with the platform. Solutions Architects who can advise enterprise clients on how to leverage AI-powered payment orchestration, programmable settlement, and intelligent routing are serving as external Scale-Architects and command premium compensation.

3. **Revenue attribution**: Solutions Architects directly influence deal size, time-to-close, and client retention. The C-Suite expansion signals a push for enterprise revenue growth, and SAs who can quantify their revenue impact have strong negotiation standing.

4. **Technical pre-sales authority**: With the Reimagined Infrastructure creating new product capabilities, Solutions Architects become the technical storytellers who translate infrastructure potential into client value propositions. This consultative authority is worth negotiating for explicitly.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Revenue-Proximity Premium**
> "Solutions Architects at Nium are directly revenue-generating — I design the integrations that close enterprise deals and determine transaction volume. In my previous role, I supported deals worth $X million in annual transaction value. I'd like the compensation to reflect this direct revenue linkage, including a base at the top of band and a meaningful equity grant tied to Nium's growth trajectory."

**Lever 2: Cross-Border Payments Domain Expertise**
> "Designing payment integrations across 100+ countries requires deep knowledge of settlement networks, regulatory requirements, FX handling, and compliance constraints. Most Solutions Architects come from SaaS backgrounds and lack this payments infrastructure depth. My domain expertise reduces integration risk and accelerates time-to-revenue for enterprise clients."

**Lever 3: Enterprise-Scale Integration Architecture**
> "Your Reimagined Infrastructure mandate means larger, more complex enterprise integrations. I specialize in designing architectures for high-volume payment processing — handling millions of transactions, multi-currency settlement, real-time reconciliation, and regulatory reporting. This enterprise-scale SA capability is worth a 15-20% premium over standard SA compensation."

**Lever 4: Competing SA Opportunities**
> "I'm evaluating Solutions Architect roles at [Stripe/Adyen/Checkout.com/competing platform] with total compensation packages of $X. Nium's step-change moment and the opportunity to shape how enterprise clients integrate with Reimagined Infrastructure are very appealing, but I need the package to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$250,000 base + $195,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$445,000. Accept no lower than **$195,000 base + $115,000 options** ($310,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$205,000 base + S$165,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$150,000 base + S$90,000 options**. In London, start at **£130,000 base + £95,000 options** and accept no lower than **£92,000 base + £55,000 options**. Solutions Architects should also negotiate for deal-based bonuses or variable compensation tied to enterprise revenue outcomes — this aligns your incentives with Nium's growth and can significantly increase total compensation.
