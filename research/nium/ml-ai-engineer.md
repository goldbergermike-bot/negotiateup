### ML/AI Engineer — Nium Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Nium's Step Change infrastructure mandate, translating the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion into a machine learning and AI engineering compensation framework spanning Singapore, San Francisco, and London markets. As an ML/AI Engineer at Nium, you are building the intelligence layer of global payments — creating the models that detect fraud in real-time, optimize payment routing across corridors, predict settlement times, automate compliance decisions, and power the next generation of programmable money.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$130,000 - S$210,000 | S$80,000 - S$180,000 | S$210,000 - S$390,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $190,000 - $280,000 | $120,000 - $260,000 | $310,000 - $540,000 |
| London (GBP) | £85,000 - £140,000 | £50,000 - £110,000 | £135,000 - £250,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers are the most contested talent category in the technology market today, and fintech payments adds a domain-complexity multiplier on top of already-fierce competition. Nium's Reimagined Infrastructure mandate following the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion explicitly positions AI-driven payment orchestration as a core differentiator. This means ML/AI Engineers are not a supporting function — they are building the primary competitive moat. Candidates negotiate from an extreme position of strength because Nium competes for ML/AI talent against Big Tech (Google, Meta, OpenAI), quantitative finance firms (Citadel, Two Sigma), and well-funded AI startups, all of which can offer substantial compensation packages.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Google |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| ML Engineer (L4) | Data Scientist | ML Engineer | ML Engineer | L4 SWE/ML |
| Senior ML (L5) | Senior DS / ML | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Eng | L5 Senior SWE/ML |
| Staff ML (L6) | Lead ML | Principal ML | Staff ML Eng | L6 Staff ML |

ML/AI compensation at Nium should be benchmarked against the top end of the market. In San Francisco, ML Engineers command 15-30% premiums over equivalent-level Software Engineers due to talent scarcity. Nium's pre-IPO option grants can close the gap with Big Tech RSU packages, but candidates should insist on enhanced equity grants to compensate for illiquidity risk. Compare against Stripe (strong ML team), OpenAI/Anthropic (AI-first companies), and Jane Street/Citadel (quantitative finance).

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion — a **"step change"** signaling the company's transformation from high-growth fintech to enterprise-grade payments infrastructure platform. The **Reimagined Infrastructure** mandate places AI and machine learning at the absolute center of Nium's competitive strategy.

For an ML/AI Engineer, this step change creates exceptional leverage:

1. **AI-powered payment orchestration**: The Reimagined Infrastructure vision includes intelligent payment routing that uses ML models to select optimal corridors, predict settlement times, minimize FX costs, and adapt to real-time market conditions. ML/AI Engineers are building the decision engine that makes programmable money intelligent.

2. **Scale-Architect embodiment**: Nium's **Scale-Architect** vision — bridging AI and programmable money — is the literal job description of an ML/AI Engineer at Nium. You are the person who makes money programmable by embedding intelligence into payment flows. This perfect alignment with the company's strategic vision means you can negotiate from a position of strategic importance, not just technical contribution.

3. **Fraud and risk intelligence**: ML models that detect fraud, assess transaction risk, and identify suspicious patterns directly protect Nium's revenue and regulatory standing. These models operate at the intersection of ML sophistication and financial domain knowledge — a combination that is exceptionally scarce.

4. **Proprietary data advantage**: Nium's cross-border transaction dataset across 100+ countries provides unique training data that no competitor can easily replicate. ML/AI Engineers who can leverage this proprietary data to build defensible competitive advantages are building Nium's long-term moat.

5. **LLM and GenAI applications**: The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate opens doors for LLM applications in compliance automation, document processing, customer support, and transaction classification. ML/AI Engineers with GenAI expertise are at the frontier of what is possible in payments.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: ML/AI Talent Market Scarcity**
> "The ML/AI talent market is the most competitive in technology right now. I have active interest from [Big Tech / AI startup / quant firm] with total compensation packages exceeding $X. I'm genuinely excited about Nium's vision of AI-powered payment orchestration, but I need the package to reflect the market reality for ML/AI talent — which means a significant premium over standard SWE compensation."

**Lever 2: Payments-Domain ML Specialization**
> "ML Engineers who understand financial data — transaction patterns, FX dynamics, fraud vectors, and regulatory constraints — are a subset of an already scarce talent pool. My experience building ML models for financial systems means I can deliver production models for Nium's Reimagined Infrastructure from day one, without a 6-month ramp on domain fundamentals. This specialization premium should be reflected in the compensation."

**Lever 3: Strategic AI Vision for Programmable Money**
> "Nium's Feb 12 step change explicitly positions AI as a core differentiator for the Reimagined Infrastructure. As an ML/AI Engineer, I'm not a supporting function — I'm building the primary competitive moat. I'd like the compensation to reflect this strategic importance, including a meaningful equity grant that aligns my long-term incentives with the company's AI-driven vision."

**Lever 4: Production ML System Complexity**
> "Building production ML systems for payments — sub-second inference latency, real-time feature computation, model monitoring in a regulated environment, and continuous retraining pipelines — is orders of magnitude harder than research or prototype ML. My experience deploying production ML at scale is directly relevant to Nium's Reimagined Infrastructure, and I'd like Staff-level compensation to reflect this production ML premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$275,000 base + $255,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$530,000. Accept no lower than **$205,000 base + $140,000 options** ($345,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$205,000 base + S$175,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$140,000 base + S$90,000 options**. In London, start at **£135,000 base + £105,000 options** and accept no lower than **£92,000 base + S£58,000 options**. ML/AI Engineers have the strongest negotiation position of any role at Nium — lead with competing offers and frame the equity ask around the strategic importance of AI to Nium's Reimagined Infrastructure vision.
