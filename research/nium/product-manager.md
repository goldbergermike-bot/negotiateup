#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$130,000 - S$200,000 | S$80,000 - S$170,000 | S$210,000 - S$370,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $170,000 - $245,000 | $100,000 - $220,000 | $270,000 - $465,000 |
| London (GBP) | £80,000 - £130,000 | £50,000 - £110,000 | £130,000 - £240,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Managers at Nium sit at the intersection of technology, regulation, and market strategy. The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate means PM decisions carry outsized impact — every API design choice, pricing model, and partner integration you define becomes embedded in the financial infrastructure of hundreds of enterprises. Following the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion, new product leadership needs PMs who understand both B2B payments infrastructure and the emerging opportunities around programmable money and AI-driven financial services. This combination of domain depth and strategic vision is rare, creating strong negotiation leverage for candidates with relevant experience.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Stripe | Scope |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| PM (L5) | Product Manager | Product Manager | PM | Single product area |
| Senior PM (L6) | Senior PM | Senior PM | Senior PM | Multi-product portfolio |
| Group PM (L7) | Group PM / Lead | Head of Product | GPM | Product line strategy |

Nium PM compensation leans closer to infrastructure/platform PM bands than consumer PM bands. Candidates should benchmark against Stripe, Plaid, and Adyen PM compensation rather than consumer fintech companies like Revolut or Monzo. Platform PM roles command a 10-15% premium over consumer PM roles due to the technical depth required to manage API products and developer experiences.

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion that signaled a **"step change"** in the company's ambition — moving from high-growth fintech to enterprise-grade payments infrastructure platform. New leaders were brought in from major payments incumbents and technology companies, with an explicit mandate to **reimagine infrastructure** from the ground up.

For a Product Manager, this step change creates distinct negotiation advantages:

1. **Product definition authority**: The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate means entire product categories are being conceived from scratch — new API products, embedded finance modules, programmable money capabilities, and AI-powered payment orchestration. PMs hired now will shape product strategy at a foundational level.

2. **Scale-Architect partnership**: Nium is building **Scale-Architect** teams that bridge AI and programmable money. PMs who can translate this technical vision into market-facing products — understanding both the engineering possibilities and the enterprise buyer needs — are essential. Position yourself as a PM who speaks both languages.

3. **Revenue impact framing**: Infrastructure PMs directly influence revenue through pricing models, API packaging, and partner economics. The C-Suite expansion signals Nium's focus on enterprise revenue growth, and PMs who can quantify their impact on revenue and gross margin will command premium compensation.

4. **Strategic roadmap influence**: With new product leadership still forming their strategic view, PMs hired during this window have unusual influence over the multi-year roadmap. This is a non-monetary lever worth negotiating for — formal ownership of strategic product areas and direct access to Chief Product Officer.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Platform Product Complexity Premium**
> "Building products for a payments infrastructure platform is fundamentally different from consumer product management. I need to manage API design, developer experience, regulatory compliance across 100+ countries, and enterprise integration requirements simultaneously. I'm looking for compensation that reflects this platform PM premium — which I benchmark at 15-20% above standard B2B PM packages."

**Lever 2: Revenue-Linked Product Strategy**
> "My product decisions directly drive Nium's revenue — through API pricing, payment corridor economics, and enterprise upsell pathways. In my previous role, I shipped products that generated $X million in incremental annual revenue. I'd like to discuss a compensation structure that reflects this direct revenue impact, potentially including performance-based equity acceleration."

**Lever 3: Payments Domain Expertise**
> "PMs who understand cross-border payments at infrastructure depth — settlement flows, correspondent banking, FX risk, and regulatory orchestration — are exceptionally rare. My [X years] of payments domain experience means I can drive the Reimagined Infrastructure roadmap from day one. I'd like the base and equity to reflect this domain scarcity."

**Lever 4: Competing Product Roles**
> "I'm currently evaluating PM roles at [Stripe/Plaid/Adyen/competing platform], where total compensation is in the $X range. I'm drawn to Nium's step-change moment and the opportunity to define products at the Reimagined Infrastructure level, but I need the package to be within competitive range."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$240,000 base + $210,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$450,000. Accept no lower than **$185,000 base + $120,000 options** ($305,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$195,000 base + S$160,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$140,000 base + S$90,000 options**. In London, start at **£125,000 base + £105,000 options** and accept no lower than **£90,000 base + £60,000 options**. PMs should negotiate scope and title alongside compensation — owning a strategic product area (e.g., "PM, Payment Orchestration" or "PM, Embedded Finance") significantly increases long-term career and compensation trajectory.
