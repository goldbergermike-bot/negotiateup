#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$160,000 - S$240,000 | S$120,000 - S$250,000 | S$280,000 - S$490,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $210,000 - $290,000 | $150,000 - $300,000 | $360,000 - $590,000 |
| London (GBP) | £100,000 - £155,000 | £80,000 - £160,000 | £180,000 - £315,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering Managers at Nium are in a uniquely powerful negotiating position because the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion created an immediate need for management layers that can translate executive strategy into engineering execution. The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate is not just a technical challenge — it is an organizational design challenge. Nium needs EMs who can build high-performing teams across Singapore, San Francisco, and London, navigate the complexity of distributed payments engineering, and retain scarce talent in a fiercely competitive market. The combination of organizational growth, team-building urgency, and cross-border management complexity justifies a premium above standard fintech EM packages.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Stripe | Scope |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| EM I (L6) | Engineering Lead | Engineering Manager | EM (single team) | 5-8 engineers |
| EM II (L7) | Senior EM | Senior EM | Senior EM (multi-team) | 10-20 engineers |
| Director (L8) | Director of Eng | Director of Eng | Director | 20-40+ engineers |

Nium's EM levels are expanding as the organization scales. Candidates should clarify the reporting structure (reporting to VP Eng vs. Director vs. CTO), team size, and whether the role includes hiring authority and budget ownership. EMs reporting directly to newly hired C-Suite leaders have stronger negotiation positioning due to high visibility and the new leader's need for trusted lieutenants.

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion — a **"step change"** that brought in seasoned leaders from major payments companies, global banks, and enterprise technology platforms. This was a deliberate transformation signal: Nium is evolving from a startup-mode engineering organization into an enterprise-grade infrastructure company.

The **Reimagined Infrastructure** mandate has profound implications for engineering management:

1. **Team-building authority**: The Reimagined Infrastructure initiative requires entirely new teams — platform engineering, infrastructure reliability, compliance automation, AI/ML payments, and real-time settlement. EMs hired now will define team structures, hiring profiles, and engineering culture from scratch.

2. **Scale-Architect talent pipeline**: Nium is seeking **Scale-Architects** — engineers who bridge AI and programmable money. As an EM, your ability to identify, recruit, and develop Scale-Architect talent is your primary value proposition. Frame your negotiation around your track record of building teams that attract and retain this caliber of engineer.

3. **Organizational design influence**: With new C-Suite leaders still establishing their organizational models, EMs have an unusual window to influence how engineering teams are structured. This is a non-monetary benefit worth negotiating for explicitly — formal input into org design, direct access to VP/CTO, and participation in leadership forums.

4. **Retention budget leverage**: Nium knows that losing key engineers during the Reimagined Infrastructure build is catastrophic. EMs who can demonstrate strong retention track records can negotiate not only their own compensation but also larger team compensation budgets, which indirectly strengthens their position and influence.

5. **Pre-IPO equity at management scale**: EM-level option grants are typically 1.5-3x individual contributor grants at equivalent levels. Combined with the IPO preparation signals from the C-Suite expansion, the equity component of an EM package carries significant upside.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Team-Building Track Record Premium**
> "I understand Nium needs to build multiple new engineering teams to execute the Reimagined Infrastructure vision. My track record includes scaling engineering teams from X to Y people while maintaining [retention rate / velocity / quality metric]. Building payments-domain teams across multiple geographies is exceptionally difficult, and I'd like the compensation to reflect the team-building premium — specifically, a base salary at the top of your EM II band."

**Lever 2: Cross-Border Management Complexity**
> "Managing distributed engineering teams across Singapore, San Francisco, and London — with different labor markets, employment laws, and cultural norms — is fundamentally harder than managing a co-located team. I'm looking for a 15-20% premium above your standard EM offer to reflect this multi-geography management complexity."

**Lever 3: Competing EM Offers Calibration**
> "I'm evaluating Engineering Manager opportunities at [Stripe/Wise/Airwallex/Big Tech company] with total compensation packages in the range of $X-$Y. Nium's step-change moment is genuinely compelling to me, but I need the package to be competitive. I'm flexible on the base-equity split — I'm happy to weight toward options if the total comp target is met."

**Lever 4: Organizational Influence and Scope**
> "Beyond compensation, I'd like to discuss the organizational scope of this role. Specifically, I'm looking for direct hiring authority, budget ownership for my teams, participation in the engineering leadership council, and a clear path to Director-level scope within 18-24 months as the Reimagined Infrastructure initiative scales."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$280,000 base + $290,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$570,000. Accept no lower than **$225,000 base + $170,000 options** ($395,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$235,000 base + S$240,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$170,000 base + S$135,000 options**. In London, start at **£150,000 base + £155,000 options** and accept no lower than **£110,000 base + £90,000 options**. EMs should also negotiate scope explicitly — team size, hiring authority, and budget ownership are compensation-adjacent levers that compound in value over time.
