### Senior Software Engineer — Nium Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Nium's Step Change infrastructure mandate, translating the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion into a senior software engineering compensation framework spanning Singapore, San Francisco, and London markets. As a Senior Software Engineer at Nium, you are the technical backbone of the Reimagined Infrastructure initiative — owning system design, mentoring engineers, and making architectural decisions that determine how billions of dollars flow across borders.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$120,000 - S$180,000 | S$80,000 - S$160,000 | S$200,000 - S$340,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $180,000 - $240,000 | $100,000 - $200,000 | $280,000 - $440,000 |
| London (GBP) | £80,000 - £120,000 | £50,000 - £100,000 | £130,000 - £220,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Senior Software Engineers are the most contested talent band at Nium right now. The company's Reimagined Infrastructure mandate requires engineers who can independently own complex systems — not just write code, but design for global scale, regulatory compliance across 100+ jurisdictions, and sub-second settlement times. Following the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion, new engineering leadership needs to demonstrate rapid technical progress, and Senior SWEs are the force multipliers who make that happen. This demand-supply imbalance creates exceptional negotiation leverage. Competitors like Wise, Airwallex, Rapyd, and Stripe are all hiring aggressively in the same talent pool, giving you multiple credible alternatives to reference in negotiations.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Rapyd | Equivalent at Stripe |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Senior SWE (L5) | Senior Engineer | Senior Software Engineer | Senior Engineer | L3 Software Engineer |
| Senior SWE (L6) | Staff Engineer (entry) | Lead Engineer | Senior Engineer II | L3 Senior |

Nium's Senior SWE band is broad, spanning two internal levels. Candidates should clarify which sub-level they are being offered and negotiate accordingly. The L6 Senior at Nium maps closer to Staff at Wise and Lead at Airwallex — if you are being placed at L6, your compensation should reflect that seniority. Compared to Stripe's SF office, Nium's base salaries are 10-20% lower, but pre-IPO option upside can close the gap significantly. In Singapore, Nium pays competitively with Airwallex and above most local fintechs.

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion, recruiting senior leaders from major payments incumbents, global banks, and enterprise technology companies. This was described internally and externally as a **"step change"** — a deliberate signal that Nium is transitioning from a high-growth startup into a scalable enterprise-grade infrastructure platform.

The **Reimagined Infrastructure** mandate is the technical expression of this ambition: rebuilding payments infrastructure from the ground up, replacing legacy integrations with modern, API-first, event-driven architectures capable of supporting AI-driven transaction orchestration and programmable money flows.

For a Senior Software Engineer, this step change creates specific leverage:

1. **Ownership of critical systems**: The Reimagined Infrastructure initiative requires Senior SWEs to own entire subsystems — payment routing engines, compliance orchestration layers, treasury management modules, and real-time settlement pipelines. This is not maintenance work; it is greenfield architecture at scale.

2. **Scale-Architect positioning**: Nium explicitly seeks engineers who function as **Scale-Architects** — professionals who bridge AI and programmable money, thinking about systems that process millions of transactions while adapting to regulatory changes in real-time. Senior SWEs who demonstrate this mindset command premium compensation because they reduce the company's need for additional Staff or Principal hires.

3. **New leadership, fresh budgets**: The C-Suite expansion means new engineering leaders are building their teams and have strong incentive to make competitive offers. Budget flexibility is highest in the first 6-12 months after leadership transitions.

4. **IPO preparation tailwind**: The leadership expansion is widely interpreted as IPO groundwork. Options granted at the current valuation could see 3-5x appreciation in a successful public offering, making the equity component of your package potentially the most valuable lever.

Frame your negotiation around being a force multiplier for the Reimagined Infrastructure timeline — someone who accelerates the step change, not someone who needs to be brought up to speed.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Infrastructure Ownership Premium**
> "Your Reimagined Infrastructure initiative requires Senior Engineers who can own entire payment subsystems end-to-end. My experience designing and operating high-throughput financial systems maps directly to your needs. I'm looking for compensation that reflects system ownership, not just feature delivery — specifically, a base salary in the top quartile of your Senior SWE band."

**Lever 2: Competing Offer Calibration**
> "I'm currently evaluating offers from [Wise/Airwallex/Stripe/competing fintech], and I want to be transparent that their total compensation is positioned at $X. I'm genuinely excited about Nium's step-change moment, but I need the package to be competitive. Can we close the gap on base salary, or alternatively increase the options grant to reflect the pre-IPO opportunity?"

**Lever 3: Payments Domain Scarcity**
> "Engineers who understand cross-border payments — settlement cycles, FX risk, multi-jurisdictional compliance, and real-time gross settlement systems — are genuinely scarce. My domain expertise means I can contribute to your Reimagined Infrastructure mandate from day one without a 6-month ramp on payments fundamentals. I'd like the compensation to reflect this domain premium."

**Lever 4: Pre-IPO Equity Maximization**
> "Given the Feb 12 leadership expansion and what it signals about Nium's trajectory, I'd like to weight my package toward equity. I'm willing to accept a base at $X if we can increase the 4-year options grant to $Y — I want my incentives aligned with the company's long-term infrastructure ambitions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$235,000 base + $200,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$435,000. Accept no lower than **$190,000 base + $120,000 options** ($310,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$175,000 base + S$150,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$130,000 base + S$90,000 options**. In London, start at **£115,000 base + £95,000 options** and accept no lower than **£85,000 base + £55,000 options**. Lead with equity negotiations — Nium's pre-IPO status gives hiring managers more flexibility on options than on base salary, and the upside potential is your strongest economic argument.
