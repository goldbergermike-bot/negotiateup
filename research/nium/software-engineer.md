### Software Engineer — Nium Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Nium's Step Change infrastructure mandate, translating the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion into a software engineering compensation framework spanning Singapore, San Francisco, and London markets. As a Software Engineer at Nium, you are not simply writing code — you are constructing the programmable money rails that underpin billions of dollars in cross-border transactions.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$80,000 - S$120,000 | S$40,000 - S$80,000 | S$120,000 - S$200,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $130,000 - $175,000 | $60,000 - $120,000 | $190,000 - $295,000 |
| London (GBP) | £55,000 - £80,000 | £30,000 - £60,000 | £85,000 - £140,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Software Engineers at Nium sit at the foundation of the Reimagined Infrastructure initiative. Every API endpoint you build, every microservice you deploy, and every integration you harden becomes part of the invisible backbone connecting global payments across 100+ countries. The Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion signals that Nium is scaling from a high-growth fintech into an enterprise-grade infrastructure platform — and the engineering talent brought on now will define the architecture for years to come. This transformation creates premium negotiation leverage because Nium must compete with both Big Tech and well-funded fintech rivals for engineers who understand real-time payments, compliance-aware systems, and multi-currency processing.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Rapyd |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| SWE I (L3) | Engineer I | Software Engineer | Junior Engineer |
| SWE II (L4) | Engineer II | Software Engineer II | Engineer |
| SWE III (L5) | Senior Engineer (entry) | Mid-Senior Engineer | Mid-Level Engineer |

Nium's internal leveling is evolving as the company scales. Candidates should benchmark against Wise (public, London-listed), Airwallex (private, valued ~$5.6B), and Rapyd (private, valued ~$8.75B). Nium's pre-IPO options carry significant upside potential compared to public-company RSUs at Wise, but candidates should discount option value by 30-50% for illiquidity risk. Compared to Airwallex and Rapyd, Nium offers competitive base salaries in Singapore with stronger global mobility due to its 190+ country licensing footprint.

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion — bringing in seasoned leaders from major payments incumbents and enterprise technology companies. This was not a routine hiring cycle; it signaled a **"step change"** in ambition. The company explicitly framed its mandate as **Reimagined Infrastructure**: rebuilding payments infrastructure from the ground up to support the next decade of programmable money, embedded finance, and AI-driven transaction orchestration.

For a Software Engineer, this step change means:

1. **Greenfield architecture opportunities**: The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate means entire systems are being redesigned. Engineers hired now will shape foundational decisions — language choices, database architectures, API contracts, and event-driven patterns — rather than inheriting legacy code.

2. **Scale-Architect trajectory**: Nium is looking for engineers who think beyond feature delivery and position themselves as **Scale-Architects** — professionals who bridge AI and programmable money. Even at the SWE level, demonstrating systems thinking about throughput, latency, and compliance-aware routing gives you premium negotiation positioning.

3. **C-Suite visibility**: With new leadership actively building their teams, Software Engineers have an unusual window of direct influence on technical direction. The new CTO and VP Engineering hires need to show rapid progress, making talent acquisition a top priority with flexible budget authority.

4. **Pre-IPO equity timing**: The leadership expansion is widely viewed as IPO preparation. Options granted during this phase could see substantial appreciation if Nium follows the Adyen or dLocal trajectory to public markets.

Use this lever in negotiations by framing yourself as someone who will accelerate the Reimagined Infrastructure timeline — not just fill a headcount slot.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Programmable Money Builder Premium**
> "I understand Nium is rebuilding its payments infrastructure from the ground up following the Feb 12 leadership expansion. My experience with real-time payment systems and API-first architecture directly maps to your Reimagined Infrastructure mandate. I'd like the compensation to reflect the complexity of building programmable money rails at global scale — not just a standard SWE package."

**Lever 2: Cross-Border Complexity Multiplier**
> "Building software that processes payments across 100+ countries with different regulatory regimes, currency formats, and settlement windows is fundamentally harder than typical SaaS engineering. I'm looking for a base salary that reflects this payments-infrastructure complexity premium, which I've benchmarked at 15-20% above standard fintech SWE offers."

**Lever 3: Pre-IPO Equity Acceleration**
> "Given Nium's C-Suite expansion and clear trajectory toward enterprise scale, I'd like to discuss an enhanced options package. I'm willing to accept a modest base adjustment if the 4-year options grant reflects the upside of joining during this step-change phase — specifically, I'm looking for an additional 20-30% in option value above the standard band."

**Lever 4: Multi-Market Mobility Value**
> "Nium's presence in Singapore, San Francisco, and London is a significant draw for me. I'd like to discuss how internal transfer flexibility and cost-of-living adjustments are handled, and whether we can formalize a mobility clause that recognizes my willingness to support global engineering needs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$170,000 base + $120,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$290,000. Accept no lower than **$145,000 base + $80,000 options** ($225,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$115,000 base + S$75,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$90,000 base + S$50,000 options**. In London, start at **£78,000 base + £55,000 options** and accept no lower than **£60,000 base + £35,000 options**. Always negotiate options first — Nium has more flexibility on equity than cash during this growth phase.
