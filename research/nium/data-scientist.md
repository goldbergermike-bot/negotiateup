### Data Scientist — Nium Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Nium's Step Change infrastructure mandate, translating the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion into a data science compensation framework spanning Singapore, San Francisco, and London markets. As a Data Scientist at Nium, you extract signal from the firehose of cross-border transaction data — building fraud detection models, payment routing optimization engines, pricing algorithms, and the analytical foundations that transform raw transaction flows into strategic intelligence.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$110,000 - S$175,000 | S$60,000 - S$130,000 | S$170,000 - S$305,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $160,000 - $230,000 | $80,000 - $180,000 | $240,000 - $410,000 |
| London (GBP) | £70,000 - £115,000 | £40,000 - £80,000 | £110,000 - £195,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Scientists at Nium work with transaction datasets that most companies can only dream of — billions of dollars in cross-border payment flows across 100+ countries, revealing patterns in global commerce, FX movements, and fraud vectors. The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate following the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion explicitly includes AI-driven payment orchestration, which positions Data Scientists as central to the company's next-generation capabilities. Candidates who can combine statistical rigor with payments domain knowledge have strong negotiation leverage because Nium competes for this talent against both Big Tech ML teams and quantitative finance firms.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Stripe | Scope |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Data Scientist (L4) | Analyst / Junior DS | Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Model development |
| Senior DS (L5) | Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist | Senior DS | End-to-end ML pipelines |
| Staff DS (L6) | Senior DS / Lead | Lead Data Scientist | Staff DS | Strategic modeling |

Nium's data science team is growing rapidly as the company builds out AI-powered capabilities. Candidates should benchmark against Stripe (strong DS practice), Wise (public comp data available), and quantitative trading firms (for those with optimization/pricing model expertise). Fintech DS roles command a 10-15% premium over general tech DS roles due to the regulatory complexity and financial modeling requirements.

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion — a **"step change"** in the company's trajectory from high-growth fintech to enterprise-grade payments infrastructure platform. The **Reimagined Infrastructure** mandate explicitly encompasses AI and data-driven capabilities as core differentiators.

For a Data Scientist, this step change creates powerful negotiation leverage:

1. **AI-driven payment orchestration**: The Reimagined Infrastructure vision includes intelligent payment routing — using ML models to select optimal corridors, predict settlement times, minimize FX costs, and detect fraud in real-time. Data Scientists are the builders of this intelligence layer.

2. **Scale-Architect data foundations**: Nium's **Scale-Architect** vision — bridging AI and programmable money — requires Data Scientists who think beyond model accuracy to system-level impact. Models must operate at massive scale, with sub-second latency, across diverse regulatory regimes. Candidates who demonstrate this systems-level thinking command premium compensation.

3. **Proprietary data moat**: Nium's transaction data across 100+ countries is a proprietary asset that no competitor can easily replicate. Data Scientists who can extract strategic value from this dataset — building competitive advantages in pricing, risk, and routing — are extraordinarily valuable to the business.

4. **Revenue-linked models**: Many DS outputs at Nium directly impact revenue — FX pricing models, corridor optimization, and fraud loss reduction. This direct revenue linkage strengthens your negotiation position because your impact is measurable in dollars.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Payments Data Specialization**
> "Working with cross-border payment data requires specialized knowledge of FX dynamics, settlement networks, regulatory constraints, and fraud patterns that general data scientists don't possess. I bring [X years] of experience building models on financial transaction data, and I'd like the compensation to reflect this domain premium — specifically, a 15-20% uplift above your standard DS band."

**Lever 2: Revenue-Impact Modeling**
> "My models directly affect Nium's revenue and risk profile — payment routing optimization, FX pricing, and fraud detection all have quantifiable P&L impact. In my previous role, my models generated $X million in annual savings / revenue uplift. I'd like to discuss a compensation structure that reflects this direct financial impact."

**Lever 3: AI Infrastructure for Programmable Money**
> "Nium's Reimagined Infrastructure mandate includes AI-driven payment orchestration — and I'm the person who builds that intelligence layer. This is not standard analytics; it is production ML that processes millions of transactions in real-time. I'm looking for Staff-level DS compensation that reflects the production ML complexity and the strategic importance of this work to Nium's step-change vision."

**Lever 4: Competing Quantitative Offers**
> "I'm evaluating data science roles at [Stripe/quant firm/Big Tech company] with total compensation in the $X range. Nium's unique transaction dataset and the opportunity to build AI-powered payment orchestration from scratch are compelling, but I need the package to be competitive with my quantitative alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$225,000 base + $175,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$400,000. Accept no lower than **$175,000 base + $95,000 options** ($270,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$170,000 base + S$125,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$120,000 base + S$70,000 options**. In London, start at **£110,000 base + £75,000 options** and accept no lower than **£78,000 base + £45,000 options**. Data Scientists should emphasize the revenue impact of their models — Nium can more easily justify premium comp for DS roles that directly affect the P&L.
