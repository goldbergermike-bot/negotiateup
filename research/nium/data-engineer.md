### Data Engineer — Nium Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Nium's Step Change infrastructure mandate, translating the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion into a data engineering compensation framework spanning Singapore, San Francisco, and London markets. As a Data Engineer at Nium, you build the data infrastructure that powers everything from real-time fraud detection to payment routing optimization — constructing the pipelines, warehouses, and streaming systems that transform raw transaction data into the intelligence layer of programmable money.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Singapore (SGD) | S$105,000 - S$170,000 | S$55,000 - S$120,000 | S$160,000 - S$290,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $160,000 - $225,000 | $75,000 - $170,000 | $235,000 - $395,000 |
| London (GBP) | £70,000 - £115,000 | £40,000 - £80,000 | £110,000 - £195,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Engineers at Nium occupy a critical position in the technology stack. Cross-border payments generate enormous volumes of structured and semi-structured data — transaction records, compliance events, FX rate feeds, settlement confirmations, and regulatory reports across 100+ jurisdictions. The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate following the Feb 12, 2026 C-Suite expansion requires a modern data platform that can handle real-time streaming, batch analytics, ML feature stores, and regulatory reporting simultaneously. Data Engineers who can architect and build these systems at scale are in high demand across fintech and Big Tech, giving candidates strong negotiation leverage.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Nium Level | Equivalent at Wise | Equivalent at Airwallex | Equivalent at Stripe | Scope |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Data Engineer (L4) | Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Pipeline development |
| Senior DE (L5) | Senior Data Engineer | Senior DE | Senior DE | Platform ownership |
| Staff DE (L6) | Lead Data Engineer | Principal DE | Staff DE | Architecture + strategy |

Data Engineer compensation has converged with Software Engineer compensation at most top-tier companies. Candidates should ensure Nium's DE compensation is at parity with SWE compensation at equivalent levels — any discount is a negotiation opportunity. Compare against Stripe, Databricks, and Snowflake for premium DE benchmarks, and Wise and Airwallex for direct fintech comparisons.

#### Nium Step Change & Reimagined Infrastructure Lever

On **Feb 12, 2026**, Nium announced a sweeping C-Suite expansion — a **"step change"** signaling the company's transformation from high-growth fintech to enterprise-grade payments infrastructure platform. The **Reimagined Infrastructure** mandate places data engineering at the center of the transformation.

For a Data Engineer, this step change creates specific leverage:

1. **Data platform architecture from scratch**: The Reimagined Infrastructure mandate includes building a modern data platform that supports real-time analytics, ML model serving, regulatory reporting, and business intelligence. Data Engineers hired now will make foundational decisions about data warehousing, stream processing, data governance, and schema design.

2. **Scale-Architect data thinking**: Nium's **Scale-Architect** vision — bridging AI and programmable money — is fundamentally a data challenge. AI-driven payment orchestration requires feature stores, real-time event streams, and ML pipelines that Data Engineers build. Candidates who position themselves as the data infrastructure builders enabling the Scale-Architect vision command premium compensation.

3. **Regulatory data complexity**: Payments data is subject to stringent regulatory requirements — data residency laws, PCI DSS data handling, GDPR compliance, and multi-jurisdictional reporting obligations. Data Engineers who can design compliant-by-default data architectures are exceptionally valuable and rare.

4. **Transaction data moat**: Nium's cross-border transaction dataset is a proprietary competitive advantage. Data Engineers who can make this data accessible, reliable, and actionable — while maintaining compliance — are building the foundation for Nium's AI and analytics capabilities.

5. **Real-time processing requirements**: Payments infrastructure demands real-time data processing — fraud detection, transaction monitoring, and settlement reconciliation cannot wait for batch jobs. Data Engineers with streaming expertise (Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming) are in premium demand.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Financial Data Platform Complexity**
> "Building data infrastructure for cross-border payments is fundamentally more complex than standard SaaS data engineering. I need to handle real-time streaming, multi-currency data models, regulatory data residency requirements, PCI DSS compliance, and reporting obligations across 100+ jurisdictions. I'm looking for compensation that reflects this financial data platform premium — specifically 15-20% above standard data engineering packages."

**Lever 2: Real-Time Streaming Expertise**
> "Nium's Reimagined Infrastructure requires real-time data pipelines for fraud detection, transaction monitoring, and payment routing optimization. My experience building production streaming systems with [Kafka/Flink/Spark Streaming] that process [X million events per day / Y TB per day] directly maps to your scale requirements. This real-time specialization commands a premium over batch-oriented data engineering."

**Lever 3: DE-SWE Parity**
> "Data Engineering is core infrastructure at Nium — the data platform is as critical as the payment processing platform. I'd like to ensure the compensation package is at parity with Software Engineering at equivalent levels, which I understand is [industry standard] practice at companies like Stripe and Google."

**Lever 4: Competing Data Engineering Offers**
> "I'm evaluating data engineering roles at [Databricks/Snowflake/Stripe/competing company] with total compensation of $X. Nium's step-change moment and the opportunity to build the data platform for Reimagined Infrastructure from the ground up are exciting, but I need the package to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: In San Francisco, start your ask at **$220,000 base + $165,000 in options (4yr vest)** for a total comp target of ~$385,000. Accept no lower than **$175,000 base + $90,000 options** ($265,000 total comp floor). In Singapore, start at **S$165,000 base + S$115,000 options** and accept no lower than **S$115,000 base + S$65,000 options**. In London, start at **£110,000 base + £75,000 options** and accept no lower than **£78,000 base + £45,000 options**. Data Engineers should anchor on SWE parity — if Nium's Senior SWE base is $X, Senior DE base should match. Any gap is an immediate negotiation target.
