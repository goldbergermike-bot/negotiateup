**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Alibaba manage infrastructure supporting both the company's internal platforms and Alibaba Cloud's external customers. The infrastructure must handle extreme spikes: Singles' Day generates 500K+ transactions per second, requiring auto-scaling that can provision thousands of servers in minutes. Alibaba's proprietary distributed operating system (Apsara) manages millions of servers across global data centers, and DevOps engineers are responsible for the reliability, deployment, and monitoring of this hyperscale environment.

US-based DevOps engineers focus on Alibaba Cloud's international infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline development, Kubernetes orchestration, and observability platform engineering. Compensation is competitive with FAANG SRE/infrastructure roles.

**Level Mapping:** DevOps Engineer at Alibaba (P5-P7) = L3-L5 SRE at Google, IC3-IC5 PE at Meta, SysDE at Amazon

**The Singles' Day Reliability Premium**

Alibaba's infrastructure must maintain 99.999% uptime during Singles' Day -- the world's largest e-commerce event. DevOps engineers who have survived and optimized for these extreme spikes develop resilience engineering skills that are unmatched in the industry.
