**Negotiation DNA**

Alibaba's AI efforts span DAMO Academy (the company's research arm, producing publications at NeurIPS, ICML, and CVPR), the Tongyi Qianwen large language model family (competing with Baidu's ERNIE and Tencent's HunYuan), and production AI systems powering search, recommendations, advertising, and logistics across the e-commerce ecosystem. ML/AI Engineers at Alibaba work on some of the world's largest-scale AI deployment challenges.

US-based AI engineers typically work on AI infrastructure for Alibaba Cloud (PAI platform), international AI research, or foundational model development. Compensation is competitive with FAANG AI roles, and Alibaba is authorized to match offers from frontier AI labs for senior AI talent. DAMO Academy researchers publish extensively and have contributed significant open-source AI frameworks.

**Level Mapping:** ML/AI Engineer at Alibaba (P6-P8) = L4-L5 at Google Brain, IC4-IC5 at Meta FAIR, Research Engineer at OpenAI/Anthropic

**The Commerce AI Premium**

Alibaba's AI directly drives revenue: recommendation models influence billions in daily GMV, search ranking AI determines product visibility for millions of merchants, and logistics AI optimizes delivery routes across China's vast geography. Few companies can offer AI engineers the opportunity to see their models impact this magnitude of economic activity.
