**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Alibaba coordinate programs spanning the company's diverse business groups. Singles' Day preparation alone involves coordinating infrastructure scaling, merchant readiness, logistics optimization, and platform stability across 100,000+ engineers. US-based TPMs manage cloud platform launches, international product rollouts, and cross-border technology initiatives.

Following Alibaba's restructuring, TPMs operate within more focused business groups but still coordinate cross-group programs. US TPMs bring FAANG program management discipline to Alibaba's execution-focused culture.

**Level Mapping:** TPM at Alibaba (P7-P8) = L5-L6 TPM at Google, IC5-IC6 TPM at Meta, Sr TPM at Amazon

**The Cross-Division Coordination Premium**

Alibaba's restructured business groups still share infrastructure and require coordination for major events (Singles' Day, cloud launches). TPMs who can drive alignment across these groups while managing US-China time zone and cultural differences are highly valued.

**Global Levers**
