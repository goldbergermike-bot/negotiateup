**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Alibaba drive the company's cloud expansion, particularly in international markets. Alibaba Cloud is Asia-Pacific's leading cloud provider and is aggressively expanding into Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. SAs design cloud architectures for enterprise customers, e-commerce companies adopting Alibaba's platform, and companies leveraging Alibaba's unique data and AI services.

US-based SAs focus on international cloud customer engagements, partner ecosystem development, and enterprise architecture for cross-border commerce solutions. Compensation includes base, RSUs, and in some cases deal-influenced bonuses.
