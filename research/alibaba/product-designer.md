**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Alibaba shape experiences for the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Taobao and Tmall together serve over 1 billion annual active consumers, and design decisions directly impact conversion rates, average order values, and merchant satisfaction. US-based designers focus on international product experiences (Lazada, AliExpress international), Alibaba Cloud console design, and cross-cultural UX adaptation.

Alibaba's design organization values designers who can bridge Chinese and Western design sensibilities, and US designers play a key role in adapting proven Chinese e-commerce patterns for international markets. Compensation is competitive with mid-tier tech design roles.
