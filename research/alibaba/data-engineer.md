**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Alibaba build the pipelines that process transaction, logistics, and user behavior data from the world's largest e-commerce ecosystem. Alibaba's proprietary data platform (MaxCompute, the company's Hadoop-scale data warehousing system) processes exabytes of data, and its contributions to Apache Flink (originally Alibaba's Blink fork) power real-time streaming analytics. Singles' Day generates data spikes that dwarf any other e-commerce event globally.

US-based data engineers work on Alibaba Cloud's managed data services (MaxCompute, DataWorks, Realtime Compute for Flink), international data platform development, and AI training data pipelines. Compensation is competitive with FAANG data engineering roles, with strong RSU grants.

**Level Mapping:** Data Engineer at Alibaba (P5-P7) = L3-L5 at Google, IC3-IC5 at Meta, DE II-Senior at Amazon, equivalent Snowflake/Databricks

**The Real-Time Commerce Data Premium**

Alibaba's real-time data processing capabilities (built on Flink/Blink) are industry-leading. Data engineers who can build pipelines handling 500K+ TPS during Singles' Day develop expertise that is highly transferable. The company's investment in Apache Flink makes Alibaba data engineers particularly attractive to streaming-focused companies.

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Platform Offer:** "I have an offer from [Snowflake/Databricks/Amazon] at $[X] TC. Alibaba's real-time data scale is unmatched."
2. **Flink/Streaming Expertise:** "My [Apache Flink/real-time streaming/event-driven] experience maps directly to Alibaba's data platform strengths."
3. **Cloud Data Services Impact:** "My work on managed data services directly drives Alibaba Cloud revenue growth."
