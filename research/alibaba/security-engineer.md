**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Alibaba protect one of the world's most high-value digital ecosystems. The company processes over $1 trillion in annual GMV, manages sensitive data for 1B+ consumers, and integrates closely with Ant Group's financial services. Alibaba Cloud offers security products (WAF, DDoS protection, threat intelligence) as a revenue-generating product line. This combination makes security engineering both a critical defensive function and a revenue driver.

US-based security engineers focus on cloud security product development, application security for international platforms, and security research. Compensation reflects the global security talent shortage.
