### AI Trip Planning Engineer | Airbnb Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15–25% AI PREMIUM** | Live Anywhere Policy | Experiences Marketplace Expansion

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco / Remote | $242K–$305K | $325K–$568K | None | $323K–$447K |
| New York | $242K–$305K | $325K–$568K | None | $323K–$447K |
| London | £166K–£210K | £223K–£390K | None | £222K–£307K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Airbnb's signature role for 2026 — the AI Trip Planning Engineer. You're building the LLM-powered trip planning system, personalized itinerary generation engine, and AI concierge that transforms how hundreds of millions of travelers plan and book travel. This role sits at the intersection of Airbnb's two biggest strategic bets: AI and Experiences. The AI trip planning product uses large language models to create personalized itineraries that combine accommodations, Experiences (curated activities, restaurant reservations), and local recommendations into a seamless travel plan. This is one of the highest-profile consumer-facing LLM applications in the world — serving 150M+ potential users across 220+ countries. The 15-25% AI premium applies, and comp is at the top of Airbnb's engineering bands. Engineers on this team are the #1 hiring priority. [Source: Airbnb AI Trip Planning Team 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Airbnb AI Trip Planning Eng (Senior) = Google L4-L5 ML = Anthropic Senior Eng = OpenAI Senior Eng

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The AI Trip Planning Engineer builds systems that are fundamentally different from standard ML engineering at Airbnb:
- **LLM-Powered Itinerary Generation:** Designing and fine-tuning LLMs that synthesize accommodation data, Experience availability, local knowledge, user preferences, and real-time pricing into coherent, personalized trip plans
- **AI Concierge Experience:** Building a conversational AI that acts as a personal travel advisor — answering questions, adjusting itineraries, handling booking modifications, and proactively suggesting Experiences
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Integrating Airbnb's massive corpus of listings, reviews, host data, and Experiences catalog into LLM retrieval pipelines for factually grounded recommendations
- **Multi-Modal Personalization:** Combining text (reviews, descriptions), images (listing photos, Experience galleries), user behavior (booking history, search patterns), and context (travel dates, group composition) into personalized outputs

**Live Anywhere + Experiences Marketplace**

"Airbnb's 'Live and Work Anywhere' policy means you can work from any location — and earn the same compensation regardless of where you live. This flexibility is worth $20K-$50K in effective purchasing power if you choose a lower-cost location. Combined with Airbnb's expansion into Experiences — curated activities, AI-powered trip planning, and the next $5B marketplace — every role is building both the accommodation platform AND the Experiences ecosystem. When negotiating: 'I'm building the dual marketplace — accommodations AND Experiences — that makes Airbnb a comprehensive travel platform. The Live Anywhere flexibility is a tangible financial advantage worth $20K-$50K, and the Experiences expansion means my work drives the next $5B in revenue.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue-Generating AI Product:** "I'm building the AI product that turns Airbnb from a booking platform into a comprehensive travel planning platform. AI trip planning drives bookings for BOTH accommodations AND Experiences — each itinerary I generate potentially converts into multiple bookings across both marketplaces. My equity should reflect that I'm building the revenue engine for Airbnb's next $5B+ business."
2. **No-Equivalent-Role Scarcity:** "This role doesn't exist at other companies in this exact form — there's no direct comp benchmark for 'AI Trip Planning Engineer at a global travel marketplace.' Airbnb can't low-ball by pointing to market data. I'm defining the market rate for consumer-facing LLM travel applications at 150M+ user scale."
3. **AI Premium (15-25%):** This is the purest application of the AI premium at Airbnb. Push for the full 25%: "I'm not just using AI — I'm building the flagship AI product that Airbnb is betting its next phase of growth on. This is LLM engineering at consumer scale with direct revenue attribution. The full AI premium applies."
4. **LLM Production Experience:** If you have experience shipping production LLM applications (RAG systems, fine-tuning, prompt engineering at scale, LLM evaluation), this is directly and uniquely transferable. Frame: "I've shipped production LLM applications serving [X] users with [RAG/fine-tuning/evaluation] — Airbnb is getting someone who's already solved the hardest problems in consumer-facing LLM engineering."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the product that transforms Airbnb from a booking platform into a comprehensive AI-powered travel platform. I have competing interest from [OpenAI/Anthropic/Google] at $[X] total comp. I'd like the RSU grant at $520K over 4 years with a $285K+ base, with the AI premium fully applied. I also want a guaranteed first-year refresh commitment — this product's success directly determines whether AI trip planning becomes Airbnb's next $5B+ revenue stream." Airbnb will counter at $440K-$500K RSUs — accept at $470K+ with base above $275K and the refresh guarantee. This puts total comp at $393K-$430K, which is strong for a role with unprecedented strategic importance.
