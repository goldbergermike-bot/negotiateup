### Engineering Manager | Airbnb Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | Live Anywhere Policy | Experiences Marketplace Expansion

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco / Remote | $242K–$305K | $315K–$548K | None | $321K–$442K |
| New York | $242K–$305K | $315K–$548K | None | $321K–$442K |
| London | £166K–£210K | £216K–£376K | None | £220K–£304K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Airbnb own team delivery, hiring, and technical execution across the marketplace platform. Airbnb's EM role is high-scope: you're expected to manage 6-10 engineers, own quarterly roadmaps, and drive cross-team alignment on platform initiatives spanning accommodations and Experiences. The no-bonus structure means your negotiation energy should focus entirely on base salary and RSU grant. EMs leading teams on the Experiences expansion, AI-powered trip planning, or payments infrastructure are compensated at the top of band due to strategic priority. Airbnb's flat organizational structure means EMs have unusually high autonomy and direct access to product leadership. [Source: Airbnb EM Role Framework 2025-2026]

**Live Anywhere + Experiences Marketplace**

"Airbnb's 'Live and Work Anywhere' policy means you can work from any location — and earn the same compensation regardless of where you live. This flexibility is worth $20K-$50K in effective purchasing power if you choose a lower-cost location. Combined with Airbnb's expansion into Experiences — curated activities, AI-powered trip planning, and the next $5B marketplace — every role is building both the accommodation platform AND the Experiences ecosystem. When negotiating: 'I'm building the dual marketplace — accommodations AND Experiences — that makes Airbnb a comprehensive travel platform. The Live Anywhere flexibility is a tangible financial advantage worth $20K-$50K, and the Experiences expansion means my work drives the next $5B in revenue.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Team Scope & Headcount Frame:** "I'm managing a team that ships features to 150M+ bookings annually. The Experiences expansion means my team's scope is growing — new product surfaces, new booking flows, new discovery systems. I'd like the equity grant to reflect the expanding scope of my team's impact."
2. **Dual-Marketplace Management Complexity:** Managing engineers who build for both accommodations AND Experiences is more complex than single-product EM roles at other companies. Frame: "I'm managing across two marketplaces with different user journeys, host/guest dynamics, and product requirements. This dual-marketplace complexity exceeds a typical EM role."
3. **Hiring Authority Leverage:** Airbnb EMs control headcount decisions. If your team is growing, negotiate based on the team size you'll build to: "I'm being brought in to scale this team from 6 to 12 engineers, which means I'm effectively managing twice the scope within my first year. The equity should reflect the team I'm building, not just the team I'm inheriting."
4. **Live Anywhere + Distributed Team Management:** If you're managing a distributed team across time zones (a direct result of the Live Anywhere policy), this is an additional complexity lever: "Managing a globally distributed team across time zones requires strong async communication and documentation skills that go beyond traditional EM roles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm evaluating EM roles at [Google/Meta/DoorDash] alongside Airbnb. The Experiences expansion and Live Anywhere flexibility are compelling, but I need the equity to match. I'm targeting $500K RSUs over 4 years with a base of $280K+. My track record of scaling teams on marketplace products — and the dual-marketplace complexity at Airbnb — justifies top-of-band compensation." Airbnb will counter at $420K-$470K RSUs — accept at $450K+ with base above $270K. Total comp at $383K-$420K is competitive for EM.
