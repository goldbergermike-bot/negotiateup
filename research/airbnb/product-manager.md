### Product Manager | Airbnb Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | Live Anywhere Policy | Experiences Marketplace Expansion

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco / Remote | $205K–$258K | $225K–$392K | None | $261K–$356K |
| New York | $205K–$258K | $225K–$392K | None | $261K–$356K |
| London | £141K–£177K | £155K–£269K | None | £180K–£244K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Airbnb own the strategy, roadmap, and success metrics for core product areas — search, booking, host tools, pricing, and the rapidly expanding Experiences marketplace. Airbnb's PM org is structured around the "product manager as CEO of your area" model, meaning PMs have significant autonomy over feature prioritization and go-to-market decisions. The no-bonus structure concentrates your negotiation into base + RSUs. PMs on Experiences, AI trip planning, and guest growth are the highest-priority hires in 2026. Airbnb's 2026 product focus — expanding Experiences into curated activities, restaurant reservations, and LLM-powered itinerary generation — creates exceptional PM opportunities at the intersection of travel and AI.

**Live Anywhere + Experiences Marketplace**

"Airbnb's 'Live and Work Anywhere' policy means you can work from any location — and earn the same compensation regardless of where you live. This flexibility is worth $20K-$50K in effective purchasing power if you choose a lower-cost location. Combined with Airbnb's expansion into Experiences — curated activities, AI-powered trip planning, and the next $5B marketplace — every role is building both the accommodation platform AND the Experiences ecosystem. When negotiating: 'I'm building the dual marketplace — accommodations AND Experiences — that makes Airbnb a comprehensive travel platform. The Live Anywhere flexibility is a tangible financial advantage worth $20K-$50K, and the Experiences expansion means my work drives the next $5B in revenue.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Experiences Revenue Ownership:** "I'm defining the product strategy for Experiences — Airbnb's next $5B+ business line. Each product decision I make on discovery, booking flow, and host onboarding directly determines the revenue trajectory of an entirely new marketplace. My equity should reflect this revenue ownership."
2. **AI Trip Planning PM Premium:** If your role involves AI-powered trip planning or LLM-based features, you're in the highest-demand PM niche. Frame: "I'm one of the few PMs in the industry with experience shipping AI-powered consumer products. Defining the AI trip planning experience requires both product intuition and deep AI literacy."
3. **Travel Domain Expertise:** Airbnb PMs with prior experience at Booking.com, Expedia, TripAdvisor, or Google Travel command a premium. Frame: "My travel industry experience means I understand host/guest dynamics, booking conversion, and seasonality — I'm not learning the domain, I'm applying deep expertise from day one."
4. **Competing Marketplace PM Offers:** Competing offers from DoorDash, Uber, Instacart, or Stripe create strong leverage for marketplace PM roles. Frame: "I have a competing PM offer at [marketplace company] at $[X] total comp. Airbnb's dual-marketplace scope and Experiences expansion are uniquely compelling, but the equity needs to match."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm evaluating PM roles at DoorDash and Uber alongside Airbnb. The Experiences opportunity — building an entirely new marketplace within an established platform — is what excites me most. I'm targeting $360K RSUs over 4 years with a $230K+ base. My track record of launching marketplace features that drove $[X]M in GMV maps directly to the Experiences expansion." Airbnb will counter at $300K-$340K RSUs — accept at $320K+ if base exceeds $225K.
