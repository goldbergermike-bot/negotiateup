### Security Engineer | Airbnb Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Competitive Base | Live Anywhere Policy | Experiences Marketplace Expansion

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco / Remote | $212K–$265K | $218K–$378K | None | $267K–$360K |
| New York | $212K–$265K | $218K–$378K | None | $267K–$360K |
| London | £146K–£182K | £150K–£260K | None | £184K–£247K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Airbnb protect a platform that processes billions of dollars in transactions annually, manages sensitive personal data (identity documents, payment information, location data) for hundreds of millions of users, and operates under regulatory scrutiny in 220+ countries. Airbnb's Trust & Safety and Security organizations are mission-critical: a single breach or fraud event could destroy the trust that makes the marketplace function. The 2026 Experiences expansion adds new security surface area — payment flows for curated activities, host identity verification for Experience providers, and AI trip planning data privacy. Comp follows the no-bonus model with equity as the primary lever. Security engineers with payments, fraud detection, or trust & safety experience are at the top of band.

**Live Anywhere + Experiences Marketplace**

"Airbnb's 'Live and Work Anywhere' policy means you can work from any location — and earn the same compensation regardless of where you live. This flexibility is worth $20K-$50K in effective purchasing power if you choose a lower-cost location. Combined with Airbnb's expansion into Experiences — curated activities, AI-powered trip planning, and the next $5B marketplace — every role is building both the accommodation platform AND the Experiences ecosystem. When negotiating: 'I'm building the dual marketplace — accommodations AND Experiences — that makes Airbnb a comprehensive travel platform. The Live Anywhere flexibility is a tangible financial advantage worth $20K-$50K, and the Experiences expansion means my work drives the next $5B in revenue.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Payment Security Revenue Protection:** "Airbnb processes billions in transactions annually. My work on payment security, fraud detection, and transaction integrity directly protects revenue. A single payment security incident could cost tens of millions in chargebacks and reputational damage. My equity should reflect this revenue protection role."
2. **Trust & Safety Platform Impact:** Airbnb's marketplace depends on trust between strangers. Security engineers build the identity verification, fraud prevention, and safety systems that enable this trust. Frame: "I'm engineering the trust layer that makes 150M+ nights booked annually possible. Without robust identity verification and fraud prevention, the marketplace doesn't function."
3. **Experiences Security Surface Area:** The Experiences expansion creates new attack vectors — in-person activities require different safety controls than accommodation stays, new payment flows need fraud monitoring, and AI trip planning involves sensitive personal preference data. Frame: "Experiences doubles the security surface area. I'm protecting a new marketplace with distinct threat models — in-person safety, new payment types, and AI data privacy."
4. **Global Regulatory Compliance:** Operating in 220+ countries means navigating GDPR, CCPA, PSD2, and dozens of local data protection and payment regulations. Frame: "My experience with [GDPR/PCI-DSS/SOC2/regulatory] compliance across [X] jurisdictions directly maps to Airbnb's global regulatory landscape."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm evaluating security roles at [Stripe/Google/Meta] alongside Airbnb. The combination of payment security, trust & safety, and the Experiences expansion makes Airbnb the most compelling security challenge in marketplace tech. I'm targeting $350K RSUs over 4 years with a $245K+ base. My experience in [payments security/fraud detection/trust & safety] at [company] — preventing $[X]M in fraud annually — translates directly." Airbnb will counter at $290K-$330K RSUs — accept at $310K+ with base above $235K.
