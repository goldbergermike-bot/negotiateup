#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at DigitalOcean

DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN, ~$4B market cap) is headquartered in New York City and operates as a remote-first company. The platform serves millions of developers and SMBs with simplified cloud infrastructure — Droplets (VMs), managed Kubernetes (DOKS), managed databases, Spaces (object storage), App Platform (PaaS), and Functions (serverless). DigitalOcean differentiates from AWS/Azure/GCP through simplicity, transparent pricing, and developer experience.

Software Engineers at DigitalOcean build cloud infrastructure from the ground up — hypervisor management, network virtualization, storage systems, and the control plane that orchestrates all of it. Despite being smaller than hyperscalers, the engineering challenges are comparable — building reliable, multi-tenant cloud infrastructure at scale.

DigitalOcean competes for talent with Big Tech, cloud-native startups, and other infrastructure companies. The remote-first culture and developer-focused mission attract engineers who value simplicity and developer experience.
