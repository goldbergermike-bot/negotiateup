**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Midjourney protect both the technical infrastructure and the AI model itself — securing tens of millions of image generations per day, preventing adversarial model attacks, implementing content safety guardrails, managing user data privacy at scale, and ensuring the platform isn't used for harmful content generation. At ~60 people, you might be one of very few dedicated security professionals, giving you ownership of the entire security posture. AI-specific security challenges (model jailbreaking, training data protection, generated content safety) make this role uniquely complex.
