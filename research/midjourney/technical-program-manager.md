**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Midjourney coordinate the most complex programs in creative AI — model version launches, infrastructure migrations, API platform releases, and the cross-functional efforts that ship new capabilities to tens of millions of users. At ~60 people, the TPM role is unusually broad: you might be one of very few TPMs coordinating the entire engineering organization. This means direct exposure to every technical initiative and direct access to CEO David Holz for prioritization decisions.

**Level Mapping:** Midjourney TPM = Google L5-L6 TPM = Meta TPM IC5-IC6 = Startup Director of Program Management scope
