### Senior Software Engineer | Midjourney Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Comp + Profit Sharing | Self-Funded & Profitable | San Francisco | Small Elite Team

| Region | Base Salary | Equity/Profit Sharing (Annual) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $210K-$275K | $80K-$175K+ profit sharing | — | $290K-$450K |
| Remote US | $189K-$248K | $72K-$158K+ profit sharing | — | $261K-$406K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Midjourney are among the most impactful ICs in the AI industry — with a team of ~60, senior SWEs own entire product surfaces and make architectural decisions that affect tens of millions of daily active users. You'll architect the inference serving infrastructure, design the real-time image generation pipeline, build the web platform, and establish engineering patterns for a company that processes billions of image generation requests. The scope is equivalent to Staff or Principal at a larger company.

**Level Mapping:** Midjourney Senior SWE = Google L5-L6 = Meta E5-E6 = Startup Staff SWE (scope equivalent)

**The Profitability Premium — Profit Sharing at Scale**
Senior engineers should push aggressively for profit sharing — at this level, your architectural decisions directly impact compute costs (Midjourney's largest expense) and product quality (the primary revenue driver).

**Global Levers**
1. **Staff-Equivalent Scope:** "At a company of ~60, my scope as a Senior SWE is Staff-level at any larger company. I'll own critical infrastructure serving tens of millions. That scope demands $270K base and $165K+ profit sharing."
2. **Compute Cost Optimization:** "Inference compute is Midjourney's largest expense. My infrastructure optimizations directly improve margins — a 10% reduction in serving costs saves millions annually. $265K base."
3. **Competing Offers:** "I have a Stripe Senior offer at $240K / $350K RSU and a Meta E5 offer at $225K / $350K RSU. Midjourney's profit sharing and small-team impact are compelling, but base needs to be $265K with $160K+ profit sharing."
4. **Product Velocity:** "With a small team, my individual shipping velocity has outsized impact on product capability and user growth. $270K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a senior engineer who excels in small, high-impact teams building at massive scale. Holding a Stripe Senior at $240K / $350K RSU and Meta E5 at $225K / $350K RSU. Midjourney's profitability and product-first culture are where I want to be. To join: $270K base and $160K+ annual profit sharing. At $270K, I commit. Floor is $240K."
