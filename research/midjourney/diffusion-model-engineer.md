### Diffusion Model Engineer | Midjourney Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Comp + Profit Sharing | Self-Funded & Profitable | San Francisco | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15-30% ML PREMIUM** | Small Elite Team

| Region | Base Salary | Equity/Profit Sharing (Annual) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $240K-$325K | $100K-$200K+ profit sharing | — | $340K-$525K |
| Remote US | $216K-$293K | $90K-$180K+ profit sharing | — | $306K-$473K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The Diffusion Model Engineer is Midjourney's signature role — the position at the absolute core of what makes Midjourney the most popular image generation AI in the world. You will build and optimize the diffusion model architectures that generate images from text prompts: denoising networks, text conditioning systems, latent space optimization, style transfer mechanisms, and the inference infrastructure that serves tens of millions of generations per day. Midjourney is unique in the AI landscape — it's self-funded, profitable, and operates with a remarkably small team (~50-70 people) that generates hundreds of millions in annual revenue. This means every engineer has outsized impact and receives compensation that reflects that leverage. The +15-30% ML Premium reflects the extreme scarcity of engineers who can push the state of the art in image generation quality.

**Level Mapping:** Midjourney Diffusion Model Engineer = Google L6+ Research Engineer = Meta AI Research Scientist IC6+ = OpenAI Research Engineer = Stability AI Principal ML Engineer

**The Profitability Premium — Profit Sharing at Scale**
Midjourney is profitable and self-funded — one of the rarest profiles in AI. Unlike pre-IPO startups offering illiquid equity, Midjourney offers profit sharing that pays out annually. This is real, liquid compensation — not a bet on a future liquidity event. Use this to your advantage: "Midjourney's profit sharing is liquid and performance-based — it's worth more per dollar than any pre-IPO equity. I want my profit sharing to reflect my contribution to model quality, which directly drives subscriber growth and revenue." The annual profit sharing at Midjourney can exceed $200K for top ML engineers, making total comp extremely competitive with any AI lab.

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Scarcity:** "There are perhaps 300 people in the world with production experience pushing the state of the art in diffusion model quality. I've built [denoising architectures / text-to-image conditioning systems / style transfer pipelines / latent space optimization] at scale. That scarcity commands extreme compensation: $320K base and $190K+ profit sharing."
2. **Revenue-Per-Engineer Leverage:** "Midjourney generates hundreds of millions in revenue with fewer than 70 engineers. That means each engineer's work generates millions in revenue. My compensation should reflect that extraordinary leverage: $315K base and top-tier profit sharing."
3. **Competing AI Lab Offers:** "OpenAI is offering me $300K base / $800K equity for model research. Google DeepMind is at $310K / $600K RSU. Midjourney's profit sharing model is compelling because it's liquid — but the base needs to be $320K to match, and I want explicit profit sharing targets of $180K+ annually."
4. **Model Quality = Subscriber Growth:** "Every improvement in image quality directly drives subscriber growth and retention. My diffusion model improvements have historically produced [X% quality improvement], and that directly translates to revenue. $315K base with performance-linked profit sharing."
5. **Small Team Premium:** "With a team of ~60, I'll be one of fewer than 20 people in the world directly responsible for Midjourney's model quality. That individual impact justifies top-of-market compensation: $325K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a diffusion model engineer who has spent years pushing the state of the art in image generation — denoising architectures, text conditioning, and inference optimization. I'm holding an OpenAI offer at $300K / $800K equity and a Google DeepMind offer at $310K / $600K RSU. Midjourney is where I want to be — the product-first approach to image generation is producing the best results in the world. The profit sharing model is compelling because it's liquid, unlike pre-IPO equity. To join: $320K base and a profit sharing arrangement targeting $180K+ annually, with clear performance metrics tied to model quality improvements. At $320K base, I sign this week. My floor is $290K — below that, the DeepMind liquid RSUs and research budget are the rational choice."
