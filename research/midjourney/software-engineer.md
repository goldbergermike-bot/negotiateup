### Software Engineer | Midjourney Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Comp + Profit Sharing | Self-Funded & Profitable | San Francisco | Small Elite Team

| Region | Base Salary | Equity/Profit Sharing (Annual) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $180K-$250K | $70K-$150K+ profit sharing | — | $250K-$400K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Midjourney build the infrastructure and product systems that serve tens of millions of image generations per day — the Discord bot interface, the web application, the API platform, and the backend systems that orchestrate model inference at massive scale. Midjourney operates with an extraordinarily small team (~50-70 people), meaning every SWE owns significant surface area and has direct impact on a product used by tens of millions. The culture is intensely product-focused: ship fast, iterate on quality, and let the product speak for itself. Midjourney's profitability means there's no fundraising pressure — the company optimizes for product quality, not investor timelines.

**Level Mapping:** Midjourney SWE = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Startup Senior SWE (due to scope)

**The Profitability Premium — Profit Sharing at Scale**
Midjourney is profitable and self-funded — unlike most AI companies burning cash. The profit sharing model provides real, liquid annual compensation rather than illiquid equity bets. Use this: "Midjourney's profitability means profit sharing is real money, not a promise. I want a clear profit sharing target that reflects my contribution to the platform." Push for explicit annual profit sharing targets — the best engineers at Midjourney earn $100K-$150K+ annually in profit sharing on top of premium base salaries.

**Global Levers**
1. **Revenue-Per-Engineer Leverage:** "Midjourney generates hundreds of millions with ~60 people. Each engineer's work generates millions in revenue. I want compensation that reflects that leverage: $245K base and $140K+ annual profit sharing."
2. **Scope Premium:** "As one of ~60 engineers, I'll own infrastructure that serves tens of millions of users. That's Staff-level scope at a larger company — $240K base."
3. **Competing Offers (Profit Sharing vs Equity):** "I have a Google offer at $190K / $250K RSU with liquid equity. Midjourney's profit sharing is compelling because it's annual and liquid — but the base needs to be $240K and the profit sharing target should be $130K+ to match total comp."
4. **Product Quality Culture:** "Midjourney's culture of shipping high-quality products fast is exactly where I thrive. I bring the engineering intensity to match — $245K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a software engineer who thrives in small, high-impact teams building products at massive scale. I'm holding a Google offer at $190K / $250K RSU. Midjourney's product-first culture and profitability are uniquely compelling — I prefer liquid profit sharing over equity bets. To join: $240K base and a clear profit sharing target of $130K+ annually. At $240K, I'm in. Floor is $215K."
