**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Midjourney lead small, elite teams that produce industry-leading results — a few EMs oversee the entire engineering organization that generates hundreds of millions in revenue. With ~60 total employees, EMs at Midjourney have extraordinary scope: you might manage the entire model development team or the complete platform engineering team. The flat hierarchy means you report directly or very close to CEO David Holz, with direct influence on company strategy. Midjourney's EMs are deeply technical — the culture requires hands-on engineering capability alongside people leadership.

**Level Mapping:** Midjourney EM = Google M2-Director = Meta M2 = Startup VP Engineering scope

**The Profitability Premium — Profit Sharing at Scale**
EMs multiply team output — at Midjourney's small size, that multiplication is directly visible in revenue and profitability.

**Global Levers**
1. **VP-Level Scope:** "At ~60 people, an EM at Midjourney manages a significant portion of the entire engineering org. That's VP Engineering scope at a larger company: $295K base and $185K+ profit sharing."
2. **Team Output Multiplier:** "I multiply the output of the highest-leverage engineers in AI. My team management directly drives model quality and platform capability — $290K base."
3. **Competing Offers:** "I have a Google M2 offer at $270K / $500K RSU and a Stripe Director offer at $280K / $450K RSU. Midjourney's scope and profit sharing are compelling, but base needs to be $295K with $180K+ profit sharing."
4. **Recruiting Leverage:** "Great EMs attract and retain great engineers. At Midjourney's size, every hire is critical — my ability to recruit top talent has measurable impact: $290K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm an engineering leader with experience managing ML and platform teams at scale. Holding Google M2 at $270K / $500K RSU. Midjourney's scope, profitability, and product focus are exactly what I'm looking for. To join: $295K base and $180K+ annual profit sharing. At $295K, I commit. Floor is $265K."
