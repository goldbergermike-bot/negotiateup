**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Midjourney work directly on the image generation models — training optimization, architecture improvements, inference acceleration, and the model evaluation systems that determine quality. At Midjourney, ML engineers are the core value creators: every model improvement directly drives subscriber growth and revenue. The +15-30% ML Premium reflects the extreme demand for engineers who can push the frontier of image generation quality. With Midjourney's small team, ML engineers have extraordinary individual impact — your architectural decisions and training experiments directly determine the quality of images seen by tens of millions.

**Level Mapping:** Midjourney ML/AI Engineer = Google L5-L6 ML Engineer = Meta ML Engineer IC5-IC6 = OpenAI ML Engineer = Stability AI Senior ML Engineer

**The Profitability Premium — Profit Sharing at Scale**
ML engineers are the most direct value creators at Midjourney — model quality is the product. Push for profit sharing that reflects this: "My model improvements directly drive subscriber growth. Profit sharing should scale with model quality metrics."

**Global Levers**
1. **ML Premium (+15-30%):** "Generative AI ML engineers with production diffusion model experience are among the most sought-after in tech. I have direct experience with [image generation / diffusion models / inference optimization]. That commands a 15-30% premium: $295K base."
2. **Model Quality = Revenue:** "Every model quality improvement I ship directly drives user acquisition and retention. My work has the most direct revenue impact of any role at Midjourney: $290K base and $185K+ profit sharing."
3. **Competing AI Lab Offers:** "OpenAI offers $280K / $700K equity. Anthropic offers $270K / $500K equity. Midjourney's profit sharing is liquid, which is valuable — but base needs to be $295K and profit sharing $180K+ to match total comp."
4. **Small Team, Massive Impact:** "As one of ~15 ML engineers at Midjourney, my individual model contributions have outsized impact. $295K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm an ML engineer specializing in generative image models — diffusion architectures, training optimization, inference acceleration. Holding OpenAI at $280K / $700K equity and Anthropic at $270K / $500K equity. Midjourney's liquid profit sharing and product quality are what draw me. To join: $295K base and $180K+ annual profit sharing. At $295K, I sign this week. Floor is $265K."
