**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Midjourney shape the product strategy for one of the most-used AI products in the world. Midjourney's PM role is uniquely high-leverage: with tens of millions of users and a team of ~60, PMs make decisions that affect an enormous user base with minimal bureaucracy. You'll define the product roadmap, prioritize between model improvements and product features, design the subscription and monetization strategy, and shape how millions of people interact with AI creativity. Midjourney is product-led growth in its purest form — no sales team, no marketing department, just a great product driving organic growth through word-of-mouth.
