### DevOps Engineer | Midjourney Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Comp + Profit Sharing | Self-Funded & Profitable | San Francisco | Small Elite Team | GPU Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Equity/Profit Sharing (Annual) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K-$250K | $70K-$150K+ profit sharing | — | $255K-$400K |
| Remote US | $167K-$225K | $63K-$135K+ profit sharing | — | $230K-$360K |

**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Midjourney manage one of the largest GPU inference deployments in the world — serving tens of millions of image generations per day with consistent quality and low latency. This is not traditional DevOps: you're orchestrating massive GPU clusters, optimizing inference serving for cost and performance, managing deployment pipelines for multi-gigabyte models, and ensuring the infrastructure scales with Midjourney's explosive user growth. At ~60 people, you'll own the entire infrastructure stack — from cloud provider relationships to monitoring and alerting.

**Level Mapping:** Midjourney DevOps = Google L4-L5 SRE = Meta Production Engineer IC4-IC5 = Startup Principal SRE (scope)

**The Profitability Premium — Profit Sharing at Scale**
Infrastructure costs (primarily GPU compute) are Midjourney's largest expense. DevOps engineers who optimize these costs directly improve profitability — and profit sharing.

**Global Levers**
1. **GPU Infrastructure Expertise:** "Managing GPU inference at Midjourney's scale requires specialized expertise in GPU orchestration, model serving optimization, and cost management. That AI infrastructure expertise commands a premium: $245K base."
2. **Cost Optimization = Profit Sharing:** "Every dollar I save in GPU compute costs flows directly to profitability — and profit sharing. A 5% reduction in serving costs saves millions annually. $240K base and $145K+ profit sharing."
3. **Full Stack Ownership:** "I'll own the entire infrastructure stack for one of the largest GPU deployments in AI. That's VP Infra scope at a larger company: $245K base."
4. **Competing Offers:** "I have a Datadog offer at $210K / $220K RSU and a Cloudflare offer at $205K / $200K RSU. Midjourney's GPU infrastructure challenges and profit sharing are compelling, but base needs to be $245K."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a DevOps engineer with deep GPU infrastructure experience — cluster management, inference optimization, cost engineering at scale. Holding Datadog at $210K / $220K RSU. Midjourney's infrastructure challenges are the most interesting in AI. To join: $245K base and $140K+ profit sharing. Floor is $215K."
