### Staff Software Engineer | Midjourney Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Comp + Profit Sharing | Self-Funded & Profitable | San Francisco | Small Elite Team | Technical Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Equity/Profit Sharing (Annual) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $240K-$300K | $100K-$200K+ profit sharing | — | $340K-$500K |
| Remote US | $216K-$270K | $90K-$180K+ profit sharing | — | $306K-$450K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Staff Software Engineers at Midjourney are among the most senior technical ICs in the company — at ~60 people, Staff SWEs have near-CTO-level technical authority over their domains. You'll set the architectural direction for the entire platform, drive cross-team technical initiatives (in a company where "cross-team" might mean the entire company), and make the highest-leverage engineering decisions affecting tens of millions of users. At Midjourney, Staff engineers don't just lead — they build. The culture values hands-on technical excellence, and Staff SWEs are expected to write code, review architecture, and ship features alongside the team.

**The Profitability Premium — Profit Sharing at Scale**
Staff engineers at Midjourney should negotiate for top-tier profit sharing — your architectural decisions determine compute costs, product quality, and platform scalability, all of which directly drive profitability.

**Global Levers**
1. **CTO-Level Scope:** "At Midjourney's size, Staff engineers set technical direction for the entire company. That's CTO-level scope — $295K base and $195K+ annual profit sharing."
2. **Platform Architecture Ownership:** "I'll design the systems that scale Midjourney from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of users. That architectural ownership justifies $290K base."
3. **Competing Staff/Principal Offers:** "I have a Google L6 at $260K / $600K RSU and a Stripe Staff at $270K / $500K RSU. Midjourney's profit sharing and scope are compelling, but base needs to be $295K with $190K+ profit sharing to match."
4. **Revenue Leverage:** "As one of fewer than 10 Staff-level engineers, my work has direct, measurable impact on hundreds of millions in revenue. $295K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a Staff-level engineer with experience scaling platforms to hundreds of millions of users. Holding Google L6 at $260K / $600K RSU. Midjourney's culture and profit sharing model are exactly right. To join: $295K base and $190K+ annual profit sharing. At $295K, I'm in. Floor is $265K."
