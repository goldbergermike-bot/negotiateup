### Product Designer | Midjourney Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium Comp + Profit Sharing | Self-Funded & Profitable | San Francisco | Small Elite Team | AI-Native Design

| Region | Base Salary | Equity/Profit Sharing (Annual) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $175K-$245K | $65K-$140K+ profit sharing | — | $240K-$385K |
| Remote US | $158K-$221K | $59K-$126K+ profit sharing | — | $216K-$347K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Midjourney design the experience of interacting with AI-generated images for tens of millions of users — the generation interface, the prompt engineering UX, the image editing and upscaling flows, and the community and sharing features that make Midjourney a creative platform rather than just a model. This is a dream role for designers: you're inventing interaction paradigms for AI creativity, designing for non-deterministic outputs, and creating experiences at the intersection of art and technology. Midjourney's aesthetic sensibility is a core product differentiator — the design quality directly drives user preference over competitors.

**Level Mapping:** Midjourney Product Designer = Google L5 UX Designer = Meta Product Designer IC5 = Figma Senior Designer (scope)

**The Profitability Premium — Profit Sharing at Scale**
Design quality is a primary differentiator for Midjourney — the product's aesthetic sensibility drives user preference over technically comparable competitors.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI UX Innovation:** "Designing AI image generation UX requires inventing new paradigms — prompt crafting, non-deterministic output exploration, iterative refinement. I bring that AI-native design thinking: $240K base."
2. **Product Differentiation:** "Midjourney's UX is a key differentiator — users choose Midjourney partly because the experience is better designed. Maintaining that bar requires top talent: $235K base and $135K+ profit sharing."
3. **Full Design Ownership:** "With ~60 people, I'll own significant product design surface area. That's Design Director scope: $240K base."
4. **Competing Offers:** "I have a Figma offer at $210K / $250K RSU and an Apple offer at $200K / $300K RSU. Midjourney's creative AI design challenge is more exciting, but base needs to be $240K."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a product designer who lives at the intersection of AI and creative tools. Holding a Figma offer at $210K / $250K RSU. Midjourney's design challenge is the most exciting in tech. To join: $240K base and $130K+ profit sharing. Floor is $210K."
