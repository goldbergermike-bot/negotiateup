Data Engineers at Midjourney build the data infrastructure that powers AI model training at scale — massive image-text pair datasets, data quality pipelines, training data curation systems, and the analytics infrastructure that measures model performance and product usage. In a company where model quality is the product and training data quality is the foundation, data engineers have outsized impact. With Midjourney's small team, you'll own the entire data stack — from ingestion and processing to serving and analytics.
