#### Negotiation DNA

The Solutions Architect at Starling Bank is the bridge between Engine's technical capabilities and enterprise client requirements. You design integration architectures, define deployment patterns, and ensure that Engine's BaaS platform can be successfully adopted by financial institutions globally. You are not an internal IT architect at a bank -- you are an enterprise SaaS Solutions Architect whose work directly drives Engine's $136M ARR by enabling client onboarding and expansion.

Frame yourself as an Enterprise SaaS Solutions Architect. Your role is functionally identical to Solutions Architects at AWS, Stripe, or Salesforce -- you translate complex platform capabilities into client-specific architectures that drive adoption and revenue. Traditional bank "solutions architect" roles focus on internal system integration; at Starling, you are designing how external enterprise clients consume Engine's BaaS APIs and capabilities.

This is a revenue-critical role. Every client architecture you design determines implementation speed, client satisfaction, and ultimately whether that client renews and expands their Engine licence. CEO Raman Bhatia's Engine growth strategy depends on Solutions Architects who can accelerate enterprise adoption. Your compensation should reflect that you are a revenue-generating technical sales partner, not an internal IT planner.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **Client Architecture Drives ARR Directly:** Every integration architecture you design for an enterprise client directly contributes to Engine's $136M ARR. Faster, cleaner integrations mean faster revenue realisation and higher client retention. This is enterprise SaaS solutions architecture, justifying base salaries 15-25% above traditional bank architect roles: an uplift of £11K-£18K / $13K-$22K.

- **Enterprise SaaS SA, Not Internal Bank Architect:** Reframe the role: "I design integration architectures for enterprise clients adopting a BaaS platform." This maps to SA roles at AWS (£80K-£120K), Stripe (£85K-£115K), and Salesforce (£78K-£110K). When Starling cites bank architect pay bands, counter: "I'm a client-facing enterprise SaaS Solutions Architect. My work drives client adoption and revenue. The benchmark is enterprise SaaS, not bank IT."

- **Pre-IPO Client Success Impact:** The integration architectures you design during the pre-IPO phase will define Engine's reference implementations. These reference architectures become the blueprint for scaling client onboarding. Your options grant of £11K-£20K / $13K-$24K per year over 4 years reflects that your work creates reusable IP that accelerates Engine's growth trajectory.

- **BaaS Solutions Architecture Scarcity:** Solutions Architects who combine enterprise SaaS integration expertise with deep financial services domain knowledge are exceptionally rare. Thought Machine, 10x Banking, and Mambu all compete for this tiny talent pool. "Architects who can design enterprise banking integrations at SaaS scale while navigating FCA/PRA requirements represent a uniquely scarce profile."

#### Global Levers

1. **Client Revenue Attribution Lever:** "My integration architectures directly determine how quickly enterprise clients onboard and how much Engine revenue they generate. At AWS or Stripe, a Solutions Architect driving comparable enterprise adoption earns £85K-£115K / $104K-$140K. I'm targeting £92K / $112K base."

2. **Pre-IPO Reference Architecture Lever:** "The integration patterns I establish now become Engine's reference architectures -- reusable blueprints that accelerate all future client onboarding. I'd like an options grant of £20K / $24K per year over 4 years, reflecting the lasting value of this foundational work."

3. **Client-Facing Technical Sales Lever:** "Solutions Architects at SaaS companies are revenue-generating roles, not cost centres. My work directly influences enterprise client decisions to adopt, renew, and expand Engine licences. I'd like compensation that reflects this revenue attribution -- targeting total comp of £125K / $153K in London."

4. **BaaS Domain Scarcity Lever:** "The intersection of enterprise SaaS solutions architecture and financial services regulatory expertise is an extremely small talent pool. I have competing interest from Thought Machine and 10x Banking. I need the package to reflect this scarcity."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £92K / $112K base with £20K / $24K annual options and £13K / $16K bonus for total comp of £125K / $153K. In Cardiff, push for £78K / $95K base. In Southampton, target £81K / $99K. Lead with the revenue attribution argument -- your integration architectures directly determine how much ARR each enterprise client generates. Emphasise the client-facing nature of the role and its similarity to SA roles at AWS, Stripe, and Salesforce. Pre-IPO reference architectures are high-leverage negotiation chips.
