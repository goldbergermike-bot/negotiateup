#### Negotiation DNA

As a Technical Program Manager at Starling Bank, you orchestrate the cross-functional delivery of Engine -- the BaaS platform targeting $136M ARR. You are not managing internal bank IT projects. You are driving the delivery of an enterprise SaaS product with external client commitments, enterprise SLAs, and revenue milestones tied to your program execution.

Frame yourself as a SaaS Product Program Manager. Your program management directly determines whether Engine delivers on client commitments, meets regulatory deadlines, and ships the capabilities needed to hit ARR targets. This is the same calibre of work performed by TPMs at Google, Stripe, and Amazon -- and your compensation should reflect that. Traditional bank project managers earn £50K-£68K; the tech-industry TPM benchmark is £62K-£88K because you are shipping a SaaS product, not managing internal bank projects.

The pre-IPO context adds urgency to every program you manage. Engine's delivery cadence directly affects Starling's IPO narrative. CEO Raman Bhatia needs TPMs who can drive complex, cross-functional programs in a regulated environment while maintaining the velocity of a SaaS startup. Your ability to navigate the intersection of enterprise client commitments, regulatory requirements, and engineering capacity is what makes this role uniquely valuable.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **Program Delivery = Revenue Delivery:** Every program you ship for Engine translates directly to enterprise client capabilities and revenue. Missed deadlines mean missed ARR. This is SaaS product program management, not internal bank project management. It justifies base salaries 15-20% above traditional bank PM roles: an uplift of £9K-£15K / $11K-$18K at the TPM level.

- **SaaS Product TPM, Not Bank Project Manager:** Reframe the role: "I manage cross-functional delivery of an enterprise SaaS platform serving global financial institutions." This maps to TPM roles at Google (£75K-£105K), Stripe (£70K-£95K), and Amazon (£72K-£100K). When Starling cites bank project management pay bands, counter: "I'm a SaaS Product TPM managing enterprise delivery programs. My benchmark is tech-industry TPMs, not bank project managers."

- **Pre-IPO Delivery Velocity Premium:** Engine's delivery cadence is part of Starling's IPO story. The programs you manage during the pre-IPO phase will be cited in investor materials. Your options grant of £9K-£16K / $11K-$20K per year over 4 years reflects that your delivery execution directly influences Starling's IPO narrative and timeline.

- **Regulated SaaS Program Management Scarcity:** TPMs who can drive enterprise SaaS delivery programs while navigating financial services regulatory requirements (FCA, PRA, data sovereignty) are rare. The intersection of SaaS program management velocity and regulated-industry compliance rigour is a thin talent pool: "Managing programs that must satisfy both enterprise client SLAs and financial regulator requirements is an exceptionally rare capability."

#### Global Levers

1. **Revenue Delivery Attribution Lever:** "My program delivery directly determines whether Engine meets enterprise client commitments and revenue milestones toward the $136M ARR target. At Google or Stripe, a TPM managing comparable enterprise SaaS programs earns £75K-£95K / $92K-$116K. I'm targeting £76K / $93K base."

2. **Pre-IPO Delivery Velocity Lever:** "Engine's delivery cadence is central to Starling's IPO narrative. The programs I manage will be cited in investor materials. I'd like an options grant of £16K / $20K per year over 4 years, reflecting the strategic importance of pre-IPO delivery execution."

3. **Regulated SaaS Complexity Lever:** "I manage programs at the intersection of enterprise SaaS velocity and financial services regulation. This is substantially more complex than either pure SaaS program management or pure bank project management. I'm targeting total comp of £103K / $126K in London to reflect this dual complexity."

4. **Cross-Functional Impact Lever:** "As a TPM, I'm the connective tissue between engineering, product, compliance, and enterprise client teams. My program execution determines whether Engine's cross-functional machinery works smoothly. This orchestration role is critical enough to justify top-band compensation."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £76K / $93K base with £16K / $20K annual options and £11K / $13K bonus for total comp of £103K / $126K. In Cardiff, push for £65K / $79K base. In Southampton, target £67K / $82K. Lead with the revenue delivery attribution argument -- your programs directly determine whether Engine meets ARR targets and enterprise client commitments. Emphasise the dual complexity of regulated SaaS program management. Reference Google, Stripe, and Amazon TPM benchmarks as primary comparators.
