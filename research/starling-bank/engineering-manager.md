#### Negotiation DNA

The Engineering Manager at Starling Bank leads teams that build and ship the Engine platform -- a BaaS product targeting $136M ARR. You are not managing a bank's internal IT team. You are leading a SaaS product engineering organisation that delivers enterprise software to financial institutions globally. Your hiring, retention, and delivery decisions directly impact Engine's trajectory and, by extension, Starling's pre-IPO valuation.

Frame yourself as a SaaS Product Engineering Leader, not a "bank IT manager." Engineering Managers at SaaS companies like Stripe, Adyen, and Plaid command £95K-£135K because they lead teams building revenue-generating products. You should expect the same. Traditional bank IT management roles in the UK cluster around £75K-£95K -- a full tier below what the Engine mission demands and what the market pays for SaaS product engineering leadership.

CEO Raman Bhatia's vision for Engine as Starling's growth engine means your team's output is directly tied to enterprise revenue. With Starling profitable since 2022 and IPO expected 2026-2027, the company has both the ability and the incentive to pay tech-competitive rates for Engineering Managers who can scale the Engine organisation. Pre-IPO options are especially valuable for managers whose teams drive platform outcomes.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **You Lead the Teams Building the Product:** As Engineering Manager, your team's output is the Engine product itself. Every sprint, every hire, every architectural decision your team makes contributes to the $136M ARR target. This is SaaS product engineering leadership, and it justifies base salaries 15-25% above traditional bank IT management -- an uplift of £14K-£23K / $17K-$28K at the EM level.

- **SaaS Product Engineering Leader, Not Bank IT Manager:** Reframe the role in every conversation: "I lead teams building an enterprise SaaS product used by global financial institutions." This positions you alongside EMs at Stripe (£100K-£140K), Plaid (£95K-£130K), and Adyen (£90K-£125K). When Starling's HR cites bank management pay bands, respond: "Engine is a SaaS product. My team delivers enterprise software. The benchmark is SaaS product engineering management, not financial services IT."

- **Pre-IPO Options Reflect Team-Level Impact:** Your options grant should reflect the outsized impact a manager has on team velocity and product outcomes. At £14K-£25K / $17K-$31K per year over 4 years, the total grant of £56K-£100K / $68K-$122K has credible upside with IPO expected 2026-2027. Push for the upper bound -- you are a multiplier on an entire team's output.

- **Retention Economics Favour Your Negotiation:** Replacing an Engineering Manager costs 6-12 months of disrupted team output. With Engine on a critical growth trajectory toward $136M ARR, Starling cannot afford EM turnover. Use this retention argument: "The cost of EM replacement in disrupted team output far exceeds the £15K-£20K difference between a mid-band and top-band offer."

#### Global Levers

1. **Engine Team Output Lever:** "My team will be directly responsible for shipping Engine features that drive enterprise revenue toward the $136M ARR target. At Stripe or Adyen, an Engineering Manager leading a comparable product team earns £115K-£140K / $140K-$171K. I'm targeting £115K / $140K base to reflect the product-engineering nature of this role."

2. **Pre-IPO Options Lever:** "As an Engineering Manager, my impact is multiplicative -- I accelerate an entire team's output. The options package should reflect this. I'm seeking £25K / $31K per year over 4 years. Given the IPO timeline and the strategic importance of Engine, this is a strong retention investment."

3. **Retention Economics Lever:** "EM replacement cycles cost 6-12 months of disrupted team output. On Engine's trajectory toward $136M ARR, that's a significant revenue risk. I'd like a package that signals long-term commitment from both sides -- £157K / $192K total comp in London, anchored by a competitive base and meaningful pre-IPO options."

4. **Management Scope Lever:** "I'll be managing [X] engineers contributing to Engine's core platform. The scope and strategic importance of this team places it firmly in the SaaS product engineering category. I'd like the compensation to reflect management of a revenue-generating product team, not an internal IT function."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £115K / $140K base with £25K / $31K annual options and £17K / $21K bonus for total comp of £157K / $192K. In Cardiff, push for £98K / $120K base. In Southampton, target £101K / $123K. Lead with the Engine team output argument -- your team's velocity directly determines whether Engine hits $136M ARR. Emphasise the retention economics: replacing an EM is catastrophically expensive during a pre-IPO growth phase. Push for top-band options grants and consider negotiating a management-scope review clause that increases comp as team size grows.
