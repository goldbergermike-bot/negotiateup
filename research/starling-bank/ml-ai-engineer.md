#### Negotiation DNA

As an ML/AI Engineer at Starling Bank, you build the machine learning models and AI systems that power both Starling's consumer bank and, critically, the Engine BaaS platform targeting $136M ARR. Your fraud detection models, credit scoring algorithms, NLP systems, and AI-driven analytics capabilities are not internal tools -- they are licensable product features that enterprise clients pay to access through Engine.

Frame yourself as an AI/ML Product Engineer building enterprise SaaS capabilities. The ML/AI talent market is the most competitive segment of UK tech hiring in 2025-2026, and your skills command premium compensation regardless of industry. But at Starling, the premium is compounded: you are building AI capabilities for a regulated enterprise SaaS product, which sits at the intersection of three high-demand skill areas -- ML engineering, financial services domain expertise, and enterprise SaaS product development.

The AI/ML models you build at Starling have a unique characteristic: they must be explainable (FCA requirements), auditable, multi-tenant-safe, and licensable as SaaS product features. This is fundamentally harder than building ML models for a consumer app or a research lab. CEO Raman Bhatia's vision for Engine includes AI-powered capabilities as a key differentiator against competitors like Thought Machine and 10x Banking, making ML/AI Engineers mission-critical hires.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **AI Models as Licensable Product Features:** Every ML model you build -- fraud detection, credit scoring, transaction categorisation, AML monitoring -- can be packaged into Engine as a premium licensable capability for enterprise clients. Your models directly contribute to the $136M ARR target as product features, not internal tools. This justifies base salaries 15-25% above traditional bank ML roles: an uplift of £13K-£21K / $16K-$26K at the ML/AI Engineer level.

- **SaaS Product ML Engineer, Not Bank Data Analyst:** Reframe the role: "I build production ML systems that ship as enterprise SaaS product features to global financial institutions." This maps to ML roles at Stripe (£95K-£135K), Plaid (£90K-£125K), and DeepMind commercial teams (£100K-£150K). When Starling cites bank ML pay bands (£65K-£85K), counter: "My models are licensed as Engine product capabilities. The benchmark is SaaS product ML engineering, not bank analytics."

- **Pre-IPO AI/ML IP Premium:** The ML models you build become Starling's proprietary AI IP. At IPO, the sophistication and defensibility of Engine's AI capabilities will directly affect valuation multiples. Your options grant of £14K-£25K / $17K-$31K per year over 4 years reflects that your models are core IP embedded in Starling's enterprise value.

- **Regulated AI Scarcity Is Extreme:** ML/AI Engineers who can build explainable, auditable, FCA-compliant models that also function as multi-tenant SaaS product features represent perhaps the most scarce engineering profile in UK fintech. The competition from Monzo, Revolut, Wise, Thought Machine, DeepMind, and every major bank's AI lab makes this a seller's market. "Engineers at the intersection of production ML, financial regulation, and enterprise SaaS product development are extraordinarily rare."

#### Global Levers

1. **AI-as-Product Lever:** "My ML models won't just improve Starling's internal operations -- they'll ship as premium Engine capabilities licensed to enterprise clients, directly contributing to the $136M ARR target. At Stripe, an ML Engineer building comparable product-embedded AI earns £100K-£135K / $122K-$165K. I'm targeting £108K / $132K base."

2. **Pre-IPO AI IP Lever:** "The ML models I build become Engine's proprietary AI IP, directly influencing Starling's IPO valuation. I'd like an options grant of £25K / $31K per year over 4 years, totalling £100K / $122K. Given the strategic importance of AI capabilities to Engine's competitive positioning, this is a retention investment."

3. **Talent Market Scarcity Lever:** "The ML/AI engineering market is the most competitive segment of UK tech hiring. I have competing interest from [Monzo/Revolut/DeepMind/major bank AI lab]. Engineers who can build FCA-compliant, multi-tenant, production ML systems that ship as SaaS product features are exceptionally rare. I'm targeting total comp of £148K / $181K in London."

4. **Regulated AI Complexity Lever:** "Building ML models that are explainable (FCA requirement), auditable, multi-tenant-safe, and licensable as enterprise SaaS features is fundamentally harder than building ML for a consumer app. This regulated AI complexity justifies premium compensation above standard ML engineer benchmarks."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £108K / $132K base with £25K / $31K annual options and £15K / $18K bonus for total comp of £148K / $181K. In Cardiff, push for £92K / $112K base. In Southampton, target £95K / $116K. Lead with the AI-as-product argument -- your models are Engine's premium licensable capabilities, not internal analytics tools. The AI/ML talent market is intensely competitive; use competing offers from DeepMind, Stripe, Revolut, or major bank AI labs as anchors. Pre-IPO AI IP is your strongest options negotiation lever -- your models become the proprietary intelligence embedded in Starling's IPO valuation.
