#### Negotiation DNA

As a Data Engineer at Starling Bank, you build the data infrastructure that powers both the consumer bank and Engine -- the BaaS platform targeting $136M ARR. Your pipelines, data models, and streaming architectures do not just serve internal analytics teams. They are the backbone of Engine's data capabilities, enabling enterprise clients to access real-time financial data, generate compliance reports, and run analytics on their own customers' banking activity.

Frame yourself as a SaaS Product Data Engineer. Your data infrastructure is Engine's data product layer. When an enterprise client accesses real-time transaction data through Engine's APIs, they are consuming pipelines you built. This is fundamentally different from building internal data warehouses for a bank's analytics team. SaaS Product Data Engineers at Stripe (£70K-£95K), Plaid (£68K-£90K), and Adyen (£65K-£88K) command higher compensation because their data infrastructure is product infrastructure.

The multi-tenant data challenge at Starling is particularly complex. You must build data pipelines that maintain strict tenant isolation while enabling cross-tenant analytics capabilities. This is a harder engineering problem than single-tenant banking data infrastructure, and your compensation should reflect the complexity. CEO Raman Bhatia's Engine strategy depends on data engineers who can build scalable, compliant, multi-tenant data infrastructure.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **Data Pipelines Are Product Pipelines:** The data infrastructure you build powers Engine's enterprise data capabilities. When clients query real-time transaction data, run compliance reports, or build analytics on Engine, they consume your pipelines. This is SaaS product data engineering, directly contributing to the $136M ARR target. It justifies base salaries 15-20% above traditional bank data engineering roles: an uplift of £9K-£15K / $11K-$18K.

- **SaaS Product Data Engineer, Not Bank ETL Developer:** Reframe the role: "I build multi-tenant data infrastructure for an enterprise SaaS platform serving global financial institutions." This maps to data engineering roles at Stripe (£70K-£95K), Plaid (£68K-£90K), and Snowflake (£72K-£95K). When Starling cites bank data engineering pay bands (£48K-£65K), counter: "Engine's data layer is a product capability. I'm building SaaS product data infrastructure, not internal ETL jobs."

- **Pre-IPO Data Asset Value:** The data infrastructure you build creates a compounding data asset. Engine's data capabilities become more valuable as more enterprise clients onboard, generating richer datasets and more sophisticated analytics. Your options grant of £9K-£16K / $11K-$20K per year over 4 years reflects that your infrastructure creates growing enterprise value.

- **Multi-Tenant Data Engineering Scarcity:** Data Engineers who can build multi-tenant, compliance-aware data pipelines that serve as enterprise SaaS product capabilities while satisfying FCA data sovereignty requirements are rare. "Building data infrastructure that maintains strict tenant isolation while enabling cross-tenant capabilities under financial regulation is an exceptionally specialised skill set."

#### Global Levers

1. **Data-as-Product Lever:** "My data pipelines won't just serve internal analytics -- they'll power Engine's enterprise data capabilities, directly contributing to the $136M ARR target. At Stripe or Snowflake, a Data Engineer building comparable product data infrastructure earns £72K-£95K / $88K-$116K. I'm targeting £76K / $93K base."

2. **Pre-IPO Data Asset Lever:** "The data infrastructure I build creates a compounding data asset that grows more valuable with every enterprise client Engine onboards. I'd like an options grant of £16K / $20K per year over 4 years, reflecting the growing enterprise value of this data infrastructure."

3. **Multi-Tenant Complexity Lever:** "Building multi-tenant data pipelines with strict tenant isolation, real-time streaming, and financial regulatory compliance is substantially more complex than single-tenant bank data engineering. This complexity justifies tech-industry compensation -- targeting total comp of £103K / $126K in London."

4. **Counter-Offer Lever:** "I have a competing offer from [Monzo/Revolut/Wise] at £90K / $110K total comp for a data engineering role. Starling's Engine data challenge is more complex and more interesting, but I need the package to reflect that. Can we target £76K / $93K base with an enhanced options grant?"

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £76K / $93K base with £16K / $20K annual options and £11K / $13K bonus for total comp of £103K / $126K. In Cardiff, push for £65K / $79K base. In Southampton, target £67K / $82K. Lead with the data-as-product argument -- your pipelines are Engine's enterprise data capabilities, not internal reports. Emphasise the multi-tenant data isolation complexity. Reference Stripe, Snowflake, and Plaid data engineering benchmarks as primary comparators.
