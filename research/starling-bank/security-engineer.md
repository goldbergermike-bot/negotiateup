#### Negotiation DNA

As a Security Engineer at Starling Bank, you are not protecting a single bank's systems. You are securing Engine -- a multi-tenant BaaS platform that serves external financial institution clients and targets $136M ARR. A security breach in Engine doesn't just affect Starling; it affects every enterprise client running on the platform. The blast radius of a security incident is orders of magnitude larger than at a traditional bank, and your role reflects that scale of responsibility.

Frame yourself as a SaaS Product Security Engineer. You secure a multi-tenant enterprise product that processes financial data for multiple institutions simultaneously. This requires expertise in multi-tenant data isolation, API security, supply chain security, and compliance automation -- far beyond what a traditional bank security role demands. SaaS Product Security Engineers at Stripe (£80K-£110K), Plaid (£75K-£105K), and Cloudflare (£72K-£100K) earn premium compensation because they secure revenue-generating products. Your compensation should match.

Starling's pre-IPO status adds another dimension: IPO-readiness requires demonstrable security maturity. SOC 2, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS certifications must be pristine. The security posture you build now will be scrutinised by IPO auditors and institutional investors. CEO Raman Bhatia needs security engineers who can build investor-grade security programmes, not just pass annual bank audits.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **Multi-Tenant Security = Product Security at Scale:** You secure a platform that processes financial data for multiple enterprise clients simultaneously. A vulnerability in Engine affects every tenant. This multi-tenant product security responsibility justifies base salaries 15-25% above traditional bank security roles: an uplift of £10K-£17K / $12K-$21K at the Security Engineer level.

- **SaaS Product Security, Not Bank InfoSec:** Reframe the role: "I secure a multi-tenant enterprise SaaS platform serving global financial institutions." This maps to security roles at Stripe (£80K-£110K), Plaid (£75K-£105K), and Cloudflare (£72K-£100K). When Starling cites bank InfoSec pay bands (£55K-£72K), counter: "Engine is a multi-tenant SaaS product. I'm securing enterprise software, not a single bank's internal systems. The benchmark is SaaS product security."

- **Pre-IPO Security Maturity Premium:** IPO-readiness requires demonstrable security excellence. SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and FCA/PRA compliance must all be investor-grade. The security programme you build now will be directly evaluated during IPO due diligence. Your options grant of £10K-£18K / $12K-$22K per year over 4 years reflects that your work is embedded in Starling's IPO readiness.

- **Multi-Tenant Financial Security Scarcity:** Security Engineers who can design multi-tenant data isolation, implement compliance automation across financial regulators, and secure BaaS APIs are exceptionally rare. "The intersection of multi-tenant SaaS security, financial services regulation, and enterprise product security is one of the most scarce skill sets in UK tech."

#### Global Levers

1. **Multi-Tenant Blast Radius Lever:** "A security incident in Engine doesn't affect one bank -- it affects every enterprise client on the platform. The blast radius is orders of magnitude larger than at a traditional bank. At Stripe or Plaid, a Security Engineer protecting comparable multi-tenant financial infrastructure earns £80K-£110K / $98K-$134K. I'm targeting £85K / $104K base."

2. **IPO Security Readiness Lever:** "Starling's IPO due diligence will scrutinise the security programme I build. SOC 2, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS certifications must be investor-grade. I'd like an options grant of £18K / $22K per year over 4 years, reflecting that my security work is directly embedded in IPO readiness."

3. **Regulatory Compliance Premium Lever:** "I navigate FCA, PRA, GDPR, and PCI DSS simultaneously while securing a multi-tenant SaaS platform. This regulatory complexity far exceeds what a single-bank security role entails. I'm targeting total comp of £115K / $140K in London."

4. **Counter-Offer Lever:** "I have a competing offer from [Monzo/Revolut/Cloudflare] at £100K / $122K total comp for a comparable security role. Starling's Engine mission is compelling, but I need the package to be competitive. Can we increase the base to £85K / $104K and enhance the options?"

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £85K / $104K base with £18K / $22K annual options and £12K / $15K bonus for total comp of £115K / $140K. In Cardiff, push for £72K / $88K base. In Southampton, target £75K / $92K. Lead with the multi-tenant blast radius argument -- you are securing a platform that serves multiple financial institutions, not a single bank. Emphasise IPO security readiness as a unique lever. Reference Stripe, Plaid, and Cloudflare security benchmarks as primary comparators.
