#### Negotiation DNA

The Staff Software Engineer at Starling Bank is an organisational force multiplier. You define technical strategy across multiple teams, own platform-wide architectural decisions, and directly shape the trajectory of Engine -- the BaaS platform targeting $136M ARR. At this level, your decisions don't just affect code quality; they determine whether Engine can scale to serve dozens of enterprise financial institution clients simultaneously.

You are a SaaS Product Architect in the truest sense. Your work defines the multi-tenant architecture, the API contracts, the scalability patterns, and the compliance frameworks that make Engine a licensable enterprise product. This is the same calibre of work performed by Staff Engineers at Stripe, Plaid, and Adyen -- and your compensation should reflect that. Traditional UK banking Staff Engineer roles (where they exist at all) pay £80K-£100K; the tech-industry benchmark for this level of impact is £112K-£162K because you are building a SaaS product, not maintaining internal systems.

With Starling profitable since 2022 and CEO Raman Bhatia positioning Engine as the company's primary growth vector, Staff Engineers are mission-critical hires. The pre-IPO options component is especially significant at this level -- you are joining at the optimal moment to capture equity upside before the expected 2026-2027 IPO. Negotiate aggressively on the options grant; at the Staff level, you have the leverage to command a premium package.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **Platform Architecture = Product Architecture:** At the Staff level, you are not just writing features -- you are defining Engine's technical architecture. Every decision about multi-tenancy, API design, data isolation, and compliance automation directly determines Engine's viability as a $136M ARR enterprise product. This is enterprise SaaS product architecture, and it commands a premium of £20K-£35K / $24K-$43K above traditional bank tech Staff roles.

- **SaaS Product Architect at the Organisational Level:** Your influence spans multiple teams and shapes the technical direction of an entire SaaS platform. Frame your impact as "defining the technical strategy for an enterprise SaaS product serving global financial institutions." This positions you alongside Staff Engineers at Thought Machine (£120K-£155K), Stripe (£130K-£170K), and Adyen (£115K-£150K). When Starling cites internal bank pay bands, counter: "I am architecting a SaaS product. My comp benchmark is enterprise SaaS, not financial services IT."

- **Pre-IPO Options at Staff Level Are Transformational:** Your options grant at Staff level should be £18K-£32K / $22K-$39K per year over 4 years, totalling £72K-£128K / $88K-$156K. With Starling profitable and IPO imminent, these options represent credible wealth creation. Push for the maximum grant -- you are one of the few engineers whose architectural decisions will determine Engine's enterprise value at IPO.

- **Scarcity of Staff-Level BaaS Architects:** There are perhaps a few hundred engineers in the UK who can architect enterprise-grade, multi-tenant banking-as-a-service platforms. You are in an extremely scarce talent pool. Thought Machine, 10x Banking, Mambu, and Temenos are all competing for the same candidates. Use this scarcity to justify premium compensation: "The intersection of Staff-level systems architecture and financial services domain expertise is extremely rare. My compensation should reflect that scarcity."

#### Global Levers

1. **Platform Architecture Impact Lever:** "At the Staff level, my architectural decisions will define Engine's ability to scale to $136M ARR. I'll be setting the technical strategy for a multi-tenant BaaS platform serving global enterprise clients. At Thought Machine, a Staff Architect earns £130K-£155K / $159K-$189K. I'm targeting £138K / $168K base to reflect the scope and impact of this role."

2. **Pre-IPO Wealth Creation Lever:** "The Staff Engineer options package should reflect my outsized impact on Engine's enterprise value. I'm seeking a 4-year grant totalling £128K / $156K -- that's £32K / $39K per year. Given the IPO timeline and my role in defining Engine's architecture, this is a strategic retention investment."

3. **Scarcity Premium Lever:** "Engineers who can architect enterprise-grade, multi-tenant, regulated SaaS platforms are exceptionally rare in the UK market. I have competing interest from Thought Machine, 10x Banking, and [major cloud provider]. I'd like the total comp package to reflect the scarcity of this skill set -- targeting £190K / $232K total comp in London."

4. **Regional Parity Lever (Cardiff/Southampton):** "At the Staff level, my impact is organisational and platform-wide, not location-dependent. I'm defining architecture for a global SaaS product. I'd like to negotiate the Cardiff discount down to 5%, bringing my base to £131K / $160K rather than the standard 15% reduction."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £138K / $168K base with £32K / $39K annual options and £20K / $24K bonus for total comp of £190K / $232K. In Cardiff, push for £117K / $143K base (arguing for a reduced 5-8% regional adjustment). In Southampton, target £121K / $148K. At the Staff level, lead with platform architecture impact -- your decisions determine whether Engine reaches $136M ARR. Pre-IPO options are your most valuable lever; negotiate for the maximum 4-year grant and consider requesting an accelerated vesting schedule or IPO-triggered acceleration clause. Reference Thought Machine and Stripe Staff Engineer benchmarks as your primary comparators.
