#### Negotiation DNA

As a Product Designer at Starling Bank, you are designing the interfaces, workflows, and design systems for Engine -- an enterprise BaaS platform targeting $136M ARR. This is not consumer app design. You are creating enterprise-grade user experiences for financial institution clients who integrate Engine into their own banking operations. The complexity of B2B SaaS design in a regulated industry is substantially higher than consumer product design.

Frame yourself as a B2B SaaS Product Designer, not a "banking app designer." Enterprise SaaS designers at companies like Stripe, Plaid, and Adyen command higher compensation because they solve complex information architecture, multi-tenant configuration, and developer experience challenges. Traditional bank design roles focus on consumer interfaces; Engine design requires enterprise dashboard UX, API documentation design, white-label systems, and compliance workflow design.

The design decisions you make for Engine directly affect enterprise client adoption, retention, and willingness to pay premium licensing fees. Poor enterprise UX means clients churn; excellent enterprise UX drives ARR growth. Your work is directly tied to Engine's $136M revenue target, and your compensation should reflect that connection.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **Enterprise UX Drives Enterprise Revenue:** Your designs determine how financial institution clients experience Engine. A well-designed enterprise platform reduces onboarding friction, increases client retention, and justifies premium licensing fees -- all contributing to the $136M ARR target. This justifies base salaries 15-20% above traditional bank design roles: an uplift of £8K-£13K / $10K-$16K at the Product Designer level.

- **B2B SaaS Designer, Not Consumer App Designer:** Reframe the role: "I design enterprise software experiences for global financial institutions." This maps to design roles at Stripe (£60K-£85K), Plaid (£55K-£78K), and Adyen (£52K-£75K). When Starling cites bank design pay bands (£42K-£58K), counter: "Engine is a B2B SaaS product. My work encompasses enterprise dashboard design, multi-tenant configuration UX, and developer experience. The benchmark is enterprise SaaS design."

- **Pre-IPO Design Impact:** The design system and UX patterns you establish now will be baked into Engine's product identity at IPO. Enterprise clients evaluate SaaS products partly on design quality. The options grant of £7K-£14K / $9K-$17K per year over 4 years should reflect that your design decisions directly influence Engine's market positioning.

- **Regulated Enterprise UX Scarcity:** Designers who can navigate financial services compliance requirements while creating elegant enterprise SaaS experiences are rare. The intersection of B2B SaaS design and regulated-industry expertise commands a scarcity premium. "Finding designers who can create both compliant and delightful enterprise banking experiences is a very small talent pool."

#### Global Levers

1. **Enterprise Design Impact Lever:** "My designs will directly influence how enterprise clients experience Engine, affecting adoption, retention, and willingness to pay premium licenses -- all contributing to the $136M ARR target. At Stripe, a Product Designer working on enterprise products earns £65K-£85K / $79K-$104K. I'm targeting £65K / $79K base."

2. **Pre-IPO Options Lever:** "Design decisions made now will define Engine's product identity at IPO. I'd like an options grant of £14K / $17K per year over 4 years, reflecting the lasting impact of foundational design decisions during the pre-IPO stage."

3. **B2B Design Complexity Lever:** "Engine design involves enterprise dashboards, multi-tenant configuration UX, API documentation design, and white-label systems -- substantially more complex than consumer banking app design. This B2B SaaS design complexity justifies benchmarking against enterprise SaaS companies, not traditional banks."

4. **Design System Foundation Lever:** "I'll be establishing design patterns and systems that scale across Engine's growing enterprise client base. These foundational design decisions compound in value as Engine adds clients. I'm targeting total comp of £88K / $107K in London to reflect this foundational, high-leverage contribution."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £65K / $79K base with £14K / $17K annual options and £9K / $11K bonus for total comp of £88K / $107K. In Cardiff, push for £55K / $67K base. In Southampton, target £57K / $70K. Lead with the B2B SaaS design complexity argument -- you are designing enterprise software experiences, not a consumer banking app. Emphasise the foundational nature of design system decisions during the pre-IPO phase. Reference Stripe and Plaid design benchmarks as primary comparators.
