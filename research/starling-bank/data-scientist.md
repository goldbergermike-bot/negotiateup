#### Negotiation DNA

As a Data Scientist at Starling Bank, you build the models, analytics, and insights that power both the consumer bank and the Engine enterprise platform. Your work on credit risk, fraud detection, customer behaviour modelling, and operational analytics does not just serve Starling's 4M+ consumer accounts -- it becomes intellectual property embedded in Engine, the BaaS platform targeting $136M ARR. When your risk model gets packaged into Engine, it becomes a licensable product feature generating enterprise revenue.

Frame yourself as a SaaS Product Data Scientist. Your models are not internal analytics tools -- they are product features that get licensed to financial institutions. This distinction is critical for compensation: SaaS Product Data Scientists at companies like Stripe (£75K-£105K), Adyen (£70K-£95K), and Plaid (£72K-£100K) earn significantly more than traditional bank data analysts (£50K-£70K) because their work ships as product.

With Starling profitable since 2022 and CEO Raman Bhatia scaling Engine aggressively, Data Scientists who can build models that become licensable Engine capabilities are mission-critical hires. Your pre-IPO options are especially valuable because your models will be embedded in the product that drives Starling's IPO valuation.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **Your Models Become Product Features:** Every risk model, fraud detection algorithm, and analytics capability you build can be packaged into Engine and licensed to enterprise clients. Your data science work directly contributes to the $136M ARR target -- not as internal analysis, but as product features. This justifies base salaries 15-25% above traditional bank data science roles: an uplift of £10K-£16K / $12K-$20K.

- **SaaS Product Data Scientist Framing:** Position yourself as "a Data Scientist building models that ship as enterprise SaaS product features." This maps to product-focused DS roles at Stripe (£75K-£105K), Plaid (£72K-£100K), and Featurespace (£70K-£95K). When Starling cites internal bank DS pay bands, counter: "My models are licensed as Engine product capabilities. The benchmark is SaaS product data science, not bank analytics."

- **Pre-IPO Model IP Value:** The models you build now become Engine's proprietary IP. At IPO, the sophistication and defensibility of Engine's analytics capabilities will directly affect valuation. Your options grant of £10K-£18K / $12K-$22K per year should reflect that your models are embedded in the enterprise value being created.

- **Regulated AI/ML Scarcity:** Data Scientists who can build production-grade models that satisfy financial services regulatory requirements (FCA, PRA) while also functioning as licensable SaaS product features represent a rare skill intersection. "The combination of rigorous statistical modelling, financial services regulation expertise, and SaaS product orientation is an exceptionally scarce profile."

#### Global Levers

1. **Model-as-Product Lever:** "My risk and analytics models won't just serve Starling's consumer bank -- they'll be packaged into Engine as licensable capabilities contributing to the $136M ARR target. At Stripe or Featurespace, a Data Scientist building product-embedded models earns £80K-£105K / $98K-$128K. I'm targeting £82K / $100K base."

2. **Pre-IPO IP Lever:** "The models I build will become Engine's proprietary analytical IP, directly influencing Starling's IPO valuation. I'd like an options grant of £18K / $22K per year over 4 years, reflecting the lasting IP value of these models."

3. **Regulated ML Scarcity Lever:** "Data Scientists who can build FCA/PRA-compliant models that also function as enterprise SaaS product features are exceptionally rare. I bring this intersection and expect compensation that reflects it -- targeting total comp of £112K / $137K in London."

4. **Counter-Offer Lever:** "I have a competing offer from [Monzo/Revolut/Featurespace] at £95K / $116K total comp. Starling's Engine mission is my preference, but I need the package to be competitive. Can we increase the base to £82K / $100K and enhance the options grant?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £82K / $100K base with £18K / $22K annual options and £12K / $15K bonus for total comp of £112K / $137K. In Cardiff, push for £70K / $85K base. In Southampton, target £72K / $88K. Lead with the model-as-product argument -- your data science work ships as Engine product features, not internal reports. Emphasise the IP value of models you build during the pre-IPO phase. Reference Stripe, Featurespace, and Plaid DS benchmarks as primary comparators.
