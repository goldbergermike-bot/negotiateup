#### Negotiation DNA

At the Senior Software Engineer level, you are the backbone of Starling's engineering organisation. You own subsystems, lead technical design, mentor juniors, and make architectural decisions that directly shape the Engine platform -- a BaaS product targeting $136M ARR. You are not maintaining a banking application; you are building an enterprise SaaS product that is licensed to financial institutions across the globe.

The "SaaS Product Architect" framing is especially powerful at this level because Senior Engineers at Starling are expected to operate with the autonomy and impact of senior individual contributors at companies like Stripe, Plaid, or Adyen. Your compensation should reflect that you are designing multi-tenant, API-first, regulated infrastructure that generates direct enterprise revenue. Traditional bank-tech Senior Engineer salaries in the UK cluster around £60K-£75K; your target should be £78K-£112K because you are building a SaaS product, not an internal IT system.

Starling's profitability since 2022 and CEO Raman Bhatia's commitment to Engine as the company's growth vector mean there is budget for tech-competitive compensation. The pre-IPO equity component is particularly valuable at this level -- a strong options grant now, ahead of the expected 2026-2027 IPO, could represent significant upside. Negotiate hard on the initial options grant; it is the single highest-leverage item in your package.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **You Build the Product That Gets Licensed:** At the Senior level, your architectural decisions define the Engine platform's capabilities. Every API endpoint, every multi-tenancy feature, every compliance module you design is sold to external financial institutions contributing to the $136M ARR target. This is enterprise SaaS product engineering. Demand compensation that reflects it: £12K-£22K / $15K-$27K above what a traditional bank would pay a Senior Engineer.

- **SaaS Product Architect Reframing at Scale:** Frame your experience as building "enterprise SaaS for regulated industries." This language maps directly to roles at Thought Machine (£90K-£120K), 10x Banking (£85K-£115K), and Mambu (£80K-£110K). When Starling's recruiter cites internal bank pay bands, counter: "My work ships as a licensed product to external enterprise customers. The comparable market is enterprise SaaS, not bank IT."

- **Pre-IPO Options Are Worth More at Senior Level:** Your options grant at the Senior level should be £12K-£22K / $15K-$27K per year over 4 years. With IPO expected 2026-2027 and Starling profitable since 2022, these options have a credible path to liquidity. Push for the upper end of the range -- a total 4-year grant of £88K / $107K is justifiable given the impact you will have on Engine's ARR.

- **The BaaS Talent War Favours You:** Thought Machine, 10x Banking, Mambu, and Temenos are all competing for the same Senior Engineers who can build multi-tenant, cloud-native banking platforms. Starling must pay competitively or lose candidates to these direct competitors. Use competing offers (or even recruiter outreach) from these companies as calibration. The BaaS market's projected $12.2B valuation by 2028 means this talent war will only intensify.

#### Global Levers

1. **Engine ARR Attribution Lever:** "As a Senior Engineer, I'll own subsystems that directly contribute to Engine's $136M ARR target. At Thought Machine, a Senior Engineer building comparable BaaS infrastructure earns £90K-£120K / $110K-$146K. I'd like to target £98K / $120K base to reflect the enterprise SaaS nature of this work."

2. **Pre-IPO Options Maximisation Lever:** "Starling's pre-IPO stage is a unique window for equity compensation. I'd like to discuss an enhanced options package of £22K / $27K per year over 4 years. Given the IPO timeline of 2026-2027 and the company's profitability, this is a meaningful investment in retention for a Senior Engineer who will shape Engine's architecture."

3. **Competitive Market Lever:** "I'm currently evaluating offers from [Monzo/Revolut/Thought Machine] at £105K / $128K total comp. Starling's Engine mission is my top choice, but I need the package to be competitive. Can we increase the base to £98K / $120K and add an enhanced options grant to close the gap?"

4. **Regional Parity Lever (Cardiff/Southampton):** "My contributions to Engine generate the same enterprise revenue whether I'm in London or Cardiff. I'm asking for the regional discount to be narrowed from 15% to 8%, bringing my Cardiff base to £83K / $101K. The code I write in Cardiff ships to the same global enterprise customers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £98K / $120K base with £22K / $27K annual options and £14K / $17K bonus for total comp of £134K / $164K. In Cardiff, push for £83K / $101K base (narrowing the gap to 8%). In Southampton, target £86K / $105K. Lead with the Engine ARR attribution argument -- you are building the product that generates $136M in enterprise SaaS revenue. At the Senior level, pre-IPO options are your strongest lever; push for the maximum 4-year grant and negotiate the cliff terms. Always reference Thought Machine and 10x Banking as direct BaaS competitor benchmarks.
