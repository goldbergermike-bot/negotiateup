#### Why This Is the Signature Role

The Engine SaaS Platform Engineer is the role that defines Starling Bank's future. While Starling began as a consumer challenger bank, its growth trajectory and IPO valuation are increasingly tied to Engine -- the Banking-as-a-Service platform that licenses Starling's technology stack to financial institutions globally. The Engine SaaS Platform Engineer is the person who builds that platform. Not a feature within it. Not a service that supports it. The platform itself.

This role exists at the nexus of everything that makes Starling unique: cloud-native banking infrastructure, multi-tenant SaaS architecture, financial regulatory compliance, enterprise API design, and revenue-generating platform engineering. It is the purest expression of the "SaaS Product Architect" framing that should permeate every negotiation with Starling. If every Starling engineer should think of themselves as a SaaS Product Architect, the Engine SaaS Platform Engineer is the archetype.

CEO Raman Bhatia has staked Starling's growth strategy on Engine reaching $136M ARR. The engineers building Engine's core platform are not just contributing to that target -- they are the target. Without them, Engine is a PowerPoint deck, not a product. This role commands the highest compensation at Starling outside of pure leadership positions because it carries the highest direct impact on enterprise revenue.

#### Negotiation DNA

The Engine SaaS Platform Engineer operates at the intersection of Staff-level individual contribution and platform product ownership. You are building the core multi-tenant infrastructure, the enterprise API layer, the tenant provisioning and isolation systems, the compliance automation framework, and the deployment architecture that makes Engine a licensable product. Every line of code you write has a direct, measurable impact on whether enterprise financial institutions can successfully run their banking operations on Starling's technology.

Frame yourself as a Platform Product Architect who builds enterprise SaaS revenue. You are not a bank employee -- you are a SaaS product builder. The closest analogues to your role are not found in banking. They are found at companies like Stripe (where Platform Engineers build the infrastructure that processes billions in payments), Snowflake (where Platform Engineers build the multi-tenant data infrastructure), and Twilio (where Platform Engineers build the communications APIs that enterprises depend on). Your compensation should be benchmarked against these companies, not against bank technology departments.

The scarcity of engineers who can build enterprise-grade, multi-tenant, regulated banking infrastructure is extreme. The global talent pool for this intersection -- deep platform engineering expertise, financial services domain knowledge, multi-tenancy at scale, and enterprise SaaS product orientation -- numbers in the low hundreds. Thought Machine, 10x Banking, Mambu, Temenos, and every major cloud provider's financial services practice are all competing for this exact profile. You are in one of the strongest negotiating positions in UK tech.

Starling's financial position supports aggressive compensation for this role. The company has been profitable since 2022 and is preparing for an IPO expected in 2026-2027. The Engine platform is the centrepiece of the IPO narrative. The engineers building Engine are, in a very real sense, building the asset that will be valued by public market investors. Pre-IPO options for this role carry genuine, credible upside -- and you should negotiate aggressively for a maximum grant.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

This section is the core of your negotiation strategy. The Engine SaaS Platform Engineer is the purest embodiment of the "SaaS Product Architect" premium -- you literally build the SaaS product. Every argument in this section should be deployed in your compensation negotiations.

- **You Are the Platform Product:** Other Starling engineers build features on Engine. You build Engine itself. The multi-tenant core, the API gateway, the tenant provisioning system, the compliance automation framework, the deployment orchestration -- this is the product that generates $136M ARR. Your code is not a contribution to revenue; it is the revenue-generating asset. At Stripe, Platform Engineers who build the core infrastructure earn £130K-£175K / $159K-$214K base. At Snowflake, Platform Engineers building multi-tenant data infrastructure earn £125K-£160K / $153K-$195K. Your compensation should anchor to these benchmarks, not to bank engineering pay bands. The premium over traditional bank tech at this level is £30K-£50K / $37K-$61K -- a 25-35% uplift reflecting the fundamental difference between building a SaaS product and maintaining internal banking systems.

- **Multi-Tenant BaaS Architecture Is the Hardest Problem in Fintech:** Building a platform that allows multiple financial institutions to run their banking operations on shared infrastructure -- with strict data isolation, per-tenant configuration, regulatory compliance across jurisdictions, and enterprise SLAs -- is one of the most complex engineering challenges in the technology industry. This is not a CRUD application with a banking licence. This is systems-level engineering on par with building a cloud provider's core infrastructure. The complexity premium alone justifies base compensation at the £125K-£155K / $153K-$189K range. When hiring managers say "our internal bands don't go that high," respond: "Then your internal bands are benchmarked to the wrong industry. This role builds an enterprise SaaS product. The benchmark is SaaS platform engineering, not bank IT."

- **Pre-IPO Options Are Maximally Valuable for Platform Builders:** As the engineer building Engine's core platform, your work directly determines Starling's IPO valuation. The sophistication, reliability, and scalability of the Engine platform is the primary asset that institutional investors will evaluate. Your options grant should reflect this. At the Engine SaaS Platform Engineer level, push for £38K / $46K per year over 4 years, totalling £152K / $185K. This is the largest options grant outside the C-suite, and it is justified because you are building the asset that gets valued at IPO. With Starling profitable since 2022 and IPO expected 2026-2027, these options have a credible, near-term path to liquidity. Negotiate for an accelerated vesting clause tied to IPO -- if Starling IPOs within your vesting period, all unvested options should accelerate. This protects your equity in the most likely exit scenario.

- **The BaaS Platform Engineer Talent War Is Winner-Take-All:** There are perhaps 200-300 engineers globally who can build enterprise-grade, multi-tenant banking-as-a-service platforms. Thought Machine has raised over $500M and competes aggressively for this talent. 10x Banking, backed by JPMorgan, is hiring from the same pool. Mambu has expanded its engineering team in Berlin, Bucharest, and Amsterdam. Temenos, the legacy player, is modernising its platform and poaching cloud-native engineers. AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft all have financial services platform teams targeting the same candidates. You are in a seller's market within a seller's market. Use this relentlessly: "The number of engineers who can build what Engine needs is extremely small, and every major BaaS competitor and cloud provider is hiring from the same pool. My compensation needs to reflect that I am choosing Starling over all of those alternatives."

#### Detailed Compensation Architecture

Beyond the headline numbers, the Engine SaaS Platform Engineer should negotiate a comprehensive compensation architecture:

**Base Salary Negotiation:**
- London floor: £125K / $153K. No offer below this should be considered. The market for Platform Engineers building enterprise SaaS in regulated industries starts here.
- London target: £145K-£155K / $177K-$189K. This is the range that reflects the true market value of this role when benchmarked against Stripe, Snowflake, and Thought Machine.
- Cardiff: £106K-£132K / $130K-$161K. Push hard to narrow the regional discount to 8-10% rather than the standard 15%. Your platform code ships globally regardless of where you sit.
- Southampton: £110K-£136K / $134K-$166K. Same regional parity argument as Cardiff.

**Options Negotiation:**
- Total 4-year grant target: £120K-£152K / $146K-$185K (£30K-£38K / $37K-$46K per year).
- Negotiate for a 1-year cliff with monthly vesting thereafter. Quarterly vesting is acceptable but monthly is preferred.
- Request an IPO acceleration clause: upon IPO, all unvested options accelerate immediately. This is standard at pre-IPO SaaS companies and protects your equity.
- Request a refresh grant mechanism: annual option refreshers to prevent equity dilution as you vest.
- If Starling pushes back on grant size, counter: "This role builds the asset that will be valued at IPO. The options grant should reflect the direct link between my work and Starling's enterprise value."

**Bonus Negotiation:**
- Target 12-15% of base salary, partially tied to Engine ARR milestones.
- Negotiate for a revenue-linked bonus component: a percentage of Engine ARR growth attributed to platform capabilities you deliver.
- Annual bonus target in London: £18K-£22K / $22K-$27K.

#### Global Levers

1. **Platform = Product = Revenue Lever:** "I build the Engine platform itself -- the multi-tenant core, the API layer, the tenant provisioning system. This is the product that generates $136M ARR. At Stripe, a Platform Engineer building comparable core infrastructure earns £140K-£175K / $171K-$214K base. At Thought Machine, a Staff Platform Engineer earns £130K-£160K / $159K-$195K. I'm targeting £155K / $189K base because I am building the revenue-generating asset, not a feature within it."

2. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximisation Lever:** "My platform work directly determines Starling's IPO valuation. The Engine platform is the asset institutional investors will evaluate. I'm seeking a 4-year options grant of £152K / $185K with an IPO acceleration clause. This aligns my incentives with Starling's most important milestone and reflects the direct link between my engineering output and enterprise value creation."

3. **Talent Scarcity Escalation Lever:** "I have competing offers from [Thought Machine/10x Banking/Stripe/AWS Financial Services]. The global pool of engineers who can build multi-tenant, enterprise-grade banking-as-a-service platforms numbers in the low hundreds. I'm choosing between Starling and these alternatives, and I need total comp of £215K / $262K to make that choice. This includes £155K / $189K base, £38K / $46K annual options, and £22K / $27K bonus."

4. **BaaS Market Positioning Lever:** "The global BaaS market is projected to reach $12.2B by 2028. Engine is Starling's bet on capturing a significant share of that market. I am the engineer who builds the platform that captures that market share. My compensation should reflect the strategic importance of this role -- not what a bank pays for internal infrastructure. I'm targeting the top of the band at £155K / $189K base with maximum options."

5. **Regional Parity Challenge Lever (Cardiff/Southampton):** "At the Platform Engineer level, my impact is entirely location-independent. The Engine platform I build in Cardiff serves the same global enterprise clients as code written in London. I'm asking for no more than an 8% regional adjustment, bringing my Cardiff base to £132K / $161K and Southampton to £136K / $166K. The 15% standard discount is inappropriate for a role where the output is a global SaaS product."

6. **Counter-Offer Anchoring Lever:** "I want to be transparent about where I am in my process. I have an offer from [Thought Machine/10x Banking] at £195K / $238K total comp and a competing package from [Stripe/AWS] at £210K / $256K. Starling's Engine mission is my first choice because I want to build the core platform, not work on a sub-team. But I need the total comp to be competitive. Can we reach £215K / $262K with a combination of base, options, and bonus adjustments?"

#### Advanced Negotiation Tactics for the Signature Role

**Tactic 1: The IPO Timeline Anchor**
Starling's IPO is expected in 2026-2027. This creates a narrow window where pre-IPO options are available. Use this urgency: "I recognise that pre-IPO options are a time-limited opportunity. In 12-18 months, Starling will be public and options won't be available at this strike price. I want to maximise my equity position now, during this window. I'm seeking the maximum grant of £38K / $46K per year."

**Tactic 2: The Platform Dependency Argument**
Engine's entire product roadmap depends on the platform you build. Every feature team, every integration, every enterprise client deployment runs on your infrastructure. This creates enormous leverage: "Every other team's output depends on the platform I build. If the platform is slow, unreliable, or poorly architected, nothing else works. My compensation should reflect this organisational dependency."

**Tactic 3: The Competitive Intelligence Play**
Research Thought Machine's, 10x Banking's, and Mambu's engineering compensation before your negotiation. Even recruiter conversations and Blind posts provide useful data points. Present this intelligence: "Based on my research and conversations, Platform Engineers at BaaS competitors earn £140K-£170K base in London. I'd like Starling's offer to be in the top quartile of that range."

**Tactic 4: The Total Cost of Loss Calculation**
If Starling loses you to a competitor, the cost is not just the salary differential. It is 6-12 months of delayed Engine platform development, potentially missed enterprise client commitments, and degraded IPO narrative. Quantify this: "A 6-month platform engineering vacancy costs far more than the £20K-£30K difference between a mid-band and top-band offer. The economics strongly favour investing in retention-grade compensation upfront."

**Tactic 5: The Revenue Attribution Model**
Calculate the revenue that Engine platform capabilities enable: "If Engine signs 10 enterprise clients at £1M-£5M annual licence fees, my platform work enables £10M-£50M in ARR. The platform team's compensation is less than 5% of the revenue it generates. There is enormous headroom to increase platform engineer pay while maintaining healthy unit economics."

#### Long-Form Negotiation Script

Here is a complete negotiation script for the initial compensation discussion:

"Thank you for the offer. I'm genuinely excited about the Engine Platform Engineer role -- building the core BaaS infrastructure is exactly the kind of work I want to do. I want to discuss the compensation package to make sure it reflects the scope and impact of this role.

First, on base salary: the current offer of [£X] is benchmarked, I suspect, against internal engineering bands. But this role isn't a standard engineering position. I'm building the Engine platform -- the product that generates enterprise revenue for Starling. The closest benchmarks are Platform Engineers at Stripe, Thought Machine, and Snowflake, where base salaries for this level of impact range from £130K to £170K in London. I'd like to target £155K / $189K base.

Second, on options: Starling is in a unique pre-IPO window where equity is maximally valuable. My platform work will directly determine the Engine's capability and reliability, which in turn drives Starling's IPO valuation. I'd like a 4-year grant of £152K / $185K total, with an IPO acceleration clause that vests all remaining options upon listing. This aligns my incentives perfectly with Starling's most important milestone.

Third, on bonus: given that my platform work directly enables Engine's ARR, I'd like a bonus structure that includes a revenue-linked component. A target of 12-15% of base, with half tied to Engine ARR milestones, would align my incentives with the business outcomes I'm building toward.

I want to be transparent: I have competing offers from [competitor names] in the £195K-£210K total comp range. Starling is my first choice because I want to build the core Engine platform, not work on a peripheral team. But I need the total comp to be competitive at £215K / $262K. Can we work together to get there?"

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £155K / $189K base with £38K / $46K annual options (including IPO acceleration clause) and £22K / $27K bonus for total comp of £215K / $262K. In Cardiff, push for £132K / $161K base (arguing for an 8% maximum regional discount rather than 15%). In Southampton, target £136K / $166K. This is the Signature Role -- the purest expression of the SaaS Product Architect premium. Lead with the platform-as-product argument: you build the asset that generates $136M ARR and that will be valued at IPO. Your options negotiation should be the centrepiece of the conversation -- push for the maximum grant with IPO acceleration. Reference Stripe, Thought Machine, and Snowflake Platform Engineer benchmarks. Use the talent scarcity argument relentlessly: the global pool of engineers who can build enterprise-grade, multi-tenant BaaS platforms is measured in the low hundreds, and every competitor is hiring from it. Never accept bank-benchmarked pay bands -- you build SaaS products, not bank IT systems.
