#### Negotiation DNA

Starling Bank is not a traditional bank hiring technologists -- it is a technology company that holds a banking licence. As a Software Engineer, you are building the Starling Engine, an enterprise Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform targeting $136M ARR. This is not legacy COBOL maintenance or internal tooling for branch operations. You are architecting cloud-native microservices that are licensed to financial institutions globally.

Frame every conversation around the fact that you are a SaaS Product Architect. Your code ships as a product to external enterprise customers, not just internal banking operations. This distinction matters because it places your compensation squarely in the tech-industry bracket rather than the financial-services-IT bracket. Starling's profitable status since 2022 and imminent IPO (expected 2026-2027) mean the company can afford tech-competitive packages, and pre-IPO options carry genuine upside.

When negotiating with Starling, reference that CEO Raman Bhatia has publicly committed to Engine as the company's growth engine. Every line of code you write contributes directly to a $136M ARR enterprise SaaS product. You are not a cost centre -- you are a revenue generator.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **Revenue-Generating Code, Not Cost-Centre IT:** Every feature you build for Engine is licensed to external financial institutions globally. Starling Engine targets $136M ARR, making your work directly attributable to enterprise SaaS revenue. This justifies base salaries 15-25% above traditional bank tech roles -- an uplift of £8K-£17K / $10K-$21K at the Software Engineer level.

- **Enterprise SaaS Skill Set Commands Enterprise SaaS Pay:** You are building multi-tenant, API-first, cloud-native banking infrastructure. These are the same skills valued at Stripe, Adyen, and Plaid. Frame yourself as a "SaaS Product Architect" in negotiations, not a "bank developer." This reframing alone can shift the offer band from financial-services-IT (£45K-£60K) to tech-industry (£55K-£78K).

- **Pre-IPO Optionality Is Real Compensation:** Starling's profitable trajectory and expected 2026-2027 IPO make pre-IPO options a tangible component of your package. At the Software Engineer level, a 4-year options grant of £8K-£15K / $10K-$18K per year could multiply significantly at IPO. Negotiate for a larger initial grant -- this is the cheapest equity Starling will ever issue.

- **BaaS Market Positioning Unlocks Premium Talent Budgets:** The global BaaS market is projected to reach $12.2B by 2028. Starling is positioning Engine as a primary revenue driver alongside its consumer bank. When hiring managers cite "bank pay bands," counter with: "Engine is a SaaS product competing with Thought Machine, Mambu, and 10x Banking for engineering talent. The comp should reflect that."

#### Global Levers

1. **Engine Revenue Attribution Lever:** "My work directly contributes to Engine's $136M ARR target. At Thought Machine or 10x Banking, a Software Engineer building equivalent BaaS infrastructure earns £65K-£85K / $79K-$104K base. I'd like the offer to reflect that I'm building a revenue-generating SaaS product, not internal bank tooling. I'm targeting £68K / $83K base."

2. **Pre-IPO Options Uplift Lever:** "Given Starling's expected IPO in 2026-2027 and the company's profitability since 2022, I'd like to discuss an enhanced options package. The current grant of £8K/year over 4 years is below what pre-IPO fintechs like Monzo offered at a similar stage. I'm seeking £15K / $18K per year in options, vesting over 4 years."

3. **Regional Arbitrage Lever (Cardiff/Southampton):** "I understand that Cardiff and Southampton roles are benchmarked 12-15% below London. However, my Engine contributions generate the same enterprise revenue regardless of my location. I'd like to negotiate the regional discount down to 5-8%, bringing my Cardiff base to £58K / $71K rather than £47K / $57K."

4. **Counter-Offer Escalation Lever:** "I have a competing offer from [Monzo/Revolut/Wise] at £72K / $88K base for a comparable role. Starling's Engine mission is genuinely exciting to me, but I need the total compensation to be competitive. Can we close the gap with a combination of base increase to £68K / $83K and an enhanced options grant?"

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target the top of band at £68K / $83K base with £15K / $18K annual options and £8K / $10K bonus for a total comp of £91K / $111K. In Cardiff, push for £58K / $71K base (narrowing the regional discount to 8%). In Southampton, target £60K / $73K base. Always lead with Engine revenue attribution -- you are a SaaS Product Architect building a $136M ARR platform, not a junior bank developer. Pre-IPO options are your highest-leverage negotiation chip; push for the maximum grant with a 1-year cliff.
