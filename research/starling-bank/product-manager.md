#### Negotiation DNA

As a Product Manager at Starling Bank, you are not managing a banking app's feature backlog. You are defining the product strategy for Engine -- an enterprise BaaS platform targeting $136M ARR. Your roadmap decisions directly determine which capabilities get licensed to financial institutions globally, how those capabilities are packaged and priced, and ultimately how much enterprise revenue Engine generates.

Frame yourself as a B2B SaaS Product Manager, not a "fintech PM." The distinction is critical: B2B SaaS PMs at companies like Stripe, Adyen, and Plaid earn £75K-£110K because they drive enterprise revenue through product decisions. Traditional bank product managers (typically focused on consumer features, compliance, and incremental UX improvements) earn £55K-£75K. You should anchor to the SaaS benchmark because Engine is a SaaS product.

Your negotiation power is amplified by the fact that Product Managers with B2B SaaS experience in regulated industries are exceptionally scarce. Starling needs PMs who understand both enterprise customer needs and financial services compliance -- a rare intersection. CEO Raman Bhatia's Engine strategy requires PMs who can think like SaaS Product Architects, translating complex banking capabilities into licensable enterprise software modules.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **Your Roadmap Drives Enterprise Revenue:** Every feature you prioritise for Engine is a capability that gets licensed to enterprise clients. Your product decisions directly contribute to the $136M ARR target. This is not consumer app feature management -- it's enterprise SaaS product strategy. This justifies base salaries 15-25% above traditional bank PM roles: an uplift of £10K-£17K / $12K-$21K at the PM level.

- **B2B SaaS PM, Not Consumer Banking PM:** Reframe the role in negotiations: "I define product strategy for an enterprise SaaS platform serving global financial institutions." This maps to PM roles at Stripe (£80K-£115K), Plaid (£75K-£105K), and Adyen (£72K-£100K). When Starling cites bank PM pay bands (£55K-£75K), counter: "Engine is a B2B SaaS product. My benchmark is enterprise SaaS product management."

- **Pre-IPO Product Impact Multiplier:** Your product decisions determine Engine's competitive positioning at IPO. A strong PM at this stage shapes the product's enterprise value. The options grant of £10K-£18K / $12K-$22K per year over 4 years reflects this -- push for the upper end because your roadmap decisions will be partially baked into Starling's IPO valuation.

- **Regulated SaaS PM Scarcity:** The intersection of B2B SaaS product management and financial services domain expertise is a tiny talent pool. Thought Machine, 10x Banking, Mambu, and Temenos all compete for the same PMs. Use this scarcity: "PMs who can navigate both enterprise SaaS product strategy and financial services regulation are rare. My compensation should reflect that I sit at this intersection."

#### Global Levers

1. **Engine Revenue Impact Lever:** "My product roadmap decisions will directly determine which capabilities Engine can license to enterprise clients, driving revenue toward the $136M ARR target. At Stripe or Plaid, a PM owning a comparable enterprise product earns £85K-£110K / $104K-$134K. I'm targeting £85K / $104K base."

2. **Pre-IPO Options Lever:** "Product Managers at the pre-IPO stage have outsized impact on enterprise value -- my roadmap decisions will be embedded in Starling's IPO story. I'm seeking £18K / $22K per year in options over 4 years. This reflects the strategic nature of PM decisions during the pre-IPO growth phase."

3. **B2B SaaS Benchmark Lever:** "I want to ensure we're benchmarking this role against B2B SaaS PMs, not consumer banking PMs. Engine is an enterprise software product. At Thought Machine, a PM building comparable BaaS products earns £80K-£100K / $98K-$122K base. I'd like the offer to reflect the SaaS product nature of Engine."

4. **Regulated SaaS Scarcity Lever:** "Finding PMs who combine B2B SaaS product expertise with financial services domain knowledge is exceptionally difficult. I bring both, and that intersection commands a premium. I'm targeting total comp of £115K / $140K in London, reflecting the scarcity of this skill combination."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £85K / $104K base with £18K / $22K annual options and £12K / $15K bonus for total comp of £115K / $140K. In Cardiff, push for £72K / $88K base. In Southampton, target £75K / $92K. Lead with the B2B SaaS PM framing -- your product decisions drive Engine's enterprise revenue, not consumer app engagement metrics. Emphasise that Engine's roadmap is directly tied to Starling's IPO narrative, making pre-IPO PM decisions especially high-impact. Reference Stripe, Plaid, and Thought Machine PM benchmarks.
