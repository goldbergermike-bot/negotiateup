#### Negotiation DNA

As a DevOps Engineer at Starling Bank, you build and maintain the infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and operational reliability for Engine -- a multi-tenant BaaS platform targeting $136M ARR. You are not managing internal banking servers. You are building SaaS-grade infrastructure that must serve multiple enterprise financial institution clients simultaneously with regulated-industry uptime and security requirements.

Frame yourself as a SaaS Platform Infrastructure Engineer. The infrastructure you build enables Engine to scale across enterprise clients, deploy continuously, and maintain the reliability standards that financial institutions demand. This is the same calibre of work performed by DevOps engineers at Stripe, Cloudflare, and Datadog -- and your compensation should reflect that. Traditional bank infrastructure roles pay £48K-£65K; the tech-industry benchmark is £60K-£85K because you are operating a multi-tenant SaaS product, not an internal banking system.

Engine's multi-tenant architecture creates unique DevOps challenges: client data isolation, per-tenant scaling, compliance-aware deployment pipelines, and enterprise SLA management. These challenges are substantially more complex than single-tenant internal banking infrastructure. CEO Raman Bhatia's commitment to Engine means DevOps Engineers who can reliably operate multi-tenant financial infrastructure are critical hires.

#### Engine — The SaaS Product Architect Premium

- **Multi-Tenant Infrastructure = Product Infrastructure:** The infrastructure you build is Engine's product infrastructure. Every deployment pipeline, every scaling configuration, every monitoring system you create serves external enterprise clients, not just internal teams. This multi-tenant SaaS infrastructure work justifies base salaries 15-20% above traditional bank DevOps roles: an uplift of £9K-£15K / $11K-$18K at the DevOps Engineer level.

- **SaaS Platform Infrastructure Engineer, Not Bank Ops:** Reframe the role: "I build and operate multi-tenant cloud infrastructure for an enterprise SaaS platform serving global financial institutions." This maps to DevOps roles at Stripe (£70K-£95K), Cloudflare (£65K-£90K), and Datadog (£65K-£88K). When Starling cites bank infrastructure pay bands, counter: "Engine is a multi-tenant SaaS product. I'm operating enterprise software infrastructure, not internal banking systems."

- **Pre-IPO Infrastructure Reliability Premium:** Engine's reliability is non-negotiable -- financial institutions cannot tolerate downtime. The infrastructure you build underpins the $136M ARR target. Your options grant of £9K-£16K / $11K-$20K per year over 4 years reflects that Engine's enterprise value depends on the operational reliability you deliver.

- **Regulated Multi-Tenant DevOps Scarcity:** DevOps Engineers who can operate multi-tenant infrastructure under financial services regulatory constraints (FCA, PRA, data sovereignty requirements) are rare. The intersection of cloud-native DevOps, multi-tenancy expertise, and financial regulation knowledge commands a scarcity premium: "Operating SaaS infrastructure that must satisfy both enterprise SLA requirements and financial services regulation is an exceptionally rare skill set."

#### Global Levers

1. **Multi-Tenant Infrastructure Lever:** "I'll be building and operating the multi-tenant infrastructure that enables Engine to serve enterprise clients at scale, directly supporting the $136M ARR target. At Stripe or Cloudflare, a DevOps Engineer building comparable SaaS infrastructure earns £70K-£90K / $85K-$110K. I'm targeting £74K / $90K base."

2. **Pre-IPO Reliability Lever:** "Engine's enterprise value depends on infrastructure reliability. A single significant outage could impact enterprise client retention and ARR. I'd like an options grant of £16K / $20K per year over 4 years, reflecting the critical role infrastructure plays in Engine's success."

3. **Regulated Multi-Tenant Scarcity Lever:** "DevOps Engineers who can operate multi-tenant SaaS infrastructure under financial services regulation are extremely scarce. I bring this intersection and expect compensation that reflects it -- targeting total comp of £100K / $122K in London."

4. **On-Call and Incident Response Lever:** "Given Engine's enterprise SLA requirements, this role involves significant on-call responsibility for a regulated multi-tenant platform. I'd like the base to reflect the on-call burden at £74K / $90K, with a structured on-call allowance or compensatory time off."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** In London, target £74K / $90K base with £16K / $20K annual options and £10K / $12K bonus for total comp of £100K / $122K. In Cardiff, push for £63K / $77K base. In Southampton, target £65K / $79K. Lead with the multi-tenant SaaS infrastructure argument -- you operate the platform that Engine's enterprise clients depend on. Emphasise the on-call burden and regulated-industry reliability requirements. Reference Stripe, Cloudflare, and Datadog DevOps benchmarks as primary comparators.
