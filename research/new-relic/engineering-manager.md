## Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at New Relic own the intersection of people, process, and product delivery. Following the 2023 take-private by TPG and Francisco Partners, EMs became critical to executing the PE-backed transformation roadmap — driving execution velocity, retaining top talent, and scaling teams that deliver AI-powered observability features. Your compensation package will lean heavily on options (not RSUs), reflecting the private company structure. The negotiation dynamic favors candidates who can demonstrate a track record of shipping high-impact features on time while building and retaining high-performing teams. New Relic's focus on the Innovation Dividend means EMs who can quantify their teams' deployment velocity and productivity gains hold significant leverage.

**Level Mapping:** Engineering Manager at New Relic maps to M1/M2 (first-line/second-line manager) industry-wide. Equivalent titles include SDM (Amazon), M1 (Meta), L6-M (Google), and Engineering Manager (Datadog/Elastic).

### New Relic Innovation Dividend & Full-Stack AI Lever

On **Feb 3, 2026**, New Relic published its **AI Impact Report**, demonstrating that engineering teams using New Relic AI achieve **80%** higher shipping frequency — a **5X** deployment multiplier. New Relic brands this the **Innovation Dividend**, positioning observability as a direct accelerator of engineering velocity rather than a cost of doing business.

As an Engineering Manager, you are the force multiplier behind the **Full-Stack AI** vision. You build the teams, set the processes, and create the environments where the 5X deployment multiplier becomes reality. Your negotiation should emphasize that the Innovation Dividend doesn't happen without excellent engineering management — every percentage point of that 80% improvement flows through the teams you lead.

**How to deploy this lever in negotiation:**

1. **The Team Velocity Lever**
> "Your AI Impact Report from Feb 3, 2026, showed 80% higher shipping frequency. As an EM, I'm the one who translates that potential into actual team output. In my current role, I've driven my team to a 3X improvement in deployment frequency — I'll bring that same operational discipline to deliver the Innovation Dividend at New Relic."

2. **The Talent Retention Lever**
> "In a private company, EM-level retention is critical — you can't afford to re-hire and re-ramp management. I need a competitive base and meaningful options to commit to a 4-year vesting schedule. 50,000 options with a guaranteed annual refresh ensures I'm aligned with the long-term value creation."

3. **The Full-Stack AI Team Builder Lever**
> "I specialize in building Full-Stack AI teams — engineers who can work across the entire observability and ML stack. That's exactly the profile you need to deliver the 5X deployment multiplier. My ability to recruit and retain this caliber of talent is worth a premium."

4. **The PE Execution Lever**
> "I have direct experience leading engineering teams through PE-backed transformations. I know how to balance velocity, quality, and cost — the trifecta that drives the Innovation Dividend. My competing offer from [company] values that at $360,000 total comp with liquid equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $238,000 base (SF) / $212,000 (Portland) / £150,000 (London) with 50,000 options. Reference a competing offer at $380,000 total comp from Datadog or GitLab with liquid RSUs. Push for a $40,000 signing bonus and guaranteed annual refresh of 8,000 options. Accept-at floor: $210,000 base (SF) with 35,000 options and $20,000 signing bonus. If total comp is constrained, negotiate for a management-level retention bonus at the 2-year mark or early exercise provisions on options.
