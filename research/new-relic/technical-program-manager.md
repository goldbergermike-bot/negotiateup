## Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at New Relic orchestrate the cross-functional programs that turn strategy into shipped product. Since the 2023 acquisition by TPG and Francisco Partners, TPMs have become the execution backbone of the company — coordinating engineering, product, design, and data science teams to deliver on aggressive timelines set by the PE sponsors. Compensation includes stock options (not RSUs) with a 4-year vesting schedule. TPMs who can manage complex, multi-team programs involving AI/ML features, platform migrations, and enterprise-scale reliability improvements are in high demand. Your negotiation leverage comes from demonstrating that you are the operational force multiplier who ensures programs ship on time, at quality, and within budget — the direct enabler of the Innovation Dividend.

**Level Mapping:** Technical Program Manager at New Relic maps to TPM/Sr TPM across the industry. Equivalent titles include TPM II/Sr (Amazon), Technical Program Manager (Meta/Google), and Program Manager (Datadog/Microsoft).

### New Relic Innovation Dividend & Full-Stack AI Lever

On **Feb 3, 2026**, New Relic released its **AI Impact Report** showing that teams using New Relic AI achieve **80%** higher shipping frequency — a **5X** deployment multiplier. New Relic brands this as the **Innovation Dividend**, positioning AI-powered observability as a direct accelerator of engineering productivity and deployment velocity.

As a Technical Program Manager, you are the orchestrator of the **Full-Stack AI** program portfolio. The Innovation Dividend doesn't materialize spontaneously — it requires coordinated execution across multiple engineering teams, clear milestone tracking, and rigorous dependency management. The 80% shipping frequency improvement and 5X deployment multiplier documented in the AI Impact Report are program outcomes: they happened because someone drove the execution. Your negotiation should position you as the TPM who ensures the next wave of Innovation Dividend features ships on schedule.

**How to deploy this lever in negotiation:**

1. **The Execution Velocity Lever**
> "Your AI Impact Report from Feb 3, 2026, showed 80% higher shipping frequency. That metric is a program management outcome — it requires coordinated execution across engineering, data science, and product teams. I've delivered programs of similar complexity at [previous company], consistently hitting milestones that drove the Innovation Dividend for our customers."

2. **The Cross-Functional Orchestration Lever**
> "The Full-Stack AI vision requires a TPM who can coordinate across the entire technology stack — from ML model development to platform deployment to customer rollout. I bring cross-functional program management experience that directly enables the 5X deployment multiplier. My competing offer from [Amazon/Google] reflects the market premium for this skill set."

3. **The PE Execution Discipline Lever**
> "In a PE-backed environment, execution discipline directly impacts enterprise value. I have experience managing programs in high-accountability environments where milestones translate directly to business outcomes. The Innovation Dividend requires someone who can hold cross-functional teams to aggressive timelines while maintaining quality."

4. **The Program Scale Lever**
> "I've managed programs with $[X]M budgets and [X] engineering teams. At New Relic, I'll be the one who ensures the AI features that drove the 80% shipping frequency improvement are delivered on time and at scale. That operational ownership warrants 25,000 options and a compensation package that reflects the program's strategic importance."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $200,000 base (SF) / $182,000 (Portland) / £125,000 (London) with 25,000 options. Reference a competing offer at $305,000 total comp from Amazon or Google with liquid RSUs. Push for a $28,000 signing bonus and guaranteed annual refresh of 4,500 options. Accept-at floor: $175,000 base (SF) with 17,000 options and $15,000 signing bonus. If comp is constrained, negotiate for a program delivery bonus structure tied to key milestones or accelerated vesting on the first 25% of options.
