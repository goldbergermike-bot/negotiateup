This is Coupang's signature engineering role. Rocket Delivery Engineers build the systems that power Coupang's legendary "Rocket Delivery" — the logistics technology that enables same-day and next-day delivery for virtually every order in South Korea. Coupang's Rocket Delivery is the gold standard of e-commerce fulfillment: order by midnight, receive by 7 AM. This speed is powered by sophisticated routing algorithms, warehouse automation, fleet management systems, and real-time optimization that coordinate tens of thousands of deliveries daily. The 10-15% logistics premium reflects the specialized expertise in real-time logistics optimization, warehouse automation, and last-mile delivery systems. Coupang's $40B market cap and Mountain View engineering office mean competitive US comp with CPNG RSUs that participate in Korean e-commerce growth.
