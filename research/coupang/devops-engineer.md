Coupang DevOps Engineers build and maintain infrastructure supporting Korea's dominant e-commerce platform — marketplace, logistics systems, payment processing, and real-time delivery tracking. Coupang's infrastructure must handle peak commerce events (Korean holidays, sales events) while maintaining the reliability required for Rocket Delivery's same-day promise. The infrastructure spans cloud systems, warehouse automation infrastructure, and fleet management systems. [Source: Coupang DevOps Comp 2026]
