**Negotiation DNA**

Coupang Software Engineers build the technology powering South Korea's dominant e-commerce platform. Coupang is often called "the Amazon of Korea" but its logistics capabilities (Rocket Delivery) actually surpass Amazon in speed. The Mountain View engineering office competes directly with Google, Meta, and other Bay Area employers for talent, and Coupang pays competitively. CPNG RSUs ($40B market cap) provide equity in a company with strong revenue growth. The 10-15% target bonus adds meaningful guaranteed comp. Coupang's engineering challenges span marketplace, payments (Coupang Pay), logistics, food delivery (Coupang Eats), and streaming (Coupang Play). [Source: Coupang SWE Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Coupang Software Engineer = Google L3 = Meta E3 = Amazon SDE-I = Apple ICT2

4. **Sign-On Bonus:** "I'm requesting a $20K-$30K sign-on bonus to bridge first-year equity uncertainty."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "Coupang's engineering challenges and Mountain View office are compelling. I'm targeting $200K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $208K. I have a [Google/Amazon] offer at $[X]." Accept if RSUs exceed $175K/4yr with a sign-on bonus.
