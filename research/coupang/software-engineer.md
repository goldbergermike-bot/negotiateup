### Software Engineer | Coupang Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive US Comp | CPNG RSUs ($40B Market Cap) | Korean E-Commerce Leader | Mountain View Office

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View | $155K-$215K | $80K-$230K | 10-15% | $200K-$335K |
| Seattle | $150K-$210K | $75K-$220K | 10-15% | $192K-$322K |
| Seoul | KRW equivalent (~60-70% of US) | CPNG RSUs | 10-15% | Adjusted for market |

**Negotiation DNA**

Coupang Software Engineers build the technology powering South Korea's dominant e-commerce platform. Coupang is often called "the Amazon of Korea" but its logistics capabilities (Rocket Delivery) actually surpass Amazon in speed. The Mountain View engineering office competes directly with Google, Meta, and other Bay Area employers for talent, and Coupang pays competitively. CPNG RSUs ($40B market cap) provide equity in a company with strong revenue growth. The 10-15% target bonus adds meaningful guaranteed comp. Coupang's engineering challenges span marketplace, payments (Coupang Pay), logistics, food delivery (Coupang Eats), and streaming (Coupang Play). [Source: Coupang SWE Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Coupang Software Engineer = Google L3 = Meta E3 = Amazon SDE-I = Apple ICT2

**Global Levers**

1. **Mountain View Talent Competition:** "Coupang's Mountain View office competes with Google, Meta, and top Bay Area employers. Comp needs to be competitive with these alternatives."
2. **CPNG Growth Equity:** "CPNG at $40B market cap has growth potential. My RSU grant should be sized at $200K+ over 4 years."
3. **Multi-Platform Complexity:** "Coupang spans marketplace, payments, logistics, food delivery, and streaming — broader than most e-commerce companies."
4. **Sign-On Bonus:** "I'm requesting a $20K-$30K sign-on bonus to bridge first-year equity uncertainty."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "Coupang's engineering challenges and Mountain View office are compelling. I'm targeting $200K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $208K. I have a [Google/Amazon] offer at $[X]." Accept if RSUs exceed $175K/4yr with a sign-on bonus.
