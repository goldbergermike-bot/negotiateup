### ML/AI Engineer | Coupang Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive US Comp | CPNG RSUs ($40B Market Cap) | **+5-10% ML PREMIUM** | Korean E-Commerce Leader

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View | $165K-$228K | $95K-$255K | 10-15% | $218K-$365K |
| Seattle | $160K-$220K | $90K-$245K | 10-15% | $208K-$352K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Coupang ML/AI Engineers build models for search ranking, recommendation, demand forecasting, delivery routing, fraud detection, and pricing optimization. ML at Coupang powers both the commerce experience (personalized discovery) and logistics operations (route optimization, demand prediction for inventory positioning). The 5-10% ML premium reflects the scarcity of ML engineers who can optimize across both commerce and logistics domains. [Source: Coupang ML Comp 2026]
