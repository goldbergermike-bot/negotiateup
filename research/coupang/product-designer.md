Coupang Product Designers shape the commerce and delivery experience for Korea's dominant e-commerce platform. Designing for Coupang requires understanding Korean consumer expectations, mobile-first shopping behaviors, and the unique Rocket Delivery tracking experience. Your designs span marketplace shopping, payment flows, delivery tracking, and the expanding Coupang ecosystem (Coupang Eats, Coupang Play). Cross-cultural design skills are valuable as you design for Korean users from a US office. [Source: Coupang Product Design Comp 2026]
