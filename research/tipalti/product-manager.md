**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Tipalti define what gets built on a platform that processes billions in global payments for 4,000+ customers including Twitch, Roblox, GoDaddy, and ZipRecruiter. With $350M+ ARR and a pre-IPO trajectory, every product decision carries outsized weight — you are shaping the roadmap that will be scrutinized by public-market investors. The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report reveals that 78% of finance leaders want AI-driven automation but only 34% trust it enough to deploy it without human oversight. This AI Trust Gap is the defining product challenge at Tipalti: how do you accelerate AI adoption across end-to-end payables automation while maintaining the governance and training frameworks that enterprise customers demand?

As a Product Manager at Tipalti, you are a Trust Architect by definition. Every feature you ship — whether it is AI-powered invoice matching, automated supplier validation, or predictive payment scheduling — must clear the trust bar. Your product decisions directly impact whether Tipalti's customers adopt or resist AI features, making your role a revenue multiplier. The Trust Architect premium for PMs is especially strong because the role requires deep fintech domain knowledge (AP workflows, tax compliance, payment regulations) combined with AI product strategy — a rare intersection.

Tipalti's private status means your equity comes as stock options with a 4-year vesting schedule. At the current ~$4-5B valuation, there is meaningful upside if the company executes on its IPO roadmap. But you should negotiate options aggressively and ensure transparency on strike price, 409A valuation, and dilution projections.

### AI Trust — The Trust Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Trust Product Strategy:** "The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report highlights a massive product opportunity: closing the AI Trust Gap for finance teams. At Tipalti, that means building AI features with governance and training baked into the product experience — not just the backend. I've shipped AI products that increased adoption by 40%+ through Trust Architect design principles — progressive disclosure, explainability layers, human-in-the-loop controls. That product instinct is worth top-of-band comp at $200K-$210K base."

**Lever 2 — Revenue Impact at Scale:** "Tipalti's 4,000+ customers represent a massive adoption surface for AI-driven payables automation. The PM who gets AI trust right will directly drive expansion revenue, reduce churn, and strengthen the IPO narrative. Given the $350M+ ARR base and end-to-end automation positioning, I'd like an options grant of $120K-$150K over four years, reflecting the direct revenue impact of Trust Architect product decisions."

**Lever 3 — Competitive Talent Market:** "PM roles at the intersection of AI and fintech are the most competitive in tech right now. The AI Trust Gap has created a new product specialty — Trust Architect PMs who can translate governance requirements into intuitive product experiences. I'm evaluating offers from Stripe, Bill.com, and public fintechs with liquid equity. To choose a pre-IPO opportunity, I'd need a $25K-$30K signing bonus and $20K annual retention bonus."

**Lever 4 — Pre-IPO Product Narrative:** "The product roadmap I'll own will become a centerpiece of Tipalti's IPO story. Investors will ask: how does Tipalti use AI to differentiate its payables automation? The answer will be the Trust Architect features I ship — AI governance, training tools for finance teams, and explainable automation. That narrative responsibility should be reflected in a 20-25% target bonus and accelerated vesting on a portion of my options grant."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $195,000-$210,000 base in San Mateo, anchoring to Google L5/L6 PM bands and Stripe PM comp. Push for $120,000-$150,000 in options over 4 years. Request a $25,000-$30,000 signing bonus, especially if holding competing offers with liquid equity. Negotiate target bonus to 20-25% of base. Your accept-at floor should be $180,000 base + $80,000 options/4yr + $25,000 bonus = $285,000 total comp. Walk away below $170,000 base unless equity terms include acceleration and the grant exceeds $100,000/4yr.
