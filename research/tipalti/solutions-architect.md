**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Tipalti are the technical bridge between the product and the customer. You design the implementation architecture for enterprise customers adopting Tipalti's end-to-end payables automation platform — integrating with their ERP systems, configuring payment workflows across 196 countries, and ensuring compliance with local regulations. With 4,000+ customers including Twitch, Roblox, GoDaddy, and ZipRecruiter, and $350M+ ARR driving the pre-IPO trajectory, your technical designs directly determine whether customers succeed and expand on the platform. The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report adds a critical new dimension to this role: customers are asking how AI features fit into their payment workflows, and they need a Trust Architect to design solutions that close the AI Trust Gap.

Every enterprise implementation you architect must now account for AI governance and training requirements. When a customer asks, "How does Tipalti's AI decide which payments to flag for review?" you are the person who designs the answer — not just technically, but in a way that builds trust with CFOs, controllers, and compliance teams. The Trust Architect premium for Solutions Architects is driven by the fact that you are the face of AI trust for Tipalti's highest-value customers.

Solutions Architect comp at Tipalti includes a meaningful variable component tied to customer success metrics, implementation milestones, or expansion revenue. Negotiate both the base and the variable targets, and ensure the options grant reflects the direct revenue impact of your implementations. At Tipalti's ~$4-5B valuation, pre-IPO equity is a significant part of your long-term comp story.

### AI Trust — The Trust Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Customer-Facing AI Trust Authority:** "The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report shows that enterprise finance teams demand Trust Architect-level guidance when adopting AI-driven automation. As a Solutions Architect at Tipalti, I'll be the person who designs AI governance frameworks for your largest customers — explaining how AI payment decisions work, building confidence in automated compliance, and training finance teams to trust the platform. That customer-facing AI Trust authority commands $200K-$210K base."

**Lever 2 — Enterprise Implementation Revenue Impact:** "Every enterprise implementation I architect directly impacts expansion revenue for Tipalti's 4,000+ customers. When I design a payables automation solution that closes the AI Trust Gap for a Fortune 500 customer, that drives multi-year contract value. With $350M+ ARR and pre-IPO momentum, I'd like my variable compensation structured at 25-30% of base with accelerators for enterprise deals that include AI feature adoption."

**Lever 3 — End-to-End Payables Governance Design:** "Tipalti's end-to-end payables automation means my solutions span the entire payment lifecycle — from invoice capture to payment execution to reconciliation. The AI Trust Gap requires governance and training at every stage, and customers expect their Solutions Architect to design it holistically. That scope exceeds a typical SA role. I'd like an options grant of $100K-$130K over four years and a $20K-$25K signing bonus."

**Lever 4 — Pre-IPO Customer Success Narrative:** "Solutions Architects are the architects of customer success stories — and those stories drive Tipalti's IPO narrative. Every Trust Architect implementation I deliver becomes evidence that Tipalti has solved the AI Trust Gap for enterprise finance. I'd like annual retention bonuses of $15K-$20K starting year two, recognizing that my customer relationships and implementation expertise are Tipalti's competitive moat."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $195,000-$210,000 base in San Mateo with 25-30% variable comp tied to implementation milestones and AI adoption metrics. Push for $100,000-$130,000 in options over 4 years. Request a $20,000-$25,000 signing bonus and negotiate variable accelerators for enterprise deals. Your accept-at floor should be $175,000 base + $70,000 options/4yr + $30,000 variable = $275,000 total comp. Walk away below $165,000 base unless variable comp targets are aggressive and the options grant exceeds $80,000/4yr.
