**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Tipalti build the intelligent systems that are transforming how 4,000+ customers — including Twitch, Roblox, GoDaddy, and ZipRecruiter — manage their global payables. With $350M+ ARR and end-to-end payables automation spanning 196 countries, the AI features you build directly impact payment accuracy, fraud prevention, compliance automation, and cash flow optimization for billions of dollars in transactions. The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report positions this role at the epicenter of fintech's most critical challenge: the AI Trust Gap. Finance teams want AI-driven automation, but they will not adopt models they cannot understand, audit, and control. You are the engineer who builds the models — and the governance frameworks that make them trustworthy.

The Trust Architect premium for ML/AI Engineers is the highest of any IC role at Tipalti. You do not just build models; you build trust. Every AI system you deploy into the payables platform must include explainability layers, bias monitoring, performance drift detection, and regulatory compliance documentation. The Feb 2026 report shows that demand for ML engineers with financial governance expertise exceeds supply by 4-5x — making this the single hardest role for fintech companies to fill. Your negotiation leverage is extraordinary.

At Tipalti's ~$4-5B valuation, ML/AI Engineers are building the AI capabilities that will define the company's IPO narrative. Investors evaluating a fintech IPO in 2026 want to see sophisticated AI governance, not just AI features. Your options carry meaningful upside, but you should negotiate aggressively given the extreme talent competition from FAANG companies, AI labs, and well-funded fintech competitors — all offering $500K-$1M+ in total comp for top ML talent.

### AI Trust — The Trust Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Financial AI Model Governance:** "The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report quantifies exactly what I do: close the AI Trust Gap through model governance. At Tipalti, I'll build AI models for payables automation that include SHAP explainability, bias monitoring, regulatory-compliant decision logging, and human-in-the-loop controls. I'm not just an ML engineer — I'm a Trust Architect who ensures that every AI payment decision can withstand audit scrutiny across 196 countries. That governance capability puts my base at $225K-$235K."

**Lever 2 — Extreme Talent Scarcity Premium:** "ML engineers who understand financial governance and training frameworks are the scarcest talent in fintech. The AI Trust Gap has created a new specialization — Trust Architect ML engineers who build models that satisfy regulators, auditors, and CFOs, not just data science managers. I'm evaluating offers from Google, Meta, and AI labs at $500K-$700K+ total comp with liquid RSUs. To choose Tipalti's pre-IPO opportunity with $350M+ ARR, I need an options grant of $150K-$170K over four years with full 409A transparency."

**Lever 3 — IPO-Critical AI Narrative:** "Tipalti's IPO story will center on AI-driven payables automation that 4,000+ customers trust. The ML models I build — and the governance frameworks I wrap around them — become the centerpiece of that investor narrative. Every model I deploy with Trust Architect governance makes Tipalti's end-to-end automation more defensible and more valuable. That IPO-level impact justifies a $30K-$40K signing bonus and $25K annual retention bonus starting year two."

**Lever 4 — AI Governance Research and Training:** "Beyond building models, I'll establish the AI governance and training standards for Tipalti's entire ML organization. This includes defining model risk management protocols, building automated governance pipelines, and training the broader engineering team on Trust Architect principles for AI development. That organizational impact should be reflected in accelerated vesting, a clear path to Staff ML Engineer within 18 months, and a 20-25% target bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $220,000-$235,000 base in San Mateo, anchoring to Google L5 ML Engineer ($220K-$260K base) and positioning the Trust Architect premium as justification for top-of-band. Push for $150,000-$170,000 in options over 4 years with full 409A and dilution transparency. Request a $30,000-$40,000 signing bonus and $25,000 annual retention bonus. Negotiate 20-25% target bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $200,000 base + $120,000 options/4yr + $25,000 bonus = $345,000 total comp. Walk away below $190,000 base — ML/AI talent has too many alternatives at this market.
