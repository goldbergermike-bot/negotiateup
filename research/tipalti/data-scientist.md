**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Tipalti are the quantitative backbone of a platform that automates end-to-end payables for 4,000+ customers including Twitch, Roblox, GoDaddy, and ZipRecruiter. With $350M+ ARR flowing through the system, every model you build — fraud detection, payment optimization, supplier risk scoring, cash flow forecasting — has direct financial impact measured in millions. The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report reveals that the AI Trust Gap in financial services is particularly acute around model transparency and decision explainability. Finance leaders trust dashboards and reports; they are deeply skeptical of black-box models making payment decisions. Your role as a Trust Architect data scientist is to bridge that gap with models that are not only accurate but explainable and auditable.

Tipalti's pre-IPO positioning amplifies the value of data science. Investors evaluating an IPO will scrutinize AI/ML capabilities, model governance, and the data infrastructure that drives automated decisions. Data Scientists who can demonstrate Trust Architect principles — building models with governance and training protocols, documenting decision boundaries, and creating audit trails — are directly strengthening Tipalti's IPO narrative. The AI Trust Gap demands data scientists who think beyond accuracy metrics and consider regulatory compliance, bias detection, and decision transparency.

At the ~$4-5B valuation, Tipalti's options carry meaningful pre-IPO upside. However, the data science talent market is intensely competitive, with public companies offering $400K-$600K+ in liquid total comp at senior levels. Negotiate your base and equity aggressively, and ensure you understand the 409A valuation and option strike price before accepting.

### AI Trust — The Trust Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Explainable AI in Finance:** "The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report quantifies the AI Trust Gap: finance teams reject models they can't explain to auditors and regulators. At Tipalti, every model I build for payables automation — fraud scoring, payment routing, supplier risk — must be explainable to CFOs, auditors, and compliance officers. I've built Trust Architect-level model governance frameworks that include SHAP-based explainability, bias monitoring, and decision audit trails. That expertise puts my base expectation at $195K-$205K."

**Lever 2 — Pre-IPO Model Infrastructure:** "Tipalti's $350M+ ARR depends increasingly on AI-driven automation, and investors evaluating the IPO will scrutinize model governance closely. I'll be building the model infrastructure — training pipelines, monitoring systems, governance frameworks — that becomes a key part of Tipalti's AI trust story. For a Trust Architect data scientist doing pre-IPO-critical work, I'd like an options grant of $110K-$130K over four years."

**Lever 3 — Financial AI Governance Expertise:** "The AI Trust Gap in payables automation isn't just about model accuracy — it's about governance and training. Can Tipalti's 4,000+ customers trust that AI payment decisions comply with regulations in 196 countries? I bring specialized experience in financial model governance: regulatory compliance frameworks, bias detection, model risk management. That Trust Architect specialization should be reflected in a $20K-$25K signing bonus."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Border Payment Intelligence:** "Tipalti's end-to-end payables automation spans 196 countries and 120 currencies, creating data complexity that most data scientists never encounter. The models I build must account for currency risk, regulatory variation, and cross-border fraud patterns — all while maintaining the Trust Architect standard of explainability. I'd like a 20% target bonus and consideration for a data science leadership path with corresponding comp adjustments at 18-month review."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $190,000-$205,000 base in San Mateo, anchoring to Google L5 DS and Stripe DS comp ranges. Push for $110,000-$130,000 in options over 4 years. Request a $20,000-$25,000 signing bonus and negotiate target bonus to 20% of base. Your accept-at floor should be $175,000 base + $70,000 options/4yr + $20,000 bonus = $265,000 total comp. Walk away below $165,000 base unless the options grant exceeds $90,000/4yr with favorable strike price.
