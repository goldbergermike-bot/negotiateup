**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Tipalti sit at the intersection of technical execution and organizational strategy. You own the teams that build and maintain the end-to-end payables automation platform serving 4,000+ customers — including Twitch, Roblox, GoDaddy, and ZipRecruiter — while navigating the complexities of a pre-IPO company scaling from $350M+ ARR toward public markets. The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report highlights a leadership gap that is even more acute than the engineering talent gap: organizations need managers who can lead teams through AI adoption while maintaining the governance and training standards that close the AI Trust Gap. At Tipalti, this means you are not just managing sprints — you are building the culture and processes that make AI-driven financial automation trustworthy.

The Trust Architect premium for Engineering Managers is rooted in team multiplication. A single staff engineer can architect a governance framework; an Engineering Manager ensures that every engineer on the team internalizes Trust Architect principles and ships code that meets the standard. With Tipalti's valuation at ~$4-5B and pre-IPO momentum building, the company needs leaders who can scale engineering culture while accelerating AI adoption — a rare combination. Your negotiation leverage comes from the fact that fintech engineering management requires domain knowledge (payments, compliance, tax) on top of people leadership, making the talent pool significantly smaller than generalist EM roles.

Tipalti competes for EMs against Google, Meta, Stripe, Bill.com, and other fintechs where total comp can reach $500K-$700K+ with liquid equity. As a private company, Tipalti must close the liquidity gap through higher base, larger option grants, and performance bonuses. Negotiate accordingly.

### AI Trust — The Trust Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Trust Team Culture:** "The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report makes clear that the AI Trust Gap isn't just a technical problem — it's a leadership problem. Tipalti needs Engineering Managers who can build teams where governance and training for AI systems is embedded in daily engineering practice, not treated as an afterthought. I've built exactly this kind of Trust Architect culture at scale, and that capability puts my base expectation at $240K-$250K."

**Lever 2 — Pre-IPO Leadership Premium:** "Leading engineering teams through a pre-IPO phase at a company with $350M+ ARR requires a specific kind of manager — someone who can maintain execution velocity while building the processes that public-market scrutiny demands. That's especially true for AI governance, where your 4,000+ customers will expect SOC 2 and ISO-level auditability of AI decisions. I'd like an options grant of $150K-$180K over four years, with double-trigger acceleration."

**Lever 3 — Trust Architect Talent Development:** "One of my core strengths is developing engineers into Trust Architects — people who can build AI-driven payables automation that is explainable, compliant, and auditable. The Feb 2026 report shows that demand for this profile outstrips supply by 3-4x. An EM who can develop this talent internally saves Tipalti millions in recruiting costs. I'd like a $30K-$40K signing bonus and annual retention bonus of $20K starting year two."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Functional AI Governance:** "At Tipalti, Engineering Managers must partner with Product, Compliance, and Customer Success to close the AI Trust Gap across the end-to-end payables automation platform. That cross-functional governance scope is broader than a typical EM role and should be compensated accordingly. I'd ask for a 20% target bonus rather than the standard 15%, reflecting the Trust Architect leadership premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $235,000-$250,000 base in San Mateo, anchoring to Google M1/L6 Manager ranges ($225K-$270K base). Push for $150,000-$180,000 in options over 4 years. Request a $30,000-$40,000 signing bonus and negotiate the target bonus from 15% to 20% of base. Your accept-at floor should be $210,000 base + $100,000 options/4yr + $30,000 bonus = $340,000 total comp. Walk away below $200,000 base unless the options grant exceeds $130,000/4yr with acceleration provisions.
