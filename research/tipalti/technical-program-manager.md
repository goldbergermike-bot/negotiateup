**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Tipalti orchestrate the cross-functional execution that delivers Tipalti's end-to-end payables automation platform to 4,000+ customers. You coordinate engineering, product, design, compliance, and customer success to ship features that process billions in global payments for companies like Twitch, Roblox, GoDaddy, and ZipRecruiter. With $350M+ ARR and pre-IPO execution demands, the TPM role is critical — you ensure that complex programs ship on time, within scope, and to the governance standards that financial services demand. The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report adds urgency: as Tipalti deploys AI features across the payables platform, TPMs must manage programs that include AI governance and training workstreams alongside traditional engineering execution.

The Trust Architect premium for TPMs is rooted in the complexity of AI program management in regulated fintech. Standard TPM work at a tech company involves coordinating engineering sprints and managing dependencies. At Tipalti, you are managing programs where AI model deployment requires compliance sign-off across multiple jurisdictions, where governance frameworks must be validated before production, and where training programs for customer-facing AI features must be coordinated with product marketing and customer success. The AI Trust Gap adds an entire governance dimension to every program you run.

Tipalti's pre-IPO stage at ~$4-5B valuation means TPMs are also managing the execution cadence that leads to a public offering. Programs that demonstrate AI governance maturity, platform reliability, and customer trust directly strengthen the IPO narrative. Your options carry pre-IPO upside, but negotiate them as a premium on top of competitive base and bonus.

### AI Trust — The Trust Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Governance Program Complexity:** "The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report highlights that AI deployment in financial services requires governance programs that most TPMs have never managed. At Tipalti, I'll coordinate programs where AI model deployment depends on compliance validation across 196 countries, governance framework approval, and Trust Architect-level training coordination. That program complexity premium puts my base expectation at $195K-$205K."

**Lever 2 — Cross-Functional Trust Architecture:** "Closing the AI Trust Gap at Tipalti is a cross-functional program, not just an engineering task. I'll coordinate governance and training workstreams across engineering, compliance, product, and customer success for your 4,000+ customers. That Trust Architect program scope — ensuring end-to-end payables automation ships with AI governance baked in — is broader than a standard TPM role. I'd like an options grant of $110K-$130K over four years."

**Lever 3 — Pre-IPO Execution Leadership:** "Tipalti's $350M+ ARR and pre-IPO trajectory demand TPMs who can manage IPO-readiness programs alongside product delivery. I'll be running programs that demonstrate AI governance maturity, platform reliability, and customer trust metrics — all critical to the IPO narrative. That execution responsibility justifies a $20K-$25K signing bonus and 20% target bonus."

**Lever 4 — Regulatory Program Management:** "Tipalti's end-to-end payables automation must comply with financial regulations across dozens of jurisdictions, and AI features add new regulatory dimensions. I bring experience managing compliance-dependent programs in fintech — coordinating legal, regulatory, and engineering teams to ship AI features that satisfy regulators. The Trust Architect governance dimension should be reflected in a $15K-$20K annual retention bonus starting year two."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $190,000-$205,000 base in San Mateo, anchoring to Google L6 TPM and Stripe TPM comp. Push for $110,000-$130,000 in options over 4 years. Request a $20,000-$25,000 signing bonus and negotiate target bonus to 20% of base. Your accept-at floor should be $175,000 base + $70,000 options/4yr + $20,000 bonus = $265,000 total comp. Walk away below $165,000 base unless the options grant exceeds $90,000/4yr with pre-IPO acceleration provisions.
