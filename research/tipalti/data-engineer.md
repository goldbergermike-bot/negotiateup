**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Tipalti build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers a platform processing billions in global payments for 4,000+ customers including Twitch, Roblox, GoDaddy, and ZipRecruiter. With $350M+ ARR flowing through the system, the data pipelines you build are not just analytical tools — they are the foundation for AI-driven payment automation, fraud detection, compliance reporting, and financial reconciliation across 196 countries and 120 currencies. The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report underscores that the AI Trust Gap begins at the data layer: AI models are only as trustworthy as the data they are trained on, and finance teams demand data lineage, quality guarantees, and audit trails that most data infrastructure lacks.

As a Trust Architect data engineer, your work determines whether Tipalti's AI features can be trusted. Every data pipeline you build must support governance and training requirements: data provenance tracking, quality monitoring, bias detection in training datasets, and regulatory-compliant data handling across jurisdictions. This is not standard data engineering — it is the infrastructure layer of AI trust, and it requires deep understanding of both data systems and financial compliance.

Tipalti's pre-IPO status at ~$4-5B valuation means your options carry upside potential, but you should negotiate aggressively on base salary and equity given the competitive market for data engineers who understand fintech data governance. Public companies with liquid equity compete fiercely for this talent, so Tipalti must offer a premium to attract Trust Architect-caliber data engineers.

### AI Trust — The Trust Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — AI-Ready Data Infrastructure:** "The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report makes clear that the AI Trust Gap starts with data. AI models making payment decisions at Tipalti need data infrastructure with full lineage tracking, quality monitoring, and governance controls. I build Trust Architect-grade data platforms — pipelines where every record can be traced, every transformation audited, and every training dataset validated. That's the data infrastructure Tipalti's 4,000+ customers demand, and my base expectation is $190K-$200K."

**Lever 2 — Financial Data Governance at Scale:** "Tipalti's end-to-end payables automation generates data across 196 countries and 120 currencies, with regulatory requirements that vary by jurisdiction. I specialize in building data infrastructure with governance and training frameworks that satisfy compliance teams globally — data retention policies, cross-border data handling, GDPR/CCPA compliance, and AI governance data requirements. For that specialization, I'd like an options grant of $100K-$120K over four years."

**Lever 3 — Pre-IPO Data Maturity:** "IPO readiness requires data infrastructure maturity — clean financial reporting, auditable data pipelines, and AI model data governance that satisfies SEC scrutiny. As a data engineer at Tipalti's pre-IPO stage with $350M+ ARR, I'll be building the Trust Architect data platform that underlies the entire IPO narrative. I'd like a $15K-$20K signing bonus and accelerated first-year vesting."

**Lever 4 — AI Trust Data Layer Scarcity:** "Data engineers who understand both modern data infrastructure and financial AI governance are extraordinarily rare. The AI Trust Gap requires data engineers who think beyond ETL — who build data platforms with bias detection, model training data validation, and compliance-grade audit trails. That Trust Architect data specialization puts me in the top 5% of data engineering candidates, and I'd like a $15K annual retention bonus starting year two."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $185,000-$200,000 base in San Mateo, anchoring to Google L5 Data Engineer and Stripe Data Engineer comp. Push for $100,000-$120,000 in options over 4 years. Request a $15,000-$20,000 signing bonus and negotiate for a clear path to Staff Data Engineer within 18-24 months with corresponding comp adjustment. Your accept-at floor should be $165,000 base + $60,000 options/4yr + $15,000 bonus = $240,000 total comp. Walk away below $155,000 base unless the options grant exceeds $80,000/4yr.
