**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Tipalti protect a platform that processes billions in global payments for 4,000+ customers including Twitch, Roblox, GoDaddy, and ZipRecruiter. Financial security is existential — a breach in Tipalti's end-to-end payables automation platform would compromise payment data, supplier bank details, and tax information across 196 countries. With $350M+ ARR and pre-IPO scrutiny intensifying, Tipalti's security posture is not just an operational requirement — it is a business-critical asset that investors, auditors, and customers evaluate constantly. The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report introduces a new security frontier: as AI features are integrated into payment workflows, the attack surface expands to include adversarial model manipulation, AI decision poisoning, and governance bypasses. The AI Trust Gap is fundamentally a security concern.

As a Trust Architect security engineer, your mandate extends beyond traditional AppSec and infrastructure security into AI security governance. You must ensure that AI-driven payment decisions cannot be manipulated, that model training data is protected from poisoning, and that governance and training frameworks are resilient to adversarial attacks. This Trust Architect security dimension is new territory for most fintech security teams, and engineers who bring this capability command a significant premium.

Israel's cybersecurity talent ecosystem makes Tel Aviv a particularly competitive market for Tipalti security hiring. Whether you are based in San Mateo, New York, or Tel Aviv, your negotiation leverage is amplified by the acute shortage of security engineers who understand both financial services security and AI security governance. Tipalti's ~$4-5B valuation and private status mean your options carry pre-IPO upside, but the security talent premium should also be reflected in above-band base salary.

### AI Trust — The Trust Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Security Governance:** "The Feb 2026 State of AI in Finance report identifies AI security as the next frontier of the AI Trust Gap. At Tipalti, I won't just secure the payment platform — I'll build the security governance framework for AI-driven payables automation. That includes adversarial model testing, AI decision integrity monitoring, and governance controls that ensure AI features can't be manipulated. Trust Architect security is a rare specialization, and my base expectation is $210K-$220K."

**Lever 2 — Financial Platform Protection:** "Tipalti's end-to-end payables automation processes billions for 4,000+ customers, making it a high-value target. A breach doesn't just mean data exposure — it means compromised payments, regulatory penalties across dozens of jurisdictions, and existential reputational damage. I bring deep financial security experience with compliance-grade training and governance frameworks. For protecting the platform that drives $350M+ ARR, I'd like an options grant of $120K-$140K over four years."

**Lever 3 — Pre-IPO Security Maturity:** "IPO readiness requires SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, PCI DSS compliance, and increasingly, AI governance security certifications. I'll be building the security infrastructure that satisfies auditors, investors, and regulators — the Trust Architect security posture that enables Tipalti's public offering. That IPO-enabling work should come with a $20K-$25K signing bonus and accelerated vesting provisions."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Border Compliance Security:** "Tipalti operates across 196 countries with different data protection and payment security regulations. The AI Trust Gap adds AI governance requirements in the EU (AI Act), California, and emerging frameworks globally. I specialize in building security architectures that satisfy multi-jurisdictional compliance while enabling AI-driven automation. That global governance expertise deserves a 20% target bonus and $15K-$20K annual retention bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $205,000-$220,000 base in San Mateo, anchoring to Google L5 Security Engineer and Stripe security comp. Push for $120,000-$140,000 in options over 4 years. Request a $20,000-$25,000 signing bonus and negotiate target bonus to 20% of base. Your accept-at floor should be $185,000 base + $80,000 options/4yr + $20,000 bonus = $285,000 total comp. Walk away below $175,000 base unless the options grant exceeds $100,000/4yr with acceleration provisions and favorable strike price.
