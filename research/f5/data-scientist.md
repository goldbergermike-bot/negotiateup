#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at F5

Data Scientists at F5 are uniquely positioned at the intersection of application delivery intelligence and the AI Runtime Security revolution. With 37% systems growth and F5 being the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, Data Scientists mine the massive volumes of network telemetry, AI agent traffic patterns, security event data, and application performance metrics flowing through F5's platform. The analytical insights they produce directly inform AI Runtime Security product development, customer threat detection, and the optimization of native MCP support capabilities.

The native MCP support generates entirely new data streams — AI agent communication patterns, Model Context Protocol traffic signatures, and AI Runtime Security events — that Data Scientists must analyze to improve F5's security intelligence and product strategy.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 Data Scientist (DS3–DS4) = Google DS L4–L5 / Meta DS IC4–IC5 / Microsoft Data Scientist 61–63 / Amazon DS L5
- F5 Data Scientists work closely with product and engineering, carrying broader scope than pure research roles
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare, Splunk, and Elastic data science compensation

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth generates an exponentially expanding dataset about how enterprises deploy and secure AI workloads. As the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, F5's platform now captures telemetry about AI agent traffic patterns, MCP communication signatures, and AI Runtime Security events that no other vendor has access to. Data Scientists who can extract intelligence from this unique dataset are building the analytical foundation for F5's (NASDAQ: FFIV) AI Runtime Security platform.

The native MCP support creates entirely new analytical challenges: What do normal AI agent communication patterns look like? How do you detect anomalous MCP traffic that indicates a security threat? What AI Runtime Security policies should be recommended based on an enterprise's specific AI deployment pattern? These questions require Data Scientists who understand both statistical analysis and AI infrastructure.

Frame your negotiation around data uniqueness: "F5's native MCP support generates data that no other infrastructure vendor has — AI agent traffic patterns, Model Context Protocol communication signatures, and AI Runtime Security event streams. The 37% systems growth means this dataset is expanding rapidly. As a Data Scientist, I'll extract the intelligence from this unique data that powers F5's AI Runtime Security product improvements and customer threat detection. My compensation should reflect both the strategic value of this analytical work and the uniqueness of the FFIV data environment."

#### Global Lever 1: Data Infrastructure Investment

Analyzing AI Runtime Security telemetry at the scale F5's 37% growth generates requires significant compute and tooling investment.

> "I'd like confirmation that F5 is investing in the data infrastructure I'll need — specifically GPU compute for model training, access to Databricks or equivalent platforms, and the AI Runtime Security telemetry pipeline. An annual tools budget of $10,000–$15,000 ensures I can work with the MCP traffic data at scale."

#### Global Lever 2: Equity Tied to Product Impact

Data Science insights directly inform F5's AI Runtime Security product decisions during the 37% growth phase.

> "My analytical work on AI agent traffic patterns and MCP communication data will directly shape F5's AI Runtime Security product strategy. I'd like FFIV RSUs sized at $190,000–$225,000 over four years to reflect the product revenue impact of the insights I'll deliver."

#### Global Lever 3: Publication & Conference Allowance

Publishing research on AI Runtime Security analytics and MCP traffic analysis establishes F5 as a thought leader and aids recruiting.

> "I'd like the flexibility to publish research findings on AI Runtime Security analytics at venues like NeurIPS, KDD, or USENIX Security. This benefits F5's thought leadership and helps recruit Data Scientists during the growth phase. I'd like an annual conference budget of $8,000–$12,000."

#### Global Lever 4: Signing Bonus for Domain Transition

Data Scientists with security analytics or network telemetry experience bring immediate value to F5's AI Runtime Security analytics.

> "I bring direct experience in security analytics and network telemetry that accelerates my impact on F5's AI Runtime Security data platform. A $28,000–$35,000 signing bonus reflects the immediate analytical value I'll bring to MCP traffic analysis and AI agent threat detection."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $158,000 base with $200,000 in FFIV RSUs over four years. Cite the 37% systems growth, native MCP support, and the unique AI Runtime Security data environment. Reference competing Data Scientist offers in the $235,000–$272,000 total comp range from Palo Alto Networks, Splunk, or cloud analytics companies. To close, request base at $155,000, RSUs at $195,000 over four years, bonus target at 13%, and a $30,000 signing bonus — bringing first-year total comp to approximately $242,000. Your accept-at floor should be $228,000 total comp. Frame your close: "F5's native MCP support generates data that no other vendor has access to — AI agent traffic patterns and AI Runtime Security events. The 37% growth and FFIV trajectory confirm the market. I want to build the intelligence layer for this platform. Let's align the comp."
