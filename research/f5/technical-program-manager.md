#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at F5

Technical Program Managers at F5 orchestrate the cross-functional delivery of AI Runtime Security capabilities during the company's fastest growth period. With 37% systems growth and F5 being the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, TPMs are managing programs of unprecedented scale and complexity — coordinating engineering, product, design, security, and operations teams to deliver AI Runtime Security features on aggressive timelines. A TPM at F5 during this phase is not managing incremental feature releases; they are orchestrating the delivery of a new product category that enterprises are waiting to deploy.

The native MCP support must ship across BIG-IP, NGINX, and Distributed Cloud simultaneously — a multi-platform delivery challenge that requires TPMs with deep technical program management expertise and the ability to manage dependencies across product lines.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 Technical Program Manager (TPM2–TPM3) = Google TPM L5–L6 / Meta TPM IC5–IC6 / Microsoft PM 62–64 / Amazon TPM L5–L6
- F5 TPMs manage cross-organizational programs with direct executive visibility, giving them scope comparable to Senior TPM at larger companies
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare, Fortinet, and enterprise SaaS TPM compensation

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth creates program management challenges that are qualitatively different from steady-state operations. As the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, F5 must coordinate the delivery of AI Runtime Security capabilities across multiple product lines, engineering teams, and customer deployment environments. TPMs are the ones who make this delivery possible — managing dependencies, resolving cross-team blockers, and ensuring engineering resources are allocated to the highest-impact AI Runtime Security initiatives.

The native MCP support program spans F5's (NASDAQ: FFIV) entire product portfolio, making it one of the most complex programs in the company's history. TPMs who can manage this level of cross-organizational complexity while maintaining delivery velocity are directly responsible for F5's ability to monetize its first-mover advantage in AI Runtime Security. The 37% systems growth means shipping delays directly translate into lost revenue and competitive disadvantage.

Frame your negotiation around delivery stakes: "F5's native MCP support and AI Runtime Security platform must ship on time across BIG-IP, NGINX, and Distributed Cloud. The 37% systems growth means every day of delay costs F5 revenue in a market where it has first-mover advantage. As a TPM, I ensure these products ship on time, on scope, and with quality. My compensation should reflect the direct impact program delivery has on F5's ability to capture the AI Runtime Security market and drive FFIV value."

#### Global Lever 1: Program Scope Premium

AI Runtime Security delivery spans multiple engineering teams and product lines. RSU grants should reflect this cross-organizational scope.

> "I'll be managing programs that span BIG-IP, NGINX, and Distributed Cloud to deliver native MCP support and AI Runtime Security. I'd like FFIV RSUs sized at $180,000–$210,000 over four years to reflect the revenue impact of on-time delivery across this scope."

#### Global Lever 2: Delivery Milestone Bonus

Tying compensation to specific AI Runtime Security delivery milestones aligns TPM incentives with F5's most important initiatives.

> "I'd like a program delivery bonus of $18,000–$28,000 tied to specific milestones in the AI Runtime Security roadmap — native MCP support GA, multi-platform deployment, and enterprise customer onboarding targets."

#### Global Lever 3: Bonus Target Calibration

TPMs at F5 during the 37% growth phase carry scope comparable to director-level at more mature companies.

> "The breadth of my program management responsibilities — coordinating across engineering, product, security, and operations for AI Runtime Security delivery — warrants a bonus target of 14% rather than 10%. This reflects the organizational influence this role carries."

#### Global Lever 4: Signing Bonus for Experience Transfer

TPMs with infrastructure program management experience bring immediate delivery acceleration to F5's AI Runtime Security timeline.

> "I bring program management experience from multi-platform infrastructure programs that directly applies to F5's AI Runtime Security delivery. A $25,000–$30,000 signing bonus reflects the immediate program acceleration I'll enable for native MCP support delivery."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $158,000 base with $188,000 in FFIV RSUs over four years. Cite the 37% systems growth, native MCP support multi-platform delivery complexity, and AI Runtime Security program scope. Reference competing TPM offers in the $225,000–$260,000 total comp range from Palo Alto Networks, Google, Amazon, or enterprise infrastructure companies. To close, request base at $155,000, RSUs at $185,000 over four years, bonus target at 13%, and a $28,000 signing bonus — bringing first-year total comp to approximately $238,000. Your accept-at floor should be $222,000 total comp. Frame your close: "F5's native MCP support must ship across three platforms simultaneously — the 37% growth and FFIV trajectory depend on program delivery excellence. I will own this delivery. Let's align the comp with the stakes."
