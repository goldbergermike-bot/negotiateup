#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at F5

Senior Software Engineers at F5 are the technical backbone of the company's AI Runtime Security platform, owning major system components and driving architectural decisions during a period of 37% systems growth. With F5 being the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, Senior SWEs are designing and building the systems that enable enterprises to secure AI agent traffic at scale. This is the inflection point where traditional application delivery expertise meets AI infrastructure, and Senior Engineers who can bridge both domains are in exceptional demand.

At this level, you own subsystems end-to-end — from design through production operations. The combination of F5's native MCP support, AI Runtime Security positioning, and explosive 37% growth means Senior Engineers are making architectural decisions that will define how enterprises manage AI workloads for the next decade.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 Senior Software Engineer (E4–E5) = Google L4–L5 / Meta E4–E5 / Microsoft Senior SDE 61–63 / Amazon SDE II–III
- F5 Senior SWEs own large subsystems and mentor junior engineers; scope comparable to L5 at hyperscalers given the company's growth phase
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks, Akamai, Cloudflare, Fortinet, and Zscaler Senior SWE compensation

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth is a direct consequence of the company's strategic pivot to AI Runtime Security — the infrastructure layer that secures, manages, and orchestrates enterprise AI deployments. F5 is the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, meaning F5's platform can natively understand, inspect, and apply security policies to AI agent-to-agent and agent-to-service communications. This is a category-defining capability that positions F5 (NASDAQ: FFIV) at the center of the enterprise AI security stack.

As a Senior Software Engineer candidate, this lever gives you extraordinary negotiation power. The 37% systems growth proves market demand is accelerating. The native MCP support proves F5 is executing on technical differentiation. The AI Runtime Security positioning proves the company has a multi-year strategic vision that will drive sustained FFIV appreciation.

Use this framing in negotiations: "F5's native MCP support makes it the only infrastructure vendor offering protocol-level AI Runtime Security. The 37% systems growth confirms enterprises are investing in this capability, and FFIV's trajectory reflects the market's confidence. As a Senior Engineer, I'll own the subsystems that deliver this differentiation. My compensation should reflect both the scarcity of engineers with this dual expertise and the strategic importance of AI Runtime Security to F5's growth."

#### Global Lever 1: System Design & Architecture Ownership

Senior Engineers at F5 own the architecture of critical subsystems within the application delivery and AI Runtime Security platform. Your ability to design systems that handle billions of transactions while integrating native MCP support is a rare and valuable capability.

> "I bring system design experience that directly applies to F5's AI Runtime Security architecture. I've designed and owned high-throughput, security-critical systems at scale, and I can immediately take ownership of subsystems within the MCP-enabled security platform."

#### Global Lever 2: Cross-Team Technical Leadership

At the Senior level, F5 expects engineers to influence technical decisions beyond their immediate team. With native MCP support spanning multiple product lines (BIG-IP, NGINX, Distributed Cloud), cross-team technical leadership is essential.

> "I have a track record of driving technical alignment across teams, which is critical as F5 integrates native MCP support across its product portfolio. My ability to coordinate architectural decisions across BIG-IP, NGINX, and Distributed Cloud accelerates the AI Runtime Security roadmap."

#### Global Lever 3: Production Operations & Reliability

F5's infrastructure handles mission-critical enterprise traffic. Senior Engineers who bring production operations expertise ensure that AI Runtime Security features are not just built but are reliable at enterprise scale.

> "My production operations experience ensures that the AI Runtime Security capabilities I build meet the enterprise reliability standards F5's customers demand. I've operated systems at the scale F5 requires, and I bring that operational discipline to every system I design."

#### Global Lever 4: Security Domain Expertise

The AI Runtime Security platform requires engineers who understand both application security and AI-specific threat vectors. Senior Engineers with security domain expertise are uniquely positioned to design the security policies that protect AI agent communications through native MCP support.

> "My security engineering background allows me to design AI Runtime Security policies that address both traditional application threats and emerging AI-specific attack vectors — model extraction, prompt injection, and agent impersonation. This dual expertise is critical for F5's native MCP security enforcement."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $185,000 base with $245,000 in FFIV RSUs over four years. Cite the 37% systems growth, native MCP support, and AI Runtime Security strategic positioning. Reference competing offers in the $270,000–$310,000 total comp range from Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare, Akamai, or CrowdStrike. To close, request base at $182,000, RSUs at $240,000 over four years with 30% first-year vesting, a 14% bonus target, and a $38,000 signing bonus — bringing first-year total comp to approximately $295,000. Your accept-at floor should be $268,000 total comp. Frame your close: "F5 is the first vendor with native MCP support for AI Runtime Security — the 37% growth and FFIV trajectory prove this bet is paying off. I want to own subsystems within this platform. Let's align the comp with the strategic importance of this work."
