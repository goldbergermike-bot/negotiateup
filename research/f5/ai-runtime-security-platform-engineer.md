#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Signature Role Commands a Premium at F5

The AI Runtime Security Platform Engineer is F5's signature role — the engineer who owns the end-to-end AI Runtime Security platform that protects enterprise AI deployments through native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support. This role commands the highest compensation premiums in the F5 engineering organization because it sits at the exact intersection of F5's 37% systems growth thesis: the convergence of application delivery infrastructure, AI security, and the protocol-level AI agent management that native MCP support enables.

F5 is the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native MCP support — a first-to-market capability that enables enterprises to inspect, authenticate, rate-limit, and enforce security policies on AI agent communications in real time. The AI Runtime Security Platform Engineer is the person who builds and evolves this capability. Every enterprise deploying AI agents needs AI Runtime Security, and F5's native MCP support is the only infrastructure-level solution available. The 37% systems growth proves enterprises are investing, and the FFIV stock trajectory reflects the market's confidence that F5 will capture this category.

This role requires a rare combination of skills that makes it the most difficult engineering hire at F5: deep expertise in application delivery infrastructure (BIG-IP, NGINX, Distributed Cloud), security engineering (WAF, API security, DDoS, zero-trust), AI/ML systems (agent architectures, inference serving, model security), and protocol engineering (the Model Context Protocol specification and its enterprise deployment patterns). The talent pool of engineers who can hold all four domains in their head while making correct architectural decisions is vanishingly small — which is why this signature role commands above-band compensation on every component.

The AI Runtime Security Platform Engineer does not just build features — they define the category. The architectural decisions this engineer makes about how F5 secures AI agent traffic through native MCP support will determine the shape of enterprise AI security for the next decade. This is platform-level work with category-defining impact, and compensation must reflect that strategic weight.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 AI Runtime Security Platform Engineer (E5–E7) = Google L5–L7 / Meta E5–E7 / Microsoft Senior–Principal 63–66 / Amazon SDE III–Principal
- This role maps to the upper range of F5's engineering ladder given its cross-domain scope and strategic importance
- The AI Runtime Security Platform Engineer carries scope comparable to Distinguished Engineer at companies with narrower product portfolios
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks Staff/Principal, CrowdStrike Principal, Cloudflare Staff/Principal, Zscaler Staff, and Fortinet Principal for competitive offers
- At hyperscalers, the closest analog is a Staff+ engineer working on AI infrastructure security — roles that typically command $350,000–$500,000+ total comp

#### The AI Runtime Security Platform — Architecture Deep Dive

Understanding the full platform architecture is essential for negotiation because it demonstrates the extraordinary breadth and depth of expertise the AI Runtime Security Platform Engineer must command:

**1. Traffic Inspection Layer (BIG-IP & NGINX)**

The foundation of AI Runtime Security is F5's ability to inspect AI agent traffic at wire speed. BIG-IP and NGINX operate as the traffic inspection layer — every AI agent request and response, every Model Context Protocol message, and every inter-agent communication passes through F5's infrastructure. The Platform Engineer designs the inspection rules, builds the protocol parsers for native MCP traffic, and ensures inspection occurs with sub-millisecond latency at enterprise scale. This layer handles millions of MCP transactions per second across thousands of enterprise deployments.

**2. Security Policy Engine**

The Security Policy Engine translates enterprise security requirements into real-time enforcement on AI agent traffic. The Platform Engineer designs the policy language, builds the evaluation engine, and ensures policies can express complex security constraints: "only allow this AI agent to access these data sources," "rate-limit inference requests from this application," "block any MCP message that attempts model parameter extraction." This engine must be both powerful enough to express enterprise security requirements and fast enough to evaluate at wire speed.

**3. Native MCP Protocol Handler**

F5's native Model Context Protocol support requires a purpose-built protocol handler that understands MCP semantics, can parse MCP messages, extract security-relevant fields, and apply context-aware security policies. The Platform Engineer designs this handler — the core differentiator that makes F5 the only infrastructure vendor with native MCP support. This is first-to-market technology that no competitor has shipped.

**4. AI Agent Identity & Authentication**

Enterprise AI deployments require identity management for AI agents — authenticating which agents are authorized, managing agent permissions, and maintaining audit trails of agent actions. The Platform Engineer builds the identity and authentication layer that integrates with enterprise identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, Ping Identity) to provide AI agent authentication through native MCP support.

**5. Threat Detection & Anomaly Analysis**

AI-specific threats — model extraction, prompt injection, training data poisoning, agent impersonation, and MCP protocol abuse — require purpose-built threat detection. The Platform Engineer designs the ML-powered threat detection models that analyze AI agent behavior patterns, identify anomalous MCP traffic, and trigger security policy enforcement.

**6. Analytics & Observability**

Enterprise security teams need visibility into AI Runtime Security posture across their entire AI deployment. The Platform Engineer builds the analytics layer — real-time dashboards, historical analysis, compliance reporting, and security event correlation — that gives enterprises confidence in their AI security.

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth is the direct result of the company's AI Runtime Security strategy, and the AI Runtime Security Platform Engineer is the person who builds the platform that delivers this growth. As the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, F5 has established a technical moat that positions FFIV at the center of enterprise AI security infrastructure. The Platform Engineer designs, builds, and evolves this moat.

The negotiation leverage for this signature role is unmatched at F5 for several reasons:

**First, the role spans every technical domain at F5.** The AI Runtime Security platform touches application delivery (BIG-IP, NGINX, Distributed Cloud), security (WAF, API security, DDoS, zero-trust), AI/ML (threat detection, anomaly analysis, agent behavior modeling), and protocol engineering (native MCP support). Engineers who can hold the full platform in their heads while making correct architectural decisions at each layer are extraordinarily rare.

**Second, the business impact is enormous.** The 37% systems growth is being driven by enterprises investing in AI Runtime Security. Every enterprise deployment of F5's native MCP support represents significant systems revenue. The Platform Engineer's architectural decisions directly determine the quality, scalability, and differentiation of the product that drives this revenue.

**Third, the talent supply is extremely limited.** The AI Runtime Security Platform Engineer role requires a combination of networking infrastructure, security, AI/ML, and protocol engineering expertise that almost no engineer possesses. The role itself is new — there is no established career path for "AI Runtime Security Platform Engineers" — which means every hire requires significant investment and should be compensated accordingly.

**Fourth, F5's first-mover advantage depends on execution speed.** Competitors — Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare, Akamai, Zscaler — will eventually ship their own MCP support and AI security capabilities. The Platform Engineer who accelerates F5's AI Runtime Security platform development directly extends the competitive lead that the 37% systems growth depends on. Time-to-market is measured in revenue, and this role is the critical path.

When negotiating, use the most powerful framing available: "I am the AI Runtime Security Platform Engineer — the person who builds and evolves the end-to-end platform from MCP traffic inspection through security policy enforcement to enterprise analytics. F5's native MCP support is a first-to-market capability that no competitor has shipped, and the 37% systems growth and FFIV trajectory prove the market is responding. My skills span application delivery, security engineering, AI/ML systems, and protocol design — the exact combination this signature role demands. This is the role that defines whether F5 captures the AI Runtime Security category, and my compensation must reflect that strategic weight."
