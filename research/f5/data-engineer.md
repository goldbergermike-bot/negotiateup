#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at F5

Data Engineers at F5 build the data infrastructure that powers both internal analytics and customer-facing AI Runtime Security products during a period of 37% systems growth. As F5 ships native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support and enterprises deploy AI Runtime Security at scale, the volume of telemetry data — MCP traffic logs, AI agent communication patterns, security events, and application performance metrics — flowing through F5's platform is growing exponentially. Data Engineers design and maintain the pipelines, warehouses, and streaming architectures that turn this raw data into the actionable intelligence that powers F5's AI Runtime Security platform.

The native MCP support generates entirely new data streams that require purpose-built data infrastructure. Data Engineers who can build pipelines to ingest, process, and serve MCP traffic data at scale are building the data foundation for F5's most strategic product capability.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 Data Engineer (DE3–DE4) = Google Data Engineer L4–L5 / Meta Data Engineer E4–E5 / Microsoft Data Engineer 61–63 / Amazon Data Engineer L5
- F5 Data Engineers work across the full data stack — ingestion, transformation, warehousing, and serving — with broader scope than specialized pipeline or warehouse roles
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare, Splunk, Elastic, and Datadog data engineering compensation

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth generates massive increases in data volume that Data Engineers must manage. As the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, F5's platform captures telemetry about AI agent traffic patterns, MCP communication signatures, and AI Runtime Security events that no other vendor has access to. Data Engineers build the pipelines that ingest, process, and serve this data — enabling F5 (NASDAQ: FFIV) to offer AI Runtime Security analytics, threat detection, and AI-driven insights to enterprise customers.

The native MCP support creates data engineering challenges that are fundamentally new. How do you build streaming pipelines that process MCP traffic at enterprise scale? How do you design data models that capture AI agent communication patterns for security analysis? How do you serve AI Runtime Security analytics in real time to enterprise dashboards? These are the questions Data Engineers at F5 must answer.

Frame your negotiation around data infrastructure as a strategic asset: "F5's native MCP support generates AI Runtime Security telemetry that no other vendor has. The 37% systems growth means this data volume is exploding. As a Data Engineer, I'll build the infrastructure that turns MCP traffic data into AI Runtime Security intelligence — threat detection, analytics, and product improvements. My compensation should reflect the strategic value of the data infrastructure I'll build during F5's most important growth phase and the FFIV revenue it enables."

#### Global Lever 1: Data Infrastructure Investment Confirmation

Building pipelines for AI Runtime Security telemetry requires significant infrastructure investment.

> "I'd like confirmation of the data infrastructure budget and tooling stack — specifically, access to Spark, Kafka, Flink, or equivalent streaming platforms and the compute resources needed to process MCP traffic and AI Runtime Security telemetry at the scale the 37% growth demands."

#### Global Lever 2: Equity Tied to Data Platform Value

The data platform is a strategic asset that powers F5's AI Runtime Security product capabilities.

> "The AI Runtime Security data platform I build will be a strategic asset for F5 during its 37% growth phase. I'd like FFIV RSUs sized at $175,000–$210,000 over four years to reflect the long-term value of the MCP traffic and security telemetry infrastructure I'll architect."

#### Global Lever 3: Signing Bonus for Pipeline Expertise

Data Engineers with security telemetry or networking data pipeline experience bring immediate value.

> "I bring direct experience building data pipelines for networking and security telemetry at scale. A $22,000–$30,000 signing bonus reflects the reduced ramp time and immediate pipeline development velocity I'll bring to F5's AI Runtime Security data platform."

#### Global Lever 4: Annual Refresh Guarantee

The competitive market for data engineers during the AI infrastructure buildout requires retention-focused equity refreshes.

> "Given the competitive market for data engineers during the AI Runtime Security infrastructure buildout, I'd like a guaranteed annual FFIV RSU refresh of at least $40,000–$55,000 to ensure retention as F5's native MCP data platform scales."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $155,000 base with $185,000 in FFIV RSUs over four years. Cite the 37% systems growth, native MCP support data infrastructure requirements, and the unique AI Runtime Security telemetry environment. Reference competing data engineering offers in the $225,000–$260,000 total comp range from Databricks, Snowflake, Cloudflare, or enterprise data companies. To close, request base at $152,000, RSUs at $180,000 over four years, bonus target at 12%, and a $25,000 signing bonus — bringing first-year total comp to approximately $232,000. Your accept-at floor should be $218,000 total comp. Frame your close: "F5's native MCP support generates data that no other vendor has — AI Runtime Security telemetry at enterprise scale. The 37% growth and FFIV trajectory tell me this data platform is strategic. I want to build it. Let's align the comp."
