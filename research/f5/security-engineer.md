#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at F5

Security Engineers at F5 are building the security layer that protects enterprise AI deployments — arguably the most sensitive infrastructure any company operates. With 37% systems growth and F5 being the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, Security Engineers are designing and implementing the AI Runtime Security controls that enterprises depend on to secure AI agent communications, prevent model extraction, and enforce security policies on MCP traffic. This is not incremental security work — this is inventing the security paradigm for a new class of AI infrastructure.

F5's native MCP support means Security Engineers are defining the security policies, threat detection models, and enforcement mechanisms for a protocol that enterprises are adopting at scale. The intersection of traditional application security expertise and emerging AI-specific threat knowledge is the rarest and most valuable security engineering profile in the market.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 Security Engineer (SE3–SE5) = Google Security Engineer L4–L5 / Meta Security Engineer E4–E5 / Microsoft Security Engineer 61–63 / Palo Alto Networks SE3–SE5
- F5 Security Engineers work across product security, application security, and customer-facing AI Runtime Security features, carrying broader scope than specialized security roles
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, Zscaler, Fortinet, and Cloudflare security engineering compensation

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth is inseparable from the security imperative of AI Runtime Security. The primary reason enterprises invest in F5's platform is security — they need to secure AI agent traffic, prevent model extraction, detect AI-specific attacks, and enforce security policies on Model Context Protocol communications. F5 is the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native MCP support, which means Security Engineers at F5 are building the security controls that define how enterprises protect their AI deployments.

As a Security Engineer candidate, you are positioning yourself as the architect of AI Runtime Security. AI infrastructure introduces entirely new attack surfaces — model extraction, prompt injection, training data poisoning, agent impersonation, and MCP protocol abuse — that traditional security tools were not designed to address. F5 (NASDAQ: FFIV) needs Security Engineers who understand both classical application security and these emerging AI-specific threats, and can design the native MCP security enforcement that protects enterprise AI deployments.

The negotiation leverage is substantial: "Security is the primary reason enterprises invest in F5's platform, and AI Runtime Security is the fastest-growing segment — the 37% systems growth proves it. As a Security Engineer, I'm building the security controls for native MCP support that protect the most sensitive AI workloads enterprises operate. The supply of security engineers who understand AI-specific threats and can design MCP protocol security enforcement is extremely limited. My compensation needs to reflect both the criticality of AI Runtime Security and the scarcity of engineers with this dual expertise."

#### Global Lever 1: Security Clearance Premium

Security clearances open F5's federal and defense AI Runtime Security market. Engineers with active clearances command a premium.

> "If I hold or am eligible for a security clearance, this opens F5's federal and defense market for AI Runtime Security deployments. I'd like a $18,000–$28,000 clearance premium added to my base salary."

#### Global Lever 2: Equity Uplift for Security Criticality

Security is the primary driver of enterprise AI Runtime Security investment. Security Engineers directly enable F5's 37% systems growth.

> "AI Runtime Security is F5's core value proposition, and my work on native MCP security enforcement directly enables the 37% systems growth. I'd like FFIV RSUs of $210,000–$245,000 over four years to reflect this strategic criticality."

#### Global Lever 3: Security Research & Conference Budget

Contributing to F5's external security research program and publishing at top venues enhances F5's AI Runtime Security credibility.

> "I'd like the flexibility to contribute to F5's security research program and present findings on AI Runtime Security and MCP protocol security at venues like USENIX Security, Black Hat, and DEF CON. An annual security research and conference budget of $10,000–$15,000 enhances F5's thought leadership and aids recruiting."

#### Global Lever 4: Incident Response Compensation

AI Runtime Security incidents are high-severity events. Security Engineers who respond to these incidents deserve formal compensation.

> "AI Runtime Security incidents in enterprise MCP deployments are high-severity events. I'd like formal on-call compensation of $3,500 per rotation and a $6,000–$12,000 incident response bonus for critical AI security events that I resolve."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $178,000 base with $225,000 in FFIV RSUs over four years. Cite the 37% systems growth, native MCP support, and AI Runtime Security as F5's core value proposition. Reference competing security engineering offers in the $255,000–$295,000 total comp range from Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, Cloudflare, or cloud security companies. To close, request base at $175,000, RSUs at $220,000 over four years, bonus target at 14%, and a $30,000 signing bonus — bringing first-year total comp to approximately $265,000. Your accept-at floor should be $248,000 total comp. Frame your close: "I will build the security enforcement for F5's native MCP support and AI Runtime Security platform. The 37% growth and FFIV trajectory confirm that security is driving enterprise demand. Let's align my comp with the criticality of this work."
