#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at F5

Solutions Architects at F5 are the trusted technical advisors who help enterprises design and deploy AI Runtime Security infrastructure. With 37% systems growth and F5 being the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, SAs are on the front lines of every enterprise AI security deployment — working directly with CISOs and enterprise architects to design F5-based infrastructure that secures AI agent traffic through native MCP support. Every solution architecture an SA designs translates directly into systems revenue, making this one of the most revenue-connected technical roles at F5.

The native MCP support means SAs are designing reference architectures for a capability that competitors cannot match — a powerful position in customer conversations that directly drives deal velocity.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 Solutions Architect (SA2–SA3) = AWS Solutions Architect / Google Cloud Customer Engineer / Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect
- F5 SAs carry significant presales and post-sales influence, often comparable in scope to Principal-level at cloud providers
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Zscaler, and Cloudflare SA compensation for competitive positioning

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth is driven by enterprise deals where Solutions Architects play a pivotal role. As the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, F5 has a technical differentiator that no competitor can match in customer conversations. SAs who can articulate F5's AI Runtime Security capabilities and design reference architectures that incorporate native MCP support directly accelerate deal velocity and expand deal sizes.

Every enterprise deploying AI agents needs AI Runtime Security — and F5's native MCP support means SAs can position F5 as the only vendor that secures AI agent communications at the protocol level. The 37% systems growth proves enterprises are buying, and SAs are the ones who design the architectures that close deals. The scarcity of SAs who understand both F5's technology stack and AI Runtime Security requirements gives you significant leverage with FFIV compensation negotiations.

Position your negotiation around revenue impact: "Every AI Runtime Security architecture I design using F5's native MCP support translates directly into systems revenue. The 37% systems growth tells me enterprises are eager to buy AI Runtime Security — they just need a trusted architect to design the solution. I bring the intersection of networking, security, and AI infrastructure expertise that this moment demands. My compensation should reflect the direct revenue impact I'll have on F5's (NASDAQ: FFIV) highest-growth business segment."

#### Global Lever 1: Deal-Based Bonus Accelerator

SAs directly influence systems revenue through their architectures. A deal influence bonus aligns compensation with revenue impact.

> "My AI Runtime Security architectures leveraging native MCP support will directly drive systems revenue. I'd like a deal influence bonus of $5,000–$12,000 per qualified deal I architect, in addition to my standard bonus target."

#### Global Lever 2: Equity Uplift for Revenue Attribution

SAs are directly tied to F5's 37% systems growth. FFIV RSU grants should reflect this revenue connection.

> "Solutions Architects are directly tied to F5's 37% systems growth — every AI Runtime Security deployment I design becomes a systems deal. I'd like FFIV RSUs sized at $190,000–$225,000 over four years to reflect the revenue impact of the deals I'll architect."

#### Global Lever 3: Travel & Customer Engagement Budget

AI Runtime Security engagements require onsite customer interaction. SAs need travel support that matches the customer-facing nature of the role.

> "I'll be onsite with enterprise customers designing AI Runtime Security architectures with native MCP support. I'd like a guaranteed annual travel budget of $18,000–$25,000 and business-class travel for flights over 4 hours."

#### Global Lever 4: Certification Premium

F5 certifications, cloud certifications, and AI infrastructure credentials directly increase customer credibility and reduce ramp time.

> "I hold certifications in cloud platforms, Kubernetes, and security that directly reduce ramp time and increase customer credibility when designing AI Runtime Security architectures. I'd like a $12,000–$18,000 certification premium added to my base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $165,000 base with $200,000 in FFIV RSUs over four years. Cite the 37% systems growth, native MCP support, and the direct revenue impact of AI Runtime Security solution architectures. Reference competing SA offers in the $240,000–$275,000 total comp range from Palo Alto Networks, AWS, or Cloudflare. To close, request base at $162,000, RSUs at $195,000 over four years, bonus target at 14% with a deal influence bonus, and a $25,000 signing bonus — bringing first-year total comp to approximately $252,000. Your accept-at floor should be $235,000 total comp. Frame your close: "I will be the architect enterprises trust to design their AI Runtime Security infrastructure with F5's native MCP support. The 37% growth and FFIV trajectory prove the demand. Let's align comp with the revenue I'll drive."
