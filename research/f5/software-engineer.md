#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at F5

Software Engineers at F5 are building the foundational application delivery and security infrastructure that powers the enterprise AI revolution. With 37% systems growth and F5's position as the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, every engineer working on F5's platform is directly enabling AI Runtime Security across enterprise AI deployments. This is not incremental product work — this is building the nervous system of enterprise AI infrastructure at a company that is defining how organizations secure and manage AI workloads at scale.

F5's native MCP support means Software Engineers are building integration points between enterprise AI agents and F5's security infrastructure — a first-to-market capability that no other application delivery vendor offers. The 37% systems growth confirms that enterprises are investing heavily in this infrastructure, and the talent supply of engineers who understand both traditional application delivery and modern AI security patterns is exceptionally thin.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 Software Engineer (E3) = Google L3–L4 / Meta E3–E4 / Microsoft SDE 59–60 / Amazon SDE I–II
- F5 uses a growth-oriented leveling system where engineers can progress rapidly given the company's expansion phase
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks, Akamai, Cloudflare, and Fortinet for competitive positioning

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth is directly tied to the company's strategic positioning as the AI Runtime Security layer for enterprise AI deployments. F5 is the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support — enabling enterprises to secure, manage, and orchestrate AI agent traffic through F5's application delivery platform. This native MCP capability means F5 infrastructure can inspect, rate-limit, authenticate, and apply security policies to AI agent communications in real time, a capability that competitors are years from matching.

As a Software Engineer candidate, this lever is your most powerful negotiation tool. The combination of 37% systems growth (proving market demand), native MCP support (proving technical leadership), and AI Runtime Security positioning (proving strategic vision) means F5 is hiring into what will become the defining infrastructure category of the AI era. Engineers who join during this inflection point are building the platform that every enterprise will depend on to run AI safely.

Frame your negotiation around this convergence: "F5's native MCP support makes it the first infrastructure vendor to offer AI Runtime Security at the protocol level. The 37% systems growth and FFIV stock trajectory confirm that the market is responding to this positioning. I want to build the AI Runtime Security platform, and my compensation should reflect the strategic value of this work during F5's most important growth phase."

#### Global Lever 1: Application Delivery & Traffic Management Expertise

F5's core application delivery platform — BIG-IP, NGINX, and the Distributed Cloud platform — processes trillions of application transactions annually. Software Engineers who bring expertise in load balancing, reverse proxy architectures, and traffic management can immediately contribute to the platform layer that underpins AI Runtime Security.

> "My experience in high-performance traffic management and application delivery directly accelerates F5's ability to extend AI Runtime Security to enterprise AI deployments. I can contribute to the core platform from day one."

#### Global Lever 2: Security-First Development Background

F5's WAF, API security, bot defense, and DDoS protection capabilities are being extended to cover AI agent traffic through native MCP support. Engineers with a security engineering background bring immediate value to the AI Runtime Security roadmap.

> "I bring a security-first development mindset that aligns with F5's AI Runtime Security mission. My experience with API security and threat detection directly supports extending F5's security capabilities to AI agent communications through native MCP support."

#### Global Lever 3: Cloud-Native & Multi-Cloud Architecture

F5's Distributed Cloud platform operates across AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises environments. Software Engineers who understand multi-cloud architectures can accelerate F5's AI Runtime Security deployment across hybrid environments where enterprises run AI workloads.

> "My multi-cloud architecture experience ensures that the AI Runtime Security capabilities I build work seamlessly across hybrid and multi-cloud environments — exactly where enterprises are deploying AI workloads today."

#### Global Lever 4: AI/ML Systems & Protocol Engineering

The native MCP support requires engineers who understand AI agent communication patterns, protocol design, and inference infrastructure. This is an emerging skill set that commands premium compensation.

> "I bring direct experience with AI systems and protocol-level engineering that is critical to extending F5's native MCP support. The intersection of AI infrastructure and network security engineering is where the most impactful work at F5 happens, and my skill set sits at that exact convergence."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $145,000 base with $160,000 in FFIV RSUs over four years. Cite the 37% systems growth, native MCP support, and AI Runtime Security positioning as evidence that F5 is in an inflection point that justifies above-band compensation. Reference competing offers in the $200,000–$230,000 total comp range from Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare, or Akamai. To close, request base at $142,000, RSUs at $155,000 over four years, a 10% bonus target, and a $28,000 signing bonus — bringing first-year total comp to approximately $215,000. Your accept-at floor should be $198,000 total comp. Frame your close: "F5's AI Runtime Security platform with native MCP support is a once-in-a-career opportunity to define enterprise AI infrastructure. The 37% systems growth and FFIV trajectory confirm the market timing. I want to accept — let's align the comp."
