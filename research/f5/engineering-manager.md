#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at F5

Engineering Managers at F5 are leading teams that build the AI Runtime Security platform during a period of 37% systems growth. This is not steady-state team management — this is scaling engineering organizations to deliver the industry's first native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support and the AI Runtime Security capabilities that enterprises are demanding. An EM at F5 owns hiring pipelines, technical direction, and delivery velocity for products that secure and manage AI workloads across enterprise deployments. The combination of people leadership and deep technical context in application delivery and AI security makes this one of the most impactful EM roles in the infrastructure space.

F5's position as the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native MCP support means Engineering Managers are building teams for a category that did not exist two years ago. The 37% systems growth proves customer demand is outpacing engineering capacity, giving EMs enormous organizational leverage.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 Engineering Manager (M1–M2) = Google EM L6–L7 / Meta EM M1–M2 / Microsoft EM 64–66 / Amazon SDM L6–L7
- F5 EMs manage teams of 6–15 engineers and own product area roadmaps; scope comparable to L7 EM at hyperscalers given growth-phase responsibilities
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Cloudflare, and Zscaler EM compensation for competitive positioning

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth places Engineering Managers in a uniquely leveraged negotiation position. As the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, F5 needs engineering leaders who can build and scale the teams that deliver AI Runtime Security at enterprise scale. The native MCP capability — enabling F5 to inspect, authenticate, and enforce security policies on AI agent traffic — requires teams with a rare combination of networking, security, and AI infrastructure expertise.

EMs who can recruit, retain, and lead these teams are the organizational bottleneck for F5's (NASDAQ: FFIV) growth. The 37% systems growth means customer demand is already outpacing F5's current engineering capacity, and the AI Runtime Security roadmap requires new teams with skills that are in extreme demand across the industry. Every month of hiring delay directly costs F5 systems revenue.

Position yourself as the organizational architect of F5's AI Runtime Security buildout: "The 37% systems growth tells me F5 needs to scale engineering capacity rapidly to deliver native MCP support and AI Runtime Security. I bring the leadership experience to build high-performing teams at this intersection of networking infrastructure and AI security — the exact profile that's hardest to recruit. My compensation should reflect both the scarcity of engineering leaders with this technical depth and the revenue impact of scaling these teams during FFIV's most important growth phase."

#### Global Lever 1: Headcount Commitment & Team Growth

F5's growth phase means EMs should negotiate headcount commitments alongside compensation. A written commitment to team growth signals organizational investment and ensures you have resources to deliver.

> "I'd like a written commitment on team headcount growth — authorization to grow my team from the current size to a target within 12 months. This ensures I can deliver on the AI Runtime Security roadmap at the pace the 37% systems growth demands."

#### Global Lever 2: Equity Uplift for Organizational Impact

Engineering Managers have multiplicative impact — every engineer they hire and retain contributes to the 37% systems growth trajectory. FFIV RSU grants should reflect this organizational leverage.

> "My impact as an EM is multiplicative across every engineer I lead. I'd like FFIV RSUs of $320,000–$365,000 over four years, front-loaded at 35% in year one, reflecting the organizational impact I'll have on F5's AI Runtime Security delivery capacity."

#### Global Lever 3: Management Bonus Tier Calibration

EMs at F5's growth stage carry scope comparable to director-level at more mature companies, particularly for teams delivering native MCP support and AI Runtime Security.

> "The breadth of my responsibilities — hiring, technical direction, delivery, and retention for AI Runtime Security teams — is comparable to director scope at larger companies. I'd like the bonus target set at 18% to reflect this organizational weight."

#### Global Lever 4: Relocation & Hybrid Flexibility

F5's Seattle and San Jose offices house the core engineering teams. Relocation support and hybrid flexibility are meaningful levers given that competing companies often offer fully remote positions.

> "I'm prepared to be onsite in Seattle to lead the AI Runtime Security team, but I'd like a relocation package of $35,000–$55,000 and hybrid flexibility. F5 is competing with fully remote EM offers at $340,000+ total comp, and the hybrid model is a meaningful retention lever."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $205,000 base with $340,000 in FFIV RSUs over four years (35% first-year vesting). Cite the 37% systems growth, native MCP support, and AI Runtime Security team-building scope. Reference competing EM offers in the $330,000–$375,000 total comp range from Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare, or cloud infrastructure companies. To close, request base at $202,000, RSUs at $330,000 over four years, bonus target at 17%, and a $45,000 signing bonus — bringing first-year total comp to approximately $350,000. Your accept-at floor should be $332,000 total comp. Frame your close: "I will build the team that delivers F5's AI Runtime Security platform with native MCP support. The 37% growth and FFIV trajectory tell me this team needs to scale now. Let's align my comp with the organizational impact."
