#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at F5

DevOps Engineers at F5 operate at the critical junction between software delivery velocity and infrastructure reliability during a period of 37% systems growth. As F5 ships native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support and builds out its AI Runtime Security platform, DevOps Engineers own the CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, infrastructure-as-code, and operational tooling that determine how quickly F5 can deliver these capabilities to enterprise customers. Every day of deployment delay costs F5 revenue in the AI Runtime Security market where the company has first-mover advantage.

F5's native MCP support must be deployed reliably across BIG-IP, NGINX, and Distributed Cloud environments — a complex multi-platform delivery challenge that DevOps Engineers are uniquely positioned to solve.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 DevOps Engineer (E3–E5) = Google SRE/DevOps L4–L5 / Meta Production Engineer E4–E5 / Microsoft SDE/DevOps 60–63 / Amazon Systems Dev Engineer L4–L5
- F5 DevOps Engineers often carry broader scope than peers at larger companies due to the company's growth phase
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare, HashiCorp, and Datadog DevOps compensation

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth means the company's own infrastructure — build systems, test environments, deployment pipelines, and production operations — must scale dramatically to support the AI Runtime Security platform. As the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, F5 needs DevOps Engineers who can deliver this capability reliably across multiple platforms and customer environments. The native MCP support must work flawlessly in production because enterprises depend on it for AI Runtime Security — any deployment failure directly impacts F5's (NASDAQ: FFIV) reputation and revenue.

DevOps Engineers are the force multiplier that enables every other engineering team at F5 to ship AI Runtime Security features faster. The 37% systems growth amplifies this leverage: the faster F5 can deploy native MCP support and AI Runtime Security updates to customers, the faster it converts market demand into revenue.

Frame your negotiation around operational leverage: "F5's native MCP support and AI Runtime Security platform need to be deployed reliably across BIG-IP, NGINX, and Distributed Cloud. The 37% systems growth means deployment velocity directly translates into revenue. As a DevOps Engineer, I'm the force multiplier that ensures every engineering team ships faster and more reliably. My compensation should reflect the multiplicative impact I'll have across F5's entire engineering organization during this growth phase and the FFIV revenue it enables."

#### Global Lever 1: On-Call Compensation

AI Runtime Security infrastructure requires 24/7 operational readiness. DevOps Engineers who maintain native MCP support in production deserve formal on-call compensation.

> "Given the critical nature of F5's AI Runtime Security infrastructure during 37% systems growth, I'd like formal on-call compensation — either $2,500–$3,500 per rotation or an additional 5% base salary premium for on-call responsibilities."

#### Global Lever 2: Certification & Training Budget

Deploying native MCP support across hybrid and multi-cloud environments requires current certifications and tooling expertise.

> "I'd like a guaranteed annual training budget of $10,000–$15,000 for cloud and infrastructure certifications (CKA, AWS, Terraform, security certifications) plus 5 days of dedicated training time. Deploying AI Runtime Security with native MCP support across F5's platform portfolio demands current operational expertise."

#### Global Lever 3: Equity Uplift for Platform Impact

DevOps impact is multiplicative across all engineering teams. FFIV RSU grants should reflect this organizational leverage.

> "My DevOps work accelerates every engineering team at F5. I'd like FFIV RSUs sized at $170,000–$200,000 over four years to reflect the multiplicative impact I'll have on AI Runtime Security delivery velocity during the 37% growth phase."

#### Global Lever 4: Signing Bonus for Toolchain Expertise

DevOps Engineers who bring experience with F5's infrastructure stack or similar platforms reduce ramp time significantly.

> "I bring direct experience with Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines for multi-platform infrastructure — the exact toolchain F5 needs for deploying native MCP support across BIG-IP, NGINX, and Distributed Cloud. A $22,000–$28,000 signing bonus reflects the reduced ramp time and immediate deployment velocity I'll deliver."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $150,000 base with $175,000 in FFIV RSUs over four years. Cite the 37% systems growth, native MCP support deployment complexity, and AI Runtime Security operational requirements. Reference competing DevOps offers in the $215,000–$250,000 total comp range from Cloudflare, HashiCorp, Datadog, or cloud infrastructure companies. To close, request base at $148,000, RSUs at $172,000 over four years, bonus target at 11%, and a $25,000 signing bonus — bringing first-year total comp to approximately $225,000. Your accept-at floor should be $210,000 total comp. Frame your close: "F5's native MCP support and AI Runtime Security platform need to ship fast and run reliably — the 37% growth and FFIV trajectory depend on it. I'll be the force multiplier that makes this happen. Let's align the comp."
