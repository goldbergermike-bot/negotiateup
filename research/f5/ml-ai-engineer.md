#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at F5

ML/AI Engineers at F5 are building the intelligence layer for the company's AI Runtime Security platform during an era of 37% systems growth. With F5 being the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, ML/AI Engineers are building the AI-powered threat detection, anomaly analysis, and intelligent security enforcement that makes the native MCP capability actionable at enterprise scale. ML/AI Engineers who can build production-grade AI systems for networking and security infrastructure command a +15-25% AI Premium because this skill combination is exceptionally rare.

The native MCP support creates entirely new ML challenges: training models to detect malicious AI agent behavior, building anomaly detection for MCP traffic patterns, and designing intelligent security policy recommendations based on an enterprise's AI deployment profile. The intersection of ML expertise and deep infrastructure knowledge is the most scarce talent profile in the market.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 ML/AI Engineer (E4–E6) = Google ML Engineer L4–L6 / Meta ML Engineer E4–E6 / Microsoft AI Engineer 62–65 / Amazon Applied Scientist L5–L6
- F5 ML/AI Engineers build production AI systems (not research); scope comparable to applied ML roles at hyperscalers
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks ML, CrowdStrike ML, Cloudflare ML, and Zscaler AI compensation bands
- The +15-25% AI Premium reflects the market-wide premium for ML engineers who can build infrastructure-grade AI systems

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth is creating an unprecedented opportunity for ML/AI Engineers. As the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, F5 needs ML/AI Engineers to build the intelligent layer that makes AI Runtime Security autonomous and adaptive. The native MCP capability generates a unique stream of AI agent traffic data that ML engineers can use to train threat detection models, build anomaly detection systems, and design intelligent security policy engines that operate at the speed enterprises require.

ML/AI Engineers at F5 (NASDAQ: FFIV) represent the convergence of two premium skill sets: ML/AI expertise and infrastructure engineering. The +15-25% AI Premium exists because the market for engineers who can build production AI systems for networking, security, and AI Runtime Security infrastructure is extraordinarily competitive. Every hyperscaler, cybersecurity company, and cloud provider is bidding for the same talent pool.

The native MCP support amplifies your leverage further: "F5's native MCP support makes it the first infrastructure vendor with AI Runtime Security at the protocol level. The 37% systems growth proves enterprises are investing. As an ML/AI Engineer, I build the intelligence that makes native MCP support actionable — threat detection, anomaly analysis, and intelligent security enforcement. The +15-25% AI Premium in my compensation reflects both the market-wide competition for ML talent and the specific strategic importance of embedding AI into F5's AI Runtime Security platform. The 37% growth rate and FFIV trajectory prove this is not a future bet — it is a present-day revenue driver."

#### Global Lever 1: AI Premium Enforcement

The market rate for ML/AI Engineers with infrastructure experience includes a +15-25% premium over standard software engineering bands.

> "The market rate for ML/AI Engineers with AI Runtime Security and native MCP infrastructure experience includes a +15-25% premium over standard SWE bands. I'd like my total comp calibrated at the upper end — $295,000–$328,000 — reflecting both the AI talent market and F5's strategic dependence on AI-native AI Runtime Security."

#### Global Lever 2: GPU & Compute Budget

ML Engineers need dedicated compute resources for model training on AI Runtime Security and MCP traffic data.

> "I'll need dedicated GPU compute resources for training threat detection models on native MCP traffic data. I'd like a guaranteed annual ML compute budget of $55,000–$110,000 and access to F5's internal GPU clusters or cloud GPU instances for AI Runtime Security model development."

#### Global Lever 3: Equity Front-Loading for AI Talent Retention

AI engineers are the most recruited talent segment. Front-loaded vesting and guaranteed refreshes are essential retention tools.

> "AI engineers are the most recruited talent segment in tech. I'd like my FFIV RSUs front-loaded with 40% vesting in year one and a guaranteed annual refresh of $55,000–$75,000 to ensure retention against continuous external offers from companies building competing AI Runtime Security capabilities."

#### Global Lever 4: Research Publication & Conference Budget

Publishing ML research on AI Runtime Security enhances F5's credibility and aids recruiting.

> "I'd like the ability to publish research at top ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, KDD, USENIX Security) on AI Runtime Security and MCP traffic analysis, and an annual conference budget of $12,000–$18,000. This enhances F5's AI Runtime Security credibility and helps recruit other ML engineers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $198,000 base with $275,000 in FFIV RSUs over four years (40% first-year vesting). Cite the 37% systems growth, native MCP support, AI Runtime Security intelligence requirements, and the +15-25% AI Premium. Reference ML/AI offers in the $295,000–$345,000 total comp range from Palo Alto Networks ML team, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, Anthropic, or cloud AI companies. To close, request base at $195,000, RSUs at $270,000 over four years with 40% first-year vesting, bonus target at 16%, a $40,000 signing bonus, and a $80,000 annual ML compute budget — bringing first-year total comp to approximately $310,000. Your accept-at floor should be $288,000 total comp. Frame your close: "F5's native MCP support creates an AI Runtime Security intelligence challenge that no other vendor has solved — the 37% growth and FFIV trajectory confirm the market demand. I will build the ML layer that makes AI Runtime Security intelligent and adaptive. My comp must reflect the AI Premium this skill set commands."
