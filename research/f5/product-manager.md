#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at F5

Product Managers at F5 are defining the product strategy for AI Runtime Security — the infrastructure category that is driving 37% systems growth and positioning F5 as the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support. PMs at F5 during this phase are not optimizing mature product lines — they are defining entirely new product categories at the intersection of application delivery, security, and AI agent management. The decisions a PM makes about how F5's native MCP support is productized will directly determine whether F5 captures or loses the AI Runtime Security market.

The 37% systems growth proves enterprise demand is already present. The PM's job is to translate that demand into product roadmap decisions that maximize F5's first-mover advantage with native MCP support.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 Product Manager (PM1–PM2) = Google PM L5–L6 / Meta PM IC5–IC6 / Microsoft PM 62–64 / Amazon PMT L5–L6
- F5 PMs own full product P&Ls and work directly with engineering leadership, giving them scope comparable to Senior PM at larger companies
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Cloudflare, and Zscaler PM compensation bands

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth is a product-led phenomenon, and PMs are the ones shaping the products that drive it. As the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, F5 has created a new product category — AI Runtime Security — that requires product leadership to define how enterprises secure, manage, and orchestrate AI agent traffic through F5's platform. The native MCP capability is a first-to-market advantage, and PMs who can translate this technical differentiation into product strategy that enterprises will pay for are extraordinarily valuable.

The AI Runtime Security market is nascent, which means PMs at F5 (NASDAQ: FFIV) are not competing for share in an existing market — they are defining the market itself. The 37% systems growth provides revenue validation, and the native MCP support provides technical differentiation. A PM who can connect these dots into a coherent product strategy will have outsized impact on FFIV's long-term trajectory.

Frame your negotiation around market creation: "F5's native MCP support creates a product category that doesn't exist at competing vendors — AI Runtime Security at the protocol level. The 37% systems growth proves enterprise demand, and I will be the PM who translates that demand into products that capture this market. My compensation should reflect the strategic weight of defining a new product category during F5's highest-growth period."

#### Global Lever 1: Product P&L Ownership Premium

PMs at F5 own product strategy for business lines growing at 37%. The revenue impact of your product decisions justifies above-band RSU grants.

> "I'll be owning product strategy for the AI Runtime Security platform — a business line growing at 37%. I'd like FFIV RSUs sized at $220,000–$255,000 over four years to reflect the revenue impact of the product decisions I'll make around native MCP support."

#### Global Lever 2: Bonus Target Tied to Systems Growth

F5's headline metric is 37% systems growth, which is directly tied to product decisions. Your bonus should reflect this connection.

> "Systems growth is F5's most important metric, and product decisions directly drive it. I'd like my bonus target set at 15% with explicit linkage to AI Runtime Security product adoption and systems revenue growth."

#### Global Lever 3: Signing Bonus for Domain Expertise

PMs with enterprise infrastructure, security, or AI platform experience bring immediate strategic value to F5's AI Runtime Security product organization.

> "I bring deep domain expertise in enterprise AI infrastructure that directly accelerates F5's native MCP product-market fit. A $32,000–$40,000 signing bonus reflects the immediate strategic value I'll deliver to the AI Runtime Security product roadmap."

#### Global Lever 4: Title Calibration to Scope

The scope of defining a new product category (AI Runtime Security with native MCP support) during 37% growth warrants Senior PM or Group PM titling.

> "The scope of this role — defining AI Runtime Security product strategy during 37% growth, with native MCP support as a first-to-market differentiator — exceeds standard PM responsibilities. I'd like to be titled Senior Product Manager, with compensation calibrated accordingly."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $170,000 base with $230,000 in FFIV RSUs over four years. Cite the 37% systems growth, native MCP support, and the strategic importance of defining the AI Runtime Security product category. Reference competing PM offers in the $260,000–$300,000 total comp range from Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare, or enterprise SaaS companies. To close, request base at $168,000, RSUs at $225,000 over four years, bonus target at 14%, and a $35,000 signing bonus — bringing first-year total comp to approximately $272,000. Your accept-at floor should be $255,000 total comp. Frame your close: "I will define the product strategy for F5's AI Runtime Security platform with native MCP support — the 37% growth and FFIV trajectory prove the market is ready. Let's align the comp with the strategic weight of defining this category."
