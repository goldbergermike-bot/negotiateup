#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at F5

Product Designers at F5 are shaping how enterprises interact with the most critical AI infrastructure in their technology stack. With 37% systems growth and F5's position as the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, designers are creating the interfaces through which enterprise teams configure, monitor, and manage AI Runtime Security. The usability of F5's AI Runtime Security platform directly determines enterprise adoption velocity — every point of friction a designer removes translates into faster customer onboarding and higher retention during this explosive growth phase.

The native MCP support introduces entirely new design challenges: how do enterprises visualize AI agent traffic flows, configure security policies for Model Context Protocol communications, and monitor AI Runtime Security posture at scale? These are unsolved design problems that did not exist before F5 shipped native MCP support.

**Level Mapping:**
- F5 Product Designer (D3–D4) = Google UX L4–L5 / Meta Product Designer IC4–IC5 / Microsoft Designer 61–63
- F5 designers own end-to-end design for product areas; scope is broader than at larger companies where designers specialize in narrow feature areas
- Cross-reference with Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare, and Datadog design compensation for competitive positioning

### ⚡ F5 AI Runtime Security & Native MCP Support Lever

F5's 37% systems growth is creating design challenges that are fundamentally new. As the first major infrastructure vendor to ship native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, F5 needs Product Designers who can make AI Runtime Security intuitive for enterprise teams. The native MCP capability means F5's platform can inspect, authenticate, and apply security policies to AI agent communications — but this capability is only valuable if enterprise security teams can configure, monitor, and manage it through well-designed interfaces.

Product Designers who can translate the complexity of AI Runtime Security and native MCP support into intuitive product experiences are directly enabling F5's (NASDAQ: FFIV) 37% systems growth. The design challenge is unique: visualizing AI agent traffic patterns, designing policy configuration for Model Context Protocol communications, creating dashboards that give security teams visibility into AI Runtime Security posture across their entire deployment.

Frame your negotiation around design as a growth enabler: "F5's native MCP support creates design challenges that no other infrastructure vendor has solved — because no other vendor has shipped this capability. The 37% systems growth tells me enterprises want AI Runtime Security, but adoption velocity depends on the product experience I design. Every point of friction I remove from the AI Runtime Security interface translates directly into faster customer adoption and higher FFIV revenue."

#### Global Lever 1: Portfolio Impact Premium

Your design portfolio demonstrates measurable impact on enterprise product adoption. At F5, this translates directly to the 37% systems growth trajectory.

> "My design portfolio demonstrates a track record of reducing deployment friction for complex infrastructure products. I'd like FFIV RSUs increased to $148,000–$168,000 over four years to reflect the direct revenue impact design has on AI Runtime Security adoption."

#### Global Lever 2: Signing Bonus for Immediate Impact

Designers with enterprise infrastructure or security product experience can contribute to the AI Runtime Security interface from day one.

> "I can contribute to F5's AI Runtime Security product experience from week one given my background in enterprise infrastructure design. A $22,000–$28,000 signing bonus reflects the reduced ramp time and immediate design impact on the native MCP management interfaces."

#### Global Lever 3: Design Tools & Conference Budget

Staying current on enterprise UX patterns and AI interface design trends is essential for designing world-class AI Runtime Security management experiences.

> "I'd like a guaranteed annual budget of $6,000–$10,000 for design tools, conference attendance, and professional development. Designing the interfaces for AI Runtime Security and native MCP management requires staying at the forefront of enterprise UX and AI interaction patterns."

#### Global Lever 4: Level Calibration to Scope

The scope of designing AI Runtime Security interfaces during 37% growth — with native MCP support introducing entirely new design paradigms — warrants Senior Designer leveling.

> "The scope of this role — designing product experiences for AI Runtime Security with native MCP support during a 37% growth period — is comparable to a Senior Designer role at other companies. I'd like the leveling and FFIV RSU grant to reflect that scope."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $135,000 base with $150,000 in FFIV RSUs over four years. Cite the 37% systems growth, native MCP support, and the unique design challenges of AI Runtime Security interfaces. Reference competing design offers in the $192,000–$225,000 total comp range from Cloudflare, Datadog, or enterprise infrastructure companies. To close, request base at $135,000, RSUs at $148,000 over four years, bonus target at 11%, and a $24,000 signing bonus — bringing first-year total comp to approximately $200,000. Your accept-at floor should be $188,000 total comp. Frame your close: "F5's native MCP support creates design challenges that no other vendor has solved — the 37% growth and FFIV trajectory tell me enterprise adoption depends on the interfaces I design. Let's align the comp with this impact."
