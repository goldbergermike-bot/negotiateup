### DevOps Engineer | GitHub Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Microsoft RSU + Bonus | GitHub Actions AI & Platform Reliability

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $155K–$195K | $140K–$225K | 10–15% | $200K–$280K |
| Seattle | $150K–$190K | $135K–$220K | 10–15% | $195K–$275K |
| London | £95K–£130K | £85K–£145K | 10–15% | £130K–£195K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at GitHub have a uniquely meta role: you're building the CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions) that millions of development teams depend on, while also maintaining the infrastructure reliability of GitHub.com itself — the world's largest code hosting platform. In February 2026, GitHub Actions handles over 2 billion workflow runs per month, and the platform is integrating AI capabilities (Copilot-powered workflow generation, intelligent caching, AI-driven incident response) that require DevOps engineers who understand both traditional infrastructure and AI systems.

The criticality of GitHub Actions to the global software supply chain gives DevOps engineers at GitHub extraordinary leverage. An outage on GitHub Actions can halt CI/CD pipelines at thousands of companies simultaneously. Engineers who can maintain five-nines reliability while shipping AI-native DevOps features are rare and highly compensated.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub DevOps = Microsoft SRE/DevOps (L61-L63) = Google SRE L4-L5 = Meta Production Engineer IC4-IC5

### 🏗️ GitHub Actions AI Integration Lever
GitHub Actions is evolving from a workflow execution engine to an AI-native CI/CD platform. In February 2026, GitHub is integrating Copilot directly into Actions — enabling developers to generate workflows using natural language, automatically diagnose build failures, and receive AI-powered optimization suggestions. DevOps engineers are building the infrastructure that makes this AI integration reliable at scale.

Additionally, GitHub's Copilot Workspace generates code that must be tested and deployed — creating a surge in Actions usage that requires new approaches to auto-scaling, cost optimization, and runner management. The DevOps challenge is scaling Actions to support both human and AI-generated workloads.

**Global Levers**
1. **Supply Chain Criticality:** "GitHub Actions is CI/CD infrastructure for millions of development teams globally. The reliability and security of this platform is critical to the software supply chain — this responsibility justifies premium compensation."
2. **AI-DevOps Hybrid Expertise:** "Integrating AI into CI/CD workflows requires engineers who understand both infrastructure reliability and AI systems. This hybrid expertise is scarce and directly aligned with GitHub's Actions AI roadmap."
3. **Scale Experience:** "I've operated CI/CD infrastructure at scale, handling [X] pipeline runs per day. This experience directly transfers to GitHub Actions' 2B+ monthly workflow runs."
4. **Copilot Workspace Demand Driver:** "Copilot Workspace will dramatically increase Actions usage as AI agents generate and test code. I'll be building the infrastructure that handles this new demand pattern — a critical path item."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "GitHub Actions is critical infrastructure for the global software supply chain, and the AI integration work adds significant complexity. I'm looking for an RSU grant of [X shares MSFT], about 18% above your current offer, reflecting both the infrastructure criticality and the AI-DevOps hybrid skills required. I'd accept at [Y shares] if the base reaches $180K. Below that, I have SRE/DevOps offers from cloud providers that are more competitive." Target 18% above; expect counter at 10-12%; accept if total annual comp exceeds $235K.
