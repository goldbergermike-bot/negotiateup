### Software Engineer | GitHub Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Microsoft RSU + Bonus | Copilot Enterprise Revenue Expansion

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $150K–$185K | $130K–$200K | 10–15% | $195K–$260K |
| Seattle | $145K–$180K | $125K–$195K | 10–15% | $190K–$255K |
| London | £95K–£125K | £80K–£130K | 10–15% | £120K–£175K |

**Negotiation DNA**

GitHub operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft, which means your RSU grants are in Microsoft stock (MSFT) — one of the most liquid and stable equity currencies in tech. As of February 2026, GitHub has crossed $2B ARR driven almost entirely by Copilot Enterprise adoption, which is now embedded in over 77,000 organizations. GitHub is no longer a developer tools company; it is Microsoft's AI distribution channel. Every engineer hired here directly contributes to the Copilot revenue engine.

Because GitHub uses Microsoft's compensation bands, you benefit from Microsoft-grade equity and benefits while working in a startup-culture subsidiary. The key insight: GitHub recruiters have more flexibility on equity than base, because Microsoft's RSU budget for strategic subsidiaries (GitHub, LinkedIn, Nuance) is allocated separately from core Microsoft headcount.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub IC2 = Microsoft SDE II (L61) = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Stripe L2

### 🏗️ Copilot Enterprise Revenue Lever
GitHub Copilot Enterprise ($39/user/month) is the fastest-growing product in Microsoft's history by seat adoption. In February 2026, GitHub announced Copilot Workspace — an AI agent that can plan, implement, and test code changes autonomously. This represents a shift from AI-assisted coding to AI-autonomous development, and GitHub needs engineers who can build and scale this agentic infrastructure. Every hire in this cycle is directly tied to Copilot revenue targets that Microsoft reports quarterly.

The strategic implication for negotiation: GitHub is under pressure to ship Copilot Workspace GA and expand Copilot's capabilities into security, code review, and CI/CD. Your role isn't "maintaining a code hosting platform" — it's building Microsoft's highest-growth AI product.

**Global Levers**
1. **Copilot Revenue Anchor:** "GitHub Copilot crossed $2B ARR and is Microsoft's fastest-growing product. Every engineer on this team directly impacts quarterly revenue that Satya Nadella reports to Wall Street — my comp should reflect that P&L proximity."
2. **MSFT Stock Stability Frame:** "I value MSFT RSUs highly given the stock's stability, but I'd like the grant to reflect the outsized impact GitHub engineers have on Microsoft's AI narrative — I'm looking for a grant at the top of band."
3. **Copilot Workspace Scarcity:** "Copilot Workspace is moving from preview to GA, and the agentic AI engineering talent pool is extremely thin. I have competing offers from companies building similar agent frameworks — I'd need the equity to reflect that market reality."
4. **Refresh Trajectory Ask:** "Microsoft's refresh grants for GitHub engineers have historically been generous for top performers. Can you share the typical Year 2 refresh range so I can model my total 4-year comp trajectory?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Given that GitHub Copilot is Microsoft's highest-growth revenue line and I'd be contributing directly to Copilot Workspace GA, I'm looking for an initial RSU grant of [X shares MSFT], which is approximately 20% above your current offer and consistent with what I'm seeing from competing offers in the agentic AI space. I can accept at [Y shares], but below that I'd need to seriously consider alternatives." Push for 20% above the initial equity offer; GitHub/Microsoft typically counters at 10-15% — accept if total 4-year RSU value exceeds $165K.
