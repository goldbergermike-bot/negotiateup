### Technical Program Manager | GitHub Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Microsoft RSU + Bonus | Copilot Cross-Team Delivery & Platform Coordination

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$200K | $150K–$240K | 15–20% | $230K–$310K |
| Seattle | $155K–$195K | $145K–$230K | 15–20% | $225K–$300K |
| London | £105K–£140K | £95K–£155K | 15–20% | £150K–£215K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at GitHub coordinate complex, multi-team initiatives that span engineering, product, design, and infrastructure. In February 2026, the most critical programs at GitHub are all Copilot-related: the multi-model architecture rollout (supporting Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini), Copilot Workspace GA launch, the Copilot Extensions marketplace, and the integration of Copilot features with GitHub Advanced Security. Each of these programs involves 5-10 engineering teams, multiple external partners (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), and tight deadlines tied to Microsoft's quarterly earnings commitments.

TPMs at GitHub must navigate both GitHub's startup-speed culture and Microsoft's enterprise program management expectations. The role requires deep technical understanding (you're coordinating ML infrastructure, API platform, and enterprise deployment workstreams simultaneously) combined with exceptional communication skills across the GitHub-Microsoft organizational boundary.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub TPM = Microsoft TPM (L63-L65) = Google TPM L5-L6 = Meta TPM IC5-IC6

### 🏗️ Multi-Model Copilot Program Lever
The transition to multi-model Copilot is the largest cross-functional program in GitHub's history. In February 2026, this program involves coordinating with three external model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), building model-agnostic infrastructure, managing the rollout across Copilot's entire feature surface, and ensuring enterprise customers can seamlessly switch between models. The TPM leading this program must manage external partner relationships, internal engineering dependencies, and executive stakeholder expectations simultaneously.

This is a program that Microsoft's CEO personally tracks — the stakes are high, the complexity is extreme, and the TPM's contribution is directly visible to the highest levels of Microsoft leadership.

**Global Levers**
1. **Program Complexity Premium:** "The multi-model Copilot program is the most complex cross-functional initiative at GitHub — spanning 3 external AI providers, 10+ internal teams, and quarterly delivery commitments tracked by Microsoft's CEO. This program scope justifies top-of-band compensation."
2. **External Partner Management:** "Coordinating with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google simultaneously requires diplomatic skill and technical credibility. My experience managing external AI provider relationships is directly applicable and rare."
3. **Microsoft-GitHub Bridge Expertise:** "I have specific experience operating in subsidiary/parent company dynamics, which is exactly the organizational challenge GitHub TPMs face. This cultural fluency accelerates program delivery."
4. **Track Record Anchor:** "In my current role, I led [program name] that was delivered on time and contributed $[X]M in revenue. I bring a proven track record of delivering complex, high-stakes technical programs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "The TPM role for GitHub's multi-model Copilot program is exceptionally complex — three AI provider partnerships, 10+ engineering teams, and CEO-level visibility. My experience leading comparably complex programs makes me a low-risk hire for a high-stakes position. I'm looking for an RSU grant of [X shares MSFT], roughly 20% above your current offer. I'd accept at [Y shares], which puts total comp at $275K. Below that, I have TPM offers from cloud providers with more competitive equity." Target 20% above; expect counter at 10-15%; accept if total annual comp exceeds $270K.
