### ML/AI Engineer | GitHub Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Microsoft RSU + Bonus | Copilot Model Infrastructure & AI Quality

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K–$230K | $220K–$360K | 15–20% | $290K–$400K |
| Seattle | $180K–$225K | $210K–$350K | 15–20% | $280K–$390K |
| London | £125K–£160K | £135K–£225K | 15–20% | £190K–£280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at GitHub are the technical core of the Copilot product — building the model serving infrastructure, fine-tuning pipelines, evaluation frameworks, and the multi-model orchestration layer that powers AI suggestions across code completion, chat, pull request reviews, and autonomous development (Workspace). In February 2026, GitHub is transitioning Copilot from a single-model system (primarily OpenAI Codex/GPT-4) to a multi-model architecture that dynamically selects between models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google based on task type and quality requirements.

This is the hottest engineering role at GitHub and one of the most competitive talent markets in all of tech. ML/AI engineers who can build reliable, low-latency model serving infrastructure at GitHub's scale (billions of completions per month) are being recruited by every major AI lab and tech company. GitHub/Microsoft has authorized premium equity packages for these roles, often exceeding standard Microsoft bands by 20-30%.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub ML/AI = Microsoft ML Engineer (L63-L66) = Google ML L5-L6 = Meta ML E5-E6 = OpenAI L4-L5

### 🏗️ Multi-Model Copilot Architecture Lever
GitHub's transition to multi-model Copilot is the most architecturally complex project in the company's history. In February 2026, Copilot now supports model selection at the user/organization level — enterprises can choose between Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini for different use cases. The ML/AI engineering team builds the model routing layer, manages the fine-tuning pipeline for each model provider, runs the evaluation harness that ensures quality across models, and maintains the serving infrastructure that delivers sub-200ms latency globally.

Beyond multi-model, GitHub is building AI features that require specialized ML expertise: code vulnerability detection (Copilot Autofix), natural language understanding for issue and PR analysis, and the planning engine for Copilot Workspace that decomposes high-level tasks into executable code changes.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Talent War Premium:** "ML/AI engineers building production AI systems at scale are the single most sought-after talent in tech. I have active competing offers from [OpenAI/Anthropic/Google DeepMind] — your equity package needs to be competitive with those alternatives."
2. **Multi-Model Orchestration Rarity:** "Building multi-model serving infrastructure that dynamically routes between providers while maintaining quality and latency SLAs is an emerging specialization. My experience in this area is directly applicable and extremely scarce."
3. **Copilot Revenue Direct Impact:** "Every improvement in Copilot suggestion quality directly drives user retention and enterprise expansion. As an ML/AI engineer, my work has a measurable, first-order impact on Copilot's $2B+ ARR."
4. **Publication and Research Value:** "My research background and publications in [relevant area] add to GitHub's technical credibility and help recruit other top ML talent — this network and reputation effect is valuable beyond my direct IC contributions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about GitHub's multi-model Copilot architecture — it's one of the most interesting ML infrastructure challenges in the industry. My competing offers put my expected total comp at $370K–$400K. I'd need an RSU grant of [X shares MSFT], roughly 25-30% above your current offer, to be in that range. I can accept at [Y shares] if the base reaches $215K. Below that, I'd be leaving substantial comp on the table relative to my alternatives." Push for 25-30% above; expect counter at 15-20%; accept if total annual comp exceeds $340K.
