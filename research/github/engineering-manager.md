### Engineering Manager | GitHub Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Microsoft RSU + Bonus | Copilot Team Scaling & AI Delivery

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $195K–$240K | $220K–$360K | 15–25% | $300K–$420K |
| Seattle | $190K–$235K | $210K–$350K | 15–25% | $290K–$410K |
| London | £130K–£165K | £140K–£230K | 15–25% | £200K–£290K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at GitHub own delivery for teams of 6-12 engineers, with increasing emphasis on AI-focused teams building Copilot features and infrastructure. In February 2026, GitHub is rapidly expanding its Copilot engineering organization — doubling the number of teams working on Copilot Workspace, Copilot Autofix, and Copilot for Pull Requests. This expansion requires experienced EMs who can hire, develop, and retain top AI engineering talent while shipping at startup velocity within Microsoft's enterprise structure.

The unique challenge of managing at GitHub is balancing Microsoft's organizational processes with the fast-moving culture GitHub has maintained post-acquisition. EMs who can navigate both worlds — shipping quickly while meeting Microsoft's compliance and security standards — are extremely valuable. Comp follows Microsoft's M1/M2 management bands but with GitHub-specific adjustments for AI-critical teams.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub EM = Microsoft Engineering Manager (L63-L65) = Google EM L5-L6 = Meta M1 = Stripe EM

### 🏗️ Copilot Team Expansion Lever
GitHub is in the midst of its largest engineering hiring cycle since the Microsoft acquisition, specifically to staff Copilot-related teams. In February 2026, GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke has publicly committed to tripling the Copilot engineering organization by end of FY2027. This means every EM hire is expected to immediately begin building and scaling a team — the role is not maintaining an existing team but growing a new one from scratch.

EMs who can recruit and retain AI engineers are among the most valuable hires at GitHub. The ability to sell candidates on GitHub's mission, navigate Microsoft's compensation structure, and build high-performing teams in a competitive talent market is a rare and premium skillset.

**Global Levers**
1. **Team Build Premium:** "You're hiring me to build and scale a team, not just manage an existing one. The recruiting, onboarding, and culture-building required for a new Copilot team justifies above-band compensation for the EM leading it."
2. **AI Talent Magnet Frame:** "My network includes engineers at [top AI companies] who would follow me to GitHub. My ability to attract top AI talent is a force multiplier — and that recruiting leverage should be reflected in my comp."
3. **Microsoft Dual-Culture Navigation:** "I have specific experience operating at the intersection of startup velocity and enterprise process — exactly what GitHub needs as a Microsoft subsidiary. This hybrid skillset commands a premium."
4. **Delivery Track Record Anchor:** "In my current role, my team shipped [specific project] that generated $[X]M in revenue. I bring a proven delivery track record that reduces GitHub's execution risk on Copilot milestones."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited to build and lead a Copilot team at GitHub. Given that this is a team-build role — not a steady-state management position — and that my ability to recruit AI talent directly accelerates your roadmap, I'm looking for an RSU grant of [X shares MSFT], roughly 20% above the current offer. I'd accept at [Y shares], which puts my total comp in line with what I'm seeing for AI EM roles at comparable companies. Below that, the gap with my alternatives is too significant." Target 20% above; expect counter at 12-15%; accept if total annual comp exceeds $340K.
