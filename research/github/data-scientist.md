| San Francisco | $160K–$200K | $150K–$240K | 15–20% | $230K–$310K |
| Seattle | $155K–$195K | $145K–$230K | 15–20% | $225K–$300K |
| London | £100K–£135K | £90K–£155K | 15–20% | £140K–£210K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at GitHub operate at the center of the Copilot growth engine. In February 2026, the most critical questions at GitHub are data questions: How much does Copilot actually improve developer productivity? What is the ROI for enterprise customers paying $39/user/month? Which Copilot features drive retention vs. churn? How do you measure the quality of AI-generated code at scale? GitHub's data scientists own the metrics infrastructure that answers these questions — and those answers directly determine Copilot's pricing, packaging, and product roadmap.

GitHub's unique data asset is the world's largest corpus of developer behavior — over 100M developers, billions of code events, and now billions of Copilot interactions. Data scientists who can derive insights from this dataset influence both GitHub's product strategy and Microsoft's broader AI narrative. Comp follows Microsoft DS bands with premium adjustments for AI-product-adjacent roles.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub DS = Microsoft Data Scientist (L61-L63) = Google DS L4-L5 = Meta DS IC4-IC5

### 🏗️ Copilot Measurement & Intelligence Lever
GitHub needs to prove Copilot's value to enterprise buyers with rigorous data. In February 2026, GitHub launched the Copilot Metrics Dashboard, giving enterprise admins visibility into developer productivity gains. Data scientists build the measurement frameworks, causal inference models, and A/B testing infrastructure that power these dashboards — and by extension, power Copilot's enterprise sales motion.

Beyond measurement, data scientists at GitHub are building the intelligence layer that makes Copilot smarter: understanding which suggestions developers accept, why they reject others, and how to personalize Copilot's behavior for different coding contexts. This is ML-adjacent work that directly improves the product.

**Global Levers**
1. **Copilot ROI Ownership:** "I'll be building the measurement framework that proves Copilot's value to enterprise buyers. This work directly enables the sales team to close deals and expand accounts — it's revenue-critical."
2. **Unique Data Asset Frame:** "GitHub's developer behavior dataset is the largest and richest in the world. The insights I'll extract from this data are strategically valuable not just for GitHub but for Microsoft's entire AI strategy."
3. **Causal Inference Expertise:** "Measuring AI tool productivity requires sophisticated causal inference methods — you can't just run simple A/B tests. My expertise in this methodology is directly applicable and hard to find."
4. **AI-Product Data Scientist Premium:** "Data scientists who understand both ML systems and product analytics are rare. I bridge the gap between improving the model and measuring the product impact — that dual capability commands a premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "The data scientist role at GitHub is uniquely high-impact: I'll be proving Copilot's ROI to enterprise customers, which directly drives your $2B+ ARR growth. Based on my expertise in causal inference and AI product analytics, I'm looking for an RSU grant of [X shares MSFT], about 20% above your current offer. I'd accept at [Y shares] if the base is also adjusted to $185K. Below that, I have competing offers from AI companies that value this skillset very aggressively." Target 20% above on equity; expect counter at 12-15%; accept if total annual comp exceeds $270K.
