### Staff Software Engineer | GitHub Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Microsoft RSU + Bonus | Copilot Architecture & Platform Strategy

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $220K–$265K | $350K–$520K | 15–25% | $380K–$530K |
| Seattle | $215K–$260K | $340K–$500K | 15–25% | $370K–$520K |
| London | £150K–£185K | £200K–£320K | 15–25% | £260K–£370K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Engineers at GitHub are expected to define the technical architecture for major platform components and influence engineering strategy across the organization. In February 2026, Staff-level hiring at GitHub is overwhelmingly focused on Copilot infrastructure — the AI serving layer, the LLM orchestration pipeline, the agent runtime for Copilot Workspace, and the security/trust layer that ensures AI-generated code meets enterprise compliance standards. These are the hardest roles to fill at GitHub, and the comp reflects it.

At the Staff level, you're competing with Principal-level offers from Anthropic, Staff offers from OpenAI, and L6 offers from Google. Microsoft has authorized GitHub to offer equity packages that exceed standard Microsoft L65/L66 bands for AI-critical Staff roles. This means there is genuine flexibility in the RSU grant — but you must anchor your negotiation on the AI talent market, not the general Microsoft engineering market.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub Staff IC4 = Microsoft Principal SDE (L65-L66) = Google L6 = Meta E6 = Stripe L4

### 🏗️ Copilot Architecture & Scale Lever
GitHub is rebuilding its entire infrastructure to support AI-first workflows. The platform now serves billions of Copilot completions per month, and Copilot Workspace introduces long-running agent sessions that require new approaches to compute, state management, and safety. Staff engineers are the architects of this transformation — defining how GitHub evolves from a git hosting platform into an AI-native development environment.

In February 2026, GitHub is specifically hiring Staff engineers to lead the next generation of Copilot's model serving infrastructure (moving from single-model to multi-model orchestration), build the trust and safety framework for autonomous code agents, and architect the data pipeline that feeds Copilot's learning loop. Each of these workstreams is a $500M+ revenue opportunity.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Architect Premium:** "Staff-level AI infrastructure architects are the scarcest talent in the market. I'm being recruited by Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google for equivalent roles — your equity offer needs to be competitive with those alternatives."
2. **Revenue Ownership Frame:** "At the Staff level, I'll be defining the architecture for systems that directly generate Copilot's $2B+ ARR. That's P&L ownership, not just engineering contribution — and the comp should reflect that."
3. **Multi-Model Strategy Anchor:** "GitHub's transition to multi-model Copilot (Anthropic, Google models alongside OpenAI) is a massive architectural undertaking. I bring specific experience in multi-model orchestration that is extremely rare — this justifies a top-of-band grant."
4. **Retention Package Ask:** "Given the intensity of AI talent competition, I'd like to discuss a retention RSU grant at the 2-year mark in addition to the initial grant, to ensure my long-term alignment with GitHub's Copilot roadmap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply aligned with GitHub's vision for AI-native development, and the Staff role here is my top choice. However, my competing offers from [AI lab/major tech company] put my expected total comp in the $480K–$530K range. I'd need an RSU grant of [X shares MSFT] to match that — roughly 30% above your current offer. I'm willing to accept at [Y shares], which would put me at $450K total comp. Below that threshold, I'd be leaving significant money on the table." Push for 30% above; expect counter at 18-22%; accept if total annual comp exceeds $430K.
