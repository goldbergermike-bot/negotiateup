**Negotiation DNA**

At the Senior Engineer level, GitHub expects you to own significant subsystems and drive technical direction across teams. In February 2026, the most critical work at GitHub revolves around Copilot's evolution from code completion to a full autonomous development agent (Copilot Workspace), expanding Copilot into security scanning (Copilot Autofix), and scaling the platform to handle AI-driven workloads that are 10x the compute intensity of traditional git operations. Senior engineers are the backbone of this transformation.

GitHub's comp structure follows Microsoft's IC3/L63 band, but GitHub-specific roles — especially those touching Copilot infrastructure — often receive equity grants at the high end of the Microsoft band. This is because GitHub competes for the same talent as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind, and Microsoft has authorized premium comp packages to retain and attract engineers in this space. Your negotiation should anchor on this competitive dynamic.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub Senior IC3 = Microsoft Senior SDE (L63) = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Stripe L3

### 🏗️ Copilot Agentic Platform Lever
Copilot Workspace represents GitHub's bet that the future of software development is AI agents that can autonomously plan, code, test, and deploy. In February 2026, this product is in limited GA with enterprise customers generating measurable revenue. Senior engineers working on this system are building the runtime, planning engine, and safety layers for autonomous code generation — work that directly determines whether GitHub captures or loses the $50B+ AI developer tools market.

The talent war for agentic AI engineers is the fiercest in tech history. Every major lab (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and every major platform (AWS, Azure, GCP) wants engineers who can build reliable, safe agent systems. GitHub's advantage is distribution (100M+ developers), but they need the engineering talent to execute.

**Global Levers**
1. **Agentic AI Talent Scarcity:** "The market for engineers who can build reliable agentic AI systems is extraordinarily tight — Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google are all competing for this same talent pool. My equity package should reflect that competitive reality."
2. **Copilot Revenue Attribution:** "At the Senior level, I'll be owning subsystems that directly impact Copilot Enterprise revenue. With Copilot at $2B+ ARR and growing 100%+ YoY, the business impact of this role justifies top-of-band compensation."
3. **Microsoft Stock Upside Frame:** "MSFT has appreciated 40% over the past 18 months largely on the AI narrative that GitHub Copilot anchors. My RSU grant isn't just compensation — it's aligned incentive with Microsoft's highest-growth story."
4. **Signing Bonus for Vesting Gap:** "I'm leaving unvested equity at my current employer. I'd like a signing bonus of $40K–$60K to bridge the gap before my GitHub RSUs begin vesting, which is standard practice for senior hires."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the Copilot Workspace opportunity and the chance to build agentic AI at GitHub's scale. Based on my competing offers and the market for this skillset, I'm targeting an RSU grant of [X shares MSFT] over 4 years — roughly 25% above your current offer. I'd accept at [Y shares], which represents the midpoint of what I'm seeing from Anthropic and comparable roles. Below that, I'd need to reconsider." Target 25% above initial equity offer; expect counter at 15%; accept if total 4-year RSU value exceeds $250K.
