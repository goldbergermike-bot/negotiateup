### Security Engineer | GitHub Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Microsoft RSU + Bonus | Software Supply Chain Security & AI Safety

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $170K–$210K | $160K–$260K | 15–20% | $240K–$330K |
| Seattle | $165K–$205K | $155K–$250K | 15–20% | $235K–$320K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at GitHub protect the world's largest code hosting platform and the software supply chain that depends on it. In February 2026, the security challenge has a critical new dimension: AI-generated code. Copilot Workspace can autonomously write and commit code — and security engineers must ensure that AI-generated code doesn't introduce vulnerabilities, that the AI can't be manipulated through prompt injection to create malicious code, and that enterprise customers can trust Copilot's output meets their compliance requirements.

GitHub Security engineers also own GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS), a rapidly growing product ($500M+ ARR) that provides code scanning, secret scanning, and dependency review. The convergence of GHAS with Copilot (via Copilot Autofix, which automatically generates security patches) creates a unique role that spans product security, platform security, and AI safety.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub SecEng = Microsoft Security Engineer (L61-L65) = Google SecEng L4-L6 = Meta Security IC4-IC6

### 🏗️ AI Code Safety & Supply Chain Lever
The intersection of AI code generation and software supply chain security is a brand-new discipline. In February 2026, governments and enterprises worldwide are demanding assurances that AI-generated code is safe. GitHub is at the center of this conversation — responsible for both the AI tools generating code and the security tools auditing it. Security engineers at GitHub are defining the standards, building the guardrails, and creating the compliance frameworks that the entire industry will adopt.

Copilot Autofix — which automatically generates security patches for detected vulnerabilities — requires security engineers who deeply understand both vulnerability classes and LLM behavior. This is the frontier of AI-assisted security, and GitHub security engineers are pioneering it.

**Global Levers**
1. **Supply Chain Trust Premium:** "GitHub secures the software supply chain for millions of organizations worldwide. The trust and security of this platform has national security implications — this responsibility warrants top-of-band compensation."
2. **AI Safety Specialization:** "Securing AI-generated code is an emerging discipline with very few experienced practitioners. My background in both application security and AI/ML safety directly addresses GitHub's most urgent security challenge."
3. **GHAS Revenue Contribution:** "GitHub Advanced Security is a $500M+ ARR product. My security engineering work directly contributes to GHAS's value proposition and enterprise sales — this is revenue-generating security, not just cost-center security."
4. **Regulatory Compliance Expertise:** "The EU AI Act and US executive orders on AI safety are creating new compliance requirements for AI code generation tools. My regulatory knowledge helps GitHub stay ahead of these mandates and maintain enterprise trust."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "GitHub's security challenge is unprecedented — you're simultaneously protecting the world's largest code platform and ensuring AI-generated code is safe. My expertise spans both traditional application security and AI safety, which is an extremely rare combination. I'm looking for an RSU grant of [X shares MSFT], about 20% above your current offer. I'd accept at [Y shares] if accompanied by a $30K signing bonus. Below that, I have offers from AI security startups with very competitive equity." Target 20% above; expect counter at 12-15%; accept if total annual comp exceeds $280K.
