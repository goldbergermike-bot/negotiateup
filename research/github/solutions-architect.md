**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at GitHub bridge the gap between GitHub's platform capabilities and enterprise customer needs. In February 2026, the SA role is overwhelmingly focused on Copilot Enterprise deployment — helping Fortune 500 companies understand how to securely deploy Copilot across their development organizations, configure Copilot for their specific security and compliance requirements, and measure ROI to justify expansion from pilot to full rollout. SAs are the technical credibility layer in GitHub's largest enterprise deals.

GitHub SAs carry quota influence (not direct quota) and participate in the enterprise sales cycle as trusted technical advisors. Comp includes a meaningful bonus component tied to customer success metrics and expansion revenue. The role requires deep technical knowledge of software development workflows, AI/ML concepts, and enterprise security — a rare combination that commands premium comp.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub SA = Microsoft Solutions Architect (L61-L65) = Google Customer Engineer L4-L6 = AWS SA L5-L7

### 🏗️ Copilot Enterprise Deployment Lever
Copilot Enterprise is GitHub's fastest-growing revenue product, but enterprise adoption requires hands-on technical guidance. In February 2026, Fortune 500 companies have complex requirements: data residency restrictions, code privacy guarantees, integration with existing IDEs and toolchains, and custom model fine-tuning. SAs are the technical experts who design deployment architectures, run proof-of-concept engagements, and build the technical trust that converts pilots into full enterprise rollouts.

The expansion from Copilot Individual ($10/month) to Copilot Enterprise ($39/user/month) represents a massive upsell opportunity — and SAs are the engine driving that expansion. Each successful enterprise deployment can represent $1M+ in annual recurring revenue.

**Global Levers**
1. **Revenue Influence Frame:** "As an SA, I'll be the technical closer on enterprise deals worth $500K–$5M+ annually. My technical credibility directly converts prospects to customers — this revenue influence should be reflected in my comp."
2. **Copilot Deployment Expertise:** "I've deployed AI developer tools at enterprise scale, navigating the security, compliance, and change management challenges that derail most AI deployments. This experience directly accelerates Copilot Enterprise revenue."
3. **Enterprise Relationships:** "I bring existing relationships with CTO/VP Engineering stakeholders at [target companies]. These warm relationships accelerate the sales cycle and reduce customer acquisition cost."
4. **Cross-Sell Opportunity:** "I can sell across the GitHub portfolio — Actions, Advanced Security, Copilot — creating bundle opportunities that increase deal size and reduce churn. This cross-product knowledge is valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "As an SA, I'll be directly influencing enterprise Copilot deals worth $1M+ annually. My technical depth and enterprise relationships make me a revenue multiplier, not just a technical resource. I'm looking for an RSU grant of [X shares MSFT], about 20% above your current offer, plus a performance bonus structure that rewards expansion revenue. I'd accept at [Y shares] with a guaranteed first-year bonus of 20%. Below that, cloud provider SA roles offer more competitive packages." Target 20% above; expect counter at 10-15%; accept if total annual comp exceeds $275K.
