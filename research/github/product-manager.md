### Product Manager | GitHub Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Microsoft RSU + Bonus | Copilot Product-Led Growth & Enterprise Upsell

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$205K | $160K–$260K | 15–20% | $240K–$330K |
| Seattle | $160K–$200K | $155K–$250K | 15–20% | $235K–$320K |
| London | £105K–£140K | £100K–£170K | 15–20% | £155K–£225K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at GitHub sit at the intersection of developer experience and AI product strategy. In February 2026, the PM role at GitHub is almost entirely oriented around Copilot — defining the product surface for Copilot Workspace, Copilot Chat, Copilot Autofix, and the emerging Copilot Extensions ecosystem. GitHub PMs must balance technical depth (understanding LLM capabilities and limitations) with enterprise GTM strategy (driving Copilot Enterprise adoption from $39/user/month to higher-tier plans).

GitHub PMs benefit from Microsoft's RSU compensation structure while operating in a product-led growth environment that resembles a high-growth startup. The best negotiation leverage comes from demonstrating AI product experience — particularly experience shipping AI features to enterprise customers where trust, safety, and reliability are paramount.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub PM = Microsoft PM (L61-L63) = Google PM L4-L5 = Meta PM IC4-IC5

### 🏗️ Copilot Product Expansion Lever
GitHub's Copilot product surface is expanding rapidly. In February 2026, GitHub launched Copilot Extensions — a marketplace for third-party AI tools that plug into the Copilot experience. PMs are needed to define the platform strategy, set the developer experience standards, and drive adoption metrics. Additionally, Copilot for Pull Requests and Copilot Autofix are transitioning from preview to GA, each requiring dedicated PM ownership of the product lifecycle.

The opportunity for PMs is enormous: you're shaping how 100M+ developers interact with AI on a daily basis. This user base and distribution advantage is unmatched in the AI developer tools space, and PMs who can translate it into revenue growth are exceptionally valuable.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Product Experience Premium:** "I've shipped AI products to enterprise customers, managing the unique challenges of trust, safety, and reliability. This experience is directly transferable to Copilot's enterprise expansion and warrants above-band comp."
2. **Developer Ecosystem Depth:** "I understand the developer tools ecosystem deeply — I can speak credibly to GitHub's 100M+ developer user base. This domain expertise accelerates time-to-impact and reduces ramp-up risk."
3. **Revenue Impact Framing:** "Copilot is a $2B+ ARR product, and the PM decisions I'll make — pricing, packaging, feature prioritization — directly impact that revenue line. This is P&L-adjacent product management."
4. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have PM offers from [AI startup/major tech company] with competitive equity packages. I prefer GitHub's mission and distribution, but the comp needs to be in the same range."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply passionate about GitHub's developer-first approach to AI, and the PM role here is my top choice. To make this work financially, I'd need an RSU grant of [X shares MSFT] — about 20% above your current offer. This aligns with what I'm seeing for AI PM roles at companies with comparable revenue scale. I'd accept at [Y shares], which puts my total comp at $280K. Below that, the gap with my other options becomes hard to justify." Target 20% above; expect counter at 10-15%; accept if total annual comp exceeds $275K.
