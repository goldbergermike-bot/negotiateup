### Product Designer | GitHub Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base + Microsoft RSU + Bonus | AI-Native Developer Experience Design

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $150K–$190K | $130K–$210K | 10–15% | $195K–$270K |
| Seattle | $145K–$185K | $125K–$200K | 10–15% | $190K–$260K |
| London | £95K–£130K | £80K–£135K | 10–15% | £125K–£185K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at GitHub are reimagining what software development looks like when AI is a first-class participant. In February 2026, the design challenge at GitHub is unprecedented: how do you design UX for an AI agent (Copilot Workspace) that autonomously plans, writes, and tests code? How do you build trust signals for AI-generated pull requests? How do you design the Copilot Extensions marketplace so developers can discover and compose AI tools seamlessly? These are novel interaction patterns with no established design language.

GitHub designers benefit from Microsoft's compensation structure while working on some of the most complex and novel AI UX problems in the industry. The role requires deep understanding of developer workflows, AI interaction patterns, and enterprise UX standards — a rare combination that commands premium comp.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub Designer = Microsoft Designer (L61-L63) = Google UX L4-L5 = Meta Product Designer IC4-IC5

### 🏗️ AI-Native UX Innovation Lever
Copilot Workspace fundamentally changes the GitHub design surface. Instead of designing static code review interfaces, designers must now create experiences where humans and AI collaborate in real-time — showing AI reasoning, enabling human oversight, building trust through transparency. In February 2026, GitHub's design team is pioneering the interaction patterns that will define AI-assisted development for the next decade.

This is a once-in-a-generation design challenge: you're defining the UX paradigm for how 100M+ developers work with AI agents. The design decisions made now will become industry standards.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI UX Pioneer Premium:** "Designing human-AI collaboration UX is an emerging discipline with very few experienced practitioners. My background in AI interaction design makes me one of a small number of designers who can immediately contribute to Copilot's UX challenges."
2. **Developer Empathy Depth:** "I understand developer workflows and can design for the unique mental models of software engineers — this domain expertise significantly reduces iteration cycles and improves product-market fit."
3. **Enterprise Design Credibility:** "Copilot Enterprise customers demand design quality and trust signals that consumer products don't require. My enterprise design experience directly addresses GitHub's highest-value customer segment."
4. **Design System Impact:** "I'll be contributing to and potentially leading the evolution of GitHub's design system (Primer) to support AI-native interactions — this is infrastructure-level design work with outsized impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Designing the UX for AI-native development is genuinely novel work, and I bring specific experience in human-AI interaction design that is extremely rare. I'm looking for an RSU grant of [X shares MSFT], roughly 20% above your current offer, which reflects the scarcity of this skillset. I'd accept at [Y shares], putting my total comp at $230K. Below that, I have alternatives in the AI design space that are more competitive." Target 20% above; expect counter at 10-12%; accept if total annual comp exceeds $225K.
