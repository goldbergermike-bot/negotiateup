| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $155K–$195K | $140K–$220K | 10–15% | $200K–$275K |
| Seattle | $150K–$190K | $135K–$215K | 10–15% | $195K–$270K |
| London | £95K–£130K | £85K–£140K | 10–15% | £130K–£190K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at GitHub build the data infrastructure that powers Copilot's intelligence and GitHub's product analytics. In February 2026, the data engineering challenge at GitHub is enormous: ingesting and processing billions of daily Copilot interaction events, building real-time pipelines for Copilot's feedback loop (which suggestions were accepted, modified, or rejected), and maintaining the data platform that serves GitHub's 100M+ developer analytics. This is petabyte-scale data engineering with direct AI product impact.

GitHub's data infrastructure runs on a hybrid of Azure-native services and open-source tools (Spark, Kafka, Databricks), leveraging Microsoft's Azure investment while maintaining the engineering flexibility GitHub needs. Data engineers who can operate at this scale while building reliable, low-latency pipelines for AI systems are in extremely high demand.

**Level Mapping:** GitHub DE = Microsoft Data Engineer (L61-L63) = Google DE L4-L5 = Meta DE IC4-IC5

### 🏗️ Copilot Data Platform Lever
Copilot's evolution into an agentic AI system (Copilot Workspace) dramatically increases GitHub's data engineering requirements. Each agent session generates complex telemetry — multi-step plans, code generation events, test results, human feedback — that must be captured, processed, and made available for model improvement and product analytics. In February 2026, GitHub is building the next generation of its data platform to support this agentic workload.

Additionally, the Copilot Metrics Dashboard (enterprise analytics) requires real-time data aggregation across thousands of organizations and millions of users. Data engineers are building the serving layer that makes this possible at GitHub's scale.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Data Pipeline Expertise:** "Building data pipelines for AI products — especially real-time feedback loops for LLM systems — requires specialized expertise that goes beyond traditional data engineering. My experience in this space directly addresses GitHub's most critical data infrastructure needs."
2. **Scale Credibility:** "GitHub's data platform processes billions of events daily across 100M+ developers. I bring experience operating at comparable scale, which means faster ramp-up and lower execution risk."
3. **Azure/OSS Hybrid Knowledge:** "GitHub's hybrid Azure/open-source data stack requires engineers who can navigate both worlds. My experience with [Spark/Kafka/Databricks/Azure] makes me immediately productive."
4. **Copilot Feedback Loop Impact:** "The data pipelines I'll build directly improve Copilot's suggestions — this is product-impacting infrastructure, not just analytics, and the comp should reflect that product proximity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "The data engineering work at GitHub is directly tied to Copilot's product quality — every pipeline I build makes AI suggestions better for 100M+ developers. I'm looking for an RSU grant of [X shares MSFT], about 18% above your current offer, reflecting the AI data engineering premium in today's market. I'd accept at [Y shares] with a $10K signing bonus to offset my transition costs. Below that, my alternatives offer more competitive packages." Target 18% above; expect counter at 10-12%; accept if total annual comp exceeds $230K.
