### Data Scientist | Vercel Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Edge-First Deployment Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI-Powered Product Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $170K–$220K | $140K–$270K | 5–10% | $225K–$340K |
| New York | $170K–$220K | $140K–$270K | 5–10% | $225K–$340K |
| London | £130K–£168K | £107K–£205K | 5–10% | £171K–£259K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Data Scientists at Vercel drive product and business decisions through rigorous analysis of platform usage, deployment patterns, developer behavior, and enterprise adoption metrics. At a company where the product is used by millions of developers, the data science function directly influences feature prioritization, pricing strategy, and growth experiments. You'll work with massive-scale web analytics data — from edge request patterns to framework adoption trends — and translate it into actionable product strategy.

Vercel's Data Science compensation reflects the company's emphasis on product-led growth: data scientists who can quantify developer experience improvements and tie them to enterprise conversion have outsized influence. Base salaries reach $220K for candidates with strong product analytics backgrounds, and equity grants are competitive with peer companies. The negotiation leverage for data scientists at Vercel comes from demonstrating that you can connect developer experience metrics to revenue outcomes — this is the analytical capability Vercel's leadership values most.

### AI-Powered Product Intelligence Lever
Vercel's 2026 data science agenda is centered on AI-powered product intelligence — using ML models to predict developer churn, optimize platform recommendations, personalize the developer experience, and provide AI-driven insights to enterprise customers. Data Scientists who combine traditional product analytics with ML modeling capabilities are exactly what Vercel needs to build its next-generation intelligence layer. If you can build predictive models alongside A/B testing frameworks, you hold a differentiated position.

Frame your negotiation around the AI-product intelligence premium: Vercel needs data scientists who go beyond dashboards to build ML-powered systems that make the platform smarter. This hybrid skillset — product analytics plus ML engineering — is scarcer than either skill alone, and commands a 10–20% premium.

**Global Levers**
1. **Product-Led Growth Expertise:** "I've driven product-led growth at scale — designing experiments, building propensity models, and quantifying feature impact on conversion and retention. That PLG expertise directly accelerates Vercel's enterprise revenue. I'm targeting $215K base and $260K equity/4yr."
2. **ML-Powered Analytics Premium:** "I build ML models that power product decisions — churn prediction, recommendation systems, and intelligent segmentation. This goes beyond traditional data science and into the AI-powered intelligence Vercel is building. I'm looking for $220K base."
3. **Developer Analytics Specialization:** "I have deep experience analyzing developer tools and platforms — understanding developer behavior, adoption funnels, and ecosystem dynamics. This domain expertise is rare and directly applicable. I want $215K base and $255K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Spread:** "Amplitude is offering $210K base with $240K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. I'm also considering a Meta E4 DS role at $200K / $260K RSU. Vercel's mission is where I want to apply my skills, but I need $215K base and $260K equity to make it work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm drawn to Vercel because the data problems here are genuinely unique — billions of edge requests, millions of developer interactions, and the challenge of quantifying developer experience at global scale. I'm holding an Amplitude offer at $210K / $240K RSU and a Meta DS offer at $200K / $260K RSU. Vercel's pre-IPO equity and the chance to build AI-powered product intelligence from scratch are compelling. I need $220K base, $265K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $220K, I commit immediately. My floor is $200K — below that, Meta's liquid equity package is too strong."
