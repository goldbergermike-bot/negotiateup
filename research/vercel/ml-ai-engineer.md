### ML/AI Engineer | Vercel Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** AI-Premium Base + Significant Pre-IPO Equity | Edge-First Deployment Pioneer | 2026 Focus: v0 & AI SDK Platform Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $195K–$260K | $200K–$400K | 5–10% | $295K–$450K |
| New York | $195K–$260K | $200K–$400K | 5–10% | $295K–$450K |
| London | £148K–£198K | £152K–£304K | 5–10% | £224K–£342K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Vercel build the intelligence layer behind the company's most strategic products — v0 (AI-powered UI generation), AI SDK (the framework for building AI applications), and AI-powered platform features like intelligent caching, predictive autoscaling, and deployment optimization. This is a rare ML engineering role where your models ship directly to millions of developers and power tools they use daily. Vercel's AI engineering is product-facing from day one: there's no research lab buffer between your work and users.

Vercel's ML/AI Engineer compensation reflects the extreme market premium for AI talent in 2026, combined with the company's pre-IPO equity upside. Base salaries reach $260K — competitive with dedicated AI companies — and equity grants of $200K–$400K represent significant ownership. The negotiation dynamic is highly favorable for AI engineers: Vercel is aggressively building its AI capabilities and competing for talent against Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and every AI startup. Use this competitive pressure to push base and equity toward the top of band.

**Level Mapping:** Vercel ML/AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta E4-E5 ML Engineer = Anthropic ML Engineer = OpenAI Research Engineer

### v0 & AI SDK Platform Intelligence Lever
Vercel's 2026 AI strategy centers on two products: v0 (which uses LLMs to generate production-quality UI code) and AI SDK (the open-source framework for building AI-powered applications). ML/AI Engineers working on these products are building the capabilities that Vercel's CEO has publicly identified as the company's future growth engine. If you bring experience with code generation models, LLM application frameworks, or AI developer tools, you're targeting Vercel's highest-investment product area.

Frame your negotiation around the v0/AI SDK strategic premium: these products represent Vercel's future revenue engine, and the engineers building them are the scarcest resource in the company. An ML engineer with both LLM expertise and developer tooling sensibility can push equity grants 20–30% above standard ranges because you're directly building Vercel's next $100M product line.

**Global Levers**
1. **LLM Application Expertise:** "I've built production LLM applications — from prompt engineering and model fine-tuning to inference optimization and evaluation pipelines. This is exactly what v0 and AI SDK need. I'm targeting $255K base and $380K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Developer Tooling Premium:** "I build AI tools that developers use — SDKs, frameworks, and APIs that abstract ML complexity. This developer-facing AI expertise is the exact intersection Vercel is hiring for. I want $260K base."
3. **Code Generation Model Experience:** "I have direct experience with code generation models — fine-tuning, evaluation, and production deployment. v0's core product is AI-powered code generation. I'm looking for $260K base, $390K equity/4yr, and a $50K signing bonus."
4. **AI Company Competing Offers:** "Anthropic is offering $240K base with $350K equity for ML Engineering. OpenAI is at $250K / $400K equity. Vercel's unique angle — applying AI to developer tools at scale — is what excites me, but I need $255K base and $385K equity to compete with pure-AI-company packages."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've spent my career at the intersection of ML engineering and developer tools — building LLM-powered products, code generation systems, and AI SDKs. I'm holding an Anthropic offer at $240K / $350K equity and an OpenAI offer at $250K / $400K equity. Both are compelling, but Vercel's vision of making AI a seamless part of every developer's workflow — through v0 and AI SDK — is the product vision I want to build. I need $260K base, $395K equity/4yr, and a $50K signing bonus. At $260K, I commit to Vercel and bring my LLM engineering expertise to the AI products that will define Vercel's next chapter. My floor is $240K — below that, the pure-AI companies' equity and research resources become the rational choice."
