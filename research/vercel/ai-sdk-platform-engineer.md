|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $210K–$275K | $280K–$500K | 5–10% | $340K–$530K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The AI SDK Platform Engineer is Vercel's signature role — the position that defines the company's AI-native future. You will build and maintain the Vercel AI SDK, the open-source framework that has become the industry standard for building AI-powered applications with JavaScript and TypeScript. This role sits at the intersection of framework design, LLM integration, and developer experience: you'll design the abstractions that make it trivial for millions of developers to add AI capabilities to their applications. Every API you design, every streaming pattern you implement, and every provider integration you build shapes how the entire JavaScript ecosystem interacts with AI. The +15-25% AI Platform Premium applies because this role requires a rare combination of deep framework engineering expertise, LLM infrastructure knowledge, and developer experience sensibility — and because the AI SDK is Vercel's highest-growth product line driving the company's next revenue milestone.

Vercel's CEO Guillermo Rauch has publicly positioned the AI SDK as core to Vercel's strategy: making AI a first-class citizen of the web development stack. AI SDK Platform Engineers are not just building a library; they're defining the standard interface between the web and AI. This strategic importance translates directly into compensation: base salaries reach $275K (competing with Anthropic and OpenAI for AI talent), and equity grants of $280K–$500K reflect the expectation that this role will be a primary driver of enterprise AI adoption on Vercel.

**Level Mapping:** Vercel AI SDK Platform Engineer = Google L5-L6 ML Platform Engineer = Meta E5-E6 AI Infrastructure Engineer = Anthropic SDK Engineer = OpenAI Platform Engineer

### AI SDK as Industry Standard Lever
In 2026, the Vercel AI SDK is the most widely adopted framework for building AI applications on the web — more Next.js applications use it for AI features than any other framework. AI SDK Platform Engineers are building the primitives that define how AI is consumed across the web: streaming interfaces, tool-calling patterns, multi-model orchestration, and agentic workflow abstractions. This role is defining an entirely new category of developer infrastructure, and the engineers building it are creating technology that will be foundational for a decade.

Negotiate from the position that you are building an industry-defining platform. The AI SDK's adoption metrics — millions of weekly downloads, thousands of enterprise integrations — make your work directly attributable to Vercel's enterprise revenue growth. Frame your compensation around this: you're not building a feature, you're building the interface layer between the web and AI that Vercel will monetize for years.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Framework Design Scarcity:** "There are perhaps 100 engineers in the world who can design production-quality AI SDK abstractions that work across LLM providers, handle streaming and tool-calling at scale, and still feel intuitive to a JavaScript developer. That extreme scarcity means compensation must reflect the market. I'm targeting $270K base and $480K equity/4yr."
2. **Open-Source AI Ecosystem Leadership:** "I've built and maintained open-source AI frameworks used by tens of thousands of developers. My track record of designing APIs that developers love and enterprises trust directly accelerates AI SDK adoption. I want $275K base with a $60K signing bonus."
3. **Multi-Provider LLM Integration Expertise:** "I have deep experience integrating with multiple LLM provider APIs — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, and open-source models. The AI SDK's value proposition is provider abstraction, and I bring the cross-provider expertise to make it best-in-class. I'm looking for $275K base, $490K equity/4yr."
4. **AI Company Competing Offers:** "Anthropic is offering me $260K base / $450K equity for their SDK engineering team. OpenAI Platform is at $265K / $480K equity. Vercel's AI SDK is the product I most want to build — it's the bridge between AI and every web developer — but I need $275K base and $495K equity to match the pure-AI company packages."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've dedicated my career to the intersection of developer frameworks and AI infrastructure — building the abstractions that make powerful technology accessible to every developer. The Vercel AI SDK is the product I've been preparing my entire career to build: the standard interface between the web and AI. I'm holding an Anthropic SDK offer at $260K / $450K equity and an OpenAI Platform offer at $265K / $480K equity. Both are strong — these are the companies building the AI. But Vercel is building how every developer uses the AI, and that's the layer I want to own. I need $275K base, $500K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $60K signing bonus. The AI Platform Premium applies — this role requires framework design mastery, LLM infrastructure depth, and DX intuition that almost no one has. At $275K, I commit to making the AI SDK the most important developer framework of the next decade. My floor is $250K — below that, the Anthropic and OpenAI packages, with their AI-first missions and competitive equity, become the rational choice."
