### Security Engineer | Vercel Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Security-Premium Base + Pre-IPO Equity | Edge-First Deployment Pioneer | 2026 Focus: AI Security & Edge Zero-Trust

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K–$240K | $160K–$300K | 5–10% | $260K–$385K |
| New York | $185K–$240K | $160K–$300K | 5–10% | $260K–$385K |
| London | £141K–£183K | £122K–£228K | 5–10% | £198K–£293K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Vercel protect the infrastructure that millions of developers trust to deploy their applications — from the edge network that serves enterprise production traffic to the build pipeline that processes untrusted code, and the platform's authentication, authorization, and secrets management systems. This is a uniquely high-stakes security role: Vercel's platform executes arbitrary customer code at the edge, making the attack surface fundamentally different from traditional cloud security. You'll design zero-trust architectures for serverless execution, build security controls for AI-powered features like v0, and ensure that Vercel meets the compliance requirements of enterprise customers (SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP).

Vercel's Security Engineer compensation reflects the critical nature of platform security for a company whose enterprise sales depend on trust. Base salaries reach $240K to compete with Big Tech security teams, and equity grants are competitive. The negotiation leverage for security engineers comes from the scarcity of candidates who understand both cloud-native security and the unique threat models of edge computing and serverless execution. If you can articulate security expertise specific to Vercel's architecture, you command premium compensation.

**Level Mapping:** Vercel Security Engineer = Google L4-L5 Security Engineer = Meta E4-E5 Security Engineer = Cloudflare Security Engineer = AWS Security Engineer

### AI Security & Edge Zero-Trust Lever
Vercel's 2026 security agenda includes two critical initiatives: securing AI-powered features (v0, AI SDK) against prompt injection, data leakage, and model manipulation; and building zero-trust security at the edge for enterprise customers with strict compliance requirements. Security Engineers who bring AI security expertise — understanding LLM vulnerability classes, AI supply chain risks, and secure AI deployment patterns — are the highest-priority security hires. This is an emerging specialty with very few experienced practitioners.

Frame your negotiation around the AI security premium: as Vercel embeds AI into every product surface, securing those AI features becomes existential. Security engineers with AI security expertise are commanding 15–25% premiums across the industry because the talent pool is so thin.

**Global Levers**
1. **Edge Security Specialization:** "I've built security architectures for edge computing and serverless platforms — the exact threat model Vercel faces. This isn't traditional cloud security; it requires deep understanding of code execution isolation, edge routing security, and multi-tenant protection. I'm targeting $235K base and $290K equity/4yr."
2. **AI Security Premium:** "I have direct experience securing AI systems — prompt injection defense, LLM output sanitization, AI supply chain security, and secure model deployment. As Vercel scales v0 and AI SDK, this expertise is critical. I want $240K base."
3. **Enterprise Compliance Expertise:** "I've led SOC 2, HIPAA, and FedRAMP compliance programs at cloud infrastructure companies. Vercel's enterprise sales depend on these certifications. I'm looking for $235K base and $285K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Spread:** "Cloudflare is offering $225K base with $260K RSU/4yr in liquid equity. AWS Security is at $220K / $280K RSU. Vercel's unique edge security challenges and pre-IPO upside are compelling, but I need $235K base and $290K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I specialize in securing the exact kind of infrastructure Vercel operates — edge computing, serverless execution, and AI-powered features. I'm holding a Cloudflare offer at $225K / $260K RSU and an AWS offer at $220K / $280K RSU. Vercel's security challenge is more interesting — protecting a platform that executes arbitrary code at the edge while securing AI features like v0 — and the pre-IPO equity adds upside. I need $240K base, $295K equity/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus. At $240K, I commit to building Vercel's security foundation. My floor is $220K — below that, the public-company packages are too strong."
