### Engineering Manager | Vercel Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Leadership-Premium Base + Significant Pre-IPO Equity | Edge-First Deployment Pioneer | 2026 Focus: Scaling AI-Native Engineering Teams

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $220K–$280K | $300K–$550K | 10–15% | $370K–$560K |
| New York | $220K–$280K | $300K–$550K | 10–15% | $370K–$560K |
| London | £168K–£213K | £228K–£418K | 10–15% | £282K–£426K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Vercel lead the teams building Next.js, Turbopack, the edge runtime, and the enterprise platform features that drive Vercel's revenue. This is a high-context EM role: you'll manage engineers who are open-source maintainers with massive community followings, navigate the tension between open-source community needs and enterprise customer requirements, and build the organizational infrastructure for a company transitioning from startup to scaled enterprise. Vercel EMs are expected to be technically deep enough to review architecture decisions while also scaling hiring, establishing engineering processes, and managing stakeholder relationships across product, design, and sales.

Compensation for Vercel EMs reflects the leadership premium and the scarcity of managers who can operate effectively in a high-velocity, open-source-driven engineering culture. Base salaries reach $280K to compete with Google M1 and Meta M1 packages, and equity grants at $300K–$550K provide meaningful ownership. The negotiation leverage at EM level comes from demonstrating that you can build and scale engineering teams in high-growth environments — Vercel's headcount is expanding rapidly, and managers who can hire, retain, and develop top talent are the constraint on growth.

**Level Mapping:** Vercel EM = Google M1 = Meta M1 = Netlify Director of Engineering = Cloudflare Engineering Manager

### Scaling AI-Native Engineering Teams Lever
Vercel's 2026 organizational challenge is building engineering teams optimized for AI-native product development — teams that blend frontend infrastructure expertise with AI/ML capabilities. Engineering Managers who have experience building and leading teams at the intersection of platform engineering and AI are Vercel's most critical leadership hire. If you've scaled engineering teams that ship AI-powered developer tools or managed the transition of product teams to AI-native workflows, you hold unique leverage.

Position yourself as a leader who understands both the technical and organizational challenges of building AI-native products. Managers who can recruit AI talent, establish AI-product development processes, and bridge the gap between ML research and production engineering command a 15–20% premium on equity grants.

**Global Levers**
1. **Team-Scaling Track Record:** "I've scaled engineering teams from 8 to 30+ while maintaining velocity and quality — exactly what Vercel needs in this growth phase. I'm targeting $275K base and $520K equity/4yr to reflect the organizational impact."
2. **Open-Source Leadership Experience:** "I've managed engineering teams with significant open-source responsibilities — balancing community engagement, contributor management, and enterprise feature delivery. That rare combination justifies $280K base."
3. **AI Team-Building Premium:** "I've built and led engineering teams that ship AI-powered products — recruiting ML talent, establishing AI development workflows, and bridging research-to-production. This is Vercel's highest organizational priority. I want $280K base and $540K equity/4yr."
4. **Big Tech Management Competing Offer:** "Google is offering M1 at $260K base with $450K RSU/4yr. Meta M1 is at $255K / $480K RSU. Vercel's mission and growth trajectory are more compelling, but I need $275K base, $520K equity, and a $60K signing bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've built and scaled engineering teams at high-growth companies through exactly this kind of inflection point — from startup velocity to enterprise reliability, from small teams to scaled organizations. I'm holding a Google M1 offer at $260K / $450K RSU and a Meta M1 at $255K / $480K RSU. Vercel's mission — making the web faster and AI-native — and the chance to build the engineering organization through this growth phase is the opportunity I want. I need $280K base, $540K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $60K signing bonus. At $280K, I'm ready to start building your team. My floor is $255K — below that, the Big Tech liquid equity packages are too strong to leave."
