**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Vercel are the technical bridge between the platform and enterprise customers — designing deployment architectures, leading proof-of-concept implementations, and ensuring that Fortune 500 engineering teams successfully adopt Next.js and the Vercel platform. This is a revenue-critical role: every enterprise deal depends on the SA's ability to demonstrate that Vercel can meet the customer's performance, security, and compliance requirements. You'll work with the largest engineering organizations in the world, translating their complex infrastructure needs into Vercel deployment strategies.

Vercel's SA compensation combines competitive base salaries with meaningful equity and performance bonuses tied to enterprise deal outcomes. Base salaries reach $225K, reflecting the technical depth and customer-facing expertise required. The negotiation angle for SAs centers on revenue attribution — every enterprise deal you influence directly impacts Vercel's ARR, making the variable compensation and equity components highly negotiable for candidates with strong enterprise track records.

### AI-Powered Enterprise Adoption Lever
Vercel's 2026 enterprise strategy includes AI-powered onboarding and migration tools — using LLMs to analyze customer codebases, generate migration plans, and automate the transition from legacy frameworks to Next.js. Solutions Architects who can leverage AI tools to accelerate enterprise adoption cycles are the most valuable SAs in the pipeline. If you can demonstrate experience using AI to streamline technical sales processes or build AI-powered migration tooling, you hold differentiated leverage.

Position yourself as an SA who can reduce enterprise time-to-value using AI — shorter proof-of-concept cycles, automated architecture recommendations, and AI-assisted codebase analysis. This efficiency directly translates to faster deal closures and higher enterprise conversion rates, justifying premium compensation.

**Global Levers**
1. **Enterprise Revenue Attribution:** "I've directly influenced $10M+ in enterprise ARR through technical sales engagements and architecture advisory. My ability to close enterprise deals justifies $220K base and $270K equity/4yr."
2. **Framework Migration Expertise:** "I've led large-scale enterprise migrations to modern web frameworks — exactly the customer journey Vercel's enterprise team facilitates. I'm targeting $225K base to match AWS and Google cloud SA offers."
3. **AI-Powered Enterprise Enablement:** "I leverage AI tools to accelerate enterprise adoption — automated codebase analysis, AI-generated migration plans, and intelligent architecture recommendations. This is Vercel's 2026 enterprise efficiency strategy. I want $225K base and $275K equity/4yr."
4. **Competing Offer Calibration:** "AWS is offering SA at $215K base with $250K RSU/4yr. Google Cloud is at $210K / $260K RSU. Vercel's enterprise growth trajectory and pre-IPO equity are compelling, but I need $220K base and $270K equity to close."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've spent my career helping enterprise engineering teams adopt modern web platforms — leading migrations, designing architectures, and closing technical evaluations. I'm holding an AWS SA offer at $215K / $250K RSU and a Google Cloud offer at $210K / $260K RSU. Vercel's enterprise growth story and the chance to shape how the world's largest companies build for the web are uniquely compelling. I need $225K base, $275K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $225K, I'm ready to start building Vercel's enterprise customer base. My floor is $205K — below that, AWS's liquid equity and established enterprise motion make the decision."
