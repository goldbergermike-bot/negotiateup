#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Recorded Future

Data Scientists at Recorded Future work on one of the most sophisticated applications of NLP in production — extracting structured intelligence (threat actors, malware, vulnerabilities, targets) from unstructured text across multiple languages and source types. The platform's $2.65B acquisition value is substantially built on these AI capabilities.

#### Lever 1: Production NLP at Scale

"Recorded Future's intelligence platform depends on NLP to extract entities and relationships from billions of data points. My experience deploying production NLP systems at scale directly supports this core capability."
