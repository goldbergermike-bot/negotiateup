#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Recorded Future

ML/AI Engineers at Recorded Future work on some of the most sophisticated NLP applications in production — extracting entities, relationships, and intelligence from multilingual, multi-source text at massive scale. Recorded Future's $2.65B acquisition by Mastercard was driven largely by these AI capabilities. The platform's NLP models must handle the adversarial nature of dark web content and the rapid evolution of threat terminology.

#### Lever 1: Production NLP at Intelligence Scale

"Recorded Future's NLP models process billions of data points across dozens of languages and source types. My production NLP expertise — entity extraction, relationship detection, and text classification at scale — directly powers the platform's core intelligence capabilities."

#### Lever 2: LLM and GenAI Integration

"Recorded Future is integrating LLMs to enhance intelligence analysis and delivery. My experience with LLM deployment, RAG systems, and AI-powered summarization accelerates this strategic initiative."

#### Lever 3: Multilingual Model Development

"Threat intelligence requires multilingual NLP. My experience developing and deploying models across multiple languages expands Recorded Future's intelligence coverage beyond English-language sources."

#### Lever 4: AI Talent Competition

"ML/AI engineers with NLP expertise are in extreme demand. I'm evaluating roles at [AI labs / Big Tech / other companies], and Recorded Future's offer must reflect the ML talent premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $180,000 base with equity/bonus valued at $60K-$85K/year. Accept-at floor: $245,000 total comp. Leverage NLP production expertise and the AI talent premium.
