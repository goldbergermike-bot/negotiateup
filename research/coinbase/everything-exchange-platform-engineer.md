#### Negotiation DNA

The Everything Exchange Platform Engineer is the signature engineering role at Coinbase — the engineer who builds the core platform that makes multi-asset trading possible. This is not a standard software engineering role with a crypto focus. This is the engineer who architects and builds the unified order matching, settlement, and clearing infrastructure that allows a single user to trade Bitcoin, buy Apple stock, and bet on an election outcome in the same session, on the same platform, with the same account. At the IC6-IC7 level, you are operating at the intersection of crypto settlement (real-time, irreversible), equities clearing (T+1, SEC-regulated), and prediction market resolution (event-driven, CFTC-regulated). The Everything Exchange — Coinbase's 2026 initiative — is the most ambitious product in the company's history, and this role sits at its technical center. Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) compensates Everything Exchange Platform Engineers with a 25-35% premium over standard engineering bands, reflecting the cross-domain expertise required and the strategic importance of the role. The $2B share buyback program protects RSU grants that represent $380K-$740K over four years. There is no comparable role at any other company — this is a category-defining position.

#### Everything Exchange — The $2B Buyback-Protected Equity

Coinbase's "Everything Exchange" is the company's most ambitious product expansion since its founding. In 2026, Coinbase is moving beyond crypto-only trading to offer stocks, crypto, and prediction markets on a single unified platform. This expansion dramatically increases Coinbase's total addressable market — from the $2T crypto market to the $100T+ global securities market.

For Everything Exchange Platform Engineers, the equity story is unmatched across the entire company:

- **You ARE the Everything Exchange:** This is not a supporting role. You are building the core infrastructure that makes multi-asset trading work. The unified order router, the cross-asset settlement engine, the multi-clearinghouse integration layer — these are the systems that define whether the Everything Exchange succeeds or fails. No other engineer at Coinbase has more direct impact on this initiative. Your RSU grant must reflect that you are building the product, not a component of it.
- **$2B Buyback at Maximum Leverage:** With $380K-$740K in RSUs — the highest grant range of any engineering role at Coinbase — the $2B buyback program is your most powerful compensation lever. At these RSU levels, a 15% buyback-driven price appreciation adds $57K-$111K to your 4-year grant value. The buyback is not just protection — it is a value multiplier at your grant size.
- **25-35% Everything Exchange Premium:** Your compensation includes a 25-35% premium over standard IC6-IC7 bands. This premium exists because the role demands expertise that spans three fundamentally different domains: crypto infrastructure (blockchain settlement, key management), traditional finance systems (FIX protocol, clearing corporations, T+1 settlement), and prediction market mechanics (event resolution, parimutuel pools). No other company requires this combination, which means no other company produces this talent. You are negotiating from extreme scarcity.
- **TAM Ownership:** You are building the platform that moves Coinbase from a $2T crypto TAM to a $100T+ global securities TAM. Every dollar of equities revenue, every prediction market fee, every cross-asset trading commission runs through the infrastructure you build. Your RSUs are tied to the largest TAM expansion in fintech history.
- **Negotiation Framing:** Position your entire compensation conversation as "I am the Everything Exchange. My infrastructure is the product. My RSU grant should be sized to the $100T TAM I am opening, with the 25-35% premium that reflects the cross-domain expertise no other company produces, protected by the $2B buyback that makes this equity the most structurally sound grant in fintech."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Signature Role Premium (25-35%):** "This is not a standard engineering role — it is the signature technical position at Coinbase. I am building the unified trading platform across three asset classes, each with different settlement, regulatory, and technical requirements. The 25-35% Everything Exchange premium is not a negotiation ask — it is the market rate for a role that does not exist at any other company. I need $700K+ in RSUs over 4 years and $315K+ base."

2. **Lever 2 — Cross-Domain Scarcity:** "There are perhaps 200 engineers in the industry who have production experience across crypto settlement, equities clearing, and event-driven market systems. I am one of them. This cross-domain expertise is the bottleneck for the Everything Exchange. Scarcity of this magnitude commands maximum RSU grants and base — I'm requesting the top of the IC6-IC7 band."

3. **Lever 3 — Buyback-Amplified Front-Loading:** "At $380K-$740K in RSUs with a $2B buyback protecting the price, front-loading my vest is the highest-leverage compensation optimization available. I'm requesting a 40/30/20/10 front-loaded schedule. At my RSU volume, front-loading captures $50K-$100K+ in additional value if COIN appreciates 20% post-Everything Exchange launch. This is not a perk — it is rational compensation design given the buyback."

4. **Lever 4 — No-Comparable-Offer Leverage:** "There is no comparable role at any other company. Stripe, Block, and Robinhood do not offer multi-asset platform engineering at this scope. The closest analog would be a Staff/Principal role at one of these companies at $480K-$550K TC, but without the Everything Exchange premium, the cross-domain scope, or the $2B buyback protection. I need $320K base and $720K+ RSUs to accept this role — and I am worth more than that, because no other engineer can deliver this."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $320K base and $720K RSUs (4yr). This is the signature role — negotiate accordingly. Anchor on the Everything Exchange premium — "I am building the core platform for a $100T TAM expansion. There is no comparable role at any other company." Do not benchmark against standard IC6 offers — benchmark against the opportunity cost of Coinbase not being able to ship the Everything Exchange. Push aggressively for front-loaded vesting (40/30/20/10) — at $720K in RSUs with a $2B buyback, front-loading adds six figures in expected value. Request a $100K-$120K signing bonus — you are leaving significant unvested equity at your current employer, and Coinbase needs you more than you need them. If base is capped at $298K, redirect entirely to RSU uplift — "If base is at $298K, I need $740K+ in RSUs. This role does not exist elsewhere, and my grant should reflect that." Use the fact that no other company has this role as your primary lever — there is no competing offer for a role that only Coinbase offers, which means Coinbase must pay whatever it takes to fill it. **Accept at $285K+ base and $500K+ RSUs (4yr).** Walk away below $278K base or $380K RSUs — at that floor, you can earn comparable total comp at Stripe or Block as a Staff/Principal without the cross-domain complexity, and Coinbase will have to explain to its board why the Everything Exchange is behind schedule because they would not pay market rate for the engineer who builds it.
