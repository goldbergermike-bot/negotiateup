#### Negotiation DNA

The Software Engineer role at Coinbase sits at the foundation of the "Everything Exchange" — Coinbase's 2026 initiative to expand from a crypto-only platform into a unified trading experience spanning stocks, crypto, and prediction markets. This is not a maintenance role. Engineers joining now are building greenfield systems that will process multi-asset order flows across regulatory jurisdictions. Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) offers a public-equity RSU structure with a 4-year vesting schedule, and the $2B share buyback program creates a price floor that protects your equity from short-term volatility. As an IC3-IC4 engineer, you are writing the code that will power the most ambitious product expansion in Coinbase's history.

#### Everything Exchange — The $2B Buyback-Protected Equity

Coinbase's "Everything Exchange" is the company's most ambitious product expansion since its founding. In 2026, Coinbase is moving beyond crypto-only trading to offer stocks, crypto, and prediction markets on a single unified platform. This expansion dramatically increases Coinbase's total addressable market — from the $2T crypto market to the $100T+ global securities market.

For Software Engineers, this means your RSUs are tied to a company entering a massive growth phase. The $2B share buyback program announced by Coinbase provides a structural floor for COIN stock. Here is why this matters for your negotiation:

- **Growth Upside:** The Everything Exchange positions Coinbase to capture revenue from equities, derivatives, and prediction markets — asset classes that generate billions in annual trading fees.
- **Downside Protection:** The $2B buyback means Coinbase is actively purchasing its own shares on the open market, reducing supply and supporting price. Your RSUs benefit from this price floor.
- **Negotiation Framing:** When negotiating RSU grants, frame your equity as "buyback-protected growth equity" — you get the upside of a company expanding into a $100T market with the downside protection of a $2B capital return program.

Request that your RSU grant be benchmarked to post-Everything Exchange projections, not legacy crypto-only revenue multiples.

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Everything Exchange Builder Premium:** "I'm not joining a crypto company — I'm joining the team building the first unified multi-asset trading platform. My offer should reflect the Everything Exchange scope, not legacy crypto-only comp bands. I'm requesting a 10-15% RSU uplift to reflect this expanded mandate."

2. **Lever 2 — Buyback-Protected Equity Acceleration:** "With the $2B buyback program protecting COIN's price floor, I'd like to discuss front-loading my RSU vest. A 1-year cliff with 25/25/25/25 vesting doesn't reflect the buyback-protected upside. I'm requesting a 33/33/17/17 front-loaded schedule."

3. **Lever 3 — Competing Offer Benchmark:** "I have a competing offer from Robinhood at $175K base with $350K RSUs over 4 years. Coinbase's Everything Exchange opportunity is more compelling, but the comp needs to be competitive. I need Coinbase to match or exceed the $262K annual total comp."

4. **Lever 4 — Signing Bonus for Equity Gap:** "My current employer's next vest is in 4 months. I'm leaving $45K in unvested equity on the table. I need a $50K signing bonus to bridge that gap and make the transition financially neutral."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $185K base and $350K RSUs (4yr). Anchor your ask on the Everything Exchange expansion — "I'm building multi-asset infrastructure, not maintaining a crypto exchange." Use a competing Robinhood or Kraken offer at $260K+ TC to create urgency. Push for a $40K-$50K signing bonus to cover unvested equity from your current role. If Coinbase counters below $175K base, pivot to RSU uplift — "If base is capped, I need $400K+ in RSUs to reach my floor." **Accept at $175K+ base and $300K+ RSUs (4yr).** Walk away below $165K base or $200K RSUs — at that point, Robinhood and Kraken are paying more for less scope.
