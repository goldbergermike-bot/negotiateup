### Data Engineer | American Express Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $190B market cap premium brand + Data powers card recommendations, fraud detection, and rewards + NYC HQ + Strong tech comp | AmEx data engineering drives the membership intelligence platform | **MEMBERSHIP DATA PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City (HQ) | $140K–$190K | $65K–$170K | 15–20% | $182K–$290K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at AmEx build the data infrastructure that powers cardmember analytics, fraud detection, merchant recommendations, and the rewards engine. AmEx processes over $1.5 trillion in annual spending data, creating one of the richest proprietary datasets in financial services. Data engineers build pipelines, streaming architectures, and data platforms that transform this transaction data into personalized experiences and risk models.

Compensation follows AmEx's hybrid model: competitive base plus RSU grants (4-year vest) plus bonus (15-20%). Data engineering compensation is competitive with Big Tech, particularly when NYC cost-of-living adjustments and AmEx's strong benefits are factored in.

**The Cardmember Data Premium**

AmEx's proprietary spending data -- covering $1.5T+ in annual volume across millions of merchants -- is among the most valuable commercial datasets in the world. Data engineers who build the infrastructure to leverage this data directly impact revenue through better recommendations, fraud prevention, and merchant analytics.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Snowflake/Databricks/Google] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to AmEx's data assets, but I need the RSU increased to $[target]."
2. **Data Platform Impact:** "The data platform I'd build powers $1.5T+ in transaction analytics. This justifies an RSU grant of $[target]."
3. **Cloud Data Expertise:** "My experience with [Spark/Kafka/cloud data platforms] commands $[X] at data companies."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A sign-on of $[30K-55K] would offset my unvested equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I have a competing offer at $[Z]K total comp. To choose AmEx, I'd need the RSU increased and a sign-on. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
