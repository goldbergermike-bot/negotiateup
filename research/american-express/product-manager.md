**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at AmEx own strategy for membership products including card benefits, rewards programs, merchant offers, and digital experiences. PM decisions directly impact card fee revenue ($7B+), cardmember spending volume ($1.5T+), and member retention. AmEx PMs operate in a data-driven culture with access to proprietary closed-loop transaction data.

**Level Mapping:** PM at AmEx (Director/VP) = L5-L6 at Google, IC5-IC6 at Meta, Sr PM-Principal PM at Amazon, SVP/Director at BofA, Director PM at Capital One

**The Membership Product Premium**

AmEx PMs manage some of the most iconic financial products in the world (Platinum Card, Gold Card, Centurion). Every product decision impacts the premium brand perception and billions in revenue. This scope of impact justifies premium PM compensation.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Stripe/Capital One] at $[X] total comp."
2. **Revenue Impact:** "Products I'd manage generate $[X]B+ in card fees and spending volume."
3. **Premium Product Expertise:** "My experience with [premium products/loyalty programs/payment products] commands $[X]."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A sign-on of $[38K-68K] would offset my unvested equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I have a competing offer at $[Z]K total comp. To choose AmEx, I'd need the RSU increased and a sign-on. Below $[floor], I'd need to reconsider."
