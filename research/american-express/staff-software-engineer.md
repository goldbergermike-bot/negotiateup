**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at AmEx (Principal or Distinguished Engineer titles) set technical direction for the payment network, membership platform, and merchant services. Staff SWEs have organization-wide influence and lead the most critical platform decisions. Compensation includes significant RSU grants, making total comp competitive with Big Tech Staff-level packages.

**The Premium Technology Leadership Premium**

Staff engineers at AmEx shape the technology strategy for a global payment network processing $1.5T+ annually. Their decisions impact payment reliability, network security, and the premium membership experience. This scope of technical leadership at a premium brand justifies top-of-market individual contributor compensation.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Meta/Stripe] at $[X] total comp."
2. **Technical Leadership Impact:** "Setting technical direction for a global payment network warrants Distinguished-level compensation."
3. **Platform Strategy:** "My leadership would shape systems processing $1.5T+ in transactions."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A sign-on of $[50K-90K] would offset my unvested equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I have a competing offer at $[W]K total comp. To choose AmEx, I'd need Distinguished-level RSU and a sign-on. Below $[floor], the competing offer wins."
