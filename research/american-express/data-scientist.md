### Data Scientist | American Express Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $190B market cap premium brand + DS drives credit decisions, fraud detection, and personalization + NYC HQ + Strong tech comp | AmEx DS has direct P&L impact through card decisioning | **CARDMEMBER ANALYTICS PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York City (HQ) | $148K–$202K | $72K–$185K | 15–20% | $195K–$315K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at AmEx build models that power credit underwriting, fraud detection (preventing billions in losses), cardmember personalization, and merchant analytics. AmEx's proprietary spending data and closed-loop network (where AmEx is both issuer and network) create unique DS challenges and advantages. DS compensation at AmEx runs 10-15% above SWE bands and is competitive with Big Tech and hedge fund DS roles.

**Level Mapping:** Data Scientist at AmEx (Senior/Principal) = L4-L5 at Google, IC4-IC5 at Meta, Applied Scientist at Amazon, VP/SVP at BofA, Senior DS at Capital One

**The Closed-Loop Network Data Premium**

AmEx's closed-loop network means the company sees both sides of every transaction (cardmember and merchant), creating a dataset that Visa and Mastercard lack. Data scientists who can leverage this unique data advantage to build better models have exceptional impact and negotiation leverage.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Two Sigma/Google/Capital One] at $[X] total comp."
2. **Credit Decisioning Impact:** "My models would directly impact credit decisions generating billions in revenue."
3. **Quantitative Expertise:** "My PhD/expertise in [credit risk/deep learning/causal inference] commands $[X] at quant funds."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A sign-on of $[35K-65K] would offset my unvested equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I have a competing offer at $[Z]K total comp. To choose AmEx, I'd need the RSU increased and a sign-on. Below $[floor], the competing offer is more compelling."
