**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at AmEx build models that power credit underwriting, fraud detection (preventing billions in losses), cardmember personalization, and merchant analytics. AmEx's proprietary spending data and closed-loop network (where AmEx is both issuer and network) create unique DS challenges and advantages. DS compensation at AmEx runs 10-15% above SWE bands and is competitive with Big Tech and hedge fund DS roles.

**Level Mapping:** Data Scientist at AmEx (Senior/Principal) = L4-L5 at Google, IC4-IC5 at Meta, Applied Scientist at Amazon, VP/SVP at BofA, Senior DS at Capital One

**The Closed-Loop Network Data Premium**

AmEx's closed-loop network means the company sees both sides of every transaction (cardmember and merchant), creating a dataset that Visa and Mastercard lack. Data scientists who can leverage this unique data advantage to build better models have exceptional impact and negotiation leverage.
