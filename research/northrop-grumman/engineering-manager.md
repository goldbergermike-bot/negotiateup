### Engineering Manager | Northrop Grumman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Traditional Defense + Tech Premium | $75B Market Cap | Space Systems/Defense | Standard 40-45 Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Falls Church, VA | $155K-$205K | $45K-$120K | 10-15% | $190K-$285K |
| Redondo Beach, CA | $160K-$210K | $45K-$120K | 10-15% | $195K-$290K |
| Huntsville, AL | $145K-$195K | $42K-$115K | 10-15% | $180K-$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Northrop lead teams building space systems, autonomous vehicles, missile defense systems, and intelligence platforms. Northrop EMs manage teams of 15-30 engineers on programs worth $100M-$1B+, balancing technical leadership, people management, and program execution. Unlike startup EMs, Northrop EMs operate within a mature organizational structure with defined career paths leading to Director, VP, and Sector President. EMs receive 10-15% bonus (higher than IC 10%), reflecting management responsibility. The biggest challenge: retaining cleared engineers against defense tech company poaching at 2x compensation. Each cleared engineer lost costs Northrop $200K+ in replacement costs. Effective retention management is the most valuable EM skill. [Source: Northrop EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Northrop EM = L3Harris EM = Lockheed EM -- Northrop pays competitively for management roles with space systems premium

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Program Delivery Accountability:** "I deliver programs worth $100M-$1B+ on time and within budget. This P&L accountability directly impacts Northrop's profitability."
- **Cleared Team Retention:** "I retain cleared engineers against defense tech companies offering 2x. Each retained engineer saves $200K+ in replacement costs."
- **Management Career Path:** "Northrop's management path (EM -> Director -> VP -> Sector President) offers a clear 20+ year career trajectory."

**Global Levers**

1. **Billion-Dollar Program Delivery:** "I manage teams delivering programs worth $100M-$1B+. My execution directly impacts Northrop's revenue and customer relationships."
2. **Cleared Team Retention Value:** "Retaining engineers against defense tech poaching is my primary challenge. My retention capability saves millions annually."
3. **Space Systems Management Premium:** "Managing space systems teams requires technical depth in spacecraft engineering. Space EM roles command a premium."
4. **Defense Peer Leverage:** "L3Harris, Raytheon, and Lockheed all actively recruit defense EMs. My competing offers provide clear market data."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage teams delivering $100M-$1B+ programs and retain cleared engineers against defense tech poaching. Each retained engineer saves $200K+. I'm targeting $200K base, $115K RSU, and confirmed 12% bonus. My competing EM offer from [L3Harris/Lockheed] is at $195K base. Space systems management and retention skills justify top-of-band." Accept at $185K+ base with $98K+ RSU.
