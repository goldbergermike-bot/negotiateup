**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Northrop define product strategy for space systems, autonomous vehicles, missile defense, and intelligence platforms. Defense PM at Northrop is heavily driven by DOD acquisition requirements, NASA mission needs, and government procurement processes. You work with capture teams to define product offerings that win competitive proposals, interface with DOD program offices on requirements, and manage product roadmaps aligned to government budget cycles. Northrop PMs must navigate both the technical complexity of space/defense systems and the procurement complexity of government acquisition -- a dual expertise that is rare and valuable. The product cycle is longer than consumer tech (3-10 years for space systems) but the revenue per product decision is massive ($500M-$10B per major program). [Source: Northrop PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Northrop PM = L3Harris PM = Lockheed PM -- defense PM with space systems complexity adds premium

- **Massive Revenue Impact:** "My product decisions drive $500M-$10B program captures. Each product choice has extraordinary revenue consequences."
- **Long-Cycle Strategic Impact:** "Space systems product decisions generate revenue for 10-20 years. My strategic choices have decades of impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **High-Revenue Product Decisions:** "My product strategy drives $500M-$10B program captures. Each decision has massive long-term revenue impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I define product strategy driving $500M-$10B program captures with 10-20 year revenue impact. My dual expertise in space systems technology and DOD acquisition is rare. I'm targeting $172K base, $82K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing PM offer from [Lockheed/L3Harris] is at $167K base." Accept at $162K+ base with $72K+ RSU.
