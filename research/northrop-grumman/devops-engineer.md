**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Northrop manage build, test, and deployment infrastructure for space systems, autonomous vehicles, and defense software. This includes satellite ground system operations infrastructure, classified development environments, spacecraft integration and test systems, and CI/CD pipelines for embedded real-time software. Northrop DevOps is fundamentally different from cloud DevOps: you manage infrastructure on classified networks, build systems for space-qualified software, hardware-in-the-loop test environments for spacecraft, and deployment to embedded processors on satellites and defense systems. Northrop is a leader in the DOD's DevSecOps initiative, modernizing development and deployment practices across defense programs. [Source: Northrop DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Northrop DevOps = L3Harris DevOps = Lockheed DevSecOps -- defense DevOps with space systems infrastructure complexity

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Space Systems Infrastructure:** "I manage satellite ground system infrastructure and spacecraft test environments. Space DevOps is a unique and specialized domain."
- **Classified DevSecOps:** "I manage development infrastructure on classified networks with defense compliance requirements."
- **DevSecOps Modernization Leader:** "Northrop is a DOD DevSecOps leader. My modernization work sets standards across the defense industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **Space Infrastructure Specialization:** "Satellite ground system operations and spacecraft test infrastructure are unique DevOps domains."
2. **DOD DevSecOps Leadership:** "Northrop is leading DOD DevSecOps adoption. My work influences industry-wide defense development practices."
3. **Classified Infrastructure Premium:** "Managing classified development infrastructure requires clearance and specialized skills."
4. **Defense Peer Leverage:** "Classified DevOps engineers are recruited across all primes and by defense tech companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage space systems infrastructure and classified development environments -- specialized DevOps that doesn't exist in commercial tech. Northrop's DOD DevSecOps leadership position makes my work industry-defining. I'm targeting $158K base, $74K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing offer from [L3Harris/Raytheon] is at $153K base." Accept at $148K+ base with $62K+ RSU.
