**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Northrop build data infrastructure for space systems, intelligence platforms, and defense analytics. You process satellite telemetry data, ISR sensor feeds, missile tracking data, and intelligence database systems. Northrop's data engineering spans both classified and unclassified environments, with significant work on space telemetry processing (downlink data from orbital assets), intelligence data fusion (combining multi-source intelligence), and autonomous vehicle data pipelines. Northrop is investing heavily in data infrastructure modernization -- replacing legacy systems with modern data platforms to improve analytics capabilities and AI readiness. Cleared data engineers with space/defense domain expertise are in high demand across the industry. [Source: Northrop DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Northrop DE = L3Harris DE = Lockheed DE -- Northrop pays slightly above defense average for data roles, reflecting modernization priority

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Space Telemetry Data:** "I process satellite telemetry and space system data -- a unique data engineering domain that doesn't exist in commercial tech."
- **Data Modernization Priority:** "Northrop's data infrastructure modernization is a strategic priority. My work transforms analytics capability across the company."
- **Cleared DE Scarcity:** "Cleared data engineers with space/defense expertise are extremely rare and recruited aggressively."

**Global Levers**

1. **Space Data Infrastructure:** "Satellite telemetry processing and space ground system data pipelines are unique, high-value data engineering domains."
2. **Data Modernization Impact:** "My modernization work improves analytics capability across programs worth billions."
3. **Cleared DE Premium:** "Cleared data engineers are scarce. Defense tech companies offer 2x for this skill set."
4. **Intelligence Data Fusion:** "Multi-source intelligence data fusion is a specialized domain with direct national security impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a cleared data engineer specializing in space telemetry and intelligence data systems -- skills that don't exist in commercial tech. Northrop's data modernization initiative makes my work a strategic priority. I'm targeting $162K base, $76K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing offer from [L3Harris/Palantir] is at $157K base." Accept at $152K+ base with $65K+ RSU.
