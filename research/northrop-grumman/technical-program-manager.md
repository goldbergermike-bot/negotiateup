### Technical Program Manager | Northrop Grumman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Traditional Defense + Program Delivery Premium | $75B Market Cap | Space/Defense Program Execution | Standard 40-45 Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Falls Church, VA | $125K-$178K | $28K-$88K | 10% | $152K-$238K |
| Redondo Beach, CA | $130K-$183K | $28K-$88K | 10% | $157K-$243K |
| Huntsville, AL | $118K-$168K | $26K-$83K | 10% | $145K-$228K |

**Negotiation DNA**

TPMs at Northrop manage the most complex defense programs in the world: national security space satellite constellations, the B-21 Raider stealth bomber, the Sentinel ICBM replacement program, and autonomous systems development. Northrop programs span decades-long lifecycles with budgets ranging from $500M to $100B+ (Sentinel is the largest ICBM program in history at $96B). TPMs coordinate across spacecraft manufacturing, software development, systems engineering, testing, launch operations, and on-orbit management. Defense program management at this scale follows DOD 5000 acquisition framework with rigorous EVM reporting, milestone reviews (PDR, CDR, TRR), and congressional oversight. The consequence of program failure is measured in national security impact. [Source: Northrop TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Northrop TPM = L3Harris TPM = Lockheed PM -- Northrop's space/nuclear programs represent the most complex defense program management

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Largest Defense Programs:** "I manage programs on the scale of Sentinel ($96B), B-21, and national security space. These are the largest defense programs in US history."
- **Multi-Decade Lifecycle:** "Space and nuclear programs span decades. My program management leadership has long-term impact on national security."
- **Congressional Oversight Management:** "I manage programs with direct congressional oversight and reporting. This level of accountability and visibility is unique."

**Global Levers**

1. **Largest Defense Programs:** "Northrop manages the largest defense programs in history (Sentinel, B-21). My program management operates at a scale that doesn't exist elsewhere."
2. **Space Program Complexity:** "Space satellite programs span manufacturing, launch, and decades of on-orbit operations. This is the most complex program management in defense."
3. **National Security Impact:** "Program delivery directly impacts national security capability. The consequence of failure is measured in strategic defense readiness."
4. **Defense Peer Leverage:** "Experienced defense TPMs are actively recruited by Lockheed, Raytheon, and defense tech companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage defense programs at a scale that doesn't exist outside of Northrop -- space systems, nuclear modernization, and stealth aircraft worth $500M-$100B+. The complexity of multi-decade, multi-domain defense program management with congressional oversight is unmatched. I'm targeting $175K base, $84K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing TPM offer from [Lockheed/L3Harris] is at $170K base." Accept at $165K+ base with $72K+ RSU.
