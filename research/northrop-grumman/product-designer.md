**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Northrop design interfaces for space systems ground stations, autonomous vehicle control systems, missile defense command centers, and intelligence analysis workstations. Defense design at Northrop is highly specialized: your interfaces must meet military human factors standards, work under extreme operational conditions, and support users making mission-critical decisions. You design satellite ground station interfaces where operators manage multi-billion-dollar spacecraft, drone control stations for autonomous surveillance aircraft, and missile defense displays where operators have seconds to make engagement decisions. Northrop's design team is growing as the company invests in modern UX for next-generation defense systems. [Source: Northrop Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Northrop Product Designer = L3Harris Designer = Lockheed HMI Engineer -- defense UI/UX with space systems complexity

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Mission-Critical Interface Design:** "My interfaces are used for mission-critical decisions -- satellite operations, drone control, missile defense. Bad UX has catastrophic consequences."
- **Military Human Factors:** "I design to MIL-STD-1472 and defense human factors standards. This specialized design knowledge is rare."
- **UX Modernization:** "Northrop is modernizing next-gen defense interfaces. My design work directly improves product competitiveness."

**Global Levers**

1. **Space Ground Station UX:** "I design interfaces where operators control multi-billion-dollar spacecraft. This is the highest-stakes interface design in the industry."
2. **Defense UX Specialization:** "Military human factors design is a rare and growing discipline. Few designers understand defense UX requirements."
3. **Modernization Impact:** "Modern interfaces are a competitive differentiator in defense proposals. My design work improves win rates."
4. **Defense Peer Leverage:** "Defense UX designers are recruited across primes and by defense tech companies."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I design mission-critical interfaces for space ground stations and defense command centers -- the highest-stakes UX in the industry. Defense UX specialization is rare and growing. I'm targeting $148K base, $56K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing offer from [L3Harris/Lockheed] is at $143K base." Accept at $138K+ base with $48K+ RSU.
