### ML/AI Engineer | Northrop Grumman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Traditional Defense + Tech Premium | $75B Market Cap | Space/Defense AI | Standard 40-45 Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Falls Church, VA | $130K-$180K | $32K-$95K | 10% | $158K-$245K |
| Redondo Beach, CA | $135K-$185K | $32K-$95K | 10% | $163K-$250K |
| Huntsville, AL | $120K-$170K | $30K-$90K | 10% | $148K-$235K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Northrop apply machine learning to the most consequential defense problems: autonomous target recognition from satellite imagery, AI-enabled missile tracking, autonomous drone navigation, and intelligent space systems management. Your models run on embedded hardware in satellites, autonomous aircraft, and ground-based defense systems -- not cloud servers. Northrop is investing heavily in "Autonomous Systems" and "Space-Based AI" as key growth areas, making ML/AI engineers a top recruitment priority. The company pays a 10-15% premium over standard defense SWE for ML roles, reflecting competition from FAANG, AI startups, and defense tech companies. Cleared ML engineers with space/defense deployment experience are the absolute scarcest talent in the defense market. [Source: Northrop ML Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Northrop ML/AI Eng = L3Harris ML Eng = Lockheed AI Eng -- Northrop pays 10-15% premium over defense SWE for ML, plus space systems premium

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Space AI Specialization:** "I deploy ML models on spacecraft and in space-based systems. Space-qualified AI is an emerging and rare domain."
- **Autonomous Systems ML:** "I build ML for autonomous drones and unmanned systems. Northrop's autonomous systems are a key growth area."
- **Cleared ML Engineer Scarcity:** "Cleared ML engineers are the scarcest talent in defense. FAANG and AI startups offer 2-3x compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **Space-Based AI:** "I deploy ML models in space systems -- satellite autonomy, space domain awareness, and on-orbit intelligence processing. This is the frontier of ML deployment."
2. **DOD AI Priority:** "AI-enabled defense is the DOD's top technology priority with 25%+ annual spending growth. My work is directly aligned with this investment."
3. **Cleared ML Maximum Scarcity:** "Cleared ML engineers willing to work in defense are the absolute scarcest talent. Maximum market leverage."
4. **FAANG/AI Competition:** "My competing offers from [FAANG/OpenAI/Anthropic] are 2-3x Northrop total comp. The stability premium should not be a 60% discount."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a cleared ML engineer deploying AI in space systems and autonomous vehicles -- the scarcest talent combination in the defense industry. FAANG and AI startups offer $300K-$400K. I'm choosing Northrop for the space mission and stability, but compensation should maximize within structure. I'm targeting $178K base, $90K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing defense AI offer from [L3Harris/Palantir] is at $172K base." Accept at $168K+ base with $78K+ RSU.
