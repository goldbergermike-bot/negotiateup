**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Northrop design how space systems and defense platforms integrate for military and intelligence customers. You architect satellite constellation deployments for DOD space programs, design ground system integration for intelligence agencies, and create autonomous vehicle deployment architectures for military branches. SAs are the technical bridge between Northrop engineering and DOD/intelligence customers -- your architecture proposals often determine whether Northrop wins or loses multi-billion-dollar contracts. Northrop SAs travel 30-50% to customer locations including Pentagon, intelligence agencies, Space Force installations, and military bases. The Falls Church/DC location is premium for SA roles due to proximity to DOD headquarters and intelligence community. [Source: Northrop SA Comp 2025-2026]
