### Security Engineer | Northrop Grumman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Traditional Defense + Clearance Premium | $75B Market Cap | Space/Defense Cybersecurity | Standard 40-45 Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Falls Church, VA | $120K-$172K | $28K-$85K | 10% | $145K-$228K |
| Redondo Beach, CA | $125K-$178K | $28K-$85K | 10% | $150K-$235K |
| Huntsville, AL | $112K-$162K | $26K-$80K | 10% | $138K-$218K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Northrop protect some of the most sensitive systems in the US defense infrastructure: national security space satellites, nuclear ICBM systems (Sentinel program), autonomous drone platforms, and classified intelligence systems. You manage cybersecurity for classified development environments across multiple security levels, protect spacecraft from cyber threats (a growing concern as space becomes a contested domain), ensure CMMC compliance across Northrop facilities, and defend against nation-state adversaries who actively target defense contractors. Northrop's breadth of classified programs means security engineers work across the full classification spectrum from CUI to TS/SCI/SAP. Space cybersecurity is an emerging discipline as adversaries develop capabilities to hack satellites and ground stations. [Source: Northrop Security Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Northrop Security Eng = L3Harris Security Eng = Lockheed Cyber Eng -- Northrop's nuclear and space programs add unique security complexity

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Nuclear Systems Security:** "I secure ICBM modernization systems (Sentinel program). Nuclear weapons security is the highest classification and consequence level."
- **Space Cybersecurity:** "I protect spacecraft from cyber threats -- an emerging domain as space becomes contested. Space cybersecurity expertise is extremely rare."
- **Multi-Classification Compliance:** "I manage security from CUI through TS/SCI/SAP. Multi-classification compliance is extraordinarily complex."

**Global Levers**

1. **Nuclear + Space Security:** "Securing nuclear weapons systems and national security spacecraft is the highest-consequence security work in defense."
2. **Space Cybersecurity Emerging Domain:** "Space cyber is a rapidly growing discipline. My early expertise in satellite and ground station security is increasingly valuable."
3. **CMMC Compliance = Contract Eligibility:** "Without CMMC compliance, Northrop can't bid on contracts. My compliance work enables billions in revenue."
4. **Cleared Security Maximum Scarcity:** "TS/SCI/SAP security engineers are the most aggressively recruited talent in defense."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I secure nuclear weapons systems and national security spacecraft -- the highest-consequence security work in the US defense infrastructure. Space cybersecurity is an emerging domain where my expertise is rare and growing in value. I'm targeting $170K base, $82K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing offer from [L3Harris/CrowdStrike] is at $165K base." Accept at $158K+ base with $70K+ RSU.
