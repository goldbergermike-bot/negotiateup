**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Northrop work on defense analytics problems spanning space systems, missile defense, autonomous vehicles, and intelligence analysis. You build models for satellite health prediction, missile trajectory estimation, autonomous navigation optimization, and intelligence pattern recognition. Northrop's data science domain is deeply specialized: orbital mechanics modeling, radar signal analysis, electro-optical image processing, and space weather prediction. The DOD's push for AI-enabled defense is creating strong demand for data scientists who can apply modern ML techniques to defense-specific data domains. Northrop pays a premium over standard defense DS roles for candidates with space systems or intelligence analytics backgrounds. [Source: Northrop DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Northrop DS = L3Harris DS = Lockheed DS -- Northrop pays a space/intelligence domain premium

**Culture & Work-Life Balance Negotiation**

- **Space Analytics Specialization:** "Orbital mechanics modeling, satellite health prediction, and space weather analysis are data science domains unique to the space industry."
- **DOD AI Investment:** "The DOD is investing heavily in AI-enabled defense. I'm at the forefront of applying modern ML to the most consequential problems."
- **Cleared DS Scarcity:** "Cleared data scientists with space/defense expertise are the scarcest analytical talent in the market."

**Global Levers**

1. **Space Data Science Domain:** "Orbital mechanics, satellite health, and space weather data science are unique to the space industry and extremely valuable."
2. **DOD AI Priority:** "AI-enabled defense is a top DOD priority with rapidly growing investment. My ML skills applied to defense have extraordinary leverage."
3. **Cleared DS Premium:** "Cleared data scientists are among the scarcest talent. FAANG and AI startups offer 2-3x but can't do classified work."
4. **Defense Tech Competition:** "Palantir, Anduril, and defense tech companies recruit cleared DSs aggressively."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a cleared data scientist with space/defense analytics expertise -- orbital mechanics, satellite health, and intelligence analysis. This domain specialization combined with clearance is extraordinarily rare. I'm targeting $162K base, $76K RSU, and confirmed 10% bonus. My competing offer from [L3Harris/Palantir] is at $157K base." Accept at $152K+ base with $65K+ RSU.
