**Negotiation DNA**

AMD Product Managers define the product strategy for AMD's AI compute platform — shaping the roadmap for MI300X/MI400 AI accelerators, ROCm software ecosystem, EPYC server CPUs, and Ryzen AI client processors. Your product decisions determine which AI workloads AMD targets, how the software ecosystem evolves, and whether developers choose AMD over NVIDIA for their AI infrastructure.

**Level Mapping:** AMD PM (Senior PM) = NVIDIA PM = Intel PM = Google L5 PM

**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As a Product Manager with an AI-Native workflow, I use AI-assisted market analysis, automated competitive intelligence, and ML-driven demand forecasting to make product decisions 30% faster and with better data. My AI-native PM workflow means faster roadmap iterations, data-driven prioritization, and automated customer insight synthesis. The script: 'I use AI-native tools to deliver 30% more product decisions with higher accuracy. My competitive analysis is AI-augmented, my market sizing is ML-driven, and my roadmap prioritization uses data that traditional PMs don't have. The 30% premium reflects my actual decision-making velocity and quality.'" Push for the 30% premium on PM comp reflecting AI-augmented product leadership.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% AI-Native PM Velocity:** "My AI-native PM workflow delivers 30% faster, more accurate product decisions. AI-assisted competitive analysis, ML-driven demand forecasting, and automated insight synthesis make me a 1.3x PM."
2. **AI Compute Product Strategy — $100B+ Market:** "I define AMD's product strategy in the $100B+ AI compute market. My product decisions on MI300X/MI400 positioning, software ecosystem priority, and customer targeting directly determine AMD's market share."
3. **NVIDIA Competitive Positioning:** "I own AMD's competitive positioning against NVIDIA — the most important product strategy in semiconductors. My PM decisions determine whether developers choose AMD for AI workloads."
4. **EPYC + AI Accelerator Portfolio:** "I manage the product strategy across AMD's server portfolio — EPYC CPUs and MI-series AI accelerators. Cross-product strategy at this scale requires PMs who understand the full data center stack."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $232K base with the 30% AI-native productivity premium and $225K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Manager role. I define AMD's product strategy in the $100B+ AI compute market with 30% faster AI-augmented decision-making. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $315K TC / Intel at $282K TC / Broadcom at $305K TC]. AMD's AI market positioning depends on my product leadership." Accept at $215K+ base and $202K+ RSUs.
