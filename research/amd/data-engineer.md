**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As a Data Engineer with an AI-Native workflow, I use AI-automated pipeline generation, ML-driven data quality validation, and AI-optimized query performance to deliver data infrastructure 30% faster. My AI-native data engineering means faster pipeline development, automated schema evolution, and ML-assisted performance tuning. The script: 'I deliver 30% more data infrastructure through AI-native tools. My pipelines are AI-generated, my data quality is ML-validated, and my query optimization is AI-assisted. The 30% premium reflects my actual data engineering velocity.'" Push for the 30% premium reflecting AI-accelerated data infrastructure delivery.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% AI-Native Data Velocity:** "My AI-native workflow delivers 30% faster data infrastructure. AI-generated pipelines, ML-validated quality, and AI-optimized performance make me a 1.3x data engineer."
2. **Silicon Performance Analytics:** "I build the data infrastructure that captures and analyzes silicon performance across AMD's entire product portfolio. My data pipelines inform the engineering decisions that determine chip competitiveness."
3. **Competitive Intelligence Data:** "I build the benchmarking and competitive intelligence data systems that inform AMD's strategy against NVIDIA and Intel. My data infrastructure is the foundation of AMD's competitive awareness."
4. **AI-Native Infrastructure Foundation:** "My data engineering provides the training data, feature stores, and analytics infrastructure that enables AMD's AI-native development workflows. I'm the data foundation of the 30% productivity advantage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $208K base with the 30% AI-native productivity premium and $165K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Engineer role. I build the data infrastructure enabling AMD's AI-native productivity advantage and competitive intelligence. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $265K TC / Intel at $242K TC / Broadcom at $258K TC]. AMD's analytical foundation depends on my AI-native data engineering." Accept at $195K+ base and $145K+ RSUs.
