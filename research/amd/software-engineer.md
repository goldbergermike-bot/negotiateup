### Software Engineer | AMD Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Semiconductor & AI Compute | AI-Native Workflow | **+30% AI PRODUCTIVITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $160K–$198K | $82K–$148K | 10–15% | $185K–$252K |
| Austin | $155K–$192K | $82K–$148K | 10–15% | $178K–$245K |
| Remote US | $148K–$185K | $82K–$148K | 10–15% | $172K–$238K |

**Negotiation DNA**

AMD Software Engineers build the software stack powering the world's fastest-growing AI compute platform — ROCm AI frameworks, GPU drivers, compiler toolchains, and the system software that enables MI300X/MI400 accelerators to compete with NVIDIA for AI training and inference workloads. AMD's AI GPU revenue grew from near-zero to $5B+ in two years, and your software engineering determines whether AMD captures the next $20B+ in AI compute demand. [Source: AMD SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** AMD SWE (SMTS) = NVIDIA SWE = Intel Grade 7 = Google L3 = Broadcom IC2

**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As a Software Engineer with an AI-Native workflow, I deliver 30% more output than engineers at traditional semiconductor companies. My AI-assisted development means faster code generation, automated testing, and ML-optimized performance tuning. I'm not negotiating as a standard SWE — I'm a 1.3x engineer. My comp should reflect a 30% productivity premium because AMD gets 30% more engineering output from me than a competitor would. The script: 'I use AMD's AI-Native workflow to deliver 30% higher productivity. My ROCm development uses AI-assisted coding, automated regression testing, and ML-driven performance optimization. I produce the output of 1.3 engineers — my salary should reflect 1.3x the standard band. The 30% premium is not a raise, it's accurate pricing for my actual output.'" Push for the full 30% productivity premium on base salary.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% AI-Native Productivity Premium:** "I use AMD's AI-Native workflow — AI-assisted coding, automated testing, ML-optimized development. I deliver 30% more output than traditional engineers. My comp should price my actual productivity, not a standard band."
2. **AI GPU Software Stack — $5B+ Revenue:** "I build the ROCm software stack enabling AMD's AI GPU revenue — from near-zero to $5B+ in two years. My software determines whether developers choose AMD over NVIDIA for AI workloads."
3. **MI300X/MI400 Platform Software:** "I develop the drivers, compilers, and frameworks for AMD's AI accelerators. My software quality directly determines whether AMD captures market share from NVIDIA in the $100B+ AI compute market."
4. **NVIDIA Competitive Talent Premium:** "AMD competes directly with NVIDIA for software talent. NVIDIA SWEs earn $260K+ TC. AMD must pay competitively to attract the GPU software engineers who determine the AI compute platform war."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $195K base with the 30% AI-Native productivity premium and $145K RSUs over 4 years for this Software Engineer role. I use AMD's AI-Native workflow to deliver 30% more output — I'm pricing my actual productivity, not a standard band. I build the ROCm stack driving AMD's $5B+ AI GPU revenue. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $258K TC / Intel at $248K TC / Broadcom at $242K TC]. AMD needs top GPU software talent to win the AI compute war." Accept at $182K+ base and $128K+ RSUs.
