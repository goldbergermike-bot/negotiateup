### Product Designer | AMD Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Semiconductor & AI Compute | AI-Native Workflow | **+30% AI PRODUCTIVITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $148K–$188K | $68K–$122K | 10–15% | $168K–$232K |
| Austin | $142K–$182K | $68K–$122K | 10–15% | $162K–$225K |
| Remote US | $138K–$175K | $68K–$122K | 10–15% | $155K–$218K |

**Negotiation DNA**

AMD Product Designers shape the developer experience for AMD's AI compute ecosystem — designing ROCm developer portals, GPU profiling tools, AI model deployment interfaces, and the documentation and visualization systems that determine whether developers can effectively use AMD hardware for AI workloads. Your design decisions on developer tooling UX directly influence developer adoption — the most important battleground against NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem. [Source: AMD Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** AMD Product Designer (MTS) = NVIDIA UX = Intel UX Designer = Google L4 UX

**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As a Product Designer with an AI-Native workflow, I use AI-generated prototypes, automated user research synthesis, and ML-driven UX analytics to deliver design iterations 30% faster. My AI-assisted design process means faster wireframing, data-driven design decisions, and automated accessibility validation. The script: 'I deliver 30% more design output through AI-native tools — AI-generated prototypes, automated research synthesis, and ML-driven UX optimization. The 30% premium reflects my actual design velocity and the AI-augmented quality of my developer experience work.'" Push for the 30% premium on design comp reflecting AI-assisted output.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% AI-Native Design Velocity:** "My AI-native design workflow delivers 30% faster iterations. AI-generated prototypes, automated UX analysis, and ML-driven design decisions make me a 1.3x designer."
2. **Developer Experience — CUDA vs ROCm:** "I design the developer experience that competes with NVIDIA's CUDA. Developer UX determines whether engineers choose AMD — my design work is the front line of the AI compute platform war."
3. **AI Tooling UX — Developer Adoption:** "My design work on GPU profiling tools, AI model deployment interfaces, and developer portals directly determines AMD's developer adoption rate — the key metric for ecosystem growth."
4. **Semiconductor Design Scarcity:** "UX designers with semiconductor domain expertise are extremely rare. I combine design skills with deep understanding of GPU architecture, developer workflows, and AI compute tooling."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $185K base with the 30% AI-native productivity premium and $118K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Designer role. I design the developer experience competing with NVIDIA's CUDA — the front line of AMD's platform war. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $228K TC / Intel at $218K TC / Google at $235K TC]. AMD's developer adoption depends on my UX design." Accept at $172K+ base and $102K+ RSUs.
