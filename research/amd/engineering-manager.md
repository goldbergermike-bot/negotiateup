### Engineering Manager | AMD Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Semiconductor & AI Compute | AI-Native Workflow | **+30% AI PRODUCTIVITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $218K–$268K | $192K–$338K | 15–20% | $288K–$402K |
| Austin | $212K–$262K | $192K–$338K | 15–20% | $282K–$395K |
| Remote US | $205K–$255K | $192K–$338K | 15–20% | $275K–$388K |

**Negotiation DNA**

AMD Engineering Managers lead the teams building AMD's AI compute software and hardware platforms — owning team velocity, hiring pipeline, and technical delivery for ROCm frameworks, GPU drivers, AI accelerator software, and the system-level engineering that enables MI300X/MI400 to compete with NVIDIA's dominant ecosystem. At EM level, you control the team output that determines AMD's pace in the AI compute race. [Source: AMD EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** AMD EM (Senior Manager) = NVIDIA EM = Intel Grade 9 EM = Google L5 EM

**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As an Engineering Manager, my AI-Native team delivers 30% higher velocity than traditionally-managed teams. I hire, train, and manage engineers who use AI-native workflows to deliver 1.3x output per person. My team of 8 produces the output of a team of 10 at traditional companies. The script: 'My team uses AMD's AI-Native workflow to deliver 30% more output. When you evaluate my EM comp, don't price me for managing 8 engineers — price me for the output of 10. My AI-native team management is a force multiplier that justifies a 30% productivity premium on my comp, and my hiring pipeline brings in engineers who operate at the same 1.3x velocity.'" Push for EM comp that reflects team-level AI-native productivity multiplier.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% AI-Native Premium — Team Multiplier:** "My team delivers 1.3x output through AI-native workflows. I manage 8 engineers producing the output of 10. My EM comp should reflect the team-level productivity multiplier, not headcount."
2. **AI Compute Talent Pipeline:** "I own the hiring pipeline for AMD's AI software teams. Recruiting GPU software engineers from NVIDIA, Google, and Meta requires an EM who understands the talent market and can sell AMD's AI vision."
3. **Cross-Functional AI Platform Delivery:** "I coordinate with hardware, firmware, and product teams to ship AMD's AI compute platform. My cross-functional leadership determines how fast MI300X/MI400 features reach customers."
4. **NVIDIA EM Parity:** "NVIDIA EMs earn $400K+ TC. AMD must match to retain the engineering leaders building the competitive AI platform. My NVIDIA competing offer establishes the EM floor."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $265K base with the 30% AI-native team multiplier and $332K RSUs over 4 years for this Engineering Manager role. My team delivers 1.3x output — 8 engineers producing the output of 10. I lead the AI compute software teams determining AMD's competitiveness against NVIDIA. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $398K TC / Intel at $355K TC / Broadcom at $388K TC]. AMD's AI platform war requires NVIDIA-competitive EM comp." Accept at $248K+ base and $298K+ RSUs.
