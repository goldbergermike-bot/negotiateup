### Data Scientist | AMD Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Semiconductor & AI Compute | AI-Native Workflow | **+30% AI PRODUCTIVITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $178K–$222K | $108K–$195K | 10–15% | $208K–$288K |
| Austin | $172K–$215K | $108K–$195K | 10–15% | $202K–$282K |
| Remote US | $165K–$208K | $108K–$195K | 10–15% | $195K–$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

AMD Data Scientists analyze the performance, market dynamics, and competitive positioning of AMD's AI compute platform — benchmarking MI300X/MI400 against NVIDIA, modeling AI workload demand, optimizing pricing strategy, and providing the data-driven insights that inform AMD's product roadmap. Your analytics directly influence the product and go-to-market decisions that determine AMD's share of the $100B+ AI compute market. [Source: AMD DS Comp 2025-2026]

**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As a Data Scientist with an AI-Native workflow, I use AI-automated analysis pipelines, ML-driven hypothesis generation, and AI-assisted data visualization to deliver insights 30% faster. My AI-native analytics workflow means faster competitive analysis, automated benchmark interpretation, and ML-driven demand forecasting. The script: 'I deliver 30% more analytical output through AI-native tools. My competitive benchmarking, demand modeling, and pricing analysis are AI-accelerated. The 30% premium reflects my actual insight-delivery velocity.'" Push for the 30% premium reflecting AI-augmented analytical output.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% AI-Native Analytics Velocity:** "My AI-native workflow delivers 30% faster insights. AI-automated analysis, ML-driven forecasting, and AI-assisted visualization make me a 1.3x data scientist."
2. **AI Compute Market Intelligence:** "I provide the market intelligence that informs AMD's AI strategy — benchmarking against NVIDIA, modeling workload demand, and forecasting market shifts. My analytics directly shape $B+ product decisions."
3. **Performance Benchmarking — Competitive Weapon:** "My benchmark analysis determines how AMD positions MI300X/MI400 against NVIDIA. Performance data is the most important competitive asset in AI compute — my analysis shapes the narrative."
4. **Pricing & Revenue Optimization:** "I model pricing strategy across AMD's AI compute portfolio. My data science on pricing elasticity and competitive dynamics directly optimizes AMD's AI revenue per chip."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base with the 30% AI-native productivity premium and $192K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Scientist role. I deliver AI-accelerated market intelligence for AMD's $100B+ AI compute opportunity. My benchmarking and demand modeling directly inform $B+ product decisions. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $285K TC / Intel at $258K TC / Broadcom at $275K TC]. AMD's AI strategy depends on my analytical velocity." Accept at $202K+ base and $168K+ RSUs.
