### Technical Program Manager | AMD Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Semiconductor & AI Compute | AI-Native Workflow | **+30% AI PRODUCTIVITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $168K–$212K | $88K–$162K | 10–15% | $195K–$262K |
| Austin | $162K–$205K | $88K–$162K | 10–15% | $188K–$255K |
| Remote US | $155K–$198K | $88K–$162K | 10–15% | $182K–$248K |

**Negotiation DNA**

AMD TPMs coordinate the cross-functional programs that drive AMD's AI compute platform — MI300X/MI400 launch timelines, ROCm release schedules, customer qualification programs, and the silicon-software co-development that synchronizes hardware and software delivery. Your program management determines how fast AMD ships competitive AI products and how effectively hardware and software teams execute in parallel. [Source: AMD TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** AMD TPM (SMTS) = NVIDIA TPM = Intel TPM = Google L4 TPM

**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As a TPM with an AI-Native workflow, I use AI-automated schedule tracking, ML-driven risk prediction, and AI-assisted cross-team coordination to manage programs 30% more efficiently. My AI-native program management means earlier risk detection, automated dependency tracking, and ML-predicted schedule impacts. The script: 'I manage AMD's most critical programs at 1.3x velocity through AI-native tools. My AI-automated risk prediction catches issues weeks earlier. My ML-driven dependency tracking eliminates manual coordination overhead. The 30% premium reflects my actual program throughput.'" Push for the 30% premium on TPM comp reflecting AI-accelerated program management.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% AI-Native Program Velocity:** "My AI-native workflow delivers 30% faster program management. AI-automated risk detection, ML-driven scheduling, and automated dependency tracking make me a 1.3x TPM."
2. **Silicon-Software Co-Development:** "I coordinate the most complex program challenge in semis — synchronizing hardware silicon development with software stack delivery. MI300X/MI400 success depends on this coordination."
3. **AI Accelerator Launch Programs:** "I manage the launch programs for AMD's AI accelerators — from silicon bring-up through software readiness to customer qualification. Each launch timeline directly impacts AMD's competitive window."
4. **Customer Qualification Programs:** "I manage the qualification programs with hyperscalers and enterprise customers. Faster qualification means faster revenue recognition — my program velocity converts directly to revenue timing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $208K base with the 30% AI-native productivity premium and $158K RSUs over 4 years for this TPM role. I manage AMD's AI accelerator programs at 1.3x velocity — coordinating silicon-software delivery and customer qualification. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $258K TC / Intel at $238K TC / Broadcom at $255K TC]. AMD's AI launch timing depends on my program velocity." Accept at $195K+ base and $138K+ RSUs.
