### Security Engineer | AMD Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Semiconductor & AI Compute | AI-Native Workflow | **+30% AI PRODUCTIVITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $188K–$235K | $118K–$212K | 10–15% | $222K–$308K |
| Austin | $182K–$228K | $118K–$212K | 10–15% | $215K–$302K |
| Remote US | $175K–$222K | $118K–$212K | 10–15% | $208K–$295K |

**Negotiation DNA**

AMD Security Engineers protect the silicon and software security of AMD's entire compute platform — hardware root of trust, secure boot chains, side-channel attack mitigation, firmware security, and the AI accelerator security that determines whether enterprises trust AMD hardware for sensitive AI workloads. Your security work protects against vulnerabilities that could affect billions of deployed AMD processors — a Spectre/Meltdown-class vulnerability would cost AMD billions in market cap.

**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As a Security Engineer with an AI-Native workflow, I use AI-assisted vulnerability scanning, ML-driven threat modeling, and automated security validation to deliver security engineering 30% faster. My AI-native security workflow means faster vulnerability detection, automated firmware analysis, and ML-predicted attack surface mapping. The script: 'I deliver 30% more security coverage through AI-native tools. My vulnerability scanning is AI-augmented, my threat models are ML-driven, and my firmware security validation is automated. The 30% premium reflects my actual security throughput — critical when protecting billions of deployed processors.'" Push for the 30% premium on security comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% AI-Native Security Velocity:** "My AI-native workflow delivers 30% faster security engineering. AI-augmented vulnerability scanning, ML-driven threat modeling, and automated validation make me a 1.3x security engineer."
2. **Billions of Deployed Processors:** "My security work protects billions of AMD processors in deployment. A single vulnerability like Spectre/Meltdown could cost AMD billions — my security engineering is the insurance on AMD's market cap."
3. **AI Accelerator Security — Enterprise Trust:** "Enterprise customers require security certifications for AI workloads handling sensitive data. My security engineering on MI300X/MI400 directly determines whether enterprises trust AMD for AI."
4. **Hardware Root of Trust:** "I design AMD's hardware security architecture — secure boot, TPM, memory encryption. My hardware security foundations protect every AMD system deployed worldwide."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $232K base with the 30% AI-native productivity premium and $208K RSUs over 4 years for this Security Engineer role. I protect billions of deployed AMD processors with 30% faster AI-native security engineering. A vulnerability costs AMD billions — I'm the insurance. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $305K TC / Intel at $278K TC / Broadcom at $298K TC]. AMD's security posture depends on my AI-augmented engineering." Accept at $215K+ base and $185K+ RSUs.
