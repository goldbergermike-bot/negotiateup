### Senior Software Engineer | AMD Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Semiconductor & AI Compute | AI-Native Workflow | **+30% AI PRODUCTIVITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $198K–$248K | $148K–$268K | 10–15% | $245K–$342K |
| Austin | $192K–$242K | $148K–$268K | 10–15% | $238K–$335K |
| Remote US | $185K–$235K | $148K–$268K | 10–15% | $232K–$328K |

**Negotiation DNA**

AMD Senior Software Engineers own the technical architecture of the AI compute software stack — ROCm framework design, GPU compiler optimization, driver architecture, and the performance engineering that determines whether MI300X/MI400 can match or exceed NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem for AI training and inference. At senior level, your architectural decisions directly determine AMD's competitive position in the $100B+ AI compute market. [Source: AMD Sr SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As a Senior Software Engineer with an AI-Native workflow, I deliver 30% more architectural output than senior engineers at traditional semiconductor companies. My AI-assisted development means faster design iteration, automated regression suites, and ML-driven performance analysis. At senior level, the 30% premium compounds — my architectural decisions have broader impact, and AI-native velocity means I ship those decisions faster. The script: 'I'm a senior engineer delivering 1.3x output through AMD's AI-Native workflow. My architectural work on ROCm and GPU compilers determines AMD's AI competitiveness. Pricing me at standard bands means AMD is paying 1.0x for 1.3x output — the 30% premium correctly prices my actual productivity at the senior level where architectural velocity matters most.'" Push for the full 30% premium at senior level where it has the most leverage.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% AI-Native Productivity Premium — Senior Leverage:** "At senior level, my AI-Native 30% premium compounds — AI-assisted architecture iteration and automated testing mean I ship senior-level decisions 30% faster. My comp should reflect 1.3x senior output."
2. **ROCm Architecture — CUDA Challenger:** "I architect the ROCm framework that challenges NVIDIA's CUDA dominance. My architectural decisions determine whether AMD's AI software ecosystem attracts developers — the decisive factor in the AI compute war."
3. **MI300X/MI400 Performance Engineering:** "My senior-level performance optimization directly determines benchmark results that influence $B+ purchasing decisions. Every percentage of performance I squeeze from the hardware converts to market share."
4. **NVIDIA Competitive Premium — Senior Level:** "NVIDIA senior SWEs earn $350K+ TC. AMD must match this to attract senior GPU software architects. My competing NVIDIA offer establishes the floor."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base with the 30% AI-Native productivity premium and $262K RSUs over 4 years for this Senior Software Engineer role. I deliver 1.3x senior output through AI-native workflows. My ROCm architecture determines AMD's competitiveness against NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem in the $100B+ AI compute market. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $348K TC / Intel at $298K TC / Broadcom at $325K TC]. AMD's AI revenue depends on my senior software architecture." Accept at $228K+ base and $235K+ RSUs.
