**Negotiation DNA**

AMD Solutions Architects design the technical reference architectures that enable enterprise and hyperscaler customers to deploy AMD AI accelerators and EPYC servers at scale — performance optimization frameworks, workload-specific configurations, and the technical blueprints that convert evaluation wins into production deployments worth millions. Your architecture directly determines whether customers choose AMD over NVIDIA for their AI infrastructure. [Source: AMD SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** AMD Solutions Architect (MTS) = NVIDIA SA = Intel SA = Google L4-L5 SA

**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As a Solutions Architect with an AI-Native workflow, I use AI-assisted architecture design, automated performance modeling, and ML-driven workload optimization to deliver reference architectures 30% faster. My AI-native SA workflow means faster customer engagements, automated benchmark configurations, and AI-optimized deployment blueprints. The script: 'I deliver 30% more customer-facing architecture work through AI-native tools. My reference architectures, performance models, and deployment blueprints are AI-accelerated — turning customer evaluations into production deployments 30% faster.'" Push for the 30% premium reflecting AI-accelerated customer enablement.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% AI-Native SA Velocity:** "My AI-native workflow delivers 30% faster customer engagements. AI-assisted architecture, automated benchmarking, and ML-driven optimization accelerate evaluation-to-deployment conversion."
2. **Customer Win Architecture:** "I design the reference architectures that convert enterprise evaluations into AMD deployments. Each customer win I enable is worth $1M-$100M+ in hardware revenue."
3. **NVIDIA Displacement Strategy:** "I architect the technical solutions that displace NVIDIA in customer data centers. My SA work directly converts NVIDIA install base to AMD revenue."
4. **Hyperscaler AI Infrastructure:** "I design AMD AI compute architectures for the largest hyperscalers — cloud providers deploying thousands of MI300X/MI400 accelerators. These engagements represent AMD's highest-value customer relationships."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base with the 30% AI-native productivity premium and $185K RSUs over 4 years for this Solutions Architect role. I deliver customer-facing architecture 30% faster through AI-native tools. My reference architectures convert enterprise evaluations into $M+ AMD deployments. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $285K TC / Intel at $258K TC / Broadcom at $278K TC]. AMD's customer wins depend on my SA velocity." Accept at $202K+ base and $162K+ RSUs.
