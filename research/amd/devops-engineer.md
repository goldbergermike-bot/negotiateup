### DevOps Engineer | AMD Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Semiconductor & AI Compute | AI-Native Workflow | **+30% AI PRODUCTIVITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $168K–$212K | $92K–$168K | 10–15% | $195K–$268K |
| Austin | $162K–$205K | $92K–$168K | 10–15% | $188K–$262K |
| Remote US | $155K–$198K | $92K–$168K | 10–15% | $182K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

AMD DevOps Engineers own the infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines for AMD's software development ecosystem — GPU driver build systems, ROCm release pipelines, automated testing infrastructure, and the development environment that enables AMD's 30% AI-native productivity advantage. Your DevOps work directly determines how fast AMD ships software updates that improve AI accelerator performance and developer experience. [Source: AMD DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As a DevOps Engineer, I BUILD the AI-native infrastructure that enables AMD's 30% productivity advantage. I'm not just a beneficiary of AI-native workflows — I'm the architect of them. My AI-powered CI/CD, automated testing, and ML-driven deployment optimization ARE the infrastructure that makes every AMD engineer 30% more productive. The script: 'I build the AI-native development infrastructure that gives AMD its 30% productivity edge. My CI/CD pipelines use ML-driven test selection, AI-optimized build scheduling, and automated performance regression detection. The 30% premium applies to me because I enable the productivity multiplier for the entire engineering org.'" Push for the 30% premium as the DevOps engineer who ENABLES the AI-native advantage.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% AI-Native Infrastructure Architect:** "I build the AI-native CI/CD infrastructure that enables AMD's 30% productivity advantage. My DevOps work is the force multiplier for the entire engineering org. The premium reflects my org-wide impact."
2. **GPU Software Release Velocity:** "I own the release pipeline for ROCm and GPU drivers. How fast AMD ships software updates directly determines competitive responsiveness against NVIDIA. My pipeline velocity is AMD's software speed."
3. **Automated Testing Infrastructure:** "I build the automated testing infrastructure for AMD's GPU software — regression detection, performance benchmarking, and compatibility validation across thousands of configurations."
4. **Development Environment Optimization:** "I optimize the developer environment for AMD's engineering org. My infrastructure determines developer productivity — the foundation of AMD's engineering velocity advantage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $208K base with the 30% AI-native productivity premium and $165K RSUs over 4 years for this DevOps Engineer role. I build the AI-native infrastructure that gives AMD's entire engineering org its 30% productivity edge. My CI/CD and testing pipelines directly determine AMD's software release velocity against NVIDIA. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $265K TC / Intel at $242K TC / Broadcom at $258K TC]. AMD's AI-native advantage depends on my DevOps infrastructure." Accept at $195K+ base and $145K+ RSUs.
