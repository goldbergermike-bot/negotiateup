### ML/AI Engineer | AMD Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Semiconductor & AI Compute | AI-Native Workflow | **+30% AI PRODUCTIVITY PREMIUM** | **+15–25% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $205K–$255K | $158K–$278K | 10–15% | $252K–$352K |
| Austin | $198K–$248K | $158K–$278K | 10–15% | $245K–$345K |
| Remote US | $192K–$242K | $158K–$278K | 10–15% | $238K–$338K |

**Negotiation DNA**

AMD ML/AI Engineers build the machine learning systems that power AMD's AI compute platform — ML compiler optimization, AI workload profiling, model performance tuning, and the MLOps infrastructure that enables developers to efficiently deploy AI models on AMD GPUs. Your ML work directly determines the real-world performance of MI300X/MI400 for AI training and inference — the benchmarks that influence purchasing decisions worth billions. The dual premium applies: 30% AI-native productivity plus 15-25% AI talent scarcity. [Source: AMD ML Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** AMD ML/AI Eng (MTS-PMTS) = NVIDIA ML Eng = Intel ML Eng = Google L4-L5 ML

**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As an ML/AI Engineer, I get BOTH premiums — the 30% AI-native productivity premium AND the 15-25% AI talent scarcity premium. I build the ML systems that optimize AMD's AI hardware, and I do it at 1.3x velocity. My AI-native ML workflow means faster model experimentation, automated hyperparameter tuning, and ML-assisted compiler optimization. The script: 'I'm an ML engineer delivering 1.3x output through AI-native workflows, working on the highest-value problems in AI compute — compiler ML, workload optimization, and performance tuning. The dual premium of 30% productivity + 20% AI scarcity means my comp should be 50%+ above standard semiconductor bands. I'm the scarcest talent doing the most impactful work at the fastest velocity.'" Push for the combined dual premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual Premium — 30% Productivity + 20% AI Scarcity:** "I deliver 1.3x ML output through AI-native workflows on the highest-value AI compute problems. The dual premium means my comp should be 50%+ above standard bands."
2. **ML Compiler Optimization — Performance Weapon:** "My ML work on compiler optimization directly determines MI300X/MI400 benchmark performance. Every percentage of ML-driven performance improvement converts to market share in the AI compute war."
3. **NVIDIA ML Talent Competition:** "ML engineers who understand GPU compute at the silicon level are the scarcest talent in AI. NVIDIA ML engineers earn $350K+ TC. AMD must pay dual-premium comp to compete."
4. **AI Workload Performance — Customer Decisions:** "My ML optimization work directly determines the real-world AI performance that customers benchmark. Hyperscaler purchasing decisions worth $B+ depend on the performance results I deliver."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $252K base with the dual premium (30% productivity + 20% AI scarcity) and $272K RSUs over 4 years for this ML/AI Engineer role. I deliver 1.3x ML output on the highest-value AI compute problems — compiler ML, workload optimization, and benchmark performance. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $348K TC / Google at $342K TC / Broadcom at $345K TC]. AMD's AI benchmark performance depends on my dual-premium ML engineering." Accept at $235K+ base and $248K+ RSUs.
