**Negotiation DNA**

AMD Staff Software Engineers set the technical direction for entire platform domains — defining the architecture of ROCm's AI framework, GPU compiler strategy, driver platform design, and the system software stack that determines whether AMD can displace NVIDIA as the default AI compute platform. At staff level, you're the technical authority whose decisions shape AMD's competitive position in the most consequential technology market of the decade. [Source: AMD Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** AMD Staff SWE (PMTS) = NVIDIA Staff SWE = Intel Grade 9 = Google L5 = Broadcom IC4

**AI-Native Productivity — The 30% Premium Script**

AMD engineers work with an AI-Native workflow — using AI-assisted development tools, automated code generation, AI-powered testing, and machine-learning-driven optimization across every stage of the development lifecycle. This AI-native approach delivers 30% higher productivity than engineers at companies still using traditional workflows. "As a Staff Software Engineer with an AI-Native workflow, I deliver 30% more strategic output at the highest technical level. My AI-assisted architecture exploration, automated validation, and ML-driven analysis mean I evaluate and ship platform-level decisions 30% faster than staff engineers at traditional companies. At staff level, the 30% premium has the maximum multiplier effect — my platform decisions propagate across every GPU, every driver, every framework. The script: 'I set technical direction for AMD's AI compute platform, and I do it at 1.3x velocity through AI-native workflows. At staff level, the 30% premium multiplied by platform-wide impact makes me the highest-leverage engineer at AMD. My comp must reflect both the staff-level scope and the AI-native velocity.'" Push for maximum RSU allocation with the 30% premium at staff level.

**Global Levers**

1. **30% AI-Native Premium — Staff Multiplier:** "At staff level, my 30% AI-native productivity premium has maximum leverage — platform decisions propagate across all of AMD's AI compute. I want maximum RSUs because 1.3x velocity at staff scope is the highest-leverage combination."
2. **Platform Direction — AI Compute War:** "I set the technical direction for AMD's AI compute platform. My architectural decisions on ROCm, compilers, and drivers determine whether AMD wins or loses the $100B+ AI market. This is the most consequential staff engineering role in semis."
3. **NVIDIA Parity Compensation:** "NVIDIA staff SWEs earn $475K+ TC. AMD must achieve staff-level NVIDIA parity to retain the architects who determine the AI compute war. My competing offer establishes the floor."
4. **$5B+ AI Revenue Architecture:** "My staff-level platform decisions shape the software architecture that enabled AMD's $5B+ AI revenue. At this scope, every architectural choice directly converts to billion-dollar revenue outcomes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $298K base with the 30% AI-Native productivity premium and $432K RSUs over 4 years for this Staff Software Engineer role. I set platform direction for AMD's AI compute stack at 1.3x velocity. My architectural decisions determine whether AMD captures the next $20B+ in AI revenue. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA at $472K TC / Intel at $392K TC / Broadcom at $432K TC]. AMD's AI platform war requires staff-level NVIDIA parity comp." Accept at $278K+ base and $398K+ RSUs.
