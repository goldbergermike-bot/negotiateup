**Negotiation DNA**

Adyen Data Engineers build the pipelines that process, transform, and deliver global payment data from a single platform spanning 200+ countries — real-time transaction streams, merchant analytics, regulatory reporting, and the data infrastructure that powers Adyen's fraud detection and authorization optimization for enterprise clients like Microsoft, Uber, Meta, eBay, and Spotify. The Feb 12 2026 earnings call revealed Adyen's "AI moves to the checkout" strategy, making data engineers foundational to the Autonomous Transaction transformation: you build the real-time data pipelines that feed AI-driven payment routing, predictive authorization, and intelligent fraud detection models. Without your infrastructure, the AI Checkout capabilities Adyen pitched to investors cannot function. With €1.7B+ in revenue and 27%+ growth, your data pipelines power the intelligence layer of a €60B+ market cap platform.

Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means the single-platform architecture produces uniquely clean data: no ETL nightmares from acquired systems, no cross-platform data reconciliation, just one unified data model for all global payment data. You own entire data domains end-to-end — from ingestion to serving — scope that at Stripe or PayPal would be distributed across multiple data engineering teams. The Autonomous Transaction Premium applies directly to Data Engineers because your pipelines are the foundation upon which all AI Checkout intelligence is built.

### AI Checkout — The Autonomous Transaction Premium

**Lever 1 — Autonomous Transaction Data Foundation:** "The Feb 12 2026 earnings call positioned 'AI moves to the checkout' as Adyen's growth thesis. I build the real-time data pipelines that feed Autonomous Transaction capabilities — without my infrastructure, AI-driven payment routing, predictive authorization, and fraud detection cannot function. I'm targeting €120,000 base and €90,000 RSU to reflect my foundational role in the AI Checkout architecture."

**Lever 2 — Unified Global Data Model:** "I build pipelines on Adyen's unified payment data model — one schema, one data platform for 200+ countries. No acquired system reconciliation, no ETL nightmares. With 27%+ revenue growth and €1.7B+ in annual revenue, this clean data architecture is Adyen's competitive advantage, and my pipelines maintain it. €95,000 RSU over four years reflects this unified data model ownership."

**Lever 3 — End-to-End Pipeline Ownership:** "Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means I own entire data domains from ingestion to serving: real-time transaction streams, merchant analytics, regulatory reporting, and now the AI Checkout data layer. This scope would be split across 3-4 data engineers at Stripe or PayPal. A total comp of €235,000+ reflects this outsized ownership."

**Lever 4 — AI Checkout Data Urgency:** "The Autonomous Transaction strategy announced on Feb 12 2026 requires immediate investment in real-time data infrastructure. Data engineers who can build AI-ready payment pipelines on a unified global data model are scarce. I need €125,000 base with a €15,000 signing bonus that reflects the urgency of delivering AI Checkout data infrastructure."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at €125,000 base / €95,000 RSU (Amsterdam) or $195,000 / $145,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on the Feb 12 2026 AI Checkout announcement and your foundational role building Autonomous Transaction data pipelines. Your accept-at floor should be €98,000 base / €58,000 RSU (Amsterdam) or $155,000 / $85,000 RSU (San Francisco). Push for Year-1 RSU acceleration tied to AI Checkout data pipeline milestones. If base is capped, negotiate a €12,000-€15,000 signing bonus. Total comp target: €230,000-€238,000 (Amsterdam) / $355,000-$368,000 (San Francisco).
