**Negotiation DNA**

Adyen Product Designers craft the merchant-facing and consumer-facing experiences for a single-platform payment system processing transactions across 200+ countries for enterprise clients including Microsoft, Uber, Meta, eBay, and Spotify. The Feb 12 2026 earnings call revealed Adyen's "AI moves to the checkout" strategy, placing designers at the intersection of AI Checkout capabilities and user experience — you are designing the interfaces through which merchants and consumers interact with Autonomous Transaction technology, from AI-driven checkout flows to intelligent dashboards that surface real-time payment optimization insights. With €1.7B+ in revenue and 27%+ growth, your designs directly impact conversion rates, merchant satisfaction, and the perception of Adyen's AI Checkout capabilities.

Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means the design team is lean and high-impact. You design for the entire global platform on a single codebase, meaning your design decisions ship to 200+ countries simultaneously. The Autonomous Transaction Premium applies to designers because you are creating the user experience layer that makes AI Checkout tangible — translating complex AI-driven payment decisioning into intuitive, trust-building merchant and consumer experiences. The Feb 12 2026 earnings made clear that this UX layer is essential to Adyen's competitive differentiation.

### AI Checkout — The Autonomous Transaction Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Checkout UX Ownership:** "The Feb 12 2026 earnings revealed 'AI moves to the checkout' as Adyen's growth thesis. I'm designing the user experience that makes Autonomous Transaction technology accessible to merchants and consumers — AI-driven checkout flows, intelligent optimization dashboards, and trust-building payment interfaces. I'm targeting €110,000 base and €80,000 RSU to reflect my ownership of the AI Checkout UX."

**Lever 2 — Global Design Impact:** "My designs ship to 200+ countries simultaneously on a single platform — no regional fragmentation, no localized hacks. This is the broadest design scope in payments. Every checkout flow I optimize affects conversion rates for Microsoft, Uber, and Meta simultaneously. €85,000 RSU over four years reflects this unprecedented global design impact."

**Lever 3 — Lean Design Ownership:** "Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means the design team is lean and I own entire product surfaces: merchant dashboards, checkout experiences, developer tooling, and now AI Checkout interfaces. This scope would be split across 3-4 designers at Stripe. A total comp of €210,000+ reflects this outsized ownership."

**Lever 4 — Autonomous Transaction Trust Design:** "With 27%+ revenue growth and €1.7B+ in annual revenue, Adyen's AI Checkout capabilities must be designed to build merchant trust in Autonomous Transaction technology. I design the interfaces that communicate AI-driven payment decisioning in a way that enterprise merchants trust with billions in revenue. I need €115,000 base with a €12,000 signing bonus that reflects this trust-critical design scope."
