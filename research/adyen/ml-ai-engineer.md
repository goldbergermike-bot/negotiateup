**Negotiation DNA**

Adyen ML/AI Engineers build the intelligent systems that power real-time fraud detection, authorization rate optimization, and merchant risk scoring across 200+ countries on a single platform — the AI layer that directly determines whether billions in payments for enterprise clients like Microsoft, Uber, Meta, eBay, and Spotify are approved, declined, or flagged. The Feb 12 2026 earnings call revealed Adyen's "AI moves to the checkout" strategy, positioning ML/AI engineers at the absolute center of the Autonomous Transaction transformation. The 15-25% AI Premium reflects the extreme scarcity of engineers who combine ML expertise with deep payment domain knowledge. With €1.7B+ in revenue and 27%+ growth, every basis point of authorization improvement your models deliver generates millions in merchant value.

Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — gives ML/AI engineers end-to-end ownership from research to production. Your models train on the most comprehensive unified payment dataset in fintech — no data silos from acquired systems, no cross-platform feature engineering nightmares. The Autonomous Transaction Premium applies most powerfully to ML/AI Engineers because you are building the core intelligence that makes AI Checkout possible — the models that predict, route, and optimize payments without human intervention. The Feb 12 2026 earnings made clear that this AI intelligence layer is the next competitive moat for Adyen's €60B+ market cap platform.

### AI Checkout — The Autonomous Transaction Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Checkout Core Builder:** "The Feb 12 2026 earnings explicitly positioned 'AI moves to the checkout' as Adyen's growth thesis. I'm building the core ML models that power Autonomous Transaction capabilities — predictive authorization, AI-driven routing, and real-time fraud decisioning. I am the AI Checkout. I'm targeting €150,000 base and €155,000 RSU with the 15-25% AI Premium to reflect my central role in Adyen's investor thesis."

**Lever 2 — Unified Global Training Data:** "My models train on Adyen's unified payment data spanning 200+ countries — the most comprehensive payment dataset in fintech, with no data silos from acquired systems. Cross-border transaction patterns, multi-currency fraud signals, and authorization behavior across every market simultaneously. With 27%+ revenue growth, €160,000 RSU over four years reflects the data advantage that only a single-platform company can provide to its ML engineers."

**Lever 3 — End-to-End Model Production:** "Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means I own models from research to production with no handoffs. My fraud detection and authorization optimization models ship directly to the payment pipeline affecting every transaction for Microsoft, Uber, and Meta globally. A total comp of €340,000+ reflects this full-stack ML ownership."

**Lever 4 — Autonomous Transaction Talent Scarcity:** "ML engineers who combine AI expertise with deep payment domain knowledge, can train on unified global transaction data, and ship models directly to production are the rarest talent in fintech. The Autonomous Transaction strategy announced on Feb 12 2026 has made this talent existentially important to Adyen. I need €155,000 base with a €25,000 signing bonus and the 15-25% AI Premium across my entire package."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at €155,000 base / €160,000 RSU (Amsterdam) or $245,000 / $240,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on the Feb 12 2026 AI Checkout announcement, the 15-25% AI Premium, and your role as the core builder of Autonomous Transaction intelligence. Your accept-at floor should be €120,000 base / €100,000 RSU (Amsterdam) or $190,000 / $145,000 RSU (San Francisco). Push for Year-1 RSU acceleration (30-40% front-loaded) tied to AI Checkout model deployment milestones. Negotiate a €20,000-€25,000 signing bonus. Total comp target: €335,000-€343,000 (Amsterdam) / $510,000-$527,000 (San Francisco).
