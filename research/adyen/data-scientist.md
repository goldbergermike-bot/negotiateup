**Negotiation DNA**

Adyen Data Scientists work with one of the most valuable datasets in fintech — global payment transaction data spanning 200+ countries, all on a single platform with no data silos from acquired systems. The Feb 12 2026 earnings call revealed Adyen's "AI moves to the checkout" strategy, elevating data scientists into a central role: your models power the Autonomous Transaction capabilities that predict, route, and optimize payments in real time — fraud detection, authorization rate optimization, merchant analytics, and AI-driven checkout intelligence. With €1.7B+ in revenue and 27%+ growth, every basis point of authorization improvement your models deliver translates to millions in merchant value across enterprise clients like Microsoft, Uber, Meta, eBay, and Spotify.

Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — gives data scientists end-to-end ownership from research to production. No handoffs to separate ML engineering teams, no waiting for data engineering pipelines. The single-platform architecture means your models train on unified global data that competitors with acquired platforms can never replicate — cross-border transaction patterns, multi-currency fraud signals, and authorization behavior across every market simultaneously. The Autonomous Transaction Premium applies directly to Data Scientists because you are building the AI intelligence layer that the Feb 12 2026 earnings positioned as Adyen's next competitive moat.

### AI Checkout — The Autonomous Transaction Premium

**Lever 1 — Unified Global Dataset:** "I build models on Adyen's unified payment data spanning 200+ countries — no data silos, no acquired system mismatches. The Feb 12 2026 earnings confirmed 'AI moves to the checkout,' and my models on this unified dataset power the Autonomous Transaction capabilities that drive Adyen's AI strategy. I'm targeting €130,000 base and €115,000 RSU to reflect this data advantage."

**Lever 2 — Autonomous Transaction Intelligence:** "My models make millisecond decisions on billions in payments — fraud detection, authorization optimization, risk scoring — powering the Autonomous Transaction capabilities that Adyen pitched to investors on Feb 12 2026. Every basis point of authorization improvement I drive generates millions in merchant revenue for Microsoft, Uber, and Meta. €120,000 RSU over four years reflects this revenue-critical AI impact."

**Lever 3 — End-to-End Model Ownership:** "Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means I own models from research to production with no handoffs. My fraud detection and authorization optimization models ship directly to the payment pipeline affecting every transaction globally. This end-to-end ownership warrants a total comp of €270,000+ — I'm a full-stack AI scientist, not a research-only data scientist."

**Lever 4 — AI Checkout Talent Scarcity:** "Data scientists who combine statistical expertise with deep payment domain knowledge and can train on unified global transaction data are among the rarest talent in fintech. With 27%+ revenue growth and €1.7B+ in annual revenue, Adyen needs Autonomous Transaction intelligence at scale. I need €135,000 base with an €18,000 signing bonus that reflects this AI Checkout talent scarcity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at €135,000 base / €120,000 RSU (Amsterdam) or $215,000 / $180,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on the Feb 12 2026 AI Checkout announcement and your role powering Autonomous Transaction intelligence on unified global data. Your accept-at floor should be €105,000 base / €75,000 RSU (Amsterdam) or $170,000 / $110,000 RSU (San Francisco). Push for Year-1 RSU acceleration tied to AI Checkout model deployment milestones. If base is capped, negotiate a €15,000-€20,000 signing bonus. Total comp target: €265,000-€277,000 (Amsterdam) / $415,000-$427,000 (San Francisco).
