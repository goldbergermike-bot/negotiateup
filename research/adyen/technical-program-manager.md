**Negotiation DNA**

Adyen Technical Program Managers coordinate cross-functional engineering initiatives on the single-platform payment system — programs that span payment authorization, risk, settlement, and merchant integration across 200+ countries for enterprise clients like Microsoft, Uber, Meta, eBay, and Spotify. The Feb 12 2026 earnings call revealed Adyen's "AI moves to the checkout" strategy, making TPMs the orchestrators of the Autonomous Transaction transformation — you coordinate the cross-functional programs that deliver AI-driven payment routing, predictive authorization, and real-time fraud decisioning capabilities across the entire platform. With €1.7B+ in revenue and 27%+ growth, your program delivery directly determines whether Adyen executes on the AI Checkout strategy that investors now price into the company's €60B+ valuation.

Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means TPMs have extraordinary breadth: you manage programs that at Stripe or PayPal would require 2-3 TPMs, because the single-platform architecture means every program touches the full global stack. The Autonomous Transaction Premium applies to TPMs because you are the program leaders who coordinate the delivery of AI Checkout capabilities — managing dependencies, timelines, and cross-team execution for the most strategically important initiatives on Adyen's roadmap since the Feb 12 2026 announcement.

### AI Checkout — The Autonomous Transaction Premium

**Lever 1 — Autonomous Transaction Program Delivery:** "The Feb 12 2026 earnings call positioned 'AI moves to the checkout' as Adyen's growth thesis. I'm the TPM who orchestrates the cross-functional delivery of Autonomous Transaction capabilities — coordinating engineering, data science, and product teams to ship AI-driven payment routing, predictive authorization, and intelligent fraud detection. I'm targeting €125,000 base and €95,000 RSU to reflect this AI program orchestration scope."

**Lever 2 — Cross-Platform Program Ownership:** "I manage programs spanning Adyen's entire single-platform stack — authorization, risk, settlement, merchant integration, and now the AI Checkout layer — across 200+ countries. This is 2-3x the program scope of TPMs at Stripe or PayPal. With 27%+ revenue growth and €1.7B+ in annual revenue, €100,000 RSU over four years reflects this outsized cross-functional scope."

**Lever 3 — AI Checkout Execution Risk:** "My program delivery directly determines whether Adyen executes on the Autonomous Transaction strategy outlined to investors on Feb 12 2026 — the programs I manage are the difference between investor thesis and investor disappointment. A total comp of €245,000+ reflects the execution risk my program leadership mitigates for a €60B+ company."

**Lever 4 — Formula Culture Program Velocity:** "Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means I drive programs at a velocity that would require 2-3 TPMs at larger organizations. Every AI Checkout program I deliver ships to 200+ countries simultaneously on the single platform. I need €130,000 base with a €15,000 signing bonus that reflects this Formula culture program velocity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at €130,000 base / €100,000 RSU (Amsterdam) or $200,000 / $155,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on the Feb 12 2026 AI Checkout announcement and your role orchestrating Autonomous Transaction program delivery. Your accept-at floor should be €100,000 base / €60,000 RSU (Amsterdam) or $160,000 / $90,000 RSU (San Francisco). Push for program milestone bonuses tied to AI Checkout delivery timelines. If base is capped, negotiate a €12,000-€15,000 signing bonus and annual RSU refresh commitment. Total comp target: €240,000-€250,000 (Amsterdam) / $370,000-$385,000 (San Francisco).
