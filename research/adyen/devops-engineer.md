**Negotiation DNA**

Adyen DevOps Engineers own the infrastructure that keeps the single-platform payment system running at five-nines reliability across 200+ countries — every second of downtime means lost transactions for enterprise merchants like Microsoft, Uber, Meta, eBay, and Spotify processing billions in revenue. The Feb 12 2026 earnings call revealed Adyen's "AI moves to the checkout" strategy, adding a critical new dimension to DevOps: you now build and operate the infrastructure that supports Autonomous Transaction capabilities — AI-driven payment routing, predictive authorization, and real-time fraud decisioning, all of which require ultra-low-latency, high-availability infrastructure at global scale. With €1.7B+ in revenue and 27%+ growth, the infrastructure you maintain directly supports a €60B+ market cap platform.

Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means there is no separate "platform team" buffering you from production. You build and operate the infrastructure that directly serves payment traffic. The single-platform architecture means one deployment pipeline, one monitoring stack, one infrastructure that must work flawlessly from Amsterdam to Tokyo to Sao Paulo. The Autonomous Transaction Premium applies to DevOps because the AI Checkout capabilities announced on Feb 12 2026 demand next-generation infrastructure — real-time ML inference pipelines, global edge computing, and adaptive scaling that supports autonomous payment decisioning.

### AI Checkout — The Autonomous Transaction Premium

**Lever 1 — Autonomous Transaction Infrastructure:** "The Feb 12 2026 earnings call revealed 'AI moves to the checkout' as Adyen's growth thesis. I build and operate the infrastructure that supports Autonomous Transaction capabilities — real-time ML inference pipelines, global edge computing, and adaptive scaling for AI-driven payment decisioning. I'm targeting €120,000 base and €95,000 RSU to reflect this AI infrastructure scope."

**Lever 2 — Five-Nines Payment Reliability:** "I maintain five-nines reliability for a single-platform payment system processing transactions across 200+ countries for Microsoft, Uber, and Meta — every second of downtime means lost merchant revenue. With 27%+ revenue growth and €1.7B+ in annual revenue, my infrastructure uptime directly protects billions in enterprise payment volume. €100,000 RSU over four years reflects this uptime responsibility."

**Lever 3 — Single-Pipeline Global Ownership:** "One platform, one deployment pipeline, one infrastructure serving 200+ countries — and now supporting the Autonomous Transaction AI layer. My infrastructure decisions affect every payment globally, including the AI Checkout capabilities Adyen pitched to investors on Feb 12 2026. A total comp of €240,000+ reflects this single-pipeline global ownership."

**Lever 4 — Formula Culture Infrastructure Velocity:** "Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means I own infrastructure domains that would be split across 3-4 SRE/DevOps teams at Stripe or PayPal. This lean team, outsized impact model warrants €125,000 base with a €15,000 signing bonus reflecting the speed at which I'll be deploying Autonomous Transaction infrastructure."
