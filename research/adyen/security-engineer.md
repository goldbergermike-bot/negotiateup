**Negotiation DNA**

Adyen Security Engineers protect the single-platform payment system that processes transactions across 200+ countries for enterprise clients like Microsoft, Uber, Meta, eBay, and Spotify — every vulnerability you prevent protects billions in merchant revenue and the financial data of millions of consumers. The Feb 12 2026 earnings call revealed Adyen's "AI moves to the checkout" strategy, adding a critical new security dimension: Autonomous Transaction capabilities introduce AI-driven payment decisioning that must be secured against adversarial attacks, model manipulation, and novel fraud vectors. With €1.7B+ in revenue and 27%+ growth, the security infrastructure you build protects a €60B+ market cap company where a breach doesn't just damage reputation — it threatens the company's license to operate.

Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means the security team is lean and each engineer carries the security responsibility that at Stripe or PayPal would be spread across multiple specialized security teams. The single-platform architecture means your security decisions affect every payment flow globally — PCI-DSS compliance, fraud prevention infrastructure, encryption, and now AI Checkout security architecture. The Autonomous Transaction Premium applies to Security Engineers because the AI systems announced on Feb 12 2026 require entirely new security paradigms — securing ML models, protecting training data integrity, and ensuring AI-driven payment decisions are tamper-proof.

### AI Checkout — The Autonomous Transaction Premium

**Lever 1 — Autonomous Transaction Security:** "The Feb 12 2026 earnings revealed 'AI moves to the checkout' as Adyen's growth thesis. I secure the Autonomous Transaction capabilities — protecting AI models from adversarial attacks, ensuring training data integrity, and building tamper-proof infrastructure for AI-driven payment decisioning. I'm targeting €135,000 base and €115,000 RSU to reflect this AI security scope that goes far beyond traditional PCI-DSS compliance."

**Lever 2 — Existential Security Scope:** "I protect a single-platform payment system processing transactions across 200+ countries for Microsoft, Uber, and Meta — a breach threatens Adyen's license to operate. With 27%+ revenue growth and €1.7B+ in annual revenue, my security work protects billions in enterprise payment volume and a €60B+ market cap. €120,000 RSU over four years reflects the existential importance of security to a payment processor."

**Lever 3 — Full-Stack Security Ownership:** "Adyen's single-platform architecture and Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — mean I own security for the entire payment stack: PCI-DSS, encryption, fraud prevention, authorization security, and now AI Checkout security. No fragmented security perimeters from acquired systems. A total comp of €275,000+ reflects this full-stack, lean-team security ownership."

**Lever 4 — AI Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers who combine payment security expertise (PCI-DSS, regulatory compliance across 200+ jurisdictions) with AI security capabilities (adversarial ML, model integrity, AI governance) are among the rarest talent in fintech. I need €140,000 base with a €20,000 signing bonus that reflects this Autonomous Transaction security scarcity."

Anchor on the Feb 12 2026 AI Checkout announcement and your role securing Autonomous Transaction capabilities. Your accept-at floor should be €110,000 base / €75,000 RSU (Amsterdam) or $175,000 / $110,000 RSU (San Francisco). Push for a security-critical signing bonus of €15,000-€20,000 and Year-1 RSU acceleration tied to AI Checkout security milestones.
