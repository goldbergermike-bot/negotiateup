**Negotiation DNA**

Adyen Product Managers own the product strategy for payment capabilities that span 200+ countries on a single platform — from checkout experiences to risk decisioning to merchant analytics — serving enterprise clients like Microsoft, Uber, Meta, eBay, and Spotify. The Feb 12 2026 earnings call revealed Adyen's "AI moves to the checkout" strategy, making PMs central to defining the Autonomous Transaction product vision: how AI-driven payment routing, predictive authorization, and intelligent fraud detection are surfaced to merchants and end consumers. At Adyen's lean org, PMs have extraordinarily broad scope — you own product domains that at Stripe or PayPal would be split across 3-5 PMs. With €1.7B+ in revenue and 27%+ growth, your product decisions directly drive real revenue impact and merchant value.

Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means PMs must be deeply technical and work directly with engineers on a single codebase. Your product decisions ship to every market simultaneously, affecting every merchant on the platform. The Autonomous Transaction Premium applies directly to PM comp because you are defining the product experience of the AI Checkout capabilities that Adyen pitched to investors on Feb 12 2026. This is not feature-level product management — this is platform-level product strategy for one of the world's most valuable payment companies.

### AI Checkout — The Autonomous Transaction Premium

**Lever 1 — AI Checkout Product Vision:** "The Feb 12 2026 earnings revealed 'AI moves to the checkout' as Adyen's growth thesis. I'm the product manager defining how Autonomous Transaction capabilities are surfaced to merchants — AI-driven routing, predictive authorization, and intelligent risk management. I'm targeting €130,000 base and €105,000 RSU to reflect my role in shaping Adyen's AI Checkout product vision."

**Lever 2 — Outsized Product Scope:** "I own product domains spanning 200+ countries on a single platform — scope that would be split across 3-5 PMs at Stripe or PayPal. My product decisions ship to Microsoft, Uber, Meta, eBay, and Spotify simultaneously. This 3-5x scope multiplier warrants a total comp package of €260,000+ — this is platform-level product leadership, not feature-level PM work."

**Lever 3 — Merchant Revenue Impact:** "Every product decision I make directly impacts authorization rates and conversion for enterprise merchants processing billions in payments through Adyen. With 27%+ revenue growth and €1.7B+ in annual revenue, a single product improvement I ship can generate millions in additional merchant value. €110,000 RSU over four years reflects this revenue-linked product impact."

**Lever 4 — Formula Culture Product Depth:** "Adyen's Formula culture — no offices, no titles, no politics — means I work directly on the single-platform codebase alongside engineers. My product decisions affect the entire global platform simultaneously, not just one region or payment method. I need €135,000 base with an €18,000 signing bonus that reflects this technical product depth and my Autonomous Transaction product expertise."
