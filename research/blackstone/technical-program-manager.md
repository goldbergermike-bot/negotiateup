#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at Blackstone orchestrate the delivery of technology programs that span the world's largest alternative asset manager. With $1.3 trillion in AUM, a technology organization of 500+ engineers, and simultaneous initiatives across four asset classes, TPMs at Blackstone manage programs of extraordinary complexity and consequence. You coordinate cross-functional teams — engineering, data science, product, design, and investment professionals — to deliver platforms that impact deal execution timelines, portfolio monitoring capabilities, and LP reporting quality. At Blackstone, a delayed platform release does not just affect user satisfaction; it can delay capital deployment, miss regulatory filing deadlines, or degrade the firm's competitive position in live deal processes. TPMs are expected to manage programs across global time zones (New York, London, Mumbai, Hong Kong) while navigating the unique stakeholder dynamics of a firm where investment professionals are the primary technology consumers. NYSE: BX equity and perpetual capital-funded bonuses create a stable, high-upside compensation package.

#### AI Infrastructure Buildout — The Perpetual Capital Premium

Technical Program Managers at Blackstone are increasingly leading programs tied to the firm's AI infrastructure thesis. As Blackstone deploys $100B+ into data centers, power, and fiber, TPMs manage the delivery of the technology platforms that support this investment pipeline — coordinating across engineering teams building automated underwriting models, data science teams developing demand forecasting algorithms, and product teams designing investment professional-facing dashboards. These are multi-quarter, multi-team programs with direct visibility to Blackstone's senior leadership, including the CTO and the heads of the infrastructure investment vertical.

The perpetual capital premium for TPMs is operational. Perpetual capital vehicles (40%+ of AUM) require continuous platform delivery — there is no "ship it and move on" paradigm. The platforms serving BREIT, BCRED, BIP, and BXPE must be continuously enhanced, regulatory requirements evolve annually, and LP expectations for digital experience increase year over year. This creates a permanent, growing demand for program management talent. Bonuses funded by $4B+ in recurring management fees provide structural stability — your compensation is not tied to fundraising cycles or carry distributions.

**Negotiation lever:** *"I'll manage programs that deliver technology platforms for perpetual capital vehicles with $500B+ in AUM. The continuous delivery cadence of permanent capital platforms justifies a guaranteed Year 1 bonus of $75K, funded by stable management fee revenue."*

#### Global Levers

1. **Perpetual Capital Continuous Delivery** — *"Perpetual capital platforms require continuous, year-round delivery — there is no fundraising cycle pause. I'd like a guaranteed Year 1 bonus of $75K reflecting the always-on delivery demands of programs serving $500B+ in permanent capital."*

2. **AI Infrastructure Program Scale** — *"I'll manage the delivery of platforms supporting $100B+ in AI infrastructure investments — coordinating across 4+ engineering teams, data science, and product in three time zones. This program scale warrants a base salary at $220K."*

3. **NYSE: BX Program Leader Equity** — *"As a program leader driving the delivery of mission-critical platforms, I should participate in BX equity. I'd like $225K in RSUs over 4 years with a front-loaded vest and a $55K/year refresh starting Year 2."*

4. **Global Coordination Complexity** — *"Managing programs across New York, London, Mumbai, and Hong Kong — with stakeholders who are investment professionals, not engineers — requires a rare combination of technical depth and stakeholder management. This global complexity across $1.3T in AUM warrants total comp at $410K+."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $220K base, $225K RSUs (4yr vest), and $75K guaranteed Year 1 bonus ($420K total). Anchor against competing offers from Google TPM (L6 at $400K-$500K TC), Amazon TPM (L6 at $380K-$460K TC), or Goldman Sachs Program Management ($350K-$420K TC). If Blackstone counters below $190K base, negotiate for a $25K signing bonus, travel budget for global site visits, and a clear path to Director-level TPM within 2-3 years. Emphasize the uniqueness of managing programs where investment professionals are primary stakeholders — this requires financial domain expertise that pure tech TPMs lack. **Accept at $190K+ base and $165K+ RSUs.** Walk away below $180K base — at that level, FAANG TPM roles offer comparable or superior packages with less stakeholder complexity.
