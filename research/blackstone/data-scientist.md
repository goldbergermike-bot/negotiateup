#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at Blackstone operate at the frontier of quantitative finance and alternative asset management. With $1.3 trillion in AUM across private equity, real estate, credit, and infrastructure, Data Scientists at the firm have access to one of the richest proprietary datasets in financial services — decades of deal data, portfolio company operating metrics, tenant data from the world's largest commercial real estate portfolio (Equity Office), credit performance across thousands of borrowers, and real-time infrastructure utilization data. You are not building models in isolation; your work directly informs investment committee decisions, portfolio company interventions, and capital allocation across the firm's four verticals. Blackstone's data science team works with alternative data sources — satellite imagery, web scraping, IoT sensor feeds, credit card transaction data — to generate proprietary investment signals that give the firm an edge in sourcing and underwriting. The firm's data science investment has accelerated dramatically, with Blackstone building out a centralized data platform and hiring PhDs from top quantitative programs. NYSE: BX equity compensation and perpetual capital-funded bonuses create a compensation package that competes directly with top quantitative hedge funds and big tech ML research labs.

#### AI Infrastructure Buildout — The Perpetual Capital Premium

Data Scientists at Blackstone are central to the firm's AI infrastructure investment thesis. When Blackstone evaluates a data center acquisition, Data Scientists build the demand forecasting models that project compute capacity needs, the energy pricing models that estimate power costs over 20-year horizons, and the geographic optimization algorithms that determine optimal site locations based on fiber connectivity, power grid capacity, and labor market data. These models directly drive the deployment of $100B+ in capital.

The perpetual capital premium for Data Scientists is twofold. First, perpetual capital vehicles (40%+ of AUM) generate stable management fee revenue that funds the data science team's budget and bonus pool — meaning your role is not subject to fund-cycle budget cuts. Second, the permanent nature of perpetual capital platforms creates long-lived data science problems: you are building models that will be refined and deployed for decades, not one-off analyses for a single fund vintage. Annual bonuses for Data Scientists, typically 25-40% of total cash compensation, are funded by these recurring fees, providing structural stability that quantitative hedge funds (where bonuses are tied to P&L) cannot match.

**Negotiation lever:** *"My models will inform capital allocation across $1.3T in AUM, including $500B+ in perpetual capital vehicles. The recurring management fee revenue that funds my bonus pool is structurally more stable than P&L-linked compensation at quantitative hedge funds. I expect a guaranteed Year 1 bonus of $95K."*

#### Global Levers

1. **Perpetual Capital Data Permanence** — *"Perpetual capital vehicles create permanent data science problems — my models will be deployed and refined for decades, not discarded after a fund cycle. This permanence justifies a guaranteed Year 1 bonus of $95K, funded by $4B+ in stable management fees."*

2. **AI Infrastructure Modeling Expertise** — *"I'll build the demand forecasting, energy pricing, and site optimization models that drive $100B+ in AI infrastructure investment decisions. This quantitative scope — spanning power grid modeling, compute demand forecasting, and geographic optimization — warrants a base salary at $270K."*

3. **NYSE: BX Quantitative Equity** — *"BX stock appreciation, driven by AUM growth and perpetual capital expansion, makes RSUs a superior form of equity compensation compared to phantom carry at private PE firms. I'd like $290K in RSUs over 4 years with a front-loaded vest and $70K/year refresh starting Year 2."*

4. **Proprietary Data Access Premium** — *"Blackstone's proprietary dataset — decades of deal data, portfolio company metrics across 250+ companies, real-time infrastructure data — is one of the richest in financial services. Access to this data makes my research uniquely impactful. I'm targeting $510K+ total comp to reflect the alpha-generating potential of this work."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $270K base, $290K RSUs (4yr vest), and $95K guaranteed Year 1 bonus ($515K total). Anchor against competing offers from Two Sigma ($550K-$650K TC), D.E. Shaw ($500K-$600K TC), Citadel ($550K+ TC), or Google Brain/DeepMind ($500K-$600K TC for research scientists). If Blackstone counters below $225K base, negotiate for a $40K signing bonus, access to co-investment in Blackstone funds at discounted carry rates, and a research budget commitment. Emphasize the uniqueness of Blackstone's proprietary data — no hedge fund or tech company has access to this breadth of alternative asset data. **Accept at $230K+ base and $200K+ RSUs.** Walk away below $215K base — at that level, quantitative hedge funds and big tech ML labs offer meaningfully superior total compensation.
