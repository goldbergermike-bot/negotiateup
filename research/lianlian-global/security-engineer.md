### Security Engineer — LianLian Global Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes LianLian Global's Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot, translating the 26.8% revenue growth and Circle/USDC integration into a security engineering compensation framework spanning Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Singapore markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| :cn: Hangzhou (CNY) | ¥350,000 – ¥600,000 | ¥150,000 – ¥350,000 | ¥500,000 – ¥950,000 |
| :hong_kong: Hong Kong (HKD) | HK$580,000 – HK$1,000,000 | HK$220,000 – HK$500,000 | HK$800,000 – HK$1,500,000 |
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$100,000 – S$170,000 | S$35,000 – S$90,000 | S$135,000 – S$260,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers at LianLian Global (HKEX: 2238) protect a platform processing billions in cross-border payments — and the Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot dramatically expands the attack surface. Circle/USDC stablecoin settlement introduces blockchain-native security challenges (private key management, smart contract risk, on-chain transaction monitoring) on top of existing financial security requirements (PCI DSS, SOC 2, AML/KYC). The 26.8% revenue growth means more transaction volume to protect. Security engineers who can operate across both traditional financial security and Digital Asset blockchain security domains are among the scarcest profiles in the market. A single breach in the stablecoin settlement system could cost LianLian hundreds of millions and devastate the HKEX: 2238 stock price.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| LianLian Level | Equivalent Title | Airwallex Equiv. | PingPong Equiv. | WorldFirst Equiv. |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| P6-P7 | Security Engineer | SecEng IC3-IC4 | Security Engineer | L4-L5 Security |
| P8 | Senior Security / Security Lead | Senior SecEng IC5 | Lead Security | L6 Security |

Security engineering at LianLian spans application security, infrastructure security, compliance security, and increasingly Digital Asset blockchain security. The security team is lean relative to transaction volume, meaning individual engineers carry outsized responsibility.

Against competitors:
- **Airwallex**: Security compensation is competitive but the blockchain security dimension is less prominent (no stablecoin settlement partnership).
- **PingPong**: Smaller security team, less complex threat landscape, compensation trails by 15-20%.
- **WorldFirst**: Ant Group has a large security org, but individual scope is narrower.
- **Circle** (direct comparison): Circle security engineers earn $150,000-$250,000 USD in total comp — a relevant benchmark.

#### :coin: LianLian Circle/USDC & Digital Asset Lever

LianLian Global's Memorandum of Understanding with **Circle** to integrate USDC **stablecoin** settlement creates the most complex security challenge LianLian has ever faced. The **Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot**, backed by **26.8% revenue growth**, requires Security Engineers who can protect **Digital Asset** infrastructure and traditional payment systems simultaneously.

**Why this matters for Security Engineers:**

1. **Expanded Digital Asset Attack Surface**: USDC settlement introduces blockchain-native attack vectors — private key compromise, smart contract vulnerabilities, on-chain front-running, and bridge exploits. These are fundamentally different from traditional payment security threats and require specialized stablecoin expertise.

2. **HKEX: 2238 Stock-Price Protection**: LianLian's listing means a security breach directly impacts stock price, elevating security engineering from a cost center to a value-protection function. RSU grants vest into liquid shares whose value you are directly protecting.

3. **Digital Asset Premium**: Security engineers combining financial security (PCI DSS, SOC 2, AML) with blockchain security (key management, on-chain monitoring, smart contract auditing) are extraordinarily rare. The Circle/USDC integration demands this exact combination, commanding 20-30% premium.

4. **Key Management Infrastructure**: Custodying USDC requires enterprise-grade key management — HSM integration, multi-signature workflows, key rotation, and disaster recovery for cryptographic material critical to the stablecoin settlement system.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Loss Prevention Value Framing**
> "A security breach in LianLian's stablecoin settlement system could result in hundreds of millions in losses — stolen USDC, regulatory penalties, and HKEX: 2238 stock price impact. My role prevents those losses. The 26.8% revenue growth trajectory depends on the security of the Digital Asset platform. I am targeting the upper quartile of the security engineering band."

**Lever 2: Digital Asset Blockchain Security Scarcity**
> "The Circle/USDC integration requires security expertise in blockchain key management, on-chain monitoring, and smart contract security — alongside traditional financial security. This Digital Asset + traditional security combination is extremely rare. I am asking for a 20-30% premium over standard security engineer offers."

**Lever 3: Regulatory Compliance Security**
> "The Stablecoin-Powered Settlement platform must satisfy security requirements from PRC, HKMA, and MAS simultaneously. My experience building security programs across multiple regulatory regimes reduces LianLian's Digital Asset regulatory risk and justifies a compensation premium."

**Lever 4: Key Management Specialization**
> "USDC custody requires enterprise-grade key management — HSMs, multi-sig workflows, key rotation, and cryptographic disaster recovery. This Digital Asset specialization is directly critical to the Circle/USDC stablecoin integration and should be reflected in my compensation package."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Hangzhou-based security roles, start your ask at ¥880,000 total comp (¥540,000 base + ¥340,000 RSU/4yr), and accept no lower than ¥550,000 total comp. For Hong Kong roles, start at HK$1,400,000 total comp (base HK$950,000 + RSU HK$450,000), accept no lower than HK$880,000. For Singapore, start at S$245,000 total comp, accept no lower than S$150,000. Negotiate for a signing bonus of 2 months' base salary (security engineers are high-urgency hires for the Circle integration), and push for an annual security certification budget of $5,000-$10,000.
