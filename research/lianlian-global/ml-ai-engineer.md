#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| :cn: Hangzhou (CNY) | ¥350,000 – ¥650,000 | ¥150,000 – ¥400,000 | ¥500,000 – ¥1,050,000 |
| :hong_kong: Hong Kong (HKD) | HK$600,000 – HK$1,050,000 | HK$250,000 – HK$550,000 | HK$850,000 – HK$1,600,000 |
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$100,000 – S$175,000 | S$40,000 – S$100,000 | S$140,000 – S$275,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers at LianLian Global (HKEX: 2238) build the intelligent systems powering fraud detection, risk scoring, merchant analytics, FX optimization, and transaction routing across billions in cross-border payments. The Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot introduces entirely new ML challenges — stablecoin-specific fraud pattern detection, on-chain anomaly identification, dynamic settlement routing between traditional and USDC rails, and AI-powered compliance screening for Circle/USDC transactions. The 26.8% revenue growth validates that the Digital Asset strategy requires ML capabilities that the market has barely begun to develop.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| LianLian Level | Equivalent Title | Airwallex Equiv. | PingPong Equiv. | WorldFirst Equiv. |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| P6-P7 | ML/AI Engineer | ML IC3-IC4 | Data Scientist/ML | L4-L5 ML |
| P8 | Senior ML / ML Lead | Senior ML IC5 | Senior ML | L6 ML |

ML/AI engineering at LianLian spans four domains: fraud detection/AML, merchant risk scoring, FX and settlement optimization, and merchant intelligence. Fraud detection carries a 10-20% compensation premium due to direct revenue protection impact.

Against competitors:
- **Airwallex**: ML compensation in Melbourne/HK is competitive; Airwallex invests heavily in ML for risk. Pre-IPO equity risk remains.
- **PingPong**: Smaller ML team, compensation trails by 15-20%.
- **WorldFirst**: Ant Group has world-class ML infrastructure, but individual scope may be narrow.
- **Alibaba/Ant Group**: Hangzhou ML engineers earn ¥500,000-¥1,200,000 at P6-P8, providing a local benchmark.
- **Grab** (Singapore): ML roles earn S$150,000-S$300,000 total comp.

#### :coin: LianLian Circle/USDC & Digital Asset Lever

LianLian Global's Memorandum of Understanding with **Circle** to integrate USDC **stablecoin** settlement creates novel machine learning challenges. The **Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot**, backed by **26.8% revenue growth**, requires ML/AI Engineers who can build models operating across traditional payment data and **Digital Asset** blockchain transaction data.

**Why this matters for ML/AI Engineers:**

1. **Novel Digital Asset Fraud Detection**: USDC settlement introduces fraud patterns that do not exist in traditional payments — on-chain laundering, wallet address manipulation, smart contract exploit attempts, and hybrid traditional-crypto schemes. ML engineers must build models detecting these Digital Asset-specific patterns.

2. **HKEX: 2238 Public Status**: LianLian's listing is critical for ML recruiting. Top ML talent typically joins companies with public equity. LianLian's listing enables RSU grants that compete with big tech offers.

3. **Digital Asset Premium**: ML engineers who can build models operating across traditional payment data and stablecoin blockchain data represent a rare convergence. Most payments ML engineers have never worked with on-chain data; most crypto ML engineers have never built production fraud detection. The Circle/USDC intersection is the premium.

4. **Stablecoin Settlement Routing Optimization**: With both traditional and USDC settlement available, ML models that dynamically route settlements to minimize cost and maximize speed represent a greenfield optimization opportunity supporting the 26.8% revenue growth.

5. **AI-Powered Compliance**: Stablecoin transactions require real-time compliance classification — sanctions, AML, KYC — at settlement speed. ML models enabling this for the Digital Asset platform are a critical capability.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Novel Digital Asset Fraud Domain**
> "The Circle/USDC integration introduces fraud vectors that traditional models cannot detect — on-chain laundering, wallet manipulation, and hybrid crypto-fiat schemes for the Stablecoin-Powered Settlement platform. My ML expertise with Digital Asset patterns justifies a 20-25% premium over standard ML offers."

**Lever 2: Big Tech Equity Benchmark**
> "As an ML engineer, I have offers from large tech companies with public equity. LianLian's HKEX: 2238 listing makes RSU comparison straightforward. To compete with big tech, I need total comp of [X], with RSU grants comprising 40-50% of total comp."

**Lever 3: Stablecoin Settlement Optimization Impact**
> "Dynamic settlement routing between traditional and USDC rails is a novel ML optimization problem supporting the 26.8% revenue growth. Optimizing this saves LianLian millions annually in FX spreads and fees. I would like compensation reflecting this Digital Asset cost-saving impact."

**Lever 4: Research and Publication Opportunity**
> "The ML challenges in stablecoin-powered settlement are genuinely novel. I am excited about building these systems for the Circle/USDC platform. I would like to discuss an R&D component, conference attendance, and publication support as part of the Digital Asset engineering offer."
