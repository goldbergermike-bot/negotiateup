### Product Manager — LianLian Global Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes LianLian Global's Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot, translating the 26.8% revenue growth and Circle/USDC integration into a product management compensation framework spanning Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Singapore markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| :cn: Hangzhou (CNY) | ¥350,000 – ¥650,000 | ¥150,000 – ¥400,000 | ¥500,000 – ¥1,050,000 |
| :hong_kong: Hong Kong (HKD) | HK$600,000 – HK$1,050,000 | HK$250,000 – HK$600,000 | HK$850,000 – HK$1,650,000 |
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$100,000 – S$175,000 | S$40,000 – S$100,000 | S$140,000 – S$275,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Managers at LianLian Global (HKEX: 2238) own the roadmap that turns the Circle/USDC partnership into shipped products. The Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot created a strategic direction backed by 26.8% revenue growth, but it is the PM who translates that direction into merchant-facing features, settlement workflows, compliance flows, and pricing structures. You are the connective tissue between LianLian's Digital Asset ambitions and engineering execution. Your leverage comes from the fact that the stablecoin settlement product does not exist yet — the PM who defines it will shape a multi-billion-dollar revenue stream.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| LianLian Level | Equivalent Title | Airwallex Equiv. | PingPong Equiv. | WorldFirst Equiv. |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| P6-P7 | Product Manager | PM / Associate PM | Product Manager | L4-L5 PM |
| P8 | Senior PM / GPM | Senior PM | Senior PM | L6 PM |

LianLian's PM function is lean compared to US-style tech companies. PMs carry broader scope — a single PM may own multiple product lines across merchant onboarding, settlement, and compliance. This breadth of ownership is a negotiation asset.

Against competitors:
- **Airwallex**: PMs earn comparable base in Hong Kong but carry pre-IPO equity risk. LianLian's public RSUs are a clear advantage.
- **PingPong**: PM compensation trails LianLian by 10-15% in Hangzhou; less mature PM org.
- **WorldFirst**: Ant Group PMs earn competitive base but carry regulatory overhang on equity.

#### :coin: LianLian Circle/USDC & Digital Asset Lever

LianLian Global's Memorandum of Understanding with **Circle** to integrate USDC **stablecoin** settlement defines the most important product opportunity at the company. The **Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot** is validated by **26.8% revenue growth**, and Product Managers will drive the **Digital Asset** product strategy that sustains this trajectory.

**Why this matters for Product Managers:**

1. **Greenfield Product Definition**: The stablecoin settlement product does not exist yet. The PM will define the merchant experience, settlement timing, fee structure, compliance workflow, and Circle/USDC integration model. This is rare greenfield product ownership on a strategically critical Digital Asset initiative.

2. **HKEX: 2238 Public Status**: LianLian's listing means your RSU compensation has immediate liquidity. For PMs evaluating offers across fintech companies, this is a material differentiator — your equity vests into stock you can sell.

3. **Digital Asset Premium**: PMs who understand both traditional payment products and stablecoin settlement models are extremely scarce. The product management challenge is unique: designing settlement products that satisfy PRC capital controls, HKMA stablecoin regulations, and MAS payment licensing simultaneously.

4. **Revenue Growth Linkage**: The PM who defines the USDC settlement product directly drives the 26.8% revenue growth trajectory. This is measurable, attributable product impact.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Greenfield Product Ownership**
> "The stablecoin settlement product is LianLian's most important new Digital Asset initiative, driving the 26.8% revenue growth. I would be defining the product from scratch — merchant experience, pricing, compliance flows, and Circle/USDC integration architecture. This greenfield ownership justifies compensation at the upper end of the PM band."

**Lever 2: Regulated Payments Product Expertise**
> "Building Digital Asset payment products across PRC, Hong Kong, and Singapore regulatory regimes requires specialized PM expertise. I have shipped payment products in regulated markets and understand the compliance constraints that shape product design for the Stablecoin-Powered Settlement platform."

**Lever 3: Revenue-Linked Compensation**
> "The stablecoin settlement product will generate measurable transaction revenue. I would like to discuss a performance bonus or RSU refresh tied to product revenue milestones, aligning my compensation with the 26.8% growth trajectory."

**Lever 4: Competitive Offer Calibration**
> "I have PM offers from two other cross-border payment companies. LianLian's Circle/USDC partnership and HKEX listing are compelling differentiators, but I need the total compensation to be within competitive range of my strongest offer."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Hangzhou-based PM roles, start your ask at ¥950,000 total comp (¥580,000 base + ¥370,000 RSU/4yr), and accept no lower than ¥600,000 total comp. For Hong Kong roles, start at HK$1,550,000 total comp (base HK$1,000,000 + RSU HK$550,000), accept no lower than HK$950,000. For Singapore, start at S$260,000 total comp, accept no lower than S$160,000. Push for a performance bonus tied to stablecoin settlement product launch milestones, and negotiate RSU grants at 50-70% of base salary over four years.
