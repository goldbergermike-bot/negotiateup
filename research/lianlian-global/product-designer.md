#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| :cn: Hangzhou (CNY) | ¥250,000 – ¥450,000 | ¥80,000 – ¥200,000 | ¥330,000 – ¥650,000 |
| :hong_kong: Hong Kong (HKD) | HK$420,000 – HK$750,000 | HK$120,000 – HK$300,000 | HK$540,000 – HK$1,050,000 |
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$75,000 – S$130,000 | S$20,000 – S$50,000 | S$95,000 – S$180,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Designers at LianLian Global (HKEX: 2238) shape the merchant and user experience across one of Asia's most complex financial platforms. The Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot introduces entirely new product surfaces — stablecoin settlement dashboards, USDC wallet interfaces, real-time settlement status flows, and cross-currency conversion experiences. The 26.8% revenue growth validates that the Digital Asset strategy is driving merchant adoption, and designers who can translate complex financial infrastructure into intuitive experiences are rare. Your negotiation leverage comes from the ability to bridge both Chinese e-commerce design patterns and global fintech UX conventions for Circle/USDC products.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| LianLian Level | Equivalent Title | Airwallex Equiv. | PingPong Equiv. | WorldFirst Equiv. |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| P5-P6 | Product Designer | Designer IC2-IC3 | UX Designer | L3-L4 Design |
| P7 | Senior Product Designer | Senior Designer IC4 | Senior UX Designer | L5 Design |

LianLian's design function is compact relative to engineering, meaning individual designers carry outsized influence. A single product designer may own the UX for merchant onboarding, settlement dashboards, and compliance flows simultaneously.

Against competitors:
- **Airwallex**: Design compensation in Melbourne/HK is generally 10-15% higher on base, but equity liquidity favors LianLian.
- **PingPong**: Smaller design team, less mature design culture, compensation trails by 10-20%.
- **WorldFirst**: Ant Group design compensation is competitive but equity uncertainty persists.

#### :coin: LianLian Circle/USDC & Digital Asset Lever

LianLian Global's Memorandum of Understanding with **Circle** to integrate USDC **stablecoin** settlement creates an unprecedented design challenge. The **Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot** demands that complex **Digital Asset** interactions feel as simple as traditional payments — and the **26.8% revenue growth** depends on merchant adoption, which depends on design quality.

**Why this matters for Product Designers:**

1. **New Digital Asset Product Surfaces**: The USDC settlement integration creates entirely new UX surfaces — stablecoin wallet management, real-time settlement tracking, cross-currency conversion interfaces, and compliance verification flows. The designer who shapes these experiences defines how merchants across Asia interact with Digital Asset-powered payments.

2. **HKEX: 2238 Public Status**: LianLian's listing means RSU grants — even at the modest levels typical for design roles — vest into tradeable shares with real value.

3. **Digital Asset UX Premium**: Designers who understand both traditional fintech UX patterns and stablecoin/Digital Asset design conventions are extremely rare. Most fintech designers have never designed a stablecoin settlement flow; most crypto designers have never designed for regulated cross-border payments.

4. **Multi-Market Design Complexity**: Designing for Hangzhou merchants, Hong Kong businesses, and Singapore sellers requires cultural and regulatory UX fluency across three distinct markets, all engaging with the Circle/USDC settlement paradigm.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Financial UX Specialization**
> "Designing stablecoin settlement and Digital Asset payment interfaces requires deep domain expertise in financial UX. I bring specific experience designing financial products for regulated markets, directly relevant to LianLian's Circle/USDC integration. This specialization justifies compensation at the upper end of the design band."

**Lever 2: Digital Asset UX Scarcity**
> "The Circle/USDC integration will require designing entirely new stablecoin settlement interfaces. I have experience with both traditional fintech and Digital Asset product design. Designers with this dual fluency are rare — I would like compensation reflecting a 15% premium over standard design offers."

**Lever 3: Multi-Market Design Fluency**
> "Designing a single platform serving merchants across China, Hong Kong, and Singapore — all engaging with LianLian's Stablecoin-Powered Settlement product — requires cultural and regulatory design expertise most designers lack. I am requesting compensation that acknowledges this multi-market scope."

**Lever 4: Design Team Influence**
> "Given LianLian's compact design team and the 26.8% revenue growth driving product expansion, I will carry significant influence over the Digital Asset settlement product design direction. I would like the RSU component to reflect the actual scope of influence I will have."
