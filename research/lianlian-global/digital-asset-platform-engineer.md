### Digital Asset Platform Engineer — LianLian Global Salary Negotiation Guide

## **SIGNATURE ROLE**

> This is the **SIGNATURE ROLE** for the LianLian Global negotiation guide series — the role most directly aligned with the company's Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot, Circle/USDC integration, and 26.8% revenue growth trajectory. This guide is written at extended depth to reflect the strategic centrality of this position.

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes LianLian Global's Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot, translating the 26.8% revenue growth and Circle/USDC integration into a Digital Asset platform engineering compensation framework spanning Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Singapore markets. The Digital Asset Platform Engineer is the single most strategically important technical hire at LianLian Global in 2026 — the engineer who designs, builds, and operates the stablecoin settlement infrastructure that the entire company's growth thesis depends on.

---

#### Why This Is the SIGNATURE ROLE

LianLian Global's transformation from a traditional cross-border payments company into a stablecoin-powered settlement platform hinges on one capability: the ability to build production-grade Digital Asset infrastructure that integrates Circle's USDC stablecoin into LianLian's existing payment rails. The Digital Asset Platform Engineer is the person who makes this happen.

Every other role in this guide series — from Software Engineer to ML/AI Engineer — contributes to the stablecoin settlement vision. But the Digital Asset Platform Engineer *is* the vision. This engineer owns the core stablecoin settlement engine, the Circle API integration layer, the USDC wallet infrastructure, the on-chain/off-chain reconciliation system, and the compliance automation framework that makes it all legal across three jurisdictions. The 26.8% revenue growth trajectory depends on this platform shipping on time, at scale, and with the reliability that a HKEX-listed financial platform demands.

This is why the Digital Asset Platform Engineer commands the highest compensation premium of any engineering role at LianLian, and why this guide provides the most detailed negotiation framework in the series.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| :cn: Hangzhou (CNY) | ¥600,000 – ¥1,000,000 | ¥500,000 – ¥1,000,000 | ¥1,100,000 – ¥2,000,000 |
| :hong_kong: Hong Kong (HKD) | HK$1,000,000 – HK$1,600,000 | HK$700,000 – HK$1,400,000 | HK$1,700,000 – HK$3,000,000 |
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$180,000 – S$280,000 | S$120,000 – S$250,000 | S$300,000 – S$530,000 |

**Compensation Premium Explanation**: The Digital Asset Platform Engineer compensation bands sit 20-35% above standard Staff Software Engineer bands at LianLian. This premium reflects three factors: (1) the extreme scarcity of engineers with production stablecoin settlement experience, (2) the strategic centrality of this role to the 26.8% revenue growth trajectory, and (3) the competitive pressure from Circle, Coinbase, Binance, and other Digital Asset companies actively recruiting the same talent pool in APAC.

**Negotiation DNA**: As the Digital Asset Platform Engineer at LianLian Global (HKEX: 2238), you are not filling a headcount — you are building the platform that justifies LianLian's valuation premium on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Circle/USDC Memorandum of Understanding created the strategic mandate; you are the engineer who converts that mandate into production infrastructure. The Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot is not an experiment — the 26.8% revenue growth demonstrates that merchants are already moving to LianLian's next-generation payment rails. Your negotiation position is anchored in the fact that there are fewer than 100 engineers in APAC who have shipped production stablecoin settlement systems at the transaction volume LianLian processes. You are not competing against generic senior engineers; you are competing against a global talent pool of Digital Asset infrastructure specialists, and your compensation should reflect that market.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| LianLian Level | Equivalent Title | Airwallex Equiv. | Circle Equiv. | Coinbase Equiv. | Stripe Equiv. |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| P8 | Digital Asset Platform Engineer | Staff IC5 | Staff Eng | IC5 / Staff | L4 / Staff |
| P9 | Sr. Digital Asset Platform Eng | Principal IC6 | Principal Eng | IC6 / Principal | L5 / Sr. Staff |
| P10 | Distinguished Platform Eng | Distinguished IC7 | Distinguished | IC7 / Distinguished | L6 / Principal |

The Digital Asset Platform Engineer role at LianLian maps to P8-P10 in the internal leveling system, reflecting the organizational scope and technical complexity. This is the only engineering role at LianLian that benchmarks directly against pure Digital Asset companies (Circle, Coinbase) in addition to traditional cross-border payment competitors.

**Extended Competitive Analysis:**

- **Circle** (direct partner): Circle's own platform engineers earn $200,000-$400,000 USD total comp in the US. LianLian's Digital Asset Platform Engineer works on the same USDC integration from the merchant platform side, making Circle's internal comp a relevant (and high) benchmark. APAC discount is typically 20-30%.

- **Airwallex** (IC5/Staff): Airwallex does not have an equivalent Digital Asset-focused role, which limits direct comparison. Airwallex Staff engineers earn HK$1,500,000-HK$2,500,000 total comp in Hong Kong, but without the Digital Asset premium that LianLian's Circle partnership justifies.

- **Coinbase** (APAC): Coinbase Singapore engineers earn S$250,000-S$450,000 total comp. Coinbase is a direct competitor for Digital Asset talent and sets the upper bound for APAC stablecoin engineering compensation.

- **PingPong** (no equivalent): PingPong does not have a stablecoin settlement initiative and therefore does not have a comparable role. This absence of competition at PingPong further highlights the strategic uniqueness of LianLian's position.

- **WorldFirst** (Ant Group): WorldFirst has explored stablecoin settlement concepts within Ant Group's broader Digital Asset research, but has not deployed production stablecoin infrastructure. No direct equivalent role exists.

- **Stripe** (Singapore, L4/Staff): Stripe Singapore staff engineers earn S$350,000-S$500,000 total comp. Stripe has crypto-native payment capabilities (crypto onramp/offramp), making it a partial benchmark for Digital Asset platform work.

#### :coin: LianLian Circle/USDC & Digital Asset Lever

This is the definitive section for this **SIGNATURE ROLE**. The Digital Asset Platform Engineer exists because of the Circle/USDC partnership, and the Circle/USDC partnership delivers value because of the Digital Asset Platform Engineer. They are inseparable.

**The Stablecoin-Powered Settlement Pivot — Full Context:**

LianLian Global's Memorandum of Understanding with **Circle** — the issuer of the **USDC stablecoin** — commits the company to building USDC-based settlement into its cross-border payment infrastructure. This is not an incremental feature addition. It is a fundamental reimagining of how cross-border payments work:

- **Traditional settlement** (pre-Circle): Merchant in China sells product to customer in Europe. Payment flows through correspondent banking chain — originating bank, intermediary banks, receiving bank — taking 3-5 business days with 2-4% in cumulative fees. Each intermediary takes a cut. Settlement timing is unpredictable.

- **Stablecoin-Powered Settlement** (post-Circle): Same merchant, same customer. Payment is converted to USDC at origination, transmitted on-chain in minutes, and converted to destination currency at the receiving end. Settlement is near-instant. Fees are reduced by 40-60%. The entire correspondent banking chain is bypassed.

The **26.8% revenue growth** in 2025 demonstrates that LianLian is already capturing merchant demand for faster, cheaper cross-border settlement. The Circle/USDC integration accelerates this by providing the most trusted stablecoin in the world as the settlement medium.

**Why the Digital Asset Platform Engineer is the lynchpin:**

1. **USDC Settlement Engine Architecture**: You design and build the core settlement engine that converts fiat to USDC, transmits USDC across chains, and converts back to destination fiat. This engine must handle millions of transactions per day with financial-grade accuracy and compliance. Every dollar of the 26.8% revenue growth flows through this system.

2. **Circle API Integration Layer**: You own the integration with Circle's APIs — minting USDC, redeeming USDC, treasury management, and settlement finality. This is a deep technical partnership, not a simple API call. The Circle MOU creates joint obligations that require engineering collaboration at the protocol level.

3. **On-Chain/Off-Chain Reconciliation**: The hardest technical challenge in stablecoin settlement is reconciling on-chain transaction records with off-chain banking records. Every discrepancy is a potential financial loss or compliance violation. You build the reconciliation system that ensures LianLian's books are accurate to the penny across both settlement paradigms.

4. **USDC Wallet Infrastructure**: Merchant wallets, treasury wallets, settlement wallets, and compliance escrow wallets — all must be designed with enterprise-grade key management, multi-signature authorization, and disaster recovery. A single key management failure could result in catastrophic loss of merchant funds.

5. **Compliance Automation Framework**: USDC settlement across PRC, Hong Kong, and Singapore requires real-time compliance screening — sanctions checking, AML transaction monitoring, KYC verification, and regulatory reporting — that satisfies three different regulatory regimes simultaneously. The Digital Asset Platform Engineer builds the compliance automation layer that makes this possible at transaction speed.

6. **Multi-Chain Interoperability**: USDC exists on multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Base, etc.). The settlement platform must support cross-chain settlement routing that optimizes for cost, speed, and reliability. This requires deep blockchain infrastructure expertise.

7. **Real-Time Settlement Analytics**: The platform must provide real-time visibility into settlement status, transaction history, fee accounting, and error resolution. This analytics layer directly impacts merchant satisfaction and the 26.8% revenue retention.

**The Digital Asset Premium — Quantified:**

- **Base premium**: 20-35% above standard staff engineer compensation at LianLian or peer companies
- **Signing bonus premium**: 2-4 months' base salary (reflecting urgency and talent scarcity)
- **RSU premium**: Larger initial grant to compensate for the flight risk to pure Digital Asset companies (Circle, Coinbase, Binance)
- **Refresh grant premium**: Guaranteed Year 2 refresh grants to prevent mid-buildout attrition

The Digital Asset premium is not theoretical. It is driven by measurable market dynamics:
- Fewer than 100 engineers in APAC have production stablecoin settlement experience at LianLian's scale
- Circle, Coinbase, and Binance are all aggressively hiring in APAC with USD-denominated compensation
- The 26.8% revenue growth creates board-level pressure to fill this role immediately
- Every month of delay in filling this role delays the Circle integration, which delays revenue that the HKEX: 2238 stock price has already priced in

#### Strategic Positioning: Why LianLian Over Pure Digital Asset Companies

When negotiating, you should understand — and articulate — why LianLian's offer should be competitive with pure Digital Asset companies while offering unique advantages:

**LianLian advantages over Circle (direct partner):**
- You build on the *merchant platform* side, which means you see the full end-to-end settlement flow, not just the stablecoin protocol layer
- LianLian's existing merchant base (serving Alibaba, Temu, Shein, JD ecosystem) provides immediate transaction volume — you are not building for hypothetical usage
- HKEX: 2238 RSU liquidity is comparable to Circle's (Circle is also public via NYSE)
- You gain exposure to Chinese e-commerce infrastructure, which is a career differentiator

**LianLian advantages over Coinbase/Binance:**
- LianLian operates in regulated cross-border payments, which is more career-stable than exchange-based crypto
- The stablecoin settlement use case is less volatile than exchange trading infrastructure
- HKEX listing provides regulatory legitimacy that some Digital Asset companies lack in APAC
- The 26.8% revenue growth is driven by real merchant payments, not speculative trading volume

**LianLian advantages over Airwallex/Stripe:**
- LianLian has a signed Circle MOU for stablecoin settlement — Airwallex and Stripe do not
- The Digital Asset Platform Engineer role does not exist at Airwallex or Stripe, meaning LianLian offers unique career positioning
- LianLian's focus on Chinese e-commerce cross-border payments is a differentiated market position

#### Global Levers — Extended for SIGNATURE ROLE

**Lever 1: Platform Ownership of the Core Revenue Engine**
> "The Digital Asset settlement platform I would build is the core engine driving LianLian's 26.8% revenue growth and the entire Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot. Every cross-border transaction that uses Circle/USDC settlement flows through this platform. I am not building a feature — I am building the revenue engine. My compensation should reflect that I own the most strategically important platform at a HKEX-listed company."

**Lever 2: Global Digital Asset Talent Competition**
> "I am actively interviewing with Circle, Coinbase, and Binance for comparable Digital Asset platform engineering roles. These companies offer USD-denominated compensation packages in the $300,000-$500,000 range. LianLian's unique advantage is the combination of real merchant payment volume, HKEX RSU liquidity, and the ability to build stablecoin settlement from the merchant platform side. But my total compensation needs to be competitive with the Digital Asset market — not the traditional payments market."

**Lever 3: Scarcity-Based Premium**
> "There are fewer than 100 engineers in APAC who have shipped production stablecoin settlement systems at the transaction volume LianLian processes. I am one of them. The 26.8% revenue growth trajectory depends on hiring someone with my exact skill set, and the Circle MOU timeline creates urgency that further narrows your options. I expect my compensation to reflect this scarcity — specifically, a 25-35% premium over standard P8 compensation."

**Lever 4: RSU Grant as Retention Mechanism**
> "The Digital Asset settlement platform is a multi-year buildout. Losing the platform engineer mid-buildout would be catastrophic for the Circle integration timeline and the 26.8% revenue growth trajectory. I want an RSU grant structured to retain me through the critical delivery phases — specifically, a front-loaded vesting schedule or a guaranteed Year 2 refresh grant that rewards me for staying through the most difficult execution period."

**Lever 5: Signing Bonus as Opportunity Cost Compensation**
> "By joining LianLian, I am leaving guaranteed compensation at my current employer and declining competing Digital Asset offers. The opportunity cost of this transition is measurable. I am requesting a signing bonus of 3-4 months' base salary to compensate for this transition cost and to demonstrate LianLian's commitment to the Digital Asset platform hire."

**Lever 6: Scope-Based Title and Compensation Alignment**
> "The scope of the Digital Asset Platform Engineer role — owning the stablecoin settlement engine, Circle API integration, wallet infrastructure, compliance automation, and cross-chain interoperability — exceeds typical Staff Engineer scope. At most companies, this would be a Principal or Distinguished Engineer role. I am open to a Staff-level title, but I expect the compensation to align with the actual scope, not the title."

**Lever 7: Board-Level Visibility Premium**
> "The Digital Asset settlement platform is a board-level initiative at LianLian. The HKEX: 2238 stock price reflects investor expectations about the Circle/USDC integration. As the engineer accountable for this platform, I have direct impact on stock price performance. I expect my compensation — particularly the RSU component — to reflect this board-level visibility and accountability."

**Lever 8: Multi-Region Impact**
> "The stablecoin settlement platform serves merchants across Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Singapore, navigating three distinct regulatory environments. This multi-region scope, combined with the Digital Asset complexity and the 26.8% revenue growth stakes, creates a role that has no true equivalent in APAC fintech. My compensation should reflect the uniqueness and strategic weight of this position."

#### Negotiation Playbook: Step-by-Step for the SIGNATURE ROLE

**Phase 1: Research and Positioning (Before the Offer)**
- Collect competing offers from Circle, Coinbase, Stripe, or Airwallex. Even a recruiter conversation with preliminary ranges gives you leverage.
- Identify LianLian's Circle/USDC integration timeline and any public statements about delivery milestones. Use these to quantify urgency.
- Research HKEX: 2238 stock performance and analyst coverage. If analysts have priced in the stablecoin settlement revenue, that creates additional leverage.

**Phase 2: Initial Offer Response**
- Never accept the first offer. Express genuine enthusiasm for the Circle/USDC mission and the Digital Asset platform opportunity, then request 48-72 hours to evaluate.
- During the evaluation period, prepare your counter-offer using the levers above.

**Phase 3: Counter-Offer Presentation**
- Lead with Lever 1 (Platform Ownership) and Lever 3 (Scarcity). These establish the strategic value frame.
- Follow with Lever 2 (Global Competition) to anchor your ask against Digital Asset market compensation, not traditional fintech.
- Use Lever 5 (Signing Bonus) and Lever 4 (RSU Retention) as negotiation chips — these are often easier for the company to approve than base salary increases.

**Phase 4: Final Negotiation**
- If the company pushes back on base salary, shift to RSU grants, signing bonus, and refresh grant commitments. LianLian's HKEX listing makes RSU increases more defensible internally.
- If the company pushes back on total comp, negotiate for scope commitments (guaranteed headcount for your platform team, direct report to VP/CTO, budget authority for Digital Asset infrastructure).
- Always get the final offer in writing, including RSU vesting schedule, refresh grant commitments, and any milestone-based bonuses.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For the SIGNATURE ROLE Digital Asset Platform Engineer in Hong Kong, start your ask at HK$2,800,000 total comp (base HK$1,500,000 + RSU HK$1,300,000 over 4 years). Accept no lower than HK$1,900,000 total comp (base HK$1,150,000 + RSU HK$750,000). For Hangzhou, start at ¥1,850,000 total comp (base ¥950,000 + RSU ¥900,000), accept no lower than ¥1,250,000. For Singapore, start at S$500,000 total comp (base S$270,000 + RSU S$230,000), accept no lower than S$330,000. Negotiate a signing bonus of 3-4 months' base salary (HK$375,000-HK$500,000 in Hong Kong). Push for a guaranteed Year 2 RSU refresh grant of at least 30% of the initial grant. Request a dedicated Digital Asset infrastructure budget and at least one direct report within 6 months of joining.

#### Career Trajectory and Long-Term Value

The Digital Asset Platform Engineer at LianLian is not just a role — it is a career-defining platform. Consider the long-term trajectory:

- **Year 1**: Build and launch the core Circle/USDC settlement engine. Ship the foundational stablecoin settlement infrastructure.
- **Year 2**: Scale the platform to handle full merchant volume migration. Optimize settlement costs and speed. Begin cross-chain expansion.
- **Year 3-4**: Own a platform processing billions in stablecoin settlement volume. Your RSUs vest into stock whose value you have directly influenced. Your resume now includes "built the stablecoin settlement platform at a HKEX-listed payments company processing $X billion annually."

This career trajectory is available at very few companies globally. LianLian's combination of real merchant volume, Circle partnership, and HKEX listing creates a unique platform for building career-defining Digital Asset infrastructure.

---

#### Risk Factors to Negotiate Around

**Risk 1: Regulatory Uncertainty**
Stablecoin regulation in PRC, Hong Kong, and Singapore is evolving. Negotiate for a regulatory risk clause in your offer — if the Circle/USDC integration is paused or cancelled due to regulatory changes, you want guaranteed severance or role redeployment within LianLian.

**Risk 2: Stock Price Volatility**
HKEX: 2238 stock price may fluctuate. Negotiate for a stock price protection mechanism on your RSU grant — either a floor price guarantee on vesting or an additional cash bonus if the stock trades below the grant price at vesting.

**Risk 3: Platform Scope Reduction**
If LianLian reduces investment in the stablecoin settlement platform, your role scope shrinks. Negotiate for a scope commitment in your offer letter — specific deliverables, team size commitments, and budget authority that protect your role's strategic importance.
