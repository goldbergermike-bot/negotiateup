### Senior Software Engineer — LianLian Global Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes LianLian Global's Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot, translating the 26.8% revenue growth and Circle/USDC integration into a senior software engineering compensation framework spanning Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Singapore markets.

---

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| :cn: Hangzhou (CNY) | ¥400,000 – ¥650,000 | ¥200,000 – ¥500,000 | ¥600,000 – ¥1,150,000 |
| :hong_kong: Hong Kong (HKD) | HK$650,000 – HK$1,000,000 | HK$300,000 – HK$700,000 | HK$950,000 – HK$1,700,000 |
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$110,000 – S$170,000 | S$50,000 – S$120,000 | S$160,000 – S$290,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Senior Software Engineers at LianLian Global (HKEX: 2238) are the technical backbone of the Circle/USDC integration initiative. The Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot requires senior engineers to design system architectures, lead implementation sprints, and mentor junior engineers on blockchain-payment hybrid systems. At this level, you are making design decisions that will determine whether LianLian captures the stablecoin settlement market across Asia-Pacific — fueled by the 26.8% revenue growth that validates the commercial thesis. This architectural ownership creates substantial leverage. LianLian's HKEX: 2238 listing makes your RSU compensation liquid and transparent, a significant advantage when negotiating against private fintech competitors.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| LianLian Level | Equivalent Title | Airwallex Equiv. | PingPong Equiv. | WorldFirst Equiv. |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| P7 | Senior Software Engineer | IC4 / Senior SWE | Senior SDE | L5 |
| P8 | Staff / Principal Engineer | IC5 / Staff | Lead SDE | L6 |

LianLian's P7 band is the primary Senior Software Engineer level, with P8 reserved for strong seniors approaching staff-level impact. Compensation at P7 benchmarks 10-20% above Alibaba's equivalent level for payments-domain specialists, reflecting the scarcity of engineers who combine high-scale distributed systems expertise with payment regulatory knowledge.

Against cross-border payment competitors:
- **Airwallex** (IC4, Melbourne/HK): Base salary is comparable in HK, but RSU liquidity is limited (pre-IPO). Airwallex may offer higher paper equity value, but LianLian's public-market RSUs have concrete daily-traded value.
- **PingPong** (Senior SDE, Hangzhou): Base is within 10% of LianLian's Hangzhou range, but PingPong remains private with no clear IPO timeline. Equity comparison heavily favors LianLian.
- **WorldFirst** (L5, Shanghai/HK): Comparable base, but restricted stock is tied to Ant Group, which faces ongoing regulatory uncertainty around its IPO.

#### :coin: LianLian Circle/USDC & Digital Asset Lever

LianLian Global's strategic partnership with **Circle** — formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding — positions the company as the first HKEX-listed cross-border payments company to offer stablecoin-powered settlement at scale. The **Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot** is validated by the **26.8% revenue growth**, which demonstrates that the **Digital Asset** integration strategy is driving real commercial momentum.

**Why this matters for Senior Software Engineers:**

1. **Architecture Ownership**: Senior engineers will own the system design of the USDC settlement layer — including wallet management, on-chain/off-chain reconciliation, real-time FX conversion, and compliance rule engines. This is greenfield architecture work at the intersection of payments and the Digital Asset ecosystem, commanding a significant market premium.

2. **HKEX: 2238 Public Status**: LianLian's listing provides RSU grants with immediate market value. For a senior engineer receiving ¥300,000-¥500,000 in RSUs over four years, this translates to a tangible, tradeable asset — unlike equity at private competitors.

3. **Digital Asset Premium**: The market for engineers who can design settlement systems bridging traditional banking rails and stablecoin protocols is extremely thin. Recruiters report that candidates with this dual skill set command a 20-35% premium over pure payments or pure blockchain engineers. The Circle/USDC partnership and 26.8% revenue growth make this premium directly relevant to your negotiation.

4. **Stablecoin Settlement Paradigm**: The Circle MOU is the foundation for a new settlement paradigm. Senior engineers working on this platform gain exposure to both China's digital payment infrastructure and Hong Kong's progressive stablecoin licensing framework — a career-differentiating combination.

**How to use this lever**: Position yourself as someone who understands both the payments and Digital Asset sides of the integration. Emphasize that your ability to accelerate delivery timelines on the Circle/USDC stablecoin settlement platform justifies premium compensation backed by the 26.8% revenue growth.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Circle/USDC Delivery Premium**
> "The Circle/USDC integration sets aggressive milestones for the Stablecoin-Powered Settlement platform. As a senior engineer, I would be responsible for designing and delivering core Digital Asset settlement infrastructure on a compressed timeline. The 26.8% revenue growth validates the urgency. I would like compensation that includes an accelerated vesting component or signing bonus reflecting the strategic importance of this initiative."

**Lever 2: Architectural Scarcity**
> "Designing settlement systems that bridge traditional payment rails and USDC stablecoin protocols requires a very specific Digital Asset skill set. I bring experience in both distributed payment systems and blockchain-based settlement. This dual expertise is rare in the market — my conversations with other companies confirm that total compensation for this profile ranges 20-30% above standard senior SWE offers."

**Lever 3: Public Equity vs. Private Equity Tradeoff**
> "I value that LianLian's HKEX: 2238 listing gives RSUs real liquidity. However, I have a competing offer from a late-stage private fintech offering a larger equity package on paper. For me to choose LianLian's liquid RSUs, the total compensation needs to be competitive. I am targeting a minimum RSU grant of [X] over four years."

**Lever 4: Regional Arbitrage**
> "I am flexible on location between Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Singapore. If the role is based in Hong Kong or Singapore, I expect the compensation to reflect the 40-60% cost-of-living premium. I would also like to discuss hybrid arrangements that could optimize for both LianLian's needs and compensation efficiency."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Hangzhou-based Senior SWE roles, start your ask at ¥1,000,000 total comp (¥600,000 base + ¥400,000 RSU/4yr), and accept no lower than ¥700,000 total comp. For Hong Kong roles, start at HK$1,600,000 total comp (base HK$1,000,000 + RSU HK$600,000), accept no lower than HK$1,100,000. For Singapore, start at S$270,000 total comp, accept no lower than S$185,000. Push for a signing bonus of 1-2 months' base salary citing the Circle/USDC integration urgency and the 26.8% growth trajectory, and negotiate for accelerated first-year RSU vesting.
