#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| :cn: Hangzhou (CNY) | ¥600,000 – ¥950,000 | ¥400,000 – ¥900,000 | ¥1,000,000 – ¥1,850,000 |
| :hong_kong: Hong Kong (HKD) | HK$950,000 – HK$1,500,000 | HK$600,000 – HK$1,200,000 | HK$1,550,000 – HK$2,700,000 |
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$160,000 – S$250,000 | S$100,000 – S$200,000 | S$260,000 – S$450,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Staff Software Engineers at LianLian Global (HKEX: 2238) operate at the organizational architecture level — defining technical direction for entire platform domains, influencing engineering culture, and making decisions that compound across teams. The Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot and 26.8% revenue growth create an urgent mandate to build Digital Asset settlement infrastructure. At this level, you are not negotiating based on market rates for "a staff engineer" — you are negotiating based on your ability to de-risk a multi-hundred-million-dollar strategic initiative centered on Circle/USDC integration. LianLian's HKEX: 2238 listing ensures that significant RSU grants at this level have real, tradeable value.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| LianLian Level | Equivalent Title | Airwallex Equiv. | PingPong Equiv. | WorldFirst Equiv. |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| P8 | Staff Software Engineer | IC5 / Staff | Principal SDE | L6 |
| P9 | Principal Engineer | IC6 / Principal | Distinguished SDE | L7 |

At P8-P9, LianLian's compensation philosophy shifts toward equity-heavy packages. RSUs typically constitute 40-50% of total compensation at the staff level. The HKEX listing makes these large RSU grants genuinely valuable — a ¥800,000 RSU grant over four years represents HK$880,000+ in tradeable stock.

Against cross-border payment competitors:
- **Airwallex** (IC5, Staff): Higher paper equity, but pre-IPO illiquidity means a 30-50% discount on expected value. LianLian's public RSUs trade at face value.
- **PingPong** (Principal SDE): Does not consistently staff at true staff-engineer level; most senior ICs operate as tech leads without organizational scope.
- **WorldFirst** (L6): Ant Group's internal compensation for L6 is competitive on base, but restricted stock is subject to Ant's regulatory overhang.
- **Stripe** (L4/Staff, Singapore): Stripe Singapore staff engineers earn S$350,000-S$500,000 total comp, setting the upper bound.

#### :coin: LianLian Circle/USDC & Digital Asset Lever

LianLian Global's strategic Memorandum of Understanding with **Circle** is the most significant Digital Asset infrastructure deployment by a publicly listed Asian payments company. The **Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot** is validated by **26.8% revenue growth**, and the HKEX: 2238 listing provides the financial transparency to verify it. For a Staff Software Engineer, this is the single most powerful negotiation lever available.

**Why this matters for Staff Software Engineers:**

1. **Platform Architecture Authority**: The USDC integration requires rethinking LianLian's entire settlement architecture — from ledger systems to treasury management to regulatory reporting. A staff engineer will own the technical vision for how stablecoin rails coexist with traditional banking infrastructure. This is a once-in-a-career opportunity to architect a category-defining **Digital Asset** platform.

2. **HKEX: 2238 Public Status**: At the staff level, RSU grants of ¥500,000-¥900,000 over four years are standard. LianLian's HKEX listing means these grants vest into shares traded on a major global exchange. A comparable equity grant at a private competitor carries 30-50% illiquidity discount — making LianLian's ¥700,000 RSU grant worth more than a ¥1,000,000 private equity grant.

3. **Digital Asset Premium**: Staff engineers who can architect multi-protocol settlement systems combining SWIFT, local ACH, and USDC settlement are among the rarest profiles in fintech. The market has fewer than a few hundred engineers globally with true staff-level experience across both traditional payments and **stablecoin** settlement. This scarcity justifies a 25-40% premium.

4. **Strategic Bridge Role**: LianLian uniquely bridges the Chinese e-commerce ecosystem with global stablecoin settlement rails. A staff engineer shapes how billions of dollars in cross-border merchant payments migrate from legacy correspondent banking to instant USDC settlement — the foundation for a new settlement paradigm powered by Circle/USDC.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Platform Architecture De-risking**
> "The Circle/USDC integration is LianLian's most strategically important Digital Asset initiative. As a staff engineer, my role is to de-risk this Stablecoin-Powered Settlement buildout by establishing the right architectural foundations. The 26.8% revenue growth proves the market demand. I am targeting total comp in the top quartile of the P8 band."

**Lever 2: Illiquidity-Adjusted Equity Comparison**
> "I am comparing LianLian's offer against a late-stage private fintech offering a larger equity package on paper. LianLian's HKEX-listed RSUs have zero illiquidity discount. To make a fair comparison, I need LianLian's RSU grant to represent at least 70% of the nominal private equity offer."

**Lever 3: Organizational Leverage Premium**
> "At the staff level, my impact is measured by how many teams I unblock and how much technical risk I retire. In my previous role, I led the architectural redesign of [X system], which reduced incident rate by Y% and enabled Z teams to ship independently. I am targeting the upper range of the P8 band."

**Lever 4: Retention and Refresh Grants**
> "Given the multi-year nature of the stablecoin settlement buildout, I want to discuss not just the initial RSU grant but the refresh grant philosophy. I am looking for annual RSU refresh grants of at least 25-30% of the initial grant to ensure my compensation remains competitive as the Digital Asset platform scales."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Hangzhou-based Staff SWE roles, start your ask at ¥1,700,000 total comp (¥850,000 base + ¥850,000 RSU/4yr), and accept no lower than ¥1,100,000 total comp. For Hong Kong roles, start at HK$2,500,000 total comp (base HK$1,400,000 + RSU HK$1,100,000), accept no lower than HK$1,650,000. For Singapore, start at S$420,000 total comp, accept no lower than S$280,000. Negotiate for a signing bonus equal to 2-3 months' base salary, and push for a guaranteed first-year RSU refresh grant.
