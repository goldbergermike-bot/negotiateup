### Engineering Manager — LianLian Global Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes LianLian Global's Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot, translating the 26.8% revenue growth and Circle/USDC integration into an engineering management compensation framework spanning Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Singapore markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| :cn: Hangzhou (CNY) | ¥500,000 – ¥850,000 | ¥300,000 – ¥700,000 | ¥800,000 – ¥1,550,000 |
| :hong_kong: Hong Kong (HKD) | HK$800,000 – HK$1,350,000 | HK$450,000 – HK$900,000 | HK$1,250,000 – HK$2,250,000 |
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$140,000 – S$220,000 | S$80,000 – S$160,000 | S$220,000 – S$380,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering Managers at LianLian Global (HKEX: 2238) are responsible for building and scaling the teams that deliver the Circle/USDC stablecoin settlement integration. The Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot does not just create a technical buildout — it creates an organizational buildout. The 26.8% revenue growth means aggressive hiring, and LianLian needs EMs who can recruit rapidly in a competitive Digital Asset talent market, retain senior talent through RSU-based compensation design, and coordinate cross-functional delivery across Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Your negotiation leverage comes from the fact that team-building is the critical path for the Circle integration timeline.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| LianLian Level | Equivalent Title | Airwallex Equiv. | PingPong Equiv. | WorldFirst Equiv. |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| M1 (P7-eq) | Engineering Manager | EM / M1 | Dev Manager | L5-M |
| M2 (P8-eq) | Senior EM / Director | Senior EM / M2 | Senior Dev Manager | L6-M |

LianLian uses a dual-track system where management levels (M-series) map to equivalent IC levels (P-series) for compensation benchmarking. An M1 Engineering Manager is compensated at P7-P8 equivalent, with the expectation of managing 6-12 engineers and owning delivery for a platform domain.

Against competitors:
- **Airwallex** (EM, M1): Comparable base in Hong Kong, but pre-IPO equity carries illiquidity risk. LianLian's public RSUs are immediately more tangible.
- **PingPong** (Dev Manager): Management compensation in Hangzhou trails LianLian by 10-15% due to smaller scale.
- **WorldFirst** (L5-M): Ant Group management roles carry competitive base but uncertain RSU liquidity.

#### :coin: LianLian Circle/USDC & Digital Asset Lever

LianLian Global's Memorandum of Understanding with **Circle** to integrate USDC **stablecoin** settlement into its cross-border payment platform creates both a delivery challenge and a career-defining opportunity for Engineering Managers. The **Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot** is backed by **26.8% revenue growth**, and the **Digital Asset** integration roadmap requires significant team scaling.

**Why this matters for Engineering Managers:**

1. **Team Scaling Mandate**: The Circle/USDC integration requires LianLian to scale its engineering organization significantly. EMs who can recruit, onboard, and retain engineers with payments and Digital Asset expertise are directly enabling the company's most important strategic initiative.

2. **HKEX: 2238 Public Status**: LianLian's HKEX listing gives EMs a powerful recruiting tool — liquid RSUs. When competing against private fintechs for senior talent, publicly-traded equity is a decisive advantage for hiring stablecoin infrastructure engineers.

3. **Digital Asset Premium**: EMs who have experience managing teams that build across traditional payment and blockchain/stablecoin infrastructure are rare. The market has payments EMs and crypto EMs — but very few who can bridge both worlds for the Circle/USDC integration.

4. **Cross-Regional Coordination**: The stablecoin settlement platform spans Hangzhou (core engineering), Hong Kong (regulatory alignment), and Singapore (APAC expansion). EMs managing distributed teams across these sites command a premium.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Team Velocity and Delivery Acceleration**
> "The Circle/USDC integration has aggressive milestones tied to the Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot. My track record shows I can build and scale engineering teams rapidly — I grew my team from [X] to [Y] in [Z] months while maintaining delivery velocity. Given the 26.8% revenue growth driving urgency, I am targeting the upper half of the M1 band."

**Lever 2: Hybrid Payments-Digital Asset Management**
> "I have managed teams that built both traditional payment infrastructure and Digital Asset systems. This hybrid management experience is directly aligned with LianLian's Circle/USDC integration. Very few EMs have this combination — I am asking for a 20% premium over standard EM offers."

**Lever 3: Recruiting Leverage Through Public Equity**
> "I plan to use LianLian's HKEX-listed RSUs as a key recruiting tool for the stablecoin settlement engineers I hire. My own compensation should demonstrate that LianLian's equity is meaningful. I am requesting an RSU grant constituting at least 40% of total comp."

**Lever 4: Cross-Regional Management Premium**
> "Managing engineering teams across Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Singapore requires navigating different labor markets, regulatory environments, and cultures for the Digital Asset platform. This cross-regional scope exceeds single-site EM roles. I am looking for a 10-15% premium over single-site benchmarks."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Hangzhou-based EM roles, start your ask at ¥1,400,000 total comp (¥750,000 base + ¥650,000 RSU/4yr), and accept no lower than ¥900,000 total comp. For Hong Kong roles, start at HK$2,100,000 total comp (base HK$1,250,000 + RSU HK$850,000), accept no lower than HK$1,350,000. For Singapore, start at S$360,000 total comp, accept no lower than S$240,000. Negotiate for a signing bonus of 2 months' base salary and push for a guaranteed headcount commitment tied to the stablecoin settlement platform roadmap.
