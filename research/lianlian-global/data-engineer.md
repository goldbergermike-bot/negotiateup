### Data Engineer — LianLian Global Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes LianLian Global's Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot, translating the 26.8% revenue growth and Circle/USDC integration into a data engineering compensation framework spanning Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Singapore markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| :cn: Hangzhou (CNY) | ¥280,000 – ¥520,000 | ¥100,000 – ¥280,000 | ¥380,000 – ¥800,000 |
| :hong_kong: Hong Kong (HKD) | HK$480,000 – HK$850,000 | HK$180,000 – HK$400,000 | HK$660,000 – HK$1,250,000 |
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$85,000 – S$145,000 | S$28,000 – S$70,000 | S$113,000 – S$215,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Engineers at LianLian Global (HKEX: 2238) build the pipelines, warehouses, and real-time streaming infrastructure powering every analytical, compliance, and operational decision. The Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot introduces a fundamentally new data source — on-chain USDC transaction data from the Circle/USDC integration — that must be ingested, transformed, reconciled with traditional payment data, and made available for analytics, fraud detection, and regulatory reporting. The 26.8% revenue growth generates more transaction data volume, and data engineers who can build hybrid Digital Asset data pipelines merging blockchain event streams with traditional databases are rare and highly valuable.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| LianLian Level | Equivalent Title | Airwallex Equiv. | PingPong Equiv. | WorldFirst Equiv. |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| P5-P6 | Data Engineer | DE IC2-IC3 | Data Engineer | L3-L4 DE |
| P7 | Senior Data Engineer | Senior DE IC4 | Senior DE | L5 DE |
| P8 | Staff / Lead Data Engineer | Staff DE IC5 | Lead DE | L6 DE |

LianLian's data infrastructure spans Alibaba Cloud data services (MaxCompute, DataWorks) in mainland China and open-source/AWS-based infrastructure (Spark, Kafka, Airflow, Redshift) internationally. Data engineers must be fluent across both ecosystems.

Against competitors:
- **Airwallex**: DE compensation is competitive in Hong Kong/Melbourne, but pre-IPO equity carries illiquidity discount.
- **PingPong**: Smaller data team, less mature infrastructure, compensation trails by 10-15%.
- **WorldFirst**: Ant Group has a large DE org leveraging Alibaba's infrastructure, but individual scope may be narrower.
- **Grab** (Singapore): Grab DE roles earn S$130,000-S$220,000 total comp, providing an APAC benchmark.

#### :coin: LianLian Circle/USDC & Digital Asset Lever

LianLian Global's Memorandum of Understanding with **Circle** to integrate USDC **stablecoin** settlement introduces a transformative new data domain. The **Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot**, backed by **26.8% revenue growth**, requires Data Engineers who can build the **Digital Asset** data infrastructure layer.

**Why this matters for Data Engineers:**

1. **On-Chain Digital Asset Data Ingestion**: USDC settlement generates blockchain transaction data — on-chain events, wallet state changes, settlement confirmations, and gas fee records. Data engineers must build real-time pipelines ingesting this stablecoin data, enriching it with off-chain payment metadata, and making it queryable.

2. **HKEX: 2238 Public Status**: LianLian's listing means RSU grants have market-price liquidity. For data engineers comparing offers against large tech companies with public equity, LianLian's listing places it in the same category.

3. **Digital Asset Premium**: Data engineers who can build pipelines merging blockchain event streams with traditional SQL/NoSQL transaction data for the Circle/USDC platform are in very short supply. This hybrid skill set commands a 15-25% premium.

4. **Regulatory Data Infrastructure**: Stablecoin settlement requires comprehensive audit trails for HKMA, MAS, and PRC regulators. Data engineers building data lineage tracking, immutable audit logs, and regulatory reporting pipelines for the Digital Asset platform add high value to the 26.8% growth trajectory.

5. **Real-Time Stablecoin Settlement Analytics**: USDC settlement enables near-instant confirmation, creating demand for real-time streaming and analytics (Kafka, Flink) that directly support the settlement platform.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Hybrid Digital Asset Pipeline Scarcity**
> "The Circle/USDC integration requires data pipelines merging on-chain blockchain data with traditional payment data for the Stablecoin-Powered Settlement platform. I have experience building hybrid data architectures. This Digital Asset skill set is very scarce — I am targeting a 15-20% premium over standard data engineering offers."

**Lever 2: Real-Time Streaming Expertise**
> "USDC stablecoin settlement requires real-time data streaming infrastructure supporting the 26.8% revenue growth. I have production experience with Kafka, Flink, and real-time pipelines at scale. For a Digital Asset settlement platform where latency directly impacts merchant experience, I am asking for upper-range compensation."

**Lever 3: Multi-Cloud Data Infrastructure**
> "LianLian operates across Alibaba Cloud and AWS/GCP for the stablecoin settlement platform. I have experience with data engineering across both Chinese and Western cloud ecosystems. This dual-cloud fluency for Digital Asset data is rare and should be reflected in my compensation."

**Lever 4: Regulatory Data Engineering**
> "Building compliant data pipelines for the Circle/USDC stablecoin platform across PRC, Hong Kong, and Singapore — audit trails, data lineage, and compliance reporting — requires specialized Digital Asset data engineering expertise. This reduces LianLian's regulatory risk and justifies a premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Hangzhou-based data engineering roles, start your ask at ¥730,000 total comp (¥460,000 base + ¥270,000 RSU/4yr), and accept no lower than ¥440,000 total comp. For Hong Kong roles, start at HK$1,150,000 total comp (base HK$800,000 + RSU HK$350,000), accept no lower than HK$730,000. For Singapore, start at S$200,000 total comp, accept no lower than S$130,000. Negotiate for RSU grants at 45-55% of base over four years, and push for a data engineering conference and training budget of $3,000-$5,000 annually.
