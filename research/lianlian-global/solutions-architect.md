**Negotiation DNA**: Solutions Architects at LianLian Global (HKEX: 2238) bridge engineering capability and merchant business needs — designing the integration patterns, API architectures, and settlement workflows that enable merchants to connect to LianLian's cross-border payment platform. The Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot fundamentally changes the solution landscape: merchants now have a stablecoin settlement option alongside traditional bank settlement, powered by Circle/USDC. The 26.8% revenue growth depends on merchant adoption, and Solutions Architects who can design integration architectures supporting both settlement modes — traditional FX and USDC-based Digital Asset settlement — while navigating multi-jurisdictional regulatory constraints are exceptionally valuable.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| LianLian Level | Equivalent Title | Airwallex Equiv. | PingPong Equiv. | WorldFirst Equiv. |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| P7 | Solutions Architect | SA / Senior SA | Solutions Engineer | L5 SA |
| P8 | Senior / Principal SA | Principal SA | Lead SE | L6 SA |

Solutions Architects at LianLian function as technical pre-sales, integration design, and architecture advisory combined. They work directly with enterprise merchants, e-commerce platform partners, and payment aggregators to design bespoke integration architectures.

Against competitors:
- **Airwallex**: SA compensation is strong in Hong Kong/Melbourne, but pre-IPO equity carries illiquidity risk.
- **PingPong**: Solutions Engineering is less formalized; compensation trails by 15-20%.
- **WorldFirst**: SA roles carry Ant Group-competitive base but uncertain equity.
- **Adyen** (Singapore): Adyen SAs earn S$200,000-S$350,000 total comp, providing an upper benchmark.

#### :coin: LianLian Circle/USDC & Digital Asset Lever

LianLian Global's Memorandum of Understanding with **Circle** to integrate USDC **stablecoin** settlement creates entirely new solution design challenges. The **Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot**, validated by **26.8% revenue growth**, requires Solutions Architects who can advise merchants on **Digital Asset** settlement options and design dual-mode integration architectures.

**Why this matters for Solutions Architects:**

1. **Dual-Mode Settlement Design**: Merchants need integration architectures supporting both traditional bank settlement and USDC stablecoin settlement. Solutions Architects must design APIs, webhook systems, and reconciliation flows handling both modes seamlessly through the Circle/USDC platform.

2. **HKEX: 2238 Public Status**: LianLian's listing provides RSU liquidity that matters for client-facing roles where retention is critical. Long-tenured SAs build deep merchant relationships that generate recurring revenue.

3. **Digital Asset Advisory Premium**: SAs who can advise merchants on stablecoin settlement — explaining benefits (instant settlement, reduced FX spread), risks, and integration requirements — bring a rare Digital Asset advisory capability that directly accelerates merchant adoption and the 26.8% revenue growth.

4. **Revenue Multiplier Role**: Every merchant successfully onboarded to the stablecoin settlement platform represents millions in annual transaction volume. SA expertise directly translates to LianLian's top line.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Revenue-Linked Solution Design**
> "As a Solutions Architect, I directly influence merchant adoption of LianLian's Circle/USDC Stablecoin-Powered Settlement platform. Each enterprise merchant I onboard represents millions in annual volume supporting the 26.8% revenue growth. My compensation should include a variable component tied to merchant onboarding and Digital Asset settlement volume milestones."

**Lever 2: Dual-Mode Settlement Expertise**
> "Designing integration architectures supporting both traditional bank settlement and USDC stablecoin settlement is a new Digital Asset challenge with no playbook. I bring experience designing multi-protocol payment integrations. This justifies a 15-20% premium over standard SA offers."

**Lever 3: Merchant Advisory Premium**
> "My role includes advising merchants on stablecoin settlement — benefits, regulatory implications, and Circle/USDC integration requirements. This Digital Asset advisory capability accelerates merchant adoption. I am asking for compensation reflecting both technical and commercial value."

**Lever 4: Cross-Border Regulatory Knowledge**
> "Designing merchant integration solutions across PRC, Hong Kong, and Singapore for the Stablecoin-Powered Settlement platform requires deep understanding of each jurisdiction's Digital Asset regulations. I am looking for a 10-15% premium acknowledging this cross-border regulatory expertise."
