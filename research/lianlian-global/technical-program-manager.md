#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| :cn: Hangzhou (CNY) | ¥400,000 – ¥700,000 | ¥180,000 – ¥450,000 | ¥580,000 – ¥1,150,000 |
| :hong_kong: Hong Kong (HKD) | HK$650,000 – HK$1,100,000 | HK$250,000 – HK$550,000 | HK$900,000 – HK$1,650,000 |
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$110,000 – S$180,000 | S$40,000 – S$100,000 | S$150,000 – S$280,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Technical Program Managers at LianLian Global (HKEX: 2238) orchestrate the most complex, cross-functional initiatives across the company. The Circle/USDC integration is exactly the kind of program that defines a TPM's career — a multi-quarter, cross-team, multi-jurisdiction initiative coordinating engineering, product, compliance, legal, finance, and external partners (Circle) to deliver the Stablecoin-Powered Settlement platform. The 26.8% revenue growth creates execution urgency, and TPMs who have managed similarly complex Digital Asset programs carry enormous negotiation leverage because the Circle integration cannot succeed without disciplined program execution.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| LianLian Level | Equivalent Title | Airwallex Equiv. | PingPong Equiv. | WorldFirst Equiv. |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| P6-P7 | Technical Program Manager | TPM IC3-IC4 | Project Manager | L4-L5 PM |
| P8 | Senior TPM / Program Director | Senior TPM IC5 | Senior PM | L6 PM |

TPM as a formal function is less established in Chinese tech companies. At LianLian, TPM roles may be titled "Project Manager" internally, but the scope aligns with Silicon Valley TPM standards. This creates a negotiation opportunity — benchmark against US tech company TPM compensation (adjusted for local market) rather than Chinese "Project Manager" benchmarks.

Against competitors:
- **Airwallex**: Has a formal TPM function; compensation is competitive in Hong Kong but pre-IPO equity carries risk.
- **PingPong**: No dedicated TPM function; program management handled by engineering managers.
- **WorldFirst**: Ant Group has a mature PMO function with competitive compensation, but equity remains uncertain.

#### :coin: LianLian Circle/USDC & Digital Asset Lever

LianLian Global's Memorandum of Understanding with **Circle** to integrate USDC **stablecoin** settlement represents the single largest program initiative at LianLian. The **Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot** and **26.8% revenue growth** create urgency for a TPM who can drive the **Digital Asset** integration to completion on time and within scope.

**Why this matters for Technical Program Managers:**

1. **Program Complexity**: The Circle/USDC integration spans engineering, product, legal, finance, and external partnerships. A TPM managing this level of cross-functional complexity on the Digital Asset stablecoin platform is indispensable.

2. **HKEX: 2238 Public Status**: LianLian's listing means TPMs receive RSU grants vesting into publicly traded shares. Replacing a TPM mid-program is extremely disruptive — retention-focused compensation is justified.

3. **Digital Asset Premium**: TPMs who have managed programs at the intersection of traditional finance and stablecoin/blockchain are rare. The Circle MOU requires a TPM who understands both regulatory program management and Digital Asset technical integration.

4. **External Partnership Coordination**: The MOU with Circle requires ongoing coordination with Circle's teams — joint milestones, SLAs, and escalation paths. TPMs with complex partner integration experience bring direct value to the 26.8% revenue growth execution.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Program Risk Mitigation**
> "The Circle/USDC integration is LianLian's highest-priority Stablecoin-Powered Settlement program. Each quarter of delay represents millions in foregone revenue against the 26.8% growth trajectory. My track record delivering complex Digital Asset programs on time justifies upper-band compensation."

**Lever 2: Cross-Functional Orchestration Complexity**
> "This program spans engineering, product, compliance, legal, finance, and external Circle partnership. Managing this level of cross-functional complexity on a Digital Asset stablecoin platform requires deep payments industry experience. I am targeting senior TPM benchmarks."

**Lever 3: TPM Function Benchmark Reset**
> "The scope of this role aligns with Silicon Valley TPM standards — managing cross-team Digital Asset programs with P&L impact. I would like compensation benchmarked against global TPM standards, not local project manager benchmarks. Based on market data for stablecoin infrastructure programs, that means a total comp of [X]."

**Lever 4: External Partner Management Premium**
> "The Circle partnership requires ongoing external coordination — joint milestones, SLA management, and escalation handling for the stablecoin settlement platform. I am requesting a 10-15% premium over internal-only TPM benchmarks."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Hangzhou-based TPM roles, start your ask at ¥1,050,000 total comp (¥630,000 base + ¥420,000 RSU/4yr), and accept no lower than ¥650,000 total comp. For Hong Kong roles, start at HK$1,550,000 total comp (base HK$1,050,000 + RSU HK$500,000), accept no lower than HK$980,000. For Singapore, start at S$265,000 total comp, accept no lower than S$170,000. Push for a program completion bonus tied to Circle/USDC integration milestones (target 15-20% of base), and negotiate RSU grants at 50-65% of base over four years.
