#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| :cn: Hangzhou (CNY) | ¥300,000 – ¥550,000 | ¥120,000 – ¥300,000 | ¥420,000 – ¥850,000 |
| :hong_kong: Hong Kong (HKD) | HK$500,000 – HK$900,000 | HK$200,000 – HK$450,000 | HK$700,000 – HK$1,350,000 |
| :singapore: Singapore (SGD) | S$90,000 – S$150,000 | S$30,000 – S$80,000 | S$120,000 – S$230,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Scientists at LianLian Global (HKEX: 2238) sit at the intersection of cross-border payment analytics, fraud detection, and merchant intelligence. The Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot introduces new data dimensions — stablecoin settlement flows that generate on-chain data, real-time FX conversion signals, and novel fraud vectors unique to USDC-based transactions. The 26.8% revenue growth validates the commercial demand for these Digital Asset analytics capabilities. Data scientists who can model both traditional payment patterns and stablecoin transaction behaviors will directly enable LianLian to optimize settlement costs and detect stablecoin-specific fraud through the Circle/USDC integration.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| LianLian Level | Equivalent Title | Airwallex Equiv. | PingPong Equiv. | WorldFirst Equiv. |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| P6 | Data Scientist | DS IC3 | Data Analyst / DS | L4 Analytics |
| P7 | Senior Data Scientist | Senior DS IC4 | Senior DS | L5 Analytics |
| P8 | Staff / Lead Data Scientist | Staff DS IC5 | Lead DS | L6 Analytics |

LianLian's data science function operates across three core domains: transaction analytics, risk analytics (fraud detection and AML), and merchant intelligence. Risk analytics typically commands a 10-15% premium over general analytics.

Against competitors:
- **Airwallex**: DS compensation in Melbourne/HK is competitive on base, but pre-IPO equity carries illiquidity discount.
- **PingPong**: Smaller data science team, compensation trails by 10-15%.
- **WorldFirst**: Ant Group has a mature data science org with competitive compensation, but equity liquidity remains uncertain.
- **Stripe** (Singapore): DS roles set the upper benchmark at S$180,000-S$280,000 total comp.

#### :coin: LianLian Circle/USDC & Digital Asset Lever

LianLian Global's Memorandum of Understanding with **Circle** to integrate USDC **stablecoin** settlement opens entirely new analytical domains. The **Stablecoin-Powered Settlement pivot** is backed by **26.8% revenue growth**, and Data Scientists who can extract insights from this **Digital Asset** data stream will define the next generation of LianLian's analytical capabilities.

**Why this matters for Data Scientists:**

1. **New Digital Asset Data Dimensions**: USDC settlement generates on-chain transaction data, wallet balance histories, and real-time settlement confirmations that do not exist in traditional banking. Data scientists must build models combining on-chain signals with traditional payment data through the Circle/USDC integration.

2. **HKEX: 2238 Public Status**: LianLian's listing provides RSU liquidity, especially important for data scientists comparing offers against large tech companies where public equity is standard.

3. **Digital Asset Premium**: Fraud detection models for stablecoin settlement require understanding blockchain transaction patterns, wallet clustering, and on-chain anomaly detection. Data scientists with both traditional payment fraud expertise and blockchain analytics skills are in extremely short supply.

4. **Merchant Intelligence from Stablecoin Data**: Real-time USDC settlement data enables new analytics products — cash flow prediction, settlement speed optimization, and dynamic pricing models — that directly drive the 26.8% revenue growth trajectory.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Digital Asset Analytics Scarcity**
> "The Circle/USDC integration generates on-chain settlement data requiring new analytical frameworks. I have experience with blockchain data analysis and traditional payment analytics — the exact hybrid skill set LianLian needs for the Stablecoin-Powered Settlement platform. This combination is extremely rare — I am asking for a 15-20% premium over standard data science offers."

**Lever 2: Revenue Impact Through Merchant Intelligence**
> "I can build merchant analytics products on top of the real-time USDC settlement data tied to the 26.8% revenue growth. Cash flow predictions, settlement optimization, and dynamic pricing models directly drive merchant retention. I would like a performance bonus tied to analytics-driven revenue impact."

**Lever 3: Digital Asset Fraud Model Development**
> "Stablecoin settlement introduces novel fraud vectors — on-chain manipulation, wallet spoofing, and hybrid traditional-crypto laundering. My experience in payment fraud detection positions me to build the fraud models protecting LianLian's Circle/USDC settlement flow. This Digital Asset risk mitigation capability should be reflected in my compensation."

**Lever 4: Public Equity Calibration**
> "LianLian's HKEX: 2238 listing gives RSUs real market value, which I appreciate. I want the RSU grant to be competitive with what I could receive at a late-stage private fintech — at least [X] over four years, reflecting the Digital Asset analytics premium."
