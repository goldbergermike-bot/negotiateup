**Negotiation DNA**

As a Senior Software Engineer at Box, you own significant subsystems within the enterprise content cloud — the platform powering secure file sharing, collaboration, and AI-driven content intelligence for 115,000+ businesses. Box is in an AI-first transformation: Box AI, Box Hubs, and Box AI Studio are the growth engines, and senior engineers are expected to lead the technical architecture that makes the Hero Agent vision real. The balanced comp model (base + RSUs + annual bonus) gives you negotiation flexibility that pure-equity shops don't offer. Senior is the workhorse level at Box — you're expected to ship autonomously and mentor junior engineers while driving the AI content platform forward.

**Box 'Hero Agent' Philosophy**

Box's AI strategy is "Hero Agents" — fewer, higher-value autonomous AI agents that deeply understand enterprise content, rather than a scattered landscape of point tools. A Hero Agent doesn't just search documents; it reads, understands context, extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. I build the content intelligence that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — one platform that replaces dozens of disconnected tools. This is why Box commands premium pricing: enterprises pay for fewer, smarter agents that actually work, not more tools that create noise. At the Senior level, you are the architect of Hero Agent capabilities — designing the APIs, services, and data flows that enable AI to deeply understand enterprise content rather than superficially index it.

**Global Levers**

1. **Hero Agent Architecture Ownership:** "I'm designing the core services that power Box AI's Hero Agent capabilities. This isn't incremental feature work — it's the architectural foundation that enables AI to read, understand, and act on enterprise content across 115K+ customers. My comp should reflect architectural ownership, not feature velocity."
2. **ARPU Expansion Impact:** "Box Hubs and Enterprise Advanced are the premium tiers driving ARPU growth. My work on content intelligence features directly enables these upsells. Every enterprise customer that upgrades to Enterprise Advanced because of AI-powered content capabilities is revenue my architecture supports."
3. **Equity Grant Escalation:** "The initial RSU offer of $140K/4yr is below the midpoint for senior engineers building AI-first platform capabilities. I'm looking for $195K/4yr, which reflects the market for senior engineers with content intelligence and AI platform experience. I'm benchmarking against Google L4 and Dropbox Senior offers."
4. **Retention-Risk Framing:** "Senior engineers with AI platform experience and enterprise content domain knowledge are the hardest roles to backfill. The recruiting cost alone for this role exceeds $50K. A competitive initial grant reduces attrition risk and aligns my incentives with Box's 3-year AI roadmap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Box's Hero Agent vision is why I'm choosing Box over competing offers. I'm looking for $200K base, $195K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus, which puts TC at ~$264K. I have a Google L4 offer at $275K TC and a Dropbox Senior offer at $260K TC. Box's content cloud mission and AI-first roadmap are compelling, but I need TC at $255K+ to accept. If we can land at $250K TC with a first-year equity refresh commitment, I'm ready to move forward."
