### Software Engineer | Box Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + Equity + Bonus | Intelligent Content Cloud | AI-First Content Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $148K–$185K | $95K–$165K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | $172K–$232K |
| New York | $152K–$194K | $95K–$165K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | $177K–$243K |
| London | £108K–£135K | £70K–£120K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | £126K–£170K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Box is the enterprise content cloud serving 115,000+ businesses globally — secure file sharing, collaboration, workflow automation, and now AI-powered content intelligence. As a Software Engineer at Box, you're building the platform infrastructure that stores, secures, and delivers mission-critical enterprise content. Box's AI-first content management strategy means every engineer contributes to a platform where intelligent agents read, summarize, and act on documents at scale. The balanced comp structure (base + RSUs + bonus) gives you three distinct levers to negotiate, unlike equity-only shops.

**Level Mapping:** Box SWE = Google L3–L4 = Dropbox SWE = Microsoft SDE I–II = Atlassian P3

**Box 'Hero Agent' Philosophy**

Box's AI strategy is "Hero Agents" — fewer, higher-value autonomous AI agents that deeply understand enterprise content, rather than a scattered landscape of point tools. A Hero Agent doesn't just search documents; it reads, understands context, extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. I build the content intelligence that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — one platform that replaces dozens of disconnected tools. This is why Box commands premium pricing: enterprises pay for fewer, smarter agents that actually work, not more tools that create noise. As a Software Engineer, every service, API, and feature you ship strengthens the Hero Agent's ability to understand and act on enterprise content — your platform code is the foundation the AI runs on.

**Global Levers**

1. **Content Cloud TAM Expansion:** "Box isn't competing for file storage anymore — it's the intelligent content cloud. Box Hubs, Box AI Studio, and Enterprise Advanced are expanding ARPU across 115K+ customers. My engineering work directly supports the platform these premium tiers run on — comp should reflect platform-tier impact, not legacy file-sync benchmarks."
2. **AI-First Platform Anchor:** "Every feature I build feeds into Box AI's Hero Agent capabilities. I'm not writing CRUD endpoints — I'm building the content infrastructure that AI agents depend on to read, summarize, and automate enterprise documents. That positions me at the AI premium end of SWE comp."
3. **Balanced Comp Triple Lever:** "I'd like to optimize across all three comp levers. Specifically, I'm looking for base at $178K, RSU grant at $150K/4yr, and bonus target at 15%. Box's balanced structure means we can find alignment without maxing any single component."
4. **Competing Cloud Offers:** "I have competing offers from Dropbox and Atlassian. Box's content cloud leadership and AI roadmap are why I prefer Box — but I need the total comp to be competitive. My Dropbox offer is at $225K TC, and I'd like Box to match or exceed that given the Hero Agent platform opportunity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Box's intelligent content cloud is the platform I want to build on — the Hero Agent vision is the most compelling AI strategy in the content management space. I'm looking for $180K base, $155K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus target, which puts TC at ~$224K. I have a Dropbox offer at $228K TC and an Atlassian offer at $220K TC. I'd like Box to come in at $220K+ TC to reflect the AI-first platform opportunity. If we can land at $215K+ TC with a strong first-year refresh commitment, I'm ready to sign."
