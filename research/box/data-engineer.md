### Data Engineer | Box Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + Equity + Bonus | Intelligent Content Cloud | AI-First Content Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $152K–$192K | $102K–$175K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | $178K–$238K |
| New York | $157K–$202K | $102K–$175K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | $184K–$250K |
| London | £111K–£140K | £75K–£128K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | £130K–£174K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Box build the content metadata pipelines and document analytics infrastructure that power the intelligent content cloud for 115,000+ businesses. This is not generic ETL work — Box's data engineering challenge is uniquely complex: you're processing metadata, content signals, collaboration events, and document lifecycle data at massive scale to feed both business analytics and Box AI's Hero Agent capabilities. Every document uploaded, shared, edited, and summarized generates data that your pipelines must ingest, transform, and serve. Box Hubs, Box AI Studio, and Enterprise Advanced all depend on data engineering infrastructure to deliver content intelligence. The balanced comp structure gives you three levers, with data engineering at Box commanding a premium due to the content metadata domain expertise required.

**Box 'Hero Agent' Philosophy**

Box's AI strategy is "Hero Agents" — fewer, higher-value autonomous AI agents that deeply understand enterprise content, rather than a scattered landscape of point tools. A Hero Agent doesn't just search documents; it reads, understands context, extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. I build the content intelligence that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — one platform that replaces dozens of disconnected tools. This is why Box commands premium pricing: enterprises pay for fewer, smarter agents that actually work, not more tools that create noise. As a Data Engineer, you build the data backbone that the Hero Agent depends on — the metadata pipelines, content graphs, document analytics, and feature stores that enable AI to deeply understand enterprise content rather than superficially process it.

**Global Levers**

1. **Content Metadata Pipeline Complexity:** "Box's content metadata pipelines process billions of document events daily — uploads, shares, edits, AI summarizations, collaboration signals, and access patterns across 115K+ businesses. I build the infrastructure that turns this raw data into the content intelligence layer that Box AI and Box Hubs depend on. This pipeline complexity is well beyond standard analytics ETL."
2. **AI Training Data Infrastructure:** "Box AI's Hero Agent capabilities depend on training data infrastructure that I build and maintain. The quality of document understanding, summarization, and workflow automation is directly tied to the quality of the training data pipelines. I'm not just building analytics — I'm building the data foundation for Box's AI strategy."
3. **Document Analytics for ARPU Expansion:** "My data pipelines power the content analytics that inform pricing and packaging decisions for Enterprise Advanced and Box Hubs. The insights generated by my infrastructure directly influence which features drive enterprise upsells — this is data engineering with direct revenue impact."
4. **Compliance-Aware Data Architecture:** "Data engineering at Box requires compliance awareness — data residency, content retention policies, GDPR, and industry-specific regulations affect how I architect every pipeline. This compliance dimension adds significant complexity that standard data engineering roles don't have."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Box's content metadata challenge — processing billions of document events to power both analytics and AI — is the most interesting data engineering problem I've seen. I'm looking for $185K base, $158K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus target, putting TC at ~$232K. I have competing offers from Snowflake ($242K TC) and Databricks ($238K TC). Box's unique content data domain and Hero Agent data infrastructure opportunity are compelling — I need TC at $225K+ to accept. If the RSU grant lands at $148K+ and bonus target confirms at 15%, I'm ready to commit."
