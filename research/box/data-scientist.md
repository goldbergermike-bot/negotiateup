### Data Scientist | Box Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + Equity + Bonus | Intelligent Content Cloud | AI-First Content Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $158K–$198K | $108K–$185K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | $188K–$255K |
| New York | $163K–$208K | $108K–$185K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | $194K–$267K |
| London | £115K–£145K | £79K–£135K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | £138K–£186K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Box analyze the content analytics, document intelligence, and usage patterns of the enterprise content cloud serving 115,000+ businesses. You're not analyzing generic web metrics — you're mining insights from how enterprises create, share, collaborate on, and consume content at scale. Box AI's Hero Agent capabilities depend on data science: understanding document structures, content consumption patterns, collaboration graphs, and workflow efficiency. Your models determine which AI features get built, how the Hero Agent prioritizes content summarization, and where Box Hubs delivers the most value. The balanced comp structure gives you three levers, with data science at Box commanding a premium due to the unique content intelligence domain.

**Box 'Hero Agent' Philosophy**

Box's AI strategy is "Hero Agents" — fewer, higher-value autonomous AI agents that deeply understand enterprise content, rather than a scattered landscape of point tools. A Hero Agent doesn't just search documents; it reads, understands context, extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. I build the content intelligence that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — one platform that replaces dozens of disconnected tools. This is why Box commands premium pricing: enterprises pay for fewer, smarter agents that actually work, not more tools that create noise. As a Data Scientist, you are the intelligence layer behind the Hero Agent — your models determine how it understands content patterns, which documents to prioritize, how to rank summaries, and where automation delivers the highest value for enterprise users.

**Global Levers**

1. **Content Intelligence Uniqueness:** "Box has the most valuable enterprise content dataset in the world — billions of documents, collaboration patterns, and workflow signals across 115K+ businesses. I'm the data scientist who turns that dataset into the intelligence that powers Box AI. This isn't generic clickstream analytics — it's enterprise content intelligence that directly drives the Hero Agent's capabilities."
2. **AI Feature Prioritization Impact:** "My analysis determines which AI features Box builds next. When I identify that 40% of enterprise users spend 3+ hours weekly summarizing documents manually, that insight directly drives the Box AI summarization feature roadmap. My models are the evidence base for multi-million-dollar product investments."
3. **Usage Pattern Monetization:** "Content usage analytics directly inform Box's pricing and packaging strategy. My analysis of feature adoption, engagement depth, and workflow complexity determines which capabilities go into Enterprise Advanced vs. Business tier. This pricing intelligence has direct revenue impact."
4. **Document Understanding Domain:** "Enterprise document intelligence is a specialized domain — understanding document structure, metadata relationships, content graphs, and collaboration workflows requires domain expertise beyond generic data science. I bring this content-specific analytical depth, which is exceptionally hard to recruit."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Box's content intelligence opportunity is unmatched — no other company has this depth of enterprise document data. I'm looking for $190K base, $168K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus target, putting TC at ~$247K. I have offers from Google ($260K TC) and Dropbox ($242K TC) for data science roles. Box's content analytics domain and Hero Agent data science opportunity are uniquely compelling — I need TC at $240K+ to accept. If the RSU grant lands at $160K+ with a strong refresh path, I'm ready to sign."
