**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Box build the AI engine that powers the Hero Agent — the document understanding models, content summarization systems, and workflow automation intelligence that differentiate Box from every other content management platform. This is not generic ML work — you're training models on enterprise documents at a scale and diversity no other company can match. Box AI processes contracts, financial reports, medical records, legal briefs, engineering specs, and marketing assets — your models must understand all of these document types with enterprise-grade accuracy. Box serves 115,000+ businesses, and your ML models are the core value proposition that justifies premium Enterprise Advanced pricing. The Agentic AI Premium (15–25%) reflects the market reality that engineers building autonomous AI agents command significantly above-market comp.

**Box 'Hero Agent' Philosophy**

Box's AI strategy is "Hero Agents" — fewer, higher-value autonomous AI agents that deeply understand enterprise content, rather than a scattered landscape of point tools. A Hero Agent doesn't just search documents; it reads, understands context, extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. I build the content intelligence that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — one platform that replaces dozens of disconnected tools. This is why Box commands premium pricing: enterprises pay for fewer, smarter agents that actually work, not more tools that create noise. As an ML/AI Engineer, you are the brain of the Hero Agent — your models determine how deeply the AI understands documents, how accurately it summarizes content, and how reliably it automates workflows. The Hero Agent is only as intelligent as the ML models you build.

**Global Levers**

1. **Agentic AI Premium (15–25%):** "I'm building autonomous AI agents that read, understand, and act on enterprise content — this is the definition of agentic AI engineering. The market premium for engineers building production-grade autonomous agents is 15–25% above standard ML comp. My ask reflects this premium: I'm not training classification models — I'm building an AI agent that replaces entire categories of knowledge work."
2. **Enterprise Document Understanding Moat:** "Box has the most diverse enterprise document corpus in the world — contracts, financials, medical records, legal documents, engineering specs. The document understanding models I build on this data create a moat no competitor can replicate. My models are the source of Box's AI competitive advantage, and my comp should reflect that strategic value."
3. **Hero Agent ML Architecture:** "The Hero Agent requires a unified ML architecture — not separate models for summarization, extraction, and automation. I'm building the integrated intelligence layer that enables one agent to deeply understand content across all document types and all enterprise use cases. This architectural unification is my core expertise."
4. **Foundation Model Integration:** "I integrate and fine-tune foundation models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) for enterprise document understanding within Box's security and compliance framework. This requires expertise in both ML engineering and enterprise security — prompt engineering, model evaluation, content safety, and data privacy at scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the AI engine that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — the document understanding, content summarization, and workflow automation intelligence that justifies Box's premium pricing. I'm looking for $210K base, $225K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus target, putting TC at ~$278K — with the full Agentic AI Premium applied. I have competing offers from Anthropic ($310K TC) and Google Brain ($295K TC). Box's enterprise document corpus and Hero Agent vision create a uniquely compelling ML challenge — but I need TC at $270K+ with the Agentic AI Premium explicitly reflected. If the RSU grant lands at $215K+ and we confirm the 15-25% premium is baked into the band, I'll commit to building the Hero Agent's brain."
