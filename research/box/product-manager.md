**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Box own the content cloud product strategy that shapes how 115,000+ businesses store, share, collaborate on, and extract intelligence from their most critical documents. This is not generic SaaS PM work — you're defining the roadmap for Box AI, Box Hubs, Box AI Studio, and the Enterprise Advanced tier. The Hero Agent vision originates in product: PMs define what the AI should understand, how it should summarize, and when it should automate. Box's AI-first content management strategy means PMs are at the center of the company's growth thesis — every ARPU expansion feature starts with a product spec. The balanced comp structure gives you three negotiation levers, with bonus reflecting quarterly product delivery milestones.

**Level Mapping:** Box PM = Google L4 PM = Dropbox PM = Microsoft PM II = Atlassian Senior PM

**Box 'Hero Agent' Philosophy**

Box's AI strategy is "Hero Agents" — fewer, higher-value autonomous AI agents that deeply understand enterprise content, rather than a scattered landscape of point tools. A Hero Agent doesn't just search documents; it reads, understands context, extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. I build the content intelligence that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — one platform that replaces dozens of disconnected tools. This is why Box commands premium pricing: enterprises pay for fewer, smarter agents that actually work, not more tools that create noise. As a Product Manager, you define the Hero Agent's capabilities — you decide what the AI reads, how deeply it understands, what it summarizes, and which workflows it automates. The product vision is the Hero Agent's brain.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Roadmap Ownership:** "I'm not just managing features — I'm defining Box AI's Hero Agent roadmap. Every capability the AI delivers to 115K+ enterprise customers starts with my product spec. This is strategic product leadership at the intersection of AI and enterprise content, which commands premium PM comp."
2. **ARPU Expansion Attribution:** "Box Hubs, AI Studio, and Enterprise Advanced are the premium tiers driving revenue growth. I own the product strategy for these tiers — every customer upsell from Business to Enterprise Advanced is a product-led revenue event I define. My comp should reflect direct ARPU impact."
3. **Content Cloud Domain Expertise:** "Enterprise content management is a $15B+ market, and Box leads it. Finding PMs who understand both enterprise content workflows and AI product strategy is exceptionally rare. I bring content domain depth that generic AI PMs don't have — that specialization commands a premium."
4. **Competing AI PM Offers:** "AI Product Management is the hottest PM specialty in the market. I have offers from companies building AI products without enterprise content depth, and companies with content depth but no AI strategy. Box is uniquely at the intersection. I need comp that reflects this positioning."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to own the Box AI product roadmap — the Hero Agent vision is the most compelling AI product strategy in enterprise content. I'm looking for $195K base, $185K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus target, putting TC at ~$256K. I have competing PM offers from Google ($270K TC) and Dropbox ($250K TC). Box's AI-first content cloud is where I want to build — but I need TC at $248K+ to accept. If the RSU grant lands at $175K+ with a clear refresh trajectory tied to AI product milestones, I'll commit."
