### DevOps Engineer | Box Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + Equity + Bonus | Intelligent Content Cloud | AI-First Content Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $158K–$198K | $108K–$185K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | $188K–$255K |
| New York | $163K–$208K | $108K–$185K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | $194K–$267K |
| London | £115K–£145K | £79K–£135K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | £138K–£186K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Box operate the content cloud infrastructure that 115,000+ businesses depend on for their most critical documents. This is not generic cloud ops — Box's infrastructure must meet FedRAMP, HIPAA, GxP, and SOC 2 compliance requirements while delivering sub-second content access across a global CDN. The AI-first transformation adds new infrastructure demands: Box AI's Hero Agent capabilities require GPU-optimized inference pipelines, real-time document processing infrastructure, and secure AI model serving — all within Box's enterprise-grade compliance framework. DevOps at Box is the intersection of content cloud scale, regulatory compliance, and AI infrastructure. The balanced comp structure rewards both operational excellence (base + bonus) and strategic infrastructure investment (equity).

**Level Mapping:** Box DevOps Engineer = Google L4 SRE = Dropbox Infrastructure Engineer = Microsoft SRE II

**Box 'Hero Agent' Philosophy**

Box's AI strategy is "Hero Agents" — fewer, higher-value autonomous AI agents that deeply understand enterprise content, rather than a scattered landscape of point tools. A Hero Agent doesn't just search documents; it reads, understands context, extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. I build the content intelligence that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — one platform that replaces dozens of disconnected tools. This is why Box commands premium pricing: enterprises pay for fewer, smarter agents that actually work, not more tools that create noise. As a DevOps Engineer, you build and operate the infrastructure the Hero Agent runs on — the compute, storage, networking, and compliance infrastructure that enables AI to process enterprise content at scale while maintaining the security posture that regulated industries require.

**Global Levers**

1. **FedRAMP/Compliance Infrastructure Premium:** "Box serves federal government agencies, healthcare providers, and life sciences companies — all requiring FedRAMP, HIPAA, and GxP compliance. I build and maintain the infrastructure that enables these certifications. Compliance infrastructure engineering is a specialized skill set that commands 10-15% above standard DevOps comp."
2. **AI Infrastructure Expansion:** "Box AI's Hero Agent capabilities require new infrastructure — GPU inference clusters, real-time document processing pipelines, and AI model serving at enterprise scale. I'm building the AI infrastructure layer while maintaining existing content cloud SLAs. This dual mandate — AI innovation plus operational stability — justifies above-midpoint comp."
3. **Global CDN & Availability:** "Box's content cloud requires 99.99% availability across global regions. I operate the CDN, caching layer, and multi-region infrastructure that delivers sub-second content access worldwide. Every minute of downtime costs Box enterprise customer trust and revenue. My operational excellence has direct revenue protection impact."
4. **Infrastructure Cost Optimization:** "I optimize Box's cloud infrastructure spend — every 1% efficiency improvement translates to millions in annual savings at Box's scale. My cost optimization work has direct margin impact that exceeds my total compensation multiple times over."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Box's content cloud infrastructure — FedRAMP-compliant, globally distributed, and now AI-capable — is the most interesting DevOps challenge I've seen. I'm looking for $190K base, $168K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus target, putting TC at ~$247K. I have competing offers from Google SRE ($258K TC) and AWS ($245K TC). Box's unique combination of compliance infrastructure, global content CDN, and AI infrastructure expansion is compelling — I need TC at $238K+ to accept. If the RSU grant lands at $155K+ and bonus target confirms at 15%, I'm ready to commit."
