*+15–25% Agentic AI Premium on top of standard engineering bands. This is Box's signature technical role for 2026.*

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Box's signature role — the Box AI Content Intelligence Engineer. You build the AI engine that reads, understands, summarizes, and acts on enterprise documents at scale for 115,000+ businesses. This role doesn't exist at any other company in this exact form: it combines deep document understanding, content summarization, workflow automation, Hero Agent architecture, and Box AI Studio platform engineering into a single engineering discipline. You're not building a chatbot that searches files — you're building an autonomous content intelligence system that deeply understands contracts, financial reports, medical records, legal briefs, and engineering specifications, then extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. The Hero Agent philosophy is your mandate: fewer, smarter AI agents that actually replace dozens of disconnected tools. Box AI Content Intelligence is Box's #1 product investment, and engineers in this role are the highest-priority hires in the company.

**Level Mapping:** Box AI Content Intelligence Engineer (Senior) = Google L4–L5 AI Platform = Anthropic Senior Platform Engineer = OpenAI Applied AI Engineer

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Box AI Content Intelligence Engineer builds systems that are fundamentally different from standard AI/ML engineering:
- **Deep Document Understanding:** Training and deploying models that understand document structure, context, semantics, and relationships across every enterprise document type — not just keyword search, but true comprehension
- **Content Summarization at Enterprise Scale:** Building summarization systems that condense 100-page contracts, quarterly financial reports, and technical specifications into accurate, actionable summaries while preserving critical detail
- **Workflow Automation Intelligence:** Designing the decision engine that determines when and how AI should automate content workflows — routing documents, extracting key terms, triggering approvals, and generating responses
- **Hero Agent Architecture:** Architecting the unified AI agent that replaces dozens of point tools — one agent that reads, understands, summarizes, extracts, automates, and secures enterprise content
- **Box AI Studio Platform:** Building the platform that lets enterprise customers customize and extend Box AI's intelligence for their specific content domains and workflows

**Box 'Hero Agent' Philosophy**

Box's AI strategy is "Hero Agents" — fewer, higher-value autonomous AI agents that deeply understand enterprise content, rather than a scattered landscape of point tools. A Hero Agent doesn't just search documents; it reads, understands context, extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. I build the content intelligence that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — one platform that replaces dozens of disconnected tools. This is why Box commands premium pricing: enterprises pay for fewer, smarter agents that actually work, not more tools that create noise. As the Box AI Content Intelligence Engineer, you are the Hero Agent — this is your role's entire purpose. You architect, build, train, and deploy the AI system that embodies the Hero Agent philosophy. Every capability the Hero Agent has — document understanding, summarization, extraction, automation, security — passes through your code. You don't support the Hero Agent; you are the Hero Agent's creator.

**Global Levers**

1. **Signature Role — No Market Benchmark:** "This role doesn't exist at any other company — there's no direct comp benchmark for 'Box AI Content Intelligence Engineer.' I'm building a unified content intelligence system that combines document understanding, summarization, workflow automation, and enterprise security into a single AI agent. That means Box can't low-ball me by pointing to market data for generic ML engineers. I'm defining the market rate for this role."
2. **Agentic AI Premium (15–25%):** "I'm building the purest expression of an autonomous AI agent in the enterprise content space. The Hero Agent I build doesn't just assist — it reads, understands, summarizes, extracts, and automates across billions of enterprise documents. This is the definition of agentic AI engineering, and the full 25% premium applies."
3. **Revenue Engine Attribution:** "Box AI Content Intelligence directly drives Enterprise Advanced and Box AI Studio revenue. Every enterprise customer that upgrades for AI-powered content capabilities is revenue my code generates. At 115K+ businesses with potential for AI-tier upsells, the revenue my work enables is measured in hundreds of millions. My equity should reflect this direct revenue attribution."
4. **Enterprise Document Corpus Advantage:** "No other company has Box's depth and diversity of enterprise documents — billions of contracts, financial reports, medical records, legal briefs, and engineering specs across 115K+ businesses. The content intelligence models I build on this corpus create a moat that is impossible to replicate. I'm not just building AI — I'm building the defensible AI advantage that defines Box's future."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the core AI engine that makes Box a Hero Agent platform — the content intelligence that reads, understands, summarizes, and acts on enterprise documents at a scale no other company can match. This is Box's signature role and my #1 choice. I'm looking for $220K base, $255K RSU/4yr, and 20% bonus target, putting TC at ~$302K — with the full Agentic AI Premium applied. I have competing offers from Anthropic ($325K TC) and Google AI ($310K TC). Box's enterprise document corpus and Hero Agent vision create the most compelling content intelligence challenge in the industry — but I need TC at $295K+ with the Agentic AI Premium explicitly reflected. If the RSU grant lands at $245K+, bonus target at 20%, and we agree on a guaranteed first-year refresh commitment reflecting this role's strategic importance, I'll commit to building the Hero Agent. I want this specific role — no other company has this intersection of enterprise content scale, AI autonomy, and real-world document understanding."
