### Security Engineer | Box Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + Equity + Bonus | Intelligent Content Cloud | AI-First Content Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $168K–$208K | $125K–$215K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | $202K–$272K |
| New York | $173K–$218K | $125K–$215K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | $208K–$285K |
| London | £122K–£152K | £92K–£157K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | £148K–£199K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Box protect the enterprise content cloud that stores the most sensitive documents for 115,000+ businesses — including financial services, healthcare, government, and life sciences organizations. This is not generic application security — Box's security mandate spans content encryption, data loss prevention (DLP), FedRAMP authorization, HIPAA compliance, GxP validation, and SOC 2 attestation. The AI-first transformation adds a new critical dimension: securing AI agents that read, understand, and act on enterprise content. How do you ensure a Hero Agent doesn't leak sensitive content, violate data residency requirements, or bypass access controls? This is the frontier of AI content security, and Box Security Engineers are defining it. The balanced comp structure with premium bands (matching Senior SWE) reflects the specialized criticality of this role.

**Level Mapping:** Box Security Engineer = Google L4 Security Engineer = Microsoft Senior Security Engineer = Dropbox Security Engineer

**Box 'Hero Agent' Philosophy**

Box's AI strategy is "Hero Agents" — fewer, higher-value autonomous AI agents that deeply understand enterprise content, rather than a scattered landscape of point tools. A Hero Agent doesn't just search documents; it reads, understands context, extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. I build the content intelligence that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — one platform that replaces dozens of disconnected tools. This is why Box commands premium pricing: enterprises pay for fewer, smarter agents that actually work, not more tools that create noise. As a Security Engineer, you are the trust foundation of the Hero Agent — you ensure that as AI reads and acts on the most sensitive enterprise content, it does so with enterprise-grade encryption, access control, DLP, and compliance. Without security, there is no Hero Agent — there is only enterprise liability.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Content Security Pioneer:** "Securing AI agents that read and act on enterprise content is a new frontier. I'm defining the security model for how Box AI's Hero Agent accesses, processes, and generates content while maintaining encryption, access control, and data residency compliance. This AI security specialization doesn't have established market benchmarks — it commands a pioneer premium."
2. **Compliance Revenue Enablement:** "Box's FedRAMP, HIPAA, and GxP certifications are direct revenue enablers — they unlock entire customer segments (federal government, healthcare, pharma) that competitors can't reach. I maintain and expand these certifications. Every compliance milestone I deliver opens a new revenue stream worth millions in ACV."
3. **DLP and Content Protection Depth:** "Enterprise content DLP at Box's scale — billions of documents across 115K+ businesses — is an extraordinarily specialized domain. I build the classification, detection, and prevention systems that protect customer content from exfiltration, unauthorized access, and compliance violations. This scale of content protection expertise is rare."
4. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Enterprise content security engineers with both compliance depth (FedRAMP, HIPAA, GxP) and AI security expertise are among the hardest roles to recruit. The market premium for this combination is 15-20% above standard security engineering comp. My ask reflects this talent scarcity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Box's content security challenge — protecting the most sensitive enterprise documents while enabling AI agents to read and act on them — is the most compelling security engineering problem I've seen. I'm looking for $202K base, $195K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus target, putting TC at ~$269K. I have competing offers from Google Security ($278K TC) and CrowdStrike ($262K TC). Box's unique intersection of content security, compliance, and AI trust is differentiated — I need TC at $258K+ to accept. If the RSU grant lands at $185K+ and we agree on clear refresh path tied to compliance milestones, I'm ready to sign."
