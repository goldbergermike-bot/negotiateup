### Engineering Manager | Box Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + Equity + Bonus | Intelligent Content Cloud | AI-First Content Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $182K–$225K | $155K–$262K RSU/4yr | 15–20% | $225K–$305K |
| New York | $187K–$236K | $155K–$262K RSU/4yr | 15–20% | $232K–$320K |
| London | £133K–£164K | £113K–£191K RSU/4yr | 15–20% | £164K–£223K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Box lead teams building the intelligent content cloud that serves 115,000+ businesses. Box's AI transformation — Box AI, Box Hubs, Box AI Studio, Enterprise Advanced — means EMs are managing through a fundamental platform shift. You're not just shipping incremental features; you're leading teams through an AI-first content management transformation. The EM role at Box carries both people leadership and technical accountability: you're expected to understand the Hero Agent architecture deeply enough to make sound technical tradeoffs while building high-performing engineering teams. The balanced comp model (base + RSUs + 15–20% bonus) rewards both execution consistency (base + bonus) and long-term strategic impact (equity).

**Box 'Hero Agent' Philosophy**

Box's AI strategy is "Hero Agents" — fewer, higher-value autonomous AI agents that deeply understand enterprise content, rather than a scattered landscape of point tools. A Hero Agent doesn't just search documents; it reads, understands context, extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. I build the content intelligence that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — one platform that replaces dozens of disconnected tools. This is why Box commands premium pricing: enterprises pay for fewer, smarter agents that actually work, not more tools that create noise. As an Engineering Manager, you are the organizational architect of the Hero Agent vision — you build, develop, and retain the teams that make this AI-first transformation real. Your leadership directly determines whether Box ships a true Hero Agent or just another feature-fragmented AI product.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Transformation Leadership:** "I'm managing teams through Box's most important platform shift — the move to AI-first content management. This isn't steady-state management; it's transformation leadership. I'm retooling teams, establishing new technical competencies in ML/AI, and ensuring the Hero Agent vision translates into shipped product. Transformation leadership commands premium comp."
2. **Team Retention Economics:** "Engineering attrition costs Box $150K+ per departing senior engineer (recruiting, ramp-up, lost productivity). I manage a team of 8-12 engineers — my retention effectiveness directly impacts Box's bottom line by hundreds of thousands per year. My comp should reflect this P&L impact."
3. **Equity Grant for Strategic Continuity:** "Box's AI roadmap is a 3-year bet. You need managers who stay through the full transformation arc. A strong initial RSU grant ($240K/4yr) aligns my incentives with the company's strategic timeline and reduces the risk of leadership turnover during the most critical product cycle."
4. **Bonus Target at 20%:** "At the EM level, bonus should reflect team-level outcomes, not individual contribution. I'm asking for 20% target because my impact is measured in team velocity, AI feature delivery, and engineer retention — all of which compound across the org."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I've led AI platform transformations before, and Box's Hero Agent vision is the opportunity I want to lead. I'm looking for $218K base, $245K RSU/4yr, and 20% bonus target, putting TC at ~$297K. I have competing EM offers from Google ($310K TC) and Atlassian ($285K TC). Box's content cloud leadership and AI roadmap are differentiated — but I need TC at $290K+ to accept. If we can land the RSU grant at $235K+ with a confirmed refresh path, I'm committed to the full transformation arc."
