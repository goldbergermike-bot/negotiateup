### Product Designer | Box Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + Equity + Bonus | Intelligent Content Cloud | AI-First Content Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Redwood City | $142K–$178K | $85K–$148K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | $165K–$222K |
| New York | $146K–$187K | $85K–$148K RSU/4yr | 10–15% | $170K–$233K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Box shape the user experience of the enterprise content cloud — the collaboration interfaces, document workflows, and now AI-powered content experiences that 115,000+ businesses rely on daily. Box's AI-first transformation creates a unique design challenge: how do you make an AI Hero Agent's capabilities intuitive, trustworthy, and seamlessly integrated into content collaboration workflows? This is not standard SaaS design — you're designing the interaction layer between enterprise users and autonomous AI agents that read, summarize, and act on their documents. Box AI, Box Hubs, and Box AI Studio all require novel UX paradigms for AI-human content collaboration. The balanced comp structure provides three levers, with design-specific negotiation strength tied to the premium UX required for AI content experiences.

**Level Mapping:** Box Product Designer = Google UX Designer L3–L4 = Dropbox Product Designer = Figma Designer

**Box 'Hero Agent' Philosophy**

Box's AI strategy is "Hero Agents" — fewer, higher-value autonomous AI agents that deeply understand enterprise content, rather than a scattered landscape of point tools. A Hero Agent doesn't just search documents; it reads, understands context, extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. I build the content intelligence that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — one platform that replaces dozens of disconnected tools. This is why Box commands premium pricing: enterprises pay for fewer, smarter agents that actually work, not more tools that create noise. As a Product Designer, you make the Hero Agent usable — you design the interfaces that let enterprise users trust, direct, and collaborate with AI agents acting on their most sensitive content. If the design isn't intuitive, the Hero Agent fails regardless of its intelligence.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI UX Specialization Premium:** "Designing for AI-human content collaboration is a nascent design discipline. I'm not creating static CRUD interfaces — I'm designing experiences where users interact with autonomous AI agents that read, summarize, and act on their documents. This AI UX specialization commands a premium over traditional enterprise design roles."
2. **Trust-by-Design for Enterprise AI:** "Enterprise customers will only adopt Box AI if they trust it. Trust is a design problem — transparency, explainability, control, and progressive disclosure of AI actions. I bring the trust-by-design expertise that turns AI capabilities into enterprise adoption. Without effective trust UX, Box AI is a demo, not a product."
3. **Content Collaboration UX Depth:** "Box's content collaboration UX is its competitive moat against Google Drive and Microsoft SharePoint. I have deep experience designing content collaboration workflows that feel effortless. Pairing that domain expertise with AI interaction design is a rare combination."
4. **Portfolio-Driven Equity Ask:** "My portfolio demonstrates measurable impact on user engagement and feature adoption. I've designed AI-powered experiences that increased user engagement by X%. I'm asking for RSUs at $135K/4yr to reflect the direct business impact of design work on enterprise AI adoption."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Box AI needs world-class design to succeed — the Hero Agent is only as good as the experience layer users interact with. I'm looking for $170K base, $135K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus target, putting TC at ~$213K. I have offers from Figma ($220K TC) and Dropbox ($208K TC) — both strong design-led companies. Box's AI content experience challenge is the most interesting design problem I've seen, but I need TC at $205K+ to accept. If the RSU grant lands at $128K+ and we agree on 15% bonus target, I'm ready to commit."
