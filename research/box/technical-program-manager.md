**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Box orchestrate cross-product coordination across Box's most strategic initiatives — Box Hubs, Box AI Studio, Enterprise Advanced, and the core content cloud platform. Box's AI-first transformation has created unprecedented cross-team complexity: the Hero Agent vision requires coordinating ML/AI teams, platform engineering, security, compliance, product, and design into a unified delivery cadence. TPMs at Box are the connective tissue that ensures these workstreams ship together. The balanced comp structure (base + RSUs + 10–15% bonus) gives you three negotiation levers, with the bonus tied to program delivery milestones and cross-team execution quality.

**Level Mapping:** Box TPM = Google L4 TPM = Microsoft Senior TPM = Meta TPM = Amazon Senior TPM

**Box 'Hero Agent' Philosophy**

Box's AI strategy is "Hero Agents" — fewer, higher-value autonomous AI agents that deeply understand enterprise content, rather than a scattered landscape of point tools. A Hero Agent doesn't just search documents; it reads, understands context, extracts insights, generates summaries, automates workflows, and maintains enterprise-grade security throughout. I build the content intelligence that makes Box AI a true Hero Agent — one platform that replaces dozens of disconnected tools. This is why Box commands premium pricing: enterprises pay for fewer, smarter agents that actually work, not more tools that create noise. As a Technical Program Manager, you are the orchestrator who ensures the Hero Agent vision ships as one unified product — not as disconnected AI features scattered across teams. You coordinate the ML, platform, security, and product workstreams into a coherent delivery plan that makes the Hero Agent real.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Product Orchestration Complexity:** "I'm coordinating delivery across Box Hubs, AI Studio, Enterprise Advanced, and core platform — four major product lines that must integrate seamlessly for the Hero Agent vision to work. This level of cross-product orchestration complexity is significantly above standard TPM scope and should be reflected in above-midpoint comp."
2. **AI Program Delivery Expertise:** "Shipping AI products requires different program management — non-deterministic model outputs, data pipeline dependencies, safety/trust reviews, and compliance validation. I bring AI-specific program management expertise that ensures Box AI ships on time without cutting corners on enterprise-grade quality."
3. **Stakeholder Span:** "I manage dependencies across 6+ engineering teams, product, design, security, compliance, and executive stakeholders. The stakeholder span of this role is equivalent to a senior TPM at Google or Amazon. My comp should reflect this span of influence."
4. **Delivery Velocity as Revenue Driver:** "Every month of delay in shipping Box AI features is a month of lost ARPU expansion from Enterprise Advanced upsells. My program management directly controls the pace at which Box monetizes its AI investments. This revenue acceleration impact justifies top-of-band comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Box's cross-product AI delivery challenge — coordinating Hubs, AI Studio, Enterprise Advanced, and core platform — is the kind of complex program management I excel at. I'm looking for $185K base, $150K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus target, putting TC at ~$231K. I have competing offers from Google TPM ($245K TC) and Amazon Senior TPM ($238K TC). Box's Hero Agent orchestration challenge is uniquely compelling — I need TC at $225K+ to accept. If the RSU grant lands at $142K+ and bonus target confirms at 15%, I'll sign."
