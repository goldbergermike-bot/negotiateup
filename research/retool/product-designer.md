**Negotiation DNA**

Retool Product Designers shape the developer tools experience for 30K+ companies — designing the drag-and-drop builder, code editor, AI generation interfaces, and component library that developers use to build internal tools. In February 2026, design is central to Retool's AI transformation: making AI app generation feel intuitive, designing natural language interfaces for tool building, and creating UX patterns that blend manual building with AI assistance.

Retool's design challenge is unique — designing for developers who expect both the speed of visual building and the power of code. Product Designers at Retool must understand developer workflows deeply and create interfaces that serve both technical and non-technical users.

### 🏗️ Retool AI Builder UX Lever

Retool's 2026 AI features require Product Designers to invent new interaction paradigms for AI-powered internal tool building — designing how developers interact with natural language app generation, how AI suggestions appear in the visual builder, and how vector search results integrate into tool workflows. The design challenge is creating AI UX that accelerates development without reducing developer control.

Product Designers must balance the power of AI generation with the precision developers demand — designing interfaces that show AI confidence levels, allow granular editing of AI-generated components, and maintain the "lego-like" composability that makes Retool powerful.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Builder UX Design:** "I design the AI-powered builder experience for Retool — natural language app generation, AI component suggestions, and AI-assisted workflow design for 30K+ companies. Making AI feel helpful without reducing developer control is one of the hardest design challenges in developer tools."
2. **Developer Tools Design Expertise:** "I design for developers — a uniquely demanding audience. Every interaction pattern must balance visual building speed with code-level control, serving both technical and non-technical builders."
3. **Component & Design System:** "I own Retool's component library and design system — the building blocks used by developers at 30K+ companies. My design decisions define the visual language of internal tools across industries."
4. **Figma/Vercel/Linear Competition:** "Figma, Vercel, and Linear are hiring designers for AI-powered developer experiences. Retool must offer competitive comp to retain designers who understand developer tool UX."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $205K base and $240K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Product Designer role. I design AI-powered builder experiences for Retool's developer platform across 30K+ companies. Designers who understand both AI interaction patterns and developer tool UX are rare. I have competing offers from [Figma at $305K TC / Vercel at $292K TC / Google at $320K TC]. Product designers with AI developer tools expertise are in exceptional demand." Accept at $180K+ base and $195K+ RSUs.
