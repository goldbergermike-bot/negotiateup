### 🏗️ Retool AI Platform Engineering Leadership Lever

Retool's 2026 AI strategy requires Engineering Managers to lead teams building AI-powered internal tools capabilities — from natural language app generation to vector search to AI workflow automation. The leadership challenge involves managing teams that span traditional product engineering and ML/AI disciplines while maintaining the platform reliability that 30K+ companies depend on.

EMs must balance rapid AI feature delivery with platform stability, manage the unique complexity of supporting both cloud and self-hosted deployments, and build engineering teams that can operate across the full stack from AI models to drag-and-drop UI components.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Platform Team Leadership:** "I lead the engineering team building Retool's AI capabilities — Retool AI, Vectors, and AI workflows for 30K+ companies. Managing cross-disciplinary teams across ML and platform engineering for an AI-powered developer tool requires rare leadership expertise."
2. **Developer Platform Complexity:** "Retool's platform connects to 50+ data sources with drag-and-drop UI, custom code, and AI generation. I lead teams building across this complex surface while maintaining the reliability developers depend on."
3. **Dual-Deployment Engineering:** "I manage engineering teams delivering features across cloud and self-hosted deployments — a unique challenge requiring careful release engineering and feature parity management."
4. **Vercel/Supabase/Appsmith Competition:** "Vercel, Supabase, and Appsmith are competing for engineering leaders in the developer tools space. Retool must offer competitive leadership comp to retain EMs who can drive AI-powered platform development."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $255K base and $418K RSUs over 4 years with 20% performance bonus for this Engineering Manager role. I lead the team building Retool's AI capabilities — AI app generation, Vectors, and workflows for 30K+ companies. Engineering leaders who can drive AI platform development for developer tools are rare. I have competing offers from [Google EM at $460K TC / Vercel EM at $435K TC / Meta EM at $470K TC]. EMs with AI developer platform expertise are in exceptional demand." Accept at $228K+ base and $350K+ RSUs.
