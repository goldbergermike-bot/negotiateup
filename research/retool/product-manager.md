Retool Product Managers own the strategy and execution for internal tools platform features used by 30K+ companies — driving the roadmap for the visual builder, AI capabilities, data connectors, and enterprise features. In February 2026, PMs lead critical AI product decisions: how Retool AI generates apps from natural language, how Vectors enables AI-powered data retrieval, and how AI workflows automate business processes.

As a private company at ~$3.2B valuation with strong developer-led growth, Retool offers competitive PM compensation with equity upside. PMs at Retool have direct influence on product direction — the developer-focused GTM means product decisions directly drive adoption and revenue.
