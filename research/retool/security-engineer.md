**Negotiation DNA**

Retool Security Engineers protect the internal tools platform used by 30K+ companies — securing the builder environment, data connections, and AI features that access sensitive enterprise databases and APIs. In February 2026, security is paramount: Retool connects directly to production databases and internal systems, making the platform a high-value target. The AI expansion adds novel security challenges around prompt injection, AI-generated code security, and vector data isolation.

As a private company at ~$3.2B valuation serving enterprise customers including Fortune 500 companies, Retool invests heavily in security as a competitive differentiator. The August 2023 security incident underscored the importance of security engineering at Retool, and the company has since significantly expanded its security program.

### 🏗️ Retool AI & Platform Security Lever

Retool's 2026 AI features require Security Engineers to solve novel security challenges — preventing prompt injection in AI-generated internal tools, ensuring AI-generated code doesn't introduce vulnerabilities, securing vector data stores containing enterprise data, and maintaining security parity between cloud and self-hosted deployments. The security surface is uniquely broad: Retool connects to customer databases, APIs, and AI models simultaneously.

Security Engineers must build security controls that enable developers to build powerful internal tools quickly without compromising enterprise data protection — a constant balance between developer velocity and security rigor.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Code Generation Security:** "I build security controls for Retool's AI-generated internal tools — ensuring AI-generated code doesn't introduce SQL injection, XSS, or data leakage vulnerabilities. Securing AI-generated code at platform scale is a frontier security challenge."
2. **Enterprise Data Connection Security:** "Retool connects directly to production databases and internal APIs for 30K+ companies. I build the security controls that protect enterprise data at the platform layer — a uniquely sensitive attack surface."
3. **Self-Hosted Security Architecture:** "I design security architecture for enterprise self-hosted deployments — including air-gapped environments, custom SSO integration, and AI feature security controls within customer infrastructure."
4. **HashiCorp/Supabase/Snyk Competition:** "HashiCorp, Supabase, and Snyk are hiring security engineers for developer platform security. Retool must offer competitive comp to retain security talent who understand platform+AI security at enterprise scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $220K base and $268K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Security Engineer role. I build security controls for Retool's platform and AI features — protecting enterprise data connections for 30K+ companies. Security engineers with platform+AI security expertise are in extreme shortage. I have competing offers from [Google SecEng at $340K TC / HashiCorp at $318K TC / Snyk at $312K TC]. Security engineers who understand AI code generation security at platform scale are the scarcest security talent in 2026." Accept at $195K+ base and $218K+ RSUs.
