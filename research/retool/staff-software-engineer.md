### 🏗️ Retool AI Platform Architecture Strategy Lever

Retool's 2026 AI transformation requires Staff Software Engineers to define the technical architecture connecting AI capabilities to the core platform — making foundational decisions about how AI generation integrates with the visual builder, how vector search connects to the data connector layer, and how the platform evolves to support AI-first internal tool development.

Staff engineers must drive cross-team technical alignment on AI architecture decisions, establish patterns for AI feature development that maintain platform reliability, and mentor engineers through the platform's most complex technical challenges.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Platform Architecture:** "I define the technical architecture connecting AI to Retool's core platform — foundational decisions about AI generation, vector integration, and AI workflow systems that impact how 30K+ companies build internal tools."
2. **Platform Scalability Vision:** "I drive Retool's platform scalability strategy — architecting systems that support growing enterprise workloads, AI compute, and self-hosted deployments. These architectural decisions define Retool's technical trajectory."
3. **Cross-Team Technical Leadership:** "I set technical direction across Retool's engineering organization — driving alignment between platform, AI, and enterprise teams on architecture. Staff-level technical decisions shape the entire platform experience."
4. **Google/Vercel/Stripe Competition:** "Google, Vercel, and Stripe are competing for Staff engineers with AI platform architecture expertise. Retool must offer competitive comp to retain Staff talent defining the developer tools platform vision."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $268K base and $465K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Staff Software Engineer role. I define the AI architecture for Retool's platform — foundational decisions connecting AI capabilities to the visual builder, data connectors, and workflows for 30K+ companies. Staff engineers with AI developer platform architecture expertise are among the rarest in tech. I have competing offers from [Google L7 at $510K TC / Vercel Staff at $488K TC / Stripe Staff at $495K TC]. Staff engineers who can lead AI-integrated platform architecture are in extraordinary demand." Accept at $240K+ base and $392K+ RSUs.
