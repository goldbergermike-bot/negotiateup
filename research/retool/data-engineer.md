### Data Engineer | Retool Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Heavy (Private, ~$3.2B Valuation) + Bonus | Internal Tools & AI Workflow Platform | 30K+ Companies | **RETOOL AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $170K–$215K | $140K–$250K | 10–15% | $230K–$315K |
| New York | $165K–$210K | $135K–$242K | 10–15% | $222K–$305K |
| London | £112K–£142K | £92K–£165K | 10–15% | £148K–£205K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Retool Data Engineers build the data infrastructure powering the internal tools platform used by 30K+ companies — from query engine optimization to data connector pipelines to the analytics systems measuring platform usage and business metrics. In February 2026, Retool's AI expansion (Retool AI, Vectors, and AI-powered workflow automation) creates new data engineering challenges: building pipelines that support vector embeddings, AI model integration data, and real-time analytics across the platform.

As a private company valued at approximately $3.2B with strong developer community traction, Retool offers equity with meaningful upside potential. The platform serves companies from startups to Fortune 500, and Data Engineers directly impact the reliability and performance of internal tools used across industries.

### 🏗️ Retool AI Workflow Data Infrastructure Lever

Retool's 2026 AI strategy — including Retool AI for natural language app building, Vectors for AI-powered data retrieval, and AI workflow automation — requires Data Engineers to build the data infrastructure supporting AI feature adoption at scale. This includes pipelines for vector embedding storage and retrieval, AI usage analytics, and data connectors that feed AI-powered internal tools.

Data Engineers must build infrastructure that supports the diverse data sources Retool connects to (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, REST APIs, GraphQL, and 50+ integrations) while adding AI-specific data layers for vector search and model context management.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Workflow Data Pipelines:** "I build the data infrastructure powering Retool's AI workflow features — vector embedding pipelines, AI usage analytics, and data connectors supporting AI-powered internal tools across 30K+ companies."
2. **Multi-Source Query Infrastructure:** "Retool connects to 50+ data sources. I build and optimize the query infrastructure that makes diverse databases, APIs, and services accessible through a unified platform — a unique data engineering challenge."
3. **Vector Data Infrastructure:** "I build the vector embedding storage and retrieval infrastructure powering Retool Vectors — enabling AI-powered search and retrieval across enterprise data sources for thousands of companies."
4. **Supabase/Hasura/Appsmith Competition:** "Supabase, Hasura, and Appsmith are hiring data engineers for platform data infrastructure. Retool must offer competitive comp to retain engineers who understand multi-source data platform engineering."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $208K base and $242K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Data Engineer role. I build the AI workflow data infrastructure for Retool — vector pipelines, multi-source query optimization, and analytics across 30K+ companies. Data engineers with platform-scale AI data infrastructure experience are scarce. I have competing offers from [Supabase at $300K TC / Google at $335K TC / Hasura at $290K TC]. Data engineers who can build AI-powered platform data systems are in strong demand." Accept at $185K+ base and $195K+ RSUs.
