**Negotiation DNA**

Retool AI Workflow Platform Engineers build the AI-powered workflow orchestration system that enables companies to automate business processes using natural language, AI agents, and intelligent routing — transforming Retool from a builder for UI-based internal tools to an AI-first workflow automation platform for 30K+ companies. In February 2026, this is Retool's most strategically critical new platform capability, as AI workflows represent the next major expansion of the internal tools category beyond traditional CRUD apps.

As a private company at ~$3.2B valuation making significant AI platform investments, Retool offers premium equity for engineers building its AI workflow system. This role sits at the intersection of AI orchestration, distributed systems, and developer experience — building the infrastructure that enables developers to create intelligent automated workflows.

### 🏗️ Retool AI Workflow Orchestration Lever

Retool's 2026 AI workflow strategy requires engineers to build a platform that orchestrates AI agents, LLM calls, data transformations, and human-in-the-loop steps into reliable automated workflows. The engineering challenge involves building a workflow execution engine that handles AI's inherent non-determinism — implementing retry logic for LLM failures, managing context windows across multi-step workflows, and building observability for AI-powered automation.

AI Workflow Platform Engineers must design systems that enable developers to compose AI capabilities with traditional data operations — combining vector search, LLM inference, database queries, and API calls into workflows that run reliably at enterprise scale with proper error handling and audit trails.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Workflow Orchestration Engine:** "I build Retool's AI workflow orchestration engine — enabling developers to compose AI agents, LLM calls, data operations, and human-in-the-loop steps into automated workflows for 30K+ companies. AI workflow orchestration at this platform scale is a frontier engineering challenge."
2. **AI Agent Infrastructure:** "I build the AI agent infrastructure powering Retool workflows — managing agent state, tool calling, and multi-step reasoning within automated business processes. Production AI agent systems require novel approaches to reliability and observability."
3. **Workflow Reliability at Scale:** "I build execution infrastructure that handles AI's non-determinism — retry logic for LLM failures, fallback strategies, and context management across multi-step AI workflows. Reliable AI workflow execution at enterprise scale requires specialized expertise."
4. **Temporal/n8n/Zapier Competition:** "Temporal, n8n, and Zapier are all building AI workflow capabilities. Retool must offer competitive comp to retain engineers who can build AI-powered workflow orchestration that integrates with the internal tools ecosystem."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base and $370K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this AI Workflow Platform Engineer role. I build Retool's AI workflow orchestration engine — enabling developers to automate business processes with AI agents, LLM calls, and data operations for 30K+ companies. Engineers who can build production AI workflow platforms are among the rarest talent in 2026. I have competing offers from [Google AI Platform at $418K TC / Temporal at $398K TC / OpenAI at $435K TC]. AI workflow platform engineers with production orchestration expertise are in extraordinary demand." Accept at $218K+ base and $308K+ RSUs.
