**Negotiation DNA**

Retool Senior Software Engineers are the technical backbone of the internal tools platform — building the visual builder, code execution engine, data connectors, and AI-powered features used by 30K+ companies. In February 2026, senior engineers lead the technical execution of Retool's AI integration, architecting how natural language app generation, vector search, and AI workflows connect to the core platform.

As a private company at ~$3.2B valuation with selective hiring, Retool offers significant equity for senior talent. Senior engineers have outsized impact — the platform's technical complexity (visual builder + code execution + 50+ data connectors + AI) means each senior engineer owns critical system components.

### 🏗️ Retool AI + Platform Integration Lever

Retool's 2026 AI strategy requires Senior Software Engineers to architect the integration between AI capabilities and the core platform — ensuring AI app generation produces well-structured, maintainable tools, that vector search connects seamlessly to the 50+ data sources, and that AI workflows integrate with the existing builder workflow. The engineering challenge is maintaining platform reliability while rapidly shipping AI features.

Senior engineers must make architectural decisions about how AI-generated components interact with the visual builder, manage state across AI-assisted building sessions, and ensure AI features work consistently across cloud and self-hosted deployments.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI-Platform Architecture:** "I architect the integration between Retool's AI features and core platform — ensuring AI-generated apps, vector search, and AI workflows work seamlessly with the visual builder and 50+ data connectors for 30K+ companies."
2. **Visual Builder + Code Engine:** "Retool's hybrid visual builder and code execution engine is one of the most complex developer tool architectures. I build and extend this system to support AI-generated components while maintaining the reliability developers depend on."
3. **Multi-Source Connector System:** "I build and maintain Retool's 50+ data source connectors — the integration layer that connects internal tools to databases, APIs, and services. Each connector must work with AI features, queries, and workflows."
4. **Vercel/Supabase/Appsmith Competition:** "Vercel, Supabase, and Appsmith are competing for senior engineers building AI developer tools. Retool must offer competitive comp to retain senior talent with platform architecture expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $228K base and $320K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Senior Software Engineer role. I architect the AI integration with Retool's platform — connecting AI generation, vectors, and workflows to the visual builder for 30K+ companies. Senior engineers with AI-integrated platform architecture expertise are rare. I have competing offers from [Google at $370K TC / Vercel at $352K TC / Supabase at $338K TC]. Senior engineers who can build AI-powered developer tool platforms are in peak demand." Accept at $200K+ base and $262K+ RSUs.
