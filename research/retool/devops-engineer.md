### DevOps Engineer | Retool Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Heavy (Private, ~$3.2B Valuation) + Bonus | Platform Infrastructure & AI Deployment | 30K+ Companies | **RETOOL AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $168K–$212K | $135K–$242K | 10–15% | $225K–$308K |
| New York | $163K–$208K | $130K–$235K | 10–15% | $218K–$300K |
| London | £110K–£140K | £88K–£160K | 10–15% | £142K–£200K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Retool DevOps Engineers own the infrastructure reliability and deployment systems for a platform serving 30K+ companies — managing multi-tenant cloud infrastructure, self-hosted deployment pipelines, and the emerging AI compute layer. In February 2026, the AI expansion adds significant infrastructure complexity: GPU compute management for AI features, vector database operations, and AI model serving alongside the core platform infrastructure.

As a private company at ~$3.2B valuation offering both cloud and self-hosted deployment models, Retool presents unique DevOps challenges. Engineers must maintain infrastructure for both SaaS customers and enterprise self-hosted deployments while scaling AI capabilities across both models.

### 🏗️ Retool AI & Self-Hosted Infrastructure Lever

Retool's 2026 AI features require DevOps Engineers to manage AI compute infrastructure alongside the core platform — orchestrating GPU resources for AI-powered app building, managing vector database clusters for Retool Vectors, and ensuring AI features work reliably in both cloud and self-hosted enterprise deployments. The unique challenge is supporting AI capabilities across two fundamentally different deployment models.

DevOps Engineers must build deployment pipelines that can roll out AI features to cloud customers instantly while providing self-hosted customers with upgrade paths that include AI capabilities within their own infrastructure — a dual-infrastructure challenge unique to Retool's business model.

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual-Deployment AI Infrastructure:** "I manage Retool's infrastructure across both cloud and self-hosted deployments — including AI compute orchestration, vector database operations, and model serving. Supporting AI features across two deployment models is a unique DevOps challenge."
2. **Multi-Tenant Platform Reliability:** "Retool serves 30K+ companies on shared infrastructure. I build the isolation, scaling, and monitoring systems that ensure 99.99% uptime while managing diverse workloads from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises."
3. **Enterprise Self-Hosted Operations:** "I design and maintain the self-hosted deployment infrastructure for enterprise customers — including Kubernetes operators, upgrade automation, and configuration management for on-premises AI capabilities."
4. **Vercel/Render/Supabase Competition:** "Vercel, Render, and Supabase are hiring DevOps engineers for platform infrastructure. Retool must offer competitive comp to retain engineers who can manage dual-deployment AI infrastructure."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $205K base and $235K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this DevOps Engineer role. I manage Retool's dual-deployment infrastructure — cloud and self-hosted — including AI compute and vector database operations for 30K+ companies. DevOps engineers with dual-deployment AI infrastructure expertise are rare. I have competing offers from [Google SRE at $310K TC / Vercel at $295K TC / Render at $280K TC]. Engineers who can manage AI platform infrastructure across deployment models are in peak demand." Accept at $180K+ base and $192K+ RSUs.
