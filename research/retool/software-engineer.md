### Software Engineer | Retool Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Heavy (Private, ~$3.2B Valuation) + Bonus | Internal Tools & AI Workflow Platform | 30K+ Companies | **RETOOL AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $155K–$200K | $125K–$228K | 10–15% | $210K–$288K |
| New York | $150K–$195K | $120K–$220K | 10–15% | $202K–$278K |
| London | £102K–£132K | £82K–£150K | 10–15% | £135K–£190K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Retool Software Engineers build the internal tools platform features used by 30K+ companies — from visual builder components and data connectors to AI-powered workflows and developer experience improvements. In February 2026, SWEs work across the full platform surface with growing exposure to AI feature development. The engineering culture values full-stack ownership and rapid iteration.

As a private company at ~$3.2B valuation with a strong developer community, Retool offers equity with meaningful growth potential even at the SWE level. The platform's technical breadth means each engineer gains exposure to diverse systems — UI rendering, code execution, database integrations, and AI features.

### 🏗️ Retool Platform Feature Development Lever

Retool's 2026 product roadmap requires Software Engineers to build and ship platform features at an accelerating pace — expanding the component library, adding new data connectors, building AI-powered builder features, and improving the developer experience across both cloud and self-hosted deployments.

SWEs must navigate the unique complexity of building developer tools — their users are developers themselves, demanding high performance, flexibility, and reliability. Features must work across 50+ data source types and both deployment models.

**Global Levers**

1. **Full-Stack Platform Development:** "I build features across Retool's full-stack platform — from the visual builder frontend to the code execution backend. Each feature I ship impacts how developers at 30K+ companies build internal tools."
2. **Developer-Facing Quality:** "I build for developers — the most demanding users. Every component, connector, and workflow I build must meet the performance and reliability standards that developers expect from their tools."
3. **AI Feature Integration:** "I integrate AI capabilities into the Retool platform — building interfaces where AI generation, suggestions, and automation enhance the manual building experience. Blending AI with developer tools requires careful engineering."
4. **Vercel/Appsmith/Supabase Competition:** "Vercel, Appsmith, and Supabase are hiring engineers for developer platform features. Retool must offer competitive comp to attract engineers who can build developer-grade platform features at pace."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $192K base and $220K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Software Engineer role. I build platform features for 30K+ companies on Retool — full-stack development across the visual builder, data connectors, and AI integrations. Engineers building developer tools at this scale gain broad technical experience. I have competing offers from [Google at $285K TC / Vercel at $270K TC / Appsmith at $255K TC]. Software engineers with developer platform expertise are in strong demand." Accept at $168K+ base and $178K+ RSUs.
