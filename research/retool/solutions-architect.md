**Negotiation DNA**

Retool Solutions Architects design and deploy enterprise internal tools platform configurations — architecting how large organizations structure their Retool environments, connect to data sources, implement AI features, and manage self-hosted deployments. In February 2026, the role is critical to Retool's enterprise growth, as SAs guide organizations through AI feature adoption, self-hosted deployment architecture, and complex data integration patterns.

As a private company at ~$3.2B valuation with accelerating enterprise adoption, Retool offers competitive SA compensation with equity upside. Solutions Architects directly influence enterprise deal size by demonstrating platform value through technical architecture design.

### 🏗️ Retool Enterprise AI Deployment Lever

Retool's 2026 enterprise AI strategy requires Solutions Architects to design deployment architectures for AI-powered internal tools in complex enterprise environments — addressing self-hosted infrastructure requirements, AI governance policies, data connection security, and workspace structures that leverage AI features across departments.

SAs must develop reference architectures for enterprise Retool deployments — including self-hosted Kubernetes configurations, SSO/SCIM integration patterns, and AI feature enablement within air-gapped and regulated environments.

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise AI Tools Architecture:** "I design Retool deployment architectures for enterprise organizations — structuring AI-powered internal tools, data connections, and access controls for thousands of developers across complex organizational structures."
2. **Self-Hosted Deployment Design:** "I architect self-hosted Retool deployments for enterprise customers — including Kubernetes configurations, high availability setups, and AI feature enablement within customer infrastructure. Each deployment directly enables enterprise deal closure."
3. **Complex Data Integration Patterns:** "I design data integration architectures connecting Retool to enterprise databases, APIs, and services — ensuring AI features work seamlessly with existing enterprise data infrastructure."
4. **Datadog/HashiCorp/Atlassian Competition:** "Datadog, HashiCorp, and Atlassian are hiring Solutions Architects for enterprise developer platform deployments. Retool must offer competitive comp to retain SAs who can design AI-powered enterprise internal tool architectures."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base and $255K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Solutions Architect role. I design enterprise deployment architectures for Retool — including self-hosted configurations, AI feature enablement, and complex data integrations. SAs with self-hosted AI platform deployment expertise are rare. I have competing offers from [Google Cloud SA at $328K TC / Datadog SA at $312K TC / AWS SA at $322K TC]. Solutions architects who can design enterprise AI internal tools architectures are in exceptional demand." Accept at $188K+ base and $208K+ RSUs.
