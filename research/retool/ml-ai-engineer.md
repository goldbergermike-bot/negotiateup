### ML/AI Engineer | Retool Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Heavy (Private, ~$3.2B Valuation) + Bonus | AI-Powered App Generation & Vector Intelligence | 30K+ Companies | **RETOOL AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $192K–$248K | $210K–$370K | 10–15% | $295K–$418K |
| New York | $188K–$242K | $205K–$360K | 10–15% | $288K–$408K |
| London | £128K–£165K | £138K–£245K | 10–15% | £192K–£275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Retool ML/AI Engineers build the AI systems powering intelligent internal tools — from natural language app generation (Retool AI) to vector search and retrieval (Retool Vectors) to AI-powered workflow automation for 30K+ companies. In February 2026, this is Retool's highest-growth engineering function, as AI transforms how developers build internal tools from drag-and-drop to natural language prompts.

As a private company at ~$3.2B valuation investing heavily in AI, Retool offers premium equity for ML/AI talent. The competitive landscape for AI engineers who can build production code-generation and developer tools is intense, with GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Vercel all competing for similar talent.

### 🏗️ Retool AI App Generation & Vectors Lever

Retool's 2026 AI roadmap requires ML/AI Engineers to build production systems for natural language app generation — translating developer prompts into functional internal tools with database connections, API integrations, and UI components. The ML challenge involves understanding developer intent, generating correct code across multiple frameworks, and maintaining context across complex multi-step app building sessions.

ML/AI Engineers also build Retool Vectors — the platform's vector search and retrieval system that enables AI-powered data intelligence across enterprise data sources. This requires expertise in embedding models, retrieval-augmented generation, and production vector database operations.

**Global Levers**

1. **Natural Language App Generation:** "I build Retool AI's natural language app generation — translating developer prompts into functional internal tools with database connections, API integrations, and UI components for 30K+ companies. Production code generation at this complexity is a frontier ML challenge."
2. **Retool Vectors Platform:** "I build Retool Vectors — the vector search and retrieval system enabling AI-powered data intelligence across enterprise data sources. Building production vector infrastructure that works across 50+ data source types requires specialized ML expertise."
3. **Developer Intent Understanding:** "I build models that understand developer intent in the context of internal tools — mapping natural language to database queries, API calls, and UI layouts. This domain-specific code generation is more constrained and complex than general-purpose code completion."
4. **GitHub Copilot/Cursor/Vercel Competition:** "GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Vercel v0 are competing for ML engineers who can build AI-powered developer tools. Retool must offer competitive comp to retain ML talent who understand production code generation for internal tools."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $240K base and $360K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this ML/AI Engineer role. I build the AI systems powering Retool AI app generation and Vectors — natural language to functional internal tools for 30K+ companies. ML engineers with production code generation expertise for developer tools are in extreme shortage. I have competing offers from [GitHub at $410K TC / Google ML at $420K TC / Cursor at $395K TC]. AI engineers who can build intelligent developer tools are the scarcest talent in 2026." Accept at $212K+ base and $298K+ RSUs.
