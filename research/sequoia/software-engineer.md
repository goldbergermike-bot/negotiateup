#### Negotiation DNA

Sequoia Software Engineers build the internal platform infrastructure, portfolio analytics tools, and investment management systems that power the world's most prestigious venture capital firm. Unlike public-tech SWE roles, Sequoia compensation is structured as Base + Bonus + Carry across fund vintages — there is no public equity. The 20% CV-based distribution model means a meaningful portion of your long-term wealth comes through continuation vehicle payouts rather than traditional fund exit waterfalls. As a private partnership, Sequoia's permanent capital restructuring (from traditional fund cycles to an open-ended fund structure) fundamentally changed how employees access liquidity. Candidates must understand that carry vesting at Sequoia is tied to fund performance across a portfolio that includes Apple, Google, Airbnb, and Stripe — the highest-signal portfolio in venture capital history. Negotiation leverage comes from demonstrating platform engineering depth and the ability to build systems that directly impact investment decision-making velocity.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

Sequoia's 20% CV-based distribution model is the single most important compensation variable that candidates consistently fail to negotiate. When Sequoia moves a portfolio company into a continuation vehicle rather than distributing shares at IPO or acquisition, employees with carry allocation receive distributions from these CVs — typically at 20% of the carried interest pool. The "Private for Longer" dynamic is central to Sequoia's strategy: portfolio companies like Stripe remained private for over a decade, and Sequoia's permanent capital structure means there is no forced exit timeline.

For Software Engineers, this creates a critical negotiation opportunity: **Direct Secondary Market Access**. Candidates should explicitly negotiate for the right to sell vested carry interests on secondary markets (e.g., through Sequoia-approved platforms or structured liquidity windows). The estimated annual value of secondary access ranges from $40K-$60K at the SWE level, but this compounds significantly as carry vests over 4-8 year horizons.

Key CV negotiation points for Software Engineers:
- Request written confirmation of CV distribution participation for all fund vintages you contribute to
- Negotiate for accelerated CV vesting if your platform work directly supports continuation vehicle infrastructure
- Confirm that secondary market access applies to all carry tranches, not just the primary fund allocation
- Understand the tax implications: CV distributions may be treated as long-term capital gains vs. ordinary income depending on hold period

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Carry Vintage Breadth:** "I'd like to discuss carry allocation across multiple fund vintages rather than a single fund. Given Sequoia's permanent capital structure, my contributions will span multiple investment cycles, and I want my carry to reflect that breadth. Specifically, I'm requesting carry participation in the current growth fund, the seed fund, and any active continuation vehicles."

2. **Lever 2 — Secondary Market Access Guarantee:** "One of my key compensation requirements is written confirmation of direct secondary market access for vested carry interests. I understand Sequoia has structured liquidity programs, and I want to ensure I can participate in secondary transactions at my discretion after the standard vesting cliff, rather than being locked into fund-timeline-dependent distributions."

3. **Lever 3 — Base Salary Parity with Big Tech:** "My current offer from [Google/Meta/Stripe] is $[X] base with $[Y] in RSUs. While I understand Sequoia's carry model has significant upside, I need the base salary to be competitive at $195K+ to offset the liquidity risk of private carry versus publicly traded equity. The 20% CV distribution model reduces but does not eliminate this liquidity gap."

4. **Lever 4 — Signing Bonus as Liquidity Bridge:** "I'm forgoing $[X] in unvested RSUs at my current company. I'd like a signing bonus of $50K-$75K to bridge the liquidity gap during the carry vesting cliff period. This is standard practice at a16z and Lightspeed for candidates leaving public-equity positions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $195K+ base (up from initial $175K offer) and $140K+ carry/bonus. Use competing offers from Stripe ($205K base + $180K RSU) or Google L4 ($190K base + $200K RSU) as anchors. Emphasize that Sequoia's private carry requires a base premium to offset liquidity risk. Push for secondary market access worth $40K-$60K annually. Walk-away floor: Accept at $185K+ base and $120K+ carry with confirmed secondary access and multi-vintage carry participation. Below $185K base without secondary access, the liquidity discount makes public-tech offers mathematically superior.
