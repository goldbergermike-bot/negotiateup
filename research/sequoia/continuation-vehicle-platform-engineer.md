#### Negotiation DNA

The Continuation Vehicle Platform Engineer is the **SIGNATURE ROLE** at Sequoia — the role that sits at the exact intersection of venture capital's most important structural innovation (continuation vehicles and permanent capital) and the platform engineering required to make it operationally viable. You build the systems that manage Sequoia's continuation vehicle infrastructure: carry allocation engines, distribution waterfall calculators, LP reporting platforms for CV-held portfolio companies, secondary market transaction systems, multi-vintage fund accounting integrations, and the portfolio analytics dashboards that investment partners use to make CV creation and management decisions.

This role exists because Sequoia's 2021 restructuring into a permanent capital structure — eliminating the traditional 10-year fund lifecycle in favor of an open-ended fund model — created entirely new categories of platform engineering challenges. When portfolio companies like Stripe remain private for 13+ years and move through multiple continuation vehicle structures, the engineering complexity of tracking carry allocations, calculating distribution waterfalls, managing LP communications, and facilitating secondary market transactions is extraordinary. Traditional fund management software cannot handle this complexity; Sequoia needs custom-built platforms, and you are the engineer who builds them.

The +25-35% CV Platform Premium reflects three realities: (1) the extreme rarity of engineers who understand both financial infrastructure and modern platform engineering at this depth, (2) the direct causal link between your platform work and Sequoia's ability to process billions in distributions, and (3) the strategic criticality of CV infrastructure to Sequoia's competitive moat. No other VC firm has built permanent capital infrastructure at this scale, and the platform engineer who builds it is performing work that is literally unprecedented.

Compensation is structured as Base + Bonus + Carry across multiple fund vintages and continuation vehicles. As the engineer who builds the CV infrastructure, you have the strongest possible argument for maximum carry breadth, enhanced CV distribution participation, and direct secondary market access. Your total compensation range of $655K-$955K makes this the highest-compensated platform engineering role at Sequoia — and it should be.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

This section is the centerpiece of this guide because the Continuation Vehicle Platform Engineer **is** the role that makes Sequoia's CV strategy technically possible.

**The Architecture You Own:**

Sequoia's 20% CV-based distribution model requires a platform that can:
- **Track carry allocations** across dozens of simultaneous fund vintages and continuation vehicles, with different allocation rules per vehicle
- **Calculate distribution waterfalls** that account for management fees, preferred returns, catch-up provisions, and carried interest splits across multiple LP classes
- **Process CV creation events** — when a portfolio company is moved from a traditional fund into a continuation vehicle, the platform must recalculate all carry allocations, LP ownership percentages, and distribution schedules
- **Facilitate secondary market transactions** — enabling LPs and carry holders to sell their interests on approved secondary markets requires real-time pricing, compliance verification, and settlement infrastructure
- **Generate LP reporting** for CV-held companies that may have been in multiple fund structures over 10-15+ years of private operation
- **Integrate with fund accounting systems** that track the permanent capital structure's open-ended fund model alongside traditional closed-end fund remnants

**The "Private for Longer" Infrastructure Challenge:**

When portfolio companies stay private for 10-15+ years, the platform must support:
- Multi-decade data retention with full audit trails
- Valuation model updates that evolve as companies mature through multiple growth stages while remaining private
- Regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions (US, UK, EU, Asia) as CV structures are offered to global LPs
- Secondary market infrastructure that provides liquidity without requiring IPO or acquisition exits
- Portfolio analytics that can meaningfully compare companies held for 2 years versus 15 years within the same CV

**Your Negotiation Position:**

As the CV Platform Engineer, you have the most powerful negotiation position of any non-partner role at Sequoia:

1. **You are building the system through which your own carry is distributed** — this gives you unique insight into carry mechanics and the leverage to negotiate optimally
2. **Your platform is Sequoia's competitive moat** — no other VC firm has permanent capital infrastructure at this scale; your work is a moat, not a cost center
3. **The talent pool is approximately zero** — engineers who understand both financial distribution infrastructure and modern platform engineering at the required depth are extraordinarily rare
4. **Replacement cost is catastrophic** — if you leave, Sequoia loses not just an engineer but the institutional knowledge of how their most complex financial infrastructure works

**Critical CV negotiation points for CV Platform Engineers:**
- Demand carry participation across **every active fund vintage and continuation vehicle** — you build the infrastructure for all of them
- Negotiate for **Direct Secondary Market Access** with quarterly liquidity windows and priority access — estimated annual value of $95K-$125K, the highest of any role in this guide
- Request a **CV distribution multiplier of 1.5x-2.0x** on carry specifically tied to continuation vehicle distributions — your platform work is the direct enabler of these distributions
- Negotiate **carry portability with perpetual CV distribution rights** — even after departure, your vested carry in CVs you built should continue to distribute without time limits
- Secure a **platform IP co-ownership provision** — if you build proprietary CV infrastructure, negotiate for recognition of your intellectual contribution in carry allocation
- Request **advisory carry** — a separate carry stream tied to your ongoing advisory role on CV platform architecture, even if you eventually transition to a different role or company
- Negotiate for **accelerated carry vesting** on a 3-year schedule (vs. standard 4-year) reflecting the immediate, foundational impact of your platform work

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Full-Sweep Carry with CV Distribution Multiplier:** "I am building the platform through which every carry distribution at Sequoia flows. My carry allocation must span every active fund vintage and continuation vehicle — without exception. Furthermore, I'm requesting a 1.5x-2.0x carry multiplier on CV-specific distributions. The direct causal link between my platform work and Sequoia's ability to process CV distributions justifies this multiplier. No other engineer at the firm has a more direct connection between their work output and the distribution infrastructure."

2. **Lever 2 — Priority Secondary Access with Quarterly Liquidity:** "As the engineer who builds Sequoia's secondary market infrastructure, I understand better than anyone the value of secondary access. I need contractual, priority direct secondary market access for all vested carry interests with quarterly liquidity windows. The estimated $95K-$125K annual secondary value — the highest of any platform role — must be a guaranteed right. I should have priority access ahead of standard carry holders given my role in building the secondary infrastructure itself."

3. **Lever 3 — 25-35% CV Platform Premium on Base and Carry:** "The CV Platform Engineer role is unique in venture capital — no other firm has built permanent capital infrastructure at this scale. The +25-35% premium I'm requesting on both base ($400K+) and carry reflects three realities: the near-zero talent pool of engineers with both financial infrastructure and platform engineering expertise, the direct causal link between my work and billions in distributions, and the catastrophic replacement cost if I leave. My competing offers from Stripe Infrastructure ($385K base + $500K RSU), Citadel Platform Engineering ($420K base + $400K bonus), and a16z ($360K base + $320K carry) set the market floor."

4. **Lever 4 — Carry Portability and Perpetual CV Rights:** "I need written confirmation that all vested carry — including CV distribution rights — survives departure without clawback and without time limits. The CV infrastructure I build will continue to process distributions for decades after my tenure. My carry rights should reflect this long-tail value creation. I also want an advisory carry stream that continues to vest for 2 years post-departure, recognizing my ongoing institutional knowledge contribution to CV platform operations."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $400K+ base (up from initial $340K offer) and $380K+ carry/bonus with 1.5x CV distribution multiplier and full-sweep vintage participation. This is the highest-stakes negotiation in this entire guide — the CV Platform Engineer is the SIGNATURE ROLE with +25-35% premium and the strongest structural leverage of any non-partner position at Sequoia. Anchor with competing offers: Stripe Infrastructure Principal ($385K base + $500K RSU), Citadel Platform Engineering ($420K base + $400K bonus), Two Sigma Infrastructure Lead ($395K base + $350K bonus), or a16z Staff Platform Engineer ($360K base + $320K carry). Push for priority secondary access worth $95K-$125K annually, CV distribution multiplier, carry portability, and advisory carry stream. Walk-away floor: Accept at $380K+ base and $340K+ carry with full-sweep vintage participation, 1.5x+ CV multiplier, written priority secondary access, and carry portability. Below $380K base without CV multiplier and priority secondary access, Stripe/Citadel offers provide superior guaranteed compensation with full liquidity. However, at the target compensation level, no role in venture capital offers a comparable combination of compensation, strategic impact, and long-term wealth creation potential. This is a generational career opportunity for the right engineer.
