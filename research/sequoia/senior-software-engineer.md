#### Negotiation DNA

Senior Software Engineers at Sequoia own significant technical systems end-to-end — portfolio data platforms, fund management infrastructure, LP reporting pipelines, and the internal tools that investment partners use daily. This is a high-autonomy role in a small engineering organization (typically 30-60 engineers), meaning individual impact is disproportionately visible compared to big-tech senior roles with thousands of engineers. Compensation follows Sequoia's private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry with no public equity component. At the Senior level, carry allocation becomes a material part of total compensation, and candidates must negotiate carry breadth across fund vintages. The 20% CV-based distribution structure means your long-term wealth accumulation depends heavily on understanding continuation vehicle mechanics and securing direct secondary market access. Sequoia's portfolio — Apple, Google, Airbnb, Stripe — represents the highest-returning venture portfolio in history, and carry tied to these legacy and future funds carries extraordinary upside.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

Sequoia's permanent capital restructuring eliminated the traditional 10-year fund lifecycle, replacing it with an open-ended structure where portfolio companies can remain private indefinitely. The 20% CV-based distribution model means that when a portfolio company is moved into a continuation vehicle — rather than being distributed to LPs at IPO or sale — carry holders receive 20% of the CV's carried interest pool. For Senior Software Engineers with multi-year tenure, this creates a compounding wealth effect: each year of service adds carry across new fund vintages while existing CV distributions continue to pay out.

The "Private for Longer" dynamic is especially relevant for Senior SWEs because your platform work directly enables Sequoia's ability to hold companies longer. If you build the portfolio analytics, valuation tools, or LP reporting systems that support continuation vehicle management, you have a direct argument for enhanced CV participation.

**Critical negotiation points for Senior Software Engineers:**
- Demand carry allocation across a minimum of 3 active fund vintages (seed, growth, and CV pools)
- Negotiate for **Direct Secondary Market Access** with a 1-year post-cliff liquidity window — the estimated $55K-$82K annual secondary access value should be contractually guaranteed, not discretionary
- Request a CV distribution schedule in writing — understand whether distributions are quarterly, semi-annual, or event-driven
- Negotiate for "catch-up" carry on continuation vehicles that were created before your start date but remain active during your tenure
- Confirm that your carry does not have a "good leaver / bad leaver" provision that forfeits CV distributions upon voluntary departure

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Multi-Vintage Carry Expansion:** "At the Senior level, I expect carry participation across multiple active fund vintages — not a single-fund allocation. Specifically, I'm requesting carry in the current growth fund, the seed/early-stage fund, and participation rights in any active continuation vehicles. My platform work will span all of these investment vehicles, and my carry should reflect that cross-fund impact."

2. **Lever 2 — Secondary Liquidity Window:** "I need a written guarantee of direct secondary market access for vested carry interests with a defined liquidity window — ideally quarterly or semi-annual. The Private-for-Longer dynamic means I could be waiting 8-12 years for traditional exit-based liquidity. A secondary access right valued at $55K-$82K annually is a non-negotiable requirement to offset the liquidity risk versus publicly traded equity at Google or Stripe."

3. **Lever 3 — Base Premium for Private-Partnership Risk:** "My competing offer from Stripe is $265K base with $300K in RSUs vesting over 4 years. Sequoia's carry model has significant upside, but the base needs to be at $260K+ to account for the inherent liquidity discount of private carry versus daily-liquid public stock. I'm also forgoing $[X] in unvested equity, which requires a signing bonus of $80K-$120K."

4. **Lever 4 — Accelerated Carry Vesting for Platform Impact:** "If my platform work directly supports continuation vehicle infrastructure — LP reporting, portfolio analytics, secondary market tooling — I'd like to negotiate accelerated carry vesting on a 3-year schedule instead of the standard 4-year cliff. My direct contribution to CV infrastructure justifies a faster path to carry participation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $265K+ base (up from initial $230K offer) and $220K+ carry/bonus with confirmed multi-vintage participation. Anchor with competing offers: Stripe Senior SWE ($265K base + $300K RSU), Google L5 ($255K base + $280K RSU), or a16z Senior Engineer ($250K base + $200K carry). Push hard for secondary market access worth $55K-$82K annually — this is the highest-leverage item unique to Sequoia's structure. Walk-away floor: Accept at $245K+ base and $180K+ carry with written secondary access rights and 3+ vintage carry breadth. Below $245K base without secondary access, Stripe/Google offers dominate on risk-adjusted total compensation.
