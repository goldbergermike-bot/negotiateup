#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at Sequoia build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers investment decision-making across the world's most prestigious venture capital firm. You own the pipelines that ingest, transform, and serve portfolio company data, fund performance metrics, deal flow analytics, LP reporting data, and continuation vehicle tracking information. In a firm managing $85B+ in assets across a permanent capital structure, data quality and pipeline reliability directly affect investment outcomes worth billions. Sequoia's proprietary data — performance metrics from portfolio companies like Apple, Google, Airbnb, and Stripe, combined with decades of deal flow history — is the firm's most valuable analytical asset, and data engineers are its custodians. Compensation follows the private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry with no public equity. The 20% CV-based distribution model means your carry depends on fund performance, while your data pipelines are the foundation upon which investment decisions and CV management operate.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

Data Engineers are the infrastructure backbone of Sequoia's continuation vehicle operations. The 20% CV-based distribution model relies on accurate, reliable data pipelines to track carry allocations across fund vintages, calculate distribution waterfalls, monitor portfolio company performance within CVs, and generate LP reporting data. Without robust data engineering, CV operations would be unable to process distributions accurately.

The "Private for Longer" dynamic creates exponential data complexity: each year a portfolio company stays private generates additional performance data, valuation updates, and reporting obligations. Over 10-15+ year hold periods, the data volume and pipeline complexity grow substantially. Data engineers who build scalable systems to handle this growth are performing work that directly enables Sequoia's permanent capital strategy.

**Critical CV negotiation points for Data Engineers:**
- Negotiate carry participation across all fund vintages where your data pipelines serve operations — if your pipelines feed seed, growth, and CV analytics, carry should span all three
- Demand **Direct Secondary Market Access** for vested carry — the estimated $42K-$58K annual secondary value is a critical liquidity mechanism
- Request a **data infrastructure criticality premium** — your pipelines are the foundation for every investment decision and CV distribution; carry should reflect this foundational role
- Negotiate for access to Sequoia's full proprietary data set as a professional development benefit — working with this data is a career-defining experience
- Confirm that carry vesting is time-based and not conditional on data pipeline SLA metrics
- Secure carry allocation that recognizes the cross-functional nature of data engineering — your pipelines serve every team and every fund

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Data Foundation Carry Premium:** "Every investment decision, LP report, and CV distribution at Sequoia flows through data pipelines I build and maintain. My data infrastructure is foundational to fund operations across all vintages. I'm requesting carry participation across all active fund vintages with a 10% data infrastructure premium reflecting the foundation-layer nature of my work."

2. **Lever 2 — Secondary Access for Pipeline-Critical Roles:** "My competing offer from [Snowflake/Databricks/Google] includes $[X] in publicly traded RSUs. Data engineering roles at these companies offer immediate liquidity. To offset the carry liquidity gap, I need contractual direct secondary market access for vested carry with semi-annual windows valued at approximately $42K-$58K annually."

3. **Lever 3 — Base Calibrated to Data Engineering Market:** "Senior Data Engineers at Snowflake command $220K+ base; at Databricks, $215K+; at Google, $210K+ with $250K RSU. Sequoia's base should be $220K+ to remain competitive with the data infrastructure talent market. I'm also requesting a signing bonus of $50K-$75K to compensate for $[X] in forfeited unvested equity."

4. **Lever 4 — Proprietary Data Access and Publication Rights:** "Sequoia's portfolio company data set — spanning decades of performance metrics from hundreds of companies including Apple, Google, Airbnb, and Stripe — is the most valuable proprietary data set in venture capital. I want guaranteed access to this data for my engineering work, plus the ability to publish anonymized infrastructure case studies. This non-monetary benefit has significant career value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $220K+ base (up from initial $185K offer) and $165K+ carry/bonus with data infrastructure premium. Anchor with competing offers: Snowflake Senior Data Engineer ($225K base + $230K RSU), Databricks Data Engineer ($218K base + $250K RSU), or a16z Data Engineer ($210K base + $150K carry). Push for secondary access worth $42K-$58K annually and proprietary data access guarantees. Walk-away floor: Accept at $205K+ base and $140K+ carry with written secondary access, multi-vintage participation, and data infrastructure carry premium. Below $205K base without secondary access, Snowflake/Databricks offers are financially superior on liquidity-adjusted basis.
