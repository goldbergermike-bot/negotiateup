#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at Sequoia own the infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and operational reliability of the firm's entire technology platform. In a private partnership managing $85B+ in assets, infrastructure reliability is non-negotiable — system downtime during a critical deal evaluation, LP reporting cycle, or continuation vehicle distribution event has direct financial consequences measured in millions. Sequoia's compact engineering organization means DevOps engineers manage infrastructure that would require 3-5x the headcount at a big-tech company, creating both outsized impact and outsized operational scope. Compensation follows the Base + Bonus + Carry model with no public equity. The 20% CV-based distribution model means your carry compensation depends on fund performance across Sequoia's legendary portfolio (Apple, Google, Airbnb, Stripe). DevOps engineers should negotiate aggressively on base salary and secondary access given the critical-path nature of infrastructure reliability in a financial services context.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

Sequoia's continuation vehicle infrastructure depends on reliable, secure, and compliant technology systems — all of which fall under DevOps ownership. The 20% CV-based distribution model requires systems that can accurately track carry allocations across multiple fund vintages, process distribution calculations, and maintain audit trails for LP reporting. When CV distribution events occur, the underlying infrastructure must execute flawlessly.

The "Private for Longer" dynamic increases operational complexity: longer hold periods mean more data to manage, more reporting cycles to support, and more complex multi-vintage fund accounting to keep running. DevOps engineers who maintain this infrastructure have a direct claim to enhanced carry compensation.

**Critical CV negotiation points for DevOps Engineers:**
- Negotiate carry participation across fund vintages where your infrastructure supports operations — if your systems serve all funds, your carry should span all funds
- Demand **Direct Secondary Market Access** for vested carry — the estimated $35K-$55K annual secondary value should be contractually guaranteed
- Request an **infrastructure criticality premium** — argue that infrastructure downtime during CV distribution events or LP reporting cycles has measurable financial impact, justifying a carry supplement
- Negotiate for on-call compensation or additional carry grants tied to high-availability SLA commitments
- Confirm that carry vesting is not conditional on uptime metrics — vesting should be time-based, with SLA performance reflected in bonus, not carry forfeiture
- Secure a **compliance and security infrastructure premium** if you manage SOC 2, data protection, or financial regulatory compliance systems

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Infrastructure Criticality Carry Premium:** "Sequoia's entire investment operation runs on the infrastructure I manage. Downtime during a deal evaluation, LP reporting cycle, or CV distribution event has direct financial consequences. My carry allocation should include a criticality premium of 10-15% above standard DevOps allocation, reflecting the mission-critical nature of this infrastructure."

2. **Lever 2 — Secondary Access for Liquidity Management:** "My competing offer from [AWS/Google Cloud/Datadog] includes $[X] in publicly traded RSUs. Without secondary market access, Sequoia's carry model creates a significant liquidity gap. I need a contractual guarantee of direct secondary market access for vested carry, with semi-annual windows valued at approximately $35K-$55K annually."

3. **Lever 3 — Base Premium for Financial-Grade Infrastructure:** "DevOps engineers managing financial services infrastructure at Goldman Sachs, Citadel, or Two Sigma command $180K-$240K base. Sequoia's infrastructure has equivalent compliance, reliability, and security requirements. The base should be at $195K+ to reflect the financial-grade operational standards, not benchmarked against startup DevOps roles."

4. **Lever 4 — On-Call and Operational Scope Compensation:** "Given Sequoia's global operations across Menlo Park, San Francisco, and London, I'll be maintaining infrastructure across multiple time zones with on-call responsibilities. I want either a dedicated on-call bonus of $15K-$25K annually or additional carry grants that reflect the 24/7 operational commitment required for a $85B+ AUM platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $195K+ base (up from initial $165K offer) and $145K+ carry/bonus with infrastructure criticality premium. Anchor with competing offers: Google SRE ($195K base + $200K RSU), AWS Infrastructure Engineer ($185K base + $180K RSU), or Datadog Senior DevOps ($190K base + $160K RSU). Push for secondary access worth $35K-$55K annually and on-call compensation. Walk-away floor: Accept at $185K+ base and $120K+ carry with written secondary access and criticality premium. Below $185K base without secondary access, big-tech SRE/DevOps offers are financially superior due to full RSU liquidity and lower operational risk.
