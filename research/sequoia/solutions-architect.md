#### Negotiation DNA

Solutions Architects at Sequoia design and implement the end-to-end technical architecture that connects investment workflows, portfolio data systems, LP reporting platforms, and fund accounting infrastructure. This is a systems-thinking role that bridges business requirements from investment partners and operations teams with engineering execution. In Sequoia's lean organization, the Solutions Architect owns architectural decisions that would typically be distributed across multiple teams at a big-tech company — from data pipeline design to API architecture to third-party integration strategy. The role requires deep understanding of financial systems (fund accounting, carry calculations, distribution waterfalls) combined with modern software architecture expertise. Compensation follows the private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry with no public equity. The 20% CV-based distribution model means your long-term wealth depends on carry allocation across fund vintages, and your architectural decisions directly affect how efficiently Sequoia manages its permanent capital structure across a portfolio that includes Apple, Google, Airbnb, and Stripe.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

Solutions Architects are uniquely positioned in Sequoia's continuation vehicle ecosystem because they design the system architectures that enable CV operations. The 20% CV-based distribution model requires integrated systems that can track carry allocations across multiple fund vintages, calculate distribution waterfalls, manage LP reporting across traditional funds and CVs simultaneously, and support secondary market transactions.

The "Private for Longer" dynamic creates increasing architectural complexity over time: as portfolio companies remain private for 10-15+ years and move through multiple continuation vehicle structures, the underlying data architecture must scale to support multi-decade portfolio management. Solutions Architects who design these systems have a strong claim to enhanced carry participation.

**Critical CV negotiation points for Solutions Architects:**
- Negotiate carry participation across all fund vintages where your architectural work supports operations — your system designs span the entire fund portfolio
- Demand **Direct Secondary Market Access** for vested carry — the estimated $45K-$62K annual secondary value is a critical liquidity tool
- Request an **architectural impact premium** on carry if your designs directly support CV infrastructure — fund accounting, distribution waterfall calculations, or LP reporting systems
- Negotiate for technology decision-making authority as a non-monetary benefit — the ability to select tools, platforms, and architectural patterns has significant career value
- Confirm that carry vesting is not conditional on system uptime metrics or project delivery timelines beyond standard expectations
- Secure carry allocation that reflects the cross-functional nature of the role — your work touches every team, and carry should reflect that breadth

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Cross-Functional Architecture Carry:** "My architectural decisions affect every team and every fund at Sequoia. I'm designing systems that span deal flow, portfolio management, LP reporting, and CV infrastructure. My carry allocation should reflect this cross-functional impact with participation across all active fund vintages — seed, growth, and continuation vehicles."

2. **Lever 2 — Secondary Access for Private Architecture Premium:** "My competing offer from [Stripe/Palantir/Snowflake] includes $[X] in publicly traded RSUs. Sequoia's architectural role has extraordinary scope, but the carry liquidity gap requires a direct secondary market access guarantee. I need contractual semi-annual liquidity windows for vested carry, valued at approximately $45K-$62K annually."

3. **Lever 3 — Base Calibrated to Financial Systems Architecture:** "Solutions Architects building financial systems at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, or Citadel command $220K-$280K base. Sequoia's fund management infrastructure has equivalent complexity and regulatory sensitivity. The base should be $230K+ to reflect financial-grade architectural requirements, not benchmarked against standard tech company SA roles."

4. **Lever 4 — Technology Authority and Decision-Making Scope:** "As Solutions Architect, I need written confirmation of architectural decision-making authority — the ability to select technology platforms, define integration patterns, and set engineering standards. At Sequoia's scale, these decisions are made by the SA, not by committee. I also want a professional development budget of $15K-$25K annually for conference attendance and vendor relationship building."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $230K+ base (up from initial $190K offer) and $175K+ carry/bonus with cross-functional carry participation. Anchor with competing offers: Palantir Solutions Architect ($235K base + $250K RSU), Stripe Technical Architect ($225K base + $270K RSU), or a16z Solutions Architect ($220K base + $160K carry). Push for secondary access worth $45K-$62K annually. Walk-away floor: Accept at $215K+ base and $150K+ carry with written secondary access, full-vintage carry participation, and architectural authority. Below $215K base without secondary access, Palantir/Stripe SA offers are financially superior.
