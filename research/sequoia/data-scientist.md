#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at Sequoia sit at the most strategically valuable intersection in venture capital: quantitative analysis applied to investment decision-making. You build the models, analytics pipelines, and data infrastructure that help Sequoia's partners evaluate deals, monitor portfolio companies, forecast fund returns, and optimize continuation vehicle structures. This is not academic data science — your models directly influence billions of dollars in investment allocation decisions across Sequoia's permanent capital structure. The firm's legendary portfolio (Apple, Google, Airbnb, Stripe) generates proprietary data sets that are unmatched in the VC ecosystem, and your work with this data creates compounding information advantages. Compensation follows the private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry. The 20% CV-based distribution model is particularly relevant for data scientists because your analytical work directly supports CV creation and management decisions — when your models help determine which portfolio companies move to continuation vehicles, you are literally shaping the distribution mechanics of your own carry.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

Data Scientists at Sequoia have an unusually direct relationship with continuation vehicle economics. The 20% CV-based distribution model depends on quantitative analysis to determine which portfolio companies should be moved into CVs, how CVs should be priced, and when CV liquidity events should be triggered. As a data scientist, your models may directly influence these decisions, creating a unique alignment between your work output and your compensation structure.

The "Private for Longer" dynamic creates demand for sophisticated analytical tools: when companies stay private for 10-15+ years, Sequoia needs advanced forecasting models, valuation frameworks, and portfolio optimization algorithms that only skilled data scientists can build. This makes the role strategically critical and strengthens your negotiation position.

**Critical CV negotiation points for Data Scientists:**
- Negotiate carry participation across all fund vintages where your analytical models are deployed — if your models serve the growth fund, seed fund, and CV management, your carry should span all three
- Demand **Direct Secondary Market Access** for vested carry — the estimated $52K-$67K annual secondary value is a core compensation component
- Request an **analytics impact premium** — if your models directly inform CV creation or pricing decisions, negotiate a 10-20% carry premium reflecting the direct causal link between your work and fund returns
- Negotiate for access to portfolio company data as a professional development benefit — Sequoia's proprietary data set is a career-defining asset
- Confirm that your carry vesting schedule is aligned with model deployment timelines, not just calendar-based cliffs
- Request that any quantitative models you build that become core to fund operations trigger additional carry grants

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Analytical Alpha Carry Premium:** "My models directly influence investment decisions worth billions. If my analytical work informs CV creation decisions, portfolio valuations, or fund allocation optimization, I want a carry premium of 10-20% above the standard data scientist allocation. The causal link between my quantitative output and fund returns justifies this premium."

2. **Lever 2 — Secondary Access with Quantitative Justification:** "I can quantify the liquidity discount of private carry versus public RSUs — it's approximately 15-25% depending on hold period assumptions. To close this gap, I need contractual secondary market access for vested carry. The estimated $52K-$67K annual secondary value should be a guaranteed right, and I'd like quarterly liquidity windows."

3. **Lever 3 — Base Calibration Against Quant Finance:** "Top data science roles at Two Sigma, Citadel, and D.E. Shaw offer $250K-$350K base with performance bonuses of $200K+. Sequoia's base needs to be competitive at $250K+ to attract talent from quantitative finance. While carry upside is significant, the base must reflect the opportunity cost of leaving liquid compensation environments."

4. **Lever 4 — Proprietary Data Access Guarantee:** "Sequoia's portfolio data — performance metrics, growth trajectories, market data from Apple, Google, Airbnb, Stripe, and hundreds of other companies — is the most valuable proprietary data set in venture capital. I want a written guarantee of broad data access for my analytical work, plus the right to publish anonymized research findings. This is a non-monetary benefit that has significant career value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $255K+ base (up from initial $210K offer) and $210K+ carry/bonus with analytical alpha premium. Anchor with competing offers: Two Sigma Data Scientist ($280K base + $200K bonus), Google L5 Research Scientist ($250K base + $280K RSU), or a16z Data Scientist ($240K base + $180K carry). Push for secondary access worth $52K-$67K annually and proprietary data access guarantees. Walk-away floor: Accept at $240K+ base and $170K+ carry with written secondary access, multi-vintage participation, and analytics impact premium. Below $240K base without secondary access, quant finance and big-tech data science offers are financially superior.
