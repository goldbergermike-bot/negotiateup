#### Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at Sequoia craft the interfaces and experiences for the firm's internal investment platform — deal flow tools, portfolio analytics dashboards, LP reporting portals, and the continuation vehicle management systems that partners and operators use daily. This is a rare opportunity to design financial products at the intersection of venture capital and technology for an audience of the world's most sophisticated investors. Sequoia's lean design team (typically 3-8 designers) means outsized individual impact and direct collaboration with investment partners — there is no design bureaucracy. Compensation follows the private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry with no public equity. At the design level, carry allocation is smaller than engineering roles but still represents a significant portion of total compensation through the 20% CV-based distribution model. Candidates from big-tech design roles (Google, Apple, Meta) must negotiate carefully to ensure the base salary offsets the liquidity trade-off of private carry versus public RSUs.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

Sequoia's 20% CV-based distribution model applies to all carry-eligible employees, including Product Designers. While carry allocation at the design level is typically smaller than engineering or PM roles, the continuation vehicle dynamics still represent a material component of total compensation over a multi-year tenure.

The "Private for Longer" dynamic is especially relevant for designers because you are building the interfaces through which partners evaluate whether to move portfolio companies into continuation vehicles, how LPs view CV performance, and how secondary market transactions are facilitated. Your design decisions directly shape the usability of Sequoia's CV infrastructure.

**Critical CV negotiation points for Product Designers:**
- Negotiate for carry participation across at least 2-3 active fund vintages — even at the design level, your work spans multiple funds
- Demand **Direct Secondary Market Access** for vested carry — the estimated $30K-$48K annual secondary value is meaningful at the design comp level and should be a contractual right
- Request a **design impact carry supplement** — if your design work touches CV management tools, LP dashboards, or portfolio analytics, argue for a carry bump that reflects the strategic importance of these interfaces
- Confirm that carry vesting is on a standard 4-year schedule with no unusual clawback provisions for designers
- Understand that CV distributions at the design level may be smaller per-event but compound across multiple vintages and years of tenure
- Negotiate for carry parity with PM roles if you are functioning as a product designer-PM hybrid (common in small VC platform teams)

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Design-as-Strategy Carry Allocation:** "At Sequoia, design decisions directly affect how $85B+ in assets are visualized, reported, and managed. My carry allocation should reflect the strategic nature of design at a VC platform level — not be discounted relative to engineering or PM roles. I'm requesting carry across at least 3 active fund vintages with parity to PM-level allocations."

2. **Lever 2 — Secondary Access as Financial Safety Net:** "My competing offer from [Apple/Google/Figma] includes $[X] in publicly traded RSUs. Without secondary market access for vested carry, Sequoia's compensation is materially less liquid. I need a written guarantee of direct secondary market access with semi-annual liquidity windows, valued at approximately $30K-$48K annually."

3. **Lever 3 — Base Premium for Liquidity Risk:** "Senior Product Designer compensation at Apple is $175K base with $180K RSU; at Google, it's $170K base with $200K RSU. Sequoia's base must reach $180K+ to offset the liquidity risk of private carry. I'm also requesting a signing bonus of $40K-$60K to compensate for $[X] in forfeited unvested equity."

4. **Lever 4 — Portfolio Design Credit:** "If my design work extends to portfolio company support — helping Sequoia portfolio companies with design reviews, brand systems, or product design mentorship — I want that scope reflected in either additional carry allocation or a direct bonus tied to portfolio company engagement hours."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $180K+ base (up from initial $150K offer) and $120K+ carry/bonus with multi-vintage participation. Anchor with competing offers: Apple Senior Designer ($175K base + $180K RSU), Google UX Designer ($170K base + $200K RSU), or Figma Senior Designer ($185K base + $160K RSU). Push for secondary access worth $30K-$48K annually. Walk-away floor: Accept at $170K+ base and $100K+ carry with written secondary access and carry parity to PM allocations. Below $170K base without secondary access, Apple/Google design offers are financially superior due to full RSU liquidity.
