#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at Sequoia orchestrate complex, cross-functional programs that span engineering, product, design, data science, and investment operations. In a firm managing $85B+ in assets through a permanent capital structure, TPMs coordinate the platform programs that keep investment operations running — fund system migrations, continuation vehicle platform builds, LP reporting system overhauls, and security/compliance infrastructure upgrades. Sequoia's lean organization means each TPM owns programs that would be split across 3-5 TPMs at Google or Meta, creating exceptional scope and visibility. The role requires deep technical literacy combined with stakeholder management skills that include working directly with senior investment partners. Compensation follows the private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry with no public equity. The 20% CV-based distribution model makes carry a material part of long-term compensation, and TPMs who manage CV-related programs have a direct argument for enhanced carry participation across Sequoia's legendary fund portfolio.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

TPMs at Sequoia often manage the programs that build and maintain continuation vehicle infrastructure. The 20% CV-based distribution model creates a direct link between program execution and carry compensation: when a TPM successfully delivers a CV management platform, LP reporting system, or secondary market integration, they are literally building the systems through which their own carry distributions will flow.

The "Private for Longer" dynamic increases program complexity over time. As portfolio companies remain private for extended periods and transition through multiple fund structures, the programs required to support these transitions become more complex — multi-year platform migrations, regulatory compliance upgrades, and cross-regional data architecture programs. TPMs who manage these long-horizon programs accumulate carry across multiple fund vintages and CV structures.

**Critical CV negotiation points for Technical Program Managers:**
- Negotiate carry participation across fund vintages where your programs deliver operational value — if you manage programs spanning seed, growth, and CV infrastructure, your carry should span all three
- Demand **Direct Secondary Market Access** for vested carry — the estimated $38K-$58K annual secondary value is essential for liquidity management
- Request a **program delivery carry bonus** — successfully delivering high-impact programs (CV platform builds, fund system migrations) should trigger additional carry grants
- Negotiate for program scope that includes CV infrastructure projects — these programs carry the highest strategic value and the strongest argument for enhanced carry
- Confirm that carry vesting is time-based and not conditional on program delivery milestones beyond standard performance expectations
- Secure a **cross-functional impact premium** — TPMs who coordinate across engineering, product, design, and investment operations create value that exceeds any single function's contribution

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Program Scope Carry Allocation:** "My programs span multiple teams, funds, and geographies. I'm coordinating work that affects every investment vehicle in Sequoia's portfolio. My carry allocation should reflect this cross-functional program scope with participation across all active fund vintages, not a single-fund allocation tied to one team's work."

2. **Lever 2 — Secondary Access for Program-Length Liquidity:** "Many of my programs will span 12-24 months. Combined with 4-year carry vesting and the Private-for-Longer hold periods, I could be waiting 8-15 years for traditional exit-based liquidity. I need contractual direct secondary market access for vested carry with semi-annual windows, valued at approximately $38K-$58K annually, to manage this extended liquidity timeline."

3. **Lever 3 — Base Calibration Against Big-Tech TPM:** "Senior TPM compensation at Google ranges from $210K-$260K base with $250K+ in RSUs; at Meta, it's $200K-$250K base with $300K+ RSUs. Sequoia's base must be competitive at $215K+ to offset carry liquidity risk. I'm also requesting a signing bonus of $50K-$80K to compensate for $[X] in forfeited unvested equity."

4. **Lever 4 — Program Delivery Carry Bonus:** "I want a written commitment to additional carry grants upon successful delivery of high-impact programs — CV platform builds, fund system migrations, or LP reporting overhauls. These milestone-based carry bonuses align my incentives with Sequoia's most strategically important initiatives and reward execution excellence beyond standard time-based vesting."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $215K+ base (up from initial $180K offer) and $155K+ carry/bonus with program delivery carry bonuses. Anchor with competing offers: Google Senior TPM ($225K base + $260K RSU), Meta TPM ($215K base + $300K RSU), or a16z TPM ($205K base + $145K carry). Push for secondary access worth $38K-$58K annually and milestone-based carry bonuses. Walk-away floor: Accept at $200K+ base and $130K+ carry with written secondary access, multi-vintage participation, and program delivery carry bonus commitment. Below $200K base without secondary access, Google/Meta TPM offers are financially superior on liquidity-adjusted basis.
