#### Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at Sequoia protect the most sensitive data in venture capital — deal flow intelligence, portfolio company financials, LP information, fund performance data, and carry distribution records. A security breach at Sequoia would have catastrophic consequences not only for the firm but for the entire VC ecosystem and hundreds of portfolio companies including Apple, Google, Airbnb, and Stripe. This makes security engineering at Sequoia a uniquely high-stakes role with commensurate responsibility. The firm's permanent capital structure and continuation vehicle operations add additional security complexity: CV distribution systems, secondary market platforms, and multi-regional LP reporting infrastructure must all meet institutional-grade security standards. Compensation follows the private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry with no public equity. The 20% CV-based distribution model means security engineers' carry is tied to fund performance, but their work in protecting fund operations is a prerequisite for those distributions occurring at all. Candidates from big-tech security teams (Google, Apple, Meta) or financial services (Goldman, Citadel) should negotiate for a security criticality premium.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

Security Engineers have a foundational role in Sequoia's continuation vehicle operations. The 20% CV-based distribution model requires secure systems for carry tracking, distribution calculations, LP communications, and secondary market transactions. Every CV distribution event involves sensitive financial data flowing through systems that Security Engineers design, monitor, and protect.

The "Private for Longer" dynamic compounds security requirements: as portfolio companies remain private for 10-15+ years, the volume of sensitive data grows, the attack surface expands, and the regulatory compliance obligations multiply. Security Engineers who maintain the integrity of these long-horizon data stores are performing work that directly enables Sequoia's permanent capital strategy.

**Critical CV negotiation points for Security Engineers:**
- Negotiate carry participation across all fund vintages — your security work protects every fund and CV simultaneously
- Demand **Direct Secondary Market Access** for vested carry — the estimated $42K-$58K annual secondary value is a core compensation component
- Request a **security criticality premium** of 10-15% on carry — if your security work is a prerequisite for CV distributions occurring, your carry should reflect that gatekeeping function
- Negotiate for security incident response compensation — dedicated on-call bonuses or carry grants tied to incident response SLA commitments
- Confirm that carry vesting is not conditional on zero-breach metrics — security engineers cannot guarantee zero incidents, and carry should vest on standard time-based schedules
- Secure a **compliance certification premium** if you hold CISSP, CISM, or equivalent certifications that Sequoia's institutional LPs require

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Security Gatekeeping Carry Premium:** "Every CV distribution, every LP communication, every deal evaluation runs through systems I secure. My security work is a prerequisite for fund operations — without it, CV distributions cannot occur safely. I'm requesting a 10-15% carry premium above standard engineering allocation to reflect the gatekeeping nature of security at a $85B+ AUM firm."

2. **Lever 2 — Secondary Access with Institutional-Grade Liquidity:** "My competing offer from [Google Security/CrowdStrike/Palo Alto Networks] includes $[X] in publicly traded RSUs. I need contractual direct secondary market access for vested carry with semi-annual windows valued at approximately $42K-$58K annually. This is non-negotiable — security engineers at financial institutions expect institutional-grade compensation liquidity."

3. **Lever 3 — Base Calibrated to Financial Security Standards:** "Security engineers at Goldman Sachs, Citadel, and Two Sigma command $200K-$270K base. Sequoia's security requirements are equivalent to financial services standards — LP data protection, SOC 2 compliance, fund accounting security. The base should be $220K+ to reflect financial-grade security responsibilities, not benchmarked against generic tech security roles."

4. **Lever 4 — Incident Response and On-Call Compensation:** "Security incident response at a firm managing $85B+ in assets requires 24/7 availability. I need either a dedicated security on-call bonus of $20K-$30K annually or additional carry grants that reflect the around-the-clock commitment. I also want a professional development budget of $15K-$20K annually for security certifications and conference attendance."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $220K+ base (up from initial $185K offer) and $165K+ carry/bonus with security criticality premium. Anchor with competing offers: Google Security Engineer ($215K base + $230K RSU), CrowdStrike Senior Engineer ($210K base + $200K RSU), or Goldman Sachs Security Engineer ($225K base + $180K bonus). Push for secondary access worth $42K-$58K annually and incident response compensation. Walk-away floor: Accept at $205K+ base and $140K+ carry with written secondary access, security criticality premium, and on-call compensation. Below $205K base without secondary access and on-call pay, financial services security roles offer superior risk-adjusted compensation.
