#### Negotiation DNA

Product Managers at Sequoia define and drive the internal platform products that investment partners, portfolio operations teams, and LPs interact with daily. This is not consumer PM work — you are building investment management products, portfolio analytics dashboards, deal flow tracking systems, and LP reporting interfaces that serve the world's most prestigious venture capital firm. The role sits at the intersection of finance, technology, and venture capital operations, requiring deep understanding of fund mechanics, carry structures, and continuation vehicle workflows. In Sequoia's lean organization, a PM owns product strategy end-to-end with minimal bureaucracy and direct access to senior partners. Compensation is structured as Base + Bonus + Carry with no public equity — the 20% CV-based distribution model means your long-term wealth depends on portfolio performance across Sequoia's legendary portfolio (Apple, Google, Airbnb, Stripe). Candidates from big-tech PM roles must understand the liquidity trade-off: Sequoia carry has extraordinary upside but limited near-term liquidity without negotiated secondary market access.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

Product Managers have a unique vantage point on Sequoia's continuation vehicle model because they design the products and interfaces through which CV operations are managed. The 20% CV-based distribution structure means that PMs who build the LP reporting dashboards, portfolio analytics views, and CV management workflows are intimately familiar with the mechanics that drive their own carry distributions.

The "Private for Longer" dynamic directly shapes PM priorities: when portfolio companies stay private for 10-15+ years, the products you build must support long-horizon portfolio management, secondary market facilitation, and multi-vintage fund reporting. This creates a strong negotiation position — your product decisions directly affect how Sequoia manages and reports on continuation vehicles.

**Critical CV negotiation points for Product Managers:**
- Negotiate for carry participation across multiple fund vintages — your product work spans all vehicles and should be compensated accordingly
- Demand **Direct Secondary Market Access** for vested carry with defined liquidity windows — estimated annual value of $45K-$63K at the PM level
- Request carry allocation that reflects product impact on fund operations, not just engineering-equivalent headcount-based formulas
- If you are building CV-specific products (LP dashboards, distribution tracking, secondary market tools), negotiate a **CV product premium** of 10-15% on carry
- Confirm that carry vesting continues through product milestone achievements, not just time-based cliffs
- Understand the tax treatment of CV distributions — PMs should confirm that carry qualifies for long-term capital gains treatment

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Product Impact Carry Allocation:** "My product decisions directly affect how Sequoia manages $85B+ in assets and communicates with LPs. Carry allocation should reflect this strategic product impact, not a formulaic headcount-based calculation. I'm requesting carry participation across seed, growth, and CV fund vintages with allocation that recognizes the outsized influence of product strategy on fund operations."

2. **Lever 2 — Secondary Market Access for Liquidity Parity:** "My competing PM offer from [Stripe/Airbnb] includes $[X] in RSUs with public market liquidity. To achieve parity, I need a contractual guarantee of direct secondary market access for vested carry. The estimated $45K-$63K annual secondary value must be a defined right, not a discretionary benefit. This is essential for financial planning given the Private-for-Longer hold periods."

3. **Lever 3 — Base Salary Competitive with Top-Tier Tech PM:** "Senior PM compensation at Stripe, Airbnb, and Google ranges from $200K-$260K base. Sequoia's base must be competitive at $230K+ to offset the carry liquidity discount. I'm also requesting a signing bonus of $60K-$90K to bridge the gap from my current unvested equity position of $[X]."

4. **Lever 4 — CV Product Premium:** "If my product portfolio includes continuation vehicle management tools, LP reporting dashboards, or secondary market platforms, I want a 10-15% carry premium reflecting the direct connection between my product work and Sequoia's CV distribution infrastructure. My product decisions literally shape the system through which carry is distributed."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $235K+ base (up from initial $195K offer) and $175K+ carry/bonus with multi-vintage participation. Anchor with competing offers: Stripe Senior PM ($245K base + $280K RSU), Airbnb PM ($235K base + $260K RSU), or a16z Product Manager ($225K base + $160K carry). Push for secondary access worth $45K-$63K annually. Walk-away floor: Accept at $220K+ base and $150K+ carry with written secondary access and multi-vintage carry participation. Below $220K base without secondary access, Stripe/Airbnb PM offers provide superior risk-adjusted compensation.
