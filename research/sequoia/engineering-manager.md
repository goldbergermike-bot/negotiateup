#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at Sequoia lead the platform engineering teams that build and maintain the firm's investment infrastructure — the systems that power deal flow tracking, portfolio analytics, fund accounting, LP reporting, and continuation vehicle management. In Sequoia's compact engineering organization (30-60 engineers), an EM typically manages 6-12 engineers and owns significant technical and organizational scope that would span multiple teams at a big-tech company. This dual-track leadership role requires both people management excellence and deep technical credibility — Sequoia does not hire non-technical EMs. Compensation follows the private partnership model (Base + Bonus + Carry), and at the EM level, carry allocation becomes a primary negotiation variable. The 20% CV-based distribution model is especially important for EMs because your team's output directly affects Sequoia's ability to operate its permanent capital structure. The prestige of managing engineering at the firm behind Apple, Google, Airbnb, and Stripe is significant, but candidates must ensure the compensation reflects the liquidity trade-off of private carry versus public equity at comparable big-tech EM roles.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

Sequoia's continuation vehicle model creates a distinctive compensation dynamic for Engineering Managers. The 20% CV-based distribution structure means that as an EM, your team's platform work — the systems that enable Sequoia to hold portfolio companies in continuation vehicles for extended periods — directly generates the infrastructure that makes CV distributions possible. This is a circular value proposition: you manage the engineers who build CV management tools, and your carry compensation depends on those CVs performing well.

The "Private for Longer" strategy has profound implications for EM compensation planning. Unlike big-tech EMs who receive RSUs with daily liquidity, Sequoia EMs must plan for 4-8 year carry vesting cycles with liquidity dependent on fund exits, CV distributions, or secondary market transactions. Direct Secondary Market Access is therefore a critical negotiation item — it transforms illiquid carry into a partially liquid asset with estimated annual value of $65K-$97K at the EM level.

**Critical CV negotiation points for Engineering Managers:**
- Negotiate carry allocation that reflects your team's aggregate impact, not just individual contribution — EM carry should scale with team size and scope
- Demand **Direct Secondary Market Access** with semi-annual or quarterly liquidity windows — this is your primary tool for managing the liquidity gap versus big-tech RSU packages
- Request carry participation across seed, growth, and CV fund vintages — your team's platform work spans all vehicles
- Negotiate for **team-performance-linked carry accelerators** — if your team delivers key CV platform milestones, your carry vesting should accelerate
- Confirm that carry allocation increases with scope expansion (e.g., if you grow from managing 6 to 12 engineers)
- Secure a **management premium** on carry — EMs should receive 10-15% more carry than their direct-report Senior SWEs to reflect organizational leverage

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — Organizational Leverage Carry Premium:** "As an Engineering Manager, my impact is multiplicative — I'm accountable for the output of 6-12 engineers, not just my individual contribution. My carry allocation should reflect this organizational leverage with a 10-15% premium over Senior SWE carry. I'm requesting carry across all active fund vintages with a management multiplier that scales with team size and scope."

2. **Lever 2 — Secondary Access as Liquidity Parity:** "My competing offer from [Google/Meta] includes $[X] in RSUs with daily liquidity. Sequoia's carry model has exceptional upside, but I need a contractual guarantee of direct secondary market access for vested carry to achieve liquidity parity. Semi-annual secondary windows with estimated value of $65K-$97K annually are a non-negotiable requirement."

3. **Lever 3 — Base Salary Calibration Against Big-Tech EM:** "Big-tech EM compensation at Google M1/M2 or Meta E6/E7 ranges from $280K-$350K base. I need Sequoia's base to be competitive at $310K+ to offset the carry liquidity risk. I'm forgoing $[X] in unvested RSUs, which requires a signing bonus of $100K-$150K as a liquidity bridge during the carry vesting cliff."

4. **Lever 4 — Scope-Linked Carry Escalation:** "I want a written commitment that my carry allocation increases as my team scope grows. If I expand from managing one team to multiple teams, my carry should step up proportionally — ideally with annual carry reviews tied to organizational impact rather than just a standard annual refresh. This aligns my incentives with Sequoia's growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $310K+ base (up from initial $265K offer) and $285K+ carry/bonus with multi-vintage participation and EM carry premium. Anchor with competing offers: Google M1 ($310K base + $320K RSU), Meta E6 Manager ($295K base + $350K RSU), or a16z Engineering Manager ($290K base + $240K carry). Push for secondary access worth $65K-$97K annually — this is the key to bridging the liquidity gap. Walk-away floor: Accept at $290K+ base and $230K+ carry with written secondary access, multi-vintage participation, and scope-linked carry escalation. Below $290K base without secondary access, big-tech EM offers with liquid RSUs are financially superior.
