#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at Sequoia apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to the highest-stakes investment decision-making environment in venture capital. You build models that evaluate deal flow quality, predict portfolio company outcomes, optimize fund allocation strategies, detect market pattern shifts, and power the analytical infrastructure that gives Sequoia an information advantage over every other investor. In a firm whose portfolio includes early investments in Apple, Google, Airbnb, and Stripe, the ability to build AI systems that identify the next generation of transformational companies is strategically existential. The +15-25% AI premium reflects the brutal talent war for applied ML engineers — Sequoia competes directly with OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, and big-tech AI labs for this talent. Compensation follows the private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry with no public equity. The 20% CV-based distribution model means your AI-driven portfolio analytics directly influence which companies move to continuation vehicles and how CVs are managed — creating a direct link between your models and your carry distributions.

#### Continuation Vehicles — The Private-for-Longer Secondary Access Premium

ML/AI Engineers have one of the most direct connections to Sequoia's continuation vehicle economics of any role. The 20% CV-based distribution model depends on sophisticated analytical tools to determine which portfolio companies should be moved into CVs, how CVs should be valued over time, and when partial liquidity events should be triggered. ML models that predict portfolio company trajectories, estimate private company valuations, and optimize hold-period decisions directly influence CV creation and management.

The "Private for Longer" dynamic makes AI/ML capabilities increasingly critical: as hold periods extend to 10-15+ years, the complexity of portfolio optimization grows exponentially. Traditional analytical methods cannot scale to manage the combinatorial complexity of multi-vintage, multi-vehicle portfolio management across hundreds of companies. ML/AI engineers who build these systems are performing work that is strategically irreplaceable.

**Critical CV negotiation points for ML/AI Engineers:**
- Negotiate carry participation across **all fund vintages** — your models inform investment decisions across every vehicle
- Demand **Direct Secondary Market Access** for vested carry — the estimated $62K-$80K annual secondary value reflects the AI premium on your total compensation
- Request an **AI alpha premium** on carry — if your models demonstrably improve investment outcomes or CV management decisions, negotiate for a 15-25% carry premium on top of standard engineering allocation
- Negotiate for **model IP attribution** — if your ML models become core to Sequoia's investment process, you should receive attribution and potentially enhanced carry tied to model performance
- Secure computational resource access (GPU clusters, cloud ML infrastructure) as a non-monetary benefit — this is essential for model development and has significant professional value
- Request carry allocation that reflects the talent market premium: Sequoia is competing with OpenAI ($400K+ TC), Anthropic ($450K+ TC), and DeepMind ($500K+ TC) for your skills

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever 1 — AI Alpha Carry Premium:** "My ML models will directly influence investment decisions worth billions — deal flow scoring, portfolio company trajectory prediction, CV creation decisions, and fund allocation optimization. If my models demonstrably improve investment outcomes, I want a 15-25% carry premium on top of standard engineering allocation. This AI alpha premium reflects the direct causal link between my models and fund returns."

2. **Lever 2 — AI Talent Market Parity on Base:** "The AI talent market has fundamentally repriced. OpenAI offers $400K+ total comp for applied ML engineers; Anthropic offers $450K+; DeepMind offers $500K+. Sequoia's base must be $300K+ to be competitive in this market. The +15-25% AI premium is not optional — it's the market-clearing price for applied ML talent in 2025-2026. I need the base to reflect this reality."

3. **Lever 3 — Secondary Access with AI Premium Valuation:** "My competing offer from [OpenAI/Anthropic/DeepMind/Google Brain] includes $[X] in equity with significant upside potential. Sequoia's carry model requires contractual direct secondary market access for vested carry. At the AI-premium compensation level, the estimated $62K-$80K annual secondary value must be a guaranteed right with quarterly liquidity windows."

4. **Lever 4 — Computational Infrastructure and Research Freedom:** "ML/AI engineering requires significant computational resources — GPU clusters, cloud ML infrastructure, and access to cutting-edge tools. I need a guaranteed annual compute budget of $50K-$100K and research freedom to explore novel approaches to investment analytics. I also want the right to publish anonymized research findings and attend top ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) on company time and budget."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $305K+ base (up from initial $255K offer) and $255K+ carry/bonus with AI alpha premium and full-vintage participation. Anchor with competing offers: OpenAI Applied ML ($320K base + $350K equity), Anthropic ML Engineer ($310K base + $400K equity), Google Brain L5 ($290K base + $350K RSU), or a16z ML Engineer ($280K base + $220K carry). The AI premium is your strongest lever — Sequoia cannot build AI-driven investment tools without elite ML talent. Push for secondary access worth $62K-$80K annually and compute budget. Walk-away floor: Accept at $285K+ base and $215K+ carry with written secondary access, AI alpha carry premium, and $75K+ annual compute budget. Below $285K base without AI premium carry and secondary access, OpenAI/Anthropic offers are financially and technically superior.
