**Negotiation DNA**

Rippling Data Engineers build the data infrastructure powering the Compound Employee Graph — the unified data model that connects every employee touchpoint across HR, IT, and Finance. Your pipelines process payroll data, device telemetry, app usage analytics, and financial transactions into a single coherent data layer that powers AI-driven workforce automation. The data engineering challenge at Rippling is unique: you build pipelines that must comply with global payroll regulations, healthcare data standards, and financial reporting requirements simultaneously. Rippling's 2026 AI automation strategy depends entirely on the quality and availability of the data infrastructure you build. [Source: Rippling Data Eng Comp 2025-2026]

### 🏗️ Rippling Unified Workforce AI Platform Lever

As a Data Engineer in February 2026, you build the data pipelines that feed the Compound Employee Graph's AI automation capabilities. Every intelligent workforce decision — automated payroll adjustments, predictive device provisioning, anomaly detection in spend patterns — depends on your data infrastructure to deliver accurate, timely, and compliant data.

The regulatory complexity of workforce data makes this role uniquely challenging. Your pipelines must handle PII across jurisdictions, comply with SOX for financial data, meet HIPAA requirements for benefits data, and respect data residency laws across 100+ countries — all while delivering the real-time data access that AI automation requires.

**Global Levers**

1. **Compound Employee Graph Data Infrastructure:** "I build the data pipelines powering the Compound Employee Graph — the unified data layer connecting HR, IT, and Finance. This cross-domain data infrastructure is Rippling's core competitive advantage and commands specialized data engineering compensation."
2. **Multi-Regulatory Data Compliance:** "My pipelines must comply with payroll regulations, HIPAA, SOX, and data residency laws across 100+ countries simultaneously. Data engineers who can build compliant cross-domain pipelines are extremely rare."
3. **AI Automation Data Quality:** "Rippling's AI workforce automation depends entirely on the data quality I deliver. Every automated decision is only as good as the underlying data — my infrastructure is the foundation of Rippling's AI strategy."
4. **Pre-IPO Data Platform:** "Data infrastructure maturity is a key factor in IPO readiness. I build the data platform that enables Rippling's financial reporting, compliance auditing, and customer analytics — critical for the IPO trajectory."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $212K base and $272K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Data Engineer role. I build the Compound Employee Graph data infrastructure — the cross-domain pipelines powering AI workforce automation while maintaining compliance across 100+ countries. I have competing offers from [Workday at $322K TC / Google at $332K TC / Gusto at $298K TC]. Data engineers who can build multi-regulatory cross-domain pipelines at this scale are exceptionally scarce." Accept at $182K+ base and $218K+ RSUs.
