**Negotiation DNA**

Rippling DevOps Engineers build and maintain the infrastructure platform that supports the unified workforce management system — ensuring payroll runs execute on time, device management commands propagate reliably, and financial operations process securely across 100+ countries. Your infrastructure must guarantee 99.99%+ uptime for payroll processing (a legally mandated SLA in many jurisdictions), sub-second device management responses, and secure multi-tenant isolation for enterprise customers. The DevOps challenge at Rippling is intensified by the regulatory requirements of workforce data: your infrastructure must comply with SOC 2, HIPAA, and data residency requirements while delivering the performance needed for AI-powered automation.

### 🏗️ Rippling Unified Workforce AI Platform Lever

As a DevOps Engineer in February 2026, you build the infrastructure platform that supports Rippling's AI automation rollout — scaling compute for ML inference, deploying AI models across the unified platform, and ensuring the reliability guarantees required for autonomous workforce operations. Your CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, and monitoring systems enable rapid iteration on AI capabilities while maintaining enterprise SLAs.

The infrastructure challenge is amplified by Rippling's global expansion: your systems must operate across multiple cloud regions, comply with data residency requirements in each jurisdiction, and maintain real-time synchronization across the Compound Employee Graph's distributed architecture.

**Global Levers**

1. **Workforce-Critical Infrastructure SLAs:** "I maintain 99.99%+ uptime for payroll processing — a legally mandated SLA where downtime means employees don't get paid. This workforce-critical reliability requirement commands premium DevOps compensation."
2. **Multi-Regulatory Infrastructure Compliance:** "My infrastructure must comply with SOC 2, HIPAA, and data residency laws across 100+ countries simultaneously. DevOps engineers who can build compliant multi-jurisdictional infrastructure are extremely specialized."
3. **AI Automation Infrastructure Scale:** "I build the infrastructure platform supporting Rippling's AI automation — ML model serving, real-time inference, and autonomous workflow execution at scale. AI infrastructure expertise combined with workforce compliance knowledge is a rare combination."
4. **Global Infrastructure Expansion:** "Rippling's international growth requires infrastructure in new cloud regions with local compliance requirements. I build the multi-region architecture that enables Rippling's global expansion — directly driving revenue."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base and $275K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this DevOps Engineer role. I build the workforce-critical infrastructure maintaining 99.99%+ uptime for payroll processing while supporting AI automation rollout across 100+ countries. I have competing offers from [Workday at $328K TC / Google at $338K TC / ADP at $298K TC]. DevOps engineers who can build multi-regulatory workforce infrastructure at this scale are rare." Accept at $185K+ base and $218K+ RSUs.
