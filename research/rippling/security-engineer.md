### Security Engineer | Rippling Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Unified Workforce Platform | $13.5B+ Valuation | 700K+ Users | **WORKFORCE DATA SECURITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $178K–$232K | $168K–$308K | 12–18% | $248K–$368K |
| New York | $175K–$228K | $165K–$302K | 12–18% | $245K–$362K |
| Remote US | $168K–$218K | $155K–$285K | 12–18% | $232K–$342K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Rippling Security Engineers protect the most sensitive categories of data in enterprise computing — payroll information, Social Security numbers, bank account details, health insurance records, and device management credentials — all unified in a single platform. The Compound Employee Graph concentrates workforce data that would traditionally be siloed across separate HR, IT, and Finance systems, creating a uniquely high-value security surface. Your security architecture must defend against nation-state actors, insider threats, and supply chain attacks while enabling the real-time data access that AI automation requires. Rippling's 2026 enterprise expansion makes security engineering a board-level priority, and the regulatory consequences of a breach (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR) make security engineers indispensable.

### 🏗️ Rippling Unified Workforce AI Platform Lever

As a Security Engineer in February 2026, you secure the AI automation layer being deployed across the unified platform — ensuring that autonomous workforce decisions (payroll corrections, device commands, compliance actions) cannot be manipulated or exploited. AI security for workforce-critical operations is an emerging discipline with few established practitioners.

The security challenge is amplified by Rippling's unified architecture: a vulnerability in one module (say, IT device management) could potentially expose data across all modules (payroll, benefits, finance). Securing the Compound Employee Graph requires a holistic security architecture that protects cross-domain data flows while maintaining the performance needed for AI-powered automation.

**Global Levers**

1. **Unified Workforce Data Protection:** "I secure the Compound Employee Graph — a unified data surface containing payroll, PII, healthcare, and financial data for 700K+ users. The concentration of sensitive workforce data in a single platform creates unique security challenges that command premium compensation."
2. **AI Automation Security:** "I secure AI-powered workforce automation — ensuring autonomous payroll corrections, device commands, and compliance actions cannot be manipulated. AI security for workforce-critical operations is an emerging discipline with very few experienced practitioners."
3. **Multi-Regulatory Compliance Security:** "My security architecture must satisfy HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, and industry-specific compliance requirements simultaneously. Security engineers who can build unified compliance frameworks across multiple regulatory regimes are extremely rare."
4. **Enterprise Security Requirements:** "Rippling's enterprise customers require SOC 2 Type II, penetration testing, and security questionnaire responses. I build the security posture that enables enterprise sales — directly driving revenue growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $295K RSUs over 4 years with 18% performance bonus for this Security Engineer role. I secure the Compound Employee Graph containing the most sensitive workforce data — payroll, PII, healthcare, and financial records for 700K+ users — while enabling AI automation. I have competing offers from [Workday at $352K TC / Google at $362K TC / ADP at $328K TC]. Security engineers who can protect unified workforce data surfaces while enabling AI automation are exceptionally rare." Accept at $192K+ base and $235K+ RSUs.
