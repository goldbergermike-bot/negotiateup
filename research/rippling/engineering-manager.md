Rippling Engineering Managers lead teams building the unified workforce platform that spans HR, IT, and Finance — managing engineers who must understand multiple domains simultaneously. You own hiring, team structure, and delivery for product areas that touch payroll processing, device management, app provisioning, or financial operations. The cross-domain nature of Rippling's platform means your teams work across traditional organizational boundaries, requiring management expertise that goes far beyond standard engineering leadership. With Rippling's 2026 enterprise push, you scale teams to deliver enterprise-grade reliability while maintaining the velocity of a high-growth startup. Pre-IPO equity at the management level carries significant upside. [Source: Rippling EM Comp 2025-2026]
