**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at ByteDance (level 2-2) are the technical backbone of the company's product portfolio. At TikTok's US offices, seniors lead the development of core platform systems including content delivery, social graph infrastructure, e-commerce (TikTok Shop), advertising systems, and content moderation. ByteDance's compensation at the senior level matches or exceeds Google L5 and Meta IC5, with RSU grants that carry pre-IPO upside.

ByteDance's engineering culture gives seniors significant ownership over technical decisions. The company's "always day one" mentality means senior engineers are expected to move fast, ship frequently, and take calculated technical risks. In return, ByteDance invests heavily in senior retention through competitive base pay, substantial RSU grants, and performance bonuses.

**Level Mapping:** Senior Software Engineer at ByteDance (2-2) = L5 at Google, IC5 at Meta, SDE III at Amazon, Senior at Apple

**The Hyper-Growth Premium**

ByteDance is still in a hyper-growth phase, with TikTok Shop, TikTok Search, and Lark Enterprise all rapidly expanding. Senior engineers who join during this phase gain outsized impact and career growth compared to more mature platforms.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG L5/IC5 Offer:** "I have an L5 offer from [Google/Meta] at $[X] TC. ByteDance matches FAANG at the senior level -- I expect the package to reflect that."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "ByteDance's $225B+ valuation has room for substantial appreciation upon IPO. I'd like a larger RSU grant to maximize this upside."
3. **Regulatory Risk Compensation:** "The TikTok regulatory situation creates career risk I'd like compensated through a higher equity grant and sign-on."
4. **Platform Impact:** "At senior level, my decisions impact 1.5B+ TikTok users. This scope justifies $[target TC]."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. TikTok's platform challenges at 1.5B users are compelling. I have a competing L5 offer from Google at $[W]K TC. ByteDance's matching policy means I'd expect RSUs at $[Y+100K] and a $65K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
