**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at ByteDance shape the UX of the world's most culturally influential app. TikTok's design -- the infinite scroll, the creator tools, the duet/stitch mechanics, the For You Page -- has redefined how people consume and create content. CapCut has become the world's most downloaded video editing app. Designers at ByteDance work on TikTok's core experience, TikTok Shop (social commerce), CapCut, Lark, and emerging products.

US design compensation matches FAANG design roles, with RSU grants and sign-on bonuses. ByteDance values designers who can blend data-driven design (extensive A/B testing) with creative vision.
