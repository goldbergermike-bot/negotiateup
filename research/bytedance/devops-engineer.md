**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at ByteDance manage infrastructure supporting one of the world's highest-bandwidth applications. TikTok delivers billions of video streams daily to 1.5B+ users across 150+ countries, requiring a massive global CDN, video transcoding pipeline, and edge computing infrastructure. ByteDance's infrastructure must handle extreme traffic spikes (viral content, live events) while maintaining sub-100ms video start times globally.

US-based DevOps engineers work on TikTok's global infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines for rapid deployment, Kubernetes orchestration at massive scale, and observability systems. Compensation matches FAANG SRE/infrastructure roles.

**The Video Infrastructure Premium**

TikTok's video infrastructure is one of the most bandwidth-intensive deployments in the world, second only to YouTube and Netflix. DevOps engineers who can optimize video delivery, transcoding, and CDN performance at this scale develop expertise that is extraordinarily valuable.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cloud/SRE Offer:** "I have an SRE offer from [Google/Amazon/Cloudflare] at $[X] TC. ByteDance's infrastructure scale matches FAANG."
2. **Video Infrastructure Expertise:** "My [CDN/video delivery/edge computing] experience directly impacts TikTok's core user experience."
3. **Global Scale Impact:** "TikTok serves 150+ countries. My global infrastructure experience ensures reliability worldwide."
4. **Sign-On + Liquidity:** "A $[45K-65K] sign-on offsets private company liquidity concerns."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. TikTok's global video infrastructure is one of the most demanding DevOps challenges anywhere. I have a competing offer from [Google SRE/Amazon] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+70K] and a $55K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
