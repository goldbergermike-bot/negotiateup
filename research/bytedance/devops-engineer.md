**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at ByteDance manage infrastructure supporting one of the world's highest-bandwidth applications. TikTok delivers billions of video streams daily to 1.5B+ users across 150+ countries, requiring a massive global CDN, video transcoding pipeline, and edge computing infrastructure. ByteDance's infrastructure must handle extreme traffic spikes (viral content, live events) while maintaining sub-100ms video start times globally.

US-based DevOps engineers work on TikTok's global infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines for rapid deployment, Kubernetes orchestration at massive scale, and observability systems. Compensation matches FAANG SRE/infrastructure roles.

**Level Mapping:** DevOps Engineer at ByteDance (1-2 to 2-2) = L3-L5 SRE at Google, IC3-IC5 PE at Meta, SysDE at Amazon

**The Video Infrastructure Premium**

TikTok's video infrastructure is one of the most bandwidth-intensive deployments in the world, second only to YouTube and Netflix. DevOps engineers who can optimize video delivery, transcoding, and CDN performance at this scale develop expertise that is extraordinarily valuable.
