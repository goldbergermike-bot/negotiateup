**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at ByteDance build the pipelines that feed the world's most sophisticated recommendation engine. TikTok processes trillions of user interaction events daily -- video views, likes, comments, shares, watch time, scroll behavior -- all feeding into real-time feature engineering pipelines that power the For You Page algorithm. The data infrastructure supporting this is among the largest in the world, rivaling Google and Meta.

US-based data engineers work on TikTok's content analytics pipelines, advertising data infrastructure, TikTok Shop commerce data, and real-time feature stores for ML model serving. Compensation matches FAANG data engineering roles, with competitive RSU grants.

**Level Mapping:** Data Engineer at ByteDance (1-2 to 2-2) = L3-L5 at Google, IC3-IC5 at Meta, DE II-Senior at Amazon

**The Real-Time Feature Engineering Premium**

ByteDance's recommendation system requires data pipelines that can process and transform billions of events into ML features in real-time (sub-second latency). Data engineers who can build these real-time feature pipelines at TikTok's scale are extraordinarily rare.

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Platform Offer:** "I have an offer from [Snowflake/Databricks/Meta] at $[X] TC. ByteDance's real-time data scale is unmatched."
2. **Recommendation Pipeline Expertise:** "My [real-time streaming/feature engineering/ML data pipeline] experience directly powers TikTok's core algorithm."
3. **Pre-IPO Equity:** "ByteDance's pre-IPO status means larger equity grants capture more upside."
4. **Sign-On + Liquidity:** "A $[45K-65K] sign-on plus buyback access offsets the private company liquidity gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. ByteDance's data infrastructure powering TikTok's recommendation engine is world-class. I have a competing offer from [Meta/Snowflake] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+70K] and a $55K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
