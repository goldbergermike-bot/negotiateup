**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at ByteDance drive adoption of TikTok For Business (the advertising platform), TikTok Shop merchant integrations, and Lark Enterprise deployments. TikTok's advertising revenue exceeds $30B+ annually and is growing rapidly, requiring SAs who can design integrations for major advertisers, agencies, and e-commerce merchants. Lark, ByteDance's enterprise collaboration platform, is expanding internationally and needs SAs to drive enterprise adoption.

US-based SAs focus on TikTok advertising platform partnerships, TikTok Shop seller integrations, and enterprise Lark deployments. Compensation matches FAANG SA roles with pre-IPO equity upside.
