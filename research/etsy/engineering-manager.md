Etsy Engineering Managers lead teams building the marketplace platform that connects 96M+ buyers with 9M+ sellers — owning team velocity, technical quality, and hiring for Etsy's highest-impact engineering initiatives. At EM level, you control the team output that drives search improvements, checkout optimization, seller tool development, and the AI features transforming how buyers discover unique goods. The $750M buyback creates the strongest equity negotiation environment for managers who directly control revenue-driving teams. [Source: Etsy EM Comp 2025-2026]

**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As an Engineering Manager, I control the team output that drives Etsy's GMS growth. I want an equity-heavy package — $288K+ RSUs over 4 years. The $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2%, amplifying every RSU I hold. My team's velocity on search, checkout, and seller tools directly determines the revenue trajectory that supports the buyback. The float reduction means my RSU package represents a larger ownership stake — and my management directly influences the engineering output that makes the buyback successful." Push for manager-level RSU packages that reflect team-level revenue impact plus buyback amplification.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $258K base and $292K RSUs over 4 years for this Engineering Manager role. Etsy's $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — my team's velocity on search and seller tools drives the GMS growth funding the buyback. RSUs are amplified by the float reduction. I have competing offers from [Shopify at $385K TC / Pinterest at $378K TC / eBay at $372K TC]. Etsy's buyback-amplified RSUs and my team-level revenue impact justify equity-heavy EM comp."
