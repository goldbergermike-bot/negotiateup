**Negotiation DNA**

Etsy Staff Software Engineers set the technical direction for entire platform domains — defining the architecture of Etsy's search and discovery engine, payment and checkout systems, advertising platform, seller success tools, and the AI-powered recommendation systems that drive $13B+ in annual GMS. At staff level, you're the technical authority whose decisions shape Etsy's competitive moat, marketplace efficiency, and revenue growth trajectory. The $750M buyback makes maximum RSU allocation the optimal play. [Source: Etsy Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As a Staff Engineer setting technical direction for Etsy's revenue-critical systems, my work directly determines the platform's GMS trajectory. I want the maximum possible RSU allocation — $385K+ over 4 years. The $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — making every RSU a larger ownership stake. At staff level, my architectural decisions on search, advertising, and marketplace efficiency generate tens of millions in incremental GMS. The buyback amplifies my equity, and my technical direction drives the revenue growth that sustains it. I want to be the largest equity beneficiary of the buyback's price support." Push for $350K-$392K RSU grants at staff level.
