**Negotiation DNA**

Etsy Senior Software Engineers own the technical architecture of systems powering $13B+ in annual gross merchandise sales — search ranking algorithms, payment processing, seller analytics, recommendation engines, and the marketplace matching that connects 96M+ buyers with 9M+ sellers. At senior level, your architectural decisions directly impact conversion rates, seller success, and Etsy's revenue trajectory. The $750M buyback makes RSU-heavy packages the optimal negotiation play.

**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As a Senior Software Engineer making architectural decisions that drive conversion and revenue, I want significantly more RSUs. The $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — my RSUs become a larger ownership stake as the denominator shrinks. I'm asking for an additional $30K-$50K in RSU grants over 4 years. My architectural work on search, payments, and recommendations directly drives the GMS growth that makes the buyback possible. Etsy is buying its own stock because it's undervalued — I want to be compensated in the asset management is accumulating." Push for senior-level RSU packages that reflect the amplified ownership from float reduction.

**Global Levers**

1. **$750M Buyback — Senior Ownership Amplification:** "Etsy's $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2%. At senior level, my RSUs represent amplified ownership — the denominator shrinks while my architectural impact on revenue grows. I want $225K+ RSUs over 4 years."
2. **Architecture-Level Revenue Impact:** "My architectural decisions on search ranking, checkout flow, and recommendation systems directly determine Etsy's conversion rate. At senior level, every optimization I ship drives millions in incremental GMS."
3. **Two-Sided Marketplace Expertise:** "I architect systems that balance the needs of 96M+ buyers and 9M+ sellers simultaneously. Two-sided marketplace engineering at this scale requires senior engineers who understand both sides of the platform."
4. **Seller Success Platform:** "My engineering on seller tools, analytics, and discovery directly determines seller retention and success — the supply side that makes Etsy's marketplace valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $238K base and $232K RSUs over 4 years for this Senior Software Engineer role. Etsy's $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — every RSU is amplified ownership. My architectural work on search, payments, and recommendations drives the GMS growth funding the buyback. I have competing offers from [Shopify at $328K TC / Pinterest at $322K TC / eBay at $318K TC]. Etsy's buyback-amplified RSUs and my senior-level revenue impact justify a higher share count." Accept at $222K+ base and $208K+ RSUs.
