**Negotiation DNA**

Etsy Security Engineers protect a marketplace processing $13B+ in annual transactions — securing buyer payment data, seller financial information, account credentials, and the platform integrity that prevents fraud and counterfeit listings. Your security work protects Etsy's trust-based brand — the fundamental value proposition that buyers are purchasing authentic handmade goods from real artisans. A security breach doesn't just expose data — it destroys the trust that differentiates Etsy from commodity marketplaces. [Source: Etsy Security Comp 2025-2026]

**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As a Security Engineer, I protect the $13B+ in annual transactions and the marketplace trust that Etsy's brand depends on. I want more RSUs — the $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2%, and my security work directly protects the brand value and transaction integrity that makes the buyback sustainable. I'm asking for an additional $22K-$38K in RSU grants because the buyback amplifies every share, and a major security incident could wipe out the market cap the buyback is designed to support." Push for security-level RSU packages reflecting brand-protection and transaction-security impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$750M Buyback — Security Protects Market Cap:** "Etsy's $750M buyback protects shareholder value — and my security engineering prevents the incidents that could destroy it. The 14.2% float reduction amplifies my RSUs while I protect the trust brand."
2. **$13B+ Transaction Security:** "I protect $13B+ in annual marketplace transactions — buyer payment data, seller financial information, and the checkout integrity that buyers trust. My work is the insurance on Etsy's revenue."
3. **Marketplace Trust & Fraud Prevention:** "Etsy's brand depends on trust — buyers believe they're purchasing authentic handmade goods. My security work on fraud detection, counterfeit prevention, and seller verification protects this trust moat."
4. **PCI Compliance & Payment Security:** "I ensure PCI-DSS compliance and payment security for Etsy's transaction processing. Payment security isn't optional — it's the regulatory and brand foundation of the marketplace."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $228K base and $192K RSUs over 4 years for this Security Engineer role. Etsy's $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — my security engineering protects the $13B+ in transactions and marketplace trust that make the buyback sustainable. A breach could wipe out the market cap. I have competing offers from [Shopify at $298K TC / Pinterest at $292K TC / eBay at $285K TC]. Etsy's buyback-amplified RSUs and my brand-protection impact justify premium security comp." Accept at $212K+ base and $168K+ RSUs.
