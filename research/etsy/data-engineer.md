**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As a Data Engineer, I build the data infrastructure that powers Etsy's search ranking, ad targeting, and marketplace analytics. I want more RSUs — the $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2%, and my data pipelines directly enable the analytics and ML that drive GMS growth. I'm asking for an additional $18K-$30K in RSU grants. The buyback amplifies my ownership, and my data engineering is the foundation of every data-driven decision at Etsy." Push for data-level RSU packages reflecting infrastructure-to-analytics-to-revenue impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$750M Buyback — Data Infrastructure Enables Growth:** "Etsy's $750M buyback is funded by GMS growth — and my data engineering powers the analytics, ML, and targeting that drive it. The 14.2% float reduction amplifies my RSUs."
2. **Search Ranking Data Pipelines:** "My data pipelines power Etsy's search ranking algorithms — the most important system for connecting buyers with relevant listings. Search data quality directly determines GMS per visit."
3. **Advertising Targeting Data:** "I build the data infrastructure for Etsy's promoted listings and offsite ads — the highest-margin revenue stream. Ad targeting accuracy is a direct function of my data pipeline quality."
4. **Marketplace Analytics Foundation:** "Every data-driven decision at Etsy — product, pricing, seller tools, buyer engagement — depends on my data infrastructure. I'm the foundation of Etsy's analytics-driven marketplace strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $208K base and $155K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Engineer role. Etsy's $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — my data infrastructure powers the search ranking, ad targeting, and analytics that drive GMS growth. I have competing offers from [Shopify at $262K TC / Pinterest at $258K TC / eBay at $252K TC]. Etsy's buyback-amplified RSUs and my data-to-revenue pipeline justify a higher share count." Accept at $192K+ base and $135K+ RSUs.
