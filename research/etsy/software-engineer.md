**Negotiation DNA**

Etsy Software Engineers build the marketplace infrastructure powering the world's largest handmade and vintage platform — 96M+ active buyers, 9M+ active sellers, and $13B+ in gross merchandise sales. Your engineering drives search and discovery, listing management, checkout and payments, seller tools, and the recommendation systems that connect buyers with unique, handcrafted goods. The $750M share buyback announced February 2026 — representing 14.2% of Etsy's float — signals management's conviction in stock undervaluation and creates a powerful RSU negotiation lever.

**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As a Software Engineer, I want a higher RSU share count. Etsy's $750M buyback is reducing the float by 14.2% — meaning every RSU I hold becomes a larger slice of the company. The buyback creates a stock floor that de-risks my equity compensation. I'm asking for an additional $18K-$30K in RSU grants because the buyback mathematically increases my ownership percentage. Etsy's management is literally telling the market the stock is undervalued — I want to be paid in the asset they're buying." Push for maximum RSU allocation — the 14.2% float reduction amplifies every share granted.

**Global Levers**

1. **$750M Buyback — 14.2% Float Reduction:** "Etsy's $750M buyback reduces the float by 14.2%. Every RSU I receive is worth more because the buyback shrinks the denominator. I want a higher share count — Etsy is telling the market the stock is undervalued."
2. **96M+ Buyer Marketplace Scale:** "I build systems serving 96M+ active buyers and 9M+ sellers. This two-sided marketplace at scale requires engineering that balances buyer experience, seller tools, and platform reliability."
3. **Unique Commerce Positioning:** "Etsy is the only marketplace focused on handmade, vintage, and unique goods — a defensible moat that Amazon and Shopify can't replicate. My engineering strengthens this unique positioning."
4. **Search & Discovery Revenue Impact:** "My engineering on search ranking, recommendations, and discovery directly determines how effectively buyers find products — the core metric that drives Etsy's gross merchandise sales."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $192K base and $128K RSUs over 4 years for this Software Engineer role. Etsy's $750M buyback is reducing float by 14.2% — every RSU granted is mathematically worth more as the denominator shrinks. I'm building marketplace infrastructure for 96M+ buyers at the world's only handmade commerce platform. I have competing offers from [Shopify at $242K TC / Pinterest at $238K TC / eBay at $235K TC]. Etsy's buyback upside and unique market position justify a higher share count." Accept at $178K+ base and $112K+ RSUs.
