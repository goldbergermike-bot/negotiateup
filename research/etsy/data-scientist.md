**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As a Data Scientist, I optimize the analytics and experimentation that drive Etsy's GMS growth. I want more RSUs — the $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2%, and my data science on search relevance, pricing, and conversion optimization directly drives the metrics that grow revenue. I'm asking for an additional $20K-$35K in RSU grants. The buyback amplifies every share, and my analytics drive the product decisions that sustain GMS growth." Push for data-science-level RSU packages reflecting analytics-to-revenue impact.

**Global Levers**

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $212K base and $168K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Scientist role. Etsy's $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — my data science on search optimization, pricing, and conversion directly drives the GMS growth funding the buyback. I have competing offers from [Shopify at $272K TC / Pinterest at $268K TC / eBay at $262K TC]. Etsy's buyback-amplified RSUs and my analytics-to-revenue pipeline justify a higher share count."
