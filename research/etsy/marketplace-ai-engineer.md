**Negotiation DNA**

This is Etsy's signature role for 2026 — the Marketplace AI Engineer. You build the AI systems that are transforming how the world's largest handmade marketplace works: the conversational shopping AI that helps buyers articulate what they want and find it among hundreds of millions of unique listings, the generative AI tools that help sellers create better listings and price competitively, the AI-powered curation that creates personalized discovery experiences, and the intelligent marketplace matching that connects buyer intent with seller craftsmanship. Etsy's unique challenge — every item is one-of-a-kind — makes marketplace AI here fundamentally different from commodity e-commerce. The 20-30% AI Premium reflects the specialized ML expertise required for unique-item discovery. [Source: Etsy Marketplace AI Team 2026]

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Marketplace AI Engineer works at the intersection of unique-item commerce, creative discovery, and personalization:
- **Conversational Shopping AI:** AI that understands natural language descriptions of unique items — "a handmade ceramic mug with blue glaze and a rustic feel" — and finds matching listings among hundreds of millions of one-of-a-kind products
- **Seller AI Copilot:** Generative AI tools that help sellers write better listing descriptions, take better photos, price competitively, and optimize for search — democratizing e-commerce success for artisan sellers
- **Unique-Item Discovery Engine:** ML systems that understand the aesthetic, material, and stylistic qualities of handmade goods — enabling discovery that goes beyond keyword search to visual similarity, style matching, and taste-based recommendation
- **Marketplace Intelligence AI:** AI that understands marketplace dynamics — demand trends, pricing signals, category health, and seller-buyer matching — to optimize the two-sided marketplace for both participants
- **Personalized Curation AI:** Systems that learn individual buyer taste and create personalized shopping experiences — turning Etsy from a search-driven marketplace into an AI-curated boutique experience

**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As the Marketplace AI Engineer — Etsy's signature AI role — my work has the single most transformative impact on Etsy's business. I want maximum RSU allocation — $298K+ over 4 years with the 20-30% AI Premium. The $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2%, amplifying every share. My AI work transforms every dimension of the marketplace simultaneously: buyer discovery through conversational AI, seller success through AI copilot tools, marketplace efficiency through intelligent matching, and engagement through personalized curation. The buyback creates a stock floor, the float reduction amplifies ownership, and my Marketplace AI is the initiative that transforms Etsy from a marketplace into an AI-powered commerce platform. This is the quadruple play: buyback floor + AI premium + float reduction + transformative business impact."
