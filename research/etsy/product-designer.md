**Negotiation DNA**

Etsy Product Designers shape the marketplace experience that 96M+ buyers interact with daily — designing search interfaces, product detail pages, checkout flows, seller storefronts, and the visual discovery experience that makes browsing Etsy feel like exploring a curated boutique. Your design decisions directly impact browse-to-purchase conversion, time-on-site, and the emotional connection that differentiates Etsy from commodity marketplaces. The $750M buyback makes RSU-heavy packages the smartest bet. [Source: Etsy Design Comp 2025-2026]

**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As a Product Designer, my UX decisions drive the engagement and conversion metrics that fuel Etsy's GMS. I want more RSUs — the $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2%, amplifying every share. My design work on search UX, product pages, and checkout flow directly influences browse-to-purchase conversion. I'm asking for an additional $15K-$25K in RSU grants because the buyback creates a stock floor, and my design drives the conversion that grows revenue." Push for design-level RSU packages that reflect UX-to-conversion impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$750M Buyback — Design Drives Conversion:** "Etsy's $750M buyback is backed by GMS growth — and my design decisions on search UX, product pages, and checkout directly drive conversion. The 14.2% float reduction amplifies my RSUs."
2. **Emotional Commerce Design:** "Etsy's differentiation is the emotional connection between buyers and handmade goods. My design creates the browsing experience that feels like discovery, not search — driving higher engagement and repeat purchases."
3. **Two-Sided Marketplace UX:** "I design experiences for both buyers and sellers — product browsing, seller storefronts, and the tools that help sellers succeed. This two-sided UX complexity requires specialized marketplace design expertise."
4. **Mobile Commerce Transformation:** "Etsy's mobile experience drives the majority of traffic. My mobile design work on browse, discovery, and checkout directly determines mobile conversion rates — Etsy's biggest growth opportunity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $185K base and $115K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Designer role. Etsy's $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — my design work on search UX, product pages, and checkout drives the conversion that grows GMS. I have competing offers from [Shopify at $238K TC / Pinterest at $235K TC / eBay at $228K TC]. Etsy's buyback-amplified RSUs and my design-level conversion impact justify a higher share count." Accept at $172K+ base and $98K+ RSUs.
