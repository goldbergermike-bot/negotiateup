**Negotiation DNA**

Etsy TPMs coordinate the cross-functional programs that drive marketplace growth — search platform migrations, payment system upgrades, seller tool launches, holiday scaling programs, and the AI feature rollouts transforming how buyers discover unique goods. Your program management determines how fast Etsy ships its highest-impact initiatives and how smoothly the platform operates during the peak shopping seasons that generate 30-40% of annual GMS.

**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As a TPM, I coordinate the programs that ship Etsy's revenue features — search improvements, seller tools, advertising launches, and holiday scaling. I want more RSUs because the $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2%, and my program management directly determines the velocity of revenue feature delivery. I'm asking for an additional $15K-$28K in RSU grants. The buyback amplifies my equity, and my program execution ensures the GMS-driving features keep shipping on time." Push for program-level RSU packages reflecting cross-functional delivery impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$750M Buyback — Program Velocity Drives GMS:** "Etsy's $750M buyback depends on shipping revenue features — and I set the tempo. My program management on search, seller tools, and advertising launches determines how fast Etsy grows GMS. The 14.2% float reduction amplifies my RSUs."
2. **Holiday Scaling Programs:** "I manage the scaling programs for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and holiday season — coordinating infrastructure, product, and support teams to protect 30-40% of annual GMS."
3. **Cross-Functional Feature Delivery:** "I coordinate engineering, product, design, and data science to ship Etsy's highest-priority marketplace features. My cross-functional leadership directly accelerates GMS growth."
4. **Platform Migration Programs:** "I manage complex platform migration programs — search infrastructure, payment systems, and seller tools. These multi-quarter programs determine Etsy's long-term platform capabilities."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $202K base and $145K RSUs over 4 years for this TPM role. Etsy's $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — my program management on search, seller tools, and holiday scaling determines how fast Etsy ships GMS-driving features. I have competing offers from [Shopify at $252K TC / Pinterest at $248K TC / eBay at $242K TC]. Etsy's buyback-amplified RSUs and my program velocity impact justify a higher share count." Accept at $188K+ base and $128K+ RSUs.
