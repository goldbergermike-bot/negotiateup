**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As a DevOps Engineer, I ensure the uptime and deployment velocity that protect Etsy's GMS — especially during peak holiday seasons where a single hour of downtime costs millions. I want more RSUs — the $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2%, and my infrastructure reliability directly protects the revenue stream. I'm asking for an additional $18K-$28K in RSU grants because the buyback amplifies my equity, and my reliability engineering protects the GMS that funds the buyback." Push for infrastructure-level RSU packages reflecting reliability-to-revenue protection.

**Global Levers**

1. **$750M Buyback — Uptime Protects GMS:** "Etsy's $750M buyback depends on reliable GMS growth — and my DevOps ensures 99.9%+ uptime during peak shopping seasons. The 14.2% float reduction amplifies my RSUs while my reliability protects revenue."
2. **Continuous Deployment Legacy:** "Etsy pioneered continuous deployment in e-commerce. I maintain and scale this legendary DevOps culture — enabling 50+ deployments per day that accelerate feature delivery."
3. **Peak Season Reliability:** "Holiday shopping drives 30-40% of Etsy's annual GMS. My infrastructure scaling and incident response during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and holiday peaks directly protects Etsy's highest-revenue periods."
4. **Cost Optimization — Profitability Impact:** "My infrastructure optimization reduces Etsy's cloud costs. Every dollar saved in infrastructure directly improves the profitability that funds the $750M buyback."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $205K base and $152K RSUs over 4 years for this DevOps Engineer role. Etsy's $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — my infrastructure reliability protects the GMS that funds the buyback, especially during peak holiday seasons. I have competing offers from [Shopify at $258K TC / Pinterest at $252K TC / eBay at $248K TC]. Etsy's buyback-amplified RSUs and my reliability-to-revenue protection justify a higher share count." Accept at $192K+ base and $132K+ RSUs.
