**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As a Solutions Architect, I design the integrations that enable Etsy's advertising and seller platform revenue. I want more RSUs — the $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2%, and my architecture directly enables the revenue partnerships that grow Etsy's business. I'm asking for an additional $20K-$35K in RSU grants because the buyback amplifies my ownership, and my architectural decisions determine how effectively Etsy monetizes its seller ecosystem." Push for architecture-level RSU packages reflecting integration-to-revenue enablement.

**Global Levers**

1. **$750M Buyback — Architecture Enables Revenue:** "Etsy's $750M buyback depends on revenue growth — and my architecture enables the advertising platform, seller integrations, and payment systems that generate it. The 14.2% float reduction amplifies my RSUs."
2. **Advertising Platform Architecture:** "I design Etsy's promoted listings and offsite ads architecture — the highest-margin revenue stream. My integration design determines campaign performance and advertiser adoption."
3. **Seller API & Integration Design:** "My architectural decisions on seller APIs and integration tools determine how effectively sellers list, price, and manage inventory. Better seller tools drive better supply quality and higher GMS."
4. **Payment Processing Architecture:** "I architect the payment systems that process $13B+ in annual GMS. My design decisions on checkout flow, payment methods, and fraud prevention directly impact conversion rates."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and $165K RSUs over 4 years for this Solutions Architect role. Etsy's $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — my architecture enables the advertising and seller platform revenue that funds the buyback. I have competing offers from [Shopify at $272K TC / Pinterest at $268K TC / eBay at $262K TC]. Etsy's buyback-amplified RSUs and my architecture-to-revenue enablement justify a higher share count." Accept at $202K+ base and $145K+ RSUs.
