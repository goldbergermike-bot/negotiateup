**Negotiation DNA**

Etsy Solutions Architects design the technical architecture for Etsy's advertising platform, seller integration APIs, payment processing systems, and the enterprise solutions that connect Etsy's marketplace with external platforms and partners. Your architectural decisions on API design, ad platform integration, and payment processing directly determine the revenue capacity of Etsy's seller tools and advertising business.

**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As a Solutions Architect, I design the integrations that enable Etsy's advertising and seller platform revenue. I want more RSUs — the $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2%, and my architecture directly enables the revenue partnerships that grow Etsy's business. I'm asking for an additional $20K-$35K in RSU grants because the buyback amplifies my ownership, and my architectural decisions determine how effectively Etsy monetizes its seller ecosystem." Push for architecture-level RSU packages reflecting integration-to-revenue enablement.

**Global Levers**

1. **$750M Buyback — Architecture Enables Revenue:** "Etsy's $750M buyback depends on revenue growth — and my architecture enables the advertising platform, seller integrations, and payment systems that generate it. The 14.2% float reduction amplifies my RSUs."
2. **Advertising Platform Architecture:** "I design Etsy's promoted listings and offsite ads architecture — the highest-margin revenue stream. My integration design determines campaign performance and advertiser adoption."
3. **Seller API & Integration Design:** "My architectural decisions on seller APIs and integration tools determine how effectively sellers list, price, and manage inventory. Better seller tools drive better supply quality and higher GMS."
4. **Payment Processing Architecture:** "I architect the payment systems that process $13B+ in annual GMS. My design decisions on checkout flow, payment methods, and fraud prevention directly impact conversion rates."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and $165K RSUs over 4 years for this Solutions Architect role. Etsy's $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — my architecture enables the advertising and seller platform revenue that funds the buyback. I have competing offers from [Shopify at $272K TC / Pinterest at $268K TC / eBay at $262K TC]. Etsy's buyback-amplified RSUs and my architecture-to-revenue enablement justify a higher share count." Accept at $202K+ base and $145K+ RSUs.
