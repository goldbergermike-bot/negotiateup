**$750M Share Buyback — The 14.2% Stock Floor**

Etsy announced a $750M share repurchase program in February 2026 — buying back 14.2% of its outstanding float. This is the strongest signal a company can send about stock undervaluation: Etsy is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars to buy its own shares, reducing supply and creating a price floor. "As a Product Manager, my product decisions directly determine Etsy's GMS trajectory. I want more RSUs because the $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — amplifying my ownership. My product roadmap on search, discovery, and buyer engagement drives the revenue growth that makes the buyback possible. I'm asking for an additional $25K-$40K in RSU grants. The buyback tells me Etsy's stock is undervalued — I want my compensation weighted toward the asset management is actively accumulating." Push for PM-level RSU packages that reflect product-driven revenue impact.

**Global Levers**

1. **$750M Buyback — Product-Driven GMS Growth:** "Etsy's $750M buyback is funded by GMS growth — and my product roadmap drives it. The 14.2% float reduction amplifies my RSUs. I want equity-heavy comp because my product decisions determine revenue trajectory."
2. **Search & Discovery Product Strategy:** "I define how 96M+ buyers find products on Etsy. My product decisions on search ranking, recommendations, and category design directly determine GMS per visit — Etsy's core revenue metric."
3. **Seller Marketplace Health:** "My product strategy for seller tools, pricing, and onboarding determines the quality and quantity of Etsy's supply side — the unique goods that differentiate Etsy from every other marketplace."
4. **Advertising Product Revenue:** "I own Etsy's advertising product roadmap — promoted listings, display ads, and offsite ads. My product decisions directly generate Etsy's highest-margin revenue stream."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $198K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Manager role. Etsy's $750M buyback reduces float by 14.2% — my product roadmap on search, discovery, and advertising drives the GMS growth funding the buyback. RSUs are amplified ownership. I have competing offers from [Shopify at $302K TC / Pinterest at $298K TC / eBay at $292K TC]. Etsy's buyback-amplified equity and my product-level GMS impact justify a higher share count." Accept at $208K+ base and $178K+ RSUs.
