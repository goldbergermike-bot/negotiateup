**Negotiation DNA**

Visa's Software Engineer role sits at the foundational layer of the world's most pervasive payment network — a system processing over 65,000 transactions per second across 200+ countries and territories on behalf of 4B+ cardholders. This is not generic backend work. Every line of code ships into a regulated, real-time financial infrastructure where latency is measured in milliseconds and errors are measured in dollars. The January 2026 launch of the Trusted Agent Protocol fundamentally elevates what it means to be a Software Engineer at Visa: you are now a Standard-Bearer, building the bridge between AI-driven intent and secure payment execution at planetary scale.

The Trusted Agent Protocol positions Visa as the trust layer for autonomous AI commerce. As a Software Engineer, you are among the first cohort writing the code that enables AI agents to initiate, authorize, and settle transactions on behalf of human principals. This is a once-in-a-generation infrastructure shift — comparable to the original move from magnetic stripe to chip — and the engineers building it will carry outsized leverage in negotiation. Visa's $35B+ revenue engine and $500B+ market cap ensure that compensation is structured to retain the talent powering this transition. The company's RSU program vests over four years with annual cliff releases, and the stock's consistent appreciation (V has outperformed the S&P 500 over every rolling five-year period in the last decade) makes equity a meaningful wealth-building lever.

### Trusted Agent Protocol — The Standard-Bearer Premium

**Lever 1 — Protocol-Native Scarcity:** "I'm excited about the Trusted Agent Protocol launch in January 2026. The engineers building this system from day one will define the security and transaction semantics for AI-initiated payments across Visa's entire 4B+ cardholder base. I'd like my offer to reflect that I'm joining as a Standard-Bearer for this new paradigm — not backfilling a steady-state role."

**Lever 2 — AI-Payment Bridge Complexity:** "The technical challenge of bridging AI intent to secure payment authorization is fundamentally different from conventional API development. I'm being asked to build trust primitives that autonomous agents will rely on across 200+ countries. This complexity justifies positioning my base at the upper quartile of the band — around $160,000 in Foster City."

**Lever 3 — VisaNet Reliability Premium:** "VisaNet processes 65,000+ transactions per second with five-nines uptime. Writing code that ships into this environment carries a reliability bar that most tech companies never approach. I'd like to see the RSU grant increased by 15-20% to reflect the operational rigor required from day one."

**Lever 4 — Competitive Fintech Pull:** "I'm also evaluating opportunities at Stripe and modern fintech platforms where base compensation for equivalent roles starts 10-15% higher. I'd prefer to be at Visa building the Trusted Agent Protocol, but I need the total comp to be competitive. Can we close the gap with an additional sign-on or accelerated first-year vesting?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of $300,000+ in Foster City by anchoring on a $160,000 base (+$5K above midpoint), requesting RSU uplift from $110K to $130K (4yr), and negotiating a $20,000 sign-on bonus to offset first-year vesting lag. Accept-at floor: $270,000 TC. Frame every ask around the Trusted Agent Protocol launch and your role as a Standard-Bearer building AI-secure payment infrastructure that will define Visa's next revenue epoch. If Visa counters below $270K, request a six-month compensation review tied to Protocol delivery milestones.
