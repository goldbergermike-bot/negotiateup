**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Visa build and maintain the data infrastructure that processes, stores, and serves one of the largest transaction datasets on Earth. With 4B+ cards generating billions of transactions daily across 200+ countries, Visa's data pipelines must operate at a scale and reliability standard that few organizations in the world can match. This is not batch-processing analytics work — it is real-time streaming infrastructure that powers fraud detection, authorization decisioning, and network optimization for a system clearing $14+ trillion annually. The January 2026 launch of the Trusted Agent Protocol introduces an entirely new data layer: AI-agent transaction events, delegation audit trails, trust-score computations, and agent-credential lifecycle data that must be ingested, processed, and made queryable at VisaNet speed. Data Engineers on this initiative are Standard-Bearers building the data foundation for AI-mediated commerce.

Visa's data engineering compensation reflects the infrastructure-critical nature of the role. Base salaries are competitive with Big Tech data engineering positions, and RSU grants ($120K-$220K over four years) recognize that data engineers with deep knowledge of Visa's pipeline architecture are retention-critical. The Trusted Agent Protocol generates entirely new data schemas and processing requirements — real-time agent activity streams, cross-agent transaction graphs, delegation consent event logs — that require data engineers to build pipelines from the ground up. Visa's $35B+ revenue and consistent stock performance (NYSE: V) make the equity component a meaningful wealth lever, particularly for engineers who build the Protocol's data infrastructure during its formative phase.

### Trusted Agent Protocol — The Standard-Bearer Premium

**Lever 1 — Protocol Data Layer Architect:** "The Trusted Agent Protocol generates entirely new data types — agent credential events, delegation chains, AI-transaction audit logs — that don't fit into Visa's existing data schemas. I'd be designing the data layer from scratch for a new category of financial activity. My base should reflect data-architecture ownership for a greenfield Protocol: $210,000 in Foster City."

**Lever 2 — Standard-Bearer Pipeline Reliability:** "As a Standard-Bearer Data Engineer, every pipeline I build will process AI-agent transactions across 4B+ cardholder accounts in real time. A pipeline failure doesn't just delay an analytics report — it could blind fraud detection systems to adversarial AI-agent behavior. I need RSU compensation of $210,000+ to reflect the operational criticality of Protocol data infrastructure."

**Lever 3 — Real-Time Streaming at VisaNet Scale:** "The Trusted Agent Protocol requires real-time streaming pipelines that match VisaNet's 65,000+ TPS throughput. Building streaming infrastructure at this scale, with the consistency and durability guarantees that financial data demands, is a specialized skill. I'm asking for a 15% uplift on the initial RSU grant to reflect the streaming-at-scale premium."

**Lever 4 — Competitive Data Engineering Market:** "Data Engineers with real-time streaming experience at financial-network scale are being aggressively recruited by Databricks, Snowflake, Stripe, and major investment banks. I have competing offers packaging $460K+ TC. I want to build the Trusted Agent Protocol's data layer at Visa because the scale is unmatched, but I need the total comp to close the gap. Can we add a $25,000 sign-on and increase RSU to $220,000?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of $430,000-$475,000 in Foster City by anchoring base at $210,000, requesting RSU grant of $210,000 (4yr), pushing bonus to 18% target ($37,800), and securing a $25,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $370,000 TC. Lead with the Trusted Agent Protocol's novel data requirements — Visa needs Data Engineers who can build real-time pipelines for a data type that has never existed. Position yourself as the Standard-Bearer constructing the data foundation for AI-agent commerce at global scale. If equity is capped, negotiate for a guaranteed first-year refresh of $55,000+ RSU tied to Protocol data-pipeline deployment milestones and inclusion in Visa's data-platform architecture review committee.
