**Negotiation DNA**

The Engineering Manager at Visa leads the teams that build, ship, and operate the payment infrastructure underpinning $14+ trillion in annual transaction volume. This is not a people-management role grafted onto a tech company — it is an operational leadership position within one of the most critical financial systems on the planet. Every sprint, every deployment, every incident response you oversee touches 4B+ cardholders across 200+ countries. The January 2026 launch of the Trusted Agent Protocol amplifies this responsibility exponentially: you will be building and managing the engineering teams that deliver Visa's AI-commerce trust layer, making you a Standard-Bearer not just for your org, but for the entire Protocol's delivery timeline.

Visa compensates Engineering Managers with a blend of base, RSU, and annual bonus that reflects both technical depth and organizational leverage. The RSU component is substantial — $200K-$360K over four years — because Visa recognizes that manager attrition creates cascading delivery risk. With the Trusted Agent Protocol in active build, Visa cannot afford to lose an EM mid-cycle; this gives candidates meaningful negotiation leverage on both equity quantum and vesting structure. The bonus component (typically 15-25% of base) is tied to team delivery metrics and can be negotiated upward by demonstrating prior track record of shipping zero-downtime financial systems. Visa's $35B+ revenue base and consistent stock appreciation (NYSE: V) ensure that total comp compounds meaningfully over a four-year tenure.

### Trusted Agent Protocol — The Standard-Bearer Premium

**Lever 1 — Delivery-Critical Leadership:** "The Trusted Agent Protocol has a January 2026 launch date and the teams building it need experienced engineering leadership now. I'm not joining to manage a steady-state org — I'm being hired to build and lead teams through a high-stakes delivery cycle. My base should reflect delivery-critical urgency: $250,000 in Foster City."

**Lever 2 — Standard-Bearer Org Builder:** "As a Standard-Bearer Engineering Manager, I'll be hiring, retaining, and developing the engineers who will define Visa's AI-commerce infrastructure for the next decade. The organizational decisions I make — team topology, hiring bar, technical culture — will compound across the Protocol's lifecycle. I'd like RSU compensation of $340,000+ to reflect the long-term organizational value I'm building."

**Lever 3 — Cross-Functional Protocol Coordination:** "Managing the Trusted Agent Protocol requires coordinating across security, product, infrastructure, and compliance teams — not just leading a single pod. This cross-functional scope is closer to a Director-level responsibility at most tech companies. I'm asking for a bonus target of 25% of base, reflecting the coordination premium."

**Lever 4 — Retention Symmetry:** "You're asking me to build a team and then retain them through a multi-year Protocol build. I need the same retention incentives I'll be fighting to get for my reports. A front-loaded vesting schedule (35/30/20/15) and a $50,000 sign-on bonus would demonstrate that Visa is as committed to retaining me as I'll be to retaining my team."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of $620,000-$685,000 in Foster City by anchoring base at $250,000, requesting RSU grant of $340,000 (4yr), pushing bonus target to 25% ($62,500), and negotiating a $50,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $530,000 TC. Lead with the Trusted Agent Protocol delivery timeline — January 2026 is immovable, and Visa needs EMs who can build teams fast and ship reliably. If equity is capped, negotiate for a guaranteed first-year refresh of $80,000+ RSU and a written commitment to Director-track promotion review at 18 months. Frame yourself as a Standard-Bearer building the org, not just managing it.
