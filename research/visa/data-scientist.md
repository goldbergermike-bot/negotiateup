**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Visa operate on one of the richest transaction datasets in the world — billions of purchase events spanning every merchant category, geography, and consumer demographic across 200+ countries. This is not academic data science; every model you build directly impacts fraud detection rates, authorization optimization, and revenue forecasting for a network that clears $14+ trillion annually. The January 2026 launch of the Trusted Agent Protocol introduces an entirely new data domain: AI-agent transaction patterns, delegation trust scores, and autonomous spending behaviors that have never been observed at scale. Data Scientists on this initiative are Standard-Bearers building the analytical foundation for an economy where AI agents transact on behalf of 4B+ cardholders.

Visa's data science compensation is anchored in the recognition that transaction data is the company's most strategic asset. Base salaries are competitive with Big Tech data science roles, and RSU grants ($130K-$240K over four years) reflect the retention-critical nature of data talent with deep domain expertise in payment networks. The bonus component (15-20% of base) is tied to model impact metrics — fraud reduction, authorization uplift, revenue attribution — and the Trusted Agent Protocol will generate entirely new metric categories. Visa's $35B+ revenue and consistent stock appreciation (NYSE: V) make the equity component a meaningful wealth lever, particularly for Data Scientists who join during the Protocol's formative phase and build irreplaceable institutional knowledge.

### Trusted Agent Protocol — The Standard-Bearer Premium

**Lever 1 — Novel Data Domain:** "The Trusted Agent Protocol will generate an entirely new category of transaction data — AI-agent spending patterns, delegation trust scores, cross-agent interaction graphs. No one has modeled this data before because it hasn't existed. I'd be building the foundational analytical frameworks from scratch. My base should reflect first-mover analytical ownership: $215,000 in Foster City."

**Lever 2 — Standard-Bearer Fraud Intelligence:** "As a Standard-Bearer Data Scientist, I'll be designing the fraud detection models that distinguish legitimate AI-agent transactions from adversarial ones across 4B+ cardholders. The false-positive cost on AI-agent transactions is potentially orders of magnitude higher than card-present fraud. I need RSU compensation of $230,000+ to reflect the risk-management value of getting these models right."

**Lever 3 — Network-Scale Model Impact:** "Every model I build will be evaluated against Visa's global transaction volume — billions of transactions per day across 200+ countries. A 0.1% improvement in authorization rates translates to hundreds of millions in recovered revenue. I'm asking for a bonus target of 22% to reflect the direct revenue impact of data science at VisaNet scale."

**Lever 4 — Competitive Data Science Market:** "Data Scientists with payment-network and fraud-detection expertise are being aggressively recruited by Stripe, JPMorgan, and Google Pay. I have competing offers that package $480K+ TC at comparable levels. I want to build the Trusted Agent Protocol's data layer at Visa, but I need the total comp to close the gap. Can we increase the RSU to $240,000 and add a $30,000 sign-on?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of $460,000-$505,000 in Foster City by anchoring base at $215,000, requesting RSU grant of $230,000 (4yr), pushing bonus to 22% target ($47,300), and securing a $30,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $400,000 TC. Lead with the Trusted Agent Protocol's novel data challenges — Visa needs Data Scientists who can build models for an entirely new transaction type before adversaries learn to exploit it. Position yourself as the Standard-Bearer creating the analytical infrastructure for AI-agent commerce. If equity is capped, negotiate for a guaranteed first-year refresh of $60,000+ RSU tied to Protocol fraud-model deployment milestones.
