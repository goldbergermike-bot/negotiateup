**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Visa are the guardians of the world's most targeted financial infrastructure. VisaNet processes over 65,000 transactions per second across 200+ countries, and every one of those transactions relies on security primitives — encryption, tokenization, authentication, authorization — that Security Engineers design, implement, and defend. At $14+ trillion in annual transaction volume, a security breach at Visa would be a global financial event. The January 2026 launch of the Trusted Agent Protocol makes this role existentially critical: Visa is creating a framework that allows AI agents to initiate financial transactions on behalf of human principals, and the security model underpinning this framework must be airtight. Security Engineers on this initiative are Standard-Bearers building the trust boundary between autonomous AI and real-money settlement for 4B+ cardholders.

Visa's security compensation reflects the acute scarcity of engineers who can operate at the intersection of payment-network security and emerging AI threat models. Base salaries are at or above Big Tech security roles, and RSU grants ($150K-$280K over four years) are structured to prevent attrition to hedge funds, government agencies, and fintech competitors who aggressively recruit Visa security talent. The Trusted Agent Protocol introduces novel attack surfaces — agent impersonation, delegation abuse, cross-agent collusion — that require security engineers with both classical cryptographic expertise and modern AI-adversarial thinking. Visa's $35B+ revenue and $500B+ market cap (NYSE: V) provide the financial runway to pay premium comp for security talent that prevents existential risk.

### Trusted Agent Protocol — The Standard-Bearer Premium

**Lever 1 — Novel Threat Surface Ownership:** "The Trusted Agent Protocol introduces attack vectors that have never existed in payment networks — agent credential hijacking, delegation chain manipulation, AI-adversarial transaction injection. I'd be the Security Engineer designing defenses against threats that the industry hasn't even fully catalogued. My base should reflect novel-threat-surface ownership: $235,000 in Foster City."

**Lever 2 — Standard-Bearer Trust Architecture:** "As a Standard-Bearer Security Engineer, I'm responsible for the cryptographic trust model that 4B+ cardholders will rely on when delegating spending authority to AI agents. If I get this wrong, the entire Trusted Agent Protocol fails — not just technically, but reputationally. I need RSU compensation of $270,000+ to reflect the existential-risk-mitigation value of this work."

**Lever 3 — Regulatory Security Compliance:** "The Trusted Agent Protocol must satisfy PCI-DSS, PSD2 SCA, NIST AI Risk Management Framework, and emerging AI governance regulations across 200+ countries. I'll be the engineer ensuring the Protocol's security architecture passes regulatory scrutiny in every jurisdiction. I'm asking for a 22% bonus target to reflect the compliance-assurance premium."

**Lever 4 — Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers with payment-network cryptographic expertise and AI-adversarial modeling skills are extraordinarily rare. I have competing offers from two FAANG companies and a major hedge fund's cybersecurity division, all packaging $550K+ TC. I want to protect the Trusted Agent Protocol at Visa, but the total comp needs to be competitive. Can we increase the RSU to $280,000 and add a $40,000 sign-on?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of $520,000-$572,000 in Foster City by anchoring base at $235,000, requesting RSU grant of $270,000 (4yr), pushing bonus to 22% target ($51,700), and securing a $40,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $450,000 TC. Lead with the Trusted Agent Protocol's unprecedented security challenges — Visa is building a system where AI agents transact real money, and the security model must be unbreakable from day one. Position yourself as the Standard-Bearer protecting Visa's reputation and 4B+ cardholder trust. If equity is capped, negotiate for a security-clearance premium, a guaranteed first-year refresh of $70,000+ RSU, and inclusion in Visa's offensive-security red team rotation.
