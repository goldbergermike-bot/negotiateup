**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Visa orchestrate the delivery of payment infrastructure that 4B+ cardholders depend on across 200+ countries. This is not Agile ceremony facilitation — it is the operational coordination of complex, multi-team, multi-region engineering programs within a system where delivery failures have direct financial consequences. Visa's payment network processes 65,000+ transactions per second, and every program a TPM manages must ship without degrading that throughput. The January 2026 launch of the Trusted Agent Protocol is the highest-stakes program at Visa: it requires coordinating engineering, security, product, compliance, legal, and partner teams across multiple geographies to deliver a new AI-commerce trust layer on a fixed timeline. TPMs leading this effort are Standard-Bearers responsible for the Protocol's delivery cadence.

Visa compensates TPMs with a structure that reflects their cross-functional leverage. Base salaries are competitive with Big Tech TPM roles, and RSU grants ($130K-$240K over four years) serve as retention tools for program leaders whose institutional knowledge of Visa's delivery processes makes them difficult to replace. The bonus component (15-22% of base) is tied to program delivery milestones — on-time launches, quality gates, partner readiness — all of which are intensely scrutinized for the Trusted Agent Protocol. With $35B+ in annual revenue and a $500B+ market cap, Visa has the financial resources to pay premium comp for TPMs who can drive the Protocol to successful launch. Candidates with experience in financial-grade program management, multi-region rollouts, or regulatory-impacted delivery will command the upper half of the band.

### Trusted Agent Protocol — The Standard-Bearer Premium

**Lever 1 — Protocol Launch Ownership:** "The Trusted Agent Protocol has a January 2026 launch date that is immovable — it's been announced to partners, regulators, and investors. I'd be the TPM driving this launch across multiple engineering teams and geographies. Program ownership of a CEO-level initiative justifies premium positioning: my base should be $220,000 in Foster City."

**Lever 2 — Standard-Bearer Coordination Scope:** "As a Standard-Bearer TPM, I'll be coordinating across 6+ functional areas — engineering, security, product, compliance, legal, and partner readiness — simultaneously, across multiple time zones and regulatory jurisdictions. This coordination scope is closer to a Director of Program Management at most tech companies. I'd like RSU compensation of $230,000+ to reflect the organizational leverage."

**Lever 3 — Regulatory-Impacted Delivery:** "The Trusted Agent Protocol touches financial regulations in every market Visa operates in — PSD2 in Europe, Dodd-Frank in the US, and emerging AI governance frameworks globally. Managing delivery against a moving regulatory landscape adds complexity that typical tech programs never face. I'm asking for a bonus target of 22% to reflect the regulatory coordination premium."

**Lever 4 — Delivery Continuity Insurance:** "Replacing a TPM mid-program is one of the most disruptive events in software delivery. If I leave during the Trusted Agent Protocol build, the institutional knowledge loss would delay launch by months. I'd like a front-loaded vesting schedule (35/30/20/15) and a $35,000 sign-on to align my retention incentives with the program timeline."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target total comp of $470,000-$513,000 in Foster City by anchoring base at $220,000, requesting RSU grant of $230,000 (4yr), pushing bonus to 22% target ($48,400), and securing a $35,000 sign-on. Accept-at floor: $400,000 TC. Lead with the Trusted Agent Protocol's fixed launch deadline — January 2026 is non-negotiable, and the TPM is the person accountable for hitting it. Position yourself as the Standard-Bearer driving delivery of Visa's most important initiative across 200+ countries. If equity is capped, negotiate for a program completion bonus of $50,000 tied to successful Protocol launch and a guaranteed first-year refresh of $60,000+ RSU.
