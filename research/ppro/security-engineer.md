### Security Engineer — PPRO Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes PPRO's LPM Expansion strategy, translating the Scalapay Southern Europe partnership into a security engineering compensation framework spanning London, Munich, and Singapore markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £75,000–£110,000 | £25,000–£50,000 | £100,000–£160,000 |
| Munich (EUR) | €80,000–€115,000 | €23,000–€48,000 | €103,000–€163,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$100,000–S$145,000 | S$32,000–S$65,000 | S$132,000–S$210,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers at PPRO protect the LPM infrastructure through which 100+ local payment methods process transactions across dozens of markets. In payment infrastructure, security is existential — a breach in PPRO's platform would cascade across every PSP and platform partner on the network. The Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026) elevates the security engineering mandate: expanding LPM coverage introduces new attack surfaces including BNPL credit application fraud, identity verification challenges, and consumer financial data protection across distinct Southern European regulatory regimes.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| PPRO Level | Adyen Equivalent | Checkout.com Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security L1 |
| Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Engineer | Security L2 |

Security engineers in payment infrastructure command a structural premium due to the catastrophic cost of security failures. PPRO's position as the LPM infrastructure layer amplifies this — a security incident at PPRO impacts not just one merchant but the entire partner ecosystem. This multiplied blast radius justifies compensation above standard fintech security benchmarks.

#### PPRO LPM Expansion & Regional Impact Lever

The **Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026)** introduces significant new security challenges. Expanding LPM coverage across Southern Europe means securing BNPL credit flows, ensuring compliance with GDPR and local Southern European data protection regulations, and building fraud prevention systems calibrated to regional threat patterns.

For Security Engineers, the Regional Impact is existentially important:
- **LPM security architecture**: Securing 100+ local payment method connectors, each with unique security requirements — the Scalapay expansion adds BNPL-specific attack surfaces including credit application fraud and synthetic identity attacks
- **Multi-jurisdiction compliance**: GDPR, PSD2/PSD3, and local financial regulations in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal each impose distinct security requirements on LPM infrastructure
- **LPM fragmentation security**: The complexity of securing 100+ payment methods with different authentication protocols, data handling requirements, and fraud patterns is a security challenge unique to PPRO's infrastructure position
- **Partner trust security**: PPRO's partners entrust their transaction security to PPRO's infrastructure — adding Scalapay's BNPL product raises the security bar for every partner on the network
- **Regional Impact framing**: Frame your work as "securing PPRO's LPM expansion across Southern Europe against an expanding threat surface" — this connects security work to the company's strategic growth narrative

The complexity premium of securing regulatory, technical, and cultural differences across 100+ payment methods creates a security engineering role with exceptional scope and responsibility.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: LPM Security Architecture**
> "The Scalapay Southern Europe expansion introduces new attack surfaces specific to BNPL and local payment methods — credit application fraud, synthetic identity attacks, and consumer financial data exposure across Southern European jurisdictions. I'll be architecting the security posture for PPRO's LPM expansion from the ground up."

**Lever 2: Regulatory Compliance Security**
> "LPM infrastructure in Southern Europe must comply with GDPR, PSD2/PSD3, and local financial regulations across Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. Security engineering at the intersection of 100+ local payment methods and evolving regulatory frameworks requires deep specialized expertise. I'd like a 25% increase on the equity component."

**Lever 3: Partner Trust Security**
> "PPRO's partners entrust their transaction security to PPRO's infrastructure. Adding Scalapay's BNPL capabilities and expanding LPM coverage across Southern Europe raises the security bar for every partner. As the security engineer responsible for the expansion, I'm directly protecting partner trust."

**Lever 4: Fintech Security Talent Scarcity**
> "Security engineers with payment infrastructure and LPM fraud prevention experience are among the most competitive hires in fintech. I'm also speaking with Stripe and Checkout.com security teams. I need compensation to reflect market rates for fintech security — targeting £105,000+ base."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Start at £105,000 base for London (€110,000 Munich / S$140,000 Singapore), anchoring on the LPM security architecture ownership and partner trust responsibility. Accept no lower than £82,000 (€86,000 / S$108,000) but push for options of £45,000+ (4yr vest). Frame: "I'm the security engineer who ensures PPRO's LPM expansion across Southern Europe doesn't become a liability — the cost of getting security wrong in payment infrastructure is existential."
