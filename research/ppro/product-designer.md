#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £65,000–£95,000 | £18,000–£38,000 | £83,000–£133,000 |
| Munich (EUR) | €70,000–€100,000 | €16,000–€36,000 | €86,000–€136,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$85,000–S$125,000 | S$22,000–S$48,000 | S$107,000–S$173,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Designers at PPRO design the interfaces and experiences through which PSPs and global platforms access hundreds of local payment methods. PPRO's infrastructure-as-a-service model means designers create B2B tooling that impacts how millions of transactions are processed globally. The Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026) introduces a new design challenge: creating LPM and BNPL checkout and integration experiences optimized for Southern European markets where consumer payment expectations differ significantly from Northern Europe.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| PPRO Level | Adyen Equivalent | Checkout.com Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Product Designer | Product Designer | Product Designer | Designer L1 |
| Senior Product Designer | Senior Product Designer | Senior Product Designer | Designer L2 |

PPRO designers operate at the intersection of complex payment infrastructure and merchant-facing experiences. Unlike consumer-facing fintech design, PPRO's design challenges involve abstracting the complexity of 100+ local payment methods into intuitive integration surfaces — a specialized skill that commands a premium.

#### PPRO LPM Expansion & Regional Impact Lever

The **Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026)** creates urgent design challenges for PPRO. Expanding LPM coverage across Southern Europe means designing new payment flows, partner dashboards, and integration surfaces that surface BNPL and other local payment methods as first-class options within PPRO's platform.

For Product Designers, the Regional Impact includes:
- **LPM checkout experience design**: Creating checkout flows that support BNPL and diverse local payment methods for Southern European consumers — each market has distinct UX expectations
- **Multi-market design system**: Extending PPRO's design system to accommodate localized payment experiences across Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal while maintaining platform consistency
- **LPM fragmentation simplification through design**: The core design challenge is making 100+ local payment methods feel simple and unified to merchants integrating PPRO's API — design is the layer that tames this fragmentation for human users
- **Regional Impact framing**: Frame your work as "designing the experience layer that simplifies payment fragmentation across Southern Europe" — this strategic language justifies design compensation above standard B2B SaaS benchmarks

The complexity premium of designing for regulatory, technical, and cultural differences across 100+ payment methods creates a design role with exceptional scope.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: LPM Checkout Experience Design**
> "The Scalapay Southern Europe expansion means PPRO needs to design entirely new LPM checkout flows for Southern European markets. These payment experiences must work seamlessly within PPRO's infrastructure while meeting local consumer expectations across Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. Designing payment experiences that convert across diverse markets is a specialized skill."

**Lever 2: Multi-Market Design System Complexity**
> "PPRO's platform spans 100+ local payment methods across dozens of markets. The Scalapay expansion means extending the design system to accommodate BNPL and diverse LPM flows. This multi-market design complexity — localization, regulatory compliance UX, and partner customization — is well beyond standard B2B design scope."

**Lever 3: Partner-Facing Design Impact**
> "My design work will directly impact how PPRO's partner network presents local payment methods to their merchants and consumers. The Scalapay integration design will be among the most visible outputs of this partnership. I'm looking for an equity grant that reflects the revenue impact of well-designed payment experiences."

**Lever 4: Fintech Design Talent Scarcity**
> "Designers who understand both financial infrastructure and consumer payment UX are exceptionally rare. I'm also speaking with Stripe and Checkout.com, where design compensation is at the top of the European fintech market. I'd like PPRO's offer to be competitive with those benchmarks — specifically, a 15% base increase and a 25% equity increase."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Start at £90,000 base for London (€95,000 Munich / S$120,000 Singapore), anchoring on the LPM checkout experience design expertise and Scalapay expansion visibility. Accept no lower than £72,000 (€76,000 / S$92,000) but push for options of £35,000+ (4yr vest). Frame: "I'm designing the experience layer that determines whether Southern Europe's local payment methods convert on PPRO's platform — that's a direct revenue impact."
