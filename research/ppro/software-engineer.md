### Software Engineer — PPRO Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes PPRO's LPM Expansion strategy, translating the Scalapay Southern Europe partnership into a software engineering compensation framework spanning London, Munich, and Singapore markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £55,000–£75,000 | £20,000–£40,000 | £75,000–£115,000 |
| Munich (EUR) | €58,000–€78,000 | €18,000–€38,000 | €76,000–€116,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$72,000–S$100,000 | S$25,000–S$50,000 | S$97,000–S$150,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Software Engineers at PPRO are the foundational builders of the local payment method (LPM) infrastructure that connects hundreds of payment methods into a single API for global merchants. As PPRO aggressively expands LPM coverage across Southern Europe through the Scalapay partnership (February 2026), SWEs are directly responsible for building and maintaining the integrations that onboard new payment methods, handle multi-currency transaction flows, and ensure regulatory compliance across jurisdictions. This makes the role both technically demanding and strategically critical — a combination that should be reflected in compensation. PPRO's position as the infrastructure layer beneath PSPs like Stripe, Adyen, and Checkout.com means engineers here work on systems of exceptional complexity and scale.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| PPRO Level | Adyen Equivalent | Checkout.com Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| SWE I | Software Engineer I | Junior Engineer | L1/New Grad |
| SWE II | Software Engineer II | Software Engineer | L2 |

PPRO's engineering culture emphasizes ownership of payment integrations end-to-end. Unlike Adyen, which operates a monolithic platform, PPRO's microservices architecture means individual engineers often own entire LPM connectors. Compared to Checkout.com and Stripe, PPRO operates as the infrastructure layer behind these companies — a complexity multiplier that justifies premium compensation for the depth of payment domain knowledge required.

#### PPRO LPM Expansion & Regional Impact Lever

The **Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026)** represents a pivotal expansion moment for PPRO. Scalapay, a leading BNPL provider in Italy, France, and Spain, chose PPRO as its infrastructure backbone to expand local payment method access across Southern European markets. This partnership validates PPRO's "Regional Impact" model — the thesis that a single infrastructure layer can tame the fragmentation of hundreds of local payment methods across regulatory regimes, currencies, and consumer preferences.

For Software Engineers, the Regional Impact is direct and immediate:
- **Direct integration work**: Building and maintaining Scalapay BNPL connectors for Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese markets
- **Regulatory complexity**: Each Southern European market carries unique PSD2/PSD3 compliance requirements, anti-fraud mandates, and consumer protection rules that must be encoded into the integration layer
- **Scale impact**: Every connector built serves the entire merchant ecosystem — a single integration effort multiplied across thousands of global merchants
- **LPM fragmentation simplification**: PPRO's core mission is making 100+ local payment methods accessible through one API — Software Engineers are the ones who make this abstraction real
- **Regional Impact positioning**: Frame your work as "simplifying payment fragmentation across Southern Europe" rather than "writing API integrations" — this language aligns with PPRO's strategic narrative and justifies higher compensation

The LPM expansion mandate means PPRO needs engineers who can navigate the intersection of regulatory, technical, and cultural differences across 100+ payment methods. This complexity premium is real and should be priced into your offer.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: LPM Integration Complexity**
> "I understand PPRO manages integrations across 100+ local payment methods, each with unique regulatory and technical requirements. My experience building payment integrations positions me to contribute immediately to the Scalapay Southern Europe expansion, which I'd expect to be reflected in my offer."

**Lever 2: Competing Fintech Offers**
> "I'm currently evaluating opportunities at Checkout.com and Adyen, where the base for this level starts at £70,000 in London. Given PPRO's infrastructure complexity — you're essentially the layer beneath these competitors — I'd expect compensation to be competitive."

**Lever 3: Multi-Market Engineering Premium**
> "Building software that must comply with regulatory frameworks across 30+ countries requires a different caliber of engineering than single-market products. I'd like my compensation to reflect this multi-jurisdiction complexity premium."

**Lever 4: Private Company Equity Upside**
> "As a private company, PPRO's options carry both risk and asymmetric upside. I'd like to discuss either an increased options grant to compensate for liquidity risk, or a base salary adjustment that accounts for the illiquidity discount on private equity."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Start at £72,000 base for London (€75,000 Munich / S$95,000 Singapore), emphasizing the LPM integration complexity premium. Accept no lower than £60,000 (€63,000 / S$80,000) but push for enhanced options grant of at least £35,000 (4yr vest) if base flexibility is limited. Frame every counteroffer around the Scalapay expansion timeline — "the Southern Europe rollout creates urgency that my payment integration skills directly address."
