### Technical Program Manager — PPRO Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes PPRO's LPM Expansion strategy, translating the Scalapay Southern Europe partnership into a technical program management compensation framework spanning London, Munich, and Singapore markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £80,000–£115,000 | £28,000–£55,000 | £108,000–£170,000 |
| Munich (EUR) | €85,000–€120,000 | €26,000–€52,000 | €111,000–€172,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$108,000–S$150,000 | S$35,000–S$68,000 | S$143,000–S$218,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Technical Program Managers at PPRO orchestrate the delivery of complex LPM infrastructure programs that span 100+ local payment methods across dozens of markets. PPRO's infrastructure-as-a-service model means TPMs must coordinate across engineering, product, compliance, and partner teams to deliver at scale. The Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026) represents the most significant program management challenge at PPRO: integrating BNPL and LPM infrastructure across Southern European markets while maintaining velocity on existing commitments across the platform.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| PPRO Level | Adyen Equivalent | Checkout.com Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Technical Program Manager | Technical Program Manager | TPM | TPM L2 |
| Senior TPM | Senior TPM | Senior TPM | TPM L3 |

PPRO TPMs manage programs with exceptional cross-functional complexity — every LPM integration touches engineering, compliance, commercial, and partner teams across multiple geographies. Unlike TPMs at single-product companies, PPRO TPMs must hold context across 100+ payment methods and their interdependencies.

#### PPRO LPM Expansion & Regional Impact Lever

The **Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026)** is the most significant program management initiative at PPRO. Integrating BNPL and LPM infrastructure for Southern Europe — Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal — requires coordinating across every function of the company on an externally committed timeline.

For Technical Program Managers, the Regional Impact is orchestrational:
- **Cross-functional program delivery**: Coordinating engineering teams building LPM connectors, compliance teams navigating Southern European regulatory frameworks, product teams defining the integration experience, and partner teams preparing the merchant network
- **LPM expansion sequencing**: Managing the priority and sequencing of new local payment method integrations across Southern European markets — each market has distinct regulatory timelines and technical dependencies
- **Partnership-driven timelines**: The Scalapay partnership has externally committed milestones that create hard deadlines — TPMs own delivery against dates that impact PPRO's commercial relationships
- **LPM fragmentation program management**: Managing 100+ payment method integrations means managing 100+ sets of dependencies, timelines, and stakeholders — a program management challenge unique to PPRO's infrastructure position
- **Regional Impact framing**: Position yourself as someone who "orchestrates PPRO's LPM expansion across Southern Europe" — this frames the TPM as the connective tissue of the company's most strategic initiative

The complexity premium of managing programs across regulatory, technical, and cultural differences in 100+ payment methods creates a TPM role with exceptional scope.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Scalapay Program Delivery Ownership**
> "The Scalapay Southern Europe partnership is PPRO's highest-priority program. As the TPM owning this initiative, I'll be driving the integration of LPM infrastructure across Southern European markets. Program delivery directly unblocks revenue. My compensation should reflect that I'm delivering the company's most strategic initiative."

**Lever 2: Cross-Functional LPM Complexity**
> "The Scalapay LPM integration spans engineering, compliance, product, and partner management across dozens of markets with a new focus on Southern Europe. This cross-functional scope — managing a local payment method infrastructure rollout touching 100+ LPMs — is exceptional program management complexity."

**Lever 3: Regulatory Program Navigation**
> "LPM infrastructure in Southern European markets involves navigating evolving financial regulations across Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. As TPM, I'll be managing regulatory compliance workstreams alongside technical delivery. This dual-track program management warrants a premium."

**Lever 4: Retention Through Integration Milestones**
> "The Scalapay LPM integration is a multi-quarter program with critical milestones. PPRO needs TPM continuity through the entire integration cycle. I'd like to negotiate milestone-based equity refreshes tied to program delivery."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Start at £110,000 base for London (€115,000 Munich / S$145,000 Singapore), anchoring on the Scalapay program delivery ownership and cross-functional LPM complexity. Accept no lower than £86,000 (€90,000 / S$112,000) but push for options of £50,000+ (4yr vest). Frame: "I'm the TPM who will orchestrate PPRO's most important strategic initiative — the Scalapay Southern Europe LPM expansion."
