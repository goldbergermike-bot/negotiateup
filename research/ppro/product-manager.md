#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £80,000–£115,000 | £30,000–£60,000 | £110,000–£175,000 |
| Munich (EUR) | €85,000–€120,000 | €28,000–€58,000 | €113,000–€178,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$110,000–S$155,000 | S$40,000–S$75,000 | S$150,000–S$230,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Managers at PPRO shape the roadmap for local payment method infrastructure, defining how hundreds of LPMs are surfaced and integrated through a single API for PSPs and global platforms. The Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026) has injected a transformative product initiative into PPRO's roadmap: building the BNPL and LPM infrastructure product layer that will unlock Southern Europe for every merchant on the PPRO network. PMs who join now will own the definition and execution of this product strategy, making it one of the highest-impact PM roles in European fintech.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| PPRO Level | Adyen Equivalent | Checkout.com Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Product Manager | Product Manager | Product Manager | PM L2 |
| Senior Product Manager | Senior PM | Senior PM | PM L3 |

PPRO PMs operate at the intersection of payment infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and merchant experience. Unlike PMs at Stripe or Adyen who may focus on single-market products, PPRO PMs must think across 100+ local payment methods and dozens of regulatory jurisdictions — a breadth of scope that demands both technical depth and strategic vision.

#### PPRO LPM Expansion & Regional Impact Lever

The **Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026)** represents PPRO's most significant Regional Impact product initiative. By enabling Scalapay's BNPL expansion across Southern Europe, PPRO is proving that its LPM infrastructure can productize the most complex payment methods — including BNPL with its unique credit, installment, and consumer protection requirements.

For Product Managers, the Regional Impact is defining:
- **Product vision ownership**: Defining how BNPL and other LPMs are productized for Southern European markets — Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal — across PPRO's entire merchant network
- **Multi-market product complexity**: Balancing the needs of PSPs, platforms, and end consumers across distinct Southern European markets with different regulatory frameworks and consumer payment preferences
- **LPM fragmentation simplification**: The core PM challenge at PPRO is making 100+ local payment methods feel simple and unified to merchants — the Scalapay expansion tests this product thesis at scale
- **Regional Impact framing**: Position yourself as the PM who "productizes Southern Europe's payment fragmentation into a simple merchant experience" — this aligns with PPRO's strategic narrative

The complexity premium of managing product decisions across regulatory, technical, and cultural differences in 100+ payment methods creates a PM role unlike any other in fintech.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: LPM Product Vision Ownership**
> "The Scalapay Southern Europe expansion is the most significant product initiative at PPRO. As a Product Manager, I'll be defining how local payment methods — including BNPL — are productized across Southern Europe for PPRO's entire merchant network. This is greenfield product strategy with massive revenue impact."

**Lever 2: Multi-Market Product Complexity**
> "PPRO's infrastructure spans 100+ local payment methods across dozens of markets. The Scalapay expansion adds a new layer of multi-market product complexity. I'll be balancing regulatory requirements, consumer preferences, and merchant needs across Southern European markets. That's a scope premium that justifies top-of-band compensation."

**Lever 3: Partner Ecosystem Product Leadership**
> "PPRO's partners — PSPs and global platforms — will all benefit from the LPM infrastructure I'll be productizing. My product decisions will directly impact partner adoption and transaction volume. I'd like to negotiate an equity package that reflects this leverage — specifically, a 30% increase on the initial option grant."

**Lever 4: Competitive PM Market**
> "I'm evaluating PM opportunities at Stripe, Checkout.com, and Adyen, all of which are building payment method coverage. PPRO's infrastructure-as-a-service positioning post-Scalapay is uniquely compelling because I'd own the product layer, not just a feature. But I need the total compensation to be competitive — I'm targeting a package at £160,000+ total comp."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Start at £110,000 base for London (€115,000 Munich / S$150,000 Singapore), anchoring on the LPM product vision ownership and Scalapay expansion urgency. Accept no lower than £88,000 (€92,000 / S$115,000) but push for options of £55,000+ (4yr vest). Frame: "I'll be defining the product strategy for PPRO's most important growth initiative — the Scalapay Southern Europe LPM expansion."
