### Data Engineer — PPRO Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes PPRO's LPM Expansion strategy, translating the Scalapay Southern Europe partnership into a data engineering compensation framework spanning London, Munich, and Singapore markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £70,000–£105,000 | £22,000–£48,000 | £92,000–£153,000 |
| Munich (EUR) | €75,000–€110,000 | €20,000–€45,000 | €95,000–€155,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$95,000–S$140,000 | S$30,000–S$60,000 | S$125,000–S$200,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Engineers at PPRO build and maintain the data pipelines that power 100+ local payment methods across dozens of markets. PPRO's LPM infrastructure generates massive volumes of transaction data, and Data Engineers ensure this data flows reliably to analytics, risk, compliance, and partner reporting systems. The Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026) has introduced a new data engineering imperative: building real-time and batch data pipelines for BNPL transaction flows, LPM performance analytics, and consumer behavior tracking across Southern European markets with distinct data residency requirements.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| PPRO Level | Adyen Equivalent | Checkout.com Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data Engineer | DE L1 |
| Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer | DE L2 |

PPRO Data Engineers manage pipelines that span 100+ local payment methods — each generating data in different formats, frequencies, and regulatory contexts. This multi-source complexity exceeds what Data Engineers at single-platform companies like Stripe or Adyen typically encounter, justifying compensation at the upper range of fintech benchmarks.

#### PPRO LPM Expansion & Regional Impact Lever

The **Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026)** creates urgent data engineering demand. Expanding LPM coverage across Southern Europe means building data pipelines for new payment method connectors, ensuring compliance with GDPR and local data residency requirements, and delivering analytics that inform PPRO's LPM expansion strategy.

For Data Engineers, the Regional Impact is foundational:
- **LPM data pipeline architecture**: Building pipelines for BNPL and other local payment method data flows — each LPM generates data with unique structures, frequencies, and regulatory constraints
- **Multi-market data compliance**: Southern European data residency requirements (GDPR plus Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese local regulations) add compliance complexity to every pipeline
- **LPM fragmentation in data**: Managing data from 100+ payment methods means managing 100+ data schemas, quality standards, and delivery patterns — a data engineering challenge unique to PPRO's position as the LPM infrastructure layer
- **Foundational analytics enablement**: Every data science model, risk assessment, partner report, and compliance audit depends on the pipelines Data Engineers build — the Scalapay expansion amplifies this foundational role
- **Regional Impact framing**: Frame your work as "building the data foundation that enables PPRO's LPM expansion analytics across Southern Europe" — this positions data engineering as strategically essential

The complexity premium of engineering data pipelines across regulatory, technical, and cultural differences in 100+ payment methods creates a data engineering role with exceptional scope.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: LPM Data Pipeline Architecture**
> "The Scalapay Southern Europe expansion requires building entirely new data pipelines for BNPL and local payment method transaction data across Southern European markets. Each LPM generates data differently. I'll be architecting these pipelines across PPRO's platform serving 100+ payment methods. This is greenfield data infrastructure for PPRO's most strategic initiative."

**Lever 2: Southern Europe Data Compliance**
> "LPM data pipelines for Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal must comply with GDPR and local data residency requirements. Building compliant data infrastructure across four regulatory jurisdictions while maintaining pipeline performance is specialized work. I'd like my compensation to include a 20% equity increase."

**Lever 3: Foundational Data Infrastructure Value**
> "Every data science model, risk assessment, partner report, and compliance audit at PPRO depends on the data pipelines I'll build. The Scalapay LPM expansion amplifies this — without reliable data infrastructure, PPRO can't do risk modeling, fraud detection, or partner reporting for Southern Europe."

**Lever 4: Fintech Data Engineering Competition**
> "Data engineers with financial transaction pipeline experience are highly competitive hires. Stripe, Adyen, and Checkout.com are all scaling their data teams. PPRO's Scalapay LPM expansion makes this compelling, but total compensation needs to match the market — I'm targeting £100,000+ base with an enhanced option grant."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Start at £100,000 base for London (€105,000 Munich / S$135,000 Singapore), anchoring on the LPM data pipeline architecture expertise and Scalapay expansion data needs. Accept no lower than £78,000 (€82,000 / S$100,000) but push for options of £42,000+ (4yr vest). Frame: "Every analytics capability for PPRO's Southern Europe LPM expansion depends on the data pipelines I build — that's a foundational role worth investing in."
