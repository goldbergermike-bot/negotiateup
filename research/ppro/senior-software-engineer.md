### Senior Software Engineer — PPRO Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes PPRO's LPM Expansion strategy, translating the Scalapay Southern Europe partnership into a senior engineering compensation framework spanning London, Munich, and Singapore markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £80,000–£110,000 | £40,000–£80,000 | £120,000–£190,000 |
| Munich (EUR) | €85,000–€115,000 | €38,000–€75,000 | €123,000–€190,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$110,000–S$150,000 | S$50,000–S$100,000 | S$160,000–S$250,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Senior Software Engineers at PPRO are the technical backbone of LPM infrastructure — they own the architecture, reliability, and scalability of payment connectors that process billions in transaction volume across 100+ local payment methods. As PPRO pursues the Scalapay Southern Europe expansion (February 2026), Senior SWEs lead the design of new integrations, mentor junior engineers on payment domain complexity, and make architectural decisions that scale across dozens of markets. This dual responsibility — deep technical ownership plus strategic architectural influence — creates a compensation premium over standard fintech senior roles.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| PPRO Level | Adyen Equivalent | Checkout.com Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Senior SWE | Senior Software Engineer | Senior Engineer | L3 |
| Senior SWE (top band) | Staff-track | Lead Engineer | L3 (high) |

At the senior level, PPRO engineers typically own 5-15 LPM connectors and are responsible for the full lifecycle — from regulatory research to production monitoring. This end-to-end ownership model exceeds what Adyen or Stripe typically expect at the same level, where engineers often work within narrower service boundaries. Use this expanded scope as a negotiation lever.

#### PPRO LPM Expansion & Regional Impact Lever

The **Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026)** is the most significant Regional Impact initiative in PPRO's recent history. By enabling Scalapay's BNPL infrastructure across Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, PPRO is proving its thesis that a single payment orchestration layer can eliminate the friction of local payment method fragmentation for global merchants.

For Senior Software Engineers, the Regional Impact is amplified:
- **Architecture ownership**: Designing systems that handle the nuances of Southern European payment regulations (PSD2/PSD3 compliance, Strong Customer Authentication variations, local consumer credit laws for BNPL)
- **Cross-team leadership**: Coordinating between PPRO's London, Munich, and Singapore engineering hubs to deliver LPM integrations on the Scalapay timeline
- **Technical decision rights**: Senior engineers make build-vs-partner decisions for each LPM — a high-leverage responsibility that directly impacts PPRO's speed-to-market
- **LPM fragmentation simplification**: At the senior level, you are not just building connectors — you are designing the abstractions that make hundreds of local payment methods feel like one
- **Regional Impact framing**: Position yourself as someone who "architects the simplification of payment fragmentation across Southern Europe" — this strategic language resonates with PPRO leadership and justifies top-of-band offers

The complexity premium of managing regulatory, technical, and cultural differences across 100+ payment methods is at its highest at the senior level, where individual decisions have outsized impact on platform reliability and expansion velocity.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Architectural Ownership of LPM Expansion**
> "The Scalapay Southern Europe expansion requires senior engineers who can architect multi-market payment integrations from scratch. I bring direct experience designing systems that handle regulatory divergence across jurisdictions, and I'd expect my compensation to reflect the architectural ownership this role demands."

**Lever 2: Payment Domain Expertise Premium**
> "Payment infrastructure engineering at PPRO's level — connecting 100+ LPMs into a single API — requires deep domain expertise that takes years to develop. My background in payment systems eliminates the 6-12 month ramp-up period, which has a quantifiable value I'd like reflected in my offer."

**Lever 3: Multi-Hub Coordination Complexity**
> "Coordinating engineering work across London, Munich, and Singapore time zones adds meaningful complexity to the senior role. I've successfully led distributed teams before, and this multi-hub coordination capability should be compensated accordingly."

**Lever 4: Private Equity Upside Negotiation**
> "Given PPRO's private status and the Scalapay expansion signaling strong growth, I'd like to negotiate an enhanced options package. Specifically, I'm looking for a grant in the top quartile for senior engineers — at least £70,000 over the 4-year vest — to align my incentives with the company's LPM expansion trajectory."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Start at £105,000 base for London (€110,000 Munich / S$145,000 Singapore), anchoring on the payment domain expertise premium and Scalapay expansion urgency. Accept no lower than £85,000 (€90,000 / S$115,000) but negotiate aggressively on options — push for £75,000+ (4yr vest) given private company upside. Use the line: "My payment infrastructure experience directly accelerates the Southern Europe LPM rollout, which I understand is a 2026 priority."
