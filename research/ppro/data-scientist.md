### Data Scientist — PPRO Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes PPRO's LPM Expansion strategy, translating the Scalapay Southern Europe partnership into a data science compensation framework spanning London, Munich, and Singapore markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £70,000–£100,000 | £22,000–£48,000 | £92,000–£148,000 |
| Munich (EUR) | €75,000–€105,000 | €20,000–€45,000 | €95,000–€150,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$95,000–S$135,000 | S$30,000–S$60,000 | S$125,000–S$195,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Scientists at PPRO work with one of the richest transaction datasets in fintech — payment data flowing through 100+ local payment methods across dozens of markets. PPRO's LPM infrastructure generates data at massive scale, and the Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026) introduces an entirely new data dimension: BNPL transaction patterns, credit risk signals, and consumer behavior analytics for Southern European markets. Data Scientists joining PPRO now will own the analytical foundation of the company's most strategic growth initiative — the LPM expansion mandate.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| PPRO Level | Adyen Equivalent | Checkout.com Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Scientist | DS L1 |
| Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist | DS L2 |

PPRO Data Scientists have unique access to cross-market LPM transaction data that competitors cannot replicate. While Adyen and Stripe see transactions from their own merchant base, PPRO sees patterns across the entire LPM ecosystem — a data advantage that makes this DS role exceptionally valuable for career development.

#### PPRO LPM Expansion & Regional Impact Lever

The **Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026)** creates urgent demand for data science talent who can build risk models, optimize approval rates, and analyze consumer behavior across Southern European LPM markets. BNPL infrastructure requires sophisticated data science — default prediction, affordability assessment, and fraud detection — all calibrated to local market dynamics.

For Data Scientists, the Regional Impact is analytically rich:
- **LPM behavior analytics**: Analyzing how consumers across Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal interact with different local payment methods — BNPL, real-time bank transfers, digital wallets — to optimize PPRO's integration strategy
- **Risk modeling for LPM expansion**: Building credit risk and fraud models calibrated to Southern European consumer behavior patterns, which differ significantly from Northern European and US markets
- **LPM fragmentation quantification**: Measuring the complexity cost of payment method fragmentation and the value PPRO creates by simplifying it — this data directly informs pricing and commercial strategy
- **Regional Impact framing**: Position yourself as the data scientist who "quantifies the Regional Impact of PPRO's LPM expansion" — this connects your work to the company's strategic narrative

The complexity premium of analyzing regulatory, technical, and cultural differences across 100+ payment methods creates a data science role with exceptional analytical depth.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: LPM Risk Modeling Ownership**
> "The Scalapay Southern Europe partnership means PPRO needs data scientists who can build risk models for BNPL and local payment methods across Southern European markets. I'll be building the analytical engine that determines whether PPRO's LPM expansion is profitable. That's a direct revenue-impact role that warrants top-of-band compensation."

**Lever 2: Cross-Market Data Complexity**
> "PPRO's infrastructure spans 100+ local payment methods across dozens of markets. Adding Scalapay's BNPL data layer creates a uniquely complex analytical environment — I'll be working with transaction data, credit behavior patterns, and fraud signals across diverse Southern European markets with distinct regulatory and economic contexts."

**Lever 3: LPM Data Science Scarcity**
> "Data scientists with experience in payment method analytics and cross-market risk modeling are exceptionally rare. PPRO's position as the LPM infrastructure layer means this is an unusually high-leverage DS role. I'm looking for a 25% increase on the equity component."

**Lever 4: Value Creation Measurement**
> "As a Data Scientist at PPRO, my models will directly impact approval rates, default rates, and partner adoption of LPM products including the Scalapay BNPL integration. These are measurable value-creation metrics tied to PPRO's revenue growth. I'd like to negotiate performance-based equity refreshes tied to model performance benchmarks."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Start at £95,000 base for London (€100,000 Munich / S$130,000 Singapore), anchoring on the LPM risk modeling ownership and Scalapay expansion data needs. Accept no lower than £76,000 (€80,000 / S$100,000) but push for options of £42,000+ (4yr vest). Frame: "My risk models will directly determine the profitability of PPRO's Southern Europe LPM expansion — that's a quantifiable impact on the bottom line."
