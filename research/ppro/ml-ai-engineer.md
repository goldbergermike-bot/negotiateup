### ML/AI Engineer — PPRO Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes PPRO's LPM Expansion strategy, translating the Scalapay Southern Europe partnership into a machine learning and AI engineering compensation framework spanning London, Munich, and Singapore markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £80,000–£120,000 | £28,000–£58,000 | £108,000–£178,000 |
| Munich (EUR) | €85,000–€125,000 | €26,000–€55,000 | €111,000–€180,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$108,000–S$160,000 | S$38,000–S$72,000 | S$146,000–S$232,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers at PPRO build the machine learning systems that power fraud detection, transaction optimization, and intelligent routing across 100+ local payment methods in dozens of markets. PPRO's LPM infrastructure generates data at enormous scale, creating ideal conditions for ML applications in payments. The Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026) has opened a transformative ML workstream: building AI-powered credit risk assessment, fraud detection, and LPM routing optimization for BNPL and local payment method infrastructure across Southern European markets.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| PPRO Level | Adyen Equivalent | Checkout.com Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| ML/AI Engineer | ML Engineer | ML Engineer | ML L1 |
| Senior ML/AI Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | ML L2 |
| Staff ML/AI Engineer | Principal ML Engineer | Staff ML Engineer | ML L3 |

ML/AI roles at PPRO have uniquely high leverage because models operate across the entire LPM ecosystem — a single fraud model improvement impacts 100+ payment methods simultaneously. This platform-wide ML leverage exceeds what engineers typically find at competitors with narrower payment method coverage.

#### PPRO LPM Expansion & Regional Impact Lever

The **Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026)** creates transformative ML/AI opportunities. Expanding LPM coverage across Southern Europe means building ML models calibrated to Southern European consumer behavior, fraud patterns, and credit risk profiles — all of which differ significantly from Northern European and US patterns.

For ML/AI Engineers, the Regional Impact is analytically transformative:
- **LPM-specific ML models**: Building fraud detection and transaction optimization models that account for the unique characteristics of different local payment methods — BNPL, real-time bank transfers, digital wallets — each with distinct fraud signatures and optimization opportunities
- **Southern Europe model calibration**: Training ML models on Southern European consumer behavior patterns — economic conditions, credit history depth, and fraud patterns in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal differ materially from other markets
- **LPM routing intelligence**: Building ML systems that intelligently route transactions through the optimal local payment method based on success rates, cost, and consumer preference — a core value driver for PPRO's platform
- **LPM fragmentation as ML advantage**: The fragmentation of 100+ payment methods creates a rich feature space for ML models that a single-method platform cannot replicate
- **Regional Impact framing**: Position yourself as the ML engineer who "builds the intelligence layer that optimizes PPRO's LPM expansion across Southern Europe" — this connects ML work to revenue impact

The complexity premium of building ML systems across regulatory, technical, and cultural differences in 100+ payment methods creates an ML/AI role with exceptional analytical depth and business impact.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: LPM Credit Risk ML Ownership**
> "The Scalapay Southern Europe expansion means PPRO needs ML engineers who can build credit risk and fraud detection models for BNPL and local payment methods across Southern European markets. My models will directly determine approval rates, default rates, and the profitability of PPRO's LPM infrastructure. That's a direct P&L impact role."

**Lever 2: Southern Europe ML Model Calibration**
> "Training ML models for Southern European consumer behavior requires understanding local market dynamics — economic conditions, credit patterns, and fraud signatures in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. PPRO's 100+ LPM platform needs models tuned to these specific markets. This is specialized ML work warranting top-of-band compensation."

**Lever 3: Fraud Detection AI for LPM Infrastructure**
> "LPM fraud patterns are fundamentally different from standard card fraud — each local payment method has unique fraud signatures. I'll be building AI-powered fraud detection across PPRO's entire LPM platform, with the Scalapay BNPL expansion adding new attack vectors. I'd like a 30% increase on the equity component reflecting this revenue protection value."

**Lever 4: ML Engineering Talent Premium**
> "ML/AI engineers with fintech and payment method experience are among the most competitive hires globally. I'm also evaluating opportunities at Stripe, Adyen, and Klarna. PPRO's Scalapay partnership creates one of the most impactful ML roles in European fintech — but I need total compensation to match the top of the market. I'm targeting £170,000+ total comp."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Start at £115,000 base for London (€120,000 Munich / S$155,000 Singapore), anchoring on the LPM ML model ownership and Scalapay expansion P&L impact. Accept no lower than £88,000 (€92,000 / S$115,000) but push for options of £52,000+ (4yr vest). Frame: "My ML models will determine whether PPRO's LPM expansion across Southern Europe is profitable — that's a direct line from my work to the company's P&L."
