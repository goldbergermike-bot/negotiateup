#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £95,000–£130,000 | £50,000–£100,000 | £145,000–£230,000 |
| Munich (EUR) | €100,000–€135,000 | €48,000–€95,000 | €148,000–€230,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$130,000–S$175,000 | S$65,000–S$125,000 | S$195,000–S$300,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering Managers at PPRO lead the teams that build and maintain the infrastructure connecting hundreds of local payment methods to global merchants through a single API. The role combines people leadership with deep payment domain expertise — managers must understand the regulatory, technical, and cultural complexity of LPM integration to effectively prioritize their teams' work, hire the right talent, and deliver on aggressive expansion timelines like the Scalapay Southern Europe rollout (February 2026). The LPM expansion mandate means EMs are simultaneously scaling teams, delivering integrations, and navigating cross-hub coordination across London, Munich, and Singapore.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| PPRO Level | Adyen Equivalent | Checkout.com Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | M1 |
| Senior EM | Senior EM | Director of Engineering | M2 |

PPRO engineering managers typically oversee teams of 6-12 engineers working on specific LPM verticals or platform capabilities. Unlike pure people-management roles at larger companies, PPRO EMs maintain significant technical involvement — reviewing architectural decisions, participating in incident response, and making build-vs-partner decisions for new payment method integrations. This dual-track expectation justifies compensation above pure management benchmarks.

#### PPRO LPM Expansion & Regional Impact Lever

The **Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026)** creates immediate and significant demand for strong engineering management. As PPRO expands BNPL and LPM coverage across Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, EMs must scale their teams, manage cross-timezone coordination between London, Munich, and Singapore, and deliver integrations on partnership-driven timelines.

For Engineering Managers, the Regional Impact manifests as:
- **Team scaling**: The Scalapay expansion likely requires growing integration teams by 20-40%, meaning EMs are simultaneously hiring, onboarding, and delivering — a high-pressure combination that commands premium compensation
- **Cross-hub leadership**: Managing engineers across PPRO's London, Munich, and Singapore offices requires distributed leadership skills and timezone management expertise
- **LPM fragmentation management**: EMs must understand the complexity of 100+ local payment methods to effectively prioritize and sequence their teams' integration work across regulatory, technical, and cultural dimensions
- **Stakeholder management**: EMs interface directly with Scalapay's technical teams, PPRO's product and compliance functions, and regional regulatory bodies — a multi-stakeholder environment that exceeds typical EM scope
- **Regional Impact framing**: Position yourself as someone who "scales the engineering organization to deliver on PPRO's LPM expansion mandate" — this strategic framing moves the conversation beyond team-size-based compensation to impact-based compensation

The complexity premium of managing teams that navigate regulatory, technical, and cultural differences across 100+ payment methods is substantial and should be clearly articulated during negotiation.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Partnership Delivery Accountability**
> "The Scalapay Southern Europe expansion has externally committed timelines that my team would be accountable for delivering against. This partnership-driven delivery model adds significant business accountability beyond standard engineering management, and I'd expect that reflected in my compensation."

**Lever 2: Multi-Hub Leadership Complexity**
> "Managing engineering teams across London, Munich, and Singapore requires distributed leadership expertise that not all EM candidates possess. My experience leading cross-timezone teams positions me to hit the ground running, which I'd like reflected in my offer."

**Lever 3: Hiring and Scaling Urgency**
> "The LPM expansion mandate means my first priority will be scaling the team — and hiring payment engineers in this market is both slow and expensive. My network and hiring track record in fintech directly accelerate PPRO's growth plans, which has quantifiable value."

**Lever 4: Technical Depth Premium**
> "PPRO's EM role requires maintaining technical depth alongside people leadership — I'll be reviewing architectural decisions for LPM integrations, not just managing headcount. This dual-track expectation justifies compensation above pure management benchmarks at companies with less technical EM roles."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Start at £125,000 base for London (€130,000 Munich / S$170,000 Singapore), anchoring on the partnership delivery accountability and multi-hub leadership complexity. Accept no lower than £100,000 (€105,000 / S$135,000) but push for options of £90,000+ (4yr vest) given team-scaling impact. Use: "I'll be scaling the engineering team to deliver on the Scalapay timeline — the hiring urgency alone makes this role worth top-of-band compensation."
