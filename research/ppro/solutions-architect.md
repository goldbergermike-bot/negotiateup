### Solutions Architect — PPRO Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes PPRO's LPM Expansion strategy, translating the Scalapay Southern Europe partnership into a solutions architecture compensation framework spanning London, Munich, and Singapore markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £85,000–£120,000 | £28,000–£58,000 | £113,000–£178,000 |
| Munich (EUR) | €90,000–€125,000 | €26,000–€55,000 | €116,000–€180,000 |
| Singapore (SGD) | S$115,000–S$160,000 | S$38,000–S$72,000 | S$153,000–S$232,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Solutions Architects at PPRO serve as the technical bridge between the LPM infrastructure platform and the PSPs and global platforms that integrate with it. With 100+ local payment methods across dozens of markets, Solutions Architects must deeply understand PPRO's payment infrastructure and translate it into integration architectures tailored to each partner's needs. The Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026) has created a surge of demand for SAs who can design and deliver LPM and BNPL integration architectures for partners expanding into Southern European markets.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| PPRO Level | Adyen Equivalent | Checkout.com Equivalent | Stripe Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect | SA L2 |
| Senior Solutions Architect | Senior SA | Senior SA | SA L3 |

PPRO Solutions Architects sit at the intersection of technical delivery and commercial impact. Unlike SAs at pure-play SaaS companies, PPRO SAs must navigate the complexity of 100+ local payment methods — each with unique technical requirements, regulatory constraints, and settlement flows. This payment-specific depth commands a premium.

#### PPRO LPM Expansion & Regional Impact Lever

The **Scalapay Southern Europe partnership (February 2026)** is a flagship initiative that will be architected and implemented across PPRO's entire partner network. Solutions Architects will design how partners consume PPRO's LPM infrastructure — including the new BNPL capabilities — for Southern European markets.

For Solutions Architects, the Regional Impact is commercially direct:
- **Partner integration design**: Designing how PSPs and platforms integrate PPRO's LPM infrastructure for Southern European markets — each partner has unique technical requirements that must be mapped to PPRO's API
- **LPM integration complexity**: BNPL and other local payment methods require more complex integration architectures than standard card payments — asynchronous flows, credit decisioning APIs, installment management, and regulatory compliance across Southern European jurisdictions
- **Revenue-generating architecture**: Every LPM integration architecture the SA delivers unlocks new transaction volume for PPRO — this is directly revenue-generating technical work
- **LPM fragmentation simplification for partners**: The SA's core job is making the complexity of 100+ local payment methods disappear for the partner — designing clean integration surfaces that abstract away the underlying fragmentation
- **Regional Impact framing**: Position yourself as someone who "translates PPRO's LPM expansion into partner revenue across Southern Europe" — this frames the SA role as commercially strategic

The complexity premium of architecting solutions across regulatory, technical, and cultural differences in 100+ payment methods creates an SA role with exceptional commercial leverage.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Scalapay Partner Integration Design**
> "The Scalapay Southern Europe expansion means PPRO's entire partner network will need integration architectures for new LPM capabilities including BNPL. As a Solutions Architect, I'll be designing these integrations for Southern European markets. Each integration I architect directly drives adoption and revenue."

**Lever 2: LPM Integration Complexity**
> "Local payment method integrations are significantly more complex than standard payment integrations. BNPL requires asynchronous flows, credit decisioning APIs, and regulatory compliance across Southern European markets. I'll be architecting these solutions across PPRO's 100+ LPM platform. That's a complexity premium over standard SA compensation."

**Lever 3: Revenue-Generating Architecture**
> "Solutions Architects at PPRO don't just design systems — we drive partner adoption. Every Scalapay LPM integration I deliver for a partner unlocks new transaction volume. I'd like to negotiate a variable compensation component tied to partner integration milestones."

**Lever 4: Competitive SA Market**
> "I'm in conversations with Stripe, Adyen, and Checkout.com for Solutions Architect roles. PPRO's LPM infrastructure positioning post-Scalapay is uniquely attractive, but I need total compensation to be competitive. I'm targeting £165,000+ total comp."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Start at £115,000 base for London (€120,000 Munich / S$155,000 Singapore), anchoring on the revenue-generating architecture and Scalapay partner integration urgency. Accept no lower than £90,000 (€95,000 / S$120,000) but push for options of £52,000+ (4yr vest). Frame: "I'm the person who will translate PPRO's LPM infrastructure into partner revenue across Southern Europe — every integration I design directly drives transaction volume."
