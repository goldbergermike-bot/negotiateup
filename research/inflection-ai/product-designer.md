**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Inflection AI design the experience of interacting with Pi — a personal AI assistant that must feel empathetic, warm, and genuinely helpful. This is among the most challenging design problems in consumer AI: designing conversation interfaces that feel natural rather than transactional, creating personalization controls that are powerful yet simple, and building trust through design that makes users feel safe sharing personal thoughts with an AI. Pi's design language directly shapes how millions of people experience AI companionship.
