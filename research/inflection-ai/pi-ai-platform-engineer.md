### Pi AI Platform Engineer | Inflection AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Microsoft-Level Comp + Equity | Microsoft Acquired Team | Palo Alto | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15-30% ML PREMIUM** | Pi AI Assistant

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Palo Alto / Bay Area | $220K-$305K | $180K-$430K | $20K-$40K | $270K-$418K |
| Seattle | $213K-$296K | $180K-$430K | $20K-$40K | $262K-$407K |
| Remote US | $198K-$275K | $162K-$387K | $18K-$36K | $243K-$376K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The Pi AI Platform Engineer is the signature role at Inflection AI — the position at the core of building Pi, the personal AI assistant designed to be empathetic, helpful, and deeply personalized. Following the Microsoft acquisition of key team members and technology, this role now benefits from Microsoft-level compensation structures (including liquid RSUs and bonuses) while working on one of the most ambitious consumer AI products in the world. You will build the platform infrastructure for Pi: the conversation engine, the personalization systems, the memory and context management, and the inference infrastructure that makes Pi feel like a thoughtful, emotionally intelligent companion. The +15-30% ML Premium reflects the scarcity of engineers who can build emotionally intelligent AI systems at scale.

**Level Mapping:** Inflection Pi Platform Engineer = Microsoft L64-L65 = Google L5-L6 = Meta E5-E6 = OpenAI Research Engineer

**The Microsoft Comp Structure — Liquid Equity + Bonus**
The Microsoft acquisition transformed Inflection's compensation structure: instead of pre-IPO equity bets, you get liquid Microsoft RSUs that vest quarterly, plus annual bonuses. This is a massive de-risk compared to pure startup equity. Use this: "Inflection offers the best of both worlds — startup-level impact on Pi with Microsoft-level comp stability. The liquid RSUs and bonus make this materially better than pre-IPO startup offers." Push for higher RSU grants by emphasizing the Microsoft comp framework.

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Scarcity:** "Building an emotionally intelligent personal AI assistant requires a rare combination of NLP expertise, personalization systems engineering, and conversational AI design. Fewer than 500 engineers have this specific skill set at production scale: $300K base, $420K RSU/4yr, and $35K bonus."
2. **Microsoft Comp Benchmark:** "Microsoft L65 engineers earn $280K+ base with $400K+ RSU. Inflection's Pi role offers startup impact with Microsoft comp — I want the comp to reflect the Microsoft benchmark: $300K base."
3. **Competing AI Offers:** "Anthropic offers $280K / $500K equity (pre-IPO). OpenAI offers $275K / $600K equity. Inflection's liquid RSUs and bonus make the comp directly comparable — $300K base and $420K RSU/4yr."
4. **Pi Product Impact:** "Pi's personalization and emotional intelligence are its key differentiators. As a platform engineer building these systems, my work directly defines what makes Pi special: $295K base."
5. **Empathetic AI Expertise:** "Building AI that feels emotionally intelligent and personalized requires specialized conversational AI and personalization expertise — this isn't standard LLM engineering. That specialization: $300K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm an AI platform engineer specializing in conversational AI, personalization systems, and emotionally intelligent AI design. I'm holding an Anthropic offer at $280K / $500K pre-IPO equity and a Google offer at $275K / $450K RSU. Inflection's Pi product is uniquely compelling — building a truly personal AI assistant is the most important consumer AI challenge. The liquid RSUs and Microsoft comp structure are a major advantage over pre-IPO equity. To join: $300K base, $415K RSU/4yr, $35K bonus, and a $60K signing bonus. At $300K, I commit immediately. My floor is $270K."
