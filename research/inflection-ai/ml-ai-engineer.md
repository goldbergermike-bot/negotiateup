**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Inflection AI work directly on the models powering Pi — the personal AI assistant designed to be uniquely empathetic, helpful, and personalized. You'll optimize conversation models, build personalization ML systems, improve emotional intelligence capabilities, and develop the inference infrastructure for real-time, personalized AI interaction. The +15-30% ML Premium reflects the extreme demand for engineers who can build emotionally intelligent and personalized AI systems at scale. Microsoft's comp structure provides liquid RSUs, making this one of the best risk-adjusted ML engineering opportunities.

**Level Mapping:** Inflection ML/AI Engineer = Microsoft L63-L65 ML Engineer = Google L4-L6 ML Engineer = Meta ML IC4-IC6

**The Microsoft Comp Structure**
ML engineers get liquid RSUs and bonuses. The comp stability combined with cutting-edge AI work is a strong value proposition.

**Global Levers**
1. **ML Premium (+15-30%):** "Conversational AI ML engineers with personalization and emotional intelligence expertise are exceptionally rare: $285K base, $410K RSU/4yr."
2. **Microsoft ML Engineer Benchmark:** "Microsoft L65 ML engineers earn $270K+ base. Inflection ML: $280K base."
3. **Competing Offers:** "OpenAI offers $275K / $600K equity. Anthropic at $270K / $500K equity. Inflection's liquid RSUs: $285K base and $410K RSU/4yr."
4. **Personalization ML Scarcity:** "Building personalized AI at Pi's level requires specialized ML skills — user modeling, preference learning, adaptive conversation. That scarcity: $280K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm an ML engineer specializing in conversational AI, personalization, and emotionally intelligent systems. Holding OpenAI at $275K / $600K equity. Inflection's Pi product is uniquely compelling, and the liquid RSUs de-risk the comp. To join: $285K base, $405K RSU/4yr, $35K bonus, and a $55K signing bonus. Floor is $255K."
