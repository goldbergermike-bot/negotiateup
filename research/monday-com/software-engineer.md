### Monday.com Work OS & Competitive Market Premium

Monday.com's Work OS is the company's core differentiator — a platform that is flexible enough to replace dozens of point solutions. Unlike traditional project management tools, the Work OS enables customers to build custom applications, automate workflows, and visualize data — all without writing code. Software Engineers who build and extend this platform create multiplicative value.

The competitive landscape drives premium compensation. Monday.com competes directly with Asana, Smartsheet, Notion, ClickUp, and Microsoft. The company must attract and retain top engineering talent to maintain its competitive position, which means compensation must be competitive with both Israeli tech leaders and global SaaS companies.

Monday.com's mondayDB — the custom database engine that powers the Work OS — is a significant engineering achievement. Engineers who work on the data layer, automation engine, or platform extensibility are contributing to the most technically sophisticated components of the product.

My experience in [platform engineering / database systems / API design] positions me to contribute to the Work OS at the level of sophistication the $12B valuation demands."

Monday.com's AI-powered automation is a key competitive differentiator: "I will build intelligent automation features that help teams work more efficiently. My ML/AI experience enables me to create automation capabilities that differentiate Monday.com from every competitor."
