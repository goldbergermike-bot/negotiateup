Monday.com (NASDAQ: MNDY) at ~$280/share.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Monday.com

The Work OS Platform Engineer role exists because Monday.com's value proposition depends entirely on platform flexibility. Unlike point solutions that solve one problem, the Work OS enables teams to build custom applications for any workflow — project management, CRM, software development, marketing, HR, and more. The platform layer that makes this flexibility possible is the most technically challenging and strategically important system at Monday.com.

Monday.com's $12B market cap is built on the Work OS thesis: that a single flexible platform can replace dozens of point solutions. Work OS Platform Engineers are the people who make this thesis real by building the abstraction layer, data engine (mondayDB), automation framework, and extensibility model that enable infinite customization.

The competitive urgency of Israeli tech culture amplifies the importance of this role. Monday.com competes aggressively against Asana, Smartsheet, ClickUp, and Notion — and the Work OS Platform is the technical foundation of competitive differentiation. Engineers who can evolve this platform faster and more elegantly than competitors are Monday.com's most valuable asset.

#### Monday.com Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Monday.com Internal Level | Typical YoE | Focus Area |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Work OS Platform Engineer | WOSPE (IC4) | 3–5 years | Feature-level platform contributions |
| Senior Work OS Platform Engineer | Sr WOSPE (IC5) | 5–8 years | Subsystem ownership, platform evolution |
| Staff Work OS Platform Engineer | Staff WOSPE (IC6) | 8–12 years | Cross-product platform architecture |
| Principal Work OS Architect | Principal (IC7) | 12+ years | Platform-wide strategy and vision |

*Note: This role maps to premium compensation bands due to the combination of platform engineering and Work OS expertise.*

### Monday.com Work OS & Competitive Market Premium

As the Work OS Platform Engineer, the platform is your entire negotiation thesis. You build the system that makes Monday.com different from every competitor. The platform layer — data modeling, automation, customization, and extensibility — is what transforms Monday.com from a project management tool into an operating system for work.

mondayDB, the custom database engine, is the technical backbone of the Work OS. It must handle millions of boards, billions of items, and complex relationships between data types — all while delivering sub-second query performance for real-time collaboration. Work OS Platform Engineers who can optimize and evolve mondayDB are working on Monday.com's most valuable technical asset.

Use this in every negotiation: "Monday.com's $12B valuation is built on the Work OS platform. I am the engineer who builds and evolves this platform — the data engine, the automation framework, and the extensibility layer. My compensation should reflect the foundational importance of the Work OS to Monday.com's competitive position and market cap."

#### Global Lever 1: Work OS Platform & mondayDB

Core platform engineering: "I will build and optimize mondayDB and the Work OS platform layer — the technical foundation that enables infinite workflow customization. My experience in [database engineering / platform design / distributed systems] is the exact skill set the Work OS requires."

#### Global Lever 2: AI & Automation

AI-powered platform: "I will integrate AI into the Work OS platform — enabling intelligent automation, smart recommendations, and AI-assisted workflow creation. Building AI into a flexible platform is architecturally more complex than building AI into a point solution."

#### Global Lever 3: Enterprise & CRM Expansion

Enterprise platform capabilities: "I will build the enterprise features of the Work OS — multi-tenant isolation, governance, compliance, and the scalability that Fortune 500 deployments require."

#### Global Lever 4: Developer Platform & Apps Marketplace

Platform extensibility: "I will build the developer platform that enables third-party applications to extend the Work OS — APIs, SDKs, webhooks, and the marketplace infrastructure that grows Monday.com's ecosystem."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $205,000 base with $180,000 in RSUs over 4 years (~643 shares at ~$280/share). Your accept-at floor should be $280,000 total comp. Cite the Work OS's foundational importance to Monday.com's $12B valuation, your platform engineering expertise, and the competitive Israeli tech talent market. For Tel Aviv, open at $175,000 equiv; for London/Europe, open at GBP 90,000 base. Push for larger RSU grants — the Work OS is the foundation of Monday.com's long-term value.
