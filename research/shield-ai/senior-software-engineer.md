### Senior Software Engineer | Shield AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Early Growth-Stage Defense AI Equity + Mission Premium | $5B+ Private Valuation | AI-Powered Defense Drones | Startup Intensity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego, CA | $165K-$215K | $90K-$250K | Discretionary | $200K-$340K |
| Washington, DC | $160K-$210K | $90K-$250K | Discretionary | $195K-$335K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at Shield AI own critical subsystems across the Hivemind autonomy stack, ground control, simulation, or flight software. At this level, you're the technical owner of systems that autonomous combat aircraft depend on: perception pipelines, planning algorithms, mission execution logic, or the simulation environment used to validate autonomy before flight test. Shield AI's lean engineering team means senior engineers have 2-3x the ownership scope of FAANG equivalents. You work directly with flight test teams, seeing your code fly on real aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base and other test ranges. The feedback loop from code to flight test is weeks, not months.

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI Senior SWE = Google L4-L5 = Anduril Senior SWE -- with aircraft autonomy and flight test integration

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Code-to-Flight-Test Loop:** "I see my code fly on real aircraft within weeks. This feedback loop is faster than traditional aerospace and more consequential than consumer tech."
- **Lean Team, System Ownership:** "I own entire subsystems that Shield AI's autonomous aircraft depend on. My scope is 2-3x a FAANG Senior SWE."
- **Earlier-Stage Impact:** "At Shield AI's stage, each Senior SWE shapes the company's technical trajectory. My architectural decisions define the product."

**Global Levers**

1. **System-Level Ownership:** "I own critical subsystems for autonomous combat aircraft. My technical decisions directly determine vehicle capability."
2. **Flight Test Integration:** "My code flies on real aircraft -- a validation cycle that few software engineers experience."
3. **$5B+ Earlier-Stage Equity:** "Senior-level equity at $5B valuation captures more per-share upside than later-stage companies."
4. **Lean Team Impact:** "Each Senior SWE at Shield AI has outsized impact on the product. My contributions are directly visible."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I own critical autonomous aircraft subsystems with code-to-flight-test loops of weeks, not months. Shield AI's lean team gives me 2-3x the scope of a FAANG Senior SWE. I'm targeting $230K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [Anduril/FAANG] is $310K total comp. Shield AI's earlier-stage equity and my system-level impact must compensate." Accept at $195K+ equity.
