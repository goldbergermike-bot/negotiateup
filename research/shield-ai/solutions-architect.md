### Solutions Architect | Shield AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Early Growth-Stage Defense AI Equity + Mission Premium | $5B+ Private Valuation | Autonomous Drone System Integration | Startup Intensity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego, CA | $155K-$205K | $80K-$230K | Discretionary | $195K-$325K |
| Washington, DC | $155K-$205K | $80K-$230K | Discretionary | $195K-$325K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Shield AI design how autonomous drone systems integrate into military customer operations. You architect deployments for specific military programs: how V-BAT integrates with Navy ship operations, how drone swarms integrate with Army tactical networks, how Hivemind connects to existing military C2 systems. Each customer deployment is unique, requiring deep understanding of both Shield AI's autonomy technology and the customer's existing military infrastructure. SAs travel extensively (40-60%) to military installations, conduct operational demonstrations, and support program evaluations. Your technical architecture directly determines whether Shield AI wins or loses major contracts. [Source: Shield AI SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI SA = AWS Senior SA = Anduril SA -- with autonomous drone system integration and military operational deployment

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Direct Contract Revenue:** "My technical architectures directly determine contract wins. Each demonstration is a $50M-$500M+ revenue opportunity."
- **Military Integration Expertise:** "I integrate autonomous drones into existing military operations. Understanding both autonomy and military C2 is extraordinarily rare."
- **Extensive Military Travel:** "40-60% travel to military installations and classified facilities. The travel and clearance constraints deserve compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **Contract-Winning Architecture:** "My technical demonstrations and architectures directly win contracts worth $50M-$500M+."
2. **Autonomous Systems Integration:** "Integrating autonomous drones into military operations requires understanding both AI and military C2 -- a rare skill combination."
3. **$5B+ Earlier-Stage Equity:** "SA equity at $5B captures significant appreciation potential."
4. **Customer-Facing Revenue Generation:** "I'm a direct revenue generator, not a cost center. My technical credibility wins programs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "My architectures directly win $50M-$500M+ military contracts. Integrating autonomous drones into military operations requires both autonomy and military C2 expertise -- an extraordinarily rare combination. I'm targeting $215K in equity over 4 years. My competing SA offer from [AWS/Anduril] is $290K total comp with less travel. Shield AI's earlier-stage equity and my revenue impact must compensate." Accept at $180K+ equity.
