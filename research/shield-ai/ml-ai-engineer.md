### ML/AI Engineer | Shield AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Early Growth-Stage Defense AI Equity + Mission Premium | $5B+ Private Valuation | Hivemind AI/Autonomous Perception & Planning | Startup Intensity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego, CA | $160K-$215K | $100K-$270K | Discretionary | $205K-$350K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Shield AI build the core intelligence of Hivemind -- the perception, planning, and decision-making algorithms that enable drones to fly autonomously in GPS-denied, communications-denied environments. You work on computer vision for obstacle detection and terrain navigation, reinforcement learning for tactical decision-making, multi-agent coordination for swarm operations, and edge ML inference on SWaP-constrained drone hardware. This is the hardest ML deployment environment in the industry: your models must run in real-time on limited compute, in adversarial conditions, with no cloud fallback, where failure means aircraft loss. ML talent is Shield AI's highest-priority hire -- Hivemind's capability is entirely determined by ML engineering quality. [Source: Shield AI ML Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI ML Eng = Google L4-L5 ML = Waymo Perception/Planning Eng -- with combat environment, GPS-denied, and edge constraints

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Hardest ML Deployment:** "GPS-denied, comms-denied, edge compute, adversarial environment, real-time. This is the most constrained ML deployment environment in the world."
- **ML = Core Product:** "Hivemind IS ML. My work doesn't support a product -- my work IS the product. ML engineers are the most critical hires."
- **Edge ML Expertise:** "Running perception and planning models on SWaP-constrained drone hardware requires edge ML skills that cloud ML engineers don't develop."

**Global Levers**

1. **ML IS the Product:** "Hivemind's capability is 100% determined by ML engineering. My models ARE the autonomous pilot."
2. **Hardest ML Problem:** "GPS-denied autonomous navigation in contested environments with edge compute constraints -- the hardest ML deployment in the industry."
3. **ML Talent Scarcity:** "ML engineers willing to work on defense drones are extremely rare. Competing offers from [DeepMind/Waymo/OpenAI] are significantly higher."
4. **$5B+ Equity -- ML Creates All Value:** "Every dollar of Shield AI's valuation comes from Hivemind's ML capability. My equity directly reflects my work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build the core ML that IS Hivemind -- perception, planning, and decision-making for GPS-denied autonomous flight. This is the hardest ML deployment environment in the world. ML engineers willing to apply skills to defense drones are rare, and competing offers from [Waymo/OpenAI] are $380K+. I'm targeting $250K in equity over 4 years. Shield AI's ML-equals-product thesis and equity trajectory must reflect my role as the builder of the core capability." Accept at $215K+ equity.
