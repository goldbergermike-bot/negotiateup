### Engineering Manager | Shield AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Early Growth-Stage Defense AI Equity + Mission Premium | $5B+ Private Valuation | AI-Powered Defense Drones | Startup Intensity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego, CA | $180K-$230K | $120K-$300K | Discretionary | $235K-$385K |
| Washington, DC | $175K-$225K | $120K-$300K | Discretionary | $230K-$380K |

**Negotiation DNA**

EMs at Shield AI build and lead the engineering teams creating the world's most advanced autonomous combat aircraft. At Shield AI's scale, each EM has significant organizational impact -- you directly shape engineering culture, hiring standards, and team structure. EMs manage across autonomy, flight software, simulation, and ground control teams. The recruiting challenge is intense: attracting top robotics and autonomy talent to a defense company in San Diego requires selling mission, equity upside, and the unique opportunity to see code fly on real aircraft. Shield AI's growth means rapid team expansion -- EMs hired now shape the engineering organization that will carry Shield AI through IPO. [Source: Shield AI EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI EM = Google L5-L6 Manager = Anduril EM -- with earlier-stage organizational influence and aircraft autonomy domain

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Organizational Shaping:** "At Shield AI's stage, EMs hired now define the engineering organization. I'm not joining a machine -- I'm building one."
- **Autonomy Talent Recruiting:** "Recruiting robotics and autonomy engineers to defense is the hardest talent challenge in tech. My team-building capability is extraordinarily valuable."
- **Code-to-Flight Culture:** "I build teams that see code fly on real aircraft. This feedback loop creates unmatched engineering motivation and retention."

**Global Levers**

1. **Organization Building:** "I'm building the engineering organization that will carry Shield AI through IPO. My team structure decisions have decades of impact."
2. **Autonomy Talent Acquisition:** "Recruiting top autonomy talent to defense is the hardest recruiting problem in tech. Each hire I make multiplies Shield AI's capability."
3. **$5B+ Earlier-Stage Equity:** "EM equity at $5B captures significant appreciation. My organizational impact accelerates company growth."
4. **Flight Test Team Leadership:** "I lead teams whose code flies on real aircraft. This is the most motivating engineering management in the industry."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the engineering organization that will carry Shield AI through IPO -- hiring decisions I make now define the company for decades. Recruiting top autonomy talent to defense is the hardest challenge in tech. I'm targeting $275K in equity over 4 years. My competing EM offer from [Google/Anduril] is $380K total comp. Shield AI's earlier-stage equity and my organizational impact must compensate." Accept at $235K+ equity.
