### Product Manager | Shield AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Early Growth-Stage Defense AI Equity + Mission Premium | $5B+ Private Valuation | AI-Powered Defense Drones | Startup Intensity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego, CA | $155K-$205K | $80K-$230K | Discretionary | $195K-$325K |
| Washington, DC | $155K-$205K | $80K-$230K | Discretionary | $195K-$325K |

**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at Shield AI define product strategy for autonomous combat drone systems. You own the roadmap for Hivemind autonomy capabilities, specific aircraft platforms (V-BAT, MQ-35 Fury, Nova), ground control systems, or the simulation and testing infrastructure. Shield AI PMs work directly with military end users -- special operators, Navy combat aviators, and DOD acquisition officials -- to translate operational requirements into product features. At Shield AI's stage, each PM has outsized product influence; your decisions shape the product that the entire company is built around. PM at Shield AI requires deep technical understanding of autonomy, robotics, and aerospace -- this is not consumer product management. [Source: Shield AI PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI PM = Google L5 PM = Anduril PM -- with earlier-stage product influence and aircraft autonomy domain

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Core Product Influence:** "At Shield AI's stage, each PM directly shapes the core product. My product decisions define the company's market position."
- **Military Operator Customer Development:** "I work directly with combat aviators and special operators. My customer discovery happens in military environments."
- **Autonomy-Domain PM:** "Managing product for autonomous aircraft requires deep technical understanding of robotics, perception, and planning. This domain PM skill is rare."

**Global Levers**

1. **Core Product Definition:** "I define the product roadmap for Shield AI's core Hivemind platform. My product decisions determine what the company sells."
2. **Military Customer Intimacy:** "I translate warfighter needs into autonomous capabilities. This customer intimacy directly drives product-market fit."
3. **$5B+ Earlier-Stage Equity:** "PM equity at $5B captures significant appreciation. My product decisions drive contract wins and valuation."
4. **Autonomy-Domain Scarcity:** "PMs who understand autonomous systems, robotics, and military operations are extraordinarily rare."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I define the product roadmap for Shield AI's core Hivemind platform -- product decisions that determine what the company sells and which contracts it wins. Autonomy-domain PMs with military customer skills are extraordinarily rare. I'm targeting $210K in equity over 4 years. My competing PM offer from [Anduril/FAANG] is $300K total comp. Shield AI's earlier-stage equity and my core product influence must compensate." Accept at $180K+ equity.
