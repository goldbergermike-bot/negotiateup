**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Shield AI build the data infrastructure that powers autonomous drone development. You process flight test data from real aircraft missions, simulation data from millions of virtual flights, sensor data (lidar, camera, IMU, GPS-denied navigation), and training data for Hivemind's perception and planning models. The data pipeline is unique: ingesting real-world flight test telemetry and sensor recordings, building training datasets for autonomy models, and enabling rapid iteration on AI pilot capabilities. Data infrastructure quality directly determines how fast Shield AI can improve Hivemind -- better data pipelines mean faster autonomy development. Flight data from real aircraft is irreplaceable and mission-critical. [Source: Shield AI DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI DE = Google L4 DE = Waymo DE -- with flight test data and autonomy training infrastructure

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Flight Test Data Infrastructure:** "I process data from real autonomous aircraft flights -- irreplaceable flight test data that directly drives Hivemind improvement."
- **Autonomy Training Data:** "My data pipelines create the training datasets for Hivemind's AI. Data quality directly determines autonomy capability."
- **Earlier-Stage Impact:** "At Shield AI's stage, data infrastructure decisions I make now define the company's AI development velocity for years."

**Global Levers**

1. **Autonomy Data Pipeline:** "My data infrastructure directly determines how fast Shield AI can improve Hivemind. Better pipelines = faster AI development."
2. **Flight Test Data Processing:** "Real-world flight test data from autonomous aircraft is irreplaceable. My infrastructure ensures this data is captured and processed."
3. **$5B+ Earlier-Stage Equity:** "DE equity at $5B captures significant appreciation potential."
4. **Unique Data Domain:** "Autonomous flight data, GPS-denied navigation telemetry, and multi-sensor fusion datasets are unique to this domain."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build the data infrastructure that directly determines how fast Shield AI can improve Hivemind. Flight test data from real autonomous aircraft is irreplaceable -- my pipelines ensure it drives AI development. I'm targeting $195K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [Databricks/Snowflake] is $290K total comp for cloud data engineering. Shield AI's unique data domain and equity trajectory must compensate." Accept at $165K+ equity.
