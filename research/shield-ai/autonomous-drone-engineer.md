### Autonomous Drone Engineer | Shield AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Early Growth-Stage Defense AI Equity + Mission Premium | $5B+ Private Valuation | AI-Powered Defense Drones | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15-30% Autonomy-Critical Premium** | Startup Intensity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego, CA | $160K-$215K | $100K-$280K | Discretionary | $210K-$360K |
| Washington, DC | $155K-$210K | $100K-$280K | Discretionary | $205K-$355K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Shield AI's signature engineering role -- Autonomous Drone Engineer. Shield AI's core thesis is that the future of combat is autonomous: AI pilots that can fly aircraft without GPS, without communications, and without human intervention in contested environments. You build the autonomy stack (Hivemind) that enables unmanned aircraft to navigate, make tactical decisions, and execute missions independently. Hivemind is Shield AI's moat -- an AI pilot that has been tested in real combat operations (Afghanistan, special operations missions). Shield AI is valued at $5B+ and is the leading pure-play autonomous defense drone company. The equity is early-stage with significant upside if the DOD's autonomous drone pivot accelerates. Comp is competitive with mid-tier tech but below FAANG; the equity thesis is the primary financial argument. [Source: Shield AI Autonomous Drone Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI Autonomous Drone Eng = Google L4-L5 Robotics = Waymo Autonomy Eng -- but with combat deployment and GPS-denied navigation

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Autonomous Drone Engineer builds the AI pilot for combat aircraft:
- **GPS-Denied Navigation:** You build autonomy that works without GPS, without comms, in electronically contested environments -- the hardest navigation problem in robotics
- **Combat-Tested AI:** Hivemind has been deployed in real combat operations. Your code is battle-tested, not just simulation-tested
- **Multi-Platform Autonomy:** Hivemind runs on multiple aircraft platforms (V-BAT, MQ-35 Fury, Nova). You build platform-agnostic autonomy that scales across vehicle types
- **Swarm Intelligence:** You build multi-agent coordination enabling drone swarms to collaborate on missions without centralized control
- **Edge AI in Austere Environments:** Your AI runs on edge compute in a flying vehicle with size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints that don't exist in cloud computing

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation -- The Hivemind Script**

> **"I want to be direct about the Shield AI tradeoff. I'm accepting:**
> - **Early growth-stage company risk ($5B valuation, not yet profitable)**
> - **Combat-deployed software responsibility**
> - **Below-FAANG base with illiquid equity and uncertain exit timeline**
> - **San Diego location (not SF/NYC tech hub compensation)**
> - **Autonomy-specific skills that are rare but narrow**
>
> **In exchange, I need equity that reflects the autonomy-critical premium and Shield AI's position as the leading autonomous combat drone company. The DOD's autonomous drone pivot is a $50B+ opportunity -- my equity must capture it."**

**Global Levers**

1. **Autonomy-Critical Premium (15-30%):** "I build the Hivemind AI pilot -- the core product that defines Shield AI. Without autonomy engineers, there is no company. This is the most critical role."
2. **GPS-Denied Navigation -- Hardest Problem in Robotics:** "Autonomous navigation without GPS in contested environments is harder than anything Waymo or Tesla solves. This skill set is extraordinarily rare."
3. **Combat-Tested AI:** "Hivemind has been deployed in real combat. My code has been battle-tested -- a validation level that no other autonomy company can claim."
4. **DOD Autonomous Drone Pivot:** "The DOD is investing $50B+ in autonomous systems. Shield AI is the leading pure-play autonomous combat drone company."
5. **Multi-Platform Scalability:** "Hivemind runs on V-BAT, MQ-35, and Nova. My autonomy software scales across platforms, multiplying Shield AI's market opportunity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build the Hivemind AI pilot -- GPS-denied autonomous combat navigation that's harder than anything in commercial robotics. This is Shield AI's core product; without autonomy engineers, there is no company. I'm targeting $260K in equity over 4 years with the autonomy-critical premium. My competing offer from [Waymo/Aurora/Anduril] is $320K total comp. Shield AI's combat-tested AI and the DOD autonomous drone pivot make this unique -- but the equity must reflect my role as the builder of the core product." Accept at $220K+ equity.
