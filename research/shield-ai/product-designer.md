### Product Designer | Shield AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Early Growth-Stage Defense AI Equity + Mission Premium | $5B+ Private Valuation | AI-Powered Defense Drones | Startup Intensity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego, CA | $135K-$180K | $60K-$180K | Discretionary | $170K-$270K |
| Washington, DC | $130K-$175K | $60K-$180K | Discretionary | $165K-$265K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Shield AI design the interfaces that military operators use to control autonomous drone systems. You design the ground control station UI where operators monitor and task autonomous aircraft, the mission planning interface where operations are configured, and the tactical display where commanders see autonomous drone swarm status. Your users are military operators under extreme time pressure making life-or-death decisions -- every design choice impacts operational effectiveness. Shield AI's design team is very small, meaning each designer owns massive product surface. Design research happens at military installations with operators who have fundamentally different needs than consumer users. [Source: Shield AI Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI Product Designer = Google L4 UX = Anduril Designer -- with smaller team and more per-designer impact

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Tiny Design Team, Massive Scope:** "Shield AI's design team is a fraction of the size of even Anduril's. I own more product surface per designer than almost anywhere."
- **Military Operator UX:** "I design for combat operators under extreme stress. Military UX requires domain expertise that doesn't transfer from consumer design."
- **Ground Control Station Design:** "I design the primary human interface for autonomous aircraft. My designs determine how effectively operators use Shield AI's products."

**Global Levers**

1. **Per-Designer Impact:** "As one of very few designers, my work defines the entire user experience. My design choices reach every customer."
2. **Military Operator Interface:** "Designing ground control stations for autonomous drones is a unique design domain with life-or-death consequences."
3. **$5B+ Earlier-Stage Equity:** "Design equity at $5B captures significant appreciation. My UX work drives product adoption."
4. **Autonomous Systems UX Scarcity:** "Designers who can create interfaces for autonomous combat systems are extraordinarily rare."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I design the primary operator interfaces for Shield AI's autonomous drone systems -- life-or-death UX for combat operators. As one of very few designers, my per-designer impact is unmatched. I'm targeting $165K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [FAANG] is $260K total comp for consumer design. Shield AI's earlier-stage equity and my outsized design impact must compensate." Accept at $140K+ equity.
