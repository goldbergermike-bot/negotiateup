**Negotiation DNA**

TPMs at Shield AI manage autonomous aircraft programs that span hardware design, software development, autonomy development, flight testing, and military customer delivery. You coordinate V-BAT production and deployment, MQ-35 Fury development programs, Hivemind autonomy releases, and customer integration programs. Unlike FAANG TPMs who manage software-only programs, Shield AI TPMs manage across hardware manufacturing, autonomous software, flight test, and military certification -- the most complex program management in defense tech. Each program has strict military milestones, FAA/DOD certification requirements, and contract delivery dates. Missing a milestone can jeopardize a $100M+ contract. At Shield AI's stage, TPMs directly shape program management processes. [Source: Shield AI TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI TPM = Google L5 TPM = Anduril TPM -- with aircraft manufacturing, flight test, and DOD certification

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Aircraft Program Complexity:** "I manage programs spanning hardware manufacturing, autonomous software, flight test, and military certification. This is the most complex program management in defense tech."
- **Military Milestone Delivery:** "Missing milestones jeopardizes $100M+ contracts. My delivery performance directly determines revenue."
- **Process Building:** "At Shield AI's stage, I'm establishing program management processes, not following existing ones."

**Global Levers**

1. **Aircraft-to-Autonomy Program Scope:** "Hardware + software + autonomy + flight test + certification. No other TPM role spans this many domains."
2. **Contract Milestone Delivery:** "My delivery performance directly determines $100M+ contract evaluations."
3. **$5B+ Earlier-Stage Equity:** "TPM equity at $5B captures significant appreciation as Shield AI scales."
4. **Process Foundation Building:** "I'm establishing the program management processes that will carry Shield AI through IPO and beyond."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage autonomous aircraft programs spanning hardware, autonomy, flight test, and military certification -- the most complex program management in defense tech. Missing milestones jeopardizes $100M+ contracts. I'm targeting $215K in equity over 4 years. My competing TPM offer from [Google/Anduril] is $300K total comp for less complex programs. Shield AI's aircraft program complexity and equity trajectory must compensate." Accept at $180K+ equity.
