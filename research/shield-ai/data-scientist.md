### Data Scientist | Shield AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Early Growth-Stage Defense AI Equity + Mission Premium | $5B+ Private Valuation | Autonomy Analytics/Performance Modeling | Startup Intensity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego, CA | $145K-$195K | $70K-$210K | Discretionary | $180K-$300K |
| Washington, DC | $140K-$190K | $70K-$210K | Discretionary | $175K-$295K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Shield AI analyze autonomous drone performance data to improve Hivemind's capabilities. You work on problems that bridge traditional data science and robotics: modeling perception accuracy from flight test data, analyzing GPS-denied navigation performance, predicting autonomous system failures from telemetry, and building the metrics framework that quantifies Hivemind's autonomous capability level. Your analysis directly informs engineering decisions about where to invest development effort and helps the business quantify Hivemind's capability for DOD customers and contract proposals. Each analysis cycle feeds directly into the next Hivemind release, creating a tight loop between data insights and product improvement. [Source: Shield AI DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI DS = Google L4 DS = Waymo Autonomy DS -- with combat drone analytics and military customer quantification

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Autonomy Performance Analytics:** "I quantify Hivemind's autonomous capability -- analysis that directly determines Hivemind's competitive position and contract win rate."
- **Flight Test Analysis:** "I analyze real autonomous aircraft flight data. This is applied data science on the most consequential robotics platform in defense."
- **Military Customer Quantification:** "My analysis helps quantify Hivemind's capabilities for DOD customers. Data-driven capability claims win contracts."

**Global Levers**

1. **Capability Quantification:** "My analysis quantifies Hivemind's autonomous capability level -- data that directly drives contract proposals and wins."
2. **Flight Test Data Science:** "Analyzing real autonomous flight data is a unique data science domain. This skill set doesn't exist in commercial tech."
3. **$5B+ Earlier-Stage Equity:** "DS equity at $5B captures significant appreciation as Shield AI grows."
4. **Engineering Decision Influence:** "My analysis determines where Shield AI invests engineering effort. Data-driven prioritization multiplies engineering ROI."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I quantify Hivemind's autonomous capabilities from real flight test data -- analysis that directly wins contracts and determines engineering priorities. This autonomy data science domain is unique to companies like Shield AI. I'm targeting $195K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [FAANG] is $270K total comp for consumer data science. Shield AI's unique domain and equity trajectory must compensate." Accept at $165K+ equity.
