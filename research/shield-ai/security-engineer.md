**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Shield AI protect autonomous weapons systems that represent one of the most sensitive attack surfaces in defense. You secure the Hivemind autonomy stack against adversary manipulation, protect ground control communications against interception and jamming, ensure drone-to-drone swarm communications are secure, and maintain CMMC compliance across Shield AI's infrastructure. The threat model is extreme: nation-state adversaries actively attempt to hack, jam, spoof, or take control of autonomous drone systems. A successful attack could turn Shield AI's own weapons against friendly forces or compromise classified mission data. Security clearance is typically required.

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI Security Eng = Google L4-L5 Security = Anduril Security Eng -- with autonomous weapons focus and earlier-stage security program building

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Autonomous Weapons Security:** "I secure autonomous weapons against adversary takeover. A successful attack could turn drones against friendly forces -- the highest-consequence security work."
- **Anti-Jamming/Anti-Spoofing:** "I protect drone communications and navigation against electronic warfare. GPS-spoofing and comm-jamming are active battlefield threats."
- **Security Program Building:** "At Shield AI's stage, I'm building the security program, not just operating one. My decisions define security culture for years."

**Global Levers**

1. **Autonomous Weapons Anti-Hijack:** "Securing autonomous drones against adversary takeover is the most consequential security engineering in defense."
2. **Electronic Warfare Defense:** "I protect against GPS spoofing, comm jamming, and adversary manipulation. These are active battlefield threats, not theoretical risks."
3. **Security Program Building:** "At $5B, I'm building Shield AI's security program from the ground up. This founding contribution has lasting impact."
4. **Clearance + $5B Equity:** "Clearance constrains my career while $5B equity captures maximum appreciation potential."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I secure autonomous weapons against adversary takeover and electronic warfare -- the highest-consequence security work in defense. I'm building the security program from the ground up at a critical growth stage. I'm targeting $215K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Anduril] is $300K total comp with established security programs. Shield AI's earlier-stage equity and my security program building impact must compensate." Accept at $180K+ equity.
