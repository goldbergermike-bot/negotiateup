### Staff Software Engineer | Shield AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Early Growth-Stage Defense AI Equity + Mission Premium | $5B+ Private Valuation | AI-Powered Defense Drones | Startup Intensity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego, CA | $190K-$240K | $150K-$350K | Discretionary | $250K-$415K |
| Washington, DC | $185K-$235K | $150K-$350K | Discretionary | $245K-$410K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff SWEs at Shield AI are among the most senior technical leaders in the company. At this level, you define the architecture of the Hivemind autonomy stack, set engineering practices across the organization, and make technical decisions that determine Shield AI's competitive position against Anduril, General Atomics, and Boeing. Staff engineers at a $5B company have significantly more equity leverage than at larger companies -- your equity grant represents a meaningful ownership stake. You interface directly with the CEO (Ryan Tseng) and CTO on technical strategy. Shield AI's growth trajectory from $5B toward a potential IPO or $20B+ valuation makes Staff equity grants potentially career-defining. [Source: Shield AI Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI Staff SWE = Google L6 = Anduril Staff SWE -- with more concentrated ownership and earlier-stage upside

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Architectural Control:** "At Staff level in a $5B company, I define the technical architecture of the core product. My decisions set the foundation for the next decade."
- **Meaningful Ownership:** "Staff equity at $5B represents meaningful company ownership. My equity stake captures significant appreciation if Shield AI reaches $20B+."
- **CEO/CTO Interface:** "I work directly with leadership on technical strategy. At Shield AI's size, Staff engineers are the senior technical leadership team."

**Global Levers**

1. **Core Product Architecture:** "I architect Hivemind -- the product that IS Shield AI. My technical decisions determine the company's competitive position."
2. **$5B to $20B+ Equity Thesis:** "Staff equity at $5B valuation captures 4x potential appreciation. This is the most leveraged equity stage."
3. **Technical Leadership Scarcity:** "Staff-level autonomy architects are among the rarest engineers in defense tech."
4. **Competitive Positioning:** "My architecture determines whether Shield AI wins against Anduril, General Atomics, and Boeing for autonomous drone contracts."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I architect the Hivemind autonomy stack -- the core product that defines Shield AI's competitive position. Staff equity at $5B captures the most leveraged appreciation stage. I'm targeting $320K in equity over 4 years. My competing Staff offer from [Google/Anduril] is $450K total comp with more liquidity. Shield AI's $5B-to-$20B+ trajectory and my architectural control over the core product justify the equity." Accept at $275K+ equity.
