### DevOps Engineer | Shield AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Early Growth-Stage Defense AI Equity + Mission Premium | $5B+ Private Valuation | Autonomy CI/CD/Flight Software Infrastructure | Startup Intensity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego, CA | $140K-$190K | $65K-$195K | Discretionary | $175K-$290K |
| Washington, DC | $135K-$185K | $65K-$195K | Discretionary | $170K-$285K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Shield AI manage the infrastructure that supports autonomous drone development, testing, and deployment. This includes CI/CD pipelines for flight-critical software (where bad deployments could crash aircraft), simulation infrastructure running millions of virtual flights, flight test data processing systems, and deployment to edge computing on aircraft platforms. DevOps at Shield AI spans cloud infrastructure, on-premise simulation clusters, and embedded deployment to drone hardware with severe SWaP (size, weight, power) constraints. The deployment pipeline must handle classified code, meet defense compliance requirements, and ensure flight-critical software quality. [Source: Shield AI DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI DevOps = Google L4 SRE = Waymo DevOps -- with flight-critical deployment and embedded systems

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Flight-Critical CI/CD:** "My deployment pipeline delivers software to autonomous aircraft. Bad deployments crash real drones -- the highest-consequence CI/CD in the industry."
- **Simulation Infrastructure:** "I manage simulation clusters running millions of virtual flights. Simulation throughput directly determines autonomy development speed."
- **Multi-Domain Infrastructure:** "Cloud + simulation + embedded aircraft -- I manage infrastructure across three completely different domains."

**Global Levers**

1. **Flight-Critical Deployment:** "My CI/CD pipeline deploys to aircraft. Deployment quality directly impacts flight safety."
2. **Simulation Infrastructure = Development Speed:** "Simulation throughput determines how fast Shield AI can iterate on Hivemind. My infrastructure is the bottleneck or enabler."
3. **$5B+ Earlier-Stage Equity:** "DevOps equity at $5B captures significant appreciation potential."
4. **Embedded + Cloud Infrastructure:** "Managing infrastructure spanning cloud, simulation, and embedded aircraft systems is rare and valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage flight-critical deployment pipelines and simulation infrastructure that directly determines Hivemind's development speed. Bad deployments crash real aircraft -- the highest-consequence CI/CD in tech. I'm targeting $180K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [FAANG] is $260K total comp for cloud-only DevOps. Shield AI's flight-critical infrastructure and equity trajectory must compensate." Accept at $150K+ equity.

**Evidence & Sources**
- [Shield AI DevOps Comp -- Levels.fyi 2025-2026]
- [Flight-Critical CI/CD -- Autonomous Aircraft Deployment]
- [Simulation Infrastructure -- Virtual Flight Testing at Scale]
- [Shield AI $5B+ Valuation -- Earlier-Stage Equity]
