### Software Engineer | Shield AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Early Growth-Stage Defense AI Equity + Mission Premium | $5B+ Private Valuation | AI-Powered Defense Drones | Startup Intensity

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Diego, CA | $140K-$195K | $60K-$200K | Discretionary | $175K-$300K |
| Washington, DC | $135K-$190K | $60K-$200K | Discretionary | $170K-$295K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Shield AI builds AI pilots for unmanned aircraft -- the Hivemind autonomy stack that enables drones to fly without GPS, without communications, and without human intervention. SWEs work across the full stack: flight software, ground control systems, mission planning tools, simulation infrastructure, and data pipelines. Shield AI is valued at $5B+ and is the leading pure-play autonomous combat drone company. The company is earlier-stage than Anduril or SpaceX, meaning more risk but potentially more equity upside. Base salaries are competitive with mid-tier San Diego tech but below FAANG; the equity thesis rests on the DOD's massive investment in autonomous systems. Bonuses are discretionary, not guaranteed. The culture is startup-intense with defense mission motivation. [Source: Shield AI SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Shield AI SWE = Google L3-L4 = Mid-tier defense tech startup SWE -- with autonomy domain and clearance potential

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Earlier-Stage Equity Upside:** "Shield AI at $5B is earlier-stage than Anduril ($14B) or SpaceX ($180B). My equity captures more potential upside per dollar invested."
- **Autonomous Combat Systems:** "I write software for autonomous combat aircraft. This is the most consequential software domain in defense."
- **San Diego Cost of Living:** "San Diego is more affordable than SF or LA. My effective purchasing power is higher, but my base should still reflect technical market rates."

**Global Levers**

1. **$5B+ Growth Trajectory:** "Shield AI is on a rapid growth trajectory as the DOD invests heavily in autonomous systems. Early equity captures the most upside."
2. **Combat-Tested Platform:** "Hivemind is one of the few AI systems battle-tested in real operations. I'm building on a validated platform, reducing technical risk."
3. **DOD Autonomous Investment:** "The DOD's $50B+ autonomous systems investment creates a massive TAM for Shield AI."
4. **Earlier-Stage = More Upside:** "At $5B, there's significantly more room for equity appreciation compared to later-stage defense tech."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Shield AI's $5B valuation offers earlier-stage equity upside than Anduril or SpaceX. I'm building autonomous combat systems on a battle-tested platform. I'm targeting $185K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [Anduril/FAANG] is $240K total comp. Shield AI's earlier-stage equity upside and the DOD autonomous pivot must bridge the gap." Accept at $155K+ equity.
