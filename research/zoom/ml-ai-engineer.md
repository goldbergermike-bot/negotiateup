### ML/AI Engineer | Zoom Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Real-time communication AI specialist | Speech/NLP/video intelligence systems | **AI/ML PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Zoom build the machine learning models and systems that power the AI Companion, real-time transcription, noise cancellation, virtual backgrounds, gesture recognition, meeting summarization, and a growing suite of AI-powered features across the Zoom platform. The technical domain is rich — spanning speech recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, and audio signal processing — all constrained by the requirement for real-time performance during live communication. This creates ML engineering challenges that are genuinely distinctive from batch-processing ML roles.

Zoom compensates ML/AI Engineers at premium levels, typically 15-25% above standard SWE bands. The company has been aggressively expanding its AI/ML team since 2023, competing directly with Google, Microsoft, and Apple for engineers who can build production speech and language models. Zoom's federated AI architecture — integrating multiple LLM providers with custom models — means ML engineers need both model development skills and systems engineering proficiency.

The unique appeal of ML engineering at Zoom is the immediate, tangible impact. When you improve a transcription model, hundreds of millions of users immediately benefit. When you optimize meeting summarization, enterprises reduce hours of wasted follow-up time. The feedback loop between model improvement and user impact is shorter and more visible than at most companies.

**Zoom Communication AI Premium**
ML/AI Engineers with expertise in speech and audio ML — automatic speech recognition (ASR), speaker diarization, noise suppression, audio enhancement — have the strongest negotiating position at Zoom. These skills are directly applicable to Zoom's core product experience and are relatively rare in the ML talent market, where most engineers focus on vision or text-only NLP. If you've built production speech models, audio processing ML systems, or real-time NLP pipelines, your skills command a significant premium.

Engineers with experience in multimodal AI — combining audio, video, and text signals to understand meeting context — are in growing demand as Zoom builds more sophisticated AI Companion features. The ability to build models that jointly reason across communication modalities positions you for Zoom's most advanced AI initiatives.

**Global Levers**
1. **Speech/Audio ML Expertise:** "I bring specialized expertise in [ASR/speaker diarization/audio ML/noise suppression] that directly powers Zoom's core communication AI features. Engineers with production speech ML experience are rare and in exceptional demand."
2. **Real-Time ML Deployment:** "My experience deploying ML models for real-time inference — with strict latency constraints — directly addresses Zoom's requirement for AI features that operate seamlessly during live meetings."
3. **Multimodal AI Capability:** "I bring experience building models that combine [audio/video/text] signals. Zoom's next-generation AI Companion features require multimodal understanding, and this skillset positions me for Zoom's most advanced AI work."
4. **AI Talent Premium:** "ML/AI engineers with communication AI expertise command a market premium of 20-30% over standard SWE roles. My competing offers at [Google/Microsoft/Apple] reflect this premium, and I'd like Zoom's offer to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my expertise in [speech ML/real-time NLP/communication AI], I'm targeting total compensation of $355K. ML engineers who can build production communication AI features with real-time latency constraints are among the most in-demand profiles in tech. My floor is $325K in total comp. I strongly prefer a heavy RSU allocation — Zoom's AI Companion is the primary stock price catalyst — and a sign-on bonus of $35K-$50K to offset unvested equity at my current role."
