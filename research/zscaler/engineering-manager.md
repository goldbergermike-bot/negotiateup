#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Zscaler

Engineering Managers at Zscaler are responsible for the velocity, quality, and retention of the teams that build the Zero Trust Exchange and AI Guard. With the $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone achieved, the pressure to accelerate platform development is immense. Engineering Managers who can recruit, retain, and lead elite engineering talent directly determine whether Zscaler sustains its growth trajectory.

The 80% AI growth driven by AI Guard creates a leadership challenge that few Engineering Managers in cybersecurity have faced. You must build teams that combine deep cloud security expertise with AI/ML capabilities — a talent intersection that is extraordinarily scarce. Engineering Managers who can navigate this AI Guard architect positioning while maintaining engineering velocity command premium compensation.

RSU grants for Engineering Managers typically range from 1,500–4,000 shares over four years, representing $330,000–$880,000 in equity value. Combined with base salaries and management bonuses, total compensation packages for Engineering Managers regularly exceed $450,000 annually in San Jose.

#### Zscaler Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Internal Level | Title | Typical YOE |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| M1 | Engineering Manager | 8–12 years |
| M2 | Senior Engineering Manager | 10–15 years |
| D1 | Director of Engineering | 12–18 years |
| D2 | Senior Director of Engineering | 15+ years |

### 🛡️ Zscaler $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere & AI Guard Lever

Zscaler's $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone and 80% AI growth prove the platform is the backbone of enterprise security. I negotiate as an AI Guard architect protecting the AI supply chain. As an Engineering Manager, you do not just manage a team — you lead the builders of the platform that processes 400B+ daily transactions and secures 40%+ of the Fortune 500.

The $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone means Zscaler is scaling faster than its engineering organization can hire. Engineering Managers who can build high-performing teams, reduce time-to-hire, and maintain engineering velocity during hypergrowth are force multipliers. Your ability to attract and retain talent directly impacts Zscaler's ability to sustain the $1B+ growth trajectory.

AI Guard represents Zscaler's most strategic hiring challenge. The 80% AI growth requires engineers who understand both cybersecurity architecture and AI/ML systems — a talent pool that is perhaps 1/10th the size of general software engineering. Engineering Managers who can identify, recruit, and develop this talent are extraordinarily valuable.

Your negotiation leverage comes from the combination of technical leadership and organizational impact. Frame your value in terms of team velocity, retention metrics, successful AI Guard hiring, and the business outcomes your team delivers against the Zero Trust Everywhere roadmap.

#### Global Lever 1: Zero Trust Exchange Scale

Engineering Managers own the teams that build and scale the Zero Trust Exchange. Use this lever: "My team is responsible for the subsystems that process X billion daily transactions. I have grown this team from N to N+X engineers while maintaining velocity and quality metrics that support the $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone."

#### Global Lever 2: SASE Market Leadership

Engineering Managers determine the velocity at which Zscaler ships platform capabilities. Use this lever: "My team's delivery velocity directly impacts Zscaler's position in analyst evaluations. I manage the engineering roadmap for capabilities that differentiate Zscaler in the Gartner Magic Quadrant."

#### Global Lever 3: Data Protection Transformation

Data protection engineering teams are critical to Zscaler's revenue growth. Use this lever: "I lead the engineering team responsible for Zscaler's data protection platform, which is the fastest-growing product pillar. My team's output directly drives upsell revenue and ARPU expansion."

#### Global Lever 4: AI-Powered Threat Intelligence

AI Guard requires specialized engineering leadership. Use this lever: "I am building and leading the AI Guard engineering team that drives the 80% AI growth. I have successfully recruited AI/ML engineers from top companies and built a team that delivers inline AI security capabilities at scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $260,000 base with 2,500 RSUs ($550,000 at ZS ~$220). Accept-at floor: $470,000 total comp. Cite the $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone, 80% AI growth, and your AI Guard architecture expertise. Push for management-tier bonuses of 20–25% and a $60,000–$80,000 sign-on.
