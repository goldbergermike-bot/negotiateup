#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Zscaler

Security Engineers at Zscaler have a unique position: they secure the platform that secures the world's largest enterprises. The Zero Trust Exchange processes 400B+ daily transactions, and every one of those transactions must be inspected, classified, and secured without introducing latency or vulnerability. The $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone reflects enterprise trust in Zscaler's security posture — trust that Security Engineers build and maintain.

The 80% AI growth driven by AI Guard creates new security challenges that did not exist two years ago. How do you secure an AI supply chain? How do you protect ML model integrity? How do you detect adversarial attacks against AI inference endpoints? Security Engineers who can answer these questions — who can serve as AI Guard architects protecting the AI security perimeter — are the most strategically valuable security professionals in the industry.

RSU grants for Security Engineers typically range from 900–2,800 shares over four years. With ZS trading above $200, these grants represent $198,000–$616,000 in equity value. Security Engineers should negotiate for top-of-band RSU grants by demonstrating their direct impact on platform security posture and AI Guard security architecture.

### 🛡️ Zscaler $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere & AI Guard Lever

Zscaler's $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone and 80% AI growth prove the platform is the backbone of enterprise security. I negotiate as an AI Guard architect protecting the AI supply chain. As a Security Engineer, you are the defender of the defenders — ensuring that the Zero Trust Exchange is hardened against nation-state threats, zero-day exploits, and advanced persistent threats while maintaining the performance that enterprise customers demand.

The $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone means Zscaler's attack surface is growing proportionally. More customers, more data centers, more integrations — each creating new vectors that adversaries will attempt to exploit. Security Engineers who can threat-model at this scale, build defensive architectures that anticipate nation-state attacks, and maintain the security certifications (FedRAMP, SOC2, ISO 27001) that enterprise customers require are indispensable.

AI Guard introduces entirely new security domains. The 80% AI growth means Zscaler must secure AI model serving infrastructure, protect ML training pipelines from data poisoning, validate AI inference outputs for adversarial manipulation, and ensure that AI Guard itself is not a vector for attack. Security Engineers who can architect security for AI systems are at the absolute frontier of the field.

Your negotiation leverage is amplified by the trust asymmetry in cybersecurity — enterprises pay Zscaler to be secure, and Security Engineers are the foundation of that trust. Frame every compensation discussion around threat landscape complexity, AI Guard security architecture, and the $1B+ revenue at risk if platform security is compromised.

#### Global Lever 1: Zero Trust Exchange Scale

Security Engineers protect a platform processing 400B+ daily transactions. Use this lever: "I secure the Zero Trust Exchange against nation-state threats and advanced persistent threats at a scale of 400B+ daily transactions. My security architecture directly protects the $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere revenue stream."

#### Global Lever 2: SASE Market Leadership

Security certifications and compliance are prerequisites for enterprise adoption. Use this lever: "I maintain and expand the security certifications — FedRAMP, SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA — that enable Zscaler to sell to regulated industries. My compliance work directly opens market segments worth hundreds of millions in ARR."

#### Global Lever 3: Data Protection Transformation

Security Engineers ensure data protection features are themselves secure. Use this lever: "I architect the security controls that protect Zscaler's DLP, CASB, and data classification systems. My work ensures that the data protection platform is itself protected against attacks that could expose customer data."

#### Global Lever 4: AI-Powered Threat Intelligence

AI Guard security is the newest frontier. Use this lever: "I architect the security posture of AI Guard — protecting ML models from adversarial attacks, securing AI inference pipelines, and ensuring AI data protection mechanisms cannot be bypassed. My work directly supports the 80% AI growth by building the security foundation that enterprises require before deploying AI Guard."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $235,000 base with 1,600 RSUs ($352,000 at ZS ~$220). Accept-at floor: $430,000 total comp. Cite the $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone, 80% AI growth, and your AI Guard architecture expertise. Push for security-track equity premiums and threat research budget allocation.
