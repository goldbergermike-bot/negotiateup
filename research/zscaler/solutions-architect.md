#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Zscaler

Solutions Architects at Zscaler are the technical face of the company to its most strategic customers. The $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone was achieved in part because Solutions Architects designed deployment architectures that delivered rapid time-to-value for enterprise customers. You translate platform capabilities into customer outcomes — and every successful deployment drives expansion revenue, renewals, and net retention.

The 80% AI growth driven by AI Guard creates a new category of customer engagement. Solutions Architects who can design AI Guard deployment architectures, advise CISOs on AI security strategy, and position Zscaler's AI capabilities against competitors are the most valuable pre-sales and post-sales technologists in cybersecurity. This AI Guard architect positioning is your primary negotiation lever.

RSU grants for Solutions Architects typically range from 800–2,500 shares over four years. Many Solutions Architects also earn variable compensation tied to territory performance, making total compensation highly leveraged. Negotiate for both strong RSU grants and favorable variable compensation structures.
