#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Zscaler

Product Managers at Zscaler own the strategy and roadmap for products that protect the world's largest enterprises. The $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone was not achieved by engineering alone — it required Product Managers who could identify market opportunities, prioritize features, and translate customer needs into platform capabilities that drive revenue. At Zscaler, PMs own outcomes, not outputs.

The 80% AI growth driven by AI Guard creates an unprecedented product management opportunity. PMs who can define the AI Guard product strategy — balancing inline AI security, data protection for AI workloads, and AI-powered threat intelligence — are shaping a product category that did not exist two years ago. This AI Guard architect positioning extends to product strategy, not just engineering.

RSU grants for Product Managers typically range from 1,000–3,000 shares over four years. With ZS trading above $200, these grants represent $220,000–$660,000 in equity value. PMs should negotiate for top-of-band RSU grants by demonstrating direct revenue impact and AI Guard product vision.
