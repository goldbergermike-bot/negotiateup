#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Zscaler

Product Designers at Zscaler solve one of the hardest UX challenges in enterprise software: making a platform that processes 400B+ daily security transactions intuitive for security operations teams. The $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone means Zscaler's user base is expanding rapidly — from security architects to business administrators, from SOC analysts to CISOs. Each persona requires a different design paradigm, and designers who can navigate this complexity are rare.

The 80% AI growth driven by AI Guard creates entirely new design challenges. How do you visualize AI threat detection in real time? How do you design policy controls for AI data protection that non-technical administrators can configure? How do you surface AI Guard insights in a way that drives action? Product Designers who solve these AI Guard design challenges are architects of the user experience that drives adoption and retention.

RSU grants for Product Designers typically range from 600–2,000 shares over four years. With ZS trading above $200, these grants represent $132,000–$440,000 in equity value. Designers should negotiate RSU packages by demonstrating their impact on user adoption, retention, and NPS metrics.

### 🛡️ Zscaler $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere & AI Guard Lever

Zscaler's $1B+ Zero Trust Everywhere milestone and 80% AI growth prove the platform is the backbone of enterprise security. I negotiate as an AI Guard architect protecting the AI supply chain. As a Product Designer, you define the user experience that determines whether enterprises successfully adopt and expand their Zscaler deployments. The $1B+ milestone was achieved in part because designers created interfaces that reduced time-to-value for enterprise customers.

The Zero Trust Everywhere vision requires design that scales across personas, industries, and geographies. Product Designers must create experiences that work for a 10-person security team at a mid-market company and a 500-person SOC at a global bank. This design complexity is unique to Zscaler's position as the dominant Zero Trust platform.

AI Guard introduces design challenges that have no precedent. The 80% AI growth means Zscaler is building entirely new product surfaces for AI security — from AI data flow visualization to AI policy configuration to AI threat dashboards. Designers who can create these experiences from scratch are defining a new category of security UX.

Leverage your design impact on platform adoption, customer satisfaction, and the AI Guard user experience to command premium compensation at Zscaler.
