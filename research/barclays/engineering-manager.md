**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Barclays lead teams across the bank's UK and US operations spanning retail banking, investment banking, and technology platforms. EMs (SVP or Director titles) must navigate UK work culture, cross-Atlantic team dynamics, and financial services regulatory requirements. Barclays' EM compensation in NYC is competitive with US banks; London and Glasgow roles offer strong packages with UK employment protections and benefits.
