TPMs (SVP or Director titles) manage programs including platform modernization, regulatory technology implementations (Open Banking, PRA resilience), and cross-border infrastructure upgrades.

**Level Mapping:** TPM at Barclays (SVP/Director) = L5-L6 TPM at Google, E5-E6 TPM at Meta, Sr TPM-Principal TPM at Amazon, SVP/Director TPM at BofA

**The UK Banking Program Premium**

TPMs at Barclays manage programs that must satisfy UK regulatory requirements (FCA, PRA) alongside US and international mandates. This multi-jurisdiction program management complexity provides career-differentiating experience.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Amazon/HSBC] at [X] total comp."
2. **UK Regulatory Program Expertise:** "My experience managing [UK banking/FCA-regulated/PRA resilience] programs is directly applicable."
3. **Program Scale:** "Managing programs across UK and US with multi-jurisdiction compliance warrants Director-level compensation."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A sign-on would bridge my unvested compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I have a competing offer at [Z]K total comp. To choose Barclays, I'd need the base increased, guaranteed bonus, and a sign-on. Below [floor], I'd need to reconsider."
