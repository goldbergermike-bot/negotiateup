**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Barclays protect banking infrastructure across the UK and global operations against sophisticated threat actors. Barclays' security challenges include compliance with PRA operational resilience requirements, UK NCSC guidance, FCA technology standards, and international cybersecurity regulations. The multi-jurisdiction regulatory environment creates security engineering complexity that justifies premium compensation.
