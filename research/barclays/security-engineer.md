**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Barclays protect banking infrastructure across the UK and global operations against sophisticated threat actors. Barclays' security challenges include compliance with PRA operational resilience requirements, UK NCSC guidance, FCA technology standards, and international cybersecurity regulations. The multi-jurisdiction regulatory environment creates security engineering complexity that justifies premium compensation.

**The UK Financial Security Premium**

UK banks face sophisticated nation-state and cybercrime threats, and Barclays' security team must satisfy some of the world's strictest financial security regulations (PRA, FCA, NCSC). Security engineers with UK banking security experience are in exceptional demand.

3. **Multi-Jurisdiction Security:** "Defending banking infrastructure across UK, US, and European regulatory environments is uniquely complex."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A sign-on would offset my unvested compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I have a competing offer at [Z]K total comp. To choose Barclays, I'd need the base increased, guaranteed bonus, and a sign-on. Below [floor], I'd need to reconsider."
