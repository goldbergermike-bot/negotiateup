### Product Designer | Barclays Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** GBP35B market cap UK bank + Design for UK/US banking products + London/NYC dual hub + Competing with neobanks on design quality | Barclays design must compete with Monzo/Revolut UX | **UK BANKING DESIGN PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $120K–$168K | $28K–$68K/yr | 15–22% | $155K–$242K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Barclays shape the user experience for UK retail banking, Barclaycard, and the Barclays app -- competing directly with UK neobanks (Monzo, Revolut, Starling) that have set the global standard for banking UX. The BX digital platform team has been investing in design quality and recruiting designers from tech companies and neobanks to elevate the experience.

**The Neobank Competition Design Premium**

Barclays' design team operates under competitive pressure from UK neobanks that have won design awards and set user expectations for banking UX. Designers who can bring neobank-quality UX thinking to a major bank's scale are in high demand.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Monzo/Revolut/Google] at [X] total comp."
2. **Neobank-Quality Design:** "My experience designing [fintech/mobile banking] experiences that compete with neobanks is directly applicable."
3. **Digital Engagement Impact:** "My design work impacts engagement for millions of UK and US customers."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A sign-on would offset my unvested equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I have a competing offer at [Z]K total comp. To choose Barclays, I'd need the base increased and a sign-on. Below [floor], I'd need to reconsider."
