Product Designers at Barclays shape the user experience for UK retail banking, Barclaycard, and the Barclays app -- competing directly with UK neobanks (Monzo, Revolut, Starling) that have set the global standard for banking UX. The BX digital platform team has been investing in design quality and recruiting designers from tech companies and neobanks to elevate the experience.
