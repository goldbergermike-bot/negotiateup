### Data Scientist | Barclays Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** GBP35B market cap UK bank + Quant/DS across trading, risk, and consumer analytics + London/NYC dual hub + Competitive in quant/tech | Barclays DS spans UK banking and global markets | **UK QUANT ANALYTICS PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| New York City | $142K–$202K | $40K–$108K/yr | 18–28% | $192K–$320K |
| London (HQ) | £98K–£148K | £30K–£78K/yr | 18–28% | £132K–£235K |
| Glasgow | £78K–£118K | £22K–£55K/yr | 18–28% | £105K–£178K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Barclays apply quantitative modeling across investment banking, Barclaycard credit risk, UK retail banking analytics, and wealth management. Barclays' investment banking (formerly Barclays Capital) has a strong quantitative tradition, and DS roles in the investment bank are among the highest-compensated positions. The bank's UK consumer business creates unique DS challenges around FCA-compliant credit models and Open Banking analytics.

**Level Mapping:** Data Scientist at Barclays (VP/SVP) = L4-L5 at Google, IC4-IC5 at Meta, Applied Scientist at Amazon, VP/SVP at BofA, VP/ED at Goldman Sachs

**The UK Quant Finance Premium**

Barclays' quantitative heritage (from the Barclays Capital era) creates a strong quantitative culture, particularly in the investment bank. Data scientists with experience in UK credit modeling, FCA-compliant analytics, or investment banking quantitative analysis command premium compensation. London's position as a global quant finance hub means Barclays competes with hedge funds, prop trading firms, and other banks for top DS talent.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Two Sigma/Goldman Sachs/Google] at [X] total comp. I'm drawn to Barclays' quant challenges, but the compensation gap is significant."
2. **Quantitative Expertise:** "My PhD/expertise in [quantitative finance/credit modeling/machine learning] commands [X] at quant funds."
3. **UK Regulatory Modeling:** "My experience with [FCA-compliant models/UK credit risk/PRA stress testing] is directly applicable and scarce."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have [X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about Barclays' quantitative challenges. I have a competing offer at [Z]K total comp. To choose Barclays, I'd need the base increased, guaranteed bonus, and a sign-on. Below [floor], the competing offer is more compelling."
