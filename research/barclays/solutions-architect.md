**The UK Banking Architecture Premium**

Barclays' architecture must accommodate UK-specific requirements including Open Banking API standards, PRA operational resilience, and FCA technology mandates, alongside global investment banking infrastructure needs. This multi-domain architecture experience is rare and valuable.

**Global Levers**
