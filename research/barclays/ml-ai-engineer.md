**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Barclays deploy machine learning across investment banking analytics, Barclaycard credit risk, fraud detection, and customer personalization. The bank's UK heritage creates unique ML challenges including FCA-compliant AI, UK GDPR algorithmic requirements, and the emerging UK AI regulatory framework. Barclays' investment banking quantitative tradition means ML engineers in the investment bank earn particularly competitive packages.

**The UK Financial AI Premium**

Barclays' ML engineers must navigate UK-specific AI governance, including the FCA's AI and data ethics framework, the UK's emerging AI regulation, and PRA model risk management requirements. This UK regulatory AI expertise is increasingly valuable as other jurisdictions adopt similar frameworks.

**Global Levers**

2. **UK AI Regulatory Expertise:** "My experience with [FCA AI governance/UK model risk/GDPR ML] is directly applicable."
3. **Revenue Impact:** "ML models in trading and credit risk directly impact Barclays' P&L."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have [X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I have a competing offer at [Z]K total comp. To choose Barclays, I'd need the base increased, guaranteed bonus, and a sign-on. Below [floor], I'd need to reconsider."
