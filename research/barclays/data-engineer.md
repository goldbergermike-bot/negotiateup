### Data Engineer | Barclays Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** GBP35B market cap UK bank + Data infrastructure across UK/US/global operations + London/NYC dual hub + Competitive in quant/tech | Barclays data engineering spans UK and global banking | **UK BANKING DATA PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock/Bonus | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Barclays build data infrastructure across consumer banking (Barclaycard, UK retail), investment banking, and wealth management. The bank's UK heritage creates unique data challenges including FCA reporting requirements, UK GDPR compliance, and Open Banking API data standards. NYC-based roles earn US-competitive compensation while providing UK/European regulatory data expertise.

**Level Mapping:** Data Engineer at Barclays (VP) = L4-L5 at Google, E4-E5 at Meta, SDE II-Senior at Amazon, VP at BofA, Senior DE at Capital One

**The UK Regulatory Data Premium**

Barclays' data engineering involves UK-specific regulatory requirements (FCA, PRA, Open Banking) alongside European and US mandates. Data engineers with experience in UK banking data platforms and Open Banking API standards are in particular demand. The Glasgow tech hub offers strong compensation relative to local cost of living.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [HSBC/Snowflake/Capital One] at [X] total comp. I'm interested in Barclays' data challenges, but the compensation needs to be competitive."
2. **UK Regulatory Data Expertise:** "My experience with [FCA reporting/Open Banking/UK GDPR] data platforms is directly applicable and scarce."
3. **Cross-Border Data Complexity:** "Building data infrastructure across UK, US, and European jurisdictions is uniquely complex."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "I have [X]K in unvested compensation. A sign-on would make the transition viable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about Barclays' data modernization. I have a competing offer at [Z]K total comp. To choose Barclays, I'd need the base increased, guaranteed first-year bonus, and a sign-on. Below [floor], I'd need to reconsider."
