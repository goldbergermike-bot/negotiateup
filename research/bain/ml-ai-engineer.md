### ML/AI Engineer | Bain Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (30-50%) | No Equity | PE-Adjacent AI Delivery

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boston | $175K-$225K | None | $53K-$113K (30-50%) | $228K-$338K |
| New York | $180K-$235K | None | $54K-$118K (30-50%) | $234K-$353K |
| London | £115K-£160K | None | £35K-£80K (30-50%) | £150K-£240K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Bain build production ML models for PE due diligence, client consulting engagements, and internal analytics tools. Bain's Advanced Analytics Group has been rapidly expanding its AI capabilities, particularly in areas that support the firm's PE practice — predictive deal analytics, portfolio company optimization, and AI-powered market analysis. ML/AI engineers who can deploy production AI systems for PE use cases command a premium. Bain does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (30-50%). The firm competes for ML talent with both FAANG companies and PE/hedge funds, which has pushed compensation upward. [Source: Bain Advanced Analytics AI Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Bain ML/AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta E4-E5 ML = Two Sigma ML Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **PE AI Applications:** "My ML models support PE due diligence and portfolio company optimization. The financial impact of accurate AI predictions in PE is measured in hundreds of millions."
2. **Production ML Scarcity:** "Engineers who can take ML models to production in high-stakes PE environments are exceptionally rare. This specialized skill set commands a significant premium."
3. **AI Company Competition:** "ML engineers at OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google earn $350K-$550K TC with equity. Bain needs competitive cash comp to attract from this talent pool."
4. **Bain Capital AI Strategy:** "Bain Capital is investing heavily in AI-powered investment analysis. ML engineers with Bain consulting experience are natural hires for the fund — creating exit optionality that should be priced into current comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "My production ML expertise directly supports Bain's PE analytics — the firm's highest-margin practice. I need $225K base with a 35% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $35K signing bonus. AI company alternatives offer $370K-$450K TC with equity." Bain will counter at $200K-$215K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $310K.
