**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Bain design the technical architecture for client engagements and the firm's internal analytics platforms. SAs at Bain often work on technology transformation projects for PE portfolio companies — designing the target architecture for companies undergoing operational improvement. This PE portfolio connection is unique to Bain and creates a direct line between your architecture work and investment outcomes worth billions. Bain does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (30-50%). SAs supporting PE portfolio transformations earn at the top of the bonus range.

**Level Mapping:** Bain Solutions Architect = AWS Senior SA = Google Cloud Customer Engineer (L5) = McKinsey Solutions Architect

**Global Levers**

1. **PE Portfolio Transformation:** "I design target architectures for PE portfolio companies undergoing value creation. My architecture decisions directly impact the investment returns for Bain Capital and other PE clients."
2. **Client Revenue Enablement:** "My architecture work enables Bain to sell and deliver $5M-$20M implementation engagements. I'm the technical credibility that converts consulting strategy into delivered solutions."
3. **Consulting Partner Equivalence:** "SAs at Bain operate at the same client-facing level as Principals. My comp should reflect this client interaction and strategic influence."
4. **Cross-Fund Architecture Experience:** "Working across multiple PE portfolio companies gives me architecture experience across industries that's nearly impossible to get elsewhere. This breadth has significant market value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm designing architectures for PE portfolio company transformations — work that directly impacts billion-dollar investments. I need $230K base with a 35% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $40K signing bonus. Cloud provider SA roles offer $300K-$400K TC with equity." Bain will counter at $210K-$220K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $325K.
