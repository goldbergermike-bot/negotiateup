**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Bain protect the firm's most sensitive asset: confidential PE deal data and client strategy information. Bain handles material non-public information for PE due diligence, making security breaches not just a reputation risk but a potential legal and regulatory catastrophe. Security engineers also ensure that Bain's analytics platforms meet the stringent security requirements of PE funds and financial regulators. Bain does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (25-45%). The firm has increased security investment significantly as AI deployments and PE data volumes create new attack surfaces.

**Level Mapping:** Bain Security Engineer = Google L4 Security = Amazon Security Engineer II = CrowdStrike Senior SecEng

**Global Levers**

1. **PE Data Confidentiality:** "Bain handles material non-public information for PE due diligence. A security breach could trigger SEC investigations and destroy client relationships worth billions in fees."
2. **Regulatory Compliance Stakes:** "PE advisory work is subject to stringent financial regulations. My security work ensures Bain meets compliance requirements that are far more demanding than typical tech companies."
3. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers are the scarcest talent in tech. Financial services and PE-adjacent security engineers command an additional premium."
4. **AI Security Requirements:** "Bain's AI analytics platforms introduce new security vectors. Security engineers with AI and financial data expertise are exceptionally rare."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm protecting the PE deal data that Bain's entire advisory practice depends on — data that carries legal and regulatory consequences if compromised. I need $205K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $30K signing bonus. Security talent is exceptionally scarce, and my alternatives offer $280K-$360K TC." Bain will counter at $185K-$195K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $270K.
