### Engineering Manager | Bain Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (30-50%) | No Equity | Analytics-Focused Tech Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boston | $200K-$245K | None | $60K-$123K (30-50%) | $260K-$368K |
| New York | $205K-$255K | None | $62K-$128K (30-50%) | $267K-$383K |
| London | £130K-£170K | None | £39K-£85K (30-50%) | £169K-£255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Bain lead teams building the firm's analytics platforms, PE due diligence tools, and technology infrastructure. The Bain EM role carries significant weight because the technology organization is smaller — each manager's team represents a larger percentage of the firm's technical capability. You'll manage engineers while navigating Bain's partnership culture, where senior partners sponsor technology investments and expect regular updates on platform capabilities. Bain does not offer equity; bonus at this level ranges 30-50%, with EMs supporting PE advisory work earning at the top. Bain has been hiring experienced tech leaders from FAANG to professionalize its engineering management layer. [Source: Bain Technology Engineering Management 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Bain Engineering Manager = Google L6 EM = Meta E6 EM = Amazon SDM II

**Global Levers**

1. **Consulting Parity Frame:** "Engineering Managers at Bain are equivalent to Managers/Principals on the consulting track ($300K-$500K TC). Both lead teams and deliver outcomes. My comp should approach parity."
2. **PE Practice Enablement:** "My team builds the analytics platforms that power Bain's $3B+ PE advisory practice. My team's productivity directly impacts deal throughput and PE client retention."
3. **Small Org, Big Responsibility:** "At Bain, each engineering team represents a larger share of total tech capacity than at McKinsey or BCG. My management decisions have proportionally greater firm-wide impact."
4. **FAANG EM Comp Benchmark:** "EMs at Google, Meta, and Amazon earn $380K-$500K TC with equity. Bain needs to offer competitive cash comp to attract experienced engineering leadership."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm leading engineering teams that build Bain's PE analytics infrastructure. I need $245K base with a 35% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $45K signing bonus. My FAANG offers are at $400K-$480K TC." Bain will counter at $220K-$235K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $340K.
