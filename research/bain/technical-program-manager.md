**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Bain coordinate complex engineering programs — platform launches, analytics infrastructure upgrades, security overhauls, and PE tool deployments. Bain's TPM role requires managing programs that align with PE deal timelines and consulting partner expectations. The smaller technology organization means each TPM owns a larger share of the firm's critical programs. Bain does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (25-45%). TPMs who deliver programs on PE deal timelines earn bonuses at the top of the range. [Source: Bain Technology Program Management 2025-2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **PE-Driven Delivery Pressure:** "My programs must align with PE deal timelines — hard deadlines that don't flex. This delivery pressure exceeds typical tech company program management."
2. **Cross-Functional Leadership:** "I coordinate engineering, analytics, consulting partners, and PE clients. This multi-stakeholder complexity warrants premium comp."
3. **Small Team, Big Programs:** "Bain's TPM team is lean, which means I own larger, more complex programs than I would at McKinsey or BCG. More scope should mean more comp."
4. **No-Equity Market Adjustment:** "TPMs at FAANG earn $280K-$400K TC with equity. Bain needs competitive cash comp for experienced program managers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm driving delivery of Bain's critical technology programs on PE deal timelines. I need $210K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $30K signing bonus. My tech alternatives offer $300K-$370K TC with equity." Bain will counter at $185K-$200K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $280K.
