**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Bain build the internal technology platforms, analytics tools, and AI-powered products that support the firm's consulting practice — particularly its industry-leading PE advisory work. Bain is the smallest of the MBB firms but has the strongest PE practice, meaning its technology investments are heavily concentrated in analytics and due diligence tools. Bain does not offer equity to non-partner employees; total comp is base + performance bonus (25-50%). Bain's technology organization is smaller and more focused than McKinsey's or BCG's, which means individual engineers have outsized impact — and more visibility with firm leadership.

**Global Levers**

1. **No-Equity Compensation Frame:** "My tech alternatives offer $100K-$200K in equity over 4 years. Since Bain doesn't offer equity, I need the base to compensate for this structural gap."
2. **PE Practice Revenue Enablement:** "Bain's PE advisory is a $3B+ revenue engine. The tools I build directly support the due diligence process that wins and retains PE clients."
3. **Small Team, Big Impact:** "Bain's technology org is smaller than McKinsey's or BCG's, which means each engineer I work with has 2-3x the impact. My individual contribution moves the needle more."
4. **Signing Bonus Bridge:** Push for a $25K-$35K signing bonus. Bain uses signing bonuses to compete with equity-offering tech companies.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the technology that supports Bain's PE advisory practice. I need $190K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $30K signing bonus. My tech offers include equity that Bain doesn't match." Bain will counter at $170K-$180K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $260K+.
