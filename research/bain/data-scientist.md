### Data Scientist | Bain Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (30-50%) | No Equity | PE Analytics Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boston | $170K-$240K | None | $51K-$120K (30-50%) | $221K-$360K |
| New York | $175K-$245K | None | $53K-$123K (30-50%) | $228K-$368K |
| London | £110K-£165K | None | £33K-£83K (30-50%) | £143K-£248K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Bain work within the firm's Advanced Analytics Group to build predictive models, statistical analyses, and AI-powered insights for PE due diligence, client consulting engagements, and internal analytics. Bain's PE focus gives its data scientists unique exposure to financial modeling and investment analysis that other consulting firms can't match. Data Scientists here routinely build models that directly influence whether a PE fund invests $1B+ in an acquisition. Bain does not offer equity; bonus trends toward 30-50%, with PE-supporting data scientists earning at the top of the range. The firm actively recruits PhDs in quantitative fields and pays a significant premium for this expertise. [Source: Bain Advanced Analytics Group 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Bain Data Scientist = Google L4-L5 Research Scientist = Two Sigma Quant Researcher = Bridgewater Research Associate

**Global Levers**

1. **Investment Decision Impact:** "My models directly inform whether PE funds invest billions in acquisitions. The financial impact of my analytics work exceeds what most tech company data scientists can claim."
2. **PhD/Quantitative Premium:** "My PhD in [quantitative field] represents years of specialized training that Bain benefits from immediately. The premium for this expertise should be 15-25% above standard engineering comp."
3. **PE Fund Alternative:** "Data scientists with PE analytics experience are aggressively recruited by hedge funds and PE funds at $350K-$600K TC with carry. Bain needs to offer competitive cash comp."
4. **Bain Capital Proximity:** "My work directly supports analysis for Bain Capital portfolio companies. This proximity to $170B+ AUM creates unique value that should be reflected in comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "My analytics directly inform billion-dollar investment decisions. I need $235K base with a 40% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $40K signing bonus. My PE fund and hedge fund alternatives are at $400K-$500K TC with carry." Bain will counter at $210K-$225K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $345K.
