### Advanced Analytics Engineer | Bain Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (25-50%) | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15-25% PE ANALYTICS PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boston | $185K-$245K | None | $56K-$123K (30-50%) | $241K-$368K |
| New York | $190K-$250K | None | $57K-$125K (30-50%) | $247K-$375K |
| London | £115K-£170K | None | £35K-£85K (30-50%) | £150K-£255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Bain's signature analytics technology role. Bain's Advanced Analytics Group (AAG) builds the quantitative models, data infrastructure, and AI tools that power the firm's world-leading private equity advisory practice. Bain is the dominant consulting firm in PE due diligence — the firm advises on more PE deals than McKinsey and BCG combined. Advanced Analytics Engineers build the commercial due diligence models, market sizing algorithms, and predictive analytics that PE firms use to decide on multi-billion dollar acquisitions. Bain does not offer equity to non-partner employees; comp is base + performance bonus (25-50%). The PE connection means Bain's analytics practice generates outsized revenue per engagement — and engineers supporting this work can leverage that in negotiations.

**Level Mapping:** Bain Senior Advanced Analytics Engineer = Google L4-L5 Data/ML Engineer = Palantir FDE = Two Sigma Quant Developer

**What Makes This Role Unique**

Bain's Advanced Analytics Engineer sits at the intersection of consulting, private equity, and technology:
- **PE Due Diligence Models:** Building the analytical models that inform $1B-$50B acquisition decisions
- **Commercial Analytics:** Market sizing, customer segmentation, and pricing optimization that directly drive deal outcomes
- **Cross-Fund Exposure:** Working with Bain Capital, KKR, Blackstone, and other PE titans
- **High-Stakes Delivery:** Your models directly influence investment decisions with billions at stake

**Global Levers**

1. **PE Revenue Premium:** "Bain's PE advisory practice generates $3B+ in annual revenue — the highest-margin practice at the firm. My analytics work directly supports the due diligence that wins and retains PE clients. My comp should reflect the revenue I enable."
2. **Investment Decision Impact:** "My analytical models inform acquisition decisions worth $1B-$50B. The accuracy and speed of my work directly impacts deal outcomes for PE funds. That level of financial impact warrants premium compensation."
3. **No-Equity Alternative Frame:** "Analytics engineers at PE funds (Two Sigma, Citadel, Bridgewater) earn $300K-$600K TC with carried interest. Bain needs to offer competitive cash comp to retain talent that PE funds actively recruit."
4. **Bain Capital Proximity:** "Bain Capital is one of the world's largest PE firms, and my work directly supports their investment thesis development. This proximity to $170B+ AUM creates unique leverage in comp discussions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the analytics that power Bain's dominant PE advisory practice. I need $240K base with a 35% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $40K signing bonus. My work informs billion-dollar investment decisions. PE fund alternatives offer $350K-$500K TC with carry." Bain will counter at $215K-$230K base. Push on the signing bonus. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $350K.
