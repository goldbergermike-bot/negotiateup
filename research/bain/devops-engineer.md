### DevOps Engineer | Bain Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (25-45%) | No Equity | Analytics Platform Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boston | $155K-$190K | None | $39K-$86K (25-45%) | $194K-$276K |
| New York | $160K-$195K | None | $40K-$88K (25-45%) | $200K-$283K |
| Bangalore | ₹24L-₹38L | None | ₹6L-₹17L (25-45%) | ₹30L-₹55L |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Bain manage the cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and platform reliability that support the firm's analytics platforms and internal technology. Bain's PE due diligence work requires high-availability data platforms that can process large datasets under tight deal timelines. DevOps engineers ensure these systems are reliable, scalable, and secure. Bain runs primarily on AWS with growing multi-cloud capabilities. Bain does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (25-45%). DevOps at Bain is a smaller team than at McKinsey or BCG, which means more individual ownership and direct impact.

**Level Mapping:** Bain DevOps Engineer = Google L3-L4 SRE = Amazon SDE II (Infra) = Datadog Senior DevOps

**Global Levers**

1. **Deal-Critical Infrastructure:** "Bain's PE due diligence platforms must have near-100% uptime during active deals. A platform outage during a $5B deal analysis costs the firm reputation and revenue."
2. **Small Team, Full Ownership:** "Bain's DevOps team is lean, which means I own more infrastructure end-to-end than I would at a larger consulting firm. More ownership should mean more comp."
3. **No-Equity Market Adjustment:** "DevOps engineers at tech companies earn $220K-$310K TC with equity. Bain's cash structure needs to be competitive."
4. **Analytics Platform Complexity:** "Supporting analytics and ML workloads requires specialized DevOps skills — GPU infrastructure, model serving, real-time data processing. This complexity commands a premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm maintaining the infrastructure that Bain's PE analytics practice depends on. I need $190K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $25K signing bonus. My tech alternatives offer $250K-$300K TC with equity." Bain will counter at $170K-$180K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $245K+.
