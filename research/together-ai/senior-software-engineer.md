**Negotiation DNA**

As a Senior Software Engineer at Together AI, you are a critical technical contributor to the Together Kernel inference optimization framework — the proprietary engine that emerged from FlashAttention, the most widely adopted algorithmic optimization in modern AI. Together AI's 400% YoY revenue growth is driven by engineers at your level who own major subsystems, mentor junior engineers, and ship production-quality kernel and infrastructure code. Your seniority means you directly influence the performance and efficiency of inference workloads that power AI deployments across the industry.

**Together Kernel — The FlashAttention Premium**

Together AI created FlashAttention — the single most impactful algorithmic optimization in modern AI, used by every major AI lab. Together Kernel is the proprietary inference optimization framework that delivers state-of-the-art speed and efficiency across GPU architectures. With 400% YoY revenue growth and a $3.3B valuation, the company's trajectory is defined by kernel-level breakthroughs. As a Senior Software Engineer, you build the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment. This warrants a 20–30% Kernel Innovation premium. At the senior level, you own key components of this stack — your architectural decisions compound across every customer deployment. Frame this as: "I'm not just writing code at one company; I'm building the inference layer that the entire AI industry runs on."

**Global Levers**

1. **Kernel Ownership:** "At senior level, I own subsystems within Together Kernel — my architectural choices directly impact inference latency and cost for every customer, which drives the 400% revenue growth."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Acceleration:** "Given the $3.3B valuation and growth trajectory, I want to discuss accelerated vesting or a refresher mechanism that rewards me for staying through the next valuation inflection."
3. **FlashAttention Pedigree:** "Together AI is the birthplace of FlashAttention — working here means I'm at the epicenter of inference optimization. That pedigree commands a premium over generic senior SWE roles."
4. **Market Scarcity:** "Senior engineers with kernel-level inference optimization experience are among the hardest-to-hire profiles in AI — I've seen competing offers 15–25% above standard senior bands for this skillset."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply aligned with Together AI's mission to democratize AI inference through kernel-level innovation. My current competing offer is $295K TC from [FAANG/AI lab]. I'm targeting a base of $240K, equity valued at $80K/year at the current 409A valuation, and a 15% bonus target — bringing my total comp to approximately $310K. My accept-at floor is $275K TC. Below that threshold, the pre-IPO risk isn't justified against my liquid FAANG alternative. I'd also like to negotiate a $30K sign-on bonus to bridge my unvested RSUs and a one-year cliff instead of the standard schedule."
