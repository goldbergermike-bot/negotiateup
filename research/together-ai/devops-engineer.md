**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Together AI build and maintain the infrastructure that deploys Together Kernel — the proprietary inference optimization framework born from FlashAttention — at massive scale across GPU clusters worldwide. Together AI's 400% YoY revenue growth means infrastructure demands are doubling every few months, and you are the engineer who ensures the kernel optimization stack runs reliably, scales seamlessly, and deploys continuously. Your CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, and monitoring systems are the scaffolding on which Together AI's $3.3B valuation rests.

**Together Kernel — The FlashAttention Premium**

Together AI created FlashAttention — the single most impactful algorithmic optimization in modern AI, used by every major AI lab. Together Kernel is the proprietary inference optimization framework that delivers state-of-the-art speed and efficiency. With 400% YoY revenue growth and a $3.3B valuation, Together AI needs DevOps engineers who can deploy kernel-optimized inference workloads across heterogeneous GPU environments with zero-downtime reliability. As a DevOps Engineer, you deploy and operationalize the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment. This justifies a 20–25% Kernel Innovation premium. Your negotiation leverage: "I build the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — and I'm the one who makes sure it actually runs in production at scale across thousands of GPUs."

**Global Levers**

1. **GPU Infrastructure Expertise:** "DevOps for GPU-native inference infrastructure is fundamentally different from cloud-app DevOps. I manage multi-cluster GPU deployments, kernel-level monitoring, and inference-specific CI/CD — this commands a premium."
2. **Pre-IPO Reliability Equity:** "Infrastructure reliability directly impacts customer trust and revenue. At 400% growth, every minute of downtime costs exponentially more. My equity should reflect that I'm the uptime guarantee."
3. **Scaling Urgency:** "Together AI's infrastructure needs are growing faster than its team. I'll be operating at a scope that would typically require a team of 3–5 at a larger company."
4. **Operational Criticality:** "If Together Kernel doesn't deploy reliably, the product doesn't exist. I'm not support infrastructure — I'm the deployment engine for the core product."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the deployment infrastructure for Together Kernel at a critical scaling moment. My competing offer is $235K TC from [AWS/Google Cloud/Datadog]. I'm targeting a base of $190K, equity valued at $58K/year at current 409A, and a 15% bonus target — approximately $242K TC. My accept-at floor is $220K TC. Below that threshold, the pre-IPO risk premium doesn't justify leaving a liquid compensation package. I also want a $20K sign-on bonus and on-call compensation or additional equity for infrastructure pager responsibilities."
