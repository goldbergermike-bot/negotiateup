### Security Engineer | Together AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | AI Inference & Optimization | 400% YoY Growth | $3.3B Valuation | +20% Kernel Innovation Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$218K | $42K–$72K | 10–15% | $198K–$278K |
| Seattle | $157K–$207K | $40K–$68K | 10–15% | $188K–$264K |
| Remote US | $148K–$196K | $37K–$65K | 10–15% | $178K–$250K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Together AI protect the Together Kernel inference platform and the broader Together AI cloud — securing the infrastructure that handles sensitive customer model data, inference workloads, and API traffic for enterprises worldwide. With Together AI's 400% YoY revenue growth driving rapid enterprise adoption, security is not optional — it's a prerequisite for every major contract. You secure the FlashAttention-powered inference stack that the industry depends on, and your work directly enables Together AI to close enterprise deals that require SOC 2, ISO 27001, and HIPAA compliance.

**Together Kernel — The FlashAttention Premium**

Together AI created FlashAttention — the single most impactful algorithmic optimization in modern AI, used by every major AI lab. Together Kernel is the proprietary inference optimization framework that delivers state-of-the-art speed and efficiency. With 400% YoY revenue growth and a $3.3B valuation, Together AI needs security engineers who understand kernel-level attack surfaces — side-channel attacks on GPU memory, inference data exfiltration, and model theft vectors unique to AI infrastructure. As a Security Engineer, you secure the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment. This justifies a 20–30% Kernel Innovation premium. Frame it as: "I build the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — and I'm the one who ensures it's secure enough for every enterprise and government customer."

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Deal Enablement:** "Every enterprise contract requires security sign-off. I directly enable revenue by ensuring Together AI meets SOC 2, ISO 27001, and HIPAA requirements — my work unblocks deals."
2. **Pre-IPO Security Equity:** "Security incidents at pre-IPO companies are valuation-destroying events. I'm protecting a $3.3B valuation — my equity should reflect that existential responsibility."
3. **AI Security Scarcity:** "Security engineers who understand GPU-level attack surfaces, inference data flows, and kernel-level vulnerabilities are a vanishingly small talent pool. This isn't web app security."
4. **Compliance Acceleration:** "At 400% growth, Together AI is onboarding enterprise customers faster than most companies build compliance programs. I'll be building the security foundation that scales with hypergrowth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited to build Together AI's security program during this critical enterprise growth phase. My competing offer is $265K TC from [Google/Palo Alto Networks/CrowdStrike]. I'm asking for a base of $215K, equity valued at $70K/year at current 409A, and a 15% bonus target — approximately $275K TC. My accept-at floor is $248K TC. Below that, the risk-to-comp ratio doesn't favor a pre-IPO company over my liquid alternative. I'd also want a $25K sign-on bonus, a security budget commitment, and a title of Senior Security Engineer given the scope of building security programs from the ground up."
