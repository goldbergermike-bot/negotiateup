**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Together AI are the technical bridge between the Together Kernel inference platform and enterprise customers — designing deployment architectures, optimizing inference workloads, and proving the performance advantages of FlashAttention-powered infrastructure in real customer environments. You are a direct revenue driver: your technical expertise converts evaluations into contracts and POCs into production deployments. Together AI's 400% YoY revenue growth depends on solutions architects who can articulate and demonstrate kernel-level performance advantages to technical decision-makers at Fortune 500 companies.

**Together Kernel — The FlashAttention Premium**

Together AI created FlashAttention — the single most impactful algorithmic optimization in modern AI, used by every major AI lab. Together Kernel is the proprietary inference optimization framework that delivers state-of-the-art speed and efficiency. With 400% YoY revenue growth and a $3.3B valuation, Together AI needs solutions architects who can translate kernel-level innovation into customer wins. As a Solutions Architect, you bring the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment — directly to enterprise customers and prove its value. This justifies a 20–25% Kernel Innovation premium. Your negotiation leverage: "I'm the person who turns Together Kernel's technical advantages into revenue — every enterprise deal I architect is a direct contribution to the 400% growth rate."

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue Attribution:** "I directly influence deal size and close rate by designing optimal inference architectures for enterprise customers. My technical credibility is a revenue engine — comp should reflect that."
2. **Pre-IPO Customer Equity:** "Solutions architects at growth-stage companies build the customer relationships that underpin valuation. I want equity that reflects my role in landing and expanding enterprise accounts."
3. **Technical Depth Premium:** "I need to understand FlashAttention, kernel optimization, GPU memory hierarchies, and quantization — then explain them to CTOs. This combination of depth and communication commands a premium."
4. **Competitive Poaching Risk:** "Every cloud provider and AI startup is hiring solutions architects with inference optimization expertise. My market value is set by AWS, Google Cloud, and Anthropic — Together AI needs to compete."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited to help Together AI's enterprise customers get maximum value from Together Kernel. My competing offer is $250K TC from [AWS/Databricks/Snowflake]. I'm asking for a base of $200K, equity valued at $68K/year at current 409A, and a 15% bonus target — approximately $258K TC. My accept-at floor is $235K TC. I'd also like a variable compensation component tied to customer deployment milestones, a $20K sign-on bonus, and travel stipend given the customer-facing nature of the role. Below my floor, the risk-adjusted math favors my established-company offer."
