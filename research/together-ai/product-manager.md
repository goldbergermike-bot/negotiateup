### Product Manager | Together AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Together AI define the product strategy for the Together Kernel inference platform and the broader Together AI cloud — translating kernel-level technical breakthroughs like FlashAttention into products that customers adopt and pay for. You sit at the intersection of Together AI's 400% YoY revenue growth and its technical moat, making product decisions that determine how the world's most efficient inference infrastructure reaches the market. Your role is uniquely high-leverage because Together AI's products are deeply technical — you need to understand kernel optimization to make the right product bets.

**Together Kernel — The FlashAttention Premium**

Together AI created FlashAttention — the single most impactful algorithmic optimization in modern AI, used by every major AI lab. Together Kernel is the proprietary inference optimization framework that delivers state-of-the-art speed and efficiency. With 400% YoY revenue growth and a $3.3B valuation, Together AI needs PMs who can productize kernel-level innovation into revenue. As a Product Manager, you translate the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment — into a product experience customers pay premium prices for. This justifies a 20–25% Kernel Innovation premium over generic PM roles. Your negotiation leverage: "I turn the most important inference optimization in AI into a product that drives 400% revenue growth — that's not standard PM work."

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue Translation:** "I translate Together Kernel's technical advantages into product-market fit and revenue. Together AI's 400% growth requires PMs who can ship deeply technical products — that's a rare skill."
2. **Pre-IPO Product Equity:** "As the PM shaping how Together Kernel reaches customers, my product decisions directly impact valuation. I want equity that reflects my influence on the revenue trajectory."
3. **Technical PM Scarcity:** "PMs who understand kernel-level inference optimization AND can drive product strategy are exceptionally rare. I'm not competing against generic PMs — I'm in a market of dozens."
4. **Growth-Stage Leverage:** "At 400% YoY growth, every quarter of product velocity matters. A strong PM accelerates time-to-revenue — I want a comp package that reflects that urgency."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited to shape Together AI's product strategy during this incredible growth phase. I have a competing offer of $275K TC from [Google/Anthropic] for a similar PM role. I'm asking for a base of $220K, equity valued at $72K/year at current 409A, and a 15% bonus target — bringing total comp to approximately $285K. My accept-at floor is $260K TC. Below that, the risk premium for a pre-IPO role doesn't pencil out against my liquid offer. I'd also like a $20K sign-on bonus and a 6-month equity refresh review tied to product milestones."
