**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Together AI sit at the heart of the company's mission: building, optimizing, and deploying the AI models and inference systems that run on Together Kernel — the proprietary optimization framework that emerged from FlashAttention. You work at the intersection of model architecture, inference optimization, and production ML systems, directly contributing to Together AI's 400% YoY revenue growth by making models run faster, cheaper, and at higher quality. Your role commands a 15–25% AI Premium because you combine ML expertise with systems-level optimization in a way that few engineers in the industry can.

**Together Kernel — The FlashAttention Premium**

Together AI created FlashAttention — the single most impactful algorithmic optimization in modern AI, used by every major AI lab. Together Kernel is the proprietary inference optimization framework that delivers state-of-the-art speed and efficiency. With 400% YoY revenue growth and a $3.3B valuation, Together AI needs ML/AI engineers who can push the frontier of model optimization, quantization, and efficient inference — building on the FlashAttention foundation. As an ML/AI Engineer, you directly build the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment. This justifies a 20–30% Kernel Innovation premium on top of the 15–25% AI Premium inherent to the role. Your dual premium negotiation: "I build the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment — and I do it with deep ML expertise that bridges research and production. That's a double premium: AI talent scarcity plus kernel innovation impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual Premium Positioning:** "I command both an AI talent premium (15–25%) and a Kernel Innovation premium (20–30%). ML engineers who can optimize at the kernel level are the most sought-after profile in AI — my comp should reflect both premiums."
2. **Pre-IPO Research Equity:** "My research contributions to model optimization and inference efficiency directly increase Together AI's technical moat and valuation. I want equity that values my intellectual contributions."
3. **FlashAttention Lineage:** "I'd be joining the team that created FlashAttention and working on Together Kernel — the next generation of inference optimization. This is the most impactful ML engineering role in the industry."
4. **Competing Offer Intensity:** "The market for ML/AI engineers with inference optimization expertise is the most competitive in tech. I have offers from [OpenAI/Anthropic/Google DeepMind] — Together AI needs to match the intensity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Together AI is where I want to be — the combination of FlashAttention's legacy and Together Kernel's future is unmatched. My competing offer is $310K TC from [OpenAI/Anthropic/Google DeepMind]. I'm asking for a base of $245K, equity valued at $88K/year at current 409A, and a 20% bonus target — approximately $320K TC. My accept-at floor is $290K TC, which reflects both my AI Premium and the Kernel Innovation premium this role commands. Below that, the risk-adjusted math doesn't work. I also want a $35K sign-on bonus, publication rights for non-proprietary research, and a commitment to GPU compute budget for personal research projects."
