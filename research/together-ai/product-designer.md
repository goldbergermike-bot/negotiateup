### Product Designer | Together AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | AI Inference & Optimization | 400% YoY Growth | $3.3B Valuation | +15% Kernel Innovation Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $130K–$170K | $30K–$52K | 8–12% | $155K–$215K |
| Seattle | $124K–$162K | $28K–$49K | 8–12% | $147K–$204K |
| Remote US | $117K–$153K | $27K–$46K | 8–12% | $140K–$193K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Together AI create the interfaces and experiences through which developers and enterprises interact with the Together Kernel inference platform — the most technically advanced AI inference stack in the industry. Together AI's 400% YoY revenue growth depends on developer adoption, and developer adoption depends on design quality. You translate kernel-level performance metrics into intuitive dashboards, API playgrounds, and deployment workflows that make FlashAttention-powered inference accessible to every developer.

**Together Kernel — The FlashAttention Premium**

Together AI created FlashAttention — the single most impactful algorithmic optimization in modern AI, used by every major AI lab. Together Kernel is the proprietary inference optimization framework that delivers state-of-the-art speed and efficiency. With 400% YoY revenue growth and a $3.3B valuation, Together AI needs designers who can make complex kernel-level infrastructure feel simple. As a Product Designer, you make the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment — usable and delightful for developers. This justifies a 20–25% Kernel Innovation premium over standard design roles. Your negotiation frame: "I design the interface to the most important inference optimization in AI. If developers can't use Together Kernel easily, the technical moat doesn't translate to revenue."

**Global Levers**

1. **Developer Experience Leverage:** "Developer adoption drives Together AI's revenue. My design work directly impacts conversion, retention, and expansion — I'm a revenue driver, not a cost center."
2. **Pre-IPO Design Equity:** "Joining a $3.3B pre-IPO company as a designer means I'm taking significant risk. I want equity that reflects both the risk and the outsized impact design has on developer adoption."
3. **AI Infrastructure Design Scarcity:** "Designers who can create experiences for kernel-level AI infrastructure are rare — this isn't consumer UI. I need to deeply understand inference, GPU utilization, and developer workflows."
4. **Growth-Stage Impact:** "At 400% YoY growth, every design improvement to the Together platform compounds across a rapidly expanding customer base. My work has increasing returns to scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited to design the developer experience for Together Kernel and the broader Together AI platform. My competing offer is $205K TC from [Figma/Vercel/similar]. I'm asking for a base of $165K, equity valued at $50K/year at current 409A, and a 12% bonus target — totaling approximately $210K TC. My accept-at floor is $190K TC. Below that, the compensation gap with established companies doesn't justify the pre-IPO risk. I'd also appreciate a $15K sign-on bonus and a commitment to a design system ownership scope."
