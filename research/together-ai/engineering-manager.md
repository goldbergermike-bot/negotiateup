### Engineering Manager | Together AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | AI Inference & Optimization | 400% YoY Growth | $3.3B Valuation | +20% Kernel Innovation Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $210K–$275K | $65K–$110K | 15–20% | $262K–$368K |
| Seattle | $200K–$261K | $62K–$105K | 15–20% | $249K–$350K |
| Remote US | $189K–$247K | $58K–$98K | 15–20% | $236K–$331K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Together AI lead the teams that build and ship Together Kernel — the proprietary inference optimization framework born from FlashAttention that powers the company's 400% YoY revenue growth. You are responsible for hiring, retaining, and multiplying the output of some of the most sought-after systems and kernel engineers in the world. Your leadership directly translates into Together AI's ability to execute on its $3.3B valuation trajectory, making you a force multiplier on the company's most critical asset: its engineering talent.

**Together Kernel — The FlashAttention Premium**

Together AI created FlashAttention — the single most impactful algorithmic optimization in modern AI, used by every major AI lab. Together Kernel is the proprietary inference optimization framework that delivers state-of-the-art speed and efficiency. With 400% YoY revenue growth and a $3.3B valuation, Together AI needs engineering managers who can scale teams building kernel-level infrastructure without sacrificing technical excellence. As an Engineering Manager, you build the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment — by building and leading the teams that make it happen. This justifies a 20–30% Kernel Innovation premium. Your negotiation leverage is unique: you're not just managing engineers, you're scaling the team behind the most consequential inference optimization in AI history. Frame it as: "I scale the team that builds the foundational infrastructure every AI lab depends on."

**Global Levers**

1. **Talent Multiplier:** "I lead the team building Together Kernel — the inference stack every AI lab relies on. My ability to recruit and retain kernel engineers directly drives your 400% revenue growth."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Weighting:** "Engineering leadership at a $3.3B pre-IPO company with this growth rate needs equity-heavy comp. I'm targeting $100K–$110K in annual equity value at current 409A."
3. **Hiring Difficulty Premium:** "Kernel and inference engineers are the hardest profile to hire in AI. An EM who can attract and retain them is worth a significant premium — I've built teams of this caliber before."
4. **Scope Expansion:** "At Together AI's growth rate, my team will likely double within 12 months. I want to lock in a refresher mechanism tied to team growth and delivery milestones."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm thrilled about the opportunity to lead a Together Kernel team. My competing offer is $350K TC from [Google/Meta] for a similar EM scope. To accept Together AI, I need a base of $265K, equity valued at $105K/year at current 409A, and a 20% bonus target — bringing my TC to approximately $360K. My accept-at floor is $330K TC. I also want double-trigger acceleration, a written scope commitment for my team size, and a $35K sign-on bonus to offset my unvested RSUs. Below my floor, the liquid-to-illiquid trade doesn't make financial sense."
