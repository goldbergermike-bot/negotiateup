### Data Scientist | Together AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | AI Inference & Optimization | 400% YoY Growth | $3.3B Valuation | +20% Kernel Innovation Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $155K–$205K | $42K–$70K | 10–15% | $188K–$262K |
| Seattle | $147K–$195K | $40K–$67K | 10–15% | $179K–$249K |
| Remote US | $140K–$184K | $37K–$62K | 10–15% | $169K–$236K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Together AI analyze inference performance, model quality, pricing optimization, and customer behavior to drive the data-informed decisions behind Together AI's 400% YoY revenue growth. You work with data generated by the Together Kernel inference platform — the productized evolution of FlashAttention — to identify optimization opportunities, validate kernel performance improvements, and inform product and go-to-market strategy. Your analyses directly shape how Together AI prices, positions, and improves the most consequential inference infrastructure in the industry.

**Together Kernel — The FlashAttention Premium**

Together AI created FlashAttention — the single most impactful algorithmic optimization in modern AI, used by every major AI lab. Together Kernel is the proprietary inference optimization framework that delivers state-of-the-art speed and efficiency. With 400% YoY revenue growth and a $3.3B valuation, Together AI needs data scientists who can quantify kernel performance advantages and translate them into business intelligence. As a Data Scientist, you measure and optimize the layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment. This justifies a 20–25% Kernel Innovation premium. Your analyses determine how Together Kernel's performance advantages translate into pricing power, customer retention, and revenue growth. Frame it as: "I build the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — and I prove it with data that drives pricing and growth strategy."

**Global Levers**

1. **Performance Quantification:** "I translate kernel-level performance gains into business metrics that drive pricing and revenue strategy. My analyses justify Together AI's premium positioning in the market."
2. **Pre-IPO Data Equity:** "Data scientists at growth-stage companies directly influence valuation through pricing optimization and growth analytics. My equity should reflect that I'm shaping the revenue model."
3. **AI Infrastructure Data Expertise:** "Data science at an inference platform company requires deep understanding of GPU utilization, latency distributions, and kernel performance — this is not generic product analytics."
4. **Growth-Stage Urgency:** "At 400% YoY growth, data-driven decisions compound faster. Every pricing optimization or churn analysis I deliver has outsized impact during this growth phase."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm drawn to Together AI because of the unique data challenges at the intersection of kernel performance and business strategy. My competing offer is $250K TC from [Google/Meta/Databricks]. I'm targeting a base of $200K, equity valued at $68K/year at current 409A, and a 15% bonus target — approximately $260K TC. My accept-at floor is $235K TC. Below that, the risk-adjusted comp doesn't compete with my liquid offer. I'd also like a $20K sign-on bonus and quarterly equity refresh discussions tied to business impact metrics."
