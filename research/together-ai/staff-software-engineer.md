**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Together AI define the technical direction of the Together Kernel inference optimization platform — the productized evolution of FlashAttention that has become the industry standard for high-performance AI inference. At the staff level, you set architectural standards, drive cross-team technical strategy, and make decisions that directly affect Together AI's ability to sustain its 400% YoY revenue growth. You are the technical multiplier: your design choices propagate across the entire inference stack and into every customer deployment.

**Together Kernel — The FlashAttention Premium**

Together AI created FlashAttention — the single most impactful algorithmic optimization in modern AI, used by every major AI lab. Together Kernel is the proprietary inference optimization framework that delivers state-of-the-art speed and efficiency. With 400% YoY revenue growth and a $3.3B valuation, Together AI is in hypergrowth fueled by kernel-level innovation. As a Staff Software Engineer, you don't just build the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — you architect it. You are the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment, personified. This justifies a 25–30% Kernel Innovation premium over comparable staff-level roles. At this level, your technical leadership defines what Together Kernel becomes next — frame your negotiation as: "I build the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment. My architectural decisions become the industry's performance ceiling."

**Global Levers**

1. **Architectural Authority:** "As a Staff engineer, my design decisions on Together Kernel define the inference performance ceiling for the entire AI industry — that level of influence justifies staff-plus compensation."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Weight:** "At $3.3B valuation with 400% growth, I want equity to be the largest component of my comp. I'm proposing a grant of $130K–$140K annually at current 409A, with double-trigger acceleration."
3. **FlashAttention Legacy:** "I'd be joining the team that created FlashAttention. The technical bar here is unmatched — and so should be the compensation. I expect a 25% premium over standard staff offers."
4. **Retention Economics:** "Replacing a staff engineer at this stage costs 6–12 months of velocity. A competitive initial package is cheaper than a re-hire — let's get the offer right the first time."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Together AI is my top choice because of the technical depth of Together Kernel and the FlashAttention legacy. I'm holding a competing offer of $410K TC from [Google/Meta/OpenAI]. To accept Together AI, I need a base of $300K, equity valued at $135K/year at current 409A, a 20% bonus target, and double-trigger acceleration on my equity. That brings my target TC to $420K. My accept-at floor is $380K TC — below that, the pre-IPO risk delta against my liquid FAANG offer is too steep. I'd also like a $50K sign-on to bridge year-one equity vesting and written confirmation of my scope as a technical lead on a core Kernel subsystem."
