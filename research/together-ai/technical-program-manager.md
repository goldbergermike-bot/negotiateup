### Technical Program Manager | Together AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Bonus | AI Inference & Optimization | 400% YoY Growth | $3.3B Valuation | +15% Kernel Innovation Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $148K–$195K | $38K–$60K | 10–15% | $178K–$245K |
| Seattle | $141K–$185K | $36K–$57K | 10–15% | $169K–$233K |
| Remote US | $133K–$175K | $34K–$54K | 10–15% | $160K–$220K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Together AI coordinate the cross-functional execution of Together Kernel development, GPU infrastructure scaling, and platform releases — ensuring that the company's 400% YoY revenue growth is supported by disciplined program delivery. You are the operational backbone that keeps kernel engineers, ML researchers, product teams, and infrastructure teams aligned and shipping. At a company built on FlashAttention's legacy, the TPM role is critical: you manage the complexity of shipping kernel-level optimizations across multiple GPU architectures, customer deployment environments, and competitive timelines.

**Together Kernel — The FlashAttention Premium**

Together AI created FlashAttention — the single most impactful algorithmic optimization in modern AI, used by every major AI lab. Together Kernel is the proprietary inference optimization framework that delivers state-of-the-art speed and efficiency. With 400% YoY revenue growth and a $3.3B valuation, Together AI needs TPMs who can orchestrate the delivery of kernel-level innovations across engineering, product, and go-to-market teams simultaneously. As a Technical Program Manager, you coordinate the teams building the optimization layer that makes AI inference fast and cheap everywhere — the foundational infrastructure of AI deployment. This justifies a 20–25% Kernel Innovation premium. Frame your negotiation as: "I ensure that FlashAttention-derived innovations ship on time, at quality, across every GPU architecture — I'm the execution engine behind the kernel premium."

**Global Levers**

1. **Execution Multiplier:** "I accelerate Together Kernel delivery velocity across multiple teams. At 400% growth, every week of faster shipping compounds into revenue — my coordination directly drives the growth rate."
2. **Pre-IPO Complexity Equity:** "Managing programs at a pre-IPO company with this growth rate is exponentially harder than at an established company. I'm doing the job of 2–3 TPMs at a FAANG — equity should reflect that."
3. **Cross-Functional Scarcity:** "TPMs who understand kernel optimization, GPU infrastructure, and ML model deployment are extremely rare. I bridge technical depth with program management — that intersection commands premium comp."
4. **Growth-Stage Scope:** "My program scope at Together AI will encompass kernel development, cloud platform releases, enterprise deployments, and GPU procurement — that's a director-level scope at a larger company."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm eager to drive Together Kernel program execution during this hypergrowth phase. My competing offer is $235K TC from [Google/Amazon/Meta]. I'm asking for a base of $190K, equity valued at $58K/year at current 409A, and a 15% bonus target — approximately $240K TC. My accept-at floor is $218K TC. Below that, the scope-to-comp ratio doesn't justify the pre-IPO risk. I'd also like a $15K sign-on bonus, and I want to discuss a title upgrade to Senior TPM given the breadth of programs I'd be managing."
