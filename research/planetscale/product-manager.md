### Product Manager | PlanetScale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($1.2B Valuation) | Serverless MySQL Platform (Vitess-based) | Open-Source Foundation | Higher Risk/Reward

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $170K–$230K | $85K–$235K | — | $225K–$355K |
| Remote US | $155K–$215K | $75K–$215K | — | $205K–$330K |

**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at PlanetScale own the product roadmap for a serverless MySQL platform built on Vitess. PM scope includes the database branching experience, serverless pricing and scaling model, schema change workflows, developer experience, and enterprise features. The PM role requires deep technical understanding of database internals — you must understand sharding, replication, and query routing to make effective product decisions. PlanetScale's dual open-source/commercial model adds product strategy complexity. [Source: PlanetScale PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** PlanetScale PM = CockroachDB PM = MongoDB PM = Google PM (Cloud SQL)

**Global Levers**

1. **Serverless Pricing Strategy:** "Serverless database pricing is a complex product challenge that directly impacts revenue and customer adoption. My pricing decisions determine PlanetScale's business model."
2. **Database Branching Innovation:** "I'm defining the product experience for database branching — a feature unique to PlanetScale that redefines how developers manage schema changes."
3. **Open-Source + Commercial Strategy:** "Balancing Vitess open-source community needs with PlanetScale commercial priorities requires nuanced product strategy."
4. **CockroachDB/MongoDB PM Counter:** Both offer competitive PM comp.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $225K over 4 years. My pricing and product decisions directly determine PlanetScale's business model and competitive position." Counter at $190K-$215K equity is competitive.
