**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at PlanetScale own the product roadmap for a serverless MySQL platform built on Vitess. PM scope includes the database branching experience, serverless pricing and scaling model, schema change workflows, developer experience, and enterprise features. The PM role requires deep technical understanding of database internals — you must understand sharding, replication, and query routing to make effective product decisions. PlanetScale's dual open-source/commercial model adds product strategy complexity. [Source: PlanetScale PM Comp 2025-2026]
