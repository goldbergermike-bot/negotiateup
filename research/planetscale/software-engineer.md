### Software Engineer | PlanetScale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($1.2B Valuation) | Serverless MySQL Platform (Vitess-based) | Open-Source Foundation | Higher Risk/Reward

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $155K–$215K | $70K–$220K | — | $195K–$330K |
| Remote US | $145K–$205K | $65K–$200K | — | $185K–$310K |

**Negotiation DNA**

PlanetScale is a private serverless MySQL platform ($1.2B valuation) headquartered in San Francisco, built on Vitess (the open-source database clustering system created at YouTube). SWEs build the PlanetScale platform — database branching, non-blocking schema changes, serverless scaling, and the Vitess core. At $1.2B, PlanetScale is earlier-stage than competitors like CockroachDB ($5B) and MongoDB (public), meaning higher risk but potentially higher equity upside. Compensation is base + equity (no standard bonus). [Source: PlanetScale SWE Comp Data 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** PlanetScale SWE = CockroachDB SWE = MongoDB SWE = Google L3

**Global Levers**

1. **Vitess Open-Source Heritage:** "PlanetScale is built on Vitess — proven at YouTube/Google scale. I'm working on a technology with battle-tested foundations."
2. **Higher Risk/Reward Equity:** "PlanetScale at $1.2B has more room for valuation growth than competitors at $5B+. I need a larger equity grant to reflect both the risk and the upside potential."
3. **Database Branching Innovation:** "Database branching is PlanetScale's unique innovation. My work on this feature set has no equivalent at any other database company."
4. **Cockroach Labs/MongoDB Counter:** Both offer equity at higher valuations or with liquidity. Push PlanetScale for a larger grant.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $210K over 4 years with double-trigger acceleration. PlanetScale's $1.2B valuation means both higher risk and higher upside — the grant should reflect this." Counter at $175K-$200K equity with acceleration is competitive.
