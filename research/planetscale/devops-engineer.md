### DevOps Engineer | PlanetScale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($1.2B Valuation) | Serverless MySQL Platform (Vitess-based) | Open-Source Foundation | Higher Risk/Reward

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $160K–$225K | $80K–$225K | — | $210K–$340K |
| Remote US | $150K–$210K | $70K–$205K | — | $195K–$315K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at PlanetScale manage the infrastructure that runs a serverless MySQL database platform. This is among the most complex infrastructure challenges in tech: running thousands of Vitess clusters with automatic scaling, zero-downtime operations, and multi-region data replication. The serverless model adds unique infrastructure challenges — auto-scaling compute and storage in response to workload changes while maintaining database consistency. Infrastructure reliability is existentially important — database downtime means customer data inaccessibility. [Source: PlanetScale DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** PlanetScale Senior DevOps = CockroachDB DevOps = MongoDB Cloud SRE = Google L4 SRE

**Global Levers**

1. **Serverless Database Infrastructure:** "Running serverless MySQL at scale requires auto-scaling infrastructure that maintains database consistency during scaling events. This is harder than standard serverless infrastructure."
2. **Vitess Cluster Management:** "Managing thousands of Vitess clusters with zero-downtime operations is among the most complex infrastructure challenges."
3. **Zero Data Loss Mandate:** "Database infrastructure has a zero data loss mandate. The reliability standard is absolute."
4. **Datadog/MongoDB Counter:** Both offer competitive infrastructure comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $215K over 4 years with acceleration. Serverless database infrastructure with zero data loss is the highest-bar infrastructure work." Counter at $180K-$205K equity is competitive.
