**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($1.2B Valuation) | Serverless MySQL Platform (Vitess-based) | Open-Source Foundation | Higher Risk/Reward

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $160K–$225K | $75K–$215K | — | $205K–$335K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at PlanetScale help enterprise customers migrate from legacy MySQL deployments to PlanetScale's serverless platform. SAs architect database branching workflows, configure sharding strategies, plan schema migration paths, and optimize query performance on Vitess. The SA role requires deep MySQL expertise combined with understanding of Vitess sharding, PlanetScale's serverless model, and database branching workflows. [Source: PlanetScale SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** PlanetScale Senior SA = CockroachDB SA = MongoDB SA = AWS Aurora SA

**Global Levers**

1. **MySQL Migration Expertise:** "I plan and execute migrations from legacy MySQL to PlanetScale. Each successful migration is a multi-year ARR commitment."
2. **Vitess Sharding Architecture:** "I architect Vitess sharding strategies for enterprise workloads. Sharding architecture decisions are irreversible and must be correct."
3. **Database Branching Workflows:** "I help enterprises adopt database branching — a workflow paradigm that's unique to PlanetScale."
4. **CockroachDB/MongoDB SA Counter:** Both pay SAs competitively.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $205K over 4 years. My MySQL migration expertise and Vitess sharding architecture directly drive enterprise ARR." Counter at $175K-$195K equity is competitive.
