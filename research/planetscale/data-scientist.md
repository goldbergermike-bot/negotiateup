### Data Scientist | PlanetScale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($1.2B Valuation) | Serverless MySQL Platform (Vitess-based) | Open-Source Foundation | Higher Risk/Reward

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $165K–$230K | $85K–$235K | — | $220K–$350K |
| Remote US | $150K–$215K | $75K–$215K | — | $200K–$325K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at PlanetScale work on product analytics, serverless pricing optimization, and ML features for the MySQL platform. The serverless model generates rich data about database usage patterns — query workload characteristics, scaling behavior, branching activity, and schema change patterns. DS roles include building predictive models for serverless autoscaling, pricing optimization, and query performance prediction. [Source: PlanetScale DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** PlanetScale Senior DS = CockroachDB DS = MongoDB DS = Google L4 DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Serverless Pricing Optimization:** "My pricing models directly impact PlanetScale's revenue and customer satisfaction. Serverless pricing optimization is a high-impact DS challenge."
2. **Autoscaling ML Models:** "My ML models power serverless autoscaling — predicting workload patterns and scaling resources proactively."
3. **Database Performance Prediction:** "Predicting query performance across a distributed MySQL platform is a unique and technically deep DS domain."
4. **Google/Meta DS Counter:** Both offer higher DS comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $225K over 4 years. My pricing and autoscaling models directly drive PlanetScale's revenue and product quality." Counter at $190K-$215K equity is competitive.
