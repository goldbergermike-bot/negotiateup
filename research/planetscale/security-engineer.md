**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at PlanetScale protect a managed MySQL database platform that stores customer production data. Database security is the most critical layer of the software stack — a breach doesn't just expose data, it can compromise data integrity across every application using PlanetScale. The serverless model adds security complexity: multi-tenant isolation, ephemeral compute security, and access control across database branches. Enterprise customers require SOC2 and HIPAA compliance.
