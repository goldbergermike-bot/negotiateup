### Security Engineer | PlanetScale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($1.2B Valuation) | Serverless MySQL Platform (Vitess-based) | Open-Source Foundation | Higher Risk/Reward

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $170K–$230K | $85K–$235K | — | $225K–$355K |
| Remote US | $155K–$215K | $75K–$215K | — | $205K–$330K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at PlanetScale protect a managed MySQL database platform that stores customer production data. Database security is the most critical layer of the software stack — a breach doesn't just expose data, it can compromise data integrity across every application using PlanetScale. The serverless model adds security complexity: multi-tenant isolation, ephemeral compute security, and access control across database branches. Enterprise customers require SOC2 and HIPAA compliance.

**Level Mapping:** PlanetScale Senior Security Eng = CockroachDB Security Eng = MongoDB Security Eng = Google L4 Security

**Global Levers**

1. **Database Security = Foundation of Trust:** "Database security is the foundation of customer trust. A PlanetScale security breach would compromise production data for every customer."
2. **Serverless Multi-Tenant Isolation:** "Securing multi-tenant serverless database infrastructure requires strict compute and data isolation between customers."
3. **Database Branching Security:** "Database branching introduces unique security challenges — access control across branches, data isolation, and branch permission models."
4. **CrowdStrike/Snyk Counter:** Security companies offer premium comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $225K over 4 years. Database security is the foundation of customer trust, and I have offers from security companies with liquid equity." Counter at $190K-$215K equity is competitive.
