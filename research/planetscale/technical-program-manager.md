Key programs include platform releases, Vitess upstream contributions, enterprise compliance certifications, infrastructure scaling, and serverless feature launches. The dual open-source/commercial coordination adds unique program management complexity.

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual Open-Source/Commercial Coordination:** "I coordinate programs across both PlanetScale's commercial platform and the Vitess open-source community. This dual-stakeholder coordination is uniquely complex."
2. **Database Release Rigor:** "Database platform releases require exceptional quality rigor — a bug in a release can cause data corruption across customer deployments."
3. **Enterprise Compliance Programs:** If managing SOC2/HIPAA programs, frame as revenue enabler.
4. **Google/MongoDB TPM Counter:** Both offer competitive TPM comp with liquid equity.
