**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at PlanetScale build the internal data infrastructure that processes platform telemetry, customer usage analytics, and performance metrics for the serverless MySQL platform. The meta-quality applies: you're a data engineer at a database company. The data engineering bar is inherently higher because your colleagues built the database engine. PlanetScale's serverless model generates rich usage data (query patterns, scaling events, branching activity) that drives product decisions and pricing optimization.

**Level Mapping:** PlanetScale Senior DE = CockroachDB DE = MongoDB DE = Google L4 DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Meta-Database Data Engineering:** "I'm a data engineer at a database company. The bar for data engineering is inherently higher when your colleagues are database engine developers."
2. **Serverless Usage Analytics:** "PlanetScale's serverless model generates unique usage data — scaling events, branching patterns, query workloads — that drives product and pricing decisions."
3. **Earlier-Stage Premium:** "PlanetScale at $1.2B needs a larger equity grant to compensate for risk."
4. **Snowflake/Databricks DE Counter:** Both pay higher with liquid equity for DE roles.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $220K over 4 years. I'm a data engineer at a database company — the standard is inherently higher." Counter at $185K-$210K equity is competitive.
