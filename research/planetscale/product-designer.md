### Product Designer | PlanetScale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($1.2B Valuation) | Serverless MySQL Platform (Vitess-based) | Open-Source Foundation | Higher Risk/Reward

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $155K–$215K | $70K–$200K | — | $195K–$315K |
| Remote US | $140K–$200K | $60K–$180K | — | $175K–$290K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at PlanetScale design the UX for a serverless MySQL platform. The design challenge is making complex database operations (branching, schema changes, sharding) feel as intuitive as Git workflows. PlanetScale's database branching feature — where schema changes are managed like Git branches — requires innovative UX paradigms that don't exist elsewhere. The design team is small, giving each designer significant product ownership. [Source: PlanetScale Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** PlanetScale Senior Designer = CockroachDB Senior Designer = MongoDB Senior Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Git-Like Database UX Innovation:** "PlanetScale's database branching is a UX paradigm that doesn't exist at other database companies. I'm inventing the interaction patterns for a new category of database workflow."
2. **Developer UX Expertise:** "Database UX requires deep understanding of developer workflows, SQL operations, and schema management."
3. **Small Team, Full Ownership:** "PlanetScale's design team is small enough that I own entire product surfaces."
4. **Figma/MongoDB Counter:** Both offer competitive design comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $190K over 4 years. I'm designing UX paradigms for database branching that don't exist anywhere else." Counter at $160K-$180K equity is competitive.
