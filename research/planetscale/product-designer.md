**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at PlanetScale design the UX for a serverless MySQL platform. The design challenge is making complex database operations (branching, schema changes, sharding) feel as intuitive as Git workflows. PlanetScale's database branching feature — where schema changes are managed like Git branches — requires innovative UX paradigms that don't exist elsewhere. The design team is small, giving each designer significant product ownership. [Source: PlanetScale Design Comp 2025-2026]
