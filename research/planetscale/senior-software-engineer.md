### Senior Software Engineer | PlanetScale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($1.2B Valuation) | Serverless MySQL Platform (Vitess-based) | Open-Source Foundation | Higher Risk/Reward

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $180K–$240K | $110K–$260K | — | $255K–$385K |
| Remote US | $165K–$225K | $95K–$240K | — | $235K–$355K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at PlanetScale own major subsystems of the serverless MySQL platform — Vitess sharding, query routing, database branching, schema change management, or serverless infrastructure. At PlanetScale's company size, senior engineers have company-wide architectural influence. The open-source Vitess foundation means contributions are publicly visible, building professional reputation. The $1.2B valuation creates higher risk/reward equity dynamics.

**Level Mapping:** PlanetScale Senior SWE = CockroachDB Senior SWE = MongoDB Senior SWE = Google L4

**Global Levers**

1. **Database Subsystem Ownership:** "I own major subsystems of a production database platform. At this level, my decisions affect data correctness and performance for every PlanetScale customer."
2. **Open-Source Visibility:** "My Vitess contributions are publicly visible on GitHub. This public technical leadership builds both PlanetScale's brand and my career."
3. **Earlier-Stage Premium:** "PlanetScale at $1.2B has significant growth potential. A 3-5x valuation increase is realistic, making my equity grant substantially more valuable."
4. **Cockroach Labs/MongoDB Counter:** Both offer equity at higher valuations or liquidity. Push for larger PlanetScale grant.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $250K over 4 years with acceleration. At senior level, I own database subsystems where correctness is non-negotiable, and the $1.2B valuation warrants a larger grant." Counter at $210K-$240K equity is strong.
