### Staff Software Engineer | PlanetScale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($1.2B Valuation) | Serverless MySQL Platform (Vitess-based) | Open-Source Foundation | Higher Risk/Reward

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $220K–$270K | $180K–$380K | — | $340K–$500K |
| Remote US | $205K–$255K | $160K–$350K | — | $315K–$465K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Engineers at PlanetScale are the technical leaders defining both the PlanetScale platform and the Vitess open-source project's direction. At a $1.2B company, Staff Engineers are effectively co-architects of the entire product. The intersection of Vitess open-source leadership and PlanetScale platform architecture is unique — Staff Engineers shape both the open-source ecosystem and the commercial product. The earlier-stage valuation means Staff-level equity grants have significant growth potential. [Source: PlanetScale Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** PlanetScale Staff SWE = CockroachDB Staff SWE = MongoDB Staff SWE = Google L5

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual Leadership (Open-Source + Platform):** "I'm a technical leader for both the Vitess open-source project and the PlanetScale commercial platform. This dual leadership role is unique in the database industry."
2. **Earlier-Stage Equity Growth:** "PlanetScale at $1.2B has significant valuation growth potential. A Staff-level equity grant at this valuation could appreciate 3-5x on a successful exit."
3. **Advisory-Level Terms:** "At Staff level with $1.2B valuation risk, I need advisory terms: 1-year exercise window, double-trigger acceleration, and a grant sized for growth potential."
4. **Google/Cockroach Labs Staff Counter:** Both offer competitive Staff comp. Push PlanetScale for a proportionally larger grant.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $480K total comp with equity at $360K over 4 years, advisory terms, and double-trigger acceleration. I'm leading both the open-source Vitess project and the PlanetScale platform." Counter at $310K-$350K equity with acceleration is competitive.
