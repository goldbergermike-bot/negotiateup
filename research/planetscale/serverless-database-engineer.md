### Serverless Database Engineer | PlanetScale Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($1.2B Valuation) | Serverless MySQL Platform (Vitess-based) | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | Open-Source Foundation

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $170K–$235K | $90K–$240K | — | $225K–$360K |
| Remote US | $155K–$220K | $80K–$220K | — | $210K–$335K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is PlanetScale's signature engineering role. Serverless Database Engineers build the serverless MySQL platform powered by Vitess — the open-source database clustering system originally created at YouTube to scale MySQL. PlanetScale is private ($1.2B valuation) and headquartered in San Francisco. The platform provides database branching (like Git branches for your database schema), non-blocking schema changes, and serverless scaling — capabilities that no other MySQL platform offers. Engineers at PlanetScale work on both the Vitess open-source project and the proprietary PlanetScale platform. [Source: PlanetScale Serverless DB Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** PlanetScale Serverless DB Eng (Senior) = Cockroach Labs Senior SWE = MongoDB Senior SWE = Google L4 (Vitess)

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Serverless Database Engineer works across PlanetScale's core technology:
- **Vitess Core:** Contributing to the open-source Vitess project — horizontal sharding, query routing, and connection pooling for MySQL
- **Database Branching:** Git-like branching workflows for database schemas — PlanetScale's signature feature
- **Non-Blocking Schema Changes:** Online DDL that allows schema migrations without downtime
- **Serverless Architecture:** Auto-scaling database compute and storage that adjusts to workload
- **Global Edge Deployment:** Edge-optimized database access for low-latency global applications

**Global Levers**

1. **Vitess + Serverless Innovation:** "PlanetScale combines Vitess (battle-tested at YouTube/Google scale) with serverless database innovation (branching, non-blocking schema changes). This combination is unique in the database market."
2. **Open-Source Reputation:** "My contributions to Vitess are publicly visible and build both PlanetScale's brand and my professional reputation."
3. **Smaller Company Equity Risk:** "PlanetScale at $1.2B is earlier-stage than Cockroach Labs ($5B) or MongoDB (public). I need a larger equity grant to compensate for the higher risk."
4. **Cockroach Labs/MongoDB Counter:** Both offer higher valuations or liquid equity. Frame: "CockroachDB offers equity at $5B valuation, and MongoDB offers liquid RSUs. PlanetScale's $1.2B valuation needs a proportionally larger equity grant."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $345K total comp with equity at $230K over 4 years and acceleration on change of control. I'm building the serverless MySQL platform on Vitess — a unique position in the database market. I have offers from Cockroach Labs and MongoDB." Counter at $195K-$220K equity with acceleration is competitive.
