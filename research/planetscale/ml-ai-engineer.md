**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at PlanetScale build intelligent database features — serverless autoscaling models, query performance prediction, automatic index recommendations, and schema optimization suggestions. The serverless model creates unique ML challenges: predicting workload patterns to scale proactively while minimizing cost. The intersection of ML expertise and database internals knowledge is extremely rare. [Source: PlanetScale ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Serverless Autoscaling ML:** "My ML models power serverless autoscaling — predicting workload patterns to scale database resources proactively. This directly impacts both cost efficiency and performance."
2. **ML + Database Intersection:** "The intersection of ML expertise and MySQL/Vitess database internals is exceptionally rare."
3. **Self-Managing Database Vision:** "My ML features make PlanetScale databases self-managing — automatically optimizing queries, recommending indexes, and scaling resources."
4. **Google/Anthropic Counter:** "AI companies offer $400K+ for ML engineers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $350K total comp with equity at $235K over 4 years. ML + database internals is the rarest skill intersection in systems engineering." Counter at $200K-$225K equity is competitive.
