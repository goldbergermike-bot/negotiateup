#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $145,000–$190,000 | $80,000–$170,000 | $225,000–$360,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $155,000–$205,000 | $90,000–$190,000 | $245,000–$395,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £85,000–£120,000 | £45,000–£95,000 | £130,000–£215,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Managers at Flywire are the translators between CEO David King's Invisible Pay vision and the engineering teams building it. You define what "invisible" means for each vertical — what the student experience looks like when tuition payment disappears, what the patient experience looks like when healthcare billing becomes seamless, what the traveler experience looks like when cross-border payment is frictionless. The Feb 3 Simovative partnership adds new verticals to your product portfolio, expanding your scope and impact. PMs at Flywire carry broader domain responsibility than PMs at horizontal payment processors because you must deeply understand the vertical workflow your payment product embeds into. This vertical product expertise commands a significant premium.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| PM (L4-L5) | PM / Product Manager | Product Manager | Product Manager |
| Senior PM (L5-L6) | Senior PM | Senior Product Manager | Senior PM |

- Stripe PMs typically earn 15–25% more in base cash; counter with Flywire's RSU upside and vertical product ownership breadth.
- Adyen PMs in Amsterdam have narrower product scope; Flywire PMs own cross-vertical payment experiences.
- The "Invisible Pay" product vision is a once-in-career opportunity to define an entirely new product paradigm — use this as a non-monetary negotiation lever.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: David King's February 2026 predictions about invisible and adaptive payments represent a product management inflection point. PMs must redefine the payment UX from an explicit transaction step to an invisible background process. This requires deep user research, vertical-specific journey mapping, and cross-functional leadership to ensure engineering, design, and compliance teams align on what "invisible" means for each vertical. PMs who can drive this redefinition are rare and valuable.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The Simovative partnership expands Flywire's vertical footprint into new embedded payment scenarios. For Product Managers, this means scoping new product requirements, defining integration specifications, and prioritizing roadmap items for an expanding set of vertical partners. Each new partnership is a new product surface area — and a new proof point for your expanding organizational impact.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: Flywire PMs are Vertical Intelligence product strategists. You don't just manage a payment product; you manage the intersection of payment technology and vertical domain expertise. Understanding how tuition billing works in 240+ countries, how healthcare adjudication varies by insurer, or how travel agency settlement flows operate — this domain knowledge is your product moat and your negotiation leverage.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: PMs benefit from the Invisible Pay transformation because the product vision is being actively redefined. You're not inheriting a stable product — you're shaping the future of invisible payments across verticals. This greenfield product definition work is the highest-impact PM work and justifies premium compensation.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Cross-Vertical Product Ownership**
> "As a PM at Flywire, I'll own payment experiences across education, healthcare, and travel verticals — each requiring deep domain understanding and distinct user journey design. This cross-vertical product ownership scope exceeds what PMs typically own at single-product payment companies, and I'd like compensation that reflects this breadth."

**Lever 2: Invisible Pay Product Definition**
> "David King's Feb 2026 Invisible Pay vision requires PMs who can redefine the entire payment UX paradigm. I'll be defining what 'invisible payments' means in practice — the user research, the journey mapping, the product specs. This is foundational product work that will shape Flywire's competitive position for years. I'd like an offer that reflects the strategic importance of this product definition work."

**Lever 3: Partnership Expansion Scope**
> "The Simovative partnership and Flywire's embedded payment strategy mean my product scope will expand significantly as new vertical partnerships launch. I'd like compensation that anticipates this growing scope rather than just reflecting day-one responsibilities."

**Lever 4: Competing PM Offers**
> "I'm evaluating PM offers from Stripe and other payment platforms where total comp starts at $X. Flywire's Vertical Intelligence thesis is compelling, but I need the offer to be competitive to move forward."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Boston, start at $185,000 base + $160,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $155,000 base + $95,000 RSU/4yr. For New York, start at $200,000 base + $180,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $165,000 base + $105,000 RSU/4yr. For London, start at £115,000 base + £90,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than £90,000 base + £55,000 RSU/4yr. PMs should specifically negotiate for product conference budget and executive visibility opportunities as non-monetary levers.
