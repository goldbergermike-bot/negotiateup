#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $150,000–$200,000 | $70,000–$140,000 | $220,000–$340,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $160,000–$215,000 | $80,000–$155,000 | $240,000–$370,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £90,000–£135,000 | £40,000–£80,000 | £130,000–£215,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Solutions Architects at Flywire are the bridge between the Invisible Pay platform and the institutions that adopt it. You translate CEO David King's Feb 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments into concrete implementation architectures for universities, hospitals, and enterprises. Every solution you design determines how deeply Flywire's Vertical Intelligence embeds into a client's workflow — and deeper integration means higher retention, larger deal sizes, and stronger competitive moats. The Feb 3 Simovative partnership adds new vertical integration scenarios to your solution portfolio. SAs who can architect invisible payment experiences across multiple verticals and 240+ countries are rare and command premium compensation.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Solutions Architect (L4-L5) | Solutions Architect L3 | Solutions Engineer | Solutions Architect |
| Senior Solutions Architect (L5-L6) | Senior SA L4 | Senior Solutions Engineer | Senior SA |

- Stripe SAs earn competitive base plus meaningful variable compensation; ensure your Flywire offer includes variable/bonus tied to implementation success.
- Flywire SAs must understand multi-vertical payment workflows (education, healthcare, travel) — broader domain scope than single-vertical SAs at competitors.
- Salesforce SA comp ($250K–$400K TC at senior levels) is an appropriate upper anchor given the enterprise, client-facing nature of the role.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: David King's February 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments redefines the Solutions Architect role. Previously, SAs helped clients integrate payment processing. Now, SAs must design solutions where payments disappear entirely into the client's vertical workflow — where a university's enrollment system, a hospital's patient intake, or a travel platform's booking flow seamlessly incorporates invisible payment orchestration. This is solution design at a fundamentally higher level of complexity.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The Simovative partnership creates new solution architecture challenges — designing how Flywire's payment intelligence embeds into partner vertical platforms. Solutions Architects must create reference architectures, integration blueprints, and implementation playbooks for an expanding ecosystem of vertical partnerships. Each new partnership is a new solution surface area and a new revenue opportunity you directly enable.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: Solutions Architects are the external face of Flywire's Vertical Intelligence. You translate deep domain expertise — understanding tuition billing, healthcare payment cycles, travel settlement — into implementation architectures that make clients dependent on Flywire's intelligence layer. The more deeply you embed Flywire's Vertical Intelligence into client workflows, the stronger the competitive moat.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: Solutions Architects benefit from the Invisible Pay transformation because invisible payments require deeper, more sophisticated client integrations. Deeper integrations mean larger deal sizes, more complex solution design, and greater SA impact. Your revenue attribution grows as payments become more invisible and more embedded.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Revenue-Driving Solution Design**
> "Every solution I architect directly impacts Flywire's revenue — deeper integrations drive larger deal sizes and higher retention. With David King's Invisible Pay vision requiring more sophisticated client integrations, my revenue impact is growing. I'd like compensation that reflects the direct revenue attribution of this role."

**Lever 2: Multi-Vertical Solution Expertise**
> "I'll be designing solutions for education, healthcare, and travel clients — each with distinct regulatory, workflow, and integration requirements. This multi-vertical solution expertise is significantly rarer than single-vertical SA skills. I'd expect my offer to reflect the breadth of domain knowledge required."

**Lever 3: Partnership Architecture Scope**
> "The Simovative partnership and Flywire's embedded strategy expand my role from client-facing SA to partner ecosystem architect. Designing reference architectures and integration blueprints for vertical partners adds significant scope beyond traditional solution design. I'd like compensation that reflects this expanded mandate."

**Lever 4: Competing SA Offers**
> "I'm evaluating Solutions Architect offers from Stripe and Salesforce where total comp packages reach $X. Flywire's Invisible Pay thesis is uniquely compelling from a solution design perspective, but the comp needs to be competitive for me to commit."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Boston, start at $195,000 base + $135,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $160,000 base + $80,000 RSU/4yr. For New York, start at $210,000 base + $150,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $170,000 base + $90,000 RSU/4yr. For London, start at £130,000 base + £75,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than £95,000 base + £45,000 RSU/4yr. SAs should negotiate for variable compensation tied to implementation revenue, travel budget, and client-facing presentation equipment as non-monetary levers.
