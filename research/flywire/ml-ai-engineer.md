### ML/AI Engineer — Flywire Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Flywire's Invisible Pay transformation, translating the Feb 2026 David King predictions and Feb 3 Simovative partnership into an ML/AI engineering compensation framework spanning Boston, New York, and London markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $165,000–$225,000 | $100,000–$200,000 | $265,000–$425,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $175,000–$240,000 | $110,000–$220,000 | $285,000–$460,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £100,000–£150,000 | £55,000–£110,000 | £155,000–£260,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers at Flywire build the intelligent core of the Invisible Pay platform. CEO David King's Feb 2026 prediction of adaptive payments — payments that automatically adjust to context, currency, regulation, and user behavior in real time — is an ML/AI engineering deliverable. You design and deploy the models that power adaptive payment routing, dynamic currency optimization, vertical-specific fraud detection, predictive payment flow analysis, and personalized payment experiences across 240+ countries. The Feb 3 Simovative partnership introduces new vertical ML problems. ML/AI engineers who can build production models on vertical payment data are in extremely high demand, and Flywire competes for this talent against Google, Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, and every well-funded AI startup. Your negotiation position is exceptionally strong.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| ML/AI Engineer (L4-L5) | ML Engineer L2-L3 | Data Scientist / ML Engineer | ML Engineer |
| Senior ML/AI Engineer (L5-L6) | Senior ML Engineer L3-L4 | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer |

- Google ML Engineers (L5) earn $400K–$550K TC; use this as your upper anchor.
- Stripe ML Engineers earn competitive comp; Flywire's multi-vertical ML challenge and RSU upside can justify parity.
- ML/AI talent market is the most competitive in tech; leverage this structural scarcity in every negotiation.
- Flywire's unique advantage for ML engineers: production ML on real vertical payment data with direct revenue impact (not research ML).

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: David King's February 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments is, at its technical core, an ML/AI vision. "Adaptive" means models that learn from payment patterns, adjust routing in real time, optimize currency conversion dynamically, and personalize payment experiences based on user context and vertical workflow stage. ML/AI Engineers are building the brain of the Invisible Pay platform. King's vision elevates ML/AI from a supporting function to the central product capability.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The Simovative partnership introduces new vertical domains for ML modeling. ML/AI Engineers must build models that transfer learning across verticals (education, healthcare, travel, and now Simovative's domains) while maintaining vertical-specific accuracy. Cross-vertical transfer learning on payment data is a novel and technically demanding ML challenge that distinguishes this role from generic ML engineering.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: Flywire's Vertical Intelligence is, at its deepest level, ML intelligence. The models that understand tuition payment timing, predict healthcare billing outcomes, and optimize travel payment routing encode domain knowledge into algorithms. ML/AI Engineers who build these vertical-specific models are creating Flywire's most defensible competitive asset — algorithmic domain expertise that no horizontal processor can replicate.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: ML/AI Engineers benefit disproportionately from the Invisible Pay transformation because the word "adaptive" in David King's vision is an ML/AI deliverable. Every expansion of the adaptive payment capability — new verticals, new currencies, new partner integrations — requires new ML models. Your organizational importance and compensation trajectory scale directly with the ambition of the Invisible Pay vision.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Adaptive Payments = ML/AI Core Product**
> "David King's Feb 2026 vision of adaptive payments is fundamentally an ML/AI product. The models I build for adaptive routing, dynamic optimization, and contextual payment intelligence ARE the Invisible Pay platform. I'd like compensation that reflects the fact that ML/AI is the core product capability, not a supporting function."

**Lever 2: Structural ML/AI Talent Scarcity**
> "ML/AI engineers are the most competitive hire in tech. I'm evaluating opportunities at Google, Stripe, and AI-native companies where total comp ranges from $X to $Y. Flywire's vertical payment ML problems are uniquely interesting, but the comp must be competitive with these alternatives."

**Lever 3: Multi-Vertical ML Complexity**
> "Building ML models that work across education, healthcare, travel, and expanding verticals — each with distinct data distributions, feature spaces, and business objectives — requires rare multi-domain ML expertise. I'd expect compensation to reflect this multi-vertical modeling complexity."

**Lever 4: Revenue-Facing Model Impact**
> "My models will directly drive payment conversion rates, fraud reduction, and currency optimization — each with quantifiable P&L impact. I'd like an RSU package that aligns my compensation with the revenue impact of production ML models, not generic ML research compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Boston, start at $220,000 base + $190,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $175,000 base + $110,000 RSU/4yr. For New York, start at $235,000 base + $210,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $185,000 base + $125,000 RSU/4yr. For London, start at £145,000 base + £105,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than £108,000 base + £60,000 RSU/4yr. ML/AI engineers should negotiate for GPU/compute budget, conference attendance (NeurIPS, ICML, KDD), publication rights, and continued learning budgets as non-monetary levers.
