### Security Engineer — Flywire Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Flywire's Invisible Pay transformation, translating the Feb 2026 David King predictions and Feb 3 Simovative partnership into a security engineering compensation framework spanning Boston, New York, and London markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $155,000–$205,000 | $70,000–$140,000 | $225,000–$345,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $165,000–$220,000 | $80,000–$155,000 | $245,000–$375,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £90,000–£135,000 | £40,000–£80,000 | £130,000–£215,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Security Engineers at Flywire protect a payment intelligence platform that processes transactions across 240+ countries spanning education, healthcare, travel, and B2B verticals — each with distinct regulatory and compliance requirements. CEO David King's Feb 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments dramatically expands the security surface: invisible payments mean invisible trust, and any security failure makes the invisible catastrophically visible. The Feb 3 Simovative partnership introduces partner integration security challenges. You secure not just a payment network but a Vertical Intelligence platform handling sensitive student data (FERPA considerations), patient financial data (HIPAA adjacency), and enterprise transaction data (SOX, PCI-DSS). Security engineers who understand multi-vertical, multi-regulatory payment security are among the rarest and most valuable talent in fintech.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Security Engineer (L4) | Security Engineer L2 | Security Engineer | Security Engineer |
| Senior Security Engineer (L5) | Senior Security Eng L3 | Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Engineer |

- Stripe Security Engineers earn competitive base plus strong RSU; Flywire's multi-vertical compliance complexity (PCI-DSS + FERPA + HIPAA adjacency) justifies parity or premium.
- Security talent is in structural shortage across fintech; use this macro scarcity in every negotiation conversation.
- Google and Meta security engineering comp ($300K–$450K TC at senior levels) are legitimate upper anchors given the critical nature of payment security.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: David King's February 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments creates a security paradox: the more invisible payments become, the more critical security becomes. Users who don't see the payment can't verify the payment — which means Flywire's security infrastructure must be absolutely trustworthy. Adaptive payments that dynamically route across currencies and regulations introduce new attack vectors that Security Engineers must anticipate and mitigate. The Invisible Pay vision is only viable if security is flawless.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The Simovative partnership extends Flywire's security perimeter into partner platforms. Security Engineers must ensure that embedded payment flows in third-party vertical software maintain Flywire's security standards. Partner integration security — API authentication, data encryption in transit and at rest across partner boundaries, supply chain security — adds significant scope to the security engineering mandate.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: Flywire's Vertical Intelligence platform handles data across verticals with distinct security requirements. Student financial records require different protections than healthcare billing data, which differs from travel transaction data. Security Engineers must build security architectures that are both vertically specific (meeting each vertical's compliance requirements) and horizontally consistent (maintaining platform-wide security posture). This vertical security intelligence is extraordinarily difficult to build and maintain.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: Security Engineers benefit from the Invisible Pay transformation because the security threat surface is expanding with every new vertical, every new partnership, and every new invisible payment flow. More surface area = more security investment = more organizational importance for your role. The asymmetric risk profile (breach cost >> security investment) gives you powerful negotiation leverage.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Asymmetric Risk Protection**
> "A security breach at Flywire would cost hundreds of millions in fines, client attrition, and reputational damage across education, healthcare, and travel clients. My role prevents that catastrophic outcome. The asymmetric value I provide — the gap between breach cost and my compensation — justifies top-of-market pay."

**Lever 2: Multi-Regulatory Security Complexity**
> "I'm securing a platform that must comply with PCI-DSS, navigate FERPA considerations for student data, address HIPAA adjacency for healthcare billing, and meet data protection regulations across 240+ countries. This multi-regulatory security scope is dramatically broader than single-vertical fintech security. I'd expect compensation to reflect that complexity."

**Lever 3: Partner Security Perimeter Expansion**
> "The Simovative partnership and Flywire's embedded payment strategy extend my security perimeter into partner platforms. Securing payment flows that traverse partner boundaries requires API security architecture, cross-platform encryption standards, and supply chain security expertise. This expanded perimeter justifies expanded compensation."

**Lever 4: Security Talent Scarcity**
> "Fintech security engineers are in structural shortage, and engineers who understand multi-vertical payment security across regulated industries are even rarer. I have competing offers at $X. Flywire's Invisible Pay security challenges are uniquely interesting, but the offer must reflect market scarcity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Boston, start at $200,000 base + $135,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $165,000 base + $80,000 RSU/4yr. For New York, start at $215,000 base + $150,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $175,000 base + $90,000 RSU/4yr. For London, start at £130,000 base + £75,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than £98,000 base + £45,000 RSU/4yr. Security engineers should negotiate for security certification reimbursement (CISSP, OSCP), conference attendance (Black Hat, DEF CON), and on-call compensation as non-monetary levers.
