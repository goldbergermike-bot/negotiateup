#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $175,000–$220,000 | $120,000–$240,000 | $295,000–$460,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $185,000–$235,000 | $140,000–$270,000 | $325,000–$505,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £100,000–£140,000 | £70,000–£135,000 | £170,000–£275,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering Managers at Flywire sit at the intersection of technical strategy and people leadership during the company's most transformative period. CEO David King's Feb 2026 Invisible Pay vision requires not just brilliant engineers but brilliant engineering teams — and you are the one who builds, scales, and retains those teams. The Feb 3 Simovative partnership and expansion into new verticals means your team's scope is growing, your hiring responsibility is increasing, and your organizational impact is multiplying. EMs at vertical payment platforms like Flywire command a premium over generic fintech EM roles because you must understand domain-specific complexity (education regulations, healthcare billing, travel settlement) deeply enough to make sound technical prioritization decisions while simultaneously managing talent in a competitive market.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| EM (L5) | EM / M1 | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager |
| Senior EM (L6) | Senior EM / M2 | Senior Engineering Manager | Senior EM |

- Stripe EMs (M1) in NYC typically earn $350K–$500K TC; use this range as your upper anchor.
- Flywire EMs manage teams spanning multiple verticals, giving broader scope than single-product EMs at Adyen or Checkout.com.
- London EM compensation at Checkout.com (£150K–£250K TC) is the most direct comparable for Flywire London.
- The multi-vertical management complexity at Flywire (balancing education, healthcare, travel engineering priorities) justifies a scope premium.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: David King's February 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments creates an inflection point for Engineering Managers. The Invisible Pay transformation requires re-organizing engineering teams around platform capabilities rather than vertical silos, hiring engineers with rare cross-domain skills, and driving execution velocity on a fundamental platform re-architecture. EMs who can lead through this transformation are exceptionally valuable.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The Simovative partnership means new vertical integrations, new team capacity needs, and new cross-functional coordination challenges. Engineering Managers must scale their teams to support an expanding partnership ecosystem while maintaining velocity on the core Invisible Pay platform. This expanding scope strengthens your negotiation position — you're not managing a steady-state team, you're building and scaling a team through a period of rapid growth.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: Flywire's Vertical Intelligence moat depends on retaining and growing world-class engineering talent. As an Engineering Manager, you are the steward of that talent pipeline. Your ability to recruit, develop, and retain engineers who understand vertical payment complexity directly impacts Flywire's competitive position. This makes your role strategically critical in ways that generic EM roles are not.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: Engineering Managers benefit from the Invisible Pay transformation because team growth = scope growth = compensation growth. As Flywire expands into new verticals via partnerships like Simovative, EM headcount and budget authority increase, creating natural promotion and compensation escalation paths.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Multi-Vertical Team Leadership**
> "I'll be leading engineering teams that ship across education, healthcare, and travel verticals simultaneously — each with distinct regulatory, compliance, and domain requirements. This multi-vertical management scope is significantly broader than leading a single-product engineering team, and I'd expect compensation to reflect that leadership complexity."

**Lever 2: Talent War Premium**
> "Recruiting and retaining engineers who understand vertical payment intelligence is one of Flywire's biggest challenges. As an EM, I'm directly responsible for winning that talent war. My compensation should reflect the strategic value of building and retaining the team that executes David King's Invisible Pay vision."

**Lever 3: Organizational Scaling During Transformation**
> "The Simovative partnership and vertical expansion mean my team will grow significantly during my first year. I'd like compensation that reflects the target-state team size and scope, not just the day-one team, since I'll be doing the hardest leadership work — scaling an org through a platform transformation — from the start."

**Lever 4: Competing EM Offers**
> "I have EM offers from Stripe and Checkout.com with total comp packages at $X. I'm drawn to Flywire's Vertical Intelligence mission and the opportunity to lead through the Invisible Pay transformation. I need the total comp to be competitive so I can commit fully."
