### DevOps Engineer — Flywire Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Flywire's Invisible Pay transformation, translating the Feb 2026 David King predictions and Feb 3 Simovative partnership into a DevOps engineering compensation framework spanning Boston, New York, and London markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $140,000–$185,000 | $60,000–$120,000 | $200,000–$305,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $150,000–$200,000 | $70,000–$135,000 | $220,000–$335,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £80,000–£115,000 | £35,000–£70,000 | £115,000–£185,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: DevOps Engineers at Flywire are the infrastructure architects who make the Invisible Pay vision operationally possible. CEO David King's Feb 2026 prediction of invisible and adaptive payments can only materialize if the underlying infrastructure is rock-solid, auto-scaling, and globally distributed. You are responsible for the CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and deployment automation that ensure Flywire's payment intelligence layer operates at 99.99%+ uptime across 240+ countries. The Feb 3 Simovative partnership adds new integration infrastructure requirements. When payments become invisible, any infrastructure failure becomes catastrophically visible — which makes your role both high-stakes and high-leverage for negotiation purposes.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| DevOps Engineer (L4) | Infrastructure Engineer L2 | Platform Engineer | DevOps Engineer |
| Senior DevOps Engineer (L5) | Senior Infrastructure Eng L3 | Senior Platform Engineer | Senior DevOps Engineer |

- Stripe Infrastructure Engineers earn 15–25% more in base; counter with Flywire's multi-vertical infrastructure complexity and RSU upside.
- Flywire DevOps roles span payment processing infrastructure AND vertical application infrastructure — dual mandate that Adyen or Checkout.com DevOps roles don't carry.
- Google SRE and Stripe Infrastructure Engineer comp are appropriate upper anchors for Flywire DevOps negotiations.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: David King's February 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments places enormous demands on infrastructure. Payments that are invisible must be infallible — if an invisible payment fails, the entire vertical workflow (enrollment, healthcare intake, travel booking) breaks down. DevOps Engineers must build infrastructure that is self-healing, auto-scaling, and globally consistent. The "adaptive" component requires infrastructure that can dynamically route traffic, scale compute resources in real-time, and support rapid deployment of new vertical-specific payment logic.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The Simovative partnership requires new deployment pipelines, integration infrastructure, and monitoring for partner-embedded payment flows. DevOps Engineers must extend Flywire's infrastructure to support third-party platform integrations while maintaining the same reliability and security standards. Each new partnership adds infrastructure surface area that you manage.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: Flywire's Vertical Intelligence depends on infrastructure that supports vertical-specific deployment patterns, data isolation requirements, and regulatory compliance across jurisdictions. DevOps Engineers who understand how to build infrastructure that serves education, healthcare, and travel verticals — each with distinct compliance and performance requirements — are building the operational foundation of Flywire's moat.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: DevOps Engineers benefit from the Invisible Pay transformation because infrastructure investment always increases during platform transformations. More verticals, more partnerships, more invisible payment flows — all require more infrastructure, more automation, and more DevOps expertise. Your organizational importance grows with every expansion.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Zero-Downtime Payment Infrastructure**
> "Invisible payments require infallible infrastructure. If a payment fails when it's supposed to be invisible, the entire vertical workflow breaks for the end user. I'm responsible for maintaining 99.99%+ uptime across a global payment network serving education, healthcare, and travel — that reliability mandate justifies premium compensation."

**Lever 2: Multi-Vertical Infrastructure Complexity**
> "Flywire's infrastructure must serve multiple regulated verticals — each with distinct compliance, data residency, and performance requirements — simultaneously. This is significantly more complex than operating infrastructure for a single-product payment processor. I'd expect compensation that reflects this multi-vertical infrastructure scope."

**Lever 3: Partnership Integration Infrastructure**
> "The Simovative partnership and Flywire's embedded payment strategy require me to build and maintain integration infrastructure that extends into partner platforms. This partner infrastructure work expands my scope beyond traditional DevOps and into platform engineering territory. I'd like compensation that reflects this expanded mandate."

**Lever 4: Competing Infrastructure Offers**
> "I'm evaluating infrastructure and DevOps roles at Stripe and cloud-native companies where total comp starts at $X. Flywire's Invisible Pay infrastructure challenges are uniquely compelling, but the offer needs to be competitive for me to commit."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Boston, start at $180,000 base + $115,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $150,000 base + $70,000 RSU/4yr. For New York, start at $195,000 base + $130,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $160,000 base + $80,000 RSU/4yr. For London, start at £110,000 base + £65,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than £88,000 base + £40,000 RSU/4yr. DevOps engineers should negotiate for on-call compensation, home office setup budget, and cloud certification reimbursement as non-monetary levers.
