### Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer — Flywire Salary Negotiation Guide

# **SIGNATURE ROLE**

> This is the **SIGNATURE ROLE** for the Flywire Negotiate Up series — the role that most directly embodies Flywire's transformation from payment processor to invisible payment intelligence platform. The Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer is the architect of Flywire's future: the person who designs, builds, and scales the platform layer that makes payments invisible across every vertical Flywire serves. This guide is written at extended length to reflect the outsized importance and compensation leverage this role commands.

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Flywire's Invisible Pay transformation, translating the Feb 2026 David King predictions and Feb 3 Simovative partnership into the ultimate Flywire-specific compensation framework for the Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer — spanning Boston, New York, and London markets. This is the role that sits at the exact center of Flywire's strategic transformation, and the negotiation leverage is commensurate.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $195,000–$255,000 | $200,000–$380,000 | $395,000–$635,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $210,000–$275,000 | $220,000–$420,000 | $430,000–$695,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £120,000–£170,000 | £110,000–£210,000 | £230,000–£380,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer is Flywire's most strategically important technical role. You are not building features within a vertical — you are building the platform that makes every vertical possible. CEO David King's Feb 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments is a platform engineering vision: a single, intelligent platform layer that adapts to education, healthcare, travel, B2B, and every future vertical that partnerships like Simovative unlock. This platform must handle multi-currency orchestration across 240+ countries, embed domain-specific intelligence into payment flows, adapt dynamically to regulatory requirements, and make all of this invisible to end users.

The rarity of engineers who can operate at this intersection — platform engineering + vertical domain intelligence + global payment orchestration + adaptive ML systems — makes this among the most difficult roles to fill in all of fintech. Flywire is competing for this talent against Stripe's platform engineering team, Google's payment infrastructure team, Adyen's core platform, and every ambitious vertical SaaS company building payment capabilities. Your negotiation leverage is exceptional because the role is existential: without the Vertical Intelligence Platform, Flywire's entire Invisible Pay transformation stalls.

This SIGNATURE ROLE guide provides the most comprehensive negotiation framework in the Flywire series, because the compensation opportunity is the largest and the strategic leverage is the strongest.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com | Equivalent at Google |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| VI Platform Engineer (L5-L6) | L3-L4 Platform Eng | Senior Platform Engineer | Senior Platform Engineer | L5-L6 SWE |
| Senior VI Platform Engineer (L6-L7) | L4-L5 Staff Platform Eng | Principal Platform Engineer | Staff Platform Engineer | L6-L7 SWE |

**Detailed Level Analysis**:

- **Stripe L4 (Staff) Platform Engineers** earn $500K–$650K TC in NYC. This is your primary benchmark because the platform engineering scope is most comparable — but Flywire's multi-vertical complexity exceeds Stripe's single-product platform.
- **Google L6 SWEs** in payments infrastructure earn $450K–$600K TC. Google's payment platform operates at larger scale but narrower vertical scope. Use Google comp as a floor, not a ceiling, for Flywire's multi-vertical platform role.
- **Adyen Principal Platform Engineers** in Amsterdam earn competitive European compensation; use their London presence for GBP benchmarking.
- **Checkout.com Staff Platform Engineers** in London are the closest comparable for Flywire London offers, though Flywire's vertical breadth exceeds Checkout.com's scope.
- The critical differentiator: no other company requires platform engineers to build a single platform that serves education, healthcare, travel, and B2B verticals simultaneously while making payments invisible. This cross-vertical platform scope has no direct market equivalent, which means you are justified in requesting above-market compensation.

**Internal Progression Path**: The Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer role is a natural progression path from Senior Software Engineer or Staff Software Engineer roles at Flywire. However, it carries broader cross-functional scope than a traditional Staff SWE because it requires platform-level thinking that spans all verticals, all geographies, and all downstream consumers (application engineers, data scientists, ML engineers, partner integrations). This expanded scope justifies compensation at or above the Staff SWE band.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**This is the definitive section for this SIGNATURE ROLE — the Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer is the living embodiment of the Invisible Pay and Vertical Intelligence thesis.**

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments (Deep Analysis)**:

In February 2026, Flywire CEO David King made a series of public predictions that fundamentally reframed the company's strategic direction. King predicted that payments would become invisible — disappearing entirely from the user's conscious experience — and adaptive — automatically adjusting to context, currency, regulation, user preference, and vertical workflow in real time. These predictions were not aspirational marketing; they were engineering mandates.

For the Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer, King's predictions translate into concrete platform requirements:

1. **Invisible Payment Orchestration Layer**: You must build a platform layer that intercepts payment events across vertical workflows (enrollment, patient intake, booking) and handles payment orchestration — currency conversion, regulatory routing, fraud checking, settlement — entirely in the background. The end user never sees a "payment page." Payment happens as a seamless, invisible part of their vertical workflow.

2. **Adaptive Decision Engine**: You must build or integrate real-time decision engines that adapt payment handling based on dozens of contextual signals — user geography, institution preferences, regulatory requirements, currency volatility, fraud risk scores, vertical-specific business rules. This adaptive layer is what distinguishes Flywire from static payment processors.

3. **Cross-Vertical Platform Abstraction**: You must design platform primitives (APIs, SDKs, data models, event schemas) that abstract away vertical-specific complexity while allowing vertical teams to customize behavior. A single platform call should handle a $50,000 tuition payment from Nigeria and a $500 healthcare co-pay from London with equal invisibility and adaptive intelligence.

4. **Global Regulatory Intelligence**: The platform must encode regulatory intelligence for 240+ countries — knowing which payment methods are available, which currencies are permitted, what documentation is required, and how settlement timing works — and apply this intelligence invisibly to every transaction.

David King's predictions put the Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer at the absolute center of Flywire's transformation. Without this platform, there are no invisible payments. Without adaptive intelligence, Flywire remains a static payment processor. Every dollar of investment in the Invisible Pay vision flows through the platform you build.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership (Deep Analysis)**:

The February 3, 2026 partnership with Simovative is a critical validation of the Vertical Intelligence Platform thesis. Simovative operates in new vertical domains, and the partnership demonstrates that Flywire's platform must be extensible to verticals beyond its original education-healthcare-travel core.

For the Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer, the Simovative partnership creates specific platform requirements:

1. **Partner Integration Framework**: You must build a scalable partner integration framework that allows third-party vertical platforms to embed Flywire's invisible payment intelligence. This framework must handle authentication, data exchange, event routing, and settlement orchestration across partner boundaries — all while maintaining Flywire's security, compliance, and reliability standards.

2. **Vertical Extensibility Architecture**: The platform must support rapid onboarding of new verticals without core platform changes. When the next Simovative-style partnership launches, the Vertical Intelligence Platform should require configuration, not code changes, to support the new vertical's payment patterns.

3. **Embedded Intelligence SDK**: You must design SDKs that allow partner vertical platforms to invoke Flywire's adaptive payment intelligence with minimal integration effort. The SDK must abstract platform complexity into simple, developer-friendly interfaces that make integration measured in days, not months.

4. **Multi-Partner Orchestration**: As the partnership ecosystem grows, the platform must handle scenarios where multiple partners interact — cross-vertical payment flows, shared settlement, multi-party reconciliation. This multi-partner orchestration is a platform architecture challenge that only the Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer can solve.

The Simovative partnership proves that Flywire's future depends on a platform that scales horizontally across verticals. Every new partnership validates the platform investment and increases the organizational importance of the Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer role.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning (Deep Analysis)**:

Flywire's competitive moat is not payment processing — dozens of companies can process payments. Flywire's moat is Vertical Intelligence: the deep domain knowledge encoded into software that makes payments context-aware, invisible, and adaptive within specific vertical workflows.

The Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer builds the technical foundation of this moat:

- **Domain Knowledge Encoding**: You design the data models, business rule engines, and workflow abstractions that capture how tuition billing works across 240+ countries, how healthcare adjudication varies by insurer and jurisdiction, how travel settlement patterns differ by booking type and geography. This encoded domain knowledge is what makes Flywire's payments intelligent.

- **Intelligence Reuse Across Verticals**: The platform enables intelligence built for one vertical to enhance others. Fraud patterns learned in education can improve healthcare fraud detection. Currency optimization techniques from travel can accelerate B2B settlement. The platform's cross-vertical architecture enables this intelligence transfer.

- **Competitive Defensibility**: Because the Vertical Intelligence Platform encodes years of domain expertise into platform primitives, it creates a technical moat that competitors cannot replicate by simply processing more transactions. They would need to rebuild the domain intelligence from scratch — a multi-year, multi-vertical endeavor. You are building the artifact that makes Flywire defensible.

**Role-Specific Benefit (SIGNATURE ROLE Extended Analysis)**:

The Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer benefits from the Invisible Pay transformation more than any other role at Flywire, for three interconnected reasons:

1. **Platform Centrality**: Every invisible payment, every adaptive decision, every new vertical integration flows through the platform you build. Your work is the foundation that every other engineering team at Flywire builds on. This centrality translates directly into organizational influence and compensation leverage.

2. **Expanding Scope**: Every new vertical (via partnerships like Simovative), every new country, and every new adaptive payment capability increases the platform's scope — and your scope. Unlike application-level roles where scope can plateau, the platform's scope is structurally expansive. Your negotiation leverage grows with every Flywire expansion.

3. **Irreplaceability**: The combination of platform engineering expertise, vertical domain knowledge, global payment orchestration experience, and adaptive systems design is so rare that finding a replacement for a Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer takes 6–12 months. This irreplaceability is your strongest long-term negotiation asset — not just at hiring, but at every subsequent review cycle.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Platform Centrality Premium**
> "Every invisible payment Flywire processes, every adaptive decision the system makes, and every new vertical partnership integration runs through the platform I build. The Vertical Intelligence Platform is the foundational infrastructure of David King's Feb 2026 Invisible Pay vision. I'd like compensation that reflects the centrality of this platform to Flywire's entire strategic transformation — not just my individual contributions, but the fact that every other engineering team's output depends on my platform."

**Lever 2: Cross-Vertical Platform Architecture Scarcity**
> "Engineers who can design platform architecture that spans education, healthcare, travel, B2B, and emerging verticals — making payments invisible across all of them with a single, adaptive platform layer — are extraordinarily rare. This isn't single-product platform engineering; it's multi-vertical platform intelligence. I'm benchmarking against Stripe Staff Platform Engineer and Google L6 payment infrastructure comp, and I expect Flywire to match or exceed given the broader scope."

**Lever 3: Simovative Partnership & Ecosystem Expansion**
> "The Feb 3, 2026 Simovative partnership validates that my platform must be extensible to new verticals at partnership speed. Every new partner integration framework I design, every vertical extensibility pattern I architect, and every embedded intelligence SDK I build directly accelerates Flywire's partnership revenue. I'd like an RSU package that reflects the revenue impact of platform-enabled partnership expansion."

**Lever 4: Invisible Pay Technical Vision Leadership**
> "David King's Feb 2026 prediction of invisible and adaptive payments is a platform engineering vision. The invisible payment orchestration layer, the adaptive decision engine, the cross-vertical abstraction framework — these are my deliverables. I'm not implementing someone else's platform spec; I'm defining what Flywire's Invisible Pay platform IS. This technical vision leadership — owning the 'what' and the 'how' of the platform — warrants Staff/Principal-level compensation."

**Lever 5: Irreplaceability and Retention Value**
> "The combination of multi-vertical platform engineering, global payment orchestration, adaptive ML system integration, and domain-specific intelligence encoding is a skill set that takes years to develop and is nearly impossible to hire for externally. I want to ensure my compensation reflects not just the market rate for my start date, but the retention value of keeping this rare skill set within Flywire over the full four-year vesting period and beyond."

**Lever 6: Competing Platform Engineering Offers**
> "I have platform engineering offers from Stripe, Google Payments, and [Company X] with total compensation packages ranging from $X to $Y. I'm genuinely most excited about Flywire's Vertical Intelligence thesis — the chance to build a platform that makes payments invisible across multiple verticals is a once-in-career opportunity. But the comp needs to be competitive with these alternatives for me to make the commitment."

#### Extended Negotiation Playbook (SIGNATURE ROLE Exclusive)

**Phase 1 — Pre-Negotiation Intelligence Gathering**:
Before entering negotiations, gather specific data points:
- Flywire's latest NASDAQ: FLYW share price and 52-week range to assess RSU value trajectory
- Recent Flywire earnings call transcripts for David King commentary on Invisible Pay progress and platform investment
- Simovative partnership details and any subsequent partnership announcements that validate vertical expansion
- Stripe, Google, and Adyen recent platform engineering job postings and reported compensation
- Your own competing offers or expressions of interest from these companies

**Phase 2 — Framing the Conversation**:
Open negotiations by framing the role as what it is: the most strategically important technical position at Flywire. Use language like:
- "I see this role as the platform foundation of David King's Invisible Pay vision"
- "The Vertical Intelligence Platform is where Flywire's competitive moat gets built"
- "This is the role that determines whether Flywire becomes the invisible payment intelligence layer for every vertical"

**Phase 3 — Anchoring High with Justification**:
Present your target compensation with specific market evidence:
- Stripe Staff Platform Engineer in NYC: $550K–$650K TC
- Google L6 Payment Infrastructure in NYC: $500K–$600K TC
- "Given that Flywire's multi-vertical platform scope exceeds both of these comparables, I believe a total comp of $635K+ is well-justified for the New York office"

**Phase 4 — Handling Pushback**:
If Flywire pushes back on total comp, negotiate in layers:
- First, maximize RSU: "If base is constrained by band, let's ensure the RSU reflects the platform's strategic importance — $380K+ over four years"
- Second, negotiate sign-on: "A sign-on bonus of $40,000–$60,000 bridges the gap between my current comp and the initial RSU cliff"
- Third, negotiate refresh guarantees: "I'd like written language guaranteeing RSU refresh consideration at each annual review, with a target refresh of 25%+ of the initial grant"
- Fourth, negotiate scope-triggered compensation: "As the platform expands to support new verticals via partnerships like Simovative, I'd like compensation review triggers when platform scope increases materially"

**Phase 5 — Non-Monetary Levers**:
Stack non-monetary levers after cash/equity negotiations:
- Title: Ensure title includes "Platform" and "Intelligence" or "Vertical" — this has long-term career value
- Conference speaking: Negotiate the right to present Flywire's platform architecture at industry conferences (QCon, Platform Engineering Summit, FinTech DevCon)
- Publication rights: Right to publish technical blog posts and papers about Flywire's Vertical Intelligence platform architecture
- Remote flexibility: Platform engineering can be done anywhere — negotiate hybrid or remote arrangements
- Hardware and tooling: Top-tier development hardware, cloud compute access for prototyping, and preferred IDE/tool licenses

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Boston, start at $250,000 base + $360,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $205,000 base + $220,000 RSU/4yr. For New York, start at $270,000 base + $400,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $220,000 base + $240,000 RSU/4yr. For London, start at £165,000 base + £200,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than £128,000 base + £120,000 RSU/4yr. This is the SIGNATURE ROLE — the most strategically important technical hire at Flywire. Always negotiate sign-on bonus ($35,000–$60,000) separately from base and RSU. Always negotiate RSU refresh guarantees in writing. Always benchmark against Stripe Staff/Principal Platform Engineer and Google L6 payment infrastructure compensation. If the offer falls below the accept-at floor, you are being compensated as a feature engineer, not as the architect of Flywire's Invisible Pay platform — walk away or escalate to VP Engineering/CTO for a band exception.

#### SIGNATURE ROLE — Why This Role Commands Maximum Leverage

This section is unique to the SIGNATURE ROLE guide and explains why the Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer carries the strongest negotiation position in the entire Flywire organization:

1. **Single Point of Strategic Dependency**: The Invisible Pay vision depends on the platform. The platform depends on the Vertical Intelligence Platform Engineer. No other role has this direct, single-threaded connection to Flywire's CEO-level strategic priority. When David King talks about invisible and adaptive payments in February 2026, he is describing what your platform does.

2. **Multi-Team Force Multiplier**: Every engineering team at Flywire — education vertical, healthcare vertical, travel vertical, data science, ML/AI, DevOps, security — depends on your platform APIs, SDKs, and infrastructure. Your decisions enable or constrain the productivity of 50+ engineers. This force-multiplier effect is rare and commands Staff/Principal-level compensation.

3. **Partnership Revenue Enablement**: Every Simovative-style partnership is only possible because of the platform you build. Partnership revenue flows through your platform. If the platform cannot onboard new verticals at partnership speed, Flywire's growth strategy stalls. Revenue enablement at this scale is typically compensated at VP-level in sales organizations — your engineering equivalent should match.

4. **Competitive Moat Builder**: The Vertical Intelligence Platform IS Flywire's competitive moat. Horizontal payment processors cannot replicate a platform that encodes years of multi-vertical domain intelligence into platform primitives. You are not just writing code — you are building the artifact that makes Flywire defensible against Stripe, Adyen, and every other payment company. Moat-building is the highest-leverage engineering work and should be compensated accordingly.

5. **Market Scarcity**: The intersection of platform engineering, vertical domain intelligence, global payment orchestration, adaptive ML system integration, and partner ecosystem architecture defines a talent pool that may number in the low hundreds globally. Flywire's recruiter will confirm: this role is one of the hardest to fill in the entire company. Scarcity is your most powerful negotiation lever.
