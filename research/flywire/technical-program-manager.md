### Technical Program Manager — Flywire Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Flywire's Invisible Pay transformation, translating the Feb 2026 David King predictions and Feb 3 Simovative partnership into a technical program management compensation framework spanning Boston, New York, and London markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $145,000–$195,000 | $70,000–$140,000 | $215,000–$335,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $155,000–$210,000 | $80,000–$155,000 | $235,000–$365,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £85,000–£130,000 | £40,000–£80,000 | £125,000–£210,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Technical Program Managers at Flywire are the execution engine of the Invisible Pay transformation. CEO David King's Feb 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments requires coordinating engineering, product, design, data science, compliance, and go-to-market teams across multiple verticals and three continents. The Feb 3 Simovative partnership adds partner coordination to an already complex execution matrix. TPMs at Flywire manage programs of genuine strategic significance — the shift from payment processor to invisible payment intelligence layer is a multi-year, multi-vertical transformation that lives or dies on program execution. TPMs who can orchestrate this level of cross-functional complexity across regulated verticals are rare and command premium compensation.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| TPM (L4-L5) | TPM L3 | Program Manager | Technical Program Manager |
| Senior TPM (L5-L6) | Senior TPM L4 | Senior Program Manager | Senior TPM |

- Google TPMs (L5-L6) earn $300K–$450K TC; use as upper anchor for Flywire Senior TPM negotiations.
- Stripe TPMs carry broad cross-functional scope; Flywire TPMs add multi-vertical and partner ecosystem coordination on top.
- The multi-vertical complexity (education + healthcare + travel regulatory cadences) makes Flywire TPM programs significantly more complex than single-product payment company programs.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: David King's February 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments is a TPM's defining program. Transforming Flywire from a visible payment processor into an invisible payment intelligence layer requires coordinating platform re-architecture, vertical-specific feature development, compliance workstreams, partner integrations, and client rollouts — all simultaneously. TPMs who can hold this complexity and drive execution are the difference between the vision shipping and the vision stalling.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The Simovative partnership adds a new dimension to TPM scope: partner program management. Coordinating technical integrations with vertical platform partners, managing joint delivery timelines, and ensuring quality across partner implementations requires TPM discipline that extends beyond internal team coordination. Each partnership is a new program track under your management.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: Flywire's Vertical Intelligence strategy means TPMs must understand domain-specific delivery cadences — education billing aligns with academic calendars, healthcare implementations must respect clinical workflows, travel integrations follow booking seasons. TPMs who understand these vertical rhythms can sequence delivery optimally, a skill that generic program managers lack.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: TPMs benefit from the Invisible Pay transformation because transformation programs are the highest-impact, highest-visibility TPM work. Leading the Invisible Pay program across verticals gives you organizational influence that translates directly into accelerated career progression and stronger negotiation leverage at review cycles.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Transformation Program Leadership**
> "The Invisible Pay transformation is Flywire's highest-priority strategic program, and I'll be the TPM driving its execution. This is not business-as-usual program management — it's a multi-year platform transformation spanning engineering, product, compliance, and go-to-market. I'd expect compensation that reflects the strategic significance of this program."

**Lever 2: Multi-Vertical Coordination Complexity**
> "Managing programs across education, healthcare, and travel verticals — each with distinct regulatory timelines, client expectations, and delivery cadences — is exponentially more complex than single-product program management. David King's Invisible Pay vision adds cross-vertical coordination on top. My offer should reflect this coordination complexity."

**Lever 3: Partner Ecosystem Program Scope**
> "The Simovative partnership and Flywire's expanding partner ecosystem add partner program management to my scope. Coordinating joint delivery with vertical platform partners requires diplomatic and technical program skills that go beyond internal TPM work. I'd like compensation that reflects this expanded scope."

**Lever 4: Competing TPM Offers**
> "I'm evaluating TPM offers from Google and Stripe where total comp starts at $X. Flywire's Invisible Pay transformation is a more compelling program leadership opportunity, but I need the comp to be competitive."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Boston, start at $190,000 base + $135,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $155,000 base + $80,000 RSU/4yr. For New York, start at $205,000 base + $150,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $165,000 base + $90,000 RSU/4yr. For London, start at £125,000 base + £75,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than £92,000 base + £45,000 RSU/4yr. TPMs should negotiate for program management tool budgets, PMP/certification reimbursement, and explicit scope-expansion triggers tied to compensation reviews.
