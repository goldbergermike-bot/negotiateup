### Staff Software Engineer — Flywire Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Flywire's Invisible Pay transformation, translating the Feb 2026 David King predictions and Feb 3 Simovative partnership into a staff-level engineering compensation framework spanning Boston, New York, and London markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $190,000–$240,000 | $180,000–$320,000 | $370,000–$560,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $200,000–$255,000 | $200,000–$360,000 | $400,000–$615,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £115,000–£155,000 | £100,000–£180,000 | £215,000–£335,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Staff Software Engineers at Flywire are the technical visionaries who translate CEO David King's Invisible Pay thesis into system-wide architecture. At this level, you are not solving problems within a single vertical — you are designing the cross-vertical payment intelligence platform that makes payments invisible across education, healthcare, travel, and the new verticals unlocked by partnerships like Simovative. Your technical decisions have multi-year, multi-million-dollar revenue impact. Staff engineers at Flywire operate at the intersection of deep domain expertise and platform-scale engineering, a combination so rare that competing offers from Stripe, Adyen, or Checkout.com rarely capture the full scope of the role. Your compensation should reflect that you are architecting the invisible payment intelligence layer for a NASDAQ-listed company in hypergrowth mode.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Staff SWE (L6) | L4 / Staff | Principal Engineer | Staff Engineer |
| Staff SWE II (L6+) | L4+ | Distinguished Engineer | Principal Engineer |

- Stripe Staff (L4) total comp in NYC can reach $600K+; use this as your upper anchor when negotiating Flywire Staff offers.
- Adyen Principal Engineers carry similar organizational scope but with more concentrated geographic focus; Flywire Staff roles span three continents.
- Staff engineers at Flywire uniquely own cross-vertical technical strategy — a scope that has no direct parallel at single-product payment companies.
- The rarity of engineers who can operate at Staff level across multiple regulated verticals justifies a 15–25% premium over single-vertical Staff roles.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: David King's February 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments is fundamentally a Staff-level engineering challenge. Making payments disappear into vertical workflows requires rethinking the entire platform architecture — from API design to data models to real-time decision engines. Staff Engineers are the ones who define the technical strategy that makes this vision real. King's predictions signal that Flywire is investing heavily in platform re-architecture, which means Staff-level hiring is critical and your negotiating position is strong.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The Simovative partnership validates Flywire's embedded payment intelligence strategy. For Staff Engineers, this is a force multiplier — every new partnership requires platform-level API design, SDK architecture, and integration framework decisions that only Staff-level engineers can make. The expanding partnership ecosystem directly increases the organizational impact and scope of Staff engineering roles.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: At the Staff level, you are not just building within the Vertical Intelligence platform — you are defining it. Your architecture decisions determine how Flywire encodes domain knowledge (education billing cycles, healthcare adjudication logic, travel settlement patterns) into reusable platform primitives. This is the technical foundation of Flywire's competitive moat.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: Staff Engineers benefit disproportionately from the Invisible Pay transformation because the technical challenges are Staff-level problems by nature. Cross-vertical platform architecture, embedded payment intelligence, adaptive payment routing — these require the judgment, experience, and organizational influence that define the Staff role. Your leverage in negotiations is directly tied to the magnitude of the technical transformation Flywire is undertaking.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Cross-Vertical Platform Architect Premium**
> "The Staff role at Flywire requires designing platform architecture that spans education, healthcare, travel, and emerging verticals like Simovative. This cross-vertical scope is significantly broader than a Staff role at a single-product payment company, and I'd expect compensation to reflect that expanded technical leadership responsibility."

**Lever 2: Invisible Pay Transformation Criticality**
> "David King's Feb 2026 Invisible Pay vision is fundamentally a platform re-architecture challenge — exactly the kind of work that defines Staff engineering. I am one of a very small number of engineers who can lead this transformation across multiple regulated verticals. My offer should reflect the criticality of this hire to Flywire's strategic roadmap."

**Lever 3: FAANG/Stripe Staff-Level Benchmarking**
> "I'm benchmarking against Staff-level offers at Stripe ($550K+ TC), where the technical scope is narrower and single-vertical. Flywire's multi-vertical complexity warrants at minimum a competitive match on total comp, and I believe a premium is justified given the broader architectural ownership."

**Lever 4: Long-Term Equity Alignment**
> "At the Staff level, my architectural decisions will have multi-year revenue impact as the Invisible Pay platform scales. I'd like an RSU package that reflects this long-term value creation — specifically a front-loaded or above-band initial grant with guaranteed refresh at annual review, tied to the platform milestones I'll be driving."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Boston, start at $235,000 base + $300,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $200,000 base + $200,000 RSU/4yr. For New York, start at $250,000 base + $340,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $210,000 base + $220,000 RSU/4yr. For London, start at £150,000 base + £170,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than £120,000 base + £110,000 RSU/4yr. At Staff level, always negotiate sign-on bonus ($25,000–$50,000) and relocation assistance independently from base and RSU.
