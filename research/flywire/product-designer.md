### Product Designer — Flywire Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Flywire's Invisible Pay transformation, translating the Feb 2026 David King predictions and Feb 3 Simovative partnership into a product design compensation framework spanning Boston, New York, and London markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $125,000–$165,000 | $50,000–$110,000 | $175,000–$275,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $135,000–$180,000 | $60,000–$125,000 | $195,000–$305,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £70,000–£105,000 | £30,000–£65,000 | £100,000–£170,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Designers at Flywire face a paradox that is also your greatest negotiation lever: you must design something that disappears. CEO David King's Feb 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments means the payment experience should be so seamless that users never notice it. Designing invisibility is exponentially harder than designing visibility — it requires deep understanding of vertical workflows (education enrollment, healthcare intake, travel booking), cross-cultural UX patterns across 240+ countries, and the ability to make complex multi-currency, multi-regulatory transactions feel effortless. The Feb 3 Simovative partnership adds new embedded design challenges. Designers who can make payments invisible across verticals are extraordinarily rare, and your compensation should reflect the difficulty and strategic importance of this work.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Product Designer (L4) | Product Designer | UX Designer | Product Designer |
| Senior Product Designer (L5) | Senior Product Designer | Senior UX Designer | Senior Designer |

- Stripe Product Designers in NYC earn $250K–$350K TC at senior levels; use as your upper anchor.
- Flywire designers have broader surface area than Adyen (single dashboard product) — you design across student, patient, traveler, and institutional experiences.
- Cross-cultural design expertise (240+ countries) is a unique Flywire differentiator that horizontal payment designers don't need.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: David King's February 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments is fundamentally a design challenge. Making payments invisible means designing experiences where the payment step vanishes into the vertical workflow. For a student, tuition payment should be a natural extension of enrollment. For a patient, billing should resolve without friction. Achieving this requires user research across verticals and cultures, interaction design that reduces cognitive load to zero, and visual design that communicates trust without demanding attention. This is the hardest design brief in payments.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The Simovative partnership brings new embedded payment design challenges. Designers must create payment experiences that integrate seamlessly into partner platforms while maintaining Flywire's trust signals and brand consistency. This embedded design work — making payments invisible within someone else's product — requires a sophisticated understanding of design systems, white-labeling, and cross-platform consistency.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: Flywire's Vertical Intelligence approach means designers must become domain experts. You need to understand the emotional context of a tuition payment (high-stakes, stressful), the complexity of a healthcare bill (confusing, multi-payer), and the time pressure of a travel booking (urgent, cross-currency). This vertical design intelligence is Flywire's UX moat.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: Product Designers benefit from the Invisible Pay transformation because the entire payment UX is being reimagined. This is not iterative design on an established product — it is foundational experience design for a new paradigm. Designers who define "invisible payments" will shape the industry standard.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Invisible Design Complexity**
> "Designing payments that disappear is exponentially harder than designing visible payment flows. The Invisible Pay vision requires deep vertical UX research, cross-cultural design sensitivity across 240+ countries, and interaction patterns that reduce payment friction to zero. This design complexity justifies premium compensation."

**Lever 2: Cross-Vertical Design Breadth**
> "I'll be designing experiences across education, healthcare, and travel verticals — each with distinct user emotions, regulatory constraints, and workflow patterns. This cross-vertical design scope is significantly broader than designing a single payment dashboard, and I'd expect my offer to reflect that."

**Lever 3: Embedded Design for Partnerships**
> "The Simovative partnership and Flywire's embedded strategy mean I'll be designing payment experiences that live inside partner platforms. This requires design system architecture, white-label design thinking, and cross-platform consistency — skills that command a premium in the market."

**Lever 4: Portfolio Impact**
> "The work I'll do defining Flywire's Invisible Pay experience will be portfolio-defining and industry-shaping. I'm excited about that, and I'd like my compensation to match the career-defining nature of this design opportunity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Boston, start at $160,000 base + $105,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $135,000 base + $60,000 RSU/4yr. For New York, start at $175,000 base + $120,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $145,000 base + $70,000 RSU/4yr. For London, start at £100,000 base + £60,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than £78,000 base + £35,000 RSU/4yr. Designers should negotiate design tool budgets, conference attendance (Config, Figma events), and portfolio publication rights as non-monetary levers.
