### Software Engineer — Flywire Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Flywire's Invisible Pay transformation, translating the Feb 2026 David King predictions and Feb 3 Simovative partnership into a software engineering compensation framework spanning Boston, New York, and London markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $120,000–$155,000 | $50,000–$100,000 | $170,000–$255,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $130,000–$165,000 | $55,000–$110,000 | $185,000–$275,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £70,000–£95,000 | £30,000–£60,000 | £100,000–£155,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: As Flywire accelerates its Invisible Pay vision — where payments disappear into the background of education, healthcare, and travel workflows — Software Engineers are the builders who translate that vision into production code. Every API endpoint, every microservice, every integration layer you ship directly advances CEO David King's Feb 2026 prediction that payments will become invisible and adaptive. This is not generic fintech work; you are building vertical-specific payment intelligence that no horizontal processor can replicate. That vertical specificity commands a premium over generic SWE roles at companies like Stripe or Adyen, because Flywire's domain complexity (regulatory, currency, vertical workflow) raises the engineering bar significantly.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| SWE I (L3) | L1/New Grad | Junior Engineer | Associate Engineer |
| SWE II (L4) | L2 | Engineer | Engineer |

- Flywire SWE roles tend to carry broader scope than equivalents at horizontal payment processors due to the multi-vertical complexity (education + healthcare + travel + B2B).
- Stripe and Adyen typically offer 10–20% higher base in pure cash but Flywire's RSU upside on NASDAQ: FLYW provides meaningful equity appreciation potential as the Invisible Pay thesis materializes.
- Use Checkout.com and Adyen London offers as direct comparables for the London office.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: In February 2026, Flywire CEO David King laid out a bold vision: payments should become invisible and adaptive, disappearing entirely into the background of vertical workflows. For education, that means tuition payments that auto-route across currencies and regulations without the student ever seeing the complexity. For healthcare, it means billing that adapts to insurance, out-of-pocket, and cross-border scenarios seamlessly. This is not incremental — it is a fundamental platform re-architecture.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The February 3, 2026 partnership with Simovative signals Flywire's expansion into new verticals with embedded payment intelligence. This partnership validates the "Vertical Intelligence" thesis — Flywire is not just processing payments, it is embedding intelligent payment orchestration directly into vertical software platforms. For Software Engineers, this means building APIs and integration layers that power invisible payments across an expanding set of verticals.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: Flywire's moat is vertical intelligence — deep domain expertise encoded into payment software. As a Software Engineer, you are not writing generic CRUD apps; you are building systems that understand the nuances of international tuition remittance, healthcare billing complexity, and travel payment orchestration. This vertical intelligence is extraordinarily difficult to replicate and makes your skills highly specific and valuable.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: Software Engineers at Flywire benefit from the Invisible Pay transformation because every new vertical, every new Simovative-style partnership, and every invisible payment flow requires net-new engineering work. Demand for your skills inside Flywire is accelerating, not plateauing. Use this demand signal in negotiations.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Vertical Complexity Premium**
> "I want to highlight that Flywire's engineering challenges span multiple regulated verticals — education, healthcare, travel — each with unique compliance, currency, and workflow requirements. This isn't single-vertical fintech; it's multi-vertical payment intelligence, and I'd expect compensation to reflect that engineering complexity."

**Lever 2: Invisible Pay Builder Scarcity**
> "With CEO David King's Feb 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments and the Simovative partnership expanding into new verticals, Flywire needs engineers who can build embedded payment intelligence at scale. Engineers with this specific vertical payments expertise are scarce, and I'd like my offer to reflect the premium the market places on this skill set."

**Lever 3: Competing Horizontal Offers**
> "I have competing interest from horizontal payment processors where base compensation starts higher, but I'm drawn to Flywire's vertical intelligence thesis. I'd like to close the base gap so I can commit fully to the Invisible Pay mission without leaving significant cash on the table."

**Lever 4: RSU Upside Alignment**
> "I'm excited about Flywire's NASDAQ-listed equity and the growth thesis around Invisible Pay. To fully align my compensation with that upside, I'd like to discuss a stronger initial RSU grant — my contributions to the platform will directly drive the revenue expansion that supports FLYW share price appreciation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Boston, start at $150,000 base + $90,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $130,000 base + $60,000 RSU/4yr. For New York, start at $160,000 base + $100,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $140,000 base + $70,000 RSU/4yr. For London, start at £92,000 base + £55,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than £78,000 base + £38,000 RSU/4yr. Always negotiate RSU refresh language into your offer letter — Flywire's Invisible Pay expansion will generate annual refresh grant opportunities.
