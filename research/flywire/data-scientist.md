### Data Scientist — Flywire Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Flywire's Invisible Pay transformation, translating the Feb 2026 David King predictions and Feb 3 Simovative partnership into a data science compensation framework spanning Boston, New York, and London markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $140,000–$185,000 | $70,000–$150,000 | $210,000–$335,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $150,000–$200,000 | $80,000–$170,000 | $230,000–$370,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £80,000–£115,000 | £40,000–£80,000 | £120,000–£195,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Scientists at Flywire are the intelligence layer behind the Invisible Pay vision. CEO David King's Feb 2026 prediction of adaptive payments — payments that automatically adjust to context, currency, regulation, and user behavior — is a data science mandate. You build the models that determine optimal payment routing, predict conversion rates across 240+ countries, detect fraud in multi-vertical transaction flows, and quantify the business impact of making payments invisible. The Feb 3 Simovative partnership introduces new data domains and modeling challenges. Data scientists who understand vertical payment data — with its unique distributions, regulatory constraints, and domain-specific features — are far rarer than general-purpose data scientists, and your compensation should reflect that specialization.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Data Scientist (L4) | Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Analyst/Scientist |
| Senior Data Scientist (L5) | Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist |

- Stripe Data Scientists typically earn 15–20% more in base; Flywire's vertical data complexity and RSU upside can close the gap.
- Adyen's data science team is smaller and more analytics-focused; Flywire DS roles carry broader modeling scope.
- Flywire's multi-vertical data (education + healthcare + travel) creates uniquely rich and complex datasets that general fintech companies lack.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: David King's February 2026 vision explicitly calls for adaptive payments — payments that automatically adjust based on context. "Adaptive" is a data science word. The models that power adaptive payment routing, dynamic currency optimization, contextual fraud detection, and personalized payment experiences are built by data scientists. King's vision puts data science at the center of Flywire's strategic transformation.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The Simovative partnership introduces new vertical data streams and modeling challenges. Data Scientists must build models that generalize across verticals (education, healthcare, travel, and now Simovative's domains) while capturing vertical-specific patterns. This multi-domain modeling challenge is technically demanding and organizationally impactful.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: Flywire's Vertical Intelligence is, at its core, a data intelligence play. The company's ability to make payments invisible depends on models trained on vertical-specific data — tuition payment timing patterns, healthcare billing cycles, travel booking seasonality. Data Scientists who build these vertical-specific models are creating the algorithmic foundation of Flywire's competitive moat.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: Data Scientists benefit from the Invisible Pay transformation because "adaptive" payments require more sophisticated models, more data, and more data science investment. As Flywire's payment intelligence becomes more adaptive, the importance and scope of data science roles grows proportionally — and so does your negotiation leverage.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Adaptive Payments = Data Science Mandate**
> "David King's Feb 2026 vision of adaptive payments is fundamentally a data science challenge. The models that power adaptive routing, dynamic optimization, and contextual intelligence are my core deliverables. I'd like compensation that reflects the centrality of data science to Flywire's strategic vision."

**Lever 2: Multi-Vertical Data Complexity**
> "Flywire's data spans education, healthcare, travel, and expanding verticals — each with distinct distributions, regulatory constraints, and domain-specific features. Building models that work across these verticals requires rare multi-domain expertise, and I'd expect compensation to reflect that complexity."

**Lever 3: Competing Data Science Offers**
> "I'm evaluating data science offers from Stripe and other fintech companies where total comp starts at $X. Flywire's vertical data is uniquely interesting to me, but I need the financial package to be competitive."

**Lever 4: Model Impact on Revenue**
> "My models will directly impact payment conversion rates, fraud loss reduction, and optimal currency routing — each with quantifiable revenue impact. I'd like to discuss RSU grants that align my compensation with the revenue impact my work will generate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Boston, start at $180,000 base + $140,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $150,000 base + $80,000 RSU/4yr. For New York, start at $195,000 base + $160,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $160,000 base + $95,000 RSU/4yr. For London, start at £110,000 base + £75,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than £85,000 base + £45,000 RSU/4yr. Data scientists should negotiate for cloud compute budget, conference attendance (NeurIPS, ICML), and publication rights as non-monetary levers.
