### Data Engineer — Flywire Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Flywire's Invisible Pay transformation, translating the Feb 2026 David King predictions and Feb 3 Simovative partnership into a data engineering compensation framework spanning Boston, New York, and London markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $140,000–$190,000 | $60,000–$130,000 | $200,000–$320,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $150,000–$205,000 | $70,000–$145,000 | $220,000–$350,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £80,000–£120,000 | £35,000–£75,000 | £115,000–£195,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Engineers at Flywire build the data infrastructure that makes the Invisible Pay vision possible. CEO David King's Feb 2026 prediction of adaptive payments depends on real-time data pipelines that transform raw cross-border payment flows from 240+ countries into structured, actionable intelligence. Without your pipelines, feature stores, and data platforms, the adaptive payment routing, dynamic currency optimization, and vertical-specific intelligence models cannot function. The Feb 3 Simovative partnership introduces new data integration requirements across partner platforms. Data Engineers who can build pipelines spanning multiple regulated verticals — each with distinct data schemas, quality requirements, and latency demands — are the critical infrastructure layer of Flywire's Vertical Intelligence moat.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Data Engineer (L4) | Data Engineer L2 | Data Engineer | Data Engineer |
| Senior Data Engineer (L5) | Senior Data Engineer L3 | Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer |

- Stripe Data Engineers earn competitive base with strong RSU; Flywire's multi-vertical data complexity (education + healthcare + travel data schemas) justifies parity.
- Flywire Data Engineers handle cross-border data normalization across 240+ countries — a data engineering challenge that single-geography payment companies don't face.
- Google and Meta data engineering comp ($280K–$400K TC at senior levels) are appropriate upper anchors for senior-level negotiations.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: David King's February 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments is a data engineering mandate. Adaptive payments require real-time data pipelines that feed payment context (currency, regulation, vertical workflow stage, user behavior) into decision engines that route and optimize payments invisibly. The shift from batch-oriented payment processing to real-time adaptive intelligence is fundamentally a data infrastructure re-architecture — and Data Engineers are the ones who build it.

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The Simovative partnership introduces new data sources, new data schemas, and new integration pipelines. Data Engineers must build ETL/ELT pipelines that ingest partner data, normalize it to Flywire's data models, and serve it to downstream systems. Each new partnership is a new data integration challenge that extends your pipeline architecture.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: Flywire's Vertical Intelligence depends on structured, high-quality data from each vertical domain. Data Engineers must understand the semantics of education payment data (tuition cycles, enrollment status, financial aid), healthcare billing data (insurance claims, patient responsibility, adjudication), and travel transaction data (booking flows, multi-currency settlement, refund patterns). This vertical data expertise is the foundation of every model, every report, and every adaptive payment decision.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: Data Engineers benefit from the Invisible Pay transformation because the shift to adaptive payments dramatically increases data infrastructure requirements. More real-time pipelines, more feature stores, more streaming architecture, more data quality monitoring — every aspect of the Invisible Pay platform needs more data engineering. Your organizational importance and negotiation leverage grow with every new vertical and partnership.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Adaptive Payments Data Infrastructure**
> "David King's Feb 2026 vision of adaptive payments requires real-time data pipelines that feed payment context into decision engines. I'm building the data infrastructure that makes adaptive payments possible. Without reliable, low-latency data pipelines, the Invisible Pay vision cannot materialize. I'd like compensation that reflects the foundational nature of this infrastructure work."

**Lever 2: Multi-Vertical Data Complexity**
> "Flywire's data spans education, healthcare, travel, and B2B verticals — each with distinct schemas, quality requirements, and regulatory constraints — across 240+ countries and currencies. Building data pipelines that normalize and serve this multi-vertical, multi-currency data is an order of magnitude more complex than single-vertical data engineering. My offer should reflect that complexity."

**Lever 3: Partnership Data Integration Scope**
> "The Simovative partnership and Flywire's expanding partner ecosystem mean I'll be building data integration pipelines for an expanding set of vertical platform partners. This partner data integration work adds significant scope beyond internal data engineering. I'd like compensation that reflects this expanded mandate."

**Lever 4: Competing Data Engineering Offers**
> "I'm evaluating data engineering offers from Stripe and cloud data companies where total comp starts at $X. Flywire's multi-vertical data challenges are uniquely compelling, but the comp needs to be competitive for me to make the commitment."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: For Boston, start at $185,000 base + $125,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $150,000 base + $70,000 RSU/4yr. For New York, start at $200,000 base + $140,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than $160,000 base + $80,000 RSU/4yr. For London, start at £115,000 base + £70,000 RSU/4yr; accept no lower than £88,000 base + £40,000 RSU/4yr. Data engineers should negotiate for cloud compute and data tool budgets, conference attendance (Data Council, dbt Coalesce), and data certification reimbursement as non-monetary levers.
