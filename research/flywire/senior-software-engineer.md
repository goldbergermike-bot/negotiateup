#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 Boston (USD) | $155,000–$195,000 | $100,000–$180,000 | $255,000–$375,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $165,000–$210,000 | $110,000–$200,000 | $275,000–$410,000 |
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £90,000–£125,000 | £55,000–£100,000 | £145,000–£225,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Senior Software Engineers at Flywire are the technical backbone of the Invisible Pay platform. You own the architecture decisions, code quality standards, and cross-vertical integration patterns that make payments disappear into education, healthcare, and travel workflows. CEO David King's Feb 2026 vision of invisible and adaptive payments depends on senior engineers who can navigate multi-currency orchestration, regulatory compliance across jurisdictions, and domain-specific API design. The Feb 3 Simovative partnership further expands the surface area of engineering challenges. Your seniority means you are not just writing code — you are defining the technical patterns that scale Flywire's Vertical Intelligence moat. This architectural ownership warrants compensation that competes with Staff-level offers at horizontal processors like Stripe.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Flywire Level | Equivalent at Stripe | Equivalent at Adyen | Equivalent at Checkout.com |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Senior SWE (L5) | L3 / Senior | Senior Engineer | Senior Engineer |
| Senior SWE II (L5+) | L3+ | Senior Engineer II | Lead Engineer |

- Flywire Senior SWEs typically own end-to-end features across verticals, which maps to broader scope than a single-product Senior at Stripe.
- Adyen Senior Engineers in Amsterdam often earn less in base but receive competitive RSU; use London Adyen comps for direct comparison.
- Checkout.com Senior roles in London are the closest market comparable for Flywire London offers.
- The multi-vertical complexity at Flywire (education regulatory + healthcare HIPAA + travel PCI) justifies a 10–15% complexity premium over single-vertical senior roles.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ Flywire Invisible Pay & Vertical Intelligence Lever

**Feb 2026 David King Predictions — Invisible & Adaptive Payments**: CEO David King's February 2026 public statements outlined a transformative vision: payments should become invisible and adaptive. Rather than being a visible step in a transaction, payment should vanish into the workflow — a student enrolls and payment happens; a patient receives care and billing resolves itself; a traveler books and cross-border settlement occurs transparently. For Senior Engineers, this means re-thinking system architecture from "payment flow" to "invisible intelligence layer."

**Feb 3, 2026 Simovative Partnership**: The Simovative partnership announced February 3, 2026 represents Flywire's strategy of embedding payment intelligence into third-party vertical platforms. Senior Engineers are critical to this strategy — you design the APIs, SDKs, and integration patterns that allow Flywire's payment intelligence to embed seamlessly into partner platforms. Each new partnership multiplies the engineering surface area and your organizational impact.

**Vertical Intelligence Positioning**: Flywire is not a generic payment processor; it is a Vertical Intelligence platform. The company encodes deep domain knowledge — tuition billing cycles, healthcare insurance adjudication, travel agency settlement — into software. Senior Engineers are the ones who translate this domain knowledge into scalable, maintainable systems. This vertical expertise creates a significant moat and makes experienced Flywire Senior Engineers exceptionally hard to replace.

**Role-Specific Benefit**: As a Senior Software Engineer, the Invisible Pay transformation directly increases your leverage. Every new vertical Flywire enters (via partnerships like Simovative) requires senior engineering leadership to define architecture, mentor junior engineers, and ensure production reliability. Your scarcity value increases as the platform expands.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Architectural Ownership Premium**
> "At the senior level, I'll be making architecture decisions that directly shape Flywire's Invisible Pay platform across multiple verticals. The technical leadership required to design systems spanning education, healthcare, and travel payments — each with distinct regulatory and workflow requirements — warrants compensation that reflects architectural ownership, not just individual contribution."

**Lever 2: Vertical Intelligence Scarcity**
> "Engineers with deep expertise in vertical payment orchestration — particularly across the education-healthcare-travel trifecta — are extraordinarily rare. David King's Feb 2026 Invisible Pay vision and the Simovative expansion mean Flywire's demand for this expertise is accelerating. I'd like my offer to reflect that scarcity."

**Lever 3: Competing Offers from Horizontal Processors**
> "I'm evaluating offers from Stripe and Adyen where Senior Engineer total comp starts at $X. While I'm genuinely excited about Flywire's Vertical Intelligence thesis, I need the offer to be competitive with these alternatives to make the commitment."

**Lever 4: Equity Growth Conviction**
> "I believe strongly in the FLYW equity story — the Invisible Pay thesis and vertical expansion through partnerships like Simovative represent a significant growth catalyst. I'd like to align my compensation with that conviction through a larger RSU grant, reflecting my commitment to driving the platform forward over the full four-year vesting period."
