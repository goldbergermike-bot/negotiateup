#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Veeva Systems

Security Engineers at Veeva operate in one of the highest-stakes security environments in enterprise software. Pharmaceutical companies entrust Veeva with clinical trial data, patient health information, and proprietary drug development data. A security breach at Veeva would not only trigger HIPAA violations and FDA enforcement actions — it would jeopardize clinical trials and potentially impact patient safety.

The regulatory overlay — HIPAA, FDA 21 CFR Part 11, SOC 2 Type II, and international data protection regulations — means security engineering at Veeva goes far beyond standard application security. You must implement security controls that satisfy regulatory auditors, pharmaceutical compliance teams, and security review boards simultaneously.

#### Veeva Systems Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Veeva Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Security Engineer | SecEng (IC3-IC4) | 2–5 years |
| Senior Security Engineer | Senior SecEng (IC5) | 5–8 years |
| Staff Security Engineer | Staff SecEng (IC6) | 8–12 years |
| Principal Security Architect | Principal SecArch (IC7) | 12+ years |

### Veeva Vault Platform & Life Sciences Cloud Premium

Security is existential for the Vault platform. Frame your negotiation: "I protect the pharmaceutical data that Veeva's $35B market cap depends on. A single security incident could trigger FDA enforcement, customer loss, and regulatory scrutiny. My security engineering expertise directly protects Veeva's market position and customer trust."

#### Global Lever 1: Vault Platform Migration

Security architecture for the new platform: "I will design the security architecture for the Vault platform — identity management, encryption, access controls, and audit logging that meet pharmaceutical regulatory requirements. Security is the foundation of the platform migration."

#### Global Lever 2: Regulatory Compliance Engineering

Security for regulatory compliance: "I implement security controls that satisfy FDA 21 CFR Part 11, HIPAA, and SOC 2 requirements simultaneously. My security work enables Veeva to pass pharmaceutical customer security reviews and regulatory audits."

#### Global Lever 3: Clinical & Commercial Cloud Expansion

Security across product portfolio: "I build security controls that serve every product — from clinical trial data protection to commercial data privacy. Cross-product security architecture is my specialty."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Cloud & AI in Life Sciences

AI security: "I address the emerging security challenges of AI in life sciences — from protecting training data to preventing model extraction to ensuring AI outputs don't expose patient information. AI security in regulated healthcare is a new frontier."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $205,000 base with $175,000 in RSUs over 4 years (~761 shares at ~$230/share). Your accept-at floor should be $275,000 total comp. Cite the pharmaceutical data protection premium, the Vault security architecture scope, and the regulatory compliance overlay. For East Coast, open at $190,000 base; for Europe, open at EUR 85,000 base.
