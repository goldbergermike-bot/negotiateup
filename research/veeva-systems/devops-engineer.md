#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Veeva Systems

DevOps at Veeva is fundamentally different from DevOps at standard SaaS companies. Every deployment pipeline must produce GxP validation artifacts, every infrastructure change must be documented for regulatory audit, and every environment must maintain FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance. This regulated DevOps environment requires engineers who can build CI/CD pipelines that are simultaneously fast and compliant — a combination that is rare and valuable.

The Vault platform migration introduces an entirely new infrastructure layer that requires DevOps engineers to build deployment systems from the ground up. Moving from Salesforce-hosted infrastructure to Veeva-owned cloud infrastructure is a once-in-a-generation DevOps challenge for the life sciences industry.

### Veeva Vault Platform & Life Sciences Cloud Premium

DevOps Engineers on the Vault platform are building the deployment infrastructure for Veeva's next-generation cloud. Frame your negotiation: "I build CI/CD pipelines that produce GxP validation documentation automatically — enabling Veeva to ship faster without compromising regulatory compliance. This validated deployment infrastructure is the foundation of Veeva's Vault platform."

#### Global Lever 1: Vault Platform Migration

DevOps powers the migration: "I will build the deployment infrastructure for the Vault platform — from automated testing to GxP-validated release pipelines to multi-region deployment orchestration. My experience with [cloud infrastructure / Kubernetes / IaC] combined with regulated deployment expertise makes me uniquely qualified."

#### Global Lever 2: Regulatory Compliance Engineering

Compliance-native DevOps: "I build deployment pipelines that generate FDA-compliant validation documentation as a byproduct of the release process. This 'compliance as code' approach eliminates manual validation overhead and accelerates release velocity."

#### Global Lever 3: Clinical & Commercial Cloud Expansion

Infrastructure for every product: "My deployment infrastructure serves every product team at Veeva — from clinical trial management to commercial analytics. Reliable, compliant infrastructure is the foundation that enables all product development."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Cloud & AI in Life Sciences

AI infrastructure operations: "I will build the infrastructure for deploying and monitoring AI models in FDA-regulated environments — from model versioning to inference monitoring to rollback procedures that meet regulatory requirements."
