### Software Engineer — Veeva Systems Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Veeva Systems is the dominant life sciences cloud platform with a $35B market cap, and every Software Engineer directly accelerates the digital transformation of pharmaceutical and biotech companies worldwide.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Bay Area / Pleasanton (USD) | Boston / East Coast (USD) | Europe (EUR/GBP) |
|-------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $150,000–$200,000 | $140,000–$185,000 | €55,000–€80,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $200,000–$260,000 | $185,000–$240,000 | €80,000–€110,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $260,000–$340,000 | $240,000–$310,000 | €110,000–€150,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest, $80K-$200K), and 10% performance bonus. Veeva (NYSE: VEEV) trades at ~$230/share, making RSU grants a significant component. Veeva's premium healthcare-tech positioning drives compensation above standard enterprise SaaS.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Veeva Systems

Veeva Systems occupies a unique position in enterprise software: it is the undisputed market leader in life sciences cloud applications, serving 19 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies globally. This monopoly-like market position creates exceptional stability and pricing power, which translates directly into premium compensation for engineers who build and maintain the platform.

Veeva's transition from Salesforce infrastructure to its own Veeva Vault platform represents a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar architectural migration. Software Engineers working on Vault are building the next-generation cloud platform that will serve the entire life sciences industry for decades. This is not incremental feature work — it is foundational platform engineering with massive long-term impact.

The life sciences vertical demands regulatory compliance (FDA 21 CFR Part 11, GxP validation, HIPAA), data integrity, and audit trail capabilities that standard SaaS platforms cannot provide. Software Engineers at Veeva must understand and implement these requirements, making their skills highly specialized and difficult to replace. This specialization commands a premium.

#### Veeva Systems Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Veeva Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Software Engineer | SWE I (IC3) | 1–3 years |
| Software Engineer II | SWE II (IC4) | 3–5 years |
| Senior Software Engineer | Senior SWE (IC5) | 5–8 years |
| Staff Software Engineer | Staff SWE (IC6) | 8–12 years |
| Principal Software Engineer | Principal SWE (IC7) | 12+ years |

### Veeva Vault Platform & Life Sciences Cloud Premium

Veeva's $35B market cap reflects the market's recognition that life sciences cloud is a durable, high-margin business with massive switching costs. The Vault platform — Veeva's proprietary cloud infrastructure replacing its legacy Salesforce dependency — is the most strategically important engineering initiative in the company's history. Software Engineers building Vault are creating the foundation for Veeva's next decade of growth.

The life sciences regulatory environment creates a unique premium for Veeva engineers. Every feature must be validated, every data change must be auditable, and every deployment must meet FDA and EMA standards. Engineers who understand GxP validation and can build compliant systems are rare and command premium compensation.

Use this framing: "Veeva's Vault platform migration is the most important engineering initiative in the company's history. My experience in [cloud platform development / regulatory compliance / enterprise SaaS] positions me to accelerate this transition. Given Veeva's $35B market cap and healthcare-tech premium, I expect compensation that reflects the specialized nature of this work."

#### Global Lever 1: Vault Platform Migration

Veeva's migration from Salesforce to its own Vault platform is a multi-year, company-defining initiative. Software Engineers contributing to Vault are building a proprietary cloud platform from the ground up — including multi-tenant architecture, data storage, API layers, and UI frameworks. Frame your value: "I bring experience in [cloud platform engineering / multi-tenant architecture / API design] that directly applies to Veeva's Vault platform migration. This is foundational work that will define Veeva's competitive position for the next decade."

#### Global Lever 2: Regulatory Compliance Engineering

Life sciences software must meet stringent regulatory requirements including FDA 21 CFR Part 11, GxP validation, and HIPAA. Software Engineers who can build compliant systems — with audit trails, electronic signatures, data integrity controls, and validation documentation — bring specialized value: "My experience with [regulatory compliance / audit trail systems / validated environments] is directly applicable to Veeva's life sciences platform requirements. This specialization commands a premium that standard SaaS roles don't require."

#### Global Lever 3: Clinical & Commercial Cloud Expansion

Veeva's product portfolio spans clinical operations (Vault CDMS, Vault eTMF), regulatory affairs (Vault RIM), quality management (Vault QMS), and commercial cloud (Veeva CRM, Veeva Align). Each product area represents a multi-billion-dollar market opportunity. Frame your contribution: "Veeva's clinical and commercial cloud products serve the most demanding enterprise customers in the world. My skills in [distributed systems / data engineering / full-stack development] will accelerate product development across these high-value verticals."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Cloud & AI in Life Sciences

Veeva's Data Cloud products (Compass, Andi, Link) provide pharmaceutical companies with commercial data intelligence. The integration of AI into life sciences workflows — from drug discovery to commercial operations — represents Veeva's next growth frontier: "Veeva's Data Cloud and AI initiatives are the next growth vector. My experience with [data infrastructure / ML systems / analytics platforms] positions me to contribute to this strategic expansion. The combination of AI expertise and life sciences domain knowledge is exceptionally rare."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $190,000 base with $160,000 in RSUs over 4 years (~696 shares at ~$230/share). Your accept-at floor should be $250,000 total comp. Cite Veeva's $35B market cap, the Vault platform migration priority, and the healthcare-tech premium that makes Veeva compensation competitive with top-tier enterprise SaaS companies. For East Coast roles, open at $175,000 base with equivalent RSU grants. For European roles, open at EUR 80,000 base with proportional equity.
