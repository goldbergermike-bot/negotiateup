#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Veeva Systems

TPMs at Veeva manage programs with unique complexity: every engineering initiative must account for FDA regulatory requirements, pharmaceutical customer validation cycles, and multi-product dependencies. A TPM who can coordinate a Vault platform migration workstream while managing regulatory compliance milestones and customer communication is extraordinarily valuable.

The Vault platform migration is a multi-year, company-wide program that requires TPM coordination across every engineering team. TPMs who can manage this scope — balancing technical execution with regulatory compliance — are critical to Veeva's most important strategic initiative.

#### Veeva Systems Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Veeva Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Technical Program Manager | TPM (IC4) | 4–7 years |
| Senior TPM | Senior TPM (IC5) | 7–10 years |
| Principal TPM | Principal TPM (IC6) | 10–14 years |
| Director, Technical Programs | Director TPM (M3) | 14+ years |

### Veeva Vault Platform & Life Sciences Cloud Premium

TPMs on the Vault program coordinate the most consequential engineering initiative in Veeva's history: "I will coordinate the Vault platform migration across multiple engineering teams, regulatory compliance milestones, and customer validation cycles. My ability to manage this complexity directly impacts the migration timeline and Veeva's strategic execution."

#### Global Lever 1: Vault Platform Migration

Program management for the migration: "I will own the program plan for the Vault migration — tracking dependencies across engineering teams, managing regulatory compliance gates, and coordinating customer communication. This is the most complex program at Veeva."

#### Global Lever 2: Regulatory Compliance Engineering

Compliance program management: "I manage programs that include FDA validation milestones, GxP compliance gates, and regulatory audit preparation. My experience with regulated program management ensures that compliance is built into the program plan, not bolted on."

#### Global Lever 3: Clinical & Commercial Cloud Expansion

Cross-product program coordination: "I coordinate programs that span clinical and commercial cloud products — managing dependencies between Vault Clinical, Vault Quality, and Commercial Cloud. My cross-product program expertise enables Veeva to deliver integrated solutions."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Cloud & AI in Life Sciences

AI program management: "I will manage the program plan for AI integration across Veeva's products — coordinating ML engineering, regulatory validation, and product delivery. AI programs in regulated environments require specialized program management."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $200,000 base with $170,000 in RSUs over 4 years (~739 shares at ~$230/share). Your accept-at floor should be $265,000 total comp. Cite the Vault migration program complexity, the regulatory program management premium, and the cross-product coordination scope. For East Coast, open at $185,000 base; for Europe, open at EUR 82,000 base.
