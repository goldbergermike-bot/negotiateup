#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Veeva Systems

Data Scientists at Veeva work with pharmaceutical data that is uniquely valuable and uniquely constrained. Clinical trial data, regulatory submission patterns, prescriber behavior, and commercial sales intelligence form one of the most comprehensive life sciences datasets in the world. The ability to derive insights from this data — while respecting HIPAA, GxP, and pharmaceutical privacy requirements — commands a premium.

Veeva's Data Cloud products (Compass, Andi, Link) are powered by data science. The analytical models that drive prescriber targeting, commercial intelligence, and patient engagement represent direct revenue for Veeva's pharmaceutical customers. Data Scientists who can build these models at Veeva's scale directly impact customer retention and expansion.

### Veeva Vault Platform & Life Sciences Cloud Premium

Data Scientists working on Veeva's platform have access to pharmaceutical data at a scale no competitor can match. Frame your negotiation: "Veeva's position as the dominant life sciences cloud gives me access to the richest pharmaceutical dataset in the industry. My ability to derive actionable insights from this data — while maintaining regulatory compliance — directly drives customer value and Veeva's competitive moat."

#### Global Lever 1: Vault Platform Migration

Data Scientists optimize migration decisions: "I apply statistical methods to prioritize the Vault migration — identifying which customer segments, data patterns, and feature dependencies should drive the migration sequence. My analysis reduces migration risk and accelerates timeline."

#### Global Lever 2: Regulatory Compliance Engineering

Data science for compliance: "I build anomaly detection models that identify potential compliance violations before they occur — from data integrity issues to audit trail gaps. Proactive compliance monitoring through data science is a competitive differentiator."

#### Global Lever 3: Clinical & Commercial Cloud Expansion

Data science drives product value: "I build the analytical models that power Veeva's Data Cloud products — prescriber targeting, commercial intelligence, and patient engagement analytics. These models directly impact the ROI that pharmaceutical customers achieve with Veeva's platform."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Cloud & AI in Life Sciences

Data Scientists lead AI integration: "I develop ML models for pharmaceutical use cases — drug interaction prediction, clinical trial optimization, and regulatory submission analysis. My work at the intersection of data science and life sciences regulation positions me to lead Veeva's AI-driven product evolution."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $200,000 base with $170,000 in RSUs over 4 years (~739 shares at ~$230/share). Your accept-at floor should be $270,000 total comp. Cite the pharmaceutical data specialization premium, Data Cloud revenue impact, and the scarcity of data scientists with life sciences domain expertise. For East Coast, open at $185,000 base; for Europe, open at EUR 85,000 base.
