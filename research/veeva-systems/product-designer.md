Product Designers at Veeva face a unique challenge: designing intuitive, modern user experiences for workflows that are constrained by pharmaceutical regulations, FDA compliance requirements, and established clinical processes. The users — clinical researchers, regulatory affairs professionals, and pharmaceutical sales teams — have highly specialized needs and low tolerance for design friction in mission-critical workflows.

Veeva's Vault platform migration is also a UX transformation. Moving from Salesforce-based interfaces to a modern, Veeva-native design system requires designers who can reimagine complex pharmaceutical workflows while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements for electronic records and signatures.
