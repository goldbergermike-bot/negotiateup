#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Veeva Systems

Staff Software Engineers at Veeva define the technical direction of the Vault platform — the proprietary cloud infrastructure that is replacing Veeva's Salesforce dependency and will serve as the foundation for every life sciences cloud product for the next two decades. At Staff level, you are making architectural decisions that impact every customer, every product line, and every compliance requirement across the platform.

Veeva's $35B market cap is built on its monopoly position in life sciences cloud. Staff engineers are the technical leaders who protect and extend this position through superior architecture. The cost of architectural mistakes at this level — measured in regulatory risk, customer churn, and engineering rework — makes Staff compensation a small fraction of the value at stake.

The healthcare-tech premium at Staff level is substantial. Life sciences regulatory expertise combined with platform architecture skills is one of the rarest skill combinations in enterprise software. Competing offers from Salesforce Health Cloud, Oracle Health Sciences, or Medidata will not match the combination of domain ownership and compensation that Veeva offers.

#### Veeva Systems Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Veeva Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Staff Software Engineer | Staff SWE (IC6) | 8–12 years |
| Senior Staff Software Engineer | Senior Staff (IC6+) | 10–14 years |
| Principal Software Engineer | Principal (IC7) | 12+ years |

### Veeva Vault Platform & Life Sciences Cloud Premium

At Staff level, you are the architect of Vault's future. The platform migration from Salesforce is not just a replatforming exercise — it is a complete reimagining of how life sciences cloud applications should be built. Multi-tenant data isolation, regulatory compliance by design, zero-downtime deployment for clinical trial systems, and petabyte-scale document management are all within your architectural purview.

Frame your negotiation: "As a Staff engineer, I will set the architectural direction for the Vault platform. My decisions will determine the scalability, compliance posture, and competitive differentiation of Veeva's entire product portfolio. This level of architectural responsibility, combined with the life sciences regulatory premium, places this role at the top of enterprise SaaS compensation bands."

#### Global Lever 1: Vault Platform Migration

Staff engineers drive the Vault migration at the architectural level, making decisions that affect multi-year timelines and billions in revenue: "I will own the architecture of [core Vault subsystem]. This is a once-in-a-decade platform transformation that will define Veeva's competitive position. My architectural expertise in [distributed systems / cloud platform design / data migration] is exactly what this initiative requires."

#### Global Lever 2: Regulatory Compliance Engineering

At Staff level, you define the compliance architecture patterns that all engineers follow: "I will establish the architectural patterns that ensure every Vault component meets FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and GxP requirements by design. This compliance-first architecture is Veeva's competitive moat, and I am the engineer who defines and maintains it."

#### Global Lever 3: Clinical & Commercial Cloud Expansion

Staff engineers drive cross-product platform capabilities that serve all clinical and commercial products: "My work on [platform APIs / shared services / data layer] enables every product team at Veeva to build faster and more reliably. This leverage effect means my architectural decisions impact hundreds of millions in product revenue."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Cloud & AI in Life Sciences

Staff engineers set the technical direction for AI integration: "I will architect the foundation for AI capabilities across Veeva's platform — from intelligent document processing in Vault to predictive analytics in Data Cloud. This requires combining platform architecture expertise with AI/ML infrastructure knowledge, a rare combination in life sciences technology."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $250,000 base with $300,000 in RSUs over 4 years (~1,300 shares at ~$230/share). Your accept-at floor should be $380,000 total comp. Cite your architectural authority over the Vault platform, the regulatory compliance premium, and competing offers from Salesforce Health Cloud or Oracle Health Sciences. For East Coast, open at $235,000 base; for Europe, open at EUR 145,000 base with proportional equity. The RSU component is the primary lever — push for larger grants.
