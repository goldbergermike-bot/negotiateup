#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Veeva Systems

Product Managers at Veeva operate at the intersection of technology, regulatory compliance, and pharmaceutical business operations. Unlike PMs at general-purpose SaaS companies, Veeva PMs must deeply understand FDA submission workflows, clinical trial management, GxP validation, and the commercial operations of pharmaceutical companies. This domain expertise takes years to develop and is extremely difficult to recruit for.

Veeva's product portfolio spans clinical, regulatory, quality, and commercial cloud applications — each serving a multi-billion-dollar market opportunity. PMs who can navigate these complex domains while driving product strategy command a significant premium over standard enterprise SaaS PM roles.

### Veeva Vault Platform & Life Sciences Cloud Premium

PMs on the Vault platform define the product strategy for Veeva's most important initiative. Frame your negotiation: "I will own the product roadmap for [Vault CDMS / Vault RIM / Vault QMS / Commercial Cloud], working directly with pharmaceutical customers to translate regulatory requirements into product features. My domain expertise in [clinical operations / regulatory affairs / quality management] is directly applicable and extremely rare in product management."

#### Global Lever 1: Vault Platform Migration

PMs prioritize and sequence the Vault migration: "I will define the migration roadmap that balances customer impact, regulatory compliance, and engineering capacity. My experience managing complex product transitions in regulated industries makes me uniquely qualified."

#### Global Lever 2: Regulatory Compliance Engineering

PMs translate regulatory requirements into product specs: "I understand FDA 21 CFR Part 11, GxP validation, and ICH guidelines at a level that enables me to write product requirements that engineering can implement without regulatory rework. This domain expertise saves months of development time."

#### Global Lever 3: Clinical & Commercial Cloud Expansion

PMs drive expansion into new life sciences verticals: "I will own the product strategy for [specific clinical/commercial area], identifying expansion opportunities and driving feature development that increases account penetration in Veeva's largest pharmaceutical customers."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Cloud & AI in Life Sciences

PMs define AI product strategy: "AI in life sciences is heavily regulated and requires PMs who understand both the technology and the regulatory constraints. My experience at the intersection of AI product development and healthcare regulation positions me to define Veeva's AI product roadmap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $210,000 base with $200,000 in RSUs over 4 years (~870 shares at ~$230/share). Your accept-at floor should be $290,000 total comp. Cite the life sciences domain expertise premium, the Vault platform roadmap ownership, and the difficulty of finding PMs who understand pharmaceutical regulatory requirements. For East Coast, open at $195,000 base; for Europe, open at EUR 95,000 base.
