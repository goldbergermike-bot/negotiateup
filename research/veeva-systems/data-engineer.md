#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Veeva Systems

Data Engineers at Veeva build and maintain the data infrastructure that pharmaceutical companies trust with their most sensitive information — clinical trial data, patient records, regulatory submissions, and commercial intelligence. Every pipeline must be auditable, every data transformation must be traceable, and every storage system must meet FDA and HIPAA requirements.

Veeva's Data Cloud products (Compass, Andi, Link) represent a massive growth opportunity, and Data Engineers are the backbone of this expansion. Building data pipelines that can ingest, normalize, and serve pharmaceutical data at scale — while maintaining regulatory compliance — requires a rare combination of data engineering skills and life sciences domain knowledge.

#### Veeva Systems Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Veeva Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Data Engineer | DE (IC3-IC4) | 2–5 years |
| Senior Data Engineer | Senior DE (IC5) | 5–8 years |
| Staff Data Engineer | Staff DE (IC6) | 8–12 years |
| Principal Data Engineer | Principal DE (IC7) | 12+ years |

### Veeva Vault Platform & Life Sciences Cloud Premium

Data Engineers on the Vault platform build the data layer that stores and processes the most critical pharmaceutical data in the industry. Frame your negotiation: "I build data pipelines that must meet FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements for every data transformation, every storage operation, and every access event. This compliance-grade data engineering is unique to Veeva and commands a premium."

#### Global Lever 1: Vault Platform Migration

Data migration is the most complex aspect of the Vault transition: "I will design and execute the data migration strategy from Salesforce to Vault — moving petabytes of regulatory-critical data with zero data loss and full audit trail preservation. This is the highest-risk component of the platform migration."

#### Global Lever 2: Regulatory Compliance Engineering

Data compliance is foundational: "Every data pipeline I build includes complete audit trails, data lineage tracking, and access controls that satisfy FDA and EMA requirements. This compliance-first data engineering is Veeva's core competency."

#### Global Lever 3: Clinical & Commercial Cloud Expansion

Data powers clinical and commercial products: "I will build the data infrastructure for [Vault CDMS / Data Cloud / Commercial analytics], enabling pharmaceutical companies to derive insights from their clinical and commercial data. My pipelines directly enable product capabilities that drive revenue."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Cloud & AI in Life Sciences

Data Engineers enable AI: "Veeva's AI capabilities depend on clean, compliant, well-structured data. I build the data infrastructure that makes AI possible in life sciences — from training data pipelines to feature stores to real-time inference data feeds."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $195,000 base with $170,000 in RSUs over 4 years (~739 shares at ~$230/share). Your accept-at floor should be $265,000 total comp. Cite the regulatory data engineering premium, the Vault data migration complexity, and your compliance-grade pipeline expertise. For East Coast, open at $180,000 base; for Europe, open at EUR 82,000 base.
