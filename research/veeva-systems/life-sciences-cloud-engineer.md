This role commands the highest compensation bands within Veeva's engineering organization due to the combination of life sciences domain expertise and cloud platform engineering. At ~$230/share, Staff+ RSU grants of 1,000-1,500 shares represent $230,000-$345,000 in equity over four years.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Veeva Systems

The Life Sciences Cloud Engineer role exists because Veeva recognized that building regulatory-grade cloud infrastructure for the pharmaceutical industry requires a dedicated engineering function that spans platform architecture, regulatory compliance, and life sciences domain expertise. This is not a standard cloud engineering role — it is the synthesis of three scarce skill sets that defines Veeva's competitive moat.

Veeva's $35B market cap is built on one foundational truth: pharmaceutical companies trust Veeva with their most critical data — clinical trial records, regulatory submissions, quality events, and commercial intelligence. Life Sciences Cloud Engineers are the people who earn and maintain that trust through the systems they build. Every architectural decision you make impacts patient safety, regulatory compliance, and Veeva's market position.

The Vault platform migration makes this role more critical than ever. Life Sciences Cloud Engineers are designing the next-generation infrastructure that must satisfy FDA, EMA, PMDA, and other global regulatory bodies while delivering modern cloud performance, scalability, and developer experience. The intersection of regulatory expertise and cloud engineering is one of the rarest skill combinations in technology.

#### Veeva Systems Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Veeva Internal Level | Typical YoE | Focus Area |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| Life Sciences Cloud Engineer | LSCE (IC4) | 3–5 years | Feature-level compliance and cloud work |
| Senior Life Sciences Cloud Engineer | Sr LSCE (IC5) | 5–8 years | Subsystem ownership, regulatory architecture |
| Staff Life Sciences Cloud Engineer | Staff LSCE (IC6) | 8–12 years | Cross-product compliance platform design |
| Principal Life Sciences Cloud Architect | Principal (IC7) | 12+ years | Company-wide regulatory infrastructure strategy |

*Note: This role maps to the highest compensation bands within Veeva's engineering organization. Staff+ Life Sciences Cloud Engineers are compensated at parity with or above Staff SWEs in other product areas due to the combined regulatory and platform expertise required.*

### Veeva Vault Platform & Life Sciences Cloud Premium

As the Life Sciences Cloud Engineer, the Vault platform is not just one of your levers — it is your entire negotiation thesis. You are the person building the regulatory-grade cloud infrastructure that the CEO, the board, and every major pharmaceutical customer depend on. The Vault migration from Salesforce is the most important engineering initiative in Veeva's history, and Life Sciences Cloud Engineers are the architects of its success.

The life sciences cloud demands capabilities that no other industry requires at this scale: 21 CFR Part 11 electronic signatures, complete audit trails for every data change, GxP validation for every deployment, computer system validation (CSV) documentation, and multi-region data residency for global regulatory submissions. Building these capabilities into a modern cloud platform — without sacrificing performance or developer experience — is the defining engineering challenge at Veeva.

Use this in every negotiation: "Veeva's $35B market cap depends on pharmaceutical companies trusting the platform with their most critical data. I am the engineer who builds and maintains that trust through regulatory-grade cloud infrastructure. My combination of life sciences domain expertise and cloud platform engineering is the exact skill set that defines Veeva's competitive moat."

#### Global Lever 1: Vault Platform Migration

The Life Sciences Cloud Engineer is the bridge between Vault's cloud architecture and its regulatory requirements: "I will ensure that every aspect of the Vault platform migration meets or exceeds current regulatory standards while delivering modern cloud performance. My experience in [cloud platform engineering / FDA compliance / GxP validation] makes me uniquely qualified to lead this critical intersection of technology and regulation."

#### Global Lever 2: Regulatory Compliance Engineering

This is your primary domain: "I design cloud infrastructure that is regulatory-compliant by architecture, not by afterthought. Every API, database schema, and deployment pipeline I build includes 21 CFR Part 11 compliance, audit trails, and validation hooks. This architectural approach to compliance is what separates Veeva from every competitor and is the foundation of the company's $35B valuation."

#### Global Lever 3: Clinical & Commercial Cloud Expansion

Life Sciences Cloud Engineers enable every product team to build compliant features faster: "My work on the regulatory infrastructure layer accelerates development across all of Veeva's clinical and commercial products — Vault CDMS, Vault RIM, Vault QMS, and Commercial Cloud. Every product team depends on the compliance platform I build."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Cloud & AI in Life Sciences

AI in life sciences introduces novel regulatory challenges: "Integrating AI into FDA-regulated workflows requires a new category of compliance engineering — model validation, algorithmic audit trails, and explainability requirements. My combination of regulatory expertise and cloud engineering positions me to architect Veeva's AI compliance framework, which will be a critical differentiator as AI adoption accelerates in life sciences."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $215,000 base with $250,000 in RSUs over 4 years (~1,087 shares at ~$230/share). Your accept-at floor should be $320,000 total comp. Cite Veeva's $35B market cap, the Vault platform migration, the regulatory specialization premium, and the extreme scarcity of engineers who combine life sciences domain expertise with cloud platform skills. For East Coast, open at $200,000 base; for Europe, open at EUR 95,000 base with proportional equity. Push hard on RSU grants — the equity upside from the Vault migration should be substantial.
