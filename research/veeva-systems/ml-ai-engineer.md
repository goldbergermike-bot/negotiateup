### ML/AI Engineer — Veeva Systems Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers at Veeva Systems build intelligent systems for the life sciences industry — where AI must meet FDA validation standards, pharmaceutical privacy requirements, and clinical accuracy thresholds that make this one of the most demanding AI engineering environments in the world.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Bay Area / Pleasanton (USD) | Boston / East Coast (USD) | Europe (EUR/GBP) |
|-------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $165,000–$220,000 | $155,000–$205,000 | €60,000–€90,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary ($160K-$215K), RSU grants ($100K-$230K/4yr), and 10% performance bonus. Veeva (NYSE: VEEV) at ~$230/share. AI roles command a 10-15% premium over standard SWE bands due to talent scarcity.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Veeva Systems

ML/AI Engineers at Veeva face a unique challenge: building AI systems that must meet pharmaceutical regulatory standards. FDA guidance on AI/ML in drug development, clinical decision support, and commercial analytics creates compliance requirements that standard AI engineering roles don't encounter. Engineers who can build AI systems that are both powerful and FDA-validatable are exceptionally rare.

Veeva's $35B market cap and dominant position in life sciences create an unmatched dataset for training pharmaceutical AI models. Clinical trial data, regulatory submission patterns, prescriber behavior, and commercial intelligence — all within the Veeva platform — provide the training data for AI systems that no competitor can replicate.

#### Veeva Systems Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Veeva Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| ML/AI Engineer | ML (IC3-IC4) | 2–5 years |
| Senior ML/AI Engineer | Senior ML (IC5) | 5–8 years |
| Staff ML/AI Engineer | Staff ML (IC6) | 8–12 years |
| Principal ML/AI Architect | Principal ML (IC7) | 12+ years |

### Veeva Vault Platform & Life Sciences Cloud Premium

AI integration into the Vault platform represents Veeva's next major growth vector. Frame your negotiation: "I build AI systems that meet FDA validation requirements — from model documentation to algorithmic audit trails to explainability features. This regulated AI expertise is the key to integrating intelligence into Veeva's life sciences platform."

#### Global Lever 1: Vault Platform Migration

AI-assisted migration: "I apply ML methods to optimize the Vault migration — automated data mapping, intelligent testing prioritization, and predictive risk modeling for the most complex platform transition in life sciences technology."

#### Global Lever 2: Regulatory Compliance Engineering

AI for compliance: "I build AI systems that automate regulatory compliance — from intelligent document classification to automated submission review to anomaly detection in audit trails. Every model I build must itself meet validation requirements, making this doubly complex."

#### Global Lever 3: Clinical & Commercial Cloud Expansion

AI-powered products: "I build the ML models that power Veeva's next generation of clinical and commercial products — from clinical trial site selection to prescriber engagement optimization to drug safety signal detection."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Cloud & AI in Life Sciences

Core AI platform: "I architect the ML infrastructure that enables AI across Veeva's entire product portfolio — model training pipelines, feature stores, inference services, and monitoring systems, all built to pharmaceutical regulatory standards."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $210,000 base with $200,000 in RSUs over 4 years (~870 shares at ~$230/share). Your accept-at floor should be $290,000 total comp. Cite the regulated AI premium, the pharmaceutical dataset advantage, and competing offers from AI labs or healthcare-tech companies. For East Coast, open at $195,000 base; for Europe, open at EUR 90,000 base.
