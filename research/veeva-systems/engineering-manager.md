#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Veeva Systems

Engineering Managers at Veeva are responsible for the most consequential teams in life sciences technology. Your teams build systems that directly impact clinical trial operations, regulatory submissions, and drug commercialization. The regulatory environment means that engineering management at Veeva requires understanding FDA compliance, GxP validation, and the unique quality standards of pharmaceutical software development.

Veeva's Vault platform migration requires EMs who can manage complex, multi-quarter deliveries while maintaining regulatory compliance and zero-downtime operations for clinical trial systems. The management complexity — balancing migration velocity with compliance rigor — is unique to Veeva and justifies premium compensation.

### Veeva Vault Platform & Life Sciences Cloud Premium

As an Engineering Manager on the Vault platform, you lead teams through the most complex platform migration in life sciences technology. Your ability to recruit, retain, and develop engineers who can build FDA-compliant cloud systems is Veeva's primary competitive advantage. Frame your negotiation: "I lead engineering teams through regulatory-grade platform development. My ability to balance compliance requirements with engineering velocity directly impacts Vault's migration timeline and Veeva's competitive position."

#### Global Lever 1: Vault Platform Migration

EMs drive the Vault migration through team execution: "I will lead a team of [X] engineers on the Vault platform migration. My experience managing complex platform transitions — while maintaining production stability — directly applies to the most important engineering initiative at Veeva."

#### Global Lever 2: Regulatory Compliance Engineering

EMs must ensure their teams build compliant systems: "I manage engineering teams in FDA-regulated environments. I ensure that every feature, every deployment, and every code review meets GxP validation requirements. This regulatory management expertise is rare and critical for Veeva."

#### Global Lever 3: Clinical & Commercial Cloud Expansion

EMs own product delivery for clinical and commercial cloud products: "I will own engineering delivery for [specific product area], managing the full lifecycle from design through FDA-compliant deployment. My leadership directly impacts product revenue and customer satisfaction for Veeva's largest pharmaceutical clients."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Cloud & AI in Life Sciences

EMs position their teams for AI-driven development: "I will build and lead a team focused on AI integration in life sciences workflows. Recruiting and retaining AI engineers for healthcare-regulated environments requires specialized management — I bring both AI team leadership experience and regulatory awareness."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $230,000 base with $220,000 in RSUs over 4 years (~957 shares at ~$230/share). Your accept-at floor should be $320,000 total comp. Cite the Vault migration management complexity, the regulatory team leadership premium, and the difficulty of recruiting engineers with life sciences expertise. For East Coast, open at $215,000 base; for Europe, open at EUR 120,000 base.
