**Negotiation DNA**

EMs at Anduril build and lead teams shipping defense software at startup speed. Unlike traditional defense primes where EMs manage large bureaucratic teams, Anduril EMs lead small, elite teams (5-12 engineers) that ship weekly to combat-deployed systems. You manage across the full stack: autonomy, perception, platform, infrastructure, and edge deployment. The recruiting challenge is unique -- you must attract Silicon Valley talent to defense work, which requires selling mission and equity to engineers who could make more at FAANG with less intensity. Retention in defense tech is harder than in consumer tech due to clearance requirements and the emotional weight of building weapons systems. [Source: Anduril EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Anduril EM = Google L5-L6 Manager = Meta M1-M2 -- with defense recruiting challenges and combat-deployed team output

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Elite Team Building in Defense:** "Recruiting top Silicon Valley engineers to defense is the hardest recruiting challenge in tech. My ability to attract and retain this talent is extraordinarily valuable."
- **Combat-Deployed Team Output:** "My team ships software that deploys to combat zones. The quality bar is life-or-death, not conversion rates."
- **Startup Speed Management:** "I manage at startup speed in defense -- weekly deployments on systems that traditional primes take years to ship."

**Global Levers**

1. **Defense Talent Recruiting:** "Attracting Silicon Valley talent to defense is Anduril's biggest challenge. My team-building capability directly determines engineering capacity."
2. **Combat-Deployed Team Leadership:** "My team's output deploys to combat -- the highest quality bar in software. Team leadership at this consequence level is rare."
3. **IPO-Trajectory Team Building:** "I'm building the engineering teams that will drive Anduril through IPO. My teams' output determines the company's valuation trajectory."
4. **Retention in High-Intensity Defense:** "Retaining engineers who could earn more at FAANG is my core challenge. Each retained engineer saves $400K+ in recruiting costs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build and retain elite engineering teams shipping combat-deployed software at startup speed -- the hardest team-building challenge in tech. My team's output directly determines Anduril's contract wins and IPO trajectory. I'm targeting $370K in equity over 4 years. My competing EM offer from [Google/Meta] is $430K total comp with liquidity and easier recruiting. Anduril's defense mission and IPO trajectory must compensate." Accept at $320K+ equity.
