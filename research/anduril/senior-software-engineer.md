**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at Anduril own critical subsystems across the Lattice platform and autonomous product lines. At this level, you're the technical lead on systems that warfighters depend on in combat: real-time sensor processing, autonomous navigation, electronic warfare countermeasures, or battlefield communications. Anduril's lean team structure means senior engineers own scope that would be distributed across 2-3 engineers at FAANG. The difference from traditional defense: you ship weekly, iterate on real battlefield feedback, and own your code end-to-end from prototype to production deployment. Senior engineers are expected to make high-consequence architectural decisions with minimal oversight. [Source: Anduril Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Anduril Senior SWE = Google L4-L5 = Meta E4-E5 -- with autonomous systems and defense-grade reliability requirements

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Combat-Deployed Software:** "My software deploys to combat zones. The feedback loop is real battlefield performance, not A/B test metrics."
- **Lean Team, Outsized Scope:** "I own systems that would require 2-3 FAANG engineers. My per-engineer impact on warfighter capability is exceptional."
- **Rapid Iteration on Defense:** "I ship weekly on defense systems -- speed that defense primes can't match. This velocity is my competitive advantage."

**Global Levers**

1. **Battlefield-Deployed Software:** "My code runs in combat environments. This is the highest-consequence software deployment in the industry."
2. **$14B+ Valuation Growth:** "Anduril's valuation trajectory -- from $1B to $14B+ in 4 years -- makes early equity grants extraordinarily valuable."
3. **Autonomous Systems Ownership:** "I own autonomous subsystems end-to-end: perception, planning, and control for defense drones and vehicles."
4. **Defense + Tech Dual Skill:** "My combination of defense domain expertise and Silicon Valley engineering practices makes me valuable to both sectors."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I own autonomous subsystems that deploy to combat zones -- the highest-consequence software in the industry. Anduril's lean team means my scope is 2-3x FAANG equivalents. I'm targeting $295K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [Google/Palantir] is $340K total comp with liquidity. Anduril's growth trajectory from $1B to $14B+ makes early equity compelling -- but the grant must reflect my scope." Accept at $255K+ equity.
