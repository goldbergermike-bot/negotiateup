**Negotiation DNA**

Staff SWEs at Anduril define the technical direction for entire product lines or platform domains. You architect systems that span the Lattice platform, autonomous vehicle software stacks, electronic warfare systems, or undersea autonomy. At Staff level, you interface directly with leadership (including Palmer Luckey) on technical strategy, make architectural decisions that affect multiple product lines, and set engineering standards across the company. Anduril's growth from $1B to $14B+ in 4 years means Staff engineers who joined early hold equity grants that are now worth millions. The IPO thesis is real -- Anduril is expected to go public within 2-4 years. Staff equity grants today capture the remaining pre-IPO appreciation. [Source: Anduril Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Product Architecture:** "My technical decisions span Ghost drones, Altius munitions, Dive torpedoes, and the Lattice platform. This cross-product impact is unique."
2. **IPO Proximity Equity:** "Anduril is expected to IPO within 2-4 years. Staff equity grants now represent the final pre-IPO appreciation opportunity."
3. **$14B+ to IPO Growth:** "From $14B private to public company, my equity captures significant remaining upside. Early Staff engineers' grants are already worth millions."
4. **Defense Industry Technical Leadership:** "I set standards that determine whether Anduril wins or loses billion-dollar defense contracts."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I architect systems spanning multiple product lines and the Lattice platform -- decisions that directly determine Anduril's contract win rate. Staff equity now captures the final pre-IPO appreciation window. I'm targeting $420K in equity over 4 years. My competing Staff offer from [Google/Meta] is $530K total comp with full liquidity. Anduril's IPO trajectory and my cross-product architectural impact must bridge the gap." Accept at $370K+ equity.
