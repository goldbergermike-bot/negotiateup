**Negotiation DNA**

Anduril is the fastest-growing defense company in a generation, valued at $14B+ and building the future of software-defined defense. Founded by Palmer Luckey (Oculus founder), Anduril brings Silicon Valley speed and culture to defense technology. SWEs build across the Lattice platform (AI-powered C2), autonomous systems (Ghost drones, Altius, Dive), sensor networks (Sentry towers), and counter-drone systems. Unlike traditional defense primes (Lockheed, Raytheon), Anduril ships software weekly, not yearly. The culture is intense startup energy applied to national security -- meaningful work with real mission impact. Comp is competitive with FAANG on a total comp basis when equity appreciation is factored in. Bonus is 10-15% (unlike SpaceX which has no guaranteed bonus). Equity is illiquid but the $14B+ valuation has been growing rapidly. [Source: Anduril SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Anduril SWE = Google L3-L4 = Meta E3-E4 -- with defense domain and clearance requirements

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Startup Speed, Defense Stakes:** "Anduril ships at startup speed on defense problems. I move faster than Lockheed engineers but with higher stakes than consumer tech."
- **Equity Growth Thesis:** "Anduril's $14B+ valuation is growing rapidly as the DOD shifts to software-defined defense. My equity captures this generational shift."
- **Mission Premium:** "I'm building technology that protects warfighters and national security. This mission motivation justifies accepting illiquidity -- but the equity grant must be sufficient."

**Global Levers**

1. **$14B+ Growth Trajectory:** "Anduril is the fastest-growing defense tech company. The DOD software-defined defense pivot is a $100B+ TAM. My equity participates in this."
2. **Silicon Valley Speed in Defense:** "I ship software weekly at Anduril vs. yearly at defense primes. This velocity makes Anduril's win rate dramatically higher on new contracts."
3. **Full-Stack Defense Software:** "I build across autonomy, sensor fusion, C2, and edge computing -- skills that span both defense and commercial tech."
4. **Bonus Advantage Over SpaceX:** "Anduril pays 10-15% bonus, unlike SpaceX which pays zero. This guaranteed cash component reduces my risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about Anduril's $14B+ trajectory and the DOD software-defined defense opportunity. I accept the defense intensity and clearance requirements. I'm targeting $230K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [FAANG/SpaceX] is $250K total comp. Anduril's bonus helps, but the equity must reflect the generational defense tech opportunity." Accept at $195K+ equity.
