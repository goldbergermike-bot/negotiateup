### Data Scientist | Anduril Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Defense Tech Equity + Mission Premium | $14B+ Private Valuation | Defense AI Analytics/Autonomy | High-Intensity Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Costa Mesa, CA | $150K-$210K | $90K-$260K | 10-15% | $200K-$350K |
| Seattle, WA | $150K-$210K | $90K-$260K | 10-15% | $200K-$350K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Anduril work on defense analytics problems that don't exist in commercial tech: modeling threat detection probability from sensor networks, optimizing drone swarm coverage patterns, analyzing electronic warfare effectiveness, and predicting adversary behavior from multi-source intelligence. Your models directly inform warfighter decisions -- false negatives mean missed threats, false positives mean wasted resources in combat. The data domain is unique: radar cross-sections, acoustic signatures, geospatial intelligence, signals intelligence, and order of battle data. Model performance is measured in operational effectiveness, not click-through rates. [Source: Anduril DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Anduril DS = Google L4 DS = Palantir DS -- with defense-specific analytical domains

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Operational Consequence Models:** "My models directly inform combat decisions. False negatives mean missed threats -- the consequence of model error is measured in lives, not revenue."
- **Unique Defense Data Domains:** "Radar cross-sections, acoustic signatures, SIGINT -- these data domains are exclusive to defense. My expertise is developed here and doesn't transfer to ad tech."
- **Adversary Behavior Modeling:** "I model adversary behavior from multi-source intelligence. This is the most consequential predictive modeling in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **Combat Decision Analytics:** "My models inform warfighter decisions in combat. Model accuracy has operational life-or-death consequences."
2. **Unique Defense Data Expertise:** "Radar, sonar, SIGINT analytics are skills that exist at very few companies. This domain expertise commands a scarcity premium."
3. **Autonomous System Optimization:** "I optimize drone swarm coverage and autonomous system behavior. This is applied optimization at the highest consequence level."
4. **$14B+ Growth Trajectory:** "My analytical models improve Anduril's product effectiveness, which drives contract wins and valuation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build models with combat-consequence accuracy requirements -- false negatives mean missed threats. My defense data science domain (radar, sonar, SIGINT) doesn't exist in commercial tech. I'm targeting $240K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [FAANG] is $290K total comp for consumer analytics. Anduril's unique mission and equity trajectory must compensate." Accept at $205K+ equity.
