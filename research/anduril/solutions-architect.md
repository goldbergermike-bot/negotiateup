### Solutions Architect | Anduril Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Defense Tech Equity + Mission Premium | $14B+ Private Valuation | Defense Integration/Lattice Deployment | High-Intensity Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Costa Mesa, CA | $165K-$220K | $100K-$280K | 10-15% | $225K-$380K |
| Washington, DC | $165K-$220K | $100K-$280K | 10-15% | $225K-$380K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Anduril design and deploy Lattice integrations for military customers. You work directly with combatant commands, military branches, and allied nations to architect how Lattice integrates with existing military C2 systems, sensor networks, and weapons platforms. Each deployment is unique: integrating Lattice with Navy combat systems requires different architecture than Army tactical networks or Air Force ISR platforms. SAs travel extensively (40-60%) to military installations, conduct technical demonstrations at defense exhibitions, and support classified program evaluations. Your architectural designs directly determine contract win rates -- a compelling technical architecture is often the difference between winning and losing a $500M program.

**Level Mapping:** Anduril SA = AWS Senior SA = Palantir FDE -- with military systems integration and classified environment deployment

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Direct Revenue Attribution:** "My technical architectures directly win defense contracts. Each design demonstration is a $100M-$1B revenue opportunity."
- **Military Systems Integration:** "I integrate Lattice with Navy, Army, and Air Force systems. Military C2 integration is a rare and valuable specialty."
- **Extensive Travel to Military Installations:** "40-60% travel to military bases and classified facilities. The travel burden and clearance requirements constrain my lifestyle."

**Global Levers**

1. **Contract-Winning Architecture:** "My technical architectures directly win or lose $100M-$1B defense contracts. I'm a direct revenue generator."
2. **Military C2 Integration Expertise:** "Integrating with existing military command and control systems is a rare skill. Few engineers understand both modern software and legacy military systems."
3. **Multi-Branch Deployment:** "I architect deployments across Navy, Army, Air Force, and SOCOM. Cross-branch integration expertise is exceptionally rare."
4. **$14B+ Growth -- SA as Revenue Engine:** "SAs are Anduril's primary revenue generation mechanism. My technical demonstrations directly drive contract awards."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "My architectural designs directly win $100M-$1B defense contracts -- I'm a measurable revenue generator. Military C2 integration across multiple branches is an exceptionally rare skill. I'm targeting $260K in equity over 4 years with 40-60% travel to classified facilities. My competing offer from [AWS/Palantir] is $310K total comp with less travel. Anduril's contract pipeline and equity trajectory must compensate." Accept at $225K+ equity.
