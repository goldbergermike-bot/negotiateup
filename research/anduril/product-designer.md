**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Anduril design the interfaces that warfighters use in combat to control autonomous systems, process sensor data, and make tactical decisions. The Lattice interface is where human operators interact with AI-powered autonomy -- your design decisions determine how quickly a naval commander can identify threats, how effectively a special operator controls a drone swarm, and how clearly an intelligence analyst sees the battlefield picture. This is the highest-consequence UX design in the world: bad design costs lives. The user base includes special forces operators, naval combat centers, and intelligence analysts -- users under extreme stress making life-or-death decisions with your interface. Design research happens on military bases, not in usability labs. [Source: Anduril Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Anduril Product Designer = Google L4-L5 UX = Palantir Designer -- with military operator UX and tactical interface design

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Combat-Critical UX:** "My interfaces are used in combat by operators under extreme stress. Bad UX means slower decisions, which means lives lost. This is the highest-stakes design work."
- **Military User Research:** "My user research happens on military bases with warfighters. Understanding military operators requires domain expertise that consumer designers don't have."
- **Tactical Interface Design:** "I design interfaces for autonomous systems, sensor fusion, and tactical decision-making. This design domain is completely unique."

**Global Levers**

1. **Life-or-Death UX Consequences:** "My design decisions directly impact warfighter effectiveness in combat. This is the highest-consequence design work in the industry."
2. **Military Operator UX Scarcity:** "Designers who can do user research with special operators and design combat interfaces are extraordinarily rare."
3. **Lattice Platform Design:** "I design the interface for Anduril's core platform. Lattice's usability directly determines customer satisfaction and contract renewals."
4. **$14B+ IPO Trajectory:** "My design quality drives product adoption, which drives contract wins, which drives IPO valuation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I design combat interfaces where bad UX costs lives -- the highest-consequence design work in tech. Military operator UX designers are extraordinarily rare. I'm targeting $210K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [FAANG] is $280K total comp for consumer design. Anduril's mission and IPO trajectory must compensate for the unique intensity."
