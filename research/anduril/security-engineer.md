**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Anduril protect defense technology systems targeted by nation-state adversaries. You secure autonomous weapons systems, classified sensor networks, the Lattice platform, and cross-domain transfer infrastructure. Anduril handles CUI, Secret, and TS/SCI data, requiring CMMC compliance and multiple security frameworks simultaneously. The attack surface is unique: autonomous drones that could be hijacked, sensor networks that could be poisoned, and AI decision systems that could be manipulated. A security breach could compromise military operations, expose classified intelligence, or allow adversaries to take control of autonomous weapons. Security clearance (TS/SCI) is typically required.

**Level Mapping:** Anduril Security Eng = Google L4-L5 Security = CrowdStrike Senior -- with autonomous weapons security and classified systems

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Autonomous Weapons Security:** "I secure autonomous systems that make lethal decisions. A security breach could allow adversaries to control weapons. This is the highest-consequence security work."
- **Nation-State Adversary Defense:** "I defend against China, Russia, and other nation-state cyber programs targeting defense technology. The threat sophistication is maximum."
- **Multi-Classification Security:** "I manage security across unclassified, CUI, Secret, and TS/SCI environments simultaneously. Multi-classification security is extraordinarily complex."

**Global Levers**

1. **Autonomous Weapons Security:** "Securing autonomous weapons systems against adversary takeover is the highest-consequence security engineering in the world."
2. **Nation-State Defense:** "I defend against the most sophisticated cyber adversaries targeting defense technology."
3. **TS/SCI Clearance Premium:** "TS/SCI clearance constrains my career, personal travel, and relationships. This constraint deserves a 15-20% premium."
4. **CMMC Compliance Expertise:** "CMMC and defense security framework expertise is scarce and increasingly in demand as DOD enforces compliance."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I secure autonomous weapons systems against nation-state adversaries -- the highest-consequence security work in the industry. My TS/SCI clearance constrains my career and personal life. I'm targeting $260K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto] is $320K total comp with no clearance constraints. Anduril's mission and equity trajectory must compensate for the security constraints." Accept at $225K+ equity.
