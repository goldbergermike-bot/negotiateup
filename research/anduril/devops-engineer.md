### DevOps Engineer | Anduril Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Defense Tech Equity + Mission Premium | $14B+ Private Valuation | Defense Infrastructure/Edge Deployment | High-Intensity Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Costa Mesa, CA | $150K-$205K | $85K-$245K | 10-15% | $195K-$340K |
| Seattle, WA | $150K-$205K | $85K-$245K | 10-15% | $195K-$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Anduril manage infrastructure that spans cloud environments, edge deployments on military bases, air-gapped classified networks, and embedded systems on autonomous vehicles. This is not standard cloud DevOps -- you deploy software to drones, submarines, forward operating bases, and naval vessels with intermittent or no connectivity. Your CI/CD pipelines must handle classified code, cross-domain transfers, and deployment to hardware platforms in the field. Infrastructure reliability directly impacts warfighter capability -- if your deployment pipeline breaks, soldiers in the field don't get critical software updates. Anduril's weekly shipping cadence on defense systems requires DevOps practices that are orders of magnitude more complex than consumer tech. [Source: Anduril DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Anduril DevOps = Google L4 SRE = Amazon Senior SysDE -- with classified networks, edge infrastructure, and embedded systems

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Classified + Edge + Embedded:** "I manage infrastructure across cloud, classified air-gapped networks, edge field deployments, and embedded drone systems. This multi-domain infrastructure scope doesn't exist elsewhere."
- **Weekly Deployment to Warzones:** "Anduril ships weekly to combat-deployed systems. My CI/CD pipeline delivers software updates to active military operations."
- **Cross-Domain Infrastructure:** "I manage cross-domain transfer infrastructure between classification levels. This is the most complex DevOps in the industry."

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Domain Infrastructure:** "Cloud + classified + edge + embedded -- I manage four completely different infrastructure domains simultaneously."
2. **Combat-Deployed CI/CD:** "My deployment pipeline delivers software to active military operations weekly. Pipeline failures mean warfighters don't get critical updates."
3. **Classified Infrastructure Premium:** "Air-gapped network infrastructure management requires clearance and specialized skills that cloud DevOps engineers don't develop."
4. **$14B+ Growth Trajectory:** "Infrastructure reliability enables Anduril's weekly shipping cadence, which drives contract wins and growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage the most complex DevOps in the industry: cloud + classified + edge + embedded infrastructure with weekly deployments to combat zones. My CI/CD pipeline delivers software to active military operations. I'm targeting $225K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [FAANG] is $280K total comp for cloud-only infrastructure. Anduril's multi-domain infrastructure challenge and equity trajectory must compensate." Accept at $190K+ equity.
