**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at Anduril define product strategy for the most consequential software-hardware systems in defense. You own the product roadmap for autonomous systems (Ghost, Altius, Dive), the Lattice platform, counter-drone systems, or electronic warfare products. Anduril PMs work directly with military end users -- special operators, naval commanders, intelligence analysts -- to understand operational requirements and translate them into product features. Unlike FAANG PMs who optimize metrics, Anduril PMs optimize warfighter capability. The customer is the DOD, and the "user research" happens on military bases and in warzones. PM must be able to earn credibility with both Silicon Valley engineers and military operators -- a rare combination. [Source: Anduril PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Anduril PM = Google L5 PM = Palantir Forward Deployed PM -- with hardware-software integration and military customer interaction

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Military Customer Interaction:** "I work directly with warfighters -- special operators, commanders, analysts. My user research happens in military environments, not conference rooms."
- **Hardware-Software PM:** "I manage products spanning autonomous vehicles, software platforms, and sensor systems. Hardware-software PM is rarer than pure software PM."
- **Contract-Driven Product Strategy:** "My product roadmap directly determines billion-dollar contract wins. Product strategy = revenue strategy in defense."

**Global Levers**

1. **Warfighter-Facing Product Strategy:** "I translate military operator needs into product features. This customer intimacy drives product-market fit in a market where bad PMF means lost contracts and lives."
2. **Contract Revenue Impact:** "My product roadmap directly determines which contracts Anduril wins. Each major contract is $100M-$1B+."
3. **Hardware-Software Product Scope:** "I manage across autonomous vehicles, AI platforms, and sensor networks. This cross-domain PM scope is unique to defense tech."
4. **$14B+ IPO Trajectory:** "My product strategy shapes Anduril's contract pipeline, which determines IPO valuation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I define product strategy that directly determines billion-dollar defense contract wins. My PM scope spans autonomous systems, AI platforms, and sensor networks -- with military end users as my customers. I'm targeting $275K in equity over 4 years. My competing PM offer from [Google/Meta] is $340K total comp for consumer product optimization. Anduril's defense impact and IPO trajectory must bridge the gap." Accept at $235K+ equity.
