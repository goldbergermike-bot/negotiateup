**Negotiation DNA**

TPMs at Anduril manage defense programs that span hardware, software, autonomy, and military customer delivery. You coordinate development of autonomous systems (Ghost, Altius, Dive), Lattice platform releases, and customer deployment programs for DOD customers. Unlike traditional defense TPMs who manage decades-long waterfall programs, Anduril TPMs drive agile delivery on defense timelines -- shipping quarterly to military customers while meeting stringent defense quality and compliance requirements. You manage across Costa Mesa (software), Irvine (hardware manufacturing), and field deployment sites. Program delivery directly determines contract performance evaluations, which determine future contract awards. [Source: Anduril TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Anduril TPM = Google L5-L6 TPM = Amazon Senior TPM -- with defense compliance, hardware-software coordination, and military customer delivery

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Agile Defense Program Management:** "I manage defense programs at startup speed -- agile delivery with defense compliance requirements. This is the hardest program management in tech."
- **Hardware-Software-Autonomy Coordination:** "I coordinate across hardware manufacturing, software development, and autonomous systems testing. Three-domain program management is rare."
- **Contract Performance = Future Revenue:** "My program delivery performance directly determines contract evaluation scores, which determine future billion-dollar awards."

**Global Levers**

1. **Agile + Defense Compliance:** "Shipping quarterly to DOD while meeting CMMC, ITAR, and defense quality requirements is the most complex program management challenge in tech."
2. **Multi-Domain Delivery:** "Hardware + software + autonomy program management across manufacturing and field deployment is a rare skill combination."
3. **Contract Performance Impact:** "My delivery performance directly determines contract evaluations. Strong performance wins follow-on contracts worth $100M+."
4. **$14B+ Growth -- Program Execution:** "Anduril's growth depends on program execution. My delivery capability directly drives revenue and valuation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I manage defense programs spanning hardware, software, and autonomy at startup speed with defense compliance -- the most complex program management in tech. My delivery performance directly determines billion-dollar contract evaluations. I'm targeting $270K in equity over 4 years. My competing TPM offer from [Google/Amazon] is $320K total comp for software-only programs. Anduril's multi-domain program complexity and equity trajectory must compensate." Accept at $230K+ equity.
