### Data Engineer | Anduril Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Defense Tech Equity + Mission Premium | $14B+ Private Valuation | Defense Sensor Data/Lattice Infrastructure | High-Intensity Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Costa Mesa, CA | $150K-$210K | $90K-$260K | 10-15% | $200K-$350K |
| Seattle, WA | $150K-$210K | $90K-$260K | 10-15% | $200K-$350K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Anduril build the data infrastructure that powers Lattice's sensor fusion and AI decision-making capabilities. You process data from radar systems, electro-optical sensors, sonar arrays, satellite feeds, and signals intelligence into the unified data layer that Lattice uses for autonomous decision support. This is not standard ETL -- this is real-time, multi-modal sensor data processing where latency directly impacts tactical decision-making. Data pipelines must run at edge locations (forward operating bases, ships) with limited connectivity, and must handle classified data in air-gapped environments. The data domain is unique: electromagnetic spectrum data, acoustic signatures, orbital mechanics, and geospatial intelligence. [Source: Anduril DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Anduril DE = Google L4 DE = Palantir DE -- with real-time sensor data and classified environments

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Real-Time Tactical Data:** "My data pipelines process sensor data at tactical speed -- millisecond latency for threat detection. Pipeline failures degrade warfighter situational awareness."
- **Multi-Modal Sensor Data:** "Radar, EO/IR, sonar, SIGINT, satellite -- I process data types that don't exist in commercial tech."
- **Edge + Classified Data Engineering:** "I build data pipelines for edge environments and air-gapped classified networks. This is fundamentally different from cloud data engineering."

**Global Levers**

1. **Tactical Data Infrastructure:** "I build the data layer that powers Lattice's AI. Tactical situational awareness depends on my data pipelines running at millisecond latency."
2. **Multi-Modal Sensor Expertise:** "Processing radar, sonar, SIGINT, and satellite data simultaneously is a skill set that exists at very few companies."
3. **Edge + Classified Data Premium:** "Data engineering in air-gapped, edge environments requires skills that cloud-native DEs don't develop."
4. **$14B+ Growth Trajectory:** "My data infrastructure enables Lattice, which drives every Anduril contract win."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build real-time sensor data infrastructure processing radar, sonar, and satellite feeds at tactical speed -- skills that don't exist in commercial tech. Air-gapped, edge deployment adds complexity that cloud DEs never face. I'm targeting $240K in equity over 4 years. My competing offer from [Databricks/Snowflake] is $310K total comp for cloud-native data engineering. Anduril's unique data domain and equity trajectory must compensate." Accept at $205K+ equity.
