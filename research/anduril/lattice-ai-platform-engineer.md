### Lattice AI Platform Engineer | Anduril Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Growth-Stage Defense Tech Equity + Mission Premium | $14B+ Private Valuation | Defense AI/Autonomy | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+20-30% Platform-Critical Premium** | High-Intensity Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Private/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Costa Mesa, CA | $165K-$225K | $120K-$350K | 10-15% | $225K-$420K |
| Seattle, WA | $165K-$225K | $120K-$350K | 10-15% | $225K-$420K |
| Washington, DC | $160K-$220K | $120K-$350K | 10-15% | $220K-$415K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Anduril's signature engineering role -- Lattice AI Platform Engineer. Lattice is Anduril's operating system for defense: an AI-powered command and control platform that fuses sensor data from drones, satellites, ground sensors, and naval systems into a unified real-time picture, then enables autonomous decision-making at machine speed. Lattice is the central nervous system of Anduril's entire product portfolio -- every autonomous system (Ghost drones, Altius munitions, Dive torpedoes, Sentry towers) runs through Lattice. You build the AI platform that processes battlefield data, enables autonomous engagement decisions, and gives warfighters superhuman situational awareness. Anduril is a $14B+ private company growing rapidly as the DOD shifts toward software-defined defense. Equity is illiquid but appreciating fast as Anduril wins major defense contracts.

**Level Mapping:** Anduril Lattice Platform Eng = Google L4-L5 = Palantir FDE + Google Infrastructure Eng, combined

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Lattice AI Platform Engineer builds the central nervous system of modern defense:
- **Real-Time Sensor Fusion:** You build the platform that fuses data from hundreds of disparate sensors (radar, EO/IR, sonar, satellite, SIGINT) into a unified operational picture at millisecond latency
- **Autonomous Decision Support:** Lattice enables AI-assisted and autonomous engagement decisions -- your platform determines what targets are tracked, prioritized, and potentially engaged
- **Multi-Domain Integration:** Lattice operates across air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains simultaneously -- the most complex systems integration challenge in defense
- **Edge Computing at Scale:** Lattice runs on edge hardware in austere environments -- forward operating bases, naval vessels, and mobile command posts with limited connectivity
- **Kill Chain Software:** Your platform directly participates in the sensor-to-shooter kill chain. This is the most consequential software platform in defense.

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation -- The Lattice Script**

> **"I want to be direct about the Lattice Platform tradeoff. I'm accepting:**
> - **High-intensity startup culture in defense (not consumer tech)**
> - **Kill chain software responsibility -- my platform enables lethal autonomous decisions**
> - **Below-FAANG base with illiquid private equity**
> - **Security clearance requirements constraining career mobility**
> - **Defense-specific platform skills (Lattice) that don't fully transfer to commercial tech**
>
> **In exchange, I need equity that reflects the platform-critical premium and Anduril's $14B+ growth trajectory. The DOD's shift to software-defined defense is a generational opportunity -- my equity must capture it."**

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform-Critical Role (20-30% Premium):** "Lattice IS Anduril's product. Every autonomous system, every sensor, every warfighter decision flows through the platform I build. This is the most critical engineering role in the company."
2. **$14B+ Growth Trajectory:** "Anduril is the fastest-growing defense company in a generation. The DOD's pivot to software-defined defense is a $100B+ market opportunity. My equity captures this trajectory."
3. **Kill Chain Software Premium:** "My platform participates in the sensor-to-shooter kill chain. This is the highest-consequence platform engineering in the defense industry."
4. **Multi-Domain Integration Scarcity:** "Engineers who can build real-time sensor fusion across air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains are extraordinarily rare. This skill set commands a massive scarcity premium."
5. **Clearance Constraint Compensation:** "Security clearance constrains my career mobility and personal life. This constraint deserves a 10-15% compensation premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Lattice is Anduril's central nervous system -- every product, every sensor, every autonomous decision flows through the platform I build. I'm accepting kill chain responsibility, clearance constraints, below-FAANG base, and illiquid equity. I'm targeting $320K in equity over 4 years with the platform-critical premium. My competing offer from [Google/Palantir] is $350K total comp with liquidity and no clearance constraints. Anduril's defense AI opportunity is genuinely generational -- but the equity must make the tradeoffs work." Accept at $280K+ equity.
