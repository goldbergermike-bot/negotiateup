#### Negotiation DNA

Robinhood Data Scientists (IC3-IC4) power the analytical intelligence behind a platform serving 24M+ funded accounts — building the statistical models, causal inference frameworks, and experimentation systems that drive product decisions across trading, crypto, retirement, Gold subscription, and cash management. You are not generating dashboards; you are making the analytical calls that determine which features ship, how products are priced, and how Robinhood allocates hundreds of millions in engineering investment. Your experiments and models directly impact revenue, user outcomes, and competitive strategy.

The Rothera JV creates a massive expansion in the analytical surface area Data Scientists must cover. As Robinhood becomes an "Information and Capital Markets Ecosystem," DS professionals must analyze cross-product user behavior, design experiments that span multiple verticals, and build models that leverage the full ecosystem's data. A pre-Rothera Data Scientist analyzed one product; a post-Rothera Data Scientist analyzes an interconnected ecosystem of six or more products. This expanded scope and the scarcity of DS professionals who can operate across regulated financial products create Ecosystem-Critical premiums of $20K-$35K above standard offers.

Robinhood's data is uniquely valuable because it captures the full financial life of retail investors — trading behavior, spending patterns (credit card), savings habits (cash management), retirement planning, and crypto activity. Data Scientists who can leverage this rich cross-vertical dataset to generate actionable insights have outsized impact and should price their compensation accordingly.

#### Rothera — The Ecosystem-Critical Premium

The mid-2026 Rothera Joint Venture transforms Robinhood from a commission-free trading application into an "Information and Capital Markets Ecosystem." For Data Scientists, this creates an unprecedented analytical challenge — and a corresponding compensation premium:

- **Ecosystem Analytics Specialists Command $20K-$35K Premiums:** Data Scientists who can design experiments and build models spanning multiple product verticals — analyzing how trading behavior predicts retirement savings patterns, how crypto activity influences Gold conversion, or how credit card spending correlates with investment decisions — are classified as ecosystem-critical. These cross-vertical analytical capabilities carry a $20K-$35K annual premium over standard IC3/IC4 offers.

- **Cross-Product Causal Inference Is the Scarcest DS Skill in Fintech:** Post-Rothera, Robinhood's experimentation platform must support experiments that measure cross-product effects — e.g., does a change in the crypto experience affect retirement account contributions? Data Scientists who can design and analyze these multi-product causal inference studies justify $280K-$312K TC at the IC4 level.

- **Gold Subscription Analytics Is Direct Revenue Work — Worth $15K-$25K in Bonus Leverage:** Data Scientists who own Gold conversion funnel analysis, subscriber retention modeling, and ARPU optimization have direct P&L impact on Robinhood's highest-margin revenue line (2.3M+ subscribers). Use this revenue proximity to negotiate performance bonuses of $15K-$25K tied to Gold metrics and sign-on bonuses of $25K-$40K.

- **Regulatory-Grade Statistical Analysis Carries Scarcity Premium of $10K-$20K:** Financial products must meet SEC and FINRA standards for suitability, disclosure, and fairness. Data Scientists who can produce regulatory-grade statistical analyses — demonstrating that products do not discriminate, that risk disclosures are adequate, and that user outcomes are measured rigorously — are exceptionally scarce. This compliance capability adds $10K-$20K to your negotiable range.

#### Global Levers

**1. Competing Data Science Offers from Fintech and Big Tech**
> "I have competing DS offers from [Coinbase IC4 at $335K TC / Google L5 DS at $348K TC / Meta DS at $342K TC]. I am drawn to Robinhood because the ecosystem analytics challenge — analyzing cross-product financial behavior at scale — is uniquely compelling. But I need the package to be competitive. Can we close the gap through RSU uplift and a performance bonus tied to Gold analytics?"

**2. Ecosystem Analytics Capability Framing**
> "My experience in [cross-product experimentation / multi-sided marketplace analytics / causal inference in regulated environments] at [Previous Company] maps directly to the ecosystem analytics Robinhood needs for Rothera. I would like to discuss an Ecosystem-Critical premium — I am proposing $285K+ TC with a Gold conversion performance bonus."

**3. Revenue-Proximate Analytics Track Record**
> "At [Previous Company], my analytical work directly drove $[X]M in revenue through [conversion optimization / pricing model improvements / retention analysis]. Robinhood Gold analytics is direct revenue work — I would like to discuss a performance bonus structure tied to Gold subscription metrics and ARPU growth."

**4. London Dual-Currency and Quantitative Finance Market**
> "For the London role, I need USD-denominated RSUs for comp parity with US data scientists. London's quantitative finance market offers strong alternatives — I am evaluating offers from Citadel, Two Sigma, and Revolut with total comp of £200K-£250K. Can Robinhood provide competitive London comp and a housing allowance?"

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $275K-$312K TC in Menlo Park or New York by combining a competing offer ($15K-$25K base lift), ecosystem analytics framing ($12K-$20K RSU uplift), a sign-on bonus ($25K-$40K), and a Gold conversion performance bonus ($15K-$25K). In London, target £210K-£236K / $275K-$312K by negotiating USD-denominated RSUs and a housing allowance of £10K-£16K. The strongest lever is a written Coinbase or Google DS offer — Robinhood's data science leadership actively matches top competitors for ecosystem-critical analytical hires. Do not accept below $245K TC in Menlo Park/New York or £185K / $240K TC in London without exhausting all levers.
