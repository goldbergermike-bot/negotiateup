### DevOps Engineer | xAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Outsize Sign-On | AGI Sprint Mission | $20B Funding (Jan 2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Sign-On | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------|------------|
| San Francisco | $205K–$255K | $288K–$502K | $35K–$68K | $307K–$418K |
| Palo Alto | $205K–$255K | $288K–$502K | $35K–$68K | $307K–$418K |
| Remote US | $192K–$242K | $288K–$502K | $28K–$58K | $290K–$400K |

**Negotiation DNA**

xAI DevOps Engineers operate the most extreme AI infrastructure on Earth — Colossus, the world's largest GPU supercomputer with 100K+ H100 GPUs, plus the inference infrastructure serving Grok to 500M+ X users. This is infrastructure engineering at a scale and urgency that doesn't exist anywhere else: you manage GPU clusters that cost billions, deploy model updates to hundreds of millions of users, and maintain uptime for the AGI sprint's most critical systems. The $20B funding means massive infrastructure expansion, and DevOps engineers are the ones who make new capacity operational. [Source: xAI DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** xAI DevOps Eng = Google L4 SRE = OpenAI Infra Eng = NVIDIA DevOps

**AGI Sprint — $20B Make-Whole Sign-On**

xAI raised $20B in January 2026 — the largest private AI funding round in history. "I operate Colossus — the world's largest GPU cluster — and the inference infrastructure serving 500M+ users. My infrastructure expertise is immediately critical to xAI's AGI sprint. I'm leaving unvested equity — a $62K sign-on makes me whole and puts me on Colossus infrastructure from Day 1. On $20B, this is an investment in infrastructure readiness." Push for $45K-$70K sign-ons for infra roles.

**Global Levers**

1. **Colossus Infrastructure Operations:** "I operate 100K+ H100 GPUs — the most extreme AI infrastructure on Earth. GPU cluster management at Colossus scale is a skillset that exists at maybe 5 companies worldwide."
2. **$20B Make-Whole Sign-On:** "I'm leaving unvested equity. xAI's $20B funds a $62K sign-on. My Colossus expertise is immediately deployable — the sign-on removes friction."
3. **$20B Infrastructure Expansion:** "The $20B funds massive GPU cluster expansion. I build the DevOps automation, deployment pipelines, and monitoring that make new capacity operational at unprecedented speed."
4. **Dual-Scale Infrastructure:** "I manage both training infrastructure (Colossus, 100K+ GPUs) and serving infrastructure (Grok, 500M+ users). This dual-scale challenge — batch and real-time — exists nowhere else."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $248K base, $492K equity over 4 years, and a $62K sign-on for this DevOps role. I operate Colossus — 100K+ H100 GPUs — and the inference infrastructure serving Grok to 500M+ users. xAI's $20B funds infrastructure expansion that I make operational. I'm leaving unvested equity. I have competing infra offers from [Google SRE at $345K TC / OpenAI at $365K TC]. xAI's infrastructure scale is unmatched." Accept at $228K+ base, $438K+ equity, and $48K+ sign-on.
