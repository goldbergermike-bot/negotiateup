### Senior Software Engineer | xAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Outsize Sign-On | AGI Sprint Mission | $20B Funding (Jan 2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Sign-On | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------|------------|
| San Francisco | $228K–$285K | $425K–$738K | $50K–$95K | $356K–$480K |
| Palo Alto | $228K–$285K | $425K–$738K | $50K–$95K | $356K–$480K |
| Remote US | $215K–$272K | $425K–$738K | $42K–$82K | $338K–$457K |

**Negotiation DNA**

xAI Senior Software Engineers own critical subsystems within the Grok platform and xAI infrastructure — from model serving and API gateway to training pipeline orchestration on Colossus, the world's largest GPU supercomputer. At this level, your architecture decisions shape how xAI scales toward AGI. The $20B January 2026 funding round gives xAI the capital to pay outsize sign-ons that make senior engineers whole for equity they leave behind at FAANG or other AI labs.

**Level Mapping:** xAI Senior SWE (L5) = Google L5 SWE = OpenAI Senior SWE = Meta E5

**AGI Sprint — $20B Make-Whole Sign-On**

xAI raised $20B in January 2026 — the largest private AI funding round in history. "At the senior level, I'm leaving $100K-$200K+ in unvested equity at [current company]. xAI's $20B raise means you have the capital for an outsize sign-on that makes me whole. I need a $85K sign-on — that's a rounding error on $20B, but it's the difference between me joining and staying at [company]. xAI is in an AGI sprint; the sign-on removes the financial friction that slows your hiring." Push for sign-ons 50-100% above standard.

**Global Levers**

1. **AGI Sprint Architecture:** "As a Senior SWE, I make architecture decisions that shape xAI's path to AGI. My technical choices on Colossus — the world's largest GPU cluster — directly accelerate or decelerate the AGI timeline."
2. **$20B Make-Whole Sign-On:** "I'm leaving $150K+ in unvested equity. xAI's $20B gives you the capital for an $85K sign-on that makes me whole. This is the fastest-growing AI company — remove the friction."
3. **Colossus-Scale Infrastructure:** "I build software on 100K+ H100 GPUs — the largest training cluster in the world. This scale of distributed systems engineering exists nowhere else."
4. **Grok Platform Ownership:** "Grok reaches 500M+ users through X. At the senior level, I own critical subsystems that directly impact the user experience for one of the largest AI deployments in the world."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $278K base, $722K equity over 4 years, and an $88K sign-on for this Senior SWE role. I'm leaving $155K in unvested equity at [company] to join xAI's AGI sprint — your $20B raise means you can make me whole. I make architecture decisions on Colossus, the world's largest GPU cluster. I have competing offers from [OpenAI Senior at $455K TC / Google L5 at $450K TC]. xAI's AGI mission and Colossus scale are unique, but the sign-on must make me whole and the equity must reflect senior-level impact." Accept at $255K+ base, $648K+ equity, and $72K+ sign-on.
