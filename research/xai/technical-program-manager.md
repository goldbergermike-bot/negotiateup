### Technical Program Manager | xAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Outsize Sign-On | AGI Sprint Mission | $20B Funding (Jan 2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Sign-On | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------|------------|
| San Francisco | $198K–$248K | $265K–$462K | $30K–$60K | $296K–$404K |
| Palo Alto | $198K–$248K | $265K–$462K | $30K–$60K | $296K–$404K |
| Remote US | $185K–$235K | $265K–$462K | $25K–$52K | $278K–$388K |

**Negotiation DNA**

xAI TPMs coordinate the most urgent program management in AI — Colossus GPU cluster expansion programs, Grok model release timelines, xAI API enterprise rollouts, and the infrastructure scaling that the $20B funding demands. At xAI, program management is the tempo of the AGI sprint: your coordination determines how fast new GPU capacity becomes operational, how quickly model improvements reach 500M+ users, and how efficiently $20B in capital converts into AGI progress.

**Level Mapping:** xAI TPM = Google L4-L5 TPM = OpenAI TPM = Meta IC4-IC5 TPM

**AGI Sprint — $20B Make-Whole Sign-On**

xAI raised $20B in January 2026 — the largest private AI funding round in history. "I coordinate the programs that deploy $20B in capital toward AGI. My program management determines how fast Colossus expands, how quickly Grok improves, and how efficiently xAI scales. I'm leaving unvested equity — a $55K sign-on makes me whole. The sign-on is trivial against the programs I'll manage." Push for $40K-$60K sign-ons at TPM level.

**Global Levers**

1. **AGI Sprint Program Tempo:** "I set the program tempo for the AGI sprint — coordinating Colossus expansion, Grok releases, and API launches. My program management directly determines how fast $20B in capital converts into AGI progress."
2. **$20B Make-Whole Sign-On:** "I'm leaving unvested equity. A $55K sign-on makes me whole and lets me start managing programs immediately. I coordinate the deployment of billions in capital."
3. **Colossus Expansion Programs:** "I manage the GPU cluster expansion programs — from procurement to deployment to operational readiness. Each expansion milestone accelerates xAI's AGI timeline."
4. **Cross-Org Sprint Coordination:** "I coordinate across research, engineering, infrastructure, and product teams running at sprint pace. This cross-functional urgency is unique to xAI's AGI mission."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $242K base, $452K equity over 4 years, and a $55K sign-on for this TPM role. I coordinate programs that deploy $20B in capital toward AGI — Colossus expansion, Grok releases, enterprise rollouts. The sign-on makes me whole. I have competing TPM offers from [Google at $340K TC / OpenAI at $352K TC]. xAI's program urgency and capital deployment scale are unique." Accept at $225K+ base, $402K+ equity, and $42K+ sign-on.
