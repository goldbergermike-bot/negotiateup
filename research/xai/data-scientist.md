### Data Scientist | xAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Outsize Sign-On | AGI Sprint Mission | $20B Funding (Jan 2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Sign-On | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------|------------|
| San Francisco | $208K–$258K | $305K–$532K | $35K–$68K | $312K–$425K |

**Negotiation DNA**

xAI Data Scientists analyze the most unique AI dataset in the world — real-time data from the X platform (500M+ users), Grok interaction data, model performance metrics, and Colossus training telemetry. The X platform provides a firehose of real-time human discourse, sentiment, and knowledge that no other AI lab can access. Your analyses inform model training decisions, product strategy, and the evaluation frameworks that measure Grok's capabilities on the path to AGI. [Source: xAI DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** xAI Data Scientist = Google L4 DS = OpenAI DS = Meta DS

**AGI Sprint — $20B Make-Whole Sign-On**

xAI raised $20B in January 2026 — the largest private AI funding round in history. "I analyze the X platform's real-time data firehose — a proprietary dataset no other AI lab has access to. My insights directly inform Grok's training and the AGI roadmap. I'm leaving unvested equity at [company] — a $62K sign-on makes me whole. xAI's $20B means the capital is there." Push for $45K-$70K sign-ons at DS level.

**Global Levers**

1. **X Platform Data Moat:** "I analyze real-time data from 500M+ X users — a proprietary data asset no other AI lab can access. My analyses inform model training decisions that directly accelerate xAI's AGI timeline."
2. **$20B Make-Whole Sign-On:** "I'm leaving unvested equity. xAI's $20B funds a $62K sign-on that makes me whole. My data insights have immediate impact on Grok's capabilities."
3. **AGI Evaluation Frameworks:** "I build the evaluation frameworks that measure Grok's capabilities on the path to AGI. My metrics determine whether xAI is making progress toward its ultimate mission."
4. **Colossus Training Analytics:** "I analyze telemetry from 100K+ H100 GPUs — the world's largest training cluster. My optimization insights save millions in compute costs and accelerate training cycles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $252K base, $522K equity over 4 years, and a $62K sign-on for this DS role. I analyze the X platform's proprietary data firehose — 500M+ users of real-time discourse that no other AI lab can access — plus Colossus training telemetry. The sign-on makes me whole for equity I'm leaving. I have competing DS offers from [OpenAI at $382K TC / Google at $355K TC]. xAI's data moat through X is unique." Accept at $235K+ base, $468K+ equity, and $48K+ sign-on.
