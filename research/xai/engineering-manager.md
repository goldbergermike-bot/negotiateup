**Negotiation DNA**

xAI Engineering Managers build and lead the teams on the fastest AGI sprint in the industry. You manage 8-15 engineers working on Grok features, Colossus infrastructure, model training pipelines, or the xAI API — recruiting and retaining talent against every AI lab and Big Tech company simultaneously. EM roles at xAI carry unique urgency: the $20B funding means the company is scaling engineering at unprecedented speed, and your ability to hire fast and build high-performing teams directly accelerates the AGI timeline.

**Level Mapping:** xAI EM = Google L5-L6 EM = OpenAI EM = Meta M1-M2

**AGI Sprint — $20B Make-Whole Sign-On**

xAI raised $20B in January 2026 — the largest private AI funding round in history. "As an Engineering Manager, I build the teams that execute the AGI sprint. My hiring velocity directly determines xAI's ability to staff Colossus and scale Grok. I'm leaving $200K+ in unvested equity — a $105K sign-on makes me whole and lets me start building your teams immediately. On $20B in funding, the sign-on is an investment in hiring velocity." Push for $80K-$120K sign-ons at EM level.

**Global Levers**

1. **AGI Sprint Team Building:** "I build the engineering teams executing the most aggressively funded AGI sprint in history. My hiring decisions and team scaling directly determine whether xAI hits its AGI milestones."
2. **$20B Make-Whole Sign-On:** "I'm leaving $200K+ in unvested equity. A $105K sign-on is an investment in hiring velocity — I start building your teams immediately instead of waiting for a notice period."
3. **Colossus-Scale Team Leadership:** "I manage teams operating on 100K+ H100 GPUs. The engineering management challenges at Colossus scale — distributed systems, GPU scheduling, fault tolerance — don't exist anywhere else."
4. **Hypergrowth Talent Competition:** "xAI competes for talent against OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta simultaneously. My ability to recruit, retain, and develop engineers in this hypercompetitive market is the highest-leverage EM skill in AI."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $322K base, $915K equity over 4 years, and a $108K sign-on for this EM role. I build the teams executing the AGI sprint at the world's most aggressively funded AI company. My hiring velocity on $20B in capital directly determines xAI's ability to scale. I'm leaving $210K in unvested equity. I have competing EM offers from [OpenAI at $540K TC / Google at $520K TC]. xAI's AGI mission is unique, but the sign-on must make me whole and the equity must reflect EM-level impact on team scaling." Accept at $295K+ base, $825K+ equity, and $88K+ sign-on.
