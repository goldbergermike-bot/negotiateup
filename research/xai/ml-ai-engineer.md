### ML/AI Engineer | xAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Outsize Sign-On | AGI Sprint Mission | $20B Funding (Jan 2026) | **+25–40% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Sign-On | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------|------------|
| San Francisco | $268K–$338K | $535K–$935K | $65K–$125K | $402K–$572K |
| Palo Alto | $268K–$338K | $535K–$935K | $65K–$125K | $402K–$572K |
| Remote US | $252K–$322K | $535K–$935K | $55K–$108K | $386K–$555K |

**Negotiation DNA**

xAI ML/AI Engineers are at the frontier of AGI research — training Grok on Colossus (100K+ H100 GPUs), the world's largest training cluster, with access to the X platform's proprietary data firehose. This is ML engineering with more compute, more data, and more urgency than any other lab: xAI's explicit mission is the fastest path to AGI, backed by $20B in fresh capital. The Agentic AI Premium (25-40%) applies for engineers building Grok's autonomous capabilities — tool use, code execution, multi-step reasoning, and real-world action-taking. ML/AI engineers at xAI command the largest sign-ons in the industry. [Source: xAI ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**AGI Sprint — $20B Make-Whole Sign-On**

xAI raised $20B in January 2026 — the largest private AI funding round in history. "I'm an ML engineer joining the fastest AGI sprint in the industry — training on the world's largest GPU cluster with proprietary X platform data. ML engineers are the most recruited talent in AI, and I'm leaving $200K-$400K+ in unvested equity. xAI's $20B makes a $115K sign-on trivial — it's the cost of adding an ML engineer who accelerates Grok's capabilities and the AGI timeline. The sign-on must make me whole, and the equity must reflect that I'm building AGI." Push for $80K-$125K sign-ons for ML roles — the highest in xAI.

**Global Levers**

1. **AGI on the World's Largest Cluster:** "I train Grok on Colossus — 100K+ H100 GPUs — with more compute than any other ML engineer in the world. This is the fastest path to AGI, and my models directly determine xAI's progress."
2. **$20B Make-Whole Sign-On — ML Premium:** "ML engineers are the scarcest talent in AI. I'm leaving $300K+ in unvested equity. A $115K sign-on is the cost of adding an ML engineer to the AGI sprint — trivial on $20B."
3. **Agentic AI Premium (25-40%):** "I build Grok's autonomous capabilities — tool use, code execution, multi-step reasoning. This is agentic AI at AGI scale, commanding a 25-40% premium over standard ML compensation."
4. **X Platform Data + Colossus Compute:** "No other ML engineer has access to both 500M+ users of real-time data (X platform) and 100K+ H100 GPUs (Colossus). This data + compute combination is the ultimate ML engineering environment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $332K base, $918K equity over 4 years, and a $115K sign-on for this ML/AI Engineer role with the 25-40% Agentic AI Premium. I train Grok on the world's largest GPU cluster with proprietary X platform data — the fastest path to AGI. ML engineers are the scarcest talent, and I'm leaving $300K+ in unvested equity. xAI's $20B makes the sign-on trivial. I have competing ML offers from [OpenAI at $560K TC / Anthropic at $525K TC with $335K base / Google at $520K TC]. xAI's compute advantage and AGI mission are unique, but sign-on and equity must be the highest in the industry for ML roles." Accept at $298K+ base, $828K+ equity, and $92K+ sign-on.
