**Negotiation DNA**

xAI Data Engineers build the data infrastructure powering the AGI sprint — training data pipelines from the X platform's real-time firehose (500M+ users), RLHF data systems, model evaluation datasets, and Colossus training telemetry pipelines. The X platform provides a proprietary data advantage no other AI lab has: real-time human discourse, sentiment, knowledge, and multimodal content at a scale that transforms model training. Your data engineering directly determines the quality and diversity of Grok's training data. [Source: xAI DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** xAI Data Eng = Google L4 DE = OpenAI DE = Meta DE

**AGI Sprint — $20B Make-Whole Sign-On**

xAI raised $20B in January 2026 — the largest private AI funding round in history. "I build the data pipelines that feed Grok's training — including the X platform's proprietary data firehose that no other AI lab can access. My data engineering directly determines model quality. I'm leaving unvested equity — a $55K sign-on makes me whole. On $20B, the sign-on is an investment in data infrastructure readiness." Push for $40K-$60K sign-ons for DE roles.

**Global Levers**

1. **X Platform Data Advantage:** "I build data pipelines from the X platform — 500M+ users of real-time discourse, sentiment, and knowledge. This proprietary data firehose gives xAI a training data advantage no other lab can access."
2. **$20B Make-Whole Sign-On:** "I'm leaving unvested equity. My data pipelines immediately improve Grok's training quality. A $55K sign-on makes me whole."
3. **Training Data = AGI Quality:** "The quality of training data is the single most important factor in AGI progress. My data engineering directly determines whether Grok is the most capable AI in the world."
4. **Colossus Telemetry at Scale:** "I build data pipelines for 100K+ H100 GPU telemetry — training metrics, utilization data, and optimization signals. This infrastructure analytics exists at no other scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $242K base, $458K equity over 4 years, and a $55K sign-on for this Data Engineer role. I build the data pipelines powering Grok's training — including the X platform's proprietary data firehose that no other AI lab can access. The sign-on makes me whole. I have competing DE offers from [OpenAI at $350K TC / Google at $335K TC]. xAI's X platform data advantage is unique." Accept at $222K+ base, $408K+ equity, and $42K+ sign-on.
