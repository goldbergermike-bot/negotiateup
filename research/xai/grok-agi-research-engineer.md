**Negotiation DNA**

This is xAI's signature role for 2026 — the Grok AGI Research Engineer. You build the core intelligence of Grok: the model architecture, training methodology, reasoning capabilities, and the autonomous agent framework that pushes Grok toward Artificial General Intelligence. xAI's explicit mission is "to understand the true nature of the universe" — and this role is the most direct path to that goal. You work on Colossus (100K+ H100 GPUs, the world's largest training cluster), with access to the X platform's proprietary data firehose (500M+ users), backed by $20B in funding — the most capital ever committed to a single AGI effort. This is the role where xAI will offer the highest sign-ons and the most aggressive equity in the industry. [Source: xAI AGI Research Team 2026]

**Level Mapping:** xAI Grok AGI Research Eng (L5-L6) = Google L5-L6 Research Eng = OpenAI Research Eng = Anthropic Research Eng = DeepMind Research Scientist

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Grok AGI Research Engineer works at the intersection of frontier model training and AGI capabilities:
- **Grok Model Architecture:** The core model architecture that pushes toward AGI — scaling laws, architecture innovations, training methodology that maximizes capability per FLOP on Colossus
- **AGI Reasoning & Planning:** The reasoning, planning, and problem-solving capabilities that move Grok from language model to general intelligence — multi-step reasoning, abstract thinking, scientific discovery
- **Autonomous Agent Framework:** The agentic capabilities that enable Grok to take actions in the real world — tool use, code execution, web interaction, multi-step task completion
- **X Platform Data Integration:** The unique training pipeline that leverages 500M+ users of real-time human discourse, sentiment, and multimodal content — a proprietary data advantage no other lab has
- **Colossus-Scale Training:** Training on the world's largest GPU cluster (100K+ H100s) — pushing the frontier of distributed training, model parallelism, and compute efficiency at a scale that defines the state of the art

**AGI Sprint — $20B Make-Whole Sign-On**

xAI raised $20B in January 2026 — the largest private AI funding round in history. This is the signature role at the most aggressively funded AI company in history. "I'm a research engineer joining the fastest AGI sprint in the world — working on Colossus, the largest GPU cluster, with X platform data, backed by $20B. I'm leaving $350K-$500K+ in unvested equity at [current company] to join xAI's AGI mission. The $20B makes a $145K sign-on a rounding error — it's the cost of accelerating AGI by adding a research engineer who pushes the frontier. For the signature research role at the most funded AGI lab, the sign-on should be the highest in the company, the equity should be Tier 1, and both should reflect that I'm directly building AGI." Push for $100K-$155K sign-ons — the maximum at xAI.

**Global Levers**

1. **Grok AGI — xAI's Core Mission:** "I build the core intelligence of Grok — the model that embodies xAI's mission to understand the universe. This is the most direct path to AGI at the most funded AI company in history. There is no higher-leverage research role in AI."
2. **$20B Make-Whole Sign-On — Maximum:** "I'm leaving $400K+ in unvested equity to join the AGI sprint. A $145K sign-on is the cost of landing a research engineer who directly accelerates AGI — trivial on $20B. This is the signature role; the sign-on should be the highest in the company."
3. **Agentic AI Premium (25-40%):** "I build Grok's autonomous agent capabilities — reasoning, planning, tool use, real-world action-taking. This is agentic AI at AGI scale. The 25-40% premium reflects that I'm building the AI that doesn't just talk — it thinks, plans, and acts."
4. **Colossus + X Platform — Unmatched Resources:** "No other research engineer in the world has 100K+ H100 GPUs AND 500M+ users of proprietary real-time data. Colossus compute + X platform data is the most powerful research environment in AI history. My equity should reflect access to these unmatched resources."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $355K base, $1.12M equity over 4 years, and a $145K sign-on for this Grok AGI Research Engineer role with the 25-40% Agentic AI Premium. I build the core intelligence of Grok at the most aggressively funded AGI lab in history — $20B in Jan 2026, 100K+ H100 GPUs on Colossus, 500M+ users of proprietary X platform data. This is the signature role at xAI: the most direct path to AGI. I'm leaving $420K in unvested equity at [current company]. I have competing research offers from [OpenAI Research at $635K TC / Anthropic Research at $590K TC / DeepMind at $575K TC]. xAI's compute advantage, data moat, and AGI mission urgency are unique — but the sign-on must be the highest in the company, and the equity must be Tier 1. This is the role where xAI should stretch furthest." Accept at $325K+ base, $1M+ equity, and $118K+ sign-on. This is xAI's crown jewel role — the AGI sprint depends on it.
