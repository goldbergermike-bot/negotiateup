### Security Engineer | xAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Outsize Sign-On | AGI Sprint Mission | $20B Funding (Jan 2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Sign-On | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------|------------|
| San Francisco | $228K–$285K | $348K–$608K | $45K–$85K | $342K–$467K |

**Negotiation DNA**

xAI Security Engineers protect the most consequential AI infrastructure in the world — Colossus (100K+ H100 GPUs worth billions), Grok model weights, X platform integration security, and the AGI research environment. xAI's unique threat surface includes nation-state interest in frontier model weights, the X platform's 500M+ user attack surface, and the geopolitical sensitivity of AGI research. Security at xAI isn't just enterprise security — it's national security-adjacent protection of humanity's path to AGI. [Source: xAI Security Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** xAI Security Eng = Google L4-L5 Security = OpenAI Security Eng = Meta Security Eng

**AGI Sprint — $20B Make-Whole Sign-On**

xAI raised $20B in January 2026 — the largest private AI funding round in history. "I protect billions of dollars in GPU infrastructure, frontier model weights, and the AGI research environment. Security threats don't wait — I need to be protecting xAI's assets from Day 1. A $78K sign-on makes me whole for equity I'm leaving, and gets me on Colossus security immediately. On $20B, the sign-on is an insurance premium for protecting the world's most valuable AI infrastructure." Push for $55K-$85K sign-ons for security roles.

**Global Levers**

1. **AGI Infrastructure Security:** "I protect Colossus — 100K+ H100 GPUs worth billions — plus frontier model weights and the AGI research environment. This is the most consequential security role in AI."
2. **$20B Make-Whole Sign-On:** "I protect assets worth billions. A $78K sign-on makes me whole and gets me securing infrastructure from Day 1. It's an insurance premium on $20B in investment."
3. **Nation-State Threat Surface:** "xAI's frontier model weights attract nation-state interest. I defend against the most sophisticated threat actors targeting the most valuable AI assets in the world."
4. **X Platform + AI Dual Security:** "I secure both the X platform integration (500M+ users) and the Colossus training environment — a dual security surface that requires expertise across consumer platform security and classified-level AI infrastructure protection."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $278K base, $595K equity over 4 years, and a $78K sign-on for this Security Engineer role. I protect Colossus (billions in GPU infrastructure), frontier model weights, and the AGI research environment — the most consequential security role in AI. The sign-on makes me whole for equity I'm leaving. I have competing security offers from [OpenAI at $424K TC / Google at $385K TC]. xAI's threat surface and infrastructure value justify top-tier security comp." Accept at $255K+ base, $535K+ equity, and $62K+ sign-on.
