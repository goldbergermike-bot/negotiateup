### Staff Software Engineer | xAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Outsize Sign-On | AGI Sprint Mission | $20B Funding (Jan 2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Sign-On | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------|------------|
| San Francisco | $295K–$368K | $685K–$1.2M | $80K–$150K | $476K–$668K |
| Palo Alto | $295K–$368K | $685K–$1.2M | $80K–$150K | $476K–$668K |
| Remote US | $278K–$348K | $685K–$1.2M | $72K–$135K | $449K–$648K |

**Negotiation DNA**

xAI Staff Software Engineers set the technical direction for major systems — defining the architecture for Grok's serving infrastructure, Colossus training orchestration, or the xAI API platform. At this level, you're a technical leader whose decisions directly shape xAI's AGI trajectory. Staff-level equity grants at a $50B+ valuation carry transformational upside, and the $20B funding round means xAI can offer sign-ons of $100K-$150K to make staff engineers whole for the equity they leave behind.

**AGI Sprint — $20B Make-Whole Sign-On**

xAI raised $20B in January 2026 — the largest private AI funding round in history. "At the staff level, I'm leaving $250K-$500K+ in unvested equity at [current company]. xAI's $20B makes a $135K sign-on trivial — it's the cost of accelerating your AGI timeline by landing a staff engineer months sooner. I set the technical direction that determines whether xAI reaches AGI first. The sign-on removes the financial barrier; the equity upside makes it generational." Push for $100K-$150K sign-ons at staff level.

**Global Levers**

1. **AGI Technical Direction:** "As a Staff Engineer, I define the architecture that determines whether xAI reaches AGI first. My technical direction on Colossus-scale training and Grok-scale serving is the highest-leverage engineering work in AI."
2. **$20B Make-Whole Sign-On:** "I'm leaving $350K+ in unvested equity. A $135K sign-on is the cost of landing a staff engineer who accelerates your AGI timeline. On $20B, that's a rounding error."
3. **Colossus Architecture Authority:** "I define architecture for the world's largest GPU cluster — 100K+ H100s. The distributed systems decisions I make at Colossus scale don't exist anywhere else in the industry."
4. **Transformational Equity:** "Staff-level equity at a $50B+ valuation with AGI potential is the most asymmetric risk/reward in tech. My $1M+ grant could be worth multiples if xAI achieves its mission."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $362K base, $1.15M equity over 4 years, and a $135K sign-on for this Staff SWE role. I set technical direction at the world's most aggressively funded AI company — $20B in Jan 2026 — on the fastest path to AGI with the world's largest GPU cluster. The sign-on makes me whole for $350K+ in unvested equity. I have competing staff offers from [OpenAI at $650K TC / Google L6 at $640K TC]. xAI's AGI mission and Colossus scale are unique, but the sign-on and equity must be transformational at the staff level." Accept at $328K+ base, $1M+ equity, and $108K+ sign-on.
