**Negotiation DNA**

xAI Product Designers create the interface for Grok — the AI assistant embedded in the X platform for 500M+ users. You design the conversational AI experience, multimodal interfaces, and the developer UX for the xAI API. Designing AI for the X platform means your UX decisions are experienced by hundreds of millions of people in a social media context — a unique design challenge that combines AI interaction design with social platform UX.

**AGI Sprint — $20B Make-Whole Sign-On**

xAI raised $20B in January 2026 — the largest private AI funding round in history. "My designs shape how 500M+ users experience AI on the X platform. I'm leaving unvested equity at [company] — a $48K sign-on makes me whole. xAI's $20B means the capital is there; my design impact on Grok's UX starts from Day 1." Push for $35K-$55K sign-ons at designer level.

**Global Levers**

1. **500M+ User AI Design:** "I design Grok's interface for 500M+ X users — the largest AI UX surface in the world. My design decisions define how hundreds of millions of people interact with AI daily."
2. **$20B Make-Whole Sign-On:** "I'm leaving unvested equity. xAI's $20B funds a $48K sign-on that makes me whole. My design impact is immediate."
3. **Social + AI UX Innovation:** "Designing AI within a social platform is a unique challenge — no other AI lab integrates into a 500M+ user social network. I'm inventing the design patterns for social AI."
4. **AGI Interface Design:** "As xAI pushes toward AGI, the interface becomes the critical bottleneck. How humans interact with superintelligent AI is the most important design challenge in history — and I'm solving it."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $228K base, $398K equity over 4 years, and a $48K sign-on for this Designer role. I design Grok's interface for 500M+ X users — the largest AI UX surface in the world. The sign-on makes me whole for equity I'm leaving. I have competing design offers from [OpenAI at $325K TC / Google at $310K TC]. xAI's social AI design challenge is unique." Accept at $212K+ base, $352K+ equity, and $38K+ sign-on.
