### Product Manager | Roblox Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Performance Bonus | Immersive 3D Platform & Creator Economy | 4D GenAI Foundation Model | **+40% AGENTIC PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo | $175K–$225K | $160K–$280K | 10–15% | $228K–$315K |
| New York | $170K–$220K | $155K–$270K | 10–15% | $220K–$305K |
| Remote US | $160K–$205K | $140K–$245K | 10–15% | $205K–$282K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox Product Managers define the product vision and roadmap for features that reach 80M+ DAU on the world's largest immersive platform, which has paid $1B+ to its creator community. You translate complex technical capabilities — real-time 3D rendering, physics simulation, social systems, and now the 4D GenAI foundation model — into product experiences that delight users and empower creators. Your product decisions directly shape Creator Economy 2.0, determining how AI-generated content is surfaced, monetized, and integrated into the creator workflow for 4M+ active developers. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because you are defining the product strategy for autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D experiences — your roadmap decisions determine the economic output of Roblox's agentic AI systems.

**Level Mapping:** Roblox Product Manager (IC3-IC5) = Google L5-L7 PM = Meta PM/SPM = Amazon PM/Sr. PM = Apple PM = Microsoft PM/Sr. PM

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As a Product Manager, you define how 4D GenAI capabilities are packaged into creator tools, player experiences, and platform features — deciding which AI generation capabilities to prioritize, how creators interact with AI co-creation workflows, and how AI-generated content is discovered, monetized, and governed at platform scale. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games PM GenAI roles ($230K-$320K TC), Meta 3D GenAI PM ($260K-$350K TC), Google DeepMind PM ($250K-$340K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium:** "I define the product strategy for the 4D foundation model — how autonomous AI agents are packaged into creator tools and user experiences that drive revenue. My product decisions shape the economic output of Roblox's agentic AI systems, and this strategic ownership justifies a 40% premium."
2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators. My product roadmap directly determines how AI amplifies creator output and monetization — every feature I prioritize impacts the growth trajectory of an economy that could scale to $10B+ in creator payouts."
3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "I'm defining products for 80M+ daily active users — every product decision I make impacts one of the world's largest platforms. PMs who can operate at this scale while navigating the AI/3D product space command premium compensation."
4. **AI Product Strategy & Monetization:** "Defining the product strategy for AI-generated content monetization is a nascent and high-value skill. My ability to design creator-AI workflows, content governance frameworks, and monetization models for autonomous AI output is directly tied to Roblox's future revenue growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $220K base and $260K RSUs over 4 years with the 40% Agentic Premium for this Product Manager position. I define the product strategy for 4D GenAI — how autonomous AI creation tools reach 80M+ DAU and power Creator Economy 2.0. I have competing offers from Meta PM at $330K TC and Google PM at $320K TC for AI platform product roles." Accept at $210K+ base and $230K+ RSUs.
