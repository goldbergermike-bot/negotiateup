### DevOps Engineer | Roblox Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Performance Bonus | Immersive 3D Platform & Creator Economy | 4D GenAI Foundation Model | **+40% AGENTIC PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo | $155K–$195K | $130K–$220K | 10–15% | $198K–$268K |
| New York | $150K–$190K | $125K–$210K | 10–15% | $190K–$258K |
| Remote US | $140K–$178K | $115K–$195K | 10–15% | $178K–$242K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox DevOps Engineers build and maintain the infrastructure that powers an 80M+ DAU immersive platform serving billions of real-time 3D interactions daily, with a creator economy that has paid $1B+ to developers. You own the CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, infrastructure-as-code, monitoring, and incident response systems that ensure 99.99% uptime for one of the world's most demanding real-time platforms. With the 4D GenAI foundation model, you are building the inference infrastructure, GPU cluster management, model deployment pipelines, and auto-scaling systems that enable AI agents to generate 3D content in real-time at global scale. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because you are building the production infrastructure that allows autonomous AI agents to reliably generate, deploy, and serve revenue-producing 3D experiences at scale.

**Level Mapping:** Roblox DevOps Engineer (IC2-IC5) = Google SRE L3-L6 = Meta Production Engineer = Amazon Systems Engineer = Apple SRE = Microsoft DevOps Engineer

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As a DevOps Engineer, you are building the production infrastructure that makes 4D GenAI operate at global scale — managing GPU clusters for model inference, building auto-scaling systems that handle bursty AI generation requests, deploying model updates with zero-downtime, and ensuring the AI generation pipeline maintains sub-second latency for 80M+ users worldwide. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games DevOps GenAI roles ($200K-$270K TC), Meta 3D GenAI Infra ($220K-$295K TC), Google DeepMind Infra ($215K-$285K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium:** "I build the production infrastructure for the 4D foundation model — GPU cluster management, inference scaling, and model deployment pipelines that enable autonomous AI agents to generate 3D content in real-time. This AI infrastructure ownership justifies a 40% premium."
2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators. My infrastructure work directly determines whether AI-generated content can be served reliably at scale — every creator using AI tools depends on the systems I build and maintain."
3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "I maintain infrastructure serving 80M+ daily active users with real-time latency requirements. DevOps engineers who can manage both traditional platform infrastructure and GPU-accelerated AI inference at this scale are exceptionally rare."
4. **AI Infrastructure & GPU Cluster Management:** "Managing GPU infrastructure for real-time AI inference in production is a specialized and high-demand skill. My ability to optimize GPU utilization, manage model serving infrastructure, and ensure AI system reliability directly enables Roblox's 4D GenAI initiative."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $190K base and $200K RSUs over 4 years with the 40% Agentic Premium for this DevOps Engineer position. I build and manage the AI inference infrastructure that enables the 4D GenAI model to generate 3D content in real-time for 80M+ DAU. I have competing offers from Meta Infra at $265K TC and Google SRE at $260K TC for AI infrastructure roles." Accept at $180K+ base and $185K+ RSUs.
