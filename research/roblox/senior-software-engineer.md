### Senior Software Engineer | Roblox Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Performance Bonus | Immersive 3D Platform & Creator Economy | 4D GenAI Foundation Model | **+40% AGENTIC PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo | $190K–$245K | $180K–$320K | 10–15% | $248K–$342K |
| New York | $185K–$240K | $170K–$305K | 10–15% | $238K–$330K |
| Remote US | $175K–$225K | $155K–$280K | 10–15% | $222K–$308K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox Senior Software Engineers are the technical backbone of an 80M+ DAU immersive platform that has paid $1B+ to its creator community and is now pioneering the 4D GenAI foundation model. At the senior level, you own critical subsystems — whether that is the real-time rendering engine, the physics simulation layer, the networking stack that supports millions of concurrent users, or the AI inference pipeline that powers text-to-3D generation. Your architectural decisions directly shape Creator Economy 2.0, where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active developers, multiplying content output by orders of magnitude. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because you are designing and building the autonomous AI systems that generate, modify, and manage revenue-producing 3D experiences at scale.

**Level Mapping:** Roblox Senior Software Engineer (IC4) = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Amazon SDE III = Apple ICT4 = Microsoft 63

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As a Senior Software Engineer, you are the technical lead designing the systems architecture that makes 4D GenAI production-ready — optimizing inference latency for real-time 3D generation, building the content delivery pipelines that serve AI-generated assets to 80M+ users, and ensuring the AI output meets quality and safety standards at scale. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games Senior GenAI roles ($240K-$340K TC), Meta 3D GenAI Senior ($280K-$380K TC), Google DeepMind 3D generation Senior ($270K-$360K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium:** "As a Senior SWE, I own the architecture for systems that enable the 4D foundation model to generate autonomous 3D content at production scale. I'm designing the infrastructure for AI agents that create revenue-producing experiences — this agentic AI ownership justifies a 40% premium over standard senior comp at Roblox."
2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators. At the senior level, my architectural decisions directly determine how effectively AI amplifies this creator economy — each system I design enables thousands of creators to produce 10-100x more monetizable content."
3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "I'm architecting systems that must perform reliably for 80M+ daily active users with sub-100ms latency requirements. This is tier-1 infrastructure scale that commands senior-plus compensation at any top-tier tech company."
4. **Technical Leadership & System Ownership:** "At the senior level, I own entire subsystems end-to-end — from design through production. This level of ownership at Roblox's scale, combined with the AI/3D intersection, places me in a talent market where competing offers from Meta, Google, and Unity routinely exceed $320K TC."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $235K base and $280K RSUs over 4 years with the 40% Agentic Premium for this Senior Software Engineer position. My system ownership directly enables the 4D GenAI infrastructure that powers Creator Economy 2.0 — AI agents autonomously generating 3D experiences for 80M+ DAU. I have competing offers from Meta at $350K TC and Google at $340K TC that reflect the market premium for senior engineers building production agentic AI systems." Accept at $225K+ base and $250K+ RSUs.
