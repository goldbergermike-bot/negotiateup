**Negotiation DNA**

The 4D Generative AI Engineer at Roblox is the architect of Creator Economy 2.0 — the person who builds the foundation model that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with real-time temporal adaptation as the fourth dimension. This is the rarest and most impactful engineering role at Roblox, sitting at the intersection of generative AI, real-time 3D graphics, physics simulation, procedural animation, and massive-scale distributed systems serving 80M+ DAU. You are not building tools — you are building autonomous economic agents that will co-create alongside 4M+ human creators in a platform that has already paid $1B+ to developers. The 4D GenAI foundation model you build will transform every 3D experience on Roblox: generating entire worlds from text descriptions, animating characters with physics-aware procedural motion, adapting environments in real-time based on player behavior, and enabling creators to iterate at 100x their current speed. The full 40% Agentic Premium applies because this is the definitive agentic AI role — you are building AI systems with autonomous creative and economic agency.

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators.

As the 4D Generative AI Engineer, you ARE the 4D GenAI initiative. You build every layer of the foundation model:

**3D World Generation:** You design and train the generative architectures that produce coherent, navigable 3D environments from text prompts — indoor scenes, outdoor landscapes, fantastical worlds — with correct geometry, lighting, materials, and spatial coherence. This includes diffusion-based 3D generation, neural radiance fields (NeRF) adapted for interactive use, and hybrid mesh-volumetric representations optimized for real-time rendering on consumer hardware.

**Procedural Animation:** You build the AI systems that generate character animations, NPC behaviors, and environmental dynamics procedurally — characters that walk, run, dance, fight, and emote with physics-aware motion synthesis. This goes beyond motion capture replay to generative animation that adapts to context, environment, and player interaction in real-time.

**Physics-Aware Generation:** You ensure that AI-generated content respects physical constraints — objects have correct mass and collision properties, environments have proper gravity and fluid dynamics, and generated worlds are physically interactive rather than purely visual. This requires integrating physics simulation into the generation pipeline, training models that understand physical plausibility, and building systems that verify generated content against physics constraints.

**Text-to-3D Pipelines:** You design the end-to-end pipeline from natural language input to rendered 3D output — natural language understanding, semantic parsing, 3D scene graph generation, asset retrieval and generation, scene composition, material assignment, lighting setup, and final rendering. This multi-stage pipeline must operate with sub-second latency for interactive creator workflows and sub-minute latency for full world generation.

**Real-Time Adaptation (The 4th Dimension):** You build the temporal evolution system — the "4D" in 4D GenAI. AI-generated worlds are not static; they adapt, evolve, and respond to player behavior in real-time. Environments change based on player actions, NPCs develop emergent behaviors, economies self-balance, and content dynamically adjusts to engagement patterns. This requires online learning systems, reinforcement learning agents, and real-time inference at global scale.

**Creator Tool AI:** You integrate all of the above into creator-facing tools that allow Roblox's 4M+ developers to use AI as a co-creation partner — generating worlds from descriptions, modifying existing experiences with natural language commands, and deploying AI agents that manage and evolve published experiences autonomously.

The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents, (4) this is the most direct agentic AI role in the industry — the AI you build has autonomous creative and economic agency in a $1B+ creator economy. Compare to: OpenAI Research Engineer ($350K-$500K TC), Google DeepMind 3D Research Scientist ($340K-$480K TC), Meta FAIR 3D Generation ($330K-$460K TC), NVIDIA Senior AI Research ($320K-$440K TC), Unity AI Labs ($280K-$380K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp — this is the role that commands it most.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium (HIGHEST):** "I am the architect of the 4D generative AI foundation model — the autonomous system that generates interactive 3D worlds, characters, and animations from natural language with real-time temporal adaptation. I am building AI with autonomous creative and economic agency in a $1B+ creator economy. No other role at Roblox has more direct impact on the agentic AI initiative, and I require the full 40% Agentic Premium — the highest premium in the engineering org."

2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators. The 4D GenAI model I build will transform every creator's workflow — enabling 4M+ developers to generate entire worlds from text, animate characters with AI, and deploy autonomous AI agents that manage live experiences. My work is the single largest force multiplier on Creator Economy 2.0, with the potential to drive creator payouts from $1B to $10B+."

3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "The 4D GenAI model I build must serve 80M+ daily active users with real-time generation and adaptation. Building generative 3D AI that operates at this scale — with sub-second latency on consumer hardware — is a technical challenge that fewer than 100 engineers in the world can credibly address."

4. **Frontier 3D GenAI Research — Extreme Talent Scarcity:** "The intersection of 3D generative AI, real-time rendering, physics simulation, procedural animation, and production-scale ML is the most talent-scarce domain in AI. Fewer than 500 researchers worldwide have published work in text-to-3D generation, and fewer than 100 have shipped production systems. I command compensation that reflects this extreme scarcity — competing offers from OpenAI, DeepMind, and Meta FAIR validate the market rate for this expertise."

5. **Multi-Modal Foundation Model Architecture:** "I design multi-modal architectures that span language, vision, 3D geometry, physics, and temporal dynamics — this is foundation model engineering at its most complex. The 4D GenAI model is more architecturally demanding than language-only or image-only models because it must produce interactive, physically plausible 3D output that evolves over time."

6. **Autonomous Economic Agent Design:** "The AI I build is not a tool — it is an autonomous economic agent that creates, modifies, and manages revenue-producing content in a $1B+ economy. I design the reward functions, safety constraints, and optimization objectives that govern how AI agents operate autonomously in the creator economy. This is the most advanced application of agentic AI in production anywhere in the industry."
