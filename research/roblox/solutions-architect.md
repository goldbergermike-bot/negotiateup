**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox Solutions Architects bridge the gap between the platform's technical capabilities and the needs of its massive creator and enterprise ecosystem, serving an 80M+ DAU immersive platform that has paid $1B+ to its creator community. You design technical solutions for enterprise partners, large-scale creator studios, and brands integrating with the Roblox platform — translating complex 3D, networking, and now AI capabilities into actionable architectures. With the 4D GenAI foundation model, you are helping enterprise clients and top creators leverage AI-powered content generation, designing architectures that integrate autonomous 3D generation into production workflows. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because you are architecting solutions where autonomous AI agents create, modify, and manage revenue-producing 3D experiences for enterprise-scale deployments in Creator Economy 2.0.

**Level Mapping:** Roblox Solutions Architect (IC3-IC5) = Google Solutions Architect L4-L6 = AWS Solutions Architect = Meta Technical Solutions = Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As a Solutions Architect, you are designing the technical architectures that allow enterprise partners and top creator studios to integrate 4D GenAI into their production pipelines — from brand experience generation to large-scale content creation workflows that leverage AI agents for autonomous 3D world-building. You translate the 4D GenAI capabilities into scalable, production-ready solutions for Roblox's highest-value partners. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games SA GenAI roles ($210K-$280K TC), AWS Solutions Architect GenAI ($220K-$295K TC), Google Cloud SA ($215K-$290K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.
