**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox Engineering Managers lead the teams building the foundational systems behind an 80M+ DAU immersive platform that has paid $1B+ to its creator community. You are responsible for hiring, growing, and directing engineering teams that ship production systems at massive scale — whether that is the real-time 3D engine, the platform infrastructure, the AI/ML systems, or the creator tools. With the 4D GenAI foundation model, you are leading teams that build autonomous AI agents capable of generating, modifying, and managing interactive 3D content, directly powering Creator Economy 2.0 where 4M+ creators are augmented by AI. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because you are building and leading the teams that create autonomous AI systems with direct economic output — your organizational decisions determine whether Roblox's agentic AI initiative succeeds.

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As an Engineering Manager, you lead the teams responsible for turning the 4D GenAI vision into production reality — hiring world-class AI/3D engineers, setting technical priorities across the GenAI stack, removing organizational blockers, and ensuring your teams ship autonomous content generation systems that meet quality, safety, and scale requirements for 80M+ users. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games EM GenAI roles ($300K-$420K TC), Meta 3D GenAI EM ($320K-$440K TC), Google DeepMind EM ($310K-$430K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium:** "I lead the engineering teams building the 4D foundation model — autonomous AI agents that generate revenue-producing 3D experiences. Managing teams at the intersection of agentic AI and real-time 3D is an extraordinarily rare leadership skill, and this justifies a 40% premium over standard EM comp."
2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators. My teams' output directly determines whether AI can reliably augment 4M+ creators — every hiring decision, technical priority, and organizational choice I make impacts the trajectory of Creator Economy 2.0."
3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "I'm leading teams responsible for systems serving 80M+ daily active users. Engineering management at this scale, combined with the AI/3D domain, requires a leadership profile that commands premium compensation in today's market."
4. **Talent Acquisition & Retention in AI/3D:** "Building teams at the intersection of generative AI and real-time 3D requires competing for talent against Google DeepMind, Meta Reality Labs, and OpenAI. My ability to attract, hire, and retain this talent directly enables Roblox's 4D GenAI initiative and justifies leadership-premium comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $270K base and $360K RSUs over 4 years with the 40% Agentic Premium for this Engineering Manager position. I lead the teams building the 4D GenAI autonomous content generation systems that power Creator Economy 2.0 across 80M+ DAU. I have competing offers from Meta EM at $420K TC and Google EM at $410K TC for GenAI team leadership roles." Accept at $255K+ base and $320K+ RSUs.
