**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox Product Designers craft the user experiences for an 80M+ DAU immersive platform that has paid $1B+ to its creator community. You design the interfaces, interactions, and workflows through which millions of users play, create, and connect — from the main platform experience to the creator studio tools. With the 4D GenAI foundation model, you are designing entirely new interaction paradigms: how users prompt AI to generate 3D worlds, how creators collaborate with AI agents, and how AI-generated content is presented, curated, and governed. Your design work directly enables Creator Economy 2.0 by making AI-powered creation accessible to 4M+ developers. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because you are designing the interfaces through which autonomous AI agents interact with humans to create revenue-producing 3D experiences.

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As a Product Designer, you are inventing the interaction paradigms for human-AI co-creation in 3D — designing how creators prompt, guide, refine, and collaborate with AI agents that generate worlds, characters, and animations in real-time. This is an entirely new design space with no established patterns, requiring you to define the UX for agentic AI in 3D creation from the ground up. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games Design GenAI roles ($185K-$250K TC), Meta 3D GenAI Design ($200K-$275K TC), Google DeepMind Design ($195K-$260K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium:** "I'm designing the interaction paradigms for human-AI co-creation — how creators work with autonomous AI agents to generate 3D experiences. This is an entirely new design space with no established UX patterns, and my work defining these agentic AI interactions justifies a 40% premium."
2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators. My design work determines whether AI-powered creation tools are accessible and effective for 4M+ creators — the quality of my UX directly impacts creator adoption and output in Creator Economy 2.0."
3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "I'm designing for 80M+ daily active users across every device and form factor. Designers who can craft experiences at this scale while pioneering new AI-3D interaction paradigms are exceptionally rare in the market."
4. **3D/Spatial Design & AI Interaction Design:** "The intersection of 3D spatial design, AI interaction design, and creator tool UX is an emerging discipline with very few experienced practitioners. My combined expertise in these areas places me in a premium talent category that commands above-market compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $175K base and $190K RSUs over 4 years with the 40% Agentic Premium for this Product Designer position. I'm defining the UX paradigms for 4D GenAI human-AI co-creation tools that will reach 80M+ DAU and power Creator Economy 2.0. I have competing offers from Meta Design at $245K TC and Google UX at $240K TC for AI-focused design roles." Accept at $165K+ base and $170K+ RSUs.
