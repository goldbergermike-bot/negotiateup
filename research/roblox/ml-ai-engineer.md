**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Performance Bonus | Immersive 3D Platform & Creator Economy | 4D GenAI Foundation Model | **+40% AGENTIC PREMIUM** | **+25-40% Agentic AI Premium Note**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp | w/ Agentic Premium |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| San Mateo | $195K–$255K | $200K–$340K | 10–15% | $258K–$358K | $322K–$501K (+25-40%) |
| New York | $190K–$250K | $190K–$325K | 10–15% | $248K–$348K | $310K–$487K (+25-40%) |

> **Agentic AI Premium Note:** ML/AI Engineers at Roblox working on the 4D GenAI foundation model should negotiate a +25-40% Agentic AI Premium above standard ML/AI comp, reflecting the autonomous, revenue-generating nature of the AI systems they build. The ranges above show both standard and premium-adjusted total compensation.

**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox ML/AI Engineers are at the epicenter of the company's most transformative initiative — the 4D GenAI foundation model that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with real-time temporal adaptation as the fourth dimension. You build the machine learning systems powering an 80M+ DAU immersive platform that has paid $1B+ to its creator community. Your work spans 3D generative models, reinforcement learning for agent behavior, recommendation systems, content moderation ML, natural language understanding, and computer vision — all operating at a scale that few AI teams in the world can match. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because you are directly building the autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage revenue-producing 3D experiences, transforming Creator Economy 2.0 from concept to production reality.

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As an ML/AI Engineer, you are the core builder of the 4D GenAI model itself — training the generative models that produce 3D geometry, textures, and animations; building the reinforcement learning systems that enable AI agents to adapt content in real-time; designing the multi-modal architectures that translate natural language to interactive 3D worlds; and optimizing inference for sub-second generation on consumer hardware. You are building the AI brain that powers Creator Economy 2.0. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games ML GenAI roles ($270K-$370K TC), Meta 3D GenAI ML ($300K-$420K TC), Google DeepMind 3D generation ($290K-$400K TC), OpenAI Research Engineer ($320K-$450K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium:** "I build the 4D generative AI model itself — the autonomous system that generates revenue-producing 3D experiences from natural language. I am directly creating the agentic AI capability that will define Roblox's next decade of growth, and this justifies a 40% premium over standard ML comp."
2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators. The AI models I build will enable 4M+ creators to produce 10-100x more content — each improvement in generation quality directly translates to exponential growth in creator economy revenue."
3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "My models serve 80M+ daily active users, requiring production ML at a scale that very few AI teams in the world operate. ML engineers who can build generative 3D AI at this scale are among the rarest talent in the industry."
4. **3D Generative AI Research Frontier:** "3D generative AI is the frontier of ML research, with fewer than 1,000 researchers worldwide who can build production-quality text-to-3D systems. My expertise at this intersection of generative AI, 3D graphics, and production ML commands premium compensation that reflects extreme talent scarcity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $250K base and $320K RSUs over 4 years with the full 40% Agentic Premium for this ML/AI Engineer position. I build the core 4D GenAI foundation model — the autonomous AI system that generates interactive 3D experiences from natural language for 80M+ DAU, directly powering Creator Economy 2.0. I have competing offers from OpenAI at $420K TC, Google DeepMind at $400K TC, and Meta FAIR at $390K TC for 3D generative AI roles." Accept at $240K+ base and $300K+ RSUs.
