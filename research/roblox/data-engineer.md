**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox Data Engineers build the data infrastructure powering analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence across an 80M+ DAU immersive platform that has paid $1B+ to its creator community. You design and operate the data pipelines, data lakes, streaming systems, and ETL frameworks that process billions of events daily — player interactions, creator analytics, economic transactions, and now AI-generated content telemetry. With the 4D GenAI foundation model, you are building the training data pipelines that feed 3D generation models, the feature stores that power real-time AI inference, and the data infrastructure that enables Creator Economy 2.0 to be measured, optimized, and scaled. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because you are building the data foundation that enables autonomous AI agents to learn, generate, and optimize revenue-producing 3D content.

**Level Mapping:** Roblox Data Engineer (IC2-IC5) = Google Data Engineer L3-L6 = Meta Data Engineer = Amazon Data Engineer = Apple Data Engineer = Microsoft Data Engineer

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As a Data Engineer, you build the data infrastructure backbone of 4D GenAI — the training data pipelines that curate and process millions of 3D assets for model training, the feature stores that power real-time AI inference decisions, the streaming systems that capture AI generation telemetry, and the data quality frameworks that ensure the AI model trains on clean, representative data. Without your data infrastructure, the 4D GenAI model cannot learn, generate, or improve. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games DE GenAI roles ($200K-$270K TC), Meta 3D GenAI DE ($215K-$290K TC), Google DeepMind DE ($210K-$285K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium:** "I build the training data pipelines and feature stores that power the 4D foundation model — without my data infrastructure, autonomous AI agents cannot learn to generate 3D content. This foundational role in enabling agentic AI justifies a 40% premium."
2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators. My data pipelines capture and process the creator economy analytics that drive business decisions — and now power the AI models that will amplify creator output 10-100x in Creator Economy 2.0."
3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "I process data from 80M+ daily active users — billions of events daily across 3D environments. Data engineers who can build pipelines at this scale while handling the unique challenges of 3D/spatial data and AI training data are rare."
4. **3D Data & AI Training Pipeline Expertise:** "Building data pipelines for 3D asset processing, spatial data, and AI model training is a specialized domain. My ability to design systems that curate, process, and serve 3D training data at scale directly enables Roblox's GenAI competitive advantage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $190K base and $200K RSUs over 4 years with the 40% Agentic Premium for this Data Engineer position. I build the training data pipelines and feature stores that power the 4D GenAI model's ability to autonomously generate 3D content for 80M+ DAU. I have competing offers from Meta DE at $265K TC and Google DE at $260K TC for AI data infrastructure roles." Accept at $180K+ base and $185K+ RSUs.
