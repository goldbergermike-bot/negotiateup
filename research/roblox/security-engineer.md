### Security Engineer | Roblox Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Performance Bonus | Immersive 3D Platform & Creator Economy | 4D GenAI Foundation Model | **+40% AGENTIC PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo | $170K–$220K | $160K–$260K | 10–15% | $222K–$302K |
| New York | $165K–$215K | $155K–$250K | 10–15% | $215K–$292K |
| Remote US | $155K–$200K | $140K–$230K | 10–15% | $200K–$272K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox Security Engineers protect an 80M+ DAU immersive platform that serves a predominantly young user base and has paid $1B+ to its creator community. The security stakes at Roblox are uniquely high — you safeguard children's data, protect the creator economy from fraud and exploitation, secure real-time 3D communication channels, and ensure platform trust at global scale. With the 4D GenAI foundation model, your role expands to securing AI-generated content pipelines, preventing adversarial attacks on generative models, ensuring AI safety and content moderation for autonomously generated 3D worlds, and protecting Creator Economy 2.0 from AI-enabled threats. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because you are securing the autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage revenue-producing 3D experiences — a failure in AI security directly translates to economic and reputational harm.

**Level Mapping:** Roblox Security Engineer (IC2-IC5) = Google Security Engineer L3-L6 = Meta Security Engineer = Amazon Security Engineer = Apple Security Engineer = Microsoft Security Engineer

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As a Security Engineer, you are the guardian of 4D GenAI — securing the AI generation pipeline against adversarial attacks, prompt injection, and content manipulation; building AI safety systems that prevent the generation of harmful 3D content; protecting the model weights and training data; and ensuring that autonomous AI agents operate within safety boundaries while generating content for a platform with millions of minors. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games Security GenAI roles ($225K-$305K TC), Meta 3D GenAI Security ($240K-$320K TC), Google DeepMind Security ($235K-$315K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium:** "I secure the 4D foundation model against adversarial attacks, content manipulation, and AI safety failures — protecting autonomous AI agents that generate content for millions of minors. AI security at this scale and sensitivity justifies a 40% premium."
2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators. My security work protects the economic integrity of Creator Economy 2.0 — preventing fraud, content theft, and AI-enabled exploitation that could undermine the trust 4M+ creators place in the platform."
3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "I secure a platform serving 80M+ daily active users, many of whom are minors. Security engineers who can protect both traditional platform infrastructure and AI generation pipelines at this scale, with this level of child safety requirements, are extremely rare."
4. **AI Safety & Child Protection Intersection:** "The intersection of AI safety, adversarial ML security, and child protection is an emerging and critical discipline. My ability to secure autonomous AI content generation while maintaining regulatory compliance (COPPA, GDPR-K) places me in a premium talent market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $215K base and $240K RSUs over 4 years with the 40% Agentic Premium for this Security Engineer position. I secure the 4D GenAI model and autonomous content generation pipeline against adversarial attacks and AI safety failures, protecting 80M+ DAU including millions of minors. I have competing offers from Meta Security at $300K TC and Google Security at $295K TC for AI security roles." Accept at $205K+ base and $220K+ RSUs.
