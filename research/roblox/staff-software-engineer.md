### Staff Software Engineer | Roblox Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Performance Bonus | Immersive 3D Platform & Creator Economy | 4D GenAI Foundation Model | **+40% AGENTIC PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo | $240K–$310K | $280K–$500K | 10–15% | $328K–$455K |
| New York | $235K–$305K | $265K–$480K | 10–15% | $318K–$440K |
| Remote US | $220K–$285K | $240K–$440K | 10–15% | $298K–$410K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox Staff Software Engineers set the technical direction for entire engineering domains across an 80M+ DAU immersive platform that has paid $1B+ to its creator community. At the staff level, you define the multi-year technical roadmap for critical platform capabilities — whether that is the real-time 3D engine, the distributed computing infrastructure, the AI/ML platform, or the creator tooling ecosystem. Your decisions directly determine whether the 4D GenAI foundation model can generate interactive 3D worlds at production quality and scale, enabling Creator Economy 2.0 where AI agents and 4M+ human creators co-build experiences. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because you are the technical visionary designing the autonomous AI systems that will fundamentally transform how 3D content is created, monetized, and evolved in real-time.

**Level Mapping:** Roblox Staff Software Engineer (IC5) = Google L6 = Meta E6 = Amazon Principal SDE = Apple ICT5 = Microsoft 65-66

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As a Staff Software Engineer, you are the technical visionary setting the architectural direction for 4D GenAI at Roblox — defining how AI-generated 3D content integrates with the existing platform, establishing the technical standards for autonomous content generation, and solving the hardest unsolved problems at the intersection of real-time 3D, generative AI, and massive-scale distributed systems. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games Staff GenAI roles ($340K-$460K TC), Meta 3D GenAI Staff ($380K-$520K TC), Google DeepMind 3D generation Staff ($370K-$500K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium:** "As a Staff Engineer, I define the multi-year technical direction for 4D GenAI — the autonomous AI system that generates revenue-producing 3D experiences. I'm architecting the agentic AI platform that will fundamentally transform Roblox's creator economy, and this level of technical leadership on an agentic AI initiative justifies a 40% premium."
2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators. At the staff level, my technical direction determines whether Creator Economy 2.0 succeeds — whether AI can reliably augment 4M+ creators to produce 10-100x more monetizable content, potentially driving creator payouts to $10B+."
3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "I'm setting technical direction for systems serving 80M+ daily active users. Staff-level engineers who can architect both AI/ML systems and real-time 3D platforms at this scale are exceptionally rare — the talent pool is measured in hundreds globally."
4. **Cross-Organizational Technical Influence:** "At staff level, I drive technical alignment across multiple teams and domains. My influence multiplies engineering output across the organization — this force-multiplier effect on Roblox's most critical initiative (4D GenAI) commands top-of-band compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $300K base and $440K RSUs over 4 years with the 40% Agentic Premium for this Staff Software Engineer position. I'm setting the technical direction for 4D GenAI — the autonomous AI platform that will transform Creator Economy 2.0 and drive exponential growth across 80M+ DAU. I have competing offers from Google at $480K TC and Meta at $500K TC for staff-level GenAI roles, both of which reflect the extreme scarcity of engineers who can architect agentic AI systems at 3D platform scale." Accept at $280K+ base and $400K+ RSUs.
