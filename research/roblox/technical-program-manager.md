### Technical Program Manager | Roblox Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Performance Bonus | Immersive 3D Platform & Creator Economy | 4D GenAI Foundation Model | **+40% AGENTIC PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo | $150K–$195K | $135K–$220K | 10–15% | $195K–$268K |
| New York | $145K–$190K | $130K–$210K | 10–15% | $188K–$258K |
| Remote US | $138K–$178K | $118K–$195K | 10–15% | $175K–$242K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox Technical Program Managers orchestrate the delivery of complex, cross-functional technical programs across an 80M+ DAU immersive platform that has paid $1B+ to its creator community. You drive alignment across engineering, product, design, data, and infrastructure teams to deliver large-scale platform capabilities on time and at quality — from real-time 3D engine upgrades to creator tool launches to AI platform rollouts. With the 4D GenAI foundation model, you are coordinating the most ambitious technical program in Roblox's history — the integration of autonomous AI generation into every layer of the platform, enabling Creator Economy 2.0. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because you are driving the program execution for autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage revenue-producing 3D experiences at scale.

**Level Mapping:** Roblox Technical Program Manager (IC3-IC5) = Google TPM L4-L6 = Meta TPM = Amazon TPM = Apple TPM = Microsoft TPM

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As a Technical Program Manager, you are the execution backbone of the 4D GenAI initiative — coordinating across ML research, 3D engineering, platform infrastructure, safety/trust, product, and design teams to deliver autonomous AI creation capabilities on schedule and at quality. You manage the dependencies, risks, milestones, and stakeholder alignment for a program that touches every part of the Roblox stack and serves 80M+ users. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games TPM GenAI roles ($200K-$270K TC), Meta 3D GenAI TPM ($215K-$290K TC), Google DeepMind TPM ($210K-$285K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium:** "I drive the program execution for the 4D foundation model — coordinating across 10+ teams to deliver autonomous AI agents that generate revenue-producing 3D content. Managing a cross-functional AI program of this complexity and business impact justifies a 40% premium."
2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators. My program management directly determines the pace at which AI creation tools reach 4M+ creators — every milestone I drive brings Creator Economy 2.0 closer to exponential growth."
3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "I manage technical programs that impact 80M+ daily active users. TPMs who can navigate the intersection of AI/ML, real-time 3D, and platform-scale infrastructure programs are in high demand and short supply."
4. **Cross-Functional AI Program Complexity:** "Coordinating the 4D GenAI program requires managing dependencies across ML research, 3D engineering, safety, product, and infrastructure — this is the most complex type of technical program in the industry, involving novel AI capabilities with production reliability requirements."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $190K base and $200K RSUs over 4 years with the 40% Agentic Premium for this Technical Program Manager position. I drive the cross-functional execution of the 4D GenAI program — coordinating the delivery of autonomous AI creation tools that will transform Creator Economy 2.0 for 80M+ DAU. I have competing offers from Meta TPM at $265K TC and Google TPM at $260K TC for AI program management roles." Accept at $180K+ base and $185K+ RSUs.
