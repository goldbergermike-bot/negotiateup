**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox Data Scientists unlock insights from one of the richest behavioral datasets in technology — 80M+ DAU generating billions of interactions daily across an immersive 3D platform that has paid $1B+ to its creator community. You analyze player behavior, creator economics, content engagement, and platform health at a scale that few companies can match. With the 4D GenAI foundation model, your work extends to evaluating AI-generated content quality, measuring the economic impact of AI-augmented creation, training reward models for 3D generation, and quantifying how Creator Economy 2.0 drives platform growth. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because you are building the data systems and models that enable autonomous AI agents to generate, evaluate, and optimize revenue-producing 3D experiences.

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As a Data Scientist, you are the analytical engine behind 4D GenAI — building the evaluation frameworks that measure AI-generated content quality, designing the reward signals that guide 3D generation models, analyzing the economic impact of AI-augmented creation on the creator economy, and building causal inference models that quantify how AI tools drive engagement and revenue across 80M+ users. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games DS GenAI roles ($210K-$290K TC), Meta 3D GenAI DS ($230K-$310K TC), Google DeepMind DS ($225K-$305K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium:** "I build the evaluation and reward systems that guide the 4D foundation model — my analytical frameworks determine whether autonomous AI agents generate high-quality, revenue-producing 3D content. This direct influence on agentic AI output quality justifies a 40% premium."
2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators. My data science work quantifies and optimizes how AI amplifies creator output and monetization — my causal models directly inform which AI features drive the most economic value in Creator Economy 2.0."
3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "I analyze behavioral data from 80M+ daily active users — billions of interactions daily across 3D environments. Data scientists who can derive insights from immersive 3D behavioral data at this scale are rare and command premium compensation."
4. **AI Evaluation & Reward Modeling for 3D:** "Building evaluation frameworks and reward models for AI-generated 3D content is an emerging specialty. My ability to define quality metrics, design human evaluation protocols, and build automated quality systems for 3D generation places me in a premium talent category."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $205K base and $220K RSUs over 4 years with the 40% Agentic Premium for this Data Scientist position. I build the evaluation and reward frameworks that guide the 4D GenAI model's autonomous content generation across 80M+ DAU, directly shaping Creator Economy 2.0 economics. I have competing offers from Meta DS at $290K TC and Google DS at $280K TC for AI evaluation roles." Accept at $195K+ base and $200K+ RSUs.
