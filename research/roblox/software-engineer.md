| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo | $145K–$185K | $120K–$200K | 10–15% | $185K–$252K |
| New York | $140K–$180K | $115K–$190K | 10–15% | $178K–$242K |
| Remote US | $130K–$170K | $100K–$175K | 10–15% | $165K–$225K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Roblox Software Engineers build the foundational systems powering an 80M+ DAU immersive platform that has paid $1B+ to its creator community. At this level, you are writing the code that underpins the 4D GenAI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with real-time adaptation as the fourth dimension. Your engineering work directly enables Creator Economy 2.0, where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators, producing 10-100x more content and driving exponential platform growth. The 40% Agentic Premium applies because the systems you build create autonomous AI agents that generate revenue-producing 3D experiences — not just tools, but economic agents with direct output.

**Level Mapping:** Roblox Software Engineer (IC2-IC3) = Google L3-L4 = Meta E3-E4 = Amazon SDE I-II = Apple ICT2-ICT3

**4D Generative AI — Creator Economy 2.0**

Roblox is building a 4D Generative AI foundation model — an AI system that generates fully interactive 3D worlds, objects, characters, and animations from natural language prompts, with the fourth dimension being real-time adaptation and temporal evolution. This transforms Roblox from a platform where humans build experiences to one where AI agents co-create alongside 4M+ active creators. As a Software Engineer, you are building the core infrastructure that makes 4D GenAI possible — the rendering pipelines, physics engines, networking layers, and API surfaces that allow AI-generated content to be served to 80M+ daily users in real-time. The 40% Agentic Premium is justified because: (1) You are building autonomous AI agents that create, modify, and manage 3D content — this is agentic AI with direct economic output, (2) Creator Economy 2.0 means AI-augmented creators produce 10-100x more content, driving platform growth exponentially, (3) the 40% Agentic Premium reflects the fact that you're building AI systems that autonomously generate revenue-producing content — not just tools, but economic agents. Compare to: Unity/Epic Games GenAI roles ($170K-$240K TC), Meta 3D GenAI ($200K-$280K TC), Google DeepMind 3D generation ($195K-$270K TC). Push for the full 40% Agentic Premium above standard Roblox comp.

**Global Levers**

1. **4D GenAI — 40% Agentic Premium:** "My engineering work directly enables the 4D foundation model that generates autonomous 3D content. I'm building the infrastructure for AI agents that create revenue-producing experiences — this agentic AI capability justifies a 40% premium over standard SWE comp at Roblox."
2. **Creator Economy 2.0 — $1B+ Creator Payouts:** "Roblox has paid $1B+ to creators, and the code I write amplifies this economy by enabling AI-assisted creation tools that let every creator produce 10-100x more content, directly driving platform revenue growth."
3. **80M+ DAU Platform Scale:** "I'm building systems that serve 80M+ daily active users across every device category — this is infrastructure scale that only a handful of platforms in the world demand, and my experience operating at this scale commands premium compensation."
4. **Real-Time 3D Systems Expertise:** "The intersection of real-time 3D rendering, physics simulation, and AI-generated content is an extremely rare skill set. Engineers who can build production systems at this intersection are in high demand at Unity, Epic, Meta, and Google."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $180K base and $180K RSUs over 4 years with the 40% Agentic Premium for this Software Engineer position. My work on the 4D GenAI infrastructure directly enables Creator Economy 2.0, where AI agents autonomously generate revenue-producing 3D experiences for 80M+ DAU. I have competing offers from Unity at $210K TC and Meta at $240K TC that reflect the market rate for engineers building agentic AI systems." Accept at $175K+ base and $160K+ RSUs.
