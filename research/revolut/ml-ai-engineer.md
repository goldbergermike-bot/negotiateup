### ML/AI Engineer — Revolut Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Revolut's US IPO Alpha strategy, translating the $9B revenue and $3.5B profit targets into an ML/AI engineering compensation framework spanning London, Vilnius, and New York markets. ML/AI Engineers at Revolut build the intelligent systems that automate fraud detection, power credit decisioning, drive personalization at scale, and enable the AI-first operational model that differentiates Revolut from legacy banks. You are building the machine intelligence layer of a $75B super-app — and the models you deploy directly impact the $3.5B profit trajectory heading into a historic US IPO.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :gb: London (GBP) | £80,000 – £130,000 | £50,000 – £170,000 | £130,000 – £300,000 |
| :lt: Vilnius (EUR) | €55,000 – €95,000 | €35,000 – €120,000 | €90,000 – €215,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $150,000 – $220,000 | $90,000 – $280,000 | $240,000 – $500,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers are among the most sought-after talent in global tech — and at Revolut, the ML/AI function is not a research lab but a production-critical revenue and profit driver. Your fraud detection models save hundreds of millions annually. Your credit scoring models enable Revolut's lending products. Your recommendation engines drive premium subscription conversions. The $9B revenue target and $3.5B profit target both flow through models you build and deploy. Pre-IPO options at a $75B secondary valuation give you asymmetric exposure to the upside — and the market for ML/AI talent is so competitive that Revolut must pay a premium to win you. Use this scarcity aggressively in your negotiation.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Revolut Level | Monzo Equivalent | N26 Equivalent | Wise Equivalent | Nubank Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| ML/AI Engineer | ML Engineer | Data Scientist / ML | ML Engineer | ML Engineer |

- **Monzo**: ML Engineers earn £75K-£115K base. Monzo's ML function is smaller and narrower in scope — Revolut's ML spans fraud, credit, personalization, NLP, and operational automation.
- **N26**: ML roles in Berlin (€55K-€90K) are limited in scale. Revolut's data volume and product breadth create ML opportunities that N26 simply cannot match.
- **Wise**: ML Engineers earn £80K-£120K with RSUs. Wise's public comp provides a floor; argue for a significant premium reflecting Revolut's richer ML problem space and pre-IPO upside.
- **Nubank**: ML Engineers ($155K-$230K) in USD markets with liquid RSUs. Nubank's ML-driven credit and fraud systems are the closest functional comparator for Revolut's ML challenges.

#### :rocket: Revolut US IPO Alpha & IPO Readiness Lever

Revolut's trajectory to **$9B in revenue** and **$3.5B in profit** is increasingly ML-driven. Fraud detection saves hundreds of millions. Credit models enable lending products generating significant revenue. Personalization and recommendation engines drive premium tier conversions. The **$75B secondary valuation** reflects the market's confidence in Revolut's ability to leverage AI/ML as a competitive moat against both neobanks and legacy institutions.

**What this means for ML/AI Engineers:**
- Your models are production-critical — they run in real-time on every transaction, every credit decision, every user interaction. This is not research; this is ML at the core of a $75B financial platform.
- IPO investors will evaluate Revolut's AI capabilities as a key competitive differentiator. The AI narrative in the S-1 — automated operations, intelligent fraud detection, personalized financial products — is built on systems you create.
- Pre-IPO options at today's strike price carry massive embedded upside. ML/AI talent scarcity means Revolut will compete with FAANG, hedge funds, and AI startups for your skills — use this to maximize your option grant.

**IPO Readiness Positioning**: Position yourself as an ML engineer who builds production-grade, explainable, compliant AI systems — not just research prototypes. IPO-grade AI systems need model governance, bias monitoring, regulatory explainability (especially for credit and fraud decisions), and documented methodology. Your ability to build ML systems that satisfy regulators and auditors directly accelerates IPO Readiness.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: ML Talent Scarcity Premium**
> "ML/AI engineers with production fintech experience are among the rarest talent profiles in the market. I'm being recruited by [FAANG/hedge fund/AI startup] at $X total comp. Revolut's options are illiquid, so I'd expect a 1.5-2x equity premium over liquid-equity offers. The pre-IPO upside at $75B justifies this premium for both sides — but only if the grant size reflects the scarcity of my skillset."

**Lever 2: Profit-Impact Model Attribution**
> "My fraud detection / credit scoring / personalization models directly impact the $3.5B profit target. If my models reduce fraud losses by even 10 basis points at Revolut's transaction volume, the annual savings exceed my total compensation many times over. I'd like the option grant to reflect this direct P&L attribution — not a generic ML engineer band."

**Lever 3: Research Publication and Domain Expertise**
> "My published work in [fraud detection/NLP/recommendation systems/LLMs] directly applies to Revolut's production ML challenges. This reduces ramp-up time, increases the probability of successful model deployment, and brings industry-recognized expertise to the team. The offer should reflect this specialized domain credibility."

**Lever 4: Competing Offers — FAANG and AI Startup Comp**
> "I have competing offers: [Google/Meta/OpenAI/Anthropic] at $X total comp with liquid equity, and [AI startup] with a significant option grant. Revolut needs to be competitive on total expected value. Given the $75B secondary valuation and IPO timeline, I'd expect the option grant to provide a clear expected-value premium over my FAANG alternative, reflecting the pre-IPO alpha."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target London £120K base + £140K options, Vilnius €85K base + €95K options, New York $210K base + $240K options. Accept-at floor: London £85K base + £65K options, Vilnius €60K base + €45K options, New York $155K base + $110K options. ML/AI engineers have maximum leverage in the current market — use it. Anchor on FAANG total comp as the baseline, then argue for an equity premium reflecting pre-IPO upside. If Revolut can't match FAANG base, push for a disproportionately large option grant. Walk away if total expected comp (including option upside at IPO) doesn't exceed your FAANG alternative by at least 20%.
