### Data Engineer — Revolut Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Revolut's US IPO Alpha strategy, translating the $9B revenue and $3.5B profit targets into a data engineering compensation framework spanning London, Vilnius, and New York markets. Data Engineers at Revolut build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers every critical business function — from real-time fraud detection to financial reporting, from credit decisioning to regulatory compliance. You are the plumbing behind the $75B fintech's data-driven decision engine, and your pipelines directly feed the financial metrics that will appear in Revolut's IPO S-1 filing.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :gb: London (GBP) | £70,000 – £110,000 | £40,000 – £130,000 | £110,000 – £240,000 |
| :lt: Vilnius (EUR) | €50,000 – €80,000 | €30,000 – €90,000 | €80,000 – €170,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $130,000 – $195,000 | $70,000 – $210,000 | $200,000 – $405,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Engineers at Revolut are building the infrastructure that transforms raw transaction data into auditable financial metrics, regulatory reports, and ML features. The $9B revenue target is measured through data pipelines you build. The $3.5B profit target is verified through financial reconciliation systems you maintain. Your pre-IPO options at a $75B secondary valuation are priced at the moment when data infrastructure becomes the single most scrutinized component of the IPO preparation — because every number in the S-1 flows through your pipelines. Frame your negotiation around data infrastructure as the foundation of IPO Readiness.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Revolut Level | Monzo Equivalent | N26 Equivalent | Wise Equivalent | Nubank Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data Engineer / Analytics Eng | Data Engineer | Data Engineer |

- **Monzo**: Data Engineers earn £65K-£100K base. Monzo's data volume is a fraction of Revolut's — fewer users, fewer products, fewer geographies means simpler data challenges.
- **N26**: Data Engineers in Berlin (€50K-€80K) work with a single-market, single-product data stack. Revolut's multi-currency, multi-product, multi-region data lake demands orders-of-magnitude more complexity.
- **Wise**: Data Engineers earn £70K-£105K with RSUs. Wise's public status means transparent comp data — use it as a floor, then demand a premium for Revolut's greater data complexity and pre-IPO upside.
- **Nubank**: Data Engineers ($135K-$200K) in USD markets. Nubank's data engineering challenges at fintech scale are the closest comparator for Revolut.

#### :rocket: Revolut US IPO Alpha & IPO Readiness Lever

Revolut's **$9B revenue** and **$3.5B profit** targets are meaningless if they can't be measured, audited, and reported accurately — and that's a data engineering problem. The **$75B secondary valuation** depends on the integrity of Revolut's financial data, which flows through pipelines built and maintained by Data Engineers.

**What this means for Data Engineers:**
- IPO financial reporting requires auditable data pipelines with lineage tracking, data quality monitoring, and reconciliation systems. Your infrastructure IS the financial reporting backbone.
- SOX compliance mandates controls on financial data processing: change management, access controls, audit logs, and data integrity checks. Data Engineers build these controls into the infrastructure layer.
- Pre-IPO options at today's strike price carry the embedded discount between the 409A/EMI valuation and the $75B secondary market. Data Engineers who join during IPO Readiness are building the most scrutinized systems in the company.

**IPO Readiness Positioning**: Position yourself as a data engineer who understands financial-grade data infrastructure — auditable pipelines, SOX-compliant data processing, real-time reconciliation, and regulatory reporting systems. The transition from private-company data infrastructure to public-company data infrastructure is a specialized challenge, and your experience with it directly accelerates IPO Readiness.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Financial Data Infrastructure Premium**
> "Data engineering at a pre-IPO financial platform is fundamentally different from data engineering at a tech company. Every pipeline I build must be auditable, reconcilable, and compliant with financial reporting standards. This financial-grade data engineering expertise commands a premium over standard data engineering roles — I'd like the option grant to reflect this specialized infrastructure requirement."

**Lever 2: Data Scale and Complexity Premium**
> "Revolut processes billions of transactions across multiple currencies, products, and geographies — creating one of the most complex data environments in global fintech. My experience with [Spark/Kafka/Flink/real-time streaming] at scale directly applies to Revolut's data challenges. This expertise in high-volume, low-latency financial data processing justifies top-of-band compensation."

**Lever 3: IPO Reporting Infrastructure as Direct Value Creation**
> "The data infrastructure I build will directly support the financial metrics reported in the S-1 filing. Revenue recognition pipelines, cost attribution systems, and user engagement metrics — these are the numbers that determine Revolut's public-market valuation. I'd like the equity to reflect this direct connection between my work and the IPO narrative."

**Lever 4: Competing Offer from Data-Intensive Company**
> "I have a competing offer from [Databricks/Snowflake/Big Tech] at $X total comp with liquid equity. These companies offer cutting-edge data infrastructure work with immediate liquidity. Choosing Revolut means accepting illiquidity in exchange for pre-IPO upside — the option grant should provide at least 1.5x the competing equity value to compensate for this tradeoff."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target London £100K base + £105K options, Vilnius €72K base + €70K options, New York $185K base + $180K options. Accept-at floor: London £75K base + £50K options, Vilnius €55K base + €38K options, New York $140K base + $85K options. Data engineers should anchor on the financial reporting premium — the data infrastructure supporting an IPO S-1 is held to a standard far above typical data engineering, and the compensation should reflect this elevated requirement. Push for explicit IPO Readiness data infrastructure ownership in the role description.
