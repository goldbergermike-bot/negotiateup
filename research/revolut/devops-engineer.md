### DevOps Engineer — Revolut Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Revolut's US IPO Alpha strategy, translating the $9B revenue and $3.5B profit targets into a DevOps engineering compensation framework spanning London, Vilnius, and New York markets. DevOps Engineers at Revolut own the infrastructure that keeps a $75B fintech running — your CI/CD pipelines, observability systems, and platform reliability directly determine whether Revolut can scale to the $9B revenue target while maintaining the uptime and compliance posture required for a US IPO.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :gb: London (GBP) | £70,000 – £110,000 | £40,000 – £120,000 | £110,000 – £230,000 |
| :lt: Vilnius (EUR) | €50,000 – €80,000 | €30,000 – €85,000 | €80,000 – €165,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $130,000 – $190,000 | $70,000 – $200,000 | $200,000 – $390,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: DevOps Engineers are the invisible force behind Revolut's reliability — and reliability is the single most scrutinized metric during an IPO. A payment platform processing billions of transactions cannot afford downtime, and the infrastructure you build is what prevents it. Your pre-IPO options at a $75B secondary valuation are priced at the moment of maximum leverage: the IPO window demands flawless operations, and you're the person delivering it. The $9B revenue target flows through systems you maintain. The $3.5B profit target depends on the cost efficiency of the infrastructure you optimize. Frame your negotiation around operational criticality during the IPO Readiness phase.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Revolut Level | Monzo Equivalent | N26 Equivalent | Wise Equivalent | Nubank Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| DevOps Engineer | Platform Engineer | DevOps / SRE | Infrastructure Engineer | DevOps Engineer |

- **Monzo**: Platform Engineers earn £65K-£100K base. Monzo's infrastructure is simpler (single product, single market) — Revolut's multi-product, multi-region platform demands significantly more DevOps complexity.
- **N26**: DevOps/SRE roles in Berlin (€50K-€80K) operate at a fraction of Revolut's scale. The Vilnius-based role offers similar cost of living with far greater equity upside.
- **Wise**: Infrastructure Engineers earn £70K-£110K with RSUs. Use Wise's public comp as your floor, then argue for a premium reflecting Revolut's greater operational complexity and pre-IPO option discount.
- **Nubank**: DevOps Engineers ($135K-$195K) in USD markets. Nubank's scale is the closest comparator for Revolut's infrastructure challenges.

#### :rocket: Revolut US IPO Alpha & IPO Readiness Lever

Revolut's **$9B revenue** and **$3.5B profit** targets depend on infrastructure that never fails. The **$75B secondary valuation** assumes that Revolut's platform can handle exponential growth — more users, more transactions, more products, more geographies — without degrading performance. DevOps Engineers are the guarantee behind that assumption.

**What this means for DevOps Engineers:**
- IPO due diligence will audit infrastructure reliability: uptime SLAs, incident response times, disaster recovery capabilities, change management processes. Your work IS the audit evidence.
- The cost efficiency of Revolut's infrastructure directly impacts the $3.5B profit target. Cloud cost optimization, right-sizing, and efficient CI/CD pipelines are profit levers that you control.
- Pre-IPO options at today's strike price carry the embedded discount between the 409A/EMI valuation and the $75B secondary market. Infrastructure engineers who join during IPO Readiness are joining at the moment of peak operational criticality.

**IPO Readiness Positioning**: Frame yourself as an "IPO Readiness infrastructure engineer" — someone who understands SOX compliance requirements for change management, audit logging, access controls, and infrastructure documentation. Public companies face infrastructure audit requirements that private companies don't. Your experience building compliant infrastructure systems directly accelerates IPO readiness.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Operational Criticality Premium**
> "DevOps at a $75B fintech processing billions in transactions is a mission-critical function. Downtime during the IPO Readiness phase would directly impact investor confidence and valuation. I'd like the option grant to reflect this operational criticality — infrastructure reliability is the foundation the $9B revenue target sits on."

**Lever 2: Infrastructure Cost Optimization as Profit Lever**
> "At my previous company, I reduced cloud infrastructure costs by X% through [right-sizing/spot instances/architecture optimization]. At Revolut's scale, even a 5% reduction in infrastructure costs translates to tens of millions in annual savings — directly feeding the $3.5B profit target. The equity grant should reflect this direct P&L impact."

**Lever 3: On-Call and Operational Burden Compensation**
> "DevOps roles carry an operational burden that pure software engineering roles don't — on-call rotations, incident response, weekend deployments. I'd like to discuss either a base salary premium of 10-15% over equivalent SWE roles or additional PTO to compensate for the operational demands of maintaining a financial-grade platform."

**Lever 4: Platform Scope and Multi-Region Complexity**
> "Revolut's infrastructure spans multiple cloud regions, regulatory jurisdictions, and product domains. Managing infrastructure at this scale requires specialized expertise in multi-region deployments, data sovereignty compliance, and financial-grade reliability. I'd like the offer to reflect the complexity premium that multi-jurisdiction fintech infrastructure commands."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target London £100K base + £95K options, Vilnius €72K base + €65K options, New York $180K base + $170K options. Accept-at floor: London £75K base + £50K options, Vilnius €55K base + €35K options, New York $140K base + $85K options. DevOps engineers should negotiate on two fronts: equity (anchored on operational criticality during IPO Readiness) and base (anchored on the on-call premium that infrastructure roles demand). If Revolut won't move on either, push for a guaranteed equity refresh at 12 months tied to uptime and cost-efficiency metrics.
