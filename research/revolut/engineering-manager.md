Engineering Managers at Revolut sit at the intersection of technical execution and organizational leverage — you own the teams building the systems that power a $75B fintech, and your ability to ship reliably and scale headcount is a direct input to IPO Readiness.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :gb: London (GBP) | £95,000 – £140,000 | £80,000 – £200,000 | £175,000 – £340,000 |
| :lt: Vilnius (EUR) | €65,000 – €100,000 | €50,000 – €140,000 | €115,000 – €240,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $170,000 – $230,000 | $120,000 – $300,000 | $290,000 – $530,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Engineering Managers are force multipliers — your impact isn't measured by lines of code but by the velocity, reliability, and retention of the teams you lead. At Revolut's scale (8,000+ employees, 40M+ users), each engineering team you manage directly contributes to the $9B revenue trajectory. Your pre-IPO options at a $75B secondary valuation represent a unique moment: you're being compensated in a currency (options) that could appreciate 30-50%+ upon US IPO. Frame your negotiation around the management premium — the idea that your leadership directly accelerates IPO Readiness by ensuring engineering teams deliver on schedule.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Revolut Level | Monzo Equivalent | N26 Equivalent | Wise Equivalent | Nubank Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager |

- **Monzo**: EMs earn £90K-£130K base with equity in a ~$5B company. Revolut's 15x valuation premium means equivalent option grants carry dramatically more upside.
- **N26**: EMs in Berlin (€70K-€100K) operate in a smaller-scale environment. Revolut's Vilnius-based EMs manage teams contributing to a $75B platform — scope and equity are not comparable.
- **Wise**: EMs earn £95K-£135K with RSUs. As a public company, Wise provides a transparent floor. Demand a premium over Wise's package to compensate for Revolut's illiquidity and pre-IPO risk.
- **Nubank**: EMs ($180K-$250K base, $150K-$300K RSUs) in USD markets. The most relevant comp for Revolut New York. Nubank's public RSUs are liquid; argue for a 1.5x equity premium at Revolut.

#### :rocket: Revolut US IPO Alpha & IPO Readiness Lever

Revolut is building toward **$9B in revenue** and **$3.5B in profit** — a financial profile that would make it one of the most profitable tech IPOs in European history. The **$75B secondary valuation** is the starting point; public-market comparisons suggest a potential IPO valuation of **$75B-$120B**.

**What this means for Engineering Managers:**
- You manage the teams that build IPO-critical infrastructure. Payments uptime, compliance automation, data integrity — these are the systems that public-market investors and regulators will scrutinize. Your team's output IS the IPO story.
- Engineering Managers are central to retention during the IPO window. If your team churns, IPO timelines slip. This gives you unique leverage: Revolut needs you to keep teams stable through the most volatile phase of the company's life.
- Your 4-year option vesting aligns with the IPO window. A strong initial grant, combined with potential refresh grants, positions you for maximum liquidity at the moment of IPO.

**IPO Readiness Positioning**: Frame yourself as an "IPO Readiness EM" — a manager who has experience preparing engineering organizations for public-market scrutiny. Emphasize your track record with SOX-relevant processes, incident management, SLA commitments, and engineering metrics that translate to investor confidence.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Management Multiplier on Equity**
> "As an Engineering Manager, my impact is multiplicative — I'm not just writing code, I'm enabling 6-10 engineers to ship at maximum velocity toward the $9B revenue target. The option grant should reflect this leverage. I'd like to discuss a grant in the top quartile of the EM band, reflecting the team-level impact on IPO Readiness."

**Lever 2: Retention Accountability Premium**
> "One of my key responsibilities will be retaining critical engineers through the IPO window. Engineering attrition during IPO preparation is the single biggest execution risk. My management directly mitigates this risk, and I'd like the equity to reflect the retention value I bring to the organization during this critical period."

**Lever 3: Signing Bonus + Relocation Package**
> "I'm relocating to [London/New York] for this role. A signing bonus of £20,000-£30,000 and a relocation package covering moving costs, temporary housing (3 months), and visa support would make the transition seamless and allow me to focus entirely on team delivery from day one."

**Lever 4: Scope and Direct Reports Confirmation**
> "I'd like to confirm the scope of this role: the number of direct reports, the product areas under my ownership, and the reporting line. The comp package should reflect the actual organizational leverage — managing 2 teams is fundamentally different from managing 1, and the option grant should scale accordingly."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target London £130K base + £160K options, Vilnius €90K base + €110K options, New York $220K base + $260K options. Accept-at floor: London £100K base + £100K options, Vilnius €70K base + €60K options, New York $175K base + $150K options. EMs should negotiate hard on both scope (number of reports, product ownership) and equity. If Revolut offers a below-median option grant, counter by quantifying the cost of engineering attrition during IPO prep — replacing a single senior engineer costs 6-9 months and £50K+ in recruiting fees, and your management prevents that loss.
