### Solutions Architect — Revolut Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Revolut's US IPO Alpha strategy, translating the $9B revenue and $3.5B profit targets into a solutions architecture compensation framework spanning London, Vilnius, and New York markets. Solutions Architects at Revolut design the technical blueprints that integrate Revolut's super-app ecosystem — payments, banking, crypto, trading, insurance — into a coherent, scalable platform capable of supporting the $9B revenue target and meeting the architectural standards required for a US IPO.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :gb: London (GBP) | £90,000 – £135,000 | £60,000 – £180,000 | £150,000 – £315,000 |
| :lt: Vilnius (EUR) | €65,000 – €100,000 | €40,000 – €120,000 | €105,000 – €220,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $160,000 – $230,000 | $100,000 – $280,000 | $260,000 – $510,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Solutions Architects operate at the intersection of business requirements and technical implementation — you're the person who translates Revolut's product ambitions into architectural reality. At a $75B secondary valuation, the platform architecture you design determines whether Revolut can scale to $9B in revenue without collapsing under its own complexity. Your pre-IPO options embed the discount between today's strike price and the eventual IPO valuation. The $3.5B profit target depends on architectural decisions that enable operational efficiency at scale — your work directly impacts the cost structure that drives profitability.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Revolut Level | Monzo Equivalent | N26 Equivalent | Wise Equivalent | Nubank Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect / Staff Eng | Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect |

- **Monzo**: Solutions Architects earn £85K-£125K base. Monzo's single-product architecture is fundamentally simpler than Revolut's super-app platform.
- **N26**: Solutions Architects in Berlin (€65K-€100K) work within a narrower technical scope. Revolut's multi-product complexity justifies a premium.
- **Wise**: Solutions Architects earn £90K-£130K with RSUs. Use Wise as a public-market floor and demand a pre-IPO equity premium.
- **Nubank**: Solutions Architects ($170K-$240K) in USD markets. Nubank's platform scale is the closest architectural comparator for Revolut.

#### :rocket: Revolut US IPO Alpha & IPO Readiness Lever

Revolut's trajectory to **$9B in revenue** and **$3.5B in profit** requires an architectural foundation that can support exponential growth across multiple product lines and geographies simultaneously. The **$75B secondary valuation** is a bet on the platform's ability to scale — and Solutions Architects are the ones who determine whether that bet pays off.

**What this means for Solutions Architects:**
- IPO auditors will scrutinize the platform architecture: data flow diagrams, system dependencies, single points of failure, disaster recovery architecture. Your documentation and design decisions ARE the IPO due diligence artifacts.
- The architectural choices you make today determine Revolut's ability to enter new markets (US banking license, new geographies) — each new market is a revenue multiplier that feeds the $9B target.
- Pre-IPO options at today's strike price are your reward for taking on the architectural risk of scaling a super-app during its most critical growth phase. The 4-year vesting schedule overlaps perfectly with the IPO window.

**IPO Readiness Positioning**: Position yourself as an architect who designs for public-market scrutiny — systems with clear ownership, documented APIs, defined SLAs, and compliance-ready data flows. During IPO Readiness, the architecture must be explainable to regulators, auditors, and investors. Your ability to create that clarity is a direct IPO enabler.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Architectural Leverage on Revenue Scale**
> "Solutions Architects make decisions that either enable or constrain Revolut's ability to reach the $9B revenue target. A well-designed payments architecture can process 10x current volume without re-architecture; a poorly designed one becomes a growth bottleneck. I'd like the option grant to reflect this architectural leverage — my design decisions have multi-year, multi-billion-dollar consequences."

**Lever 2: Super-App Integration Complexity Premium**
> "Revolut's super-app architecture — integrating banking, crypto, trading, insurance, and travel into a single platform — is one of the most complex in global fintech. This cross-domain architectural expertise is rare. I'd like the compensation to reflect the premium that multi-domain integration architects command in the market."

**Lever 3: Competing Offer from Cloud Provider / Big Tech**
> "I have an offer from [AWS/Google Cloud/Microsoft] at $X total comp with liquid RSUs and a clear career ladder. Choosing Revolut means accepting illiquidity and a less structured career path. To make this rational, I'd expect the option grant to provide at least 1.5x the face value of the competing RSU offer, reflecting the pre-IPO upside at $75B."

**Lever 4: Client-Facing and Partner Integration Scope**
> "If this role involves external-facing architecture — partner API design, B2B integration, regulatory system interfaces — the scope extends beyond internal technical design into business-critical relationship management. I'd like the offer to reflect the external-facing nature of the role with a corresponding increase in both base and equity."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target London £125K base + £145K options, Vilnius €90K base + €95K options, New York $215K base + $240K options. Accept-at floor: London £95K base + £75K options, Vilnius €68K base + €50K options, New York $165K base + $120K options. Solutions Architects should anchor on the multiplicative impact of architectural decisions — frame every design choice as a revenue enabler or constraint, and use this framing to justify a top-quartile equity grant.
