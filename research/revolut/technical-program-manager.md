#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :gb: London (GBP) | £80,000 – £125,000 | £45,000 – £130,000 | £125,000 – £255,000 |
| :lt: Vilnius (EUR) | €55,000 – €90,000 | €30,000 – €90,000 | €85,000 – €180,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $145,000 – $210,000 | $80,000 – $220,000 | $225,000 – $430,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: TPMs are the people who make the IPO timeline real. Every cross-functional dependency, every regulatory milestone, every platform migration has a TPM ensuring it ships on time. At a $75B secondary valuation, the difference between an on-time and a delayed IPO is measured in billions of dollars of valuation capture. Your pre-IPO options at today's strike price are compensation for the execution risk you manage. The $9B revenue target requires coordinated delivery across dozens of engineering teams — you're the person making that coordination happen. The $3.5B profit target depends on operational efficiency, and TPMs are the ones eliminating waste, reducing cycle times, and keeping teams aligned.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Revolut Level | Monzo Equivalent | N26 Equivalent | Wise Equivalent | Nubank Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Technical Program Manager | TPM / Project Manager | Program Manager | Technical Program Manager | Technical Program Manager |

- **Monzo**: TPM roles are less established at Monzo (£75K-£115K base). Revolut's operational complexity at 8,000+ employees demands a more mature TPM function.
- **N26**: Program Managers in Berlin (€55K-€90K) manage smaller-scale programs. Revolut's global, multi-product execution challenge is fundamentally different.
- **Wise**: TPMs earn £80K-£120K with RSUs. Wise's public comp provides a transparent floor for your Revolut negotiation.
- **Nubank**: TPMs ($150K-$220K) in USD markets with liquid RSUs. The most relevant comp for Revolut New York TPM roles.

#### :rocket: Revolut US IPO Alpha & IPO Readiness Lever

Revolut's path to **$9B in revenue** and **$3.5B in profit** is an execution challenge as much as a technical one — and TPMs own execution. The **$75B secondary valuation** assumes that Revolut can deliver on its roadmap: new markets, new products, new compliance frameworks, all while maintaining the velocity that got it to this point.

**What this means for Technical Program Managers:**
- The IPO itself is a program. S-1 preparation, SOX compliance implementation, financial reporting infrastructure, auditor coordination — these are all program-managed workstreams. A TPM with IPO preparation experience is directly accelerating the single most important program in the company's history.
- Cross-functional delivery velocity directly impacts the revenue trajectory. Every quarter of delayed product launch is revenue left on the table — and the IPO S-1 will report quarterly revenue trends. TPMs who keep programs on track are literally shaping the IPO narrative.
- Pre-IPO options with 4-year vesting align with the IPO window. TPMs who join now will vest during the period of maximum equity appreciation.

**IPO Readiness Positioning**: Frame yourself as a TPM with IPO Readiness program management experience — someone who understands the specific workstreams required to take a company public: SOX implementation programs, auditor coordination, regulatory milestone tracking, and cross-functional compliance programs. This is a rare and highly valuable skill set during the pre-IPO window.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: IPO Program Management Premium**
> "If this role involves IPO Readiness workstreams — SOX compliance, S-1 preparation, financial infrastructure buildout — the complexity and criticality justify a top-of-band option grant. IPO program management is a specialized skill, and TPMs who have done it before are exceptionally rare. I'd like the equity to reflect this IPO-specific premium."

**Lever 2: Cross-Functional Scope Multiplier**
> "As a TPM managing programs that span engineering, product, compliance, and business teams, my impact is multiplicative — I'm not executing in a single function but coordinating across the entire organization toward the $9B revenue target. The option grant should reflect this cross-functional leverage, not just a single-team IC band."

**Lever 3: Competing Offer — Big Tech TPM Comp**
> "I have an offer from [Google/Amazon/Meta] at $X total comp with liquid RSUs. Big Tech TPM roles offer structured career progression and liquid equity. Choosing Revolut means accepting illiquidity and a less defined TPM career ladder. The option grant needs to provide at least 1.3-1.5x the competing offer's equity value to justify the risk."

**Lever 4: Regulatory Program Expertise Premium**
> "My experience managing regulatory compliance programs in [financial services/payments/banking] directly applies to Revolut's multi-jurisdiction regulatory challenges. This domain expertise reduces the risk of regulatory delays that could impact the IPO timeline. I'd like the offer to reflect this specialized regulatory program management background."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target London £115K base + £105K options, Vilnius €82K base + €72K options, New York $200K base + $185K options. Accept-at floor: London £85K base + £55K options, Vilnius €60K base + €38K options, New York $150K base + $95K options. TPMs should anchor on the IPO program management premium — if you have experience managing compliance, regulatory, or IPO-adjacent programs, this is a rare and valuable background that justifies above-band compensation. Push for explicit IPO Readiness program ownership in the role description.
