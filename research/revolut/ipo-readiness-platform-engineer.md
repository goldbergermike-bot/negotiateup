### IPO Readiness Platform Engineer — Revolut Salary Negotiation Guide

## SIGNATURE ROLE

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Revolut's US IPO Alpha strategy, translating the $9B revenue and $3.5B profit targets into a specialized IPO Readiness Platform Engineering compensation framework spanning London, Vilnius, and New York markets. The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer is the apex technical role of the pre-IPO window — you are building the exact systems, infrastructure, and compliance automation that will determine whether Europe's most valuable fintech successfully completes its historic US IPO. This is not a standard platform engineering role; it is the role that bridges private-company engineering with public-company operational requirements, and the compensation should reflect the singular importance of this position in Revolut's trajectory.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :gb: London (GBP) | £110,000 – £160,000 | £150,000 – £400,000 | £260,000 – £560,000 |
| :lt: Vilnius (EUR) | €80,000 – €120,000 | €100,000 – €280,000 | €180,000 – €400,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $190,000 – $270,000 | $250,000 – $550,000 | $440,000 – $820,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer role exists because Revolut is at the most critical inflection point in its history. The company is PRIVATE at a $75B secondary valuation, targeting $9B in revenue and $3.5B in profit, and preparing for a US IPO that could be the largest European fintech listing ever. The platform systems required for public-market operations — SOX-compliant infrastructure, auditable deployment pipelines, financial-grade observability, regulatory reporting automation — must be built NOW, during the IPO Readiness window. Your pre-IPO options are not standard equity compensation; they are the last options granted before public-market pricing makes the pre-IPO discount disappear forever. Every option you negotiate today is priced at the current strike price, which is materially below the $75B secondary valuation. At IPO, these options convert to publicly tradeable shares. This is the single highest-leverage equity negotiation available at any private company in Europe.

#### Why This Role Exists: The IPO Readiness Engineering Gap

Most companies approaching an IPO discover a critical gap: their engineering infrastructure was built for a private company's needs, but public-market operations demand a fundamentally different standard. Revolut is no exception. The specific engineering challenges of IPO Readiness include:

**Financial Reporting Infrastructure**: Every dollar of the $9B revenue target must flow through auditable data pipelines with SOX-compliant controls. Revenue recognition, cost attribution, deferred revenue calculations — these must be automated, reconcilable, and audit-ready. The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer builds the infrastructure that makes this possible.

**Compliance Automation at Scale**: Revolut operates across 35+ markets with different regulatory requirements. As a public company, the compliance burden multiplies: SEC reporting, SOX 404 internal controls, enhanced KYC/AML frameworks, and multi-jurisdictional data governance. This cannot be managed manually — it requires platform-level automation that the IPO Readiness Platform Engineer designs and deploys.

**Operational Reliability for Public Scrutiny**: Public companies face quarterly earnings pressure and real-time market scrutiny. A major outage that might be a minor incident for a private company becomes a market-moving event for a public one. The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer builds the observability, incident management, and reliability systems that maintain operational confidence under public-market spotlight.

**Change Management and Deployment Governance**: SOX compliance requires documented, auditable change management processes. Every deployment must have approval chains, rollback procedures, and audit trails. The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer transforms Revolut's CI/CD pipeline from a high-velocity startup deployment system into a financial-grade, audit-ready release management platform — without sacrificing engineering velocity.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Revolut Level | Monzo Equivalent | N26 Equivalent | Wise Equivalent | Nubank Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| IPO Readiness Platform Eng (L6-L7) | Staff/Principal Engineer | Staff Platform Engineer | Staff Platform Engineer | Staff/Principal Engineer |

**Deep Comparisons:**

- **Monzo**: Staff Platform Engineers earn £100K-£140K base with equity in a ~$5B company. Monzo is not preparing for a US IPO — the scope and urgency of Revolut's IPO Readiness role is incomparable. Revolut's $75B valuation represents 15x the equity upside, and the IPO Readiness specialization adds an additional premium.

- **N26**: Staff-level platform roles at N26 (€80K-€110K) exist but lack the IPO urgency and scale. N26's regulatory challenges have been defensive (responding to regulator demands); Revolut's are offensive (proactively building public-company infrastructure). This distinction matters for compensation.

- **Wise**: Wise completed its London direct listing in 2021. Staff Platform Engineers at Wise earn £110K-£155K with RSUs worth £100K-£250K/yr. Wise is the most relevant benchmark because it is a public fintech that has already navigated the transition from private to public infrastructure. Use Wise's post-IPO comp as your floor, then argue for a significant premium reflecting:
  1. Revolut's 5x larger valuation ($75B vs. Wise's ~$12B)
  2. The pre-IPO option discount that Wise employees no longer have access to
  3. The greater complexity of Revolut's super-app platform vs. Wise's focused remittance product

- **Nubank**: Staff/Principal Engineers at Nubank ($200K-$300K base, $200K-$500K RSUs) in USD markets completed Nubank's NYSE IPO in 2021. Nubank is the gold-standard benchmark for this role — an engineer who helped build IPO-grade infrastructure at a major fintech. If you have Nubank-caliber experience, your comp should match or exceed Nubank's post-IPO Staff/Principal band, with the additional pre-IPO option alpha on top.

- **Stripe**: Pre-IPO comparison. Stripe's IPO Readiness engineering roles reportedly command $250K-$350K base with substantial option grants at Stripe's ~$65B valuation. Revolut's $75B valuation and closer IPO timeline make the comp benchmarks directly comparable.

#### :rocket: Revolut US IPO Alpha & IPO Readiness Lever

This is the definitive section for the SIGNATURE ROLE. The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer is the single most IPO-critical engineering position at Revolut.

**The $9B Revenue Target — Your Infrastructure Enables It:**
Revolut's trajectory from $2.2B (2024) to $9B in revenue requires platform infrastructure that can handle 4x growth in transaction volume, user count, and product complexity. The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer builds the infrastructure layer that makes this scaling possible without system degradation, compliance gaps, or reliability failures. Every dollar of revenue flows through your systems. Every basis point of margin depends on the efficiency of your infrastructure. The $9B target is an infrastructure problem, and you are the infrastructure solution.

**The $3.5B Profit Target — Your Efficiency Drives It:**
Revolut's path to $3.5B in profit requires not just revenue growth but operational efficiency at scale. Infrastructure cost optimization (cloud spend, compute efficiency, storage costs), automated compliance (reducing manual regulatory processes), and self-healing systems (reducing on-call burden and incident costs) all directly impact the profit line. The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer is the person who builds the systems that convert revenue growth into profit growth — and the $3.5B target depends on it.

**The $75B Secondary Valuation — Your Systems Justify It:**
Institutional investors paying $75B on secondary markets are making a bet on Revolut's ability to operate as a public company. That bet is, at its core, a bet on the platform infrastructure: Can Revolut handle public-market reporting requirements? Can it maintain reliability under quarterly scrutiny? Can it pass SOX audits? The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer builds the systems that answer "yes" to every one of these questions. Without your work, the $75B valuation is an aspiration. With it, it's a floor.

**IPO Readiness Equity — The Once-in-a-Career Window:**
Pre-IPO options granted today are priced at Revolut's current 409A/EMI valuation, which lags the $75B secondary market by a significant margin. This gap is your alpha — embedded profit locked in at the moment of grant, realized at the moment of IPO. For the IPO Readiness Platform Engineer, this alpha is maximized because:
1. Your role directly accelerates the IPO timeline — the faster you build IPO-grade infrastructure, the sooner the IPO happens, and the sooner your options become liquid.
2. Your work de-risks the IPO itself — the infrastructure you build is what auditors, regulators, and underwriters evaluate. Your systems determine whether the IPO proceeds at all.
3. Your option grant should be at the absolute top of the engineering band — there is no more IPO-critical IC role in the company.

**US IPO Timeline and Implications:**
Revolut's US IPO is anticipated in the 2026-2028 window. A New York listing on NYSE or NASDAQ would provide:
- Liquidity for all option holders — your 4-year vesting schedule aligns with this window
- Public-market valuation at $75B-$120B+ based on revenue multiples (Nubank: ~8x, Adyen: ~15x)
- Secondary offering and lockup expiry providing full liquidity within 6-12 months of listing
- The potential for Revolut to become one of the top 10 most valuable European companies by market cap

For the IPO Readiness Platform Engineer, this timeline means your first vesting cliff (25% at year 1) could coincide with the IPO filing. Your second year of vesting could coincide with the listing itself. By year 3-4, you would have fully vested options in a publicly traded company worth $75B+. This is the single most favorable equity timing available at any private company in Europe.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: IPO-Critical Role Premium — The Highest-Stakes Negotiation**
> "The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer is the most IPO-critical individual contributor role at Revolut. The infrastructure I build will be directly evaluated by auditors, regulators, and IPO underwriters. If these systems aren't built correctly and on time, the IPO doesn't happen — or happens at a discount. I'd like the option grant to reflect this existential importance. At a $75B valuation, the cost of a delayed or discounted IPO is measured in billions. My option grant should reflect a fraction of the value I protect."

**Lever 2: Stripe/Nubank IPO Engineering Parity**
> "Engineers who built IPO-grade infrastructure at Stripe and Nubank were compensated at Staff/Principal level with top-of-band equity grants. Revolut's $75B valuation exceeds Stripe's at the time of its IPO preparation, and the scope of Revolut's super-app platform exceeds Nubank's focused banking product. I'd expect compensation at parity with or above the Stripe/Nubank IPO engineering benchmark — $250K+ base with $400K+ in options over 4 years."

**Lever 3: Accelerated Vesting on IPO + Double-Trigger Protection**
> "Given that my role directly accelerates the IPO timeline, I'd like to negotiate accelerated vesting provisions: 50-100% of unvested options accelerating upon a successful US IPO. This aligns my incentives perfectly with the company's most important milestone. Additionally, I'd like double-trigger acceleration on change of control, protecting my equity in an acquisition scenario. These provisions are standard for IPO-critical engineering hires."

**Lever 4: Competing Offers — FAANG Staff/Principal vs. Pre-IPO Alpha**
> "I have competing offers at the Staff/Principal level from [Google/Meta/Amazon/Apple] at $X total comp with liquid RSUs. These offers provide financial certainty: predictable income, liquid equity, and career stability. Choosing Revolut means accepting illiquidity, higher risk, and the stress of IPO preparation. To make this rational, the expected value of my Revolut package — accounting for the pre-IPO option discount and the probability of a $75B+ IPO — must exceed my FAANG alternative by at least 50%. Let's work through the math together."

**Lever 5: Signing Bonus and Equity Bridge for Forfeited Compensation**
> "I'm forfeiting approximately $X in unvested equity and bonuses at my current employer. A signing bonus of £30,000-£50,000, combined with a supplemental option grant covering the forfeiture gap, would make the transition financially neutral. Given the IPO Readiness urgency, a 30-day delay in my start date while I search for alternative offers would cost Revolut far more than this signing bonus."

**Lever 6: Title, Scope, and Organizational Influence**
> "I'd like to confirm that this role carries Staff/Principal-level title, architectural decision-making authority, and direct influence on IPO Readiness program planning. The compensation should reflect not just IC technical contribution but the cross-organizational influence required to drive IPO infrastructure adoption across engineering teams. I'd like the title, reporting line, and decision authority documented in the offer letter."

**Lever 7: Retention and Post-IPO Commitment Structure**
> "I'm committed to seeing Revolut through the IPO and the post-IPO stabilization period. In exchange for this commitment, I'd like to discuss a retention grant — additional options vesting at the 2-year mark — that rewards loyalty through the most critical period of the company's history. This is standard practice for IPO-critical hires at companies like Airbnb, DoorDash, and Coinbase during their pre-IPO windows."

**Lever 8: Relocation and Work Arrangement Flexibility**
> "If this role requires relocation to London or New York, I'd expect a comprehensive relocation package: moving costs, 3-6 months temporary housing, visa/immigration support, and a cost-of-living adjustment for the first year. Alternatively, if remote/hybrid arrangements are possible, I'd trade relocation support for a larger option grant — the flexibility allows me to focus entirely on the IPO Readiness infrastructure buildout."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: This is the SIGNATURE ROLE. Target London £150K base + £350K options, Vilnius €110K base + €230K options, New York $260K base + $500K options. Accept-at floor: London £120K base + £200K options, Vilnius €85K base + €130K options, New York $200K base + $300K options. The IPO Readiness Platform Engineer has more negotiating leverage than any other IC role at Revolut. The work is irreplaceable, the timing is non-negotiable (IPO preparations cannot be delayed), and the candidate pool with relevant experience (SOX infrastructure, IPO-grade platforms, financial-grade CI/CD) is exceptionally small. Push for the absolute maximum option grant — this is the last pre-IPO equity window, and every option negotiated today could be worth 2-3x at public-market pricing. If Revolut's initial offer is below the 75th percentile of the benchmarks above, counter by framing the cost of NOT filling this role: a 6-month delay in IPO Readiness infrastructure costs far more in valuation erosion than the difference between a median and top-quartile option grant. Negotiate for accelerated vesting on IPO, double-trigger protection, a signing bonus covering forfeited equity, and a retention grant at the 2-year mark. This is the offer to negotiate aggressively — the pre-IPO window is closing, and both sides know it.

#### IPO Readiness Platform Engineer — Career Trajectory

**Pre-IPO (Current Window):**
- Join as IPO Readiness Platform Engineer (L6-L7)
- Build SOX-compliant infrastructure, financial reporting platforms, compliance automation
- Options vest on standard 4-year schedule with 1-year cliff
- First vesting cliff may coincide with IPO filing

**IPO Window (2026-2028):**
- Options become liquid upon IPO
- Potential for accelerated vesting (if negotiated)
- Post-IPO lockup period (typically 90-180 days)
- Equity converts from options to publicly tradeable shares

**Post-IPO (Year 2-4):**
- Transition to Staff/Principal Platform Engineer or Engineering Director
- RSU refresh grants replace option grants
- Public-company career ladder with transparent comp bands
- Opportunity to lead post-IPO platform evolution: multi-cloud, global expansion, next-gen infrastructure

**Long-Term Value:**
- The IPO Readiness experience on your resume is career-defining: it demonstrates the ability to build financial-grade infrastructure at the intersection of engineering and compliance
- Post-IPO, your institutional knowledge of Revolut's platform makes you irreplaceable for 2-3 years, ensuring strong refresh grants and promotion opportunities
- The network of IPO advisors, auditors, underwriters, and regulators you interact with during the IPO process is uniquely valuable for future career moves

---

#### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Risk 1: IPO Delay or Cancellation**
- Mitigation: The $3.5B profit target and $75B secondary valuation make IPO cancellation unlikely — profitable companies at this scale eventually go public. A delay is more likely than cancellation. Your 4-year vesting schedule provides coverage for a 1-2 year delay.
- Negotiation response: "I'd like to discuss what happens to my options if the IPO is delayed beyond 2028. Extended exercise windows (10+ years post-departure) would protect my equity in a delay scenario."

**Risk 2: Valuation Compression at IPO**
- Mitigation: Revolut's $3.5B profit target provides a valuation floor. Even at a conservative 15x P/E multiple, the company would be valued at $52B+ — still above most pre-IPO strike prices.
- Negotiation response: "I'd like to understand the current 409A/EMI valuation relative to the $75B secondary market. The gap between these numbers determines the embedded alpha in my option grant."

**Risk 3: Dilution from Additional Funding Rounds**
- Mitigation: Revolut is profitable and unlikely to raise additional dilutive rounds. If it does, the anti-dilution provisions (if any) in your option agreement matter.
- Negotiation response: "I'd like to review the option agreement's dilution protection provisions before accepting. Understanding my fully diluted ownership percentage helps me evaluate the true value of the grant."
