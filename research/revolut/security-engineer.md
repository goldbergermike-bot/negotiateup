### Security Engineer — Revolut Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Revolut's US IPO Alpha strategy, translating the $9B revenue and $3.5B profit targets into a security engineering compensation framework spanning London, Vilnius, and New York markets. Security Engineers at Revolut protect a $75B financial platform handling billions in transactions — you are the defensive layer that prevents fraud, ensures regulatory compliance, and maintains the trust that enables 40M+ users to deposit, invest, and transact through Revolut's super-app.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :gb: London (GBP) | £75,000 – £120,000 | £45,000 – £140,000 | £120,000 – £260,000 |
| :lt: Vilnius (EUR) | €55,000 – €85,000 | €30,000 – €95,000 | €85,000 – €180,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $140,000 – $200,000 | $80,000 – $230,000 | $220,000 – $430,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Security at a financial platform is not a support function — it is existential. A single security breach at Revolut could wipe billions from the $75B valuation, delay the US IPO indefinitely, and destroy the trust of 40M+ users. Your role is the difference between a successful IPO and a catastrophic headline. Pre-IPO options at today's strike price compensate you for owning this risk. The $9B revenue target only holds if security holds. The $3.5B profit target only materializes if fraud losses stay contained. Your negotiation should center on the asymmetric value of security: the cost of your salary is trivial compared to the cost of a breach.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Revolut Level | Monzo Equivalent | N26 Equivalent | Wise Equivalent | Nubank Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer |

- **Monzo**: Security Engineers earn £70K-£110K base. Monzo's threat surface is smaller (single-market, single-product) — Revolut's multi-product, multi-jurisdiction platform presents a fundamentally larger security challenge.
- **N26**: Security Engineers in Berlin (€55K-€85K). N26 has faced publicized regulatory issues related to compliance gaps — Revolut's security team operates under intense scrutiny from multiple regulators.
- **Wise**: Security Engineers earn £75K-£115K with RSUs. Public company security requirements provide a baseline; Revolut's pre-IPO transition to public-company security standards creates additional demand.
- **Nubank**: Security Engineers ($145K-$210K) in USD markets. Nubank's financial-grade security requirements are the closest comparator for Revolut's security engineering challenges.

#### :rocket: Revolut US IPO Alpha & IPO Readiness Lever

The **$9B revenue** and **$3.5B profit** targets are contingent on security. A major breach would not only cost direct financial losses but would delay or derail the US IPO entirely. The **$75B secondary valuation** embeds an assumption that Revolut's security posture is IPO-grade — and Security Engineers are the ones making that assumption true.

**What this means for Security Engineers:**
- IPO due diligence includes a comprehensive security audit: penetration testing results, incident response plans, data protection frameworks, access control policies, and crypto custody security. Your work products ARE the audit evidence.
- Regulatory requirements intensify for public companies — SOX compliance, SEC reporting, enhanced data protection obligations. Security Engineers who build these frameworks during the IPO Readiness phase are doing the work that directly enables the listing.
- Pre-IPO options carry embedded alpha: the strike price today is below the $75B secondary market valuation. Security Engineers who join now vest during the IPO window, converting illiquid options into public shares at the moment of maximum value.

**IPO Readiness Positioning**: Frame yourself as a security engineer who understands public-company security requirements — SOX controls, SEC compliance, enhanced logging and audit trails, third-party risk management. The transition from private-company security to public-company security is a specialized skillset, and your ability to execute this transition directly accelerates IPO Readiness.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Breach-Prevention Valuation Protection**
> "A single security breach at a $75B financial platform could cost hundreds of millions in direct losses and billions in valuation erosion. My role is to prevent that scenario. I'd like the option grant to reflect the asymmetric value of security — the cost of my compensation is a rounding error compared to the value I protect."

**Lever 2: Financial-Grade Security Premium**
> "Security engineering at a regulated financial institution is fundamentally different from security at a standard tech company. PCI-DSS compliance, open banking security, crypto custody, multi-jurisdiction data protection — these regulatory security requirements demand specialized expertise that commands a market premium of 15-25% over generic security roles."

**Lever 3: Competing Offer — Big Tech or Financial Services**
> "I have a competing offer from [Goldman Sachs/JPMorgan/Google Security] at $X total comp. Financial services security roles offer premium compensation because the cost of failure is existential. Revolut's security challenges are comparable to or greater than traditional banks, and the compensation should reflect that — plus a pre-IPO equity premium on top."

**Lever 4: Crypto and Digital Asset Security Expertise**
> "Revolut's crypto trading and custody services require specialized security expertise in blockchain security, wallet management, and smart contract auditing. This crypto-native security skillset is exceptionally rare and commands a significant premium. If this role includes crypto security responsibilities, the comp should reflect the specialized domain."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target London £110K base + £110K options, Vilnius €78K base + €72K options, New York $190K base + $195K options. Accept-at floor: London £80K base + £55K options, Vilnius €58K base + €38K options, New York $145K base + $95K options. Security engineers have unique leverage at a pre-IPO fintech: the cost of under-investing in security is catastrophic, and Revolut knows it. If the initial offer is below the 50th percentile, counter with specific examples of breach costs at comparable fintechs and frame your compensation as insurance against valuation destruction.
