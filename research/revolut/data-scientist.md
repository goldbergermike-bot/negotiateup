### Data Scientist — Revolut Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Revolut's US IPO Alpha strategy, translating the $9B revenue and $3.5B profit targets into a data science compensation framework spanning London, Vilnius, and New York markets. Data Scientists at Revolut are the quantitative backbone of the super-app — you build the models that drive fraud detection, credit underwriting, personalization, and pricing optimization, directly powering the $3.5B profit engine and enabling the IPO-grade financial metrics investors demand.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :gb: London (GBP) | £70,000 – £110,000 | £40,000 – £120,000 | £110,000 – £230,000 |
| :lt: Vilnius (EUR) | €50,000 – €80,000 | €30,000 – €85,000 | €80,000 – €165,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $130,000 – $190,000 | $70,000 – $200,000 | $200,000 – $390,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Data Scientists at Revolut operate at a scale few companies can match — 40M+ users generating billions of transactions, each one a data point feeding your models. The $9B revenue target depends on data-driven pricing, risk models, and personalization. Your pre-IPO options at a $75B secondary valuation are not just compensation — they're an investment in the company whose data infrastructure you're building. The $3.5B profit target specifically relies on data science: fraud loss reduction, credit risk optimization, and operational efficiency gains are all modeled by your team.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Revolut Level | Monzo Equivalent | N26 Equivalent | Wise Equivalent | Nubank Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Scientist / Analyst | Data Scientist | Data Scientist |

- **Monzo**: Data Scientists earn £65K-£100K base. Monzo's dataset is 1/5th the size of Revolut's, limiting both model complexity and compensation scale.
- **N26**: Data Scientists in Berlin (€50K-€80K) work with a smaller, single-market-focused dataset. Revolut's global, multi-product data lake is a fundamentally different analytical challenge.
- **Wise**: Data Scientists earn £70K-£105K with RSUs. Wise's public comp provides a floor; argue for a premium reflecting Revolut's richer data environment and pre-IPO option upside.
- **Nubank**: Data Scientists ($140K-$200K) in USD markets with liquid RSUs. Nubank's data science culture is strong — use their comp as the New York benchmark.

#### :rocket: Revolut US IPO Alpha & IPO Readiness Lever

Revolut's path to **$9B in revenue** and **$3.5B in profit** runs through data science. Fraud detection models save hundreds of millions annually. Credit underwriting models enable Revolut's lending products. Pricing optimization models maximize ARPU across premium tiers. The **$75B secondary valuation** is, in large part, a bet on Revolut's data advantage.

**What this means for Data Scientists:**
- Your models directly impact the financial metrics that appear in the IPO S-1: fraud loss rates, credit default rates, customer lifetime value, revenue per user. These are the numbers institutional investors scrutinize.
- Pre-IPO option grants at today's strike price embed the discount between the current 409A/EMI valuation and the $75B secondary market. This gap is your alpha.
- The 4-year vesting schedule overlaps with the IPO window. Data Scientists who join now and ship models that demonstrably improve financial metrics will be positioned for maximum refresh grants as the IPO approaches.

**IPO Readiness Positioning**: IPO-grade companies need data scientists who can produce auditable, explainable models with documented methodology — not just Jupyter notebooks. Position yourself as someone who builds production-grade, compliant, SOX-relevant data pipelines and models, directly enabling the financial reporting infrastructure that public markets require.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Profit-Impact Equity Scaling**
> "Data science at Revolut directly drives the $3.5B profit target through fraud reduction, credit optimization, and pricing models. I'd like to discuss an option grant that reflects this P&L impact — my models don't just generate insights, they protect and grow revenue at scale. The equity should reflect the direct line between my work and Revolut's profitability."

**Lever 2: Data Scale Premium**
> "Revolut's dataset — 40M+ users, billions of transactions, multi-product, multi-currency, multi-geography — is one of the richest in global fintech. Working with data at this scale requires specialized expertise in distributed computing, real-time ML, and regulatory-compliant modeling. This expertise commands a premium over standard data science roles at smaller fintechs."

**Lever 3: Competing Offer — Tech Company Data Science Comp**
> "I have a competing offer from [Google/Meta/public fintech] at $X total comp with liquid RSUs. Revolut's options are illiquid, so I'd expect a 1.3-1.5x equity premium to compensate for the liquidity discount. The pre-IPO upside at $75B makes this premium reasonable for both sides."

**Lever 4: Publishing and Research Credibility**
> "My published research in [fraud detection/NLP/recommendation systems] directly applies to Revolut's product challenges. This domain expertise reduces ramp-up time and increases the probability that my models will ship to production quickly, accelerating the IPO Readiness timeline. I'd like the offer to reflect this specialized background."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target London £100K base + £95K options, Vilnius €72K base + €65K options, New York $180K base + $170K options. Accept-at floor: London £75K base + £50K options, Vilnius €55K base + €35K options, New York $140K base + $85K options. Data scientists should anchor on the profit impact of their models — if you can credibly claim your fraud/credit/pricing models will save or generate $X million annually, your option grant should be a fraction of that value. Push for a data science-specific equity band rather than a generic IC band.
