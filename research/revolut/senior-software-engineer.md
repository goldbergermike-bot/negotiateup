### Senior Software Engineer — Revolut Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Revolut's US IPO Alpha strategy, translating the $9B revenue and $3.5B profit targets into a senior engineering compensation framework spanning London, Vilnius, and New York markets. As a Senior Software Engineer, you are the technical backbone of Revolut's product velocity — the experienced builders who own systems, mentor teams, and ship the features that convert Revolut's 40M+ users into the $9B revenue machine heading toward its US IPO.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :gb: London (GBP) | £80,000 – £115,000 | £60,000 – £150,000 | £140,000 – £265,000 |
| :lt: Vilnius (EUR) | €55,000 – €85,000 | €40,000 – €100,000 | €95,000 – €185,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $150,000 – $200,000 | $100,000 – $250,000 | $250,000 – $450,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: At the Senior level, equity becomes the dominant compensation lever. Revolut's PRIVATE status at a $75B secondary valuation means your pre-IPO options carry embedded alpha that disappears the moment the company goes public. The $9B revenue target and $3.5B profit trajectory aren't aspirational — they're the financial infrastructure being built by engineers at your level. Every system you architect, every performance optimization you ship, directly accelerates the IPO timeline. Your negotiation should center on IPO Readiness equity: the argument that senior engineers joining in the final pre-IPO window deserve option grants that reflect their outsized impact on IPO-critical systems.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Revolut Level | Monzo Equivalent | N26 Equivalent | Wise Equivalent | Nubank Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Senior Software Engineer (L4-L5) | Senior Engineer | Senior Engineer | Senior Software Engineer | Senior Software Engineer |

- **Monzo**: London Senior Engineers earn £75K-£105K base with equity in a ~$5B company. Revolut's $75B valuation represents 15x the equity upside at comparable grant sizes.
- **N26**: Senior Engineers in Berlin earn €65K-€90K. N26's regulatory struggles and slower growth make Revolut's Vilnius office a stronger equity play despite similar base ranges.
- **Wise**: Senior Engineers earn £85K-£120K with RSUs. Wise is public — use their transparent comp data as your negotiation floor, then argue for a premium reflecting Revolut's pre-IPO option discount.
- **Nubank**: Senior Engineers in USD markets ($160K-$220K base) provide the clearest comp benchmark for Revolut's New York office. Nubank's public status means no option discount — Revolut's pre-IPO positioning is the differentiator.

#### :rocket: Revolut US IPO Alpha & IPO Readiness Lever

Revolut is on a trajectory to **$9B in revenue** and **$3.5B in profit**, making it the most financially dominant private fintech globally. The **$75B secondary valuation** reflects where sophisticated investors price the company today — but a US IPO at comparable public-market multiples (Nubank trades at ~8x revenue) could see Revolut valued at $70B-$100B+ on day one.

**What this means for Senior Software Engineers:**
- Your 4-year option vesting aligns perfectly with the anticipated IPO window (2026-2028). A grant today means your options could become liquid within 1-2 vesting cycles.
- Senior Engineers own critical systems — payments infrastructure, compliance engines, card processing, crypto trading. These are the exact systems that IPO auditors and public-market investors scrutinize. Your work directly de-risks the IPO.
- Pre-IPO strike prices are set at the latest 409A/EMI valuation, which lags the $75B secondary market. This gap is your embedded profit — locked in at grant, realized at IPO.

**IPO Readiness Positioning**: Senior Engineers are the "IPO Readiness" tier — experienced enough to own systems end-to-end, technical enough to build the reliability, observability, and compliance infrastructure that public markets demand. Frame your negotiation around this: you're not just joining a company, you're joining an IPO buildout, and your equity should reflect that once-in-a-career timing.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Pre-IPO Option Grant Escalation**
> "I understand the standard option grant for Senior Engineers is in the £60K-£150K range over four years. Given that Revolut's $75B secondary valuation suggests significant upside at IPO, and that I'll be owning IPO-critical systems during the Readiness phase, I'd like to discuss a grant at the top of the band or above — the asymmetric return profile justifies it for both sides."

**Lever 2: Competing Offer Leverage — Public vs. Private Equity**
> "I have an offer from [Wise/public fintech] with $X in RSUs that vest into liquid shares immediately. Revolut's options are illiquid and carry execution risk. To compensate for this liquidity discount, I'd expect a 1.5-2x premium on the equity component relative to a public-company RSU offer of equivalent face value."

**Lever 3: Signing Bonus for Forfeited Equity**
> "I'm forfeiting approximately £X in unvested equity at my current employer. A signing bonus of £15,000-£25,000, or a supplemental option grant to bridge the forfeiture, would make the transition viable without requiring me to take a compensation step-back during the most critical phase of my career."

**Lever 4: Level Negotiation — L4 vs. L5**
> "Based on my experience owning production systems at scale and mentoring junior engineers, I believe L5 is the appropriate level for this role. The difference in option grant between L4 and L5 is material, and I'd like to ensure we're aligned on leveling before discussing specific numbers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target London £105K+ base with £120K+ in options (4yr), Vilnius €78K+ base with €75K+ options, New York $190K+ base with $200K+ options. Your accept-at floor: London £85K base + £80K options, Vilnius €60K base + €50K options, New York $155K base + $120K options. The critical negotiation is equity, not base — push for the maximum option grant and negotiate accelerated vesting triggers tied to IPO. If Revolut's initial offer is at the bottom of the range, counter with competing public-company offers to demonstrate the liquidity premium you're sacrificing.
