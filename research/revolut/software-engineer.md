At the Software Engineer level, you are the foundation of Revolut's hyper-growth engineering machine — the builders shipping the product features that drive the $9B revenue engine toward a historic US IPO.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| :gb: London (GBP) | £55,000 – £80,000 | £30,000 – £60,000 | £85,000 – £140,000 |
| :lt: Vilnius (EUR) | €40,000 – €60,000 | €20,000 – €45,000 | €60,000 – €105,000 |
| :us: New York (USD) | $110,000 – $150,000 | $50,000 – $100,000 | $160,000 – $250,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Revolut's PRIVATE status at a $75B secondary valuation makes pre-IPO options the single most asymmetric lever in your offer. Every option granted today is priced at the current strike — if the US IPO prices at or above the $75B secondary mark, your equity converts into publicly liquid shares at a substantial premium. The $9B revenue trajectory and $3.5B profit target signal that Revolut isn't a speculative bet; it's an IPO-ready profit machine. Frame your negotiation around IPO Readiness equity: you are joining at the last window before public-market pricing eliminates the option discount.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Revolut Level | Monzo Equivalent | N26 Equivalent | Wise Equivalent | Nubank Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Software Engineer (L3) | Software Engineer | Engineer II | Software Engineer | Software Engineer |

- **Monzo**: Similar London base (£55K-£75K) but smaller equity pool; Monzo's valuation (~$5B) offers far less upside than Revolut's $75B trajectory.
- **N26**: Berlin-based, EUR-denominated; comparable base in Vilnius but N26's stagnating growth limits equity narrative.
- **Wise**: Public company (LSE-listed); offers RSUs not options — no pre-IPO discount available. Use Wise's public comp data as a floor.
- **Nubank**: Latin American fintech titan (NYSE: NU); higher base in USD markets but different risk profile. Revolut's European dominance + US expansion creates a differentiated upside story.

#### :rocket: Revolut US IPO Alpha & IPO Readiness Lever

Revolut is targeting **$9B in revenue** and **$3.5B in profit** — numbers that position it as the most profitable private fintech on Earth. The **$75B secondary valuation** already reflects institutional confidence, but a US IPO could reprice the company at $100B+ based on public-market fintech multiples (compare Nubank at ~8x revenue).

**What this means for Software Engineers:**
- Your options vest over 4 years on a standard schedule. If the IPO occurs in 2026-2027, you could see liquidity within your first vesting cliff.
- Pre-IPO option grants are priced at the latest 409A/EMI valuation — significantly below the $75B secondary market price. This discount IS your alpha.
- Revolut's revenue per employee (~$500K+) demonstrates the leverage each engineer provides. Your code directly drives the $9B engine.

**IPO Readiness Positioning**: In your negotiation, frame yourself as joining during the "IPO Readiness" phase — the final build-out of systems, compliance infrastructure, and product scale required for public-market scrutiny. This framing elevates your role from "individual contributor" to "IPO enabler," justifying a premium equity grant.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Pre-IPO Option Grant Maximization**
> "Given Revolut's $75B secondary valuation and the proximity of a US IPO, I'd like to discuss increasing the option grant. Pre-IPO options represent a once-in-a-career asymmetric opportunity, and I want to ensure my equity reflects the contribution I'll make during this critical IPO Readiness phase."

**Lever 2: Geographic Arbitrage — London vs. New York**
> "I notice the New York offer is benchmarked to local market rates, but the role contributes to the same $9B revenue target regardless of location. I'd like to explore whether the London package can be adjusted to reflect the global impact of the work, particularly given London's lower cost of living relative to the value generated."

**Lever 3: Signing Bonus as Risk Bridge**
> "I'm leaving vested equity at my current company. A signing bonus of £10,000-£15,000 would bridge the gap between my current liquid compensation and the illiquid but high-upside option grant, making the transition financially neutral in year one."

**Lever 4: Accelerated Vesting Trigger on IPO**
> "Given the IPO timeline, I'd like to discuss whether Revolut offers any accelerated vesting provisions tied to a liquidity event. Even partial acceleration on IPO would align my incentives with the company's most critical milestone."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target the top of the base range (London: £80K, NY: $150K) and push for a 1.5x multiplier on the initial option grant. Your accept-at floor should be: London £65K base + £45K options, Vilnius €48K base + €30K options, New York $125K base + $75K options. If Revolut won't move on base, shift the conversation entirely to equity — every additional option at pre-IPO pricing is worth multiples at public-market valuation. Walk away if total comp falls below the 25th percentile of the benchmarks above AND the option grant is below median.
