**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Bill.com orchestrate the cross-functional execution of the company's most complex initiatives — and none is more complex or consequential than the Agentic AP/AR Automation platform buildout. You manage the intersection of engineering, product, design, data science, compliance, and operations across programs that serve 475,000+ businesses processing real financial transactions. Your ability to drive execution clarity across these teams directly determines whether Bill.com captures its share of the $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity on schedule.

The TPM role at Bill.com is uniquely challenging because financial automation programs carry regulatory, compliance, and reliability requirements that do not exist in typical SaaS environments. When you manage the rollout of a new Agentic AP feature, you are coordinating engineering delivery, compliance approvals, banking partner certifications, and customer communication across the core AP/AR platform, Divvy spend management, and Invoice2go. The financial back-office automation vision only becomes reality when all of these workstreams converge — and that convergence is your responsibility.

Bill.com's $1.3B+ revenue and NYSE listing mean your program milestones are tied to public commitments. Revenue-Cycle bonuses for TPMs reward on-time delivery of revenue-generating features, cross-team efficiency improvements, and successful program execution that accelerates Bill.com's mid-market expansion. Your negotiation leverage comes from the direct line between your execution capability and the company's ability to deliver on its Agentic AP roadmap.

### Agentic AP — The Revenue-Cycle Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic AP Program Complexity Premium:** "I'll be managing the cross-functional delivery of Bill.com's Agentic AP/AR Automation programs — the most technically complex and commercially consequential initiatives at the company. These programs span engineering, compliance, banking partnerships, and customer rollout across 475,000+ businesses in pursuit of the $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity. My experience managing [financial platform programs / regulated technology rollouts / multi-team AI product launches] positions me to drive this execution at speed. I'm targeting $195K base to reflect the program complexity premium."

**Lever 2 — Revenue-Cycle Delivery Milestone Bonus:** "TPMs at Bill.com should have bonus structures tied to Revenue-Cycle delivery outcomes. I'd like a 16% bonus target with multipliers tied to on-time delivery of Agentic AP feature milestones and their subsequent adoption metrics. Specifically, a 1.5x multiplier when programs I manage launch on schedule and achieve target adoption within the first quarter. This directly ties my comp to Revenue-Cycle velocity."

**Lever 3 — Divvy Cross-Platform Program Equity:** "My program scope will span the core Bill.com AP/AR platform, Divvy spend management, and Invoice2go — managing the program dependencies and integration timelines across the entire financial back-office automation portfolio. Cross-platform TPMs who successfully coordinate multi-product launches create outsized organizational value. I'd like RSU grants at $170K/4yr to reflect this cross-product program ownership."

**Lever 4 — Mid-Market Launch Readiness Signing Bonus:** "Bill.com's push into mid-market accounts requires coordinated program execution across sales, engineering, compliance, and customer success — exactly the kind of complex, multi-stakeholder program management I've led at [previous company]. The mid-market segment represents the highest-value tier of the $2.6T B2B opportunity, and having an experienced TPM drive launch readiness accelerates Revenue-Cycle growth. A $30,000 signing bonus reflects the immediate execution value I bring to these critical programs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $195K base for San Jose with $170K RSU/4yr, framing your program management expertise as the execution engine behind Bill.com's Agentic AP Revenue-Cycle roadmap. Push for a 16% bonus target with delivery milestone multipliers and a $30K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $175K base, $130K RSU/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus — targeting minimum year-one comp of $345K. Any offer below $310K total comp undervalues the execution premium of a TPM managing Agentic AP program delivery for a platform serving 475,000+ businesses in the $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity.
