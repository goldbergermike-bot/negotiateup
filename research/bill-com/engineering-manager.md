**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Bill.com lead the teams that build and operate the Agentic AP/AR Automation platform — the company's core technology bet for capturing the $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity. You are responsible for the velocity, quality, and strategic alignment of engineering output across mission-critical financial systems that serve 475,000+ businesses. Your decisions about team composition, technical priorities, and execution cadence directly shape whether Bill.com ships the agentic capabilities that drive Revenue-Cycle growth.

The scope of management at Bill.com extends beyond traditional people leadership. You are managing teams that ship code touching real money — accounts payable automation, vendor payment orchestration, Divvy spend management, and Invoice2go integrations. The regulatory, compliance, and reliability requirements of financial back-office automation make engineering management at Bill.com distinctly more complex than at a typical SaaS company. Revenue-Cycle bonuses for managers are tied to team-level outcomes: feature delivery velocity, platform reliability metrics, and customer adoption of Agentic AP capabilities.

Bill.com's $1.3B+ revenue and continued growth give Engineering Managers genuine organizational influence. You are not managing a cost center — you are leading a revenue engine. This Revenue-Cycle framing is the foundation of your negotiation strategy: your team's output directly drives Bill.com's ability to convert the $2.6T mid-market opportunity into booked revenue.

### Agentic AP — The Revenue-Cycle Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic AP Team Leadership Premium:** "I'll be leading the team directly responsible for Bill.com's Agentic AP/AR Automation platform — the technology that is central to capturing the $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity. My experience building and scaling engineering teams in [fintech / payments / financial automation] means I can recruit, retain, and execute at the pace this initiative demands. I'm targeting a base of $235K to reflect the strategic importance of this team's output to Bill.com's Revenue-Cycle trajectory."

**Lever 2 — Revenue-Cycle Team Performance Bonus:** "As an Engineering Manager, my bonus should be structured around Revenue-Cycle team outcomes rather than individual contribution. I'd like to negotiate a 20% bonus target with multipliers tied to Agentic AP feature delivery milestones and adoption metrics across the 475,000+ business customer base. When my team ships features that drive revenue, my comp should reflect that direct contribution."

**Lever 3 — Divvy Integration Talent Equity:** "My team's scope will include Divvy spend management integrations — a critical product line in Bill.com's financial back-office automation vision. Building and retaining the talent to execute cross-platform integration work requires competitive equity packages. I'd like my RSU grant moved to $280K/4yr, with annual refresh commitments of $60K+ per year to ensure I can recruit the caliber of engineers this initiative requires without personal comp erosion."

**Lever 4 — Mid-Market Scaling Signing Bonus:** "Bill.com's push into the mid-market — the highest-value segment of the $2.6T B2B opportunity — requires engineering teams that can deliver enterprise-grade reliability and compliance. I've built and led teams through exactly this kind of upmarket transition at [previous company], scaling from SMB to mid-market while maintaining velocity. A $50,000 signing bonus reflects the immediate organizational impact of experienced leadership during this critical Revenue-Cycle growth phase."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $235K base for San Jose with $280K RSU/4yr, framing yourself as a Revenue-Cycle-aligned engineering leader whose team directly builds Agentic AP capabilities. Push for a 20% bonus target with team adoption multipliers and a $50K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $210K base, $220K RSU/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus — targeting minimum year-one comp of $450K. Any offer below $400K total comp undervalues the leadership premium required to manage teams building agentic financial automation for 475,000+ businesses.
