**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Bill.com build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers the Agentic AP/AR Automation platform. The scale is significant: 475,000+ businesses generating billions of financial transactions that must flow through real-time pipelines, be transformed for ML model training, feed analytics dashboards, and satisfy financial regulatory requirements — all with the accuracy and auditability that processing real money demands. Your data pipelines are the circulatory system of Bill.com's financial back-office automation platform.

The $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity depends on Bill.com's ability to turn transaction data into intelligent automation. Every Agentic AP capability — intelligent invoice matching, predictive payment scheduling, automated vendor risk scoring — requires clean, timely, and reliable data flowing through pipelines you design and operate. When your data infrastructure enables faster ML model iteration or more accurate financial analytics, you are directly accelerating Revenue-Cycle outcomes for the business.

Bill.com's $1.3B+ revenue and the breadth of its product portfolio — core AP/AR, Divvy spend management, and Invoice2go — create a rich and complex data landscape. Data Engineers who can build unified data architectures across these platforms, while maintaining the compliance and audit requirements of a publicly traded fintech on the NYSE, bring specialized value that commands a premium. Revenue-Cycle bonuses reward pipeline reliability, data freshness improvements, and infrastructure contributions that accelerate Agentic AP feature development.

### Agentic AP — The Revenue-Cycle Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic AP Data Infrastructure Premium:** "The Agentic AP/AR Automation platform depends on real-time data pipelines that can process, transform, and serve financial transaction data at the scale of 475,000+ businesses. My experience with [real-time streaming architectures / financial data warehousing / ML feature engineering pipelines] maps directly to the data infrastructure Bill.com needs to capture the $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity. I'm targeting $190K base to reflect the specialized nature of building financial-grade data infrastructure at this scale."

**Lever 2 — Revenue-Cycle Data Reliability Bonus:** "Data pipeline reliability directly drives Revenue-Cycle outcomes — when pipelines fail, Agentic AP features cannot function and financial reporting is delayed across 475,000+ businesses. I'd like a 14% bonus target with multipliers tied to data pipeline SLAs (99.9%+ availability), data freshness improvements, and the reduction of data-quality incidents that impact downstream ML models. When my infrastructure work accelerates Revenue-Cycle feature delivery, my comp should reflect that."

**Lever 3 — Divvy Cross-Platform Data Architecture Equity:** "My data engineering scope will span the core Bill.com AP/AR transaction data, Divvy spend management data, and Invoice2go invoicing data — building the unified data architecture that ties the financial back-office automation suite together. Data Engineers who create cross-product data platforms enable insights and automation that individual product silos cannot achieve. I'd like RSU grants at $160K/4yr to reflect this platform-level data ownership."

**Lever 4 — Mid-Market Data Compliance Signing Bonus:** "Bill.com's expansion into mid-market accounts — the most valuable segment of the $2.6T B2B opportunity — requires enterprise-grade data governance: data lineage tracking, GDPR-compliant data processing, audit-ready reporting pipelines, and role-based data access controls. My experience building compliant data infrastructure at [previous company] gives me direct expertise in the data governance requirements mid-market customers demand. A $25,000 signing bonus reflects the immediate Revenue-Cycle value of accelerating data compliance readiness."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $190K base for San Jose with $160K RSU/4yr, positioning yourself as a financial data infrastructure specialist whose pipeline expertise directly powers the Agentic AP intelligence layer and Revenue-Cycle feature delivery. Push for a 14% bonus target with data reliability multipliers and a $25K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $170K base, $125K RSU/4yr, and a $18K signing bonus — targeting minimum year-one comp of $320K. Any offer below $290K total comp undervalues the Revenue-Cycle data infrastructure premium for an engineer building the financial data backbone that 475,000+ businesses depend on.
