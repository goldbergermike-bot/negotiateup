**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Bill.com operate at the intersection of technical strategy and business impact. You are not writing features — you are defining the technical direction of platforms that process billions of dollars for 475,000+ businesses. Bill.com's Agentic AP/AR Automation initiative represents the company's most consequential technology bet: building AI-driven systems that can autonomously manage the entire accounts payable and accounts receivable lifecycle for SMBs and mid-market companies. As a Staff Engineer, you will own the architecture of these systems, set standards that dozens of engineers follow, and make decisions whose impact compounds over years.

The $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity gives Bill.com its growth narrative, and Staff Engineers are the ones who make that narrative technically feasible. Whether it's designing the ML inference pipeline that powers intelligent invoice matching, architecting the real-time payment orchestration layer, or building the next generation of Divvy's spend management platform, your work has direct, measurable impact on revenue. This is why Revenue-Cycle compensation at the Staff level can be transformative — the bonus multipliers and RSU refresh grants are calibrated to the enormous financial leverage your technical decisions create.

Bill.com's $1.3B+ revenue and NYSE listing provide the financial foundation for Staff-level packages, but the Agentic AP transition creates a talent scarcity premium. Few engineers in the market have built production-grade agentic financial systems at scale. If you bring this experience, you should price it accordingly — and Bill.com has the budget to pay for it.

### Agentic AP — The Revenue-Cycle Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic AP Technical Vision Premium:** "At the Staff level, I'll be defining the architecture and technical roadmap for Bill.com's Agentic AP/AR Automation platform — the system that is central to capturing the $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity. My track record of [designing distributed financial systems / leading platform migrations / shipping ML-powered automation at scale] means I can accelerate this roadmap by 6-12 months. I'm targeting a base of $250K to reflect the technical vision ownership that Staff-level roles demand at a $10B+ fintech company."

**Lever 2 — Revenue-Cycle Equity Acceleration:** "Staff Engineers at Bill.com should have deep equity alignment with Revenue-Cycle outcomes. I'd like to negotiate the RSU package to $360K/4yr with annual refresh grants guaranteed at no less than $80K/year for the first two years, contingent on Agentic AP platform milestones. This ensures my equity tracks the value I'm creating as the platform scales from 475,000+ businesses to the broader mid-market segment."

**Lever 3 — Divvy and Invoice2go Platform Unification Premium:** "My scope will span Bill.com's core AP/AR engine, Divvy's spend management platform, and Invoice2go — effectively the entire financial back-office automation stack. Cross-platform Staff Engineers who drive architectural convergence across these products create compounding value. I'd like a Revenue-Cycle bonus target of 25% with a 2x multiplier for achieving integration milestones, reflecting the outsized impact of platform unification work."

**Lever 4 — Mid-Market Enterprise Architecture Signing Bonus:** "Bill.com's expansion into mid-market accounts — the most valuable segment of the $2.6T B2B opportunity — requires enterprise-grade reliability, compliance infrastructure, and multi-tenant architecture patterns that I've built and operated at [previous company]. A $60,000 signing bonus reflects the immediate value I bring to this transition and bridges any comp gap while Revenue-Cycle equity appreciation materializes over the vesting period."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor aggressively at $250K base for San Jose and $360K RSU/4yr, positioning yourself as a Staff Engineer whose Agentic AP architecture experience directly accelerates Bill.com's Revenue-Cycle growth. Push for a 25% bonus target with adoption-based multipliers and a $60K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $230K base, $280K RSU/4yr, and a $40K signing bonus — targeting minimum year-one comp of $500K. Any offer below $460K total comp fails to reflect the technical leadership premium that Staff Engineers at Bill.com's Agentic AP inflection point rightfully command.
