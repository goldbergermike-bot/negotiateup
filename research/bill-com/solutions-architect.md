**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Bill.com are the technical bridge between the platform's Agentic AP/AR Automation capabilities and the 475,000+ businesses that need to integrate these capabilities into their existing financial workflows. You translate complex technology into deployable, revenue-generating solutions — designing integration architectures, leading technical evaluations, and ensuring that mid-market customers in the $2.6T B2B opportunity can successfully adopt Bill.com's financial back-office automation platform. Your technical credibility directly closes deals and drives expansion revenue.

The Agentic AP transition makes the Solutions Architect role at Bill.com especially consequential. Mid-market and enterprise prospects need to understand how AI-driven accounts payable automation integrates with their ERP systems, banking partners, and existing approval workflows. They need architecture diagrams, security reviews, and implementation plans that demonstrate Bill.com's platform — including Divvy spend management and Invoice2go — can replace their manual financial processes with intelligent automation. You are the person who makes this case, and your effectiveness directly drives Revenue-Cycle growth.

Bill.com's $1.3B+ revenue and NYSE listing create the market credibility that mid-market customers demand, but it is your technical architecture expertise that converts that credibility into signed contracts. Revenue-Cycle bonuses for Solutions Architects are often structured with deal-influence components, tying your compensation to the revenue you help generate through successful technical evaluations and implementation designs.

### Agentic AP — The Revenue-Cycle Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic AP Technical Evangelism Premium:** "As a Solutions Architect, I'll be the technical face of Bill.com's Agentic AP/AR Automation platform to mid-market prospects — the highest-value segment of the $2.6T B2B opportunity. My ability to design and present integration architectures for AI-driven financial automation directly influences deal velocity and win rates across the 475,000+ business customer base. I'm targeting $200K base to reflect the revenue-influencing nature of this role."

**Lever 2 — Revenue-Cycle Deal Influence Bonus:** "Solutions Architects at Bill.com directly influence deal outcomes — my technical presentations and architecture designs are often the deciding factor in mid-market evaluations. I'd like a 20% bonus target structured as a Revenue-Cycle bonus with deal-influence multipliers: a 1.5x multiplier when deals I technically evaluate close above $100K ARR, and a 2x multiplier for deals above $250K ARR. This ties my comp to the Revenue-Cycle outcomes I directly enable."

**Lever 3 — Divvy Enterprise Integration Equity:** "My architecture scope spans integrations across Bill.com's core AP/AR platform, Divvy spend management, and Invoice2go — designing how the complete financial back-office automation suite connects to customer ERP systems, banking partners, and accounting software. Solutions Architects who master cross-product integration architecture create scalable value across the entire platform. I'd like RSU grants at $170K/4yr to reflect this broad technical ownership."

**Lever 4 — Mid-Market Technical Readiness Signing Bonus:** "Bill.com's push into mid-market accounts within the $2.6T B2B opportunity requires Solutions Architects who can navigate complex enterprise evaluations — security reviews, compliance audits, multi-stakeholder technical presentations. My experience leading technical pre-sales for mid-market financial technology deployments at [previous company] means I can contribute to Revenue-Cycle deal velocity from day one. A $30,000 signing bonus reflects this immediate productivity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $200K base for San Jose with $170K RSU/4yr, framing yourself as a revenue-influencing Solutions Architect whose Agentic AP technical expertise directly closes mid-market deals in the $2.6T B2B opportunity. Push for a 20% Revenue-Cycle bonus target with deal-influence multipliers and a $30K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $180K base, $130K RSU/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus — targeting minimum year-one comp of $360K. Any offer below $320K total comp underprices the Revenue-Cycle deal influence of a Solutions Architect positioning Agentic AP automation to 475,000+ businesses.
