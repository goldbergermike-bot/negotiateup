**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Bill.com sit at the nexus of customer insight, technical capability, and business strategy. You define what gets built — and at a company whose Agentic AP/AR Automation platform serves 475,000+ businesses, what gets built determines whether Bill.com captures its share of the $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity. Your product roadmap decisions directly shape the company's Revenue-Cycle trajectory: which automation features drive adoption, which integrations unlock new market segments, and how Divvy and Invoice2go evolve within the broader financial back-office ecosystem.

The Agentic AP transition elevates the PM role at Bill.com beyond traditional feature management. You are defining how AI agents interact with financial data, how autonomous workflows handle edge cases in accounts payable and receivable, and how the platform scales from SMB customers to mid-market enterprises with more complex financial operations. This requires deep domain expertise in B2B payments, financial workflows, and AI product design — a combination that is scarce in the market and commands a Revenue-Cycle compensation premium.

Bill.com's $1.3B+ revenue provides the investment capacity for ambitious product bets, and its NYSE listing means your product decisions are visible to public market investors. Frame your negotiation around the direct line from your product roadmap to Revenue-Cycle outcomes: when you ship Agentic AP features that drive adoption among 475,000+ businesses, you are directly generating the revenue that supports your equity appreciation.

### Agentic AP — The Revenue-Cycle Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic AP Product Vision Premium:** "I'll be defining the product strategy for Bill.com's Agentic AP/AR Automation capabilities — the features that will determine whether Bill.com captures its share of the $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity. My background in [AI product management / financial workflow design / B2B platform strategy] means I can translate the Agentic AP technical vision into a product roadmap that drives measurable adoption. I'm targeting $200K base to reflect the strategic ownership this role demands."

**Lever 2 — Revenue-Cycle Adoption Bonus:** "Product Managers at Bill.com should have bonus structures directly tied to Revenue-Cycle adoption metrics. I'd like to negotiate an 18% bonus target with multipliers tied to Agentic AP feature adoption rates among the 475,000+ business customer base. Specifically, a 1.5x multiplier when quarterly AP automation adoption exceeds plan by 10%+. This ensures my comp scales with the business outcomes I'm driving."

**Lever 3 — Divvy and Invoice2go Cross-Product Equity:** "My product scope will span core Bill.com AP/AR, Divvy spend management, and Invoice2go — the full financial back-office automation stack. Product Managers who drive cross-product strategy and integration create disproportionate enterprise value. I'd like the RSU package at $200K/4yr to reflect this cross-platform ownership, with annual refresh grants of $50K+ to maintain equity alignment as these products converge."

**Lever 4 — Mid-Market Expansion Signing Bonus:** "Bill.com's growth into mid-market accounts is the most consequential product strategy shift underway — it's where the highest-value portion of the $2.6T B2B opportunity lives. My experience shipping enterprise-grade products for mid-market buyers at [previous company] gives me direct domain expertise in this transition. A $35,000 signing bonus reflects the immediate Revenue-Cycle impact of a PM who can accelerate the mid-market product roadmap from day one."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $200K base for San Jose with $200K RSU/4yr, framing your Agentic AP product expertise as a scarce skill set that directly determines Bill.com's Revenue-Cycle trajectory. Push for an 18% bonus target with adoption multipliers and a $35K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $180K base, $160K RSU/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus — targeting minimum year-one comp of $390K. Any offer below $350K total comp underprices the product leadership premium for a PM defining Agentic AP strategy at a $10B+ fintech platform serving 475,000+ businesses.
