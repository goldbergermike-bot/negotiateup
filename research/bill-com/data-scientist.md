**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Bill.com have an unusual advantage: they work with one of the richest financial transaction datasets in the B2B fintech space. With 475,000+ businesses processing payments through the platform, every model you build, every insight you surface, and every experiment you run operates on data that directly represents real-world financial behavior across the $2.6T mid-market B2B economy. Your analyses power the Agentic AP/AR Automation engine — the intelligent systems that predict payment timing, detect fraud, optimize cash flow, and automate the financial back-office for SMBs and mid-market companies.

The Revenue-Cycle implications of data science at Bill.com are direct and measurable. When your models improve invoice matching accuracy, that drives adoption. When your experiments optimize the onboarding funnel for Divvy spend management, that drives revenue. When your fraud detection systems reduce losses, that protects margin. Bill.com's leadership understands this leverage, which is why Data Scientists participate in Revenue-Cycle bonus structures that reward quantifiable business impact.

Bill.com's $1.3B+ revenue and NYSE listing mean your work is scrutinized by investors who care about metrics like net revenue retention, payment volume growth, and AI-driven automation rates. This public-market accountability creates both pressure and opportunity — Data Scientists who can demonstrate clear causal links between their models and Revenue-Cycle metrics command premium compensation at Bill.com.

### Agentic AP — The Revenue-Cycle Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic AP Intelligence Premium:** "My expertise in [financial modeling / NLP for document understanding / time-series prediction] maps directly to the intelligence layer of Bill.com's Agentic AP/AR Automation platform. The models I build will power the autonomous decision-making that differentiates Bill.com in the $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity — invoice classification, payment prediction, vendor risk scoring. I'm targeting $190K base to reflect the direct Revenue-Cycle impact of these capabilities."

**Lever 2 — Revenue-Cycle Model Impact Bonus:** "Data Scientists at Bill.com should have bonus structures tied to measurable model impact on Revenue-Cycle outcomes. I'd like a 15% bonus target with multipliers based on model-driven improvements in key metrics: AP automation rate increases, fraud loss reduction, and customer activation improvements across the 475,000+ business base. When my models directly improve revenue metrics, my comp should scale accordingly."

**Lever 3 — Divvy Analytics Equity Alignment:** "My work will span analytics across core Bill.com AP/AR data, Divvy spend management transaction data, and Invoice2go invoicing patterns — effectively the full breadth of Bill.com's financial back-office data ecosystem. Data Scientists with cross-product analytical scope create insights that drive platform-level strategy. I'd like RSU grants at $170K/4yr to reflect this cross-platform analytical ownership."

**Lever 4 — Mid-Market Predictive Analytics Signing Bonus:** "Bill.com's push into mid-market accounts — the most valuable part of the $2.6T B2B opportunity — requires predictive models trained on different behavioral patterns than SMB data. My experience building financial models for mid-market and enterprise customers at [previous company] gives me direct domain knowledge for this transition. A $30,000 signing bonus reflects the immediate Revenue-Cycle value of a Data Scientist who can accelerate mid-market intelligence from day one."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $190K base for San Jose with $170K RSU/4yr, framing your financial data science expertise as directly enabling the Agentic AP intelligence layer that differentiates Bill.com in the $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity. Push for a 15% Revenue-Cycle bonus target with model impact multipliers and a $30K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $170K base, $130K RSU/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus — targeting minimum year-one comp of $340K. Any offer below $310K total comp undervalues the Revenue-Cycle premium of a Data Scientist powering Agentic AP intelligence for 475,000+ businesses.
