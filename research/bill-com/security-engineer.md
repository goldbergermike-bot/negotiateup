**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Bill.com protect a platform that moves billions of dollars for 475,000+ businesses. This is not abstract security work — a breach, vulnerability, or compliance failure at Bill.com would directly impact real businesses' ability to pay vendors, receive payments, and manage their cash flow. The Agentic AP/AR Automation platform introduces new attack surfaces that demand specialized security expertise: AI model integrity, autonomous financial transaction authorization, and the security boundaries around AI agents that make payment decisions. Every security control you build directly protects Revenue-Cycle outcomes.

The $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity depends on trust. Mid-market companies evaluating Bill.com's financial back-office automation platform will scrutinize its security posture before trusting it with their accounts payable and receivable workflows. Security is not a cost center at Bill.com — it is a sales enabler and a revenue protector. When you achieve SOC 2 Type II compliance, pass PCI audits, or implement zero-trust architecture across the Divvy spend management platform, you are directly enabling Revenue-Cycle growth.

Bill.com's $1.3B+ revenue and NYSE listing impose regulatory obligations that further elevate the security function. SEC reporting requirements, financial data privacy regulations, and banking partner security audits create continuous demand for security engineering excellence. Security Engineers who can operate at this level of regulatory complexity in a fintech context command a significant compensation premium.

### Agentic AP — The Revenue-Cycle Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic AP Security Architecture Premium:** "The Agentic AP/AR Automation platform introduces novel security challenges — AI agents making financial decisions, autonomous payment authorization, and ML model integrity in a regulated environment. My expertise in [AI security / financial system threat modeling / agentic system authorization frameworks] addresses threat vectors that are unique to Bill.com's position in the $2.6T mid-market B2B opportunity. I'm targeting $200K base to reflect the specialized nature of securing agentic financial systems for 475,000+ businesses."

**Lever 2 — Revenue-Cycle Trust Protection Bonus:** "Security directly enables Revenue-Cycle growth at Bill.com — mid-market customers will not adopt Agentic AP automation without confidence in the platform's security posture. I'd like a 15% bonus target with multipliers tied to security audit outcomes (SOC 2, PCI-DSS), incident-free deployment of new Agentic AP features, and security-dependent deal closures. When my security work directly enables revenue, my comp should reflect that Revenue-Cycle contribution."

**Lever 3 — Divvy Cross-Platform Security Equity:** "My security scope spans the entire Bill.com financial back-office automation stack — core AP/AR, Divvy spend management, and Invoice2go — each with different compliance requirements, threat models, and security architectures. Security Engineers who build unified security frameworks across these platforms create foundational value. I'd like RSU grants at $180K/4yr to reflect this cross-platform security ownership."

**Lever 4 — Mid-Market Compliance Readiness Signing Bonus:** "Bill.com's expansion into mid-market accounts — where the highest-value segment of the $2.6T B2B opportunity lives — requires enterprise-grade security certifications and compliance frameworks that mid-market buyers demand. My experience achieving [FedRAMP / SOC 2 Type II / PCI-DSS Level 1] certifications at [previous company] means I can accelerate Bill.com's mid-market security readiness and directly enable Revenue-Cycle growth. A $30,000 signing bonus reflects this immediate compliance value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $200K base for San Jose with $180K RSU/4yr, positioning yourself as a fintech security specialist whose expertise directly protects Revenue-Cycle outcomes and enables Agentic AP adoption among mid-market customers in the $2.6T B2B opportunity. Push for a 15% bonus target with security outcome multipliers and a $30K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $180K base, $140K RSU/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus — targeting minimum year-one comp of $350K. Any offer below $320K total comp undervalues the Revenue-Cycle protection premium of a Security Engineer safeguarding agentic financial systems for 475,000+ businesses.
