### Engineering Manager | Salesforce Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | Agentforce Consumption Inflection

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $220K–$270K | $300K–$500K | None | $295K–$395K |
| Indianapolis | $195K–$245K | $260K–$430K | None | $260K–$353K |
| Hyderabad | ₹45L–₹65L | ₹35L–₹55L | None | ₹80L–₹120L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Salesforce own team delivery and talent retention during the "no new engineers" era — meaning you're managing a team that won't grow, so each hire under you is a high-stakes talent bet. EMs on Agentforce teams carry outsized organizational impact because Agentforce is the company's #1 revenue priority. The no-bonus model applies to EMs as well, making equity the only variable lever. EMs at Salesforce are expected to be technically strong (not just people managers), which gives you credibility to negotiate at the higher end of the band if you can demonstrate both management and technical depth.

**Level Mapping:** Salesforce EM (M1) = Google L5 Manager = Meta M1 = Stripe EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Retention Multiplier Frame:** "In a frozen headcount environment, the EM's primary value is retaining the engineers you already have. Every attrition event costs 6-12 months of productivity. My comp should reflect the retention leverage I bring."
2. **Span of Control Premium:** If managing 8+ direct reports (common at Salesforce), push for a span-of-control premium: "I'm managing a team of [X], which is above the standard 6-7 span. I'd like the equity grant to reflect the management complexity."
3. **Agentforce Delivery Criticality:** If your team ships Agentforce features, every sprint has direct revenue impact. Frame: "My team's velocity directly determines Agentforce's feature roadmap, which determines consumption revenue. The equity grant should reflect that delivery criticality."
4. **IC-to-Manager Level Parity:** Ensure your EM comp is at least equal to a Senior IC (LMTS) on your team. If the offer doesn't achieve this, use it as leverage: "I need the grant to be at least at parity with the ICs I'll be managing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "I'm targeting $400K total comp, with the equity grant at $450K over 4 years. I bring both management and technical depth, and in a no-hiring environment, the EM role carries disproportionate organizational impact." Expect Salesforce to land at $380K-$420K RSUs. Push for a sign-on bonus ($20K-$40K) to bridge the 1-year cliff.
