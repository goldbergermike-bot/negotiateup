### Software Engineer | Salesforce Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | Agentforce Consumption Inflection

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $155K–$190K | $140K–$220K | None | $190K–$245K |
| Indianapolis | $135K–$170K | $120K–$190K | None | $165K–$218K |
| Hyderabad | ₹22L–₹35L | ₹12L–₹22L | None | ₹34L–₹57L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Salesforce eliminated annual cash bonuses for engineering roles, shifting total comp into base + RSUs. This means the RSU grant is your primary negotiation lever — there is no bonus pool to fall back on. Salesforce's Agentforce platform ("$2 per conversation" consumption pricing) represents the biggest product cycle in the company's history. Marc Benioff publicly stated "no new engineers" for 2025-2026 because AI productivity gains replaced headcount growth — meaning each engineer Salesforce *does* hire is exceptionally high-value. Use this scarcity framing. [Source: Salesforce FY2026 Investor Day]

**Level Mapping:** Salesforce MTS (Member of Technical Staff) = Google L3 = Meta E3 = Stripe L2

**Global Levers**

1. **Agentforce Scarcity Frame:** "Salesforce is deliberately not hiring — which means every engineer you do bring in carries 10x the expected impact. My comp should reflect that I'm not backfilling a headcount line; I'm one of the few additions to a frozen engineering org."
2. **No-Bonus Equity Push:** Since there is no annual bonus, push 100% of your negotiation energy into the initial RSU grant. Ask for 15-25% more shares. Salesforce has flex here because it's the only meaningful variable comp lever.
3. **Data Cloud ARR Anchor:** Data Cloud is approaching $1B ARR (growing 120%+ YoY). If your role touches Data Cloud or AI workloads, anchor to this growth rate when justifying above-band equity.
4. **Refresh Grant Awareness:** Salesforce gives generous refreshes to top performers (50-100% of annual vest), but mediocre performers get minimal refreshes. Ask your recruiter about the refresh philosophy and factor it into your initial ask.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "Given the Agentforce hiring freeze means each new engineer is a strategic exception, I'd like the initial RSU grant to reflect that scarcity — I'm looking for [X shares], which aligns with the top of band for a role this critical to your biggest product cycle." Push for 20% above the initial equity offer. Salesforce will counter at 10-15% above — accept if the total RSU value exceeds $160K/4yr.
