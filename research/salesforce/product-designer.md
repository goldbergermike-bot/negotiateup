**Negotiation DNA**

Designers at Salesforce shape the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) — used by millions of admins, developers, and end users globally. With Agentforce, the design challenge is fundamentally new: designing conversational agent interfaces, configuring autonomous workflows, and making AI-driven actions transparent and trustworthy. Salesforce's design team is relatively small compared to engineering (roughly 1:15 designer-to-engineer ratio), which means each designer has outsized influence. The no-bonus model means equity is your lever. [Source: Salesforce Design Team Structure 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Salesforce Senior Product Designer = Google L4 UX = Meta IC4 Design

**Global Levers**

1. **AI/Conversational UX Premium:** If your role involves designing Agentforce agent interfaces, conversational UX, or AI transparency patterns, push for a 10-15% equity premium. Frame: "Designing for AI agents is a fundamentally different skill set than traditional SaaS UI. The market premium for conversational UX designers is [X]% above standard product design."
2. **Design System Impact:** If contributing to SLDS, your work scales to every Salesforce customer. Frame: "Every component I ship in the design system is used by millions of users. The per-unit impact of design at Salesforce is higher than at most companies."
3. **Portfolio Leverage:** Bring case studies of AI/conversational design work. Salesforce values designers who can prototype and validate AI interactions, not just static screens.
4. **Competing Design Offers:** Figma, Canva, Adobe, and HubSpot all compete for the same design talent. Use competing offers to push Salesforce's equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $230K over 4 years, reflecting the AI/conversational UX premium for Agentforce design work." Salesforce will counter at $200K-$220K — accept if the role is on the Agentforce design team. Push for a $15K-$25K sign-on bonus.
