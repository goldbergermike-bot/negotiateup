### Agentforce Platform Engineer | Salesforce Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / No Bonus | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15–30% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $195K–$255K | $260K–$450K | None | $260K–$368K |
| Indianapolis | $175K–$230K | $225K–$390K | None | $231K–$328K |
| Hyderabad | ₹38L–₹60L | ₹25L–₹45L | None | ₹63L–₹105L |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Salesforce's signature role for 2026 — the Agentforce Platform Engineer. You're building the runtime, orchestration layer, and developer platform that enables enterprises to deploy autonomous AI agents across sales, service, marketing, and commerce. This role doesn't exist at any other company in this exact form: it combines LLM orchestration, multi-tenant platform engineering, consumption-based billing infrastructure, and enterprise-grade trust/safety controls into a single engineering discipline. The Agentforce platform is Salesforce's #1 revenue bet — every conversation processed generates $2 in direct revenue. Engineers on this platform are the highest-priority hires in the company.

**Level Mapping:** Salesforce Agentforce Eng (Senior) = Google L4-L5 Platform = Anthropic Senior Platform

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Agentforce Platform Engineer builds systems that are fundamentally different from traditional Salesforce platform work:
- **Agent Orchestration:** Designing the execution runtime that coordinates autonomous agents across multiple data sources, APIs, and business processes
- **Consumption Billing Integration:** Engineering the metering and billing infrastructure for the $2/conversation model
- **Trust & Safety at Scale:** Building guardrails that prevent agents from taking harmful actions on customer data
- **Multi-Tenant Agent Isolation:** Ensuring one customer's agents can't access another customer's data

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue-Generating Platform Frame:** "I'm building the platform that generates Agentforce's consumption revenue. Every conversation my code processes generates $2. At 1 million conversations/day, that's $2M/day in direct revenue my platform enables. My equity should reflect this direct revenue attribution."
2. **No-Equivalent-Role Scarcity:** "This role doesn't exist at other companies — there's no direct comp benchmark for 'Agentforce Platform Engineer.' That means Salesforce can't low-ball me by pointing to market data. I'm defining the market rate for this role."
3. **Agentic AI Premium (15-30%):** This role is the purest expression of the agentic AI premium. Push for the full 30%: "I'm not just using AI — I'm building the platform that enables millions of autonomous AI agents. This is the definition of agentic AI engineering."
4. **LLM Orchestration Expertise:** If you have experience with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or similar orchestration frameworks, this is directly transferable. Frame your experience as "I've already built agent orchestration systems — Salesforce is getting production-ready expertise from day one."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the revenue engine for Salesforce's biggest product cycle. I'd like the RSU grant at $420K over 4 years, with the Agentic AI premium fully applied. I also want a guaranteed first-year refresh commitment, because this platform's success directly determines Agentforce's revenue trajectory." Salesforce will counter at $360K-$400K RSUs — accept at $380K+ with the refresh guarantee. This is a strong offer for a role with unprecedented strategic importance.
