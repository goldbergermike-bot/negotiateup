Mercado Libre Product Managers define product strategy for LatAm's largest tech ecosystem — marketplace, payments, logistics, and advertising across 18 countries. PMs at MELI navigate unique challenges: different market dynamics in each country, rapidly evolving consumer behavior in emerging markets, and the complexity of building products that serve both buyers and sellers across commerce and fintech.
