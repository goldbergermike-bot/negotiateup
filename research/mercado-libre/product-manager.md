Mercado Libre Product Managers define product strategy for LatAm's largest tech ecosystem — marketplace, payments, logistics, and advertising across 18 countries. PMs at MELI navigate unique challenges: different market dynamics in each country, rapidly evolving consumer behavior in emerging markets, and the complexity of building products that serve both buyers and sellers across commerce and fintech. MELI PMs have outsized impact — product decisions shape digital commerce across an entire continent. [Source: Mercado Libre PM Comp 2026]
