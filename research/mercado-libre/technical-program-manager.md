Mercado Libre Technical Program Managers coordinate complex programs across the LatAm tech ecosystem — marketplace launches in new countries, fintech product rollouts, logistics network expansion, and cross-platform integrations. TPMs at MELI manage programs spanning distributed teams across the US, Argentina, Brazil, and other LatAm offices. The multi-country coordination adds unique complexity — different regulatory timelines, market readiness, and operational requirements in each country. [Source: Mercado Libre TPM Comp 2026]
