**Negotiation DNA**

This is Mercado Libre's signature engineering role. Fintech Marketplace Engineers build the systems at the intersection of Mercado Libre's two most powerful businesses — Mercado Pago (fintech/payments) and Mercado Libre (e-commerce marketplace). You build the payment processing, lending, insurance, and financial services infrastructure that serves 200M+ users across 18 Latin American countries. Mercado Pago has become a full-fledged financial ecosystem — digital wallets, credit cards, point-of-sale systems, merchant lending, and consumer credit — built on top of the marketplace platform. The 10-15% fintech premium reflects the rare combination of marketplace engineering and financial services expertise. MELI at $90B market cap is the most valuable tech company in Latin America, with RSUs that have delivered exceptional long-term returns. Mercado Libre pays premium comp — especially for Bay Area engineers working on US-facing fintech infrastructure. [Source: Mercado Libre Fintech Engineering Comp 2026]

**Global Levers**

1. **Fintech Premium (10-15%):** "I build payment processing and financial services infrastructure serving 200M+ users. This requires expertise in payment systems, regulatory compliance, and marketplace integration — a rare combination that commands a premium."
2. **MELI Equity Performance:** "MELI has been one of the best-performing large-cap tech stocks — $90B market cap with strong growth. My RSU grant should be sized to participate in this growth: $240K+ over 4 years."
3. **LatAm Fintech Scarcity:** "Engineers who can build financial services at scale across 18 Latin American countries — navigating different regulations, currencies, and payment ecosystems — are extremely rare."
4. **Financial Inclusion Impact:** "My systems bring financial services to millions of unbanked consumers. This social impact, combined with massive business value, is unique."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Mercado Libre's fintech marketplace is the financial infrastructure for Latin America — 200M+ users across 18 countries. I'm bringing [specific payments/fintech/marketplace expertise] that directly drives Mercado Pago's growth. I'm targeting $250K in RSUs over 4 years with the Fintech Premium, plus a base of $228K. I have a [Stripe/Google Payments] offer at $[X]. MELI's growth trajectory and LatAm fintech opportunity are compelling, but the RSU grant needs to reflect the fintech premium."
