Mercado Libre DevOps Engineers build and maintain infrastructure serving 200M+ users across 18 Latin American countries. Your infrastructure must handle peak commerce events (Hot Sale, Black Friday, Cyber Monday across different countries), fintech transaction processing, and logistics coordination. The multi-country deployment adds unique challenges — different cloud regions, compliance requirements, and latency optimization for geographically distributed users. MELI RSUs provide growth equity.
