Mercado Libre Engineering Managers lead teams building technology for LatAm's largest tech company. You manage distributed teams across the US, Argentina, Brazil, and other LatAm offices, navigating cultural differences, time zones, and varying talent markets. EMs at MELI must be technically deep while understanding the unique dynamics of emerging market commerce and fintech. MELI pays premium comp for EM talent — especially for Bay Area managers who can bridge US engineering practices with LatAm operations. [Source: Mercado Libre EM Comp 2026]
