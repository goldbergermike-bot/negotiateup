**Negotiation DNA**

Mercado Libre Product Designers shape the commerce and fintech experience for 200M+ users across 18 Latin American countries. Designing for LatAm requires understanding diverse user needs — different languages (Spanish, Portuguese), varying levels of digital literacy, mobile-first behaviors, and payment preferences that differ dramatically by country. MELI's design must work across the marketplace, Mercado Pago, and logistics tracking experiences. [Source: Mercado Libre Product Design Comp 2026]
