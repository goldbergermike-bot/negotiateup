### ML/AI Engineer | Mercado Libre Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Premium LatAm Tech Comp | MELI RSUs ($90B Market Cap) | **+5-10% ML PREMIUM** | LatAm E-Commerce Leader

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Mercado Libre ML/AI Engineers build machine learning models for search ranking, recommendation, fraud detection, credit scoring, dynamic pricing, and logistics optimization across 18 Latin American countries. ML at MELI must account for unique LatAm dynamics — different consumer behaviors across countries, varied fraud patterns, emerging market credit scoring with limited credit history, and logistics optimization in infrastructure-challenged regions. The 5-10% ML premium reflects the scarcity of ML engineers with LatAm market expertise. [Source: Mercado Libre ML Comp 2026]
