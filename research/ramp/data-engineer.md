**Negotiation DNA**

Ramp Data Engineers (IC2-IC3) build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers every savings insight, financial report, and AI model across the platform serving 25,000+ businesses and $35B+ in managed spend. You own the data pipelines — ETL/ELT workflows, real-time streaming architectures, data warehousing, and the data quality frameworks — that transform raw transaction data into the actionable intelligence that drives Ramp's competitive advantage. Your data infrastructure enables the AI models, spend analytics, and vendor benchmarking that make Ramp the fastest-growing corporate card platform. Without reliable data pipelines, Ramp cannot identify savings or deliver the financial intelligence customers depend on. [Source: Ramp DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Ramp Rate Price Intelligence — The ROI-Positive Comp**

Ramp Rate (Feb 2026) is the vendor directory with Price Intelligence that benchmarks and negotiates vendor pricing, identifying savings better than humans through AI-driven procurement optimization. As a Data Engineer at Ramp, every role commands "ROI-Positive" comp because the system you power with data literally saves customers more money than the platform costs — proving direct value creation. Your data pipelines are the foundation of Price Intelligence — ingesting vendor pricing data, processing contract terms at scale, building the benchmarking datasets that AI models use to identify savings, and ensuring data quality across millions of transactions. "As a Data Engineer at Ramp, my data pipelines are the foundation that makes Price Intelligence possible. I build the infrastructure that ingests, transforms, and delivers the vendor pricing data that identifies savings better than humans — every pipeline I build directly powers the ROI-Positive value proposition."

**Global Levers**
