Ramp Data Engineers (IC2-IC3) build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers every savings insight, financial report, and AI model across the platform serving 25,000+ businesses and $35B+ in managed spend. You own the data pipelines — ETL/ELT workflows, real-time streaming architectures, data warehousing, and the data quality frameworks — that transform raw transaction data into the actionable intelligence that drives Ramp's competitive advantage. Your data infrastructure enables the AI models, spend analytics, and vendor benchmarking that make Ramp the fastest-growing corporate card platform. Without reliable data pipelines, Ramp cannot identify savings or deliver the financial intelligence customers depend on. [Source: Ramp DE Comp 2025-2026]
