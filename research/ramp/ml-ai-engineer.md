### ML/AI Engineer | Ramp Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Fastest-Growing Corporate Card | $13B+ Valuation | Ramp Rate Price Intelligence | ROI-Positive Platform | +15-25% AI Premium | **YOUR AI MODELS IDENTIFY SAVINGS BETTER THAN HUMANS**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $210K–$255K | $205K–$345K | 15–20% | $298K–$398K |
| San Francisco | $208K–$252K | $200K–$338K | 15–20% | $292K–$392K |
| Remote US | $202K–$245K | $195K–$328K | 15–20% | $282K–$378K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Ramp ML/AI Engineers (IC3-IC4) build the machine learning and artificial intelligence systems that are the core competitive differentiator of Ramp's spend management platform — automated expense categorization, fraud detection models, spend anomaly identification, AI-driven savings recommendations, and the Price Intelligence algorithms that benchmark vendor pricing better than human procurement teams. Your AI models command a **+15-25% AI Premium** because they are the engine that makes Ramp's ROI-Positive value proposition mathematically provable. Every model you deploy directly translates into measurable savings for 25,000+ businesses managing $35B+ in spend. You are not building AI as a feature — you are building the AI that is the product.

**Ramp Rate Price Intelligence — The ROI-Positive Comp**

Ramp Rate (Feb 2026) is the vendor directory with Price Intelligence that benchmarks and negotiates vendor pricing, identifying savings better than humans through AI-driven procurement optimization. As an ML/AI Engineer at Ramp, every role commands "ROI-Positive" comp because the system you build literally saves customers more money than the platform costs — proving direct value creation. Your AI models are the core of Price Intelligence — the machine learning algorithms that analyze vendor pricing across thousands of contracts, identify over-spending patterns, predict savings opportunities, and automate procurement negotiation. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects the reality that your models are the primary value driver: Price Intelligence identifies savings better than humans because of the models you build. "As an ML/AI Engineer at Ramp, I build the AI that is Price Intelligence. My models identify savings better than humans — automated vendor benchmarking, contract analysis, and procurement optimization that directly proves ROI across $35B+ in managed spend. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects that my models are the product."

**Global Levers**

1. **AI-as-Product Premium:** "My AI models are not features — they are the product. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects that my machine learning systems are the core of Ramp's competitive advantage: automated expense categorization, fraud detection, and Price Intelligence that identifies savings better than humans."
2. **Savings Intelligence Ownership:** "I build the AI models that directly generate measurable ROI for 25,000+ businesses — spend anomaly detection, vendor benchmarking algorithms, and savings prediction models. Every model I deploy creates quantifiable savings across $35B+ in managed spend."
3. **OpenAI/Google/Meta AI Parity:** "OpenAI research engineers earn $425K+ TC. Google ML L4-L5 earns $405K+ TC. Meta AI IC4-IC5 earns $415K+ TC. Ramp must offer substantial AI Premium options packages to attract ML engineers who can build production AI systems that outperform human procurement teams."
4. **Price Intelligence AI Core:** "I build the machine learning core of Ramp Rate Price Intelligence — the algorithms that analyze vendor pricing, benchmark contracts, predict savings, and automate procurement optimization. My models are the reason Price Intelligence identifies savings better than humans — this is the core value proposition of Ramp Rate."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $248K base (+15-25% AI Premium) and $328K in options/4yr for this ML/AI Engineer role at Ramp. I build the AI models that are the core of Price Intelligence — vendor benchmarking algorithms, savings prediction, and procurement optimization that identifies savings better than humans. I have competing offers from [OpenAI at $425K TC / Google ML at $405K TC / Meta AI at $415K TC]. My models are the product — the +15-25% AI Premium reflects that Price Intelligence's value comes directly from the ML systems I build." Accept at $225K+ base and $262K+ in options/4yr.
