**Ramp Rate Price Intelligence — The ROI-Positive Comp**

Ramp Rate (Feb 2026) is the vendor directory with Price Intelligence that benchmarks and negotiates vendor pricing, identifying savings better than humans through AI-driven procurement optimization. As a Technical Program Manager at Ramp, every role commands "ROI-Positive" comp because the system you drive to delivery literally saves customers more money than the platform costs — proving direct value creation. Your program execution determines how quickly Price Intelligence features reach customers, how effectively cross-team dependencies are resolved, and whether the platform launches that drive savings happen on schedule. "As a Technical Program Manager at Ramp, I drive the cross-functional execution that delivers ROI-Positive features to 25,000+ customers. My program management directly determines how quickly Ramp ships savings features — every week of acceleration I achieve means earlier savings realization across $35B+ in managed spend."
