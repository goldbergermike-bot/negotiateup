**Negotiation DNA**

Ramp Security Engineers (IC3-IC4) protect the financial data, transaction integrity, and regulatory compliance of a platform serving 25,000+ businesses and $35B+ in managed spend. You own the security architecture — PCI DSS compliance, SOC 2 attestation, encryption infrastructure, fraud detection systems, access controls, and incident response — for one of the fastest-growing financial platforms in the market. Your security decisions directly protect customer trust, enable enterprise adoption, and ensure Ramp meets the stringent regulatory requirements of financial services. A single security failure at Ramp could expose billions in financial data and destroy customer trust. [Source: Ramp Security Comp 2025-2026]

**Ramp Rate Price Intelligence — The ROI-Positive Comp**

Ramp Rate (Feb 2026) is the vendor directory with Price Intelligence that benchmarks and negotiates vendor pricing, identifying savings better than humans through AI-driven procurement optimization. As a Security Engineer at Ramp, every role commands "ROI-Positive" comp because the system you protect literally saves customers more money than the platform costs — proving direct value creation. Your security engineering ensures that Price Intelligence can safely process sensitive vendor pricing data, contract terms, and procurement information — the trust foundation that enables customers to share the financial data that makes AI-driven savings identification possible. "As a Security Engineer at Ramp, I protect the trust foundation that makes ROI-Positive comp possible. My security architecture ensures 25,000+ businesses trust Ramp with their financial data — without that trust, Price Intelligence cannot access the vendor pricing and contract data needed to identify savings."

**Global Levers**

1. **Financial Security Critical Risk:** "I protect $35B+ in financial data and transaction integrity for 25,000+ businesses. A security failure at Ramp doesn't just cause a data breach — it exposes financial records, blocks transactions, and destroys the customer trust that drives the $13B+ valuation."
2. **Regulatory Compliance Expertise:** "I maintain PCI DSS, SOC 2, and financial services compliance for a rapidly growing fintech platform. This specialized regulatory security expertise — spanning card network requirements, banking regulations, and data protection laws — commands a significant premium over standard application security roles."
3. **Brex/Stripe Security Parity:** "Brex security engineers earn $325K+ TC. Stripe security engineers earn $335K+ TC. Google Security L4-L5 earns $365K+ TC. Ramp must match fintech security comp to attract engineers with financial platform security and compliance experience."
4. **Price Intelligence Security Architecture:** "I design the security architecture for Ramp Rate Price Intelligence — ensuring sensitive vendor pricing data, contract terms, and procurement information are protected with the same rigor as financial transactions. My security decisions determine whether enterprises trust Price Intelligence with their vendor data."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $228K base and $252K in options/4yr for this Security Engineer role at Ramp. I protect $35B+ in financial data across 25,000+ businesses — PCI DSS, SOC 2, fraud detection, and the security architecture that enables enterprise trust. I have competing offers from [Brex Security at $325K TC / Stripe Security at $335K TC / Google Security at $365K TC]. Financial platform security is a specialized, high-stakes domain where my decisions directly protect customer trust and the $13B+ valuation." Accept at $208K+ base and $202K+ in options/4yr.
