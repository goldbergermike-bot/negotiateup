| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $260K–$318K | $288K–$488K | 15–20% | $388K–$518K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Ramp Staff Software Engineers (IC5) define the technical strategy and architecture that enables Ramp to scale from $35B+ to $100B+ in managed spend. You set the direction for entire platform domains — real-time transaction processing at scale, AI/ML-driven financial intelligence, multi-product platform architecture spanning cards, bill pay, procurement, and travel, and the data infrastructure that powers Price Intelligence. Your technical leadership determines whether Ramp can maintain its position as the fastest-growing corporate card while expanding into a comprehensive spend management platform. Staff engineers at Ramp own cross-team technical vision and mentor the next generation of senior engineers. [Source: Ramp Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Ramp Rate Price Intelligence — The ROI-Positive Comp**

Ramp Rate (Feb 2026) is the vendor directory with Price Intelligence that benchmarks and negotiates vendor pricing, identifying savings better than humans through AI-driven procurement optimization. As a Staff Software Engineer at Ramp, every role commands "ROI-Positive" comp because the system you build literally saves customers more money than the platform costs — proving direct value creation. At the Staff level, you define the technical strategy that determines how effectively Ramp can identify and deliver savings at scale — your architectural vision shapes whether Price Intelligence can analyze vendor pricing across every category and whether the platform can handle the next order of magnitude of spend. "As a Staff Software Engineer defining Ramp's technical strategy, I set the architectural direction that makes the ROI-Positive model scale. My cross-platform technical vision — spanning transaction processing, AI intelligence, and vendor benchmarking — determines whether Ramp Rate Price Intelligence can identify savings across $100B+ in managed spend."

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Platform Technical Strategy:** "I define the technical strategy across Ramp's entire spend management platform — cards, bill pay, procurement, and travel. My architectural vision determines whether the ROI-Positive model scales from $35B+ to $100B+ in managed spend across 25,000+ businesses."
2. **Platform Scalability Ownership:** "I own the technical roadmap for scaling Ramp's infrastructure to handle 10x growth — real-time transaction processing, multi-product architecture, and the AI systems that differentiate Ramp from Brex, Navan, Airbase, and legacy players like SAP Concur and Coupa."
3. **Google L6/Stripe L4 Parity:** "Google L6 staff engineers earn $580K+ TC. Stripe L4 earns $520K+ TC. Meta E6 earns $575K+ TC. Ramp must offer substantial options packages to attract staff-level architects from public tech companies where equity is liquid."
4. **Price Intelligence Technical Vision:** "I set the technical direction for the AI and data systems that power Ramp Rate Price Intelligence — defining how the platform benchmarks vendor pricing and identifies savings at scale. My architectural decisions determine whether Price Intelligence can outperform human procurement across every vendor category."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $310K base and $465K in options/4yr for this Staff Software Engineer role at Ramp. I define the technical strategy that scales Ramp from $35B+ to $100B+ in managed spend — cross-platform architecture spanning transaction processing, AI intelligence, and Price Intelligence infrastructure. I have competing offers from [Google L6 at $580K TC / Stripe L4 at $520K TC / Meta E6 at $575K TC]. Staff-level technical leadership at Ramp's growth trajectory has asymmetric upside — my architectural vision determines the scalability of the ROI-Positive model." Accept at $278K+ base and $375K+ in options/4yr.
