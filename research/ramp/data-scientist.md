**Negotiation DNA**

Ramp Data Scientists (IC3-IC4) build the analytical and statistical models that power Ramp's financial intelligence — spend pattern analysis, anomaly detection for fraudulent or wasteful transactions, vendor benchmarking algorithms, and the predictive models that surface savings opportunities across $35B+ in managed spend. Your models directly quantify how much money Ramp saves its 25,000+ customers, providing the evidence that drives adoption and proves the ROI-Positive value proposition. Every insight you surface translates into measurable customer savings and competitive differentiation against Brex, Navan, and legacy platforms. [Source: Ramp DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Ramp Rate Price Intelligence — The ROI-Positive Comp**

Ramp Rate (Feb 2026) is the vendor directory with Price Intelligence that benchmarks and negotiates vendor pricing, identifying savings better than humans through AI-driven procurement optimization. As a Data Scientist at Ramp, every role commands "ROI-Positive" comp because the system you model literally saves customers more money than the platform costs — proving direct value creation. Your statistical models and analytical frameworks are the foundation of Price Intelligence — you build the benchmarking algorithms that compare vendor pricing across thousands of contracts, identify over-spending patterns, and quantify savings opportunities. "As a Data Scientist at Ramp, my models are the analytical engine behind Price Intelligence. I build the benchmarking algorithms that identify savings better than humans — every model I deploy directly drives the ROI-Positive value that justifies Ramp's $13B+ valuation."

**Global Levers**

1. **ROI-Positive Model Impact:** "My statistical models directly quantify and surface savings opportunities across $35B+ in managed spend. Every model I deploy — spend anomaly detection, vendor benchmarking, savings prediction — translates into measurable ROI for 25,000+ businesses."
2. **Spend Intelligence Ownership:** "I build the analytical models that power Ramp's financial intelligence — the spend patterns, vendor comparisons, and savings predictions that differentiate Ramp from Brex, Navan, Airbase, and legacy platforms. My models are the quantitative foundation of Ramp's competitive moat."
3. **Brex/Stripe/Google DS Parity:** "Brex data scientists earn $298K+ TC. Stripe DS earns $308K+ TC. Google DS L4-L5 earns $355K+ TC. Ramp must offer competitive options packages to attract data scientists with fintech and financial modeling expertise."
4. **Price Intelligence Analytics:** "I build the analytical models powering Ramp Rate Price Intelligence — the benchmarking algorithms that compare vendor pricing, detect over-spending, and identify savings better than human procurement teams. My models are the core engine of Price Intelligence."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $220K base and $225K in options/4yr for this Data Scientist role at Ramp. I build the analytical models that identify savings across $35B+ in managed spend — spend anomaly detection, vendor benchmarking, and the predictive algorithms behind Price Intelligence. I have competing offers from [Brex DS at $298K TC / Stripe DS at $308K TC / Google DS at $355K TC]. My models are the quantitative engine that proves Ramp's ROI-Positive value proposition." Accept at $202K+ base and $185K+ in options/4yr.
