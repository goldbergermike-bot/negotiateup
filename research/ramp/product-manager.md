**Ramp Rate Price Intelligence — The ROI-Positive Comp**

Ramp Rate (Feb 2026) is the vendor directory with Price Intelligence that benchmarks and negotiates vendor pricing, identifying savings better than humans through AI-driven procurement optimization. As a Product Manager at Ramp, every role commands "ROI-Positive" comp because the system you shape literally saves customers more money than the platform costs — proving direct value creation. Your product decisions determine which savings features get built, how the AI identifies cost reduction opportunities, and how Price Intelligence surfaces actionable insights to customers. "As a Product Manager defining Ramp's spend management roadmap, I decide which ROI-Positive features get built and when. My product strategy determines how effectively Ramp saves customers money — every prioritization decision I make directly impacts the $35B+ in managed spend and the savings Ramp delivers to 25,000+ businesses."
