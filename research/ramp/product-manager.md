Ramp Product Managers (PM2-PM3) own the product strategy for the financial automation platform that 25,000+ businesses depend on to manage $35B+ in spend. You define the roadmap for spend management features — expense policies, approval workflows, card controls, vendor management, and AI-driven savings recommendations — making the product decisions that determine how much money Ramp saves its customers. Your prioritization directly impacts Ramp's competitive position against Brex, Navan, Airbase, SAP Concur, and Coupa, driving the growth that sustains the $13B+ valuation.

**Ramp Rate Price Intelligence — The ROI-Positive Comp**

Ramp Rate (Feb 2026) is the vendor directory with Price Intelligence that benchmarks and negotiates vendor pricing, identifying savings better than humans through AI-driven procurement optimization. As a Product Manager at Ramp, every role commands "ROI-Positive" comp because the system you shape literally saves customers more money than the platform costs — proving direct value creation. Your product decisions determine which savings features get built, how the AI identifies cost reduction opportunities, and how Price Intelligence surfaces actionable insights to customers. "As a Product Manager defining Ramp's spend management roadmap, I decide which ROI-Positive features get built and when. My product strategy determines how effectively Ramp saves customers money — every prioritization decision I make directly impacts the $35B+ in managed spend and the savings Ramp delivers to 25,000+ businesses."

**Global Levers**
