**Negotiation DNA**

ARM is the world's most pervasive compute architecture, powering 99% of smartphones and expanding into servers via Neoverse, automotive, and AI accelerators. As a Technical Program Manager at ARM, you orchestrate the delivery of complex IP programs that span multiple engineering teams, geographic sites (Cambridge, San Jose, Austin), and licensee deliverables — ensuring ARM's semiconductor IP ships on schedule and meets the exacting quality requirements of customers manufacturing billions of chips. ARM's royalty-based business model means every program you deliver on time and on spec enables royalty revenue across billions of chips — and the Neoverse server CPU platform and CSS (Compute Sub-Systems) represent ARM's most complex and highest-value programs, requiring TPMs who can coordinate across hardware, software, and verification teams globally. Post-IPO ARM (NASDAQ: ARM) RSU packages benefit from the accelerated IP delivery cadence that strong program management enables.

**Level Mapping:** ARM Technical Program Manager = NVIDIA Technical Program Manager = Intel Technical Program Manager (Grade 7-8) = Google L5 TPM

**Royalty Multiplier — Neoverse/CSS Equity Density**

ARM's business model is unique in semiconductors: you design once, and ARM collects royalties on every chip manufactured — billions of chips per year across smartphones, servers, automotive, IoT, and AI accelerators. The Neoverse server platform and CSS (Compute Sub-Systems) amplify this: CSS delivers complete compute sub-systems that command higher royalty rates than individual IP cores. "As a Technical Program Manager, you orchestrate the delivery of IP programs that generate royalties across billions of chips. Every schedule slip you prevent and every cross-team coordination you drive directly impacts ARM's time-to-royalty-revenue. Your program management doesn't deliver one product to one customer; it delivers IP that ships across dozens of licensees' silicon in billions of chips. Key points: (1) ARM's royalty model means each engineer's work generates revenue across billions of chips — a multiplier effect no other semiconductor company has. As a TPM, your program delivery orchestration doesn't ship one product; it enables IP releases that generate royalties across billions of chips manufactured by dozens of licensees. (2) Neoverse/CSS commands 3-5x higher royalty rates than mobile cores — meaning your program management of server and AI compute IP programs has an outsized revenue-per-design impact. Neoverse/CSS programs are ARM's most complex and highest-value deliverables. (3) Candidates should argue: 'ARM's royalty model means my program delivery generates revenue across billions of chips over 5-10 years. Each Neoverse/CSS program I deliver generates 3-5x the royalty rate of mobile cores. My equity should reflect this royalty multiplier — I want higher ARM RSU density because my work compounds into billions of royalty events.' (4) Push for equity-dense packages because ARM's royalty revenue is the most compounding business model in semis — every IP program you deliver on time generates revenue for years across every licensee."

**Global Levers**

1. **Royalty Multiplier — Equity Density:** "My program management delivers ARM IP releases that ship in billions of chips generating recurring royalties. Every week I pull in on a program schedule accelerates royalty revenue across the entire licensee ecosystem. My equity allocation should reflect this delivery-to-royalty multiplier — ARM RSU density matching the compounding revenue my program orchestration enables."
2. **Neoverse/CSS — Server Revenue Expansion:** "Neoverse/CSS programs are ARM's most complex and highest-value IP deliverables. I coordinate across hardware, software, and verification teams globally to ensure these programs deliver on schedule. CSS compute sub-systems command premium royalties, and my program management directly determines ARM's server compute delivery cadence."
3. **99% Smartphone + Server + AI:** "ARM's program portfolio spans the broadest compute footprint in the industry. As a TPM, I manage dependencies and deliverables across mobile, server, automotive, and AI compute IP programs simultaneously. This cross-domain program complexity is unique to ARM — my orchestration skills span the world's most diverse semiconductor IP portfolio."
4. **Global Coordination — Multi-Site Delivery:** "ARM's engineering organization spans Cambridge, San Jose, Austin, and additional sites globally. As a TPM, I coordinate cross-site program delivery across time zones and cultures — a unique challenge in semiconductor IP development. My ability to orchestrate global engineering teams directly impacts ARM's IP delivery velocity and royalty revenue acceleration."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $162K base and $240K ARM RSUs over 4 years for this Technical Program Manager position with royalty-multiplier equity density. My program orchestration delivers IP releases that generate royalties across billions of chips — I want RSU density reflecting the compounding revenue model. I bring strong technical program management experience in semiconductor IP delivery with a track record of coordinating complex, multi-team programs across global engineering organizations. My Neoverse/CSS program leadership directly accelerates ARM's highest-value revenue stream. I have competing offers from NVIDIA at $235K TC / Intel at $225K TC." Accept at $152K+ base and $210K+ RSUs.
