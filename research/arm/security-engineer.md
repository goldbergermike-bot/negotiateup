**Negotiation DNA**

ARM is the world's most pervasive compute architecture, powering 99% of smartphones and expanding into servers via Neoverse, automotive, and AI accelerators. As a Security Engineer at ARM, you design and validate the security architecture — TrustZone, Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA), Realm Management Extensions, and platform security — that protects billions of ARM-based devices worldwide. ARM's royalty-based business model means every security feature you design ships across billions of chips manufactured by dozens of licensees, and security is increasingly a competitive differentiator that wins design wins. The Neoverse server CPU platform and CSS (Compute Sub-Systems) require enterprise-grade security including CCA and attestation frameworks — making security engineers who harden server compute platforms critical to ARM's data center market capture. Post-IPO ARM (NASDAQ: ARM) RSU packages benefit from the premium royalties that security-enriched IP commands.

**Level Mapping:** ARM Security Engineer = NVIDIA Security Engineer = Intel Security Engineer (Grade 7-8) = Google L4/L5 Security Engineer

**Royalty Multiplier — Neoverse/CSS Equity Density**

ARM's business model is unique in semiconductors: you design once, and ARM collects royalties on every chip manufactured — billions of chips per year across smartphones, servers, automotive, IoT, and AI accelerators. The Neoverse server platform and CSS (Compute Sub-Systems) amplify this: CSS delivers complete compute sub-systems that command higher royalty rates than individual IP cores. "As a Security Engineer, your security architecture and hardening work protects billions of ARM-based devices and is increasingly the reason licensees choose ARM IP over alternatives. TrustZone, CCA, and platform security features you design don't protect one product — they protect billions of chips across the entire ARM ecosystem. Key points: (1) ARM's royalty model means each engineer's work generates revenue across billions of chips — a multiplier effect no other semiconductor company has. As a security engineer, your security architecture isn't deployed once; it protects billions of chips and is a key design-win differentiator that drives licensee adoption. (2) Neoverse/CSS commands 3-5x higher royalty rates than mobile cores — meaning your security work on CCA, attestation, and server compute hardening has an outsized revenue-per-design impact. Enterprise security requirements in data centers make your work a critical enabler of Neoverse adoption. (3) Candidates should argue: 'ARM's royalty model means my security architecture work generates revenue across billions of chips over 5-10 years. Each Neoverse/CSS design I secure with CCA and platform security generates 3-5x the royalty rate of mobile cores. My equity should reflect this royalty multiplier — I want higher ARM RSU density because my work compounds into billions of royalty events.' (4) Push for equity-dense packages because ARM's royalty revenue is the most compounding business model in semis — every security feature you design protects and enables revenue for years across every licensee."

**Global Levers**

1. **Royalty Multiplier — Equity Density:** "My security architecture protects billions of ARM-based chips and is a critical design-win differentiator. Every TrustZone, CCA, or platform security feature I design doesn't protect one product — it secures billions of chips across dozens of licensees. My equity allocation should reflect this security-driven royalty multiplier — ARM RSU density matching the compounding revenue my security work enables and protects."
2. **Neoverse/CSS — Server Revenue Expansion:** "Data center security requirements are the highest in the industry. My work on CCA, attestation frameworks, and server platform security directly determines whether enterprise customers trust ARM-based servers. CSS compute sub-systems require enterprise-grade security hardening, and my security engineering is a critical enabler of ARM's server market capture."
3. **99% Smartphone + Server + AI:** "ARM's security architecture spans the broadest attack surface in computing — from mobile TrustZone to server CCA to automotive functional safety. As a security engineer, I design security features that must scale from IoT to data centers. This cross-domain security challenge is unique to ARM — my security architecture protects the world's most deployed compute platform."
4. **Security as Design-Win Differentiator:** "Security is increasingly the deciding factor in licensee IP selection. My security engineering — TrustZone, CCA, attestation, secure boot — directly drives ARM design wins over competing architectures. Every design win my security features enable generates a new royalty revenue stream across billions of chips. Security engineering at ARM is revenue-generating, not cost-center work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $185K base and $285K ARM RSUs over 4 years for this Security Engineer position with royalty-multiplier equity density. My security architecture protects and enables royalties across billions of chips — I want RSU density reflecting the compounding revenue model. I bring deep expertise in hardware security architecture, TEE design, and confidential computing directly applicable to ARM's TrustZone and CCA platforms. My Neoverse security hardening work is critical to ARM's data center market capture. I have competing offers from NVIDIA at $270K TC / Google at $280K TC." Accept at $175K+ base and $250K+ RSUs.
