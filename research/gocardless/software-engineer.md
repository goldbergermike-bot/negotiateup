**Negotiation DNA**

GoCardless is a private fintech valued at approximately $2.1B, backed by Bain Capital, Accel, and Google Ventures. The company powers bank-to-bank payments for over 85,000 businesses globally, positioning it at the center of the global shift from card-based to account-to-account payments. As a Software Engineer, you are joining a platform that processes billions in payment volume annually, with direct impact on reliability, throughput, and compliance across multiple regulatory jurisdictions.

The February 2026 $200M secondary sale signals strong investor confidence and provides a meaningful liquidity pathway for option holders — a critical consideration when evaluating your equity package. GoCardless's acquisition of Nuapay has expanded its open banking infrastructure capabilities, and the company's leadership in Variable Recurring Payments (VRP) is creating new product surface area that requires engineering capacity. Software Engineers at GoCardless build directly on the payment rails that connect banks, merchants, and consumers — making this a high-impact entry point into fintech infrastructure.

### Secondary — The VRP Leadership Premium

**Lever 1 — Secondary Liquidity Anchor:** "GoCardless completed a $200M secondary sale in February 2026, which demonstrates that option holders have real, near-term liquidity pathways. I'd like my option grant to reflect the fact that this isn't speculative equity — there's a proven mechanism for realization, and I'd like to see that confidence reflected in my initial grant size."

**Lever 2 — Nuapay Integration Complexity:** "The Nuapay acquisition has created an integration workload that directly impacts engineering teams. I'll be contributing to merging open banking infrastructure into the core platform, which is the kind of high-complexity, high-stakes work that warrants a premium. I'm asking for a 10-15% increase on the base offer to reflect this expanded scope."

**Lever 3 — VRP Product Velocity:** "GoCardless is the clear leader in Variable Recurring Payments, and VRP adoption is accelerating across UK and EU markets. Engineers building on VRP rails are doing category-defining work. I'd like my compensation to reflect the strategic importance of this product line — specifically through additional options that vest over the standard 4-year schedule."

**Lever 4 — 85K Business Scale Premium:** "Supporting a payment network that serves 85,000+ businesses means every line of code I write has outsized blast radius. The reliability and scalability expectations for engineers at GoCardless are closer to those at large public fintechs like Stripe or Adyen, and my compensation should reflect that level of responsibility even at the junior level."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a 12-15% uplift on the initial base offer and push for a 1.5x multiplier on the standard option grant. In London, aim for £70,000+ base with £25,000+ in annualized options value. In San Francisco, target $135,000+ base with $45,000+ in options. Use the $200M secondary sale as your anchor for why options carry real value. Your accept-at floor should be no lower than the midpoint of the posted range: £65,000 / $125,000 / A$115,000 base, with at minimum the standard option grant.
