**Negotiation DNA**

GoCardless operates a global bank-to-bank payment network serving 85,000+ businesses, and Senior Software Engineers are the backbone of this platform. At the senior level, you own end-to-end delivery of critical payment infrastructure — from direct debit processing to the emerging open banking and instant payment rails that represent the company's future. GoCardless is privately held at a ~$2.1B valuation, backed by Bain Capital, Accel, and Google Ventures, which means your equity package comes as options with a 4-year vesting schedule rather than RSUs.

The company's February 2026 $200M secondary sale is the single most important data point for your negotiation. It proves that GoCardless options are not just theoretical value — there is a demonstrated, recent liquidity event that option holders can point to. Combined with the Nuapay acquisition, which brought open banking infrastructure and payment initiation capabilities in-house, GoCardless is building a vertically integrated payment stack. Senior engineers working on VRP (Variable Recurring Payment) infrastructure are especially well-positioned, as VRP represents the next wave of recurring payment innovation beyond traditional direct debit. This is the kind of role where you are simultaneously building on proven revenue streams and pioneering new product categories.

### Secondary — The VRP Leadership Premium

**Lever 1 — Proven Liquidity Path:** "The $200M secondary sale GoCardless completed in February 2026 is a strong signal that my options will have real liquidity well before a potential IPO. I'd like to negotiate a larger initial option grant — specifically 1.5x the standard offer — because this isn't speculative private company equity anymore. There's a proven exit mechanism."

**Lever 2 — Nuapay Integration Ownership:** "The Nuapay acquisition means senior engineers are taking on integration work that spans two previously independent codebases and payment architectures. I'll be expected to lead the technical convergence of GoCardless's direct debit platform with Nuapay's open banking infrastructure. That's a scope expansion beyond a typical senior engineer role, and I'm requesting a base salary at the top of the band — £100,000+ in London or $190,000+ in SF — to reflect it."

**Lever 3 — VRP Technical Leadership:** "Variable Recurring Payments are GoCardless's strategic growth vector, and senior engineers on VRP teams are doing first-of-kind work in payment scheme design and bank API integration. I want my compensation to reflect the fact that VRP expertise is scarce and strategically critical. I'm asking for an additional options top-up specifically tied to VRP delivery milestones."

**Lever 4 — Scale and Reliability Premium:** "GoCardless processes payments for 85,000+ businesses, and a single outage can cascade across thousands of merchants and millions of end consumers. At the senior level, I'm on-call for systems that handle real money flows. The reliability expectations here rival public fintech companies like Stripe, and I'd like my total compensation — particularly the bonus component — to reflect that operational burden."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Push for top-quartile base (£95,000-£105,000 London / $185,000-$200,000 SF / A$160,000-A$175,000 Melbourne) and negotiate options at 1.5-2x the initial offer. Anchor on the $200M secondary sale to justify treating options closer to liquid equity. Target total comp of £150,000+ / $270,000+ / A$230,000+. Your accept-at floor should be £85,000 / $170,000 / A$145,000 base with at minimum the standard option grant. If the base is firm, push for a signing bonus of £10,000-£15,000 / $15,000-$25,000 as a bridge.
