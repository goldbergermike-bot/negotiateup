**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at GoCardless are the guardians of uptime for a global bank-to-bank payment network that serves 85,000+ businesses. In payments infrastructure, reliability is not a nice-to-have — it is the product. Every minute of downtime translates to failed payment collections, merchant revenue loss, and regulatory exposure. GoCardless is privately held at ~$2.1B, backed by Bain Capital, Accel, and Google Ventures, and the company's infrastructure team bears the weight of maintaining 99.99%+ availability across multiple payment schemes and regulatory jurisdictions.

The $200M secondary sale completed in February 2026 provides a concrete liquidity signal for option holders. For DevOps Engineers, this is especially relevant because the on-call burden and operational intensity of the role justify a meaningful equity component. The Nuapay acquisition has doubled the infrastructure footprint — GoCardless now operates both its legacy direct debit infrastructure and Nuapay's open banking platform, and DevOps Engineers are responsible for converging these environments. VRP (Variable Recurring Payment) infrastructure requires real-time payment processing capabilities that differ fundamentally from batch-oriented direct debit — this means DevOps Engineers working on VRP are building new infrastructure patterns, not just maintaining existing ones.

### Secondary — The VRP Leadership Premium

**Lever 1 — Secondary Sale On-Call Premium:** "The $200M secondary sale in February 2026 proves GoCardless options have real value, and I'd like my option grant to reflect the on-call burden that comes with managing payment infrastructure. I carry pager responsibility for systems that move real money — my options should be 1.4x the standard grant to compensate for this operational intensity."

**Lever 2 — Nuapay Infrastructure Convergence:** "The Nuapay acquisition created a dual-infrastructure reality — two cloud environments, two deployment pipelines, two monitoring stacks. As a DevOps Engineer, I'm responsible for converging these into a unified, reliable platform. This is infrastructure M&A work that goes well beyond typical DevOps scope, and I'm requesting a 10-15% base increase to reflect the expanded operational domain."

**Lever 3 — VRP Real-Time Infrastructure:** "Variable Recurring Payments require real-time payment processing infrastructure — a fundamentally different architecture from GoCardless's traditional batch-oriented direct debit systems. I'll be building and operating real-time payment rails with sub-second latency requirements. This is a step-change in infrastructure complexity, and my compensation should reflect the specialized skills required."

**Lever 4 — Payment Network Reliability at Scale:** "Operating infrastructure for a payment network serving 85,000+ businesses means every deployment, every configuration change, and every scaling decision has direct financial consequences. The blast radius of a misconfiguration in this environment is orders of magnitude larger than in a typical SaaS company. I'd like my total compensation — base plus options plus on-call bonus — to be competitive with SRE roles at Stripe and Adyen."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target upper-band base (£90,000-£100,000 London / $180,000-$195,000 SF / A$145,000-A$160,000 Melbourne) and negotiate 1.4x the standard option grant. Push for an explicit on-call stipend if one is not already included (£5,000-£8,000 / $8,000-$12,000 annually). Total comp target: £135,000+ / $250,000+ / A$200,000+. Accept-at floor: £80,000 / $160,000 / A$130,000 base with standard option grant and confirmed on-call compensation. Anchor on the $200M secondary sale and the Nuapay infrastructure convergence scope.
