**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at GoCardless build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers a bank-to-bank payment network serving 85,000+ businesses. The data engineering challenge at GoCardless is unique in its complexity — payment data flows in from multiple bank integrations, payment schemes, and regulatory jurisdictions, each with different formats, latencies, and compliance requirements. GoCardless is privately held at ~$2.1B, backed by Bain Capital, Accel, and Google Ventures, and the data platform is a strategic asset that supports product analytics, fraud detection, financial reporting, and regulatory compliance.

The $200M secondary sale completed in February 2026 provides a concrete liquidity path for option holders, making the equity component of your compensation package more tangible than at a typical pre-IPO company. The Nuapay acquisition has significantly expanded the data engineering scope — open banking payment data, payment initiation events, and account information service data all need to be integrated into GoCardless's existing data warehouse and real-time processing infrastructure. VRP (Variable Recurring Payment) data engineering is a particularly important area, as VRP generates real-time transaction events that require streaming data architectures rather than the batch processing pipelines that serve traditional direct debit data. Data Engineers who can build reliable pipelines across both paradigms are in high demand.

### Secondary — The VRP Leadership Premium

**Lever 1 — Secondary Sale Data Platform Value:** "GoCardless's $200M secondary sale in February 2026 was enabled in part by the data platform's ability to demonstrate payment volume growth, fraud reduction, and merchant health metrics to investors. Data infrastructure directly supports the company's valuation story. I'd like my option grant to reflect this — 1.3x the standard offer, recognizing that the data platform I build underpins the equity value we're discussing."

**Lever 2 — Nuapay Data Integration:** "The Nuapay acquisition created a data integration challenge that spans two fundamentally different payment data architectures. I'll be building pipelines that unify open banking event data with GoCardless's existing direct debit transaction records, reconciliation flows, and merchant analytics. This cross-platform data engineering work requires deep domain expertise in payment data modeling. I'm requesting a 10-15% base increase to reflect this specialized scope."

**Lever 3 — VRP Streaming Architecture:** "Variable Recurring Payments generate real-time transaction events that require streaming data infrastructure — a fundamentally different architecture from GoCardless's existing batch-oriented data pipelines. I'll be designing and building the real-time data backbone for VRP, including event streaming, real-time analytics, and live transaction monitoring. This is a new-build data engineering challenge, not incremental work, and my compensation should reflect it."

**Lever 4 — Payment Data Compliance at Scale:** "Building data infrastructure for 85,000+ businesses across multiple regulatory jurisdictions means every pipeline I design must account for data residency requirements, PII handling regulations, and financial reporting standards. Payment data engineering carries compliance burdens that general data engineering roles do not. My total compensation should be competitive with data engineering roles at Stripe and Wise, where the regulatory context is comparable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target upper-band base (£90,000-£100,000 London / $180,000-$195,000 SF / A$145,000-A$160,000 Melbourne) and negotiate 1.3x the standard option grant. Benchmark against Stripe and Wise data engineering compensation. Total comp target: £135,000+ / $250,000+ / A$200,000+. Accept-at floor: £80,000 / $160,000 / A$130,000 base with standard option grant. If VRP streaming infrastructure is explicitly in-scope, push for an additional 5-10% base premium. Anchor on the $200M secondary sale for option valuation.
