**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at GoCardless lead teams that build and maintain a global bank-to-bank payment network processing transactions for 85,000+ businesses. The role demands a rare combination of technical depth in payment systems and people leadership in a high-stakes, regulated environment. GoCardless is privately held at ~$2.1B, backed by Bain Capital, Accel, and Google Ventures, and the company's growth trajectory — evidenced by the $200M secondary sale in February 2026 — places increasing demands on engineering leadership to scale teams, processes, and architecture simultaneously.

The Nuapay acquisition introduced a significant organizational integration challenge that falls squarely on Engineering Managers. You will be responsible for merging teams, aligning engineering cultures, and integrating open banking capabilities into the core GoCardless platform. VRP (Variable Recurring Payment) teams in particular need strong engineering management, as these teams are building new product categories that require close coordination between engineering, product, and banking partner relations. The Engineering Manager role at GoCardless carries more operational complexity than comparable roles at many public fintechs because of the regulatory overlay — direct debit schemes, open banking regulations, and payment compliance requirements vary by jurisdiction and directly impact engineering decisions.

### Secondary — The VRP Leadership Premium

**Lever 1 — Secondary Sale Leadership Signal:** "The $200M secondary sale in February 2026 tells me GoCardless is at an inflection point where engineering leadership is critical to executing on the company's growth ambitions. As an Engineering Manager, I'm the force multiplier for my team's output. I'd like my options grant to reflect this leverage — specifically, I'm asking for options at 1.5x the standard EM grant, given the demonstrated liquidity path."

**Lever 2 — Nuapay Team Integration:** "The Nuapay acquisition means I'll be managing team integration across two engineering organizations with different cultures, toolchains, and architectures. This is M&A integration work that typically commands a premium in the market. I'm requesting a base salary at the top of the band — £125,000+ in London or $230,000+ in SF — plus a one-time integration bonus to reflect the elevated scope during the first 12-18 months."

**Lever 3 — VRP Team Building:** "Building out the Variable Recurring Payment engineering team is a greenfield leadership opportunity. I'll be hiring, onboarding, and retaining engineers for a product line that doesn't have established playbooks. The talent I recruit and the culture I set will determine whether GoCardless maintains its VRP leadership position. That founding-team-leader scope should be reflected in both base and equity."

**Lever 4 — 85K Business Reliability Mandate:** "Managing engineering teams responsible for payment processing across 85,000+ businesses means I carry operational risk that goes beyond typical engineering management. When a system fails, real businesses can't collect real payments. This on-call and incident management burden, combined with the regulatory compliance overhead, means my total compensation should be competitive with EMs at Stripe and Adyen — companies where the reliability stakes are comparable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Push for top-of-band base (£120,000-£130,000 London / $225,000-$240,000 SF / A$185,000-A$200,000 Melbourne) and 1.5x the standard option grant. Leverage the $200M secondary sale to frame options as near-liquid compensation. If the Nuapay integration is in-scope, request a £15,000-£20,000 / $20,000-$30,000 integration bonus payable at 12 months. Total comp target: £190,000+ / $330,000+ / A$270,000+. Accept-at floor: £105,000 / $200,000 / A$170,000 base with standard option grant and confirmed bonus eligibility.
