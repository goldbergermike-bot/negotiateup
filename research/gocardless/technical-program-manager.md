**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at GoCardless orchestrate the delivery of complex, cross-functional programs across a bank-to-bank payment network serving 85,000+ businesses. The role sits at the intersection of engineering, product, compliance, and banking partnerships — coordinating delivery across teams that operate under regulatory constraints, payment scheme deadlines, and bank integration timelines. GoCardless is privately held at ~$2.1B, backed by Bain Capital, Accel, and Google Ventures, and the TPM function is critical to executing on the company's ambitious multi-product expansion.

The February 2026 $200M secondary sale signals that GoCardless is operating at a scale and maturity where program management discipline is essential. The Nuapay acquisition alone created a multi-year integration program that requires TPM leadership across engineering, product, operations, and compliance workstreams. VRP (Variable Recurring Payment) rollout is another program that demands TPM expertise — the delivery involves bank-by-bank integration, regulatory approval workflows, merchant onboarding sequencing, and engineering delivery coordination. TPMs who can manage programs at this intersection of technology and regulation are rare in the market, and GoCardless competes for them against companies like Stripe, Wise, and traditional banks.

### Secondary — The VRP Leadership Premium

**Lever 1 — Secondary Sale Program Value:** "The $200M secondary sale in February 2026 demonstrates that GoCardless is executing on its growth strategy, and TPMs are directly responsible for that execution. Every major initiative that increased company value was delivered through program management. I'd like my option grant to reflect this delivery leverage — 1.4x the standard grant, because my work directly enables the value creation that supports equity appreciation."

**Lever 2 — Nuapay Integration Program Scope:** "The Nuapay acquisition created one of the largest integration programs in GoCardless's history, spanning engineering, product, compliance, and operations. As a TPM, I'll be driving this integration forward across multiple workstreams simultaneously. This is M&A integration program management — a specialty that commands a 15-20% premium over standard TPM roles. I'm requesting a base at the top of the band."

**Lever 3 — VRP Rollout Coordination:** "The Variable Recurring Payment rollout is a multi-stakeholder program involving bank partnerships, regulatory submissions, engineering delivery, and merchant onboarding. This isn't a simple feature launch — it's a market-creation program with external dependencies. TPMs who can manage this kind of program complexity at the intersection of technology and financial regulation are extremely scarce, and my compensation should reflect that scarcity."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Jurisdictional Program Delivery:** "GoCardless operates its payment network across 85,000+ businesses in multiple countries, each with different payment schemes, regulatory requirements, and bank integration timelines. As a TPM, I coordinate delivery across all of these jurisdictions simultaneously. The cross-border program management complexity here is comparable to what TPMs face at Stripe or large payment processors, and my total compensation should be competitive with those roles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target top-of-band base (£105,000-£115,000 London / $195,000-$210,000 SF / A$160,000-A$175,000 Melbourne) and push for 1.4x the standard option grant. If the Nuapay integration is explicitly in-scope, request a program milestone bonus of £10,000-£15,000 / $15,000-$25,000 tied to integration delivery. Total comp target: £155,000+ / $275,000+ / A$220,000+. Accept-at floor: £90,000 / $170,000 / A$145,000 base with standard option grant. Use the $200M secondary sale to frame options as a proven compensation instrument.
