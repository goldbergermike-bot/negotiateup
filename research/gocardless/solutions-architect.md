**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at GoCardless are the technical bridge between the platform and its 85,000+ merchant customers. The role combines deep payment systems knowledge with consultative selling — you design integration architectures, advise on payment scheme selection, and ensure enterprise merchants can maximize the value of GoCardless's bank-to-bank payment network. GoCardless is privately held at ~$2.1B, backed by Bain Capital, Accel, and Google Ventures, and Solutions Architects are directly responsible for revenue expansion within the existing customer base as well as technical pre-sales for new enterprise deals.

The $200M secondary sale completed in February 2026 adds credibility to the options component of your compensation, which is particularly relevant for Solutions Architects who often weigh GoCardless offers against higher-base roles at public companies. The Nuapay acquisition has expanded the solution set dramatically — Solutions Architects now need to advise merchants on open banking payment initiation, account information services, and VRP (Variable Recurring Payment) integration in addition to traditional direct debit. This expanded product surface area makes the role more complex and more valuable. VRP in particular creates new enterprise selling opportunities, as large merchants are eager to adopt recurring payment methods that offer lower fees and higher payment success rates than card-based alternatives.

### Secondary — The VRP Leadership Premium

**Lever 1 — Secondary Liquidity Revenue Link:** "The $200M secondary sale in February 2026 demonstrates that GoCardless is on a trajectory where my option value will be realized. As a Solutions Architect, I directly influence revenue through enterprise deal design and expansion. I'd like my option grant to reflect this revenue linkage — specifically, 1.5x the standard grant, because my work directly accelerates the business value that drives equity appreciation."

**Lever 2 — Nuapay Product Expertise Premium:** "The Nuapay acquisition means I now need to be expert in open banking payment initiation, account verification, and traditional direct debit — three distinct product domains. Solutions Architects who can consult across this expanded portfolio are rare. I'm requesting a 12-15% base increase to reflect the fact that my required expertise has effectively doubled."

**Lever 3 — VRP Enterprise Adoption:** "Variable Recurring Payments represent GoCardless's biggest enterprise selling opportunity in years. As a Solutions Architect, I'll be designing VRP integration architectures for enterprise merchants and educating them on a payment type many have never used. This is category-evangelism work, not just technical consulting, and it warrants both a higher base and a deal-linked bonus structure tied to VRP adoption."

**Lever 4 — 85K Merchant Network Leverage:** "Supporting and growing a payment network of 85,000+ businesses gives me direct influence over GoCardless's revenue trajectory. Every architecture I design and every integration I optimize contributes to payment volume and merchant retention. The revenue impact of a strong Solutions Architect at GoCardless is measurable and significant — my bonus structure should have uncapped upside tied to enterprise deal value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Push for top-of-band base (£105,000-£115,000 London / $195,000-$210,000 SF / A$160,000-A$175,000 Melbourne) and negotiate a variable compensation component tied to enterprise deal value or VRP adoption milestones. Target 1.5x the standard option grant, anchoring on the $200M secondary sale. Total comp target: £155,000+ / $280,000+ / A$220,000+. Accept-at floor: £90,000 / $170,000 / A$145,000 base with standard option grant and confirmed bonus structure. If the bonus is discretionary, push for a minimum guarantee of 10-15% of base in year one.
