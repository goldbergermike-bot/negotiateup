**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Airbase own the technical direction of critical subsystems — the real-time ERP sync pipelines with Oracle and SAP, the card transaction processing engine, and the AP automation workflows that deliver the company's 15% AI efficiency gain. At this level, you are not just writing code; you are making architectural decisions that define how Airbase's all-in-one spend management platform scales from mid-market to enterprise customers. Your influence extends directly to the Interoperability layer that enables Airbase to serve as the connective tissue between a customer's ERP, banking, and procurement stack.

Airbase's dual-hub model — with engineering centers in San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru) — means Senior Engineers often serve as technical anchors for cross-timezone feature development. You are expected to mentor engineers in both hubs, conduct design reviews, and ensure the codebase maintains the reliability standards that finance teams demand. With the company backed by Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital at a $600M+ valuation, and with Paylocity acquisition discussions in the market, the options package at this level represents significant upside. Senior Engineers are the backbone of Airbase's technical moat, and your compensation should reflect the deep domain expertise required to build fintech infrastructure that enterprise CFOs trust.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — Oracle/SAP Integration Depth:** "Airbase's competitive moat depends on deep, real-time bidirectional sync with Oracle and SAP ERP systems. As a Senior Engineer, I'll be owning the architecture of these integrations — not just maintaining them, but extending them to support enterprise-grade workflows. Engineers with this dual competency in fintech and ERP integration command a premium. I'm targeting $200,000 base, which is consistent with what Stripe pays L3 engineers working on similarly critical infrastructure."

**Lever 2 — 15% AI Efficiency Ownership:** "The 15% AI efficiency gain Airbase has achieved is a headline metric for customer acquisition and retention. At the Senior level, I'll be the engineer responsible for architecting the next generation of AI-driven automation — expanding that 15% to 20% or more. I'd like my options grant to reflect this leverage: $100,000 over four years positions me to be fully invested in the outcome."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability Platform Architecture:** "The Interoperability premium is Airbase's 2026 strategic lever. As a Senior Engineer, I'll be designing the abstraction layers that allow Airbase to integrate with any ERP, not just Oracle and SAP. This is the work that makes Airbase a platform rather than a point solution. I'm asking for a $25,000 signing bonus to reflect the architectural vision I bring — this is below what I'd receive at a public company like Bill.com for comparable scope."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Hub Technical Leadership (Bangalore/SF):** "With engineering distributed between San Francisco and Bangalore, Airbase needs Senior Engineers who can lead effectively across both hubs. I have direct experience managing cross-timezone development cycles and async code review workflows. This operational capability accelerates delivery timelines. I'd like a 15% increase to my options package — from $80,000 to $100,000 over four years — to reflect this cross-hub leadership multiplier."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $200,000 base (SF) or $205,000 (NY). Use Oracle/SAP integration expertise and the 15% AI efficiency metric to justify a $100,000 options/4yr grant. Push for a $25,000 signing bonus by citing Interoperability platform scarcity and comparable public-company offers. Accept-at floor: $180,000 base + $70,000 options/4yr in SF; $185,000 base + $70,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore roles, target ₹42,00,000 base with ₹25,00,000 options/4yr.
