**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Airbase define the technical trajectory of the entire platform. You are the architect behind the real-time ERP sync engine that connects Airbase to Oracle and SAP — the deep integration layer that transforms spend management from a standalone tool into an enterprise-grade financial operating system. At the Staff level, your decisions shape how Airbase's Interoperability platform evolves, how the 15% AI efficiency gain scales across product lines, and how the engineering organization in both San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru) aligns on technical standards.

This is a role with outsized leverage at a private company valued at $600M+. Airbase's all-in-one spend management platform — covering AP, corporate cards, and expense reimbursements — is architected by a relatively small engineering team, which means Staff Engineers have direct influence on product direction that would be diffused across dozens of engineers at a larger company. With Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital backing the company, and Paylocity acquisition discussions signaling potential exit paths, the options package at this level is a material wealth-building instrument. Your negotiation should reflect the fact that Staff Engineers at Airbase carry the technical weight of a VP-level role at a larger organization.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — Platform Architecture Ownership (Oracle/SAP):** "At the Staff level, I'll be owning the end-to-end architecture of Airbase's ERP integration platform — the real-time bidirectional sync with Oracle and SAP that is the company's primary competitive moat. This is not feature work; this is platform work that determines whether Airbase can move upmarket into enterprise accounts. I'm targeting $250,000 base, which reflects the platform-level scope and the scarcity of engineers who can architect at this intersection of fintech and ERP systems."

**Lever 2 — 15% AI Efficiency at Scale:** "Airbase's 15% AI efficiency gain is a powerful customer acquisition metric, but scaling it requires Staff-level architectural thinking — building the ML infrastructure, data pipelines, and feedback loops that allow AI automation to compound. I am the engineer who will take that 15% to 25%. My options ask of $180,000 over four years reflects the direct revenue impact of this work on Airbase's enterprise pipeline."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability as Strategic Moat:** "The 2026 lever — 'Deep ERP: The Interoperability Premium' — is fundamentally a Staff Engineering challenge. Building an abstraction layer that allows Airbase to integrate with any ERP, any banking partner, and any procurement system is the work that transforms the company from a spend management tool into a financial infrastructure platform. I'd like a $40,000 signing bonus plus accelerated vesting on the first-year cliff to reflect the strategic nature of this contribution."

**Lever 4 — Bangalore/SF Engineering Strategy:** "As a Staff Engineer spanning the San Francisco and Bangalore hubs, I'll be setting the technical standards, code review practices, and architectural patterns that both teams follow. This cross-hub leadership role is essential for Airbase's engineering velocity. I'm asking for a total compensation package of $480,000 — base plus options plus bonus — which is 15-20% below what Google and Meta pay L6/E6 engineers, reflecting Airbase's upside potential through options."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $245,000 base (SF) or $250,000 (NY). Justify a $180,000 options/4yr grant by quantifying the revenue impact of the Interoperability platform and the 15% AI efficiency scaling. Push for a $40,000 signing bonus with accelerated first-year vesting. Accept-at floor: $220,000 base + $130,000 options/4yr in SF; $225,000 base + $130,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore, target ₹65,00,000 base with ₹42,00,000 options/4yr. Total comp floor: $400,000 (SF/NY).
