**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Airbase sit at the intersection of finance domain expertise and platform strategy. You are the person who defines what Airbase builds next — whether that is deepening the Oracle and SAP real-time ERP sync, expanding the AI automation that has already delivered a 15% efficiency gain, or designing the Interoperability layer that allows Airbase's all-in-one spend management platform to serve as the central nervous system of enterprise finance operations. At a company where AP, corporate cards, and expense reimbursements converge in a single product, the PM owns the strategic sequencing of an unusually broad feature surface.

Airbase's product organization spans the San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru) hubs, which means PMs must be effective at driving alignment across distributed engineering teams while maintaining tight customer feedback loops with mid-market and enterprise finance leaders. With the company valued at $600M+ and backed by Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital, Product Managers have a direct line to company strategy. The Paylocity acquisition consideration adds urgency to the PM role — you are shaping the product that will define Airbase's value in the market, whether as an independent company or as part of a larger platform play.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — ERP Integration Product Strategy (Oracle/SAP):** "The real-time ERP sync with Oracle and SAP is not just a feature — it's the product strategy that unlocks enterprise revenue. As a Product Manager, I'll be defining the integration roadmap, prioritizing which ERP workflows to support next, and working with engineering to maintain the reliability that enterprise CFOs demand. I'm targeting $200,000 base because this role carries direct P&L influence on Airbase's enterprise pipeline."

**Lever 2 — 15% AI Efficiency Product Vision:** "Airbase's 15% AI efficiency gain is a product achievement, and the PM who defined the feature set that delivered it created measurable customer value. I plan to extend this AI advantage into new product surfaces — predictive spend analytics, automated anomaly detection, intelligent approval routing. I'd like an options package of $110,000 over four years to reflect the product vision I bring to this AI-driven roadmap."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability Platform Definition:** "The Interoperability premium is fundamentally a product decision — which integrations to build, which partners to prioritize, and how to position Airbase as the platform layer for enterprise finance. As a PM, I own that decision architecture. I'm asking for a $20,000 signing bonus and 20% annual bonus target to align my compensation with the strategic weight of these decisions."

**Lever 4 — Bangalore/SF Product Alignment:** "Managing product development across San Francisco and Bangalore requires a PM who can maintain product coherence while empowering distributed teams. I've led product orgs across multiple time zones and can accelerate Airbase's cross-hub velocity. This operational experience should be reflected in my total comp — I'm targeting $350,000 all-in, which is competitive with what Stripe and Bill.com pay PMs with this scope."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $200,000 base (SF) or $205,000 (NY). Leverage ERP integration product ownership and the 15% AI efficiency roadmap to justify $110,000 options/4yr. Push for a $20,000 signing bonus and 20% bonus target by citing the Interoperability platform's strategic importance. Accept-at floor: $175,000 base + $75,000 options/4yr in SF; $180,000 base + $75,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore, target ₹45,00,000 base with ₹25,00,000 options/4yr.
