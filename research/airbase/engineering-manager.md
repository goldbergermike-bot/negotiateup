**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Airbase are the operational backbone of the company's technical execution. You own the delivery of Airbase's all-in-one spend management platform — coordinating teams that build AP automation, corporate card infrastructure, and expense reimbursement workflows, all with real-time ERP sync to Oracle and SAP. In a company where the 15% AI efficiency gain is a headline product metric, the Engineering Manager is the person who ensures that gain is shipped reliably and expanded quarter over quarter.

Airbase's dual-hub engineering model — with teams in San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru) — makes the Engineering Manager role uniquely demanding. You are not just managing a single-site team; you are orchestrating cross-timezone delivery, managing hiring pipelines in both markets, and ensuring the Interoperability platform roadmap stays on track. With Airbase valued at $600M+ and backed by Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital, the EM role carries significant organizational leverage. Your options package should reflect the fact that you are scaling the team that builds the company's core competitive moat — the deep ERP integration layer that enterprise customers pay a premium for.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — Cross-Hub Team Leadership (Bangalore/SF):** "Managing engineering teams across San Francisco and Bangalore requires a specific operational skillset — async communication protocols, timezone-aware sprint planning, and cultural fluency. I've built and scaled distributed teams before, and this experience directly accelerates Airbase's delivery velocity. I'm targeting $235,000 base to reflect the cross-hub management complexity, which is more demanding than managing a co-located team at a company like Bill.com."

**Lever 2 — Oracle/SAP Integration Delivery:** "The real-time ERP sync with Oracle and SAP is Airbase's most technically complex product surface. As Engineering Manager, I'll own the delivery of this integration layer — managing the engineers, the timelines, and the customer escalations. The stakes are enterprise contracts worth six and seven figures. I'd like an options grant of $140,000 over four years to reflect the direct revenue exposure of this work."

**Lever 3 — 15% AI Efficiency Team Scaling:** "Airbase's 15% AI efficiency gain is a team achievement, and the Engineering Manager is the person who built that team. Scaling this advantage requires hiring the right ML and backend engineers, creating the right team structures, and maintaining velocity as the team grows. I'm asking for a $30,000 signing bonus to bridge the gap from my current comp — this is an investment in the person who will scale the AI efficiency story from a metric into a platform capability."

**Lever 4 — Interoperability Roadmap Ownership:** "The Interoperability premium is Airbase's 2026 strategic focus, and Engineering Managers will own the execution of that roadmap. I'll be the one translating the vision into sprint plans, hiring against technical gaps, and ensuring the platform ships on time. I'd like my bonus target set at 20% of base — $47,000 — to align my incentives with the delivery milestones that matter most for Airbase's enterprise expansion."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $235,000 base (SF) or $240,000 (NY). Leverage cross-hub management experience and Oracle/SAP delivery ownership to justify $140,000 options/4yr. Push for a $30,000 signing bonus and 20% bonus target. Accept-at floor: $205,000 base + $95,000 options/4yr in SF; $210,000 base + $95,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore, target ₹55,00,000 base with ₹32,00,000 options/4yr. Total comp floor: $340,000 (SF/NY).
