**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Airbase protect the financial data that flows through every layer of the all-in-one spend management platform. When enterprise customers entrust their AP workflows, corporate card transactions, and expense reimbursements to Airbase, they are trusting the Security Engineer who designed the threat model, hardened the APIs, and ensured SOC 2 compliance. The real-time ERP sync with Oracle and SAP adds a critical attack surface — bidirectional financial data exchange with enterprise systems demands the highest security standards.

Airbase's 15% AI efficiency gain introduces AI-specific security considerations — model integrity, data poisoning prevention, and adversarial input handling — that are emerging challenges in fintech security. The Interoperability platform, as it expands to support more integrations, exponentially increases the API surface that must be secured. Security Engineers at Airbase work across the San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru) hubs, maintaining consistent security practices and incident response capabilities across both locations. With the company valued at $600M+ and backed by Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital, a security breach would be existential. Your options package should reflect the asymmetric importance of this role — security is the foundation that every other function at Airbase depends on.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — ERP Integration Security (Oracle/SAP):** "The real-time bidirectional sync with Oracle and SAP creates a high-value attack surface — enterprise financial data crossing system boundaries in real time. As a Security Engineer, I'll be designing the authentication, encryption, and access control architecture for these integrations. Fintech security engineers with ERP integration experience are exceptionally scarce. I'm targeting $205,000 base, which reflects the premium that financial infrastructure companies pay for this specialization."

**Lever 2 — AI Security for 15% Efficiency Gain:** "Airbase's 15% AI efficiency gain depends on ML models that process sensitive financial data. Securing these models against adversarial attacks, ensuring data pipeline integrity, and maintaining compliance for AI-driven automation is an emerging security discipline. I bring this expertise. I'd like an options grant of $100,000 over four years to reflect the critical role AI security plays in maintaining customer trust."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability Platform Security Architecture:** "Every new integration in the Interoperability platform is a new potential attack vector. As the platform scales, the security architecture must scale with it — API security, partner authentication, data isolation, and audit logging across dozens of integration points. I'm asking for a $25,000 signing bonus because I bring the security architecture experience needed to scale the Interoperability platform without compromising Airbase's security posture."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Hub Security Operations (Bangalore/SF):** "Maintaining consistent security operations across the San Francisco and Bangalore hubs — including incident response, vulnerability management, and security code review — requires standardized processes and 24/7 coverage. I've operated security programs across distributed teams and can provide Airbase with around-the-clock security coverage. I'd like my total compensation to reflect this operational criticality — targeting $340,000 all-in."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $205,000 base (SF) or $210,000 (NY). Use ERP integration security expertise and the AI security challenge around the 15% efficiency gain to justify a $100,000 options/4yr grant. Push for a $25,000 signing bonus by referencing the expanding Interoperability platform attack surface. Accept-at floor: $175,000 base + $65,000 options/4yr in SF; $180,000 base + $65,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore, target ₹40,00,000 base with ₹22,00,000 options/4yr.
