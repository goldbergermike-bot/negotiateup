**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Airbase are the architects of the company's most differentiated capability: the AI-powered automation that has already achieved a 15% efficiency gain for customers across AP, corporate card, and expense reimbursement workflows. You are building the models that automate approval routing, detect fraudulent transactions, classify expenses in real time, and predict spend patterns — all on data flowing through Airbase's deep Oracle and SAP ERP integrations. In a market where Coupa and Bill.com offer basic automation, Airbase's AI-native approach is a competitive weapon, and you are the person building that weapon.

The Interoperability platform amplifies the ML/AI opportunity: as Airbase integrates with more financial systems, the training data grows richer, the model performance improves, and the AI efficiency gain compounds. ML/AI Engineers at Airbase work across the San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru) hubs, with the Bangalore team increasingly contributing to model development and feature engineering. With the company valued at $600M+ and backed by Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital, ML/AI Engineers are among the highest-leverage hires — your models directly drive the product metrics that determine Airbase's enterprise value and exit potential, including the Paylocity acquisition consideration.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — ERP-Native ML Models (Oracle/SAP):** "Airbase's deep integration with Oracle and SAP gives ML/AI Engineers access to enterprise financial data that no competitor can match. I'll be building models trained on real-time ERP transaction flows — spend categorization, anomaly detection, predictive reconciliation — that are only possible because of Airbase's Interoperability position. I'm targeting $220,000 base because ML engineers with fintech domain expertise and ERP data access are in extreme demand."

**Lever 2 — Scaling the 15% AI Efficiency Gain:** "The 15% AI efficiency gain is the headline metric, but the real opportunity is scaling it to 25% and beyond. This requires new model architectures, expanded feature engineering, and production ML infrastructure that can serve predictions at transaction speed. As the ML/AI Engineer who will drive this expansion, my options package should reflect this direct impact on Airbase's product value. I'm asking for $120,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability ML Platform:** "As the Interoperability platform grows, the ML opportunity scales exponentially — cross-ERP anomaly detection, multi-system spend prediction, universal transaction classification. Building the ML platform that can serve models across all integrated systems is a Staff-level ML engineering challenge. I'm asking for a $25,000 signing bonus to reflect the platform-building expertise I bring to this unique opportunity."

**Lever 4 — Bangalore/SF ML Team Collaboration:** "With ML engineering talent in both San Francisco and Bangalore, Airbase has the opportunity to build a world-class distributed ML team. I bring experience in collaborative ML development — shared experiment tracking, distributed model training, and async research reviews. This cross-hub ML capability accelerates Airbase's AI roadmap. I'd like my total comp to reflect this leverage — targeting $380,000 all-in, which is 20-25% below what Google and Meta pay L5/IC5 ML engineers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $220,000 base (SF) or $225,000 (NY). Use the 15% AI efficiency scaling opportunity and Oracle/SAP data advantage to justify a $120,000 options/4yr grant. Push for a $25,000 signing bonus by referencing the Interoperability ML platform opportunity. Accept-at floor: $185,000 base + $80,000 options/4yr in SF; $190,000 base + $80,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore, target ₹46,00,000 base with ₹28,00,000 options/4yr. Total comp floor: $300,000 (SF/NY).
