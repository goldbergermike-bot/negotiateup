**Negotiation DNA**

Airbase is building the definitive all-in-one spend management platform — unifying accounts payable, corporate cards, and expense reimbursements into a single real-time system. As a Software Engineer, you are the foundational builder of the product architecture that enables real-time ERP sync with Oracle and SAP, the deep integrations that separate Airbase from legacy competitors like Coupa and Bill.com. Your code directly powers the Interoperability layer that mid-market and enterprise finance teams rely on to eliminate manual reconciliation.

The company has demonstrated a 15% AI efficiency gain across its automation workflows, and engineers at this level are expected to extend that advantage by shipping features that reduce cycle times for AP approvals, card reconciliation, and expense routing. With engineering hubs in both San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru), Airbase offers a global development model where Software Engineers collaborate across time zones to maintain continuous delivery. Backed by Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital at a $600M+ valuation, Airbase's private equity structure means your options package carries meaningful upside if the company reaches an IPO or acquisition — the Paylocity acquisition consideration underscores this exit potential.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — Real-Time ERP Sync Complexity:** "I understand Airbase's core differentiation is real-time bidirectional sync with Oracle and SAP ERPs. Building reliable, low-latency integrations at this level of financial data sensitivity requires careful engineering. I'd like my base to reflect the specialized nature of this work — I'm targeting $155,000, which aligns with what Stripe and similar fintech platforms pay engineers working on payment infrastructure."

**Lever 2 — 15% AI Efficiency Multiplier:** "Airbase has publicly cited a 15% AI efficiency gain in its automation workflows. As a Software Engineer contributing to these AI-driven features, my work directly expands that efficiency margin for every customer. I'd like to discuss an additional options grant of $50,000 over four years to reflect my contribution to this compounding advantage."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability Platform Value:** "The Interoperability premium is what makes Airbase defensible against Bill.com and Coupa. Engineers who can build and maintain deep integrations across ERP ecosystems are scarce. I'm asking for a $15,000 signing bonus to bridge the gap between my current comp and Airbase's growth trajectory — this reflects the specialized integration skills I bring."

**Lever 4 — Bangalore/SF Hub Leverage:** "With Airbase operating dual engineering hubs in San Francisco and Bangalore, I bring the ability to collaborate effectively across distributed teams and time zones. This cross-hub fluency increases my impact on release velocity. I'd like my total compensation to reflect this operational multiplier — specifically a 10% bump to my options package."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Lead with base salary, targeting $155,000 (SF) or $160,000 (NY). Use the ERP integration complexity and 15% AI efficiency gain as justification for a $50,000 options grant. Push for a $15,000 signing bonus by referencing Interoperability platform scarcity. Accept-at floor: $140,000 base + $35,000 options/4yr in SF; $145,000 base + $35,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore roles, target ₹26,00,000 base with ₹14,00,000 options/4yr.
