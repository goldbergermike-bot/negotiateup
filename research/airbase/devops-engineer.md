**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Airbase are the reliability backbone of a platform that processes financial transactions in real time. When the all-in-one spend management platform — AP, corporate cards, expense reimbursements — experiences downtime, enterprise customers lose trust immediately. You are the engineer who ensures that the real-time ERP sync with Oracle and SAP never drops a transaction, that the CI/CD pipelines supporting the 15% AI efficiency gain deploy safely and frequently, and that the Interoperability platform scales gracefully as new integrations come online.

Airbase's infrastructure spans the San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru) engineering hubs, and DevOps Engineers are responsible for maintaining consistent deployment practices, monitoring, and incident response across both locations. At a private company valued at $600M+ with backing from Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital, the DevOps role carries outsized importance — financial infrastructure demands five-nines thinking even at a growth-stage company. Your options package should reflect the fact that platform reliability directly impacts Airbase's ability to win and retain enterprise customers in a competitive market against Coupa and Bill.com.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — ERP Sync Reliability (Oracle/SAP):** "The real-time bidirectional sync with Oracle and SAP is Airbase's most critical infrastructure surface. A single dropped transaction or sync failure can cascade into reconciliation issues for enterprise customers. As a DevOps Engineer, I'm the person who ensures this integration layer is resilient, observable, and recoverable. I'm targeting $190,000 base because financial infrastructure reliability is a premium skill, and Airbase's ERP sync demands it at the highest level."

**Lever 2 — 15% AI Efficiency Deployment Pipeline:** "The 15% AI efficiency gain depends on ML models being deployed safely and frequently through robust CI/CD pipelines. As a DevOps Engineer, I'll be building the infrastructure that allows data scientists and ML engineers to ship model updates without risking production stability. I'd like an options grant of $85,000 over four years to reflect the enabling role this infrastructure plays in Airbase's AI advantage."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability Platform Scalability:** "As the Interoperability platform grows — adding new ERP integrations, banking partners, and procurement systems — the infrastructure must scale without degradation. I bring experience in multi-tenant infrastructure design and API gateway management that directly supports Airbase's platform expansion. I'm asking for a $15,000 signing bonus to reflect this platform-scaling expertise."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Hub Infrastructure Consistency (Bangalore/SF):** "Running consistent infrastructure practices across San Francisco and Bangalore requires standardized tooling, shared runbooks, and unified monitoring. I've operated distributed infrastructure teams and can bring immediate improvements to cross-hub deployment velocity and incident response times. I'd like my total compensation to reflect this operational multiplier — targeting $310,000 all-in."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $190,000 base (SF) or $195,000 (NY). Use ERP sync reliability and the 15% AI deployment pipeline as justification for an $85,000 options/4yr grant. Push for a $15,000 signing bonus by referencing the Interoperability platform's infrastructure scaling requirements. Accept-at floor: $165,000 base + $55,000 options/4yr in SF; $170,000 base + $55,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore, target ₹36,00,000 base with ₹20,00,000 options/4yr.
