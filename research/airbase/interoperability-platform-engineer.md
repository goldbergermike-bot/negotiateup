**Negotiation DNA**

The Interoperability Platform Engineer is the role that defines Airbase's 2026 strategic lever: "Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium." This is not a standard software engineering role. You are building the connective tissue that transforms Airbase from an all-in-one spend management tool into an enterprise financial infrastructure platform. Your work enables real-time bidirectional sync with Oracle and SAP ERPs, powers the API layer that third-party systems connect to, and creates the abstraction framework that allows Airbase to integrate with any financial system — banking partners, procurement platforms, HR systems, general ledgers — without rebuilding the integration from scratch each time.

At Airbase, the Interoperability Platform Engineer sits at the intersection of three critical product domains: (1) the deep ERP integration layer that enterprise customers depend on for real-time financial data exchange, (2) the AI automation engine that has delivered a 15% efficiency gain by eliminating manual reconciliation and approval workflows, and (3) the extensibility framework that allows Airbase to serve as the central node in a customer's financial technology ecosystem. This convergence means you are not building a single feature — you are building the platform capability that unlocks Airbase's next phase of growth.

The role operates across Airbase's dual engineering hubs in San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru), and the Interoperability Platform Engineer is often the technical lead on cross-hub initiatives that require deep coordination between backend infrastructure teams, API design teams, and customer-facing integration specialists. With Airbase valued at $600M+ and backed by Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital, and with the Paylocity acquisition consideration adding strategic urgency, this role carries the kind of leverage that can define a career — and your compensation package should reflect it.

### Why This Role Commands a Premium

The Interoperability Platform Engineer role at Airbase commands a compensation premium for three structural reasons that you should understand before entering any negotiation:

**1. The Role Is the Product Strategy.** Airbase's 2026 lever is "Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium." This is not a marketing tagline — it is the product strategy that determines whether Airbase can move from mid-market to enterprise, whether the company can defend against Coupa's platform play, and whether the Paylocity acquisition consideration materializes at a favorable valuation. You are the engineer building the capability that defines the company's trajectory. In any negotiation, you should frame your compensation not as a cost but as an investment in the company's strategic execution.

**2. The Talent Market Is Extremely Thin.** Engineers who can architect enterprise-grade integration platforms — with deep knowledge of Oracle and SAP ERP schemas, financial data exchange protocols (EDI, ISO 20022, SWIFT), and modern API design — are exceptionally scarce. The intersection of fintech domain expertise, platform engineering skill, and ERP integration experience is a talent market of perhaps a few hundred qualified engineers globally. Your negotiation leverage is structural, not situational.

**3. The 15% AI Efficiency Gain Depends on Interoperability.** The AI automation that Airbase uses to deliver its headline 15% efficiency gain requires clean, real-time data from integrated systems. The Interoperability Platform Engineer is the person who ensures that data pipeline exists and scales. Without the platform you build, the AI models have no data, and the efficiency gain evaporates. This dependency gives you direct attribution to Airbase's most important product metric.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

This section provides eight negotiation levers — double the standard four — reflecting the strategic depth of this SIGNATURE ROLE.

**Lever 1 — Oracle/SAP Deep Integration Architecture:** "Airbase's competitive moat is the deep, real-time bidirectional sync with Oracle and SAP ERPs. As the Interoperability Platform Engineer, I am the architect of that moat. I'll be designing the schema mapping layer, the transaction reconciliation engine, and the conflict resolution logic that ensures enterprise financial data flows correctly between Airbase and these ERP systems. Engineers with this dual competency — modern API platform design plus legacy ERP integration — command $240,000+ base at companies like Workday and ServiceNow. I'm targeting $240,000 at Airbase, which reflects both the technical depth and the strategic importance of this work."

**Lever 2 — 15% AI Efficiency Data Foundation:** "The 15% AI efficiency gain that Airbase delivers to customers is built on top of the data that flows through the Interoperability platform. Without clean, real-time data from Oracle, SAP, and other integrated systems, the ML models that power automated approvals, spend categorization, and anomaly detection cannot function. As the engineer who builds and maintains that data foundation, I have direct attribution to Airbase's headline product metric. I'm asking for an options package of $160,000 over four years — which values my contribution to the AI efficiency story at a fraction of its revenue impact."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability as Platform Moat:** "The 2026 strategic lever — 'Deep ERP: The Interoperability Premium' — is fundamentally a platform engineering challenge. Building the abstraction layer that allows Airbase to integrate with any ERP, any banking system, and any procurement platform without custom engineering for each one is the work that transforms the company from a point solution into a financial infrastructure platform. This is the kind of platform work that creates 10x enterprise value, and I'm the engineer who will build it. I'd like a $40,000 signing bonus to reflect the immediate strategic impact I'll have from day one."

**Lever 4 — Bangalore/SF Platform Engineering Leadership:** "The Interoperability platform is built by distributed teams in San Francisco and Bangalore, and as the Platform Engineer leading this initiative, I need to be effective across both hubs. I bring experience in cross-timezone platform development — shared API contracts, distributed integration testing, and async architectural decision-making. This cross-hub leadership capability is essential for the Interoperability platform to ship on time and at quality. I'd like a 15% premium on my options package to reflect this operational multiplier."

**Lever 5 — Enterprise Financial Data Exchange Expertise:** "The Interoperability platform doesn't just move data — it moves financial data, which means compliance with EDI standards, ISO 20022 messaging, and SOX audit requirements. As an engineer with direct experience in financial data exchange protocols, I bring domain expertise that would take years to develop in-house. This expertise accelerates Airbase's enterprise readiness by at least two quarters. I'm asking for my base salary to reflect this domain premium — $240,000 is below what JPMorgan and Goldman pay infrastructure engineers with comparable financial protocol expertise."

**Lever 6 — Multi-ERP Abstraction Design:** "Today Airbase integrates with Oracle and SAP. Tomorrow, enterprise customers will demand NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics, Sage, and dozens of vertical ERPs. The Interoperability Platform Engineer designs the abstraction layer that makes adding each new ERP a configuration exercise rather than a six-month engineering project. This architectural vision — building the universal adapter — is what creates platform leverage. I'd like my total compensation to reflect this platform-creation scope: $450,000 all-in, which is 25-30% below what Google and Meta pay L6/IC6 platform engineers."

**Lever 7 — API Gateway and Partner Ecosystem Design:** "The Interoperability platform includes an API gateway that third-party developers and partners will use to build on top of Airbase. Designing this gateway — the authentication model, rate limiting, versioning strategy, and developer experience — is platform product work that creates ecosystem value. I've built API platforms that serve thousands of developers and can bring this ecosystem-building experience to Airbase immediately. I'd like my bonus target set at 20% of base, tied to API adoption metrics and partner integrations shipped."

**Lever 8 — Exit-Event Equity Leverage:** "With Airbase valued at $600M+ and the Paylocity acquisition consideration in play, the options package for the Interoperability Platform Engineer carries outsized exit-event leverage. The platform I build directly influences the company's enterprise value — every new integration increases the switching costs for existing customers and expands the addressable market. I'd like my options grant structured with 25% first-year vesting and quarterly vesting thereafter, reflecting the front-loaded impact of the Interoperability platform build on Airbase's valuation trajectory."

### Negotiation Timeline and Sequencing

For a SIGNATURE ROLE of this strategic importance, the negotiation should be sequenced deliberately:

**Round 1 — Base Salary Anchoring:** Open with base salary. Anchor at $240,000 (SF) or $245,000 (NY). Reference the talent market scarcity for platform engineers with Oracle/SAP ERP expertise. Do not discuss equity in Round 1 — let the base anchor set the tone.

**Round 2 — Options Package:** After base is established, introduce the options ask. Target $160,000 over four years. Use the 15% AI efficiency dependency and the Interoperability platform's direct impact on Airbase's enterprise value as justification. Request 25% first-year vesting to reflect front-loaded platform delivery impact.

**Round 3 — Signing Bonus and Bonus Target:** In the final round, push for a $40,000 signing bonus and 20% annual bonus target. Frame the signing bonus as a bridge from your current compensation, and the bonus target as an alignment mechanism for Interoperability platform milestones.

**Round 4 — Non-Cash Terms:** If cash compensation is at ceiling, negotiate for: (a) title — "Staff Interoperability Platform Engineer" or "Principal Platform Engineer" to set the promotion baseline; (b) accelerated vesting trigger on acquisition (double-trigger acceleration); (c) annual equity refreshers of $40,000-$60,000/year starting in year two; (d) conference and professional development budget of $10,000/year.

### Competitive Intelligence: Why Airbase Needs You More Than You Need Airbase

The Interoperability Platform Engineer role exists because Airbase faces a strategic inflection point. The all-in-one spend management platform — AP, corporate cards, expense reimbursements — is mature. The Oracle and SAP integrations work. The 15% AI efficiency gain is shipped. But the next phase of growth requires the Interoperability platform to scale from two ERP integrations to twenty, from a closed system to an open platform, from a mid-market tool to an enterprise infrastructure layer.

This transition is the hardest engineering challenge Airbase faces. It requires rethinking the data model, rebuilding the API layer, and creating abstractions that don't exist yet. Coupa has been building their integration platform for a decade. Bill.com is investing heavily in their partner ecosystem. SAP Concur has the advantage of being an SAP product. Airbase's window to establish its Interoperability position is narrow — 18 to 24 months — and the Interoperability Platform Engineer is the person who determines whether the company makes it through that window.

In your negotiation, you should make this competitive urgency clear without being adversarial. The framing is: "I understand the strategic importance of this role, and I'm excited about the opportunity. My compensation ask reflects the fact that I can accelerate Airbase's Interoperability timeline by months, and that the talent market for this skillset is extremely constrained. I'm not comparing to Google or Meta — I'm comparing to the cost of not filling this role for another quarter."

The Bangalore hub adds another dimension to this negotiation. If you are based in San Francisco or New York, you can highlight your ability to lead the Bangalore platform engineering team — setting architectural standards, conducting design reviews, and ensuring platform coherence across hubs. If you are based in Bangalore, you can highlight the cost efficiency of your location while still anchoring to the strategic value of the work. In either case, the cross-hub dynamic is a negotiation asset, not a liability.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** This is Airbase's highest-leverage technical hire. Anchor at $240,000 base (SF) or $245,000 (NY). Justify a $160,000 options/4yr grant by quantifying the Interoperability platform's impact on enterprise value — each new ERP integration increases ARR by an estimated $2-4M. Push for a $40,000 signing bonus, 20% annual bonus target, and 25% first-year option vesting. Accept-at floor: $200,000 base + $100,000 options/4yr in SF; $205,000 base + $100,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore, target ₹52,00,000 base with ₹35,00,000 options/4yr. Total comp floor: $350,000 (SF/NY). Non-cash fallbacks: Staff/Principal title, double-trigger acceleration, $50,000/year equity refreshers. Walk-away signal: if base is below $195,000 or total comp below $320,000, the offer does not reflect the strategic weight of this role.
