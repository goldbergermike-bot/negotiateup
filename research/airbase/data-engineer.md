**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Airbase build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers every aspect of the all-in-one spend management platform. You are the engineer who designs the real-time data pipelines that enable ERP sync with Oracle and SAP — ensuring that AP transactions, corporate card charges, and expense reimbursements flow seamlessly between Airbase and enterprise financial systems with zero data loss and sub-second latency. The 15% AI efficiency gain that Airbase delivers to customers depends entirely on the quality, freshness, and reliability of the data pipelines you build.

The Interoperability platform creates an expanding data engineering challenge: every new integration adds new data sources, new schemas, and new transformation requirements. Data Engineers at Airbase work across the San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru) engineering hubs, maintaining shared data infrastructure that serves both product analytics and customer-facing features. With the company valued at $600M+ and backed by Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital, the data engineering function is foundational — Airbase's ability to move upmarket into enterprise accounts depends on the reliability and scalability of its data layer. Your options package reflects the infrastructure-level importance of this role.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — Real-Time ERP Data Pipelines (Oracle/SAP):** "Building real-time bidirectional data pipelines between Airbase and Oracle/SAP ERPs is one of the most technically demanding data engineering challenges in fintech. These pipelines must handle complex financial schemas, maintain transactional consistency, and deliver sub-second sync across systems that were never designed to talk to each other. I'm targeting $195,000 base because this combination of real-time data engineering and ERP domain expertise is exceptionally rare."

**Lever 2 — Data Infrastructure for 15% AI Efficiency:** "The 15% AI efficiency gain is only possible because of the data infrastructure that feeds the ML models — clean, real-time feature pipelines, consistent training data, and reliable inference data flows. As a Data Engineer, I'm the person who builds and maintains this foundation. I'd like an options grant of $90,000 over four years to reflect the enabling role my data infrastructure plays in Airbase's headline AI metric."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability Data Layer Architecture:** "As the Interoperability platform scales to support dozens of integrations, the data engineering challenge grows exponentially — schema mapping, data normalization, conflict resolution, and cross-system data lineage. I bring experience building multi-source data platforms and can architect the data layer that makes Airbase's Interoperability vision technically feasible. I'm asking for a $18,000 signing bonus to reflect this architectural expertise."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Hub Data Infrastructure (Bangalore/SF):** "Maintaining consistent data infrastructure across the San Francisco and Bangalore hubs — shared data catalogs, unified schema registries, and cross-site data quality monitoring — requires deliberate engineering investment. I've built data platforms that serve distributed teams and can ensure Airbase's data infrastructure scales with the company. I'd like my total comp to reflect this systems-level impact — targeting $325,000 all-in."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $195,000 base (SF) or $200,000 (NY). Use the real-time ERP data pipeline complexity and the 15% AI efficiency data infrastructure as justification for a $90,000 options/4yr grant. Push for an $18,000 signing bonus by citing the Interoperability data layer scaling challenge. Accept-at floor: $165,000 base + $60,000 options/4yr in SF; $170,000 base + $60,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore, target ₹38,00,000 base with ₹20,00,000 options/4yr.
