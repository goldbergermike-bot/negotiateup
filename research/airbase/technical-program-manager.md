**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Airbase orchestrate the most complex cross-functional programs in the company — the deep Oracle and SAP ERP integration roadmap, the AI automation initiatives that have delivered a 15% efficiency gain, and the Interoperability platform build-out that is Airbase's 2026 strategic priority. You are the person who ensures that engineering, product, design, and customer success teams are aligned on timelines, dependencies, and deliverables across the all-in-one spend management platform (AP, corporate cards, expense reimbursements).

The TPM role at Airbase is especially high-leverage because the company operates dual engineering hubs in San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru). Cross-hub program management — coordinating sprints, managing dependency chains across time zones, and running effective cross-site retrospectives — is a core competency for this role. With Airbase valued at $600M+ and backed by Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital, TPMs at this stage have outsized influence on company execution. The Paylocity acquisition consideration adds urgency to program timelines, making the TPM role a critical enabler of Airbase's near-term strategic outcomes.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — ERP Integration Program Management (Oracle/SAP):** "The Oracle and SAP ERP integration program is Airbase's most complex cross-functional initiative — spanning backend engineering, API design, QA, customer success, and enterprise sales. As a TPM, I'll own the execution of this program end to end, managing the critical path and ensuring on-time delivery. I'm targeting $200,000 base because program management for enterprise ERP integrations is a specialized skill that commands a premium over general TPM roles."

**Lever 2 — 15% AI Efficiency Program Expansion:** "Scaling the 15% AI efficiency gain from its current state to broader product coverage requires rigorous program management — coordinating ML engineers, data scientists, product managers, and design teams across multiple workstreams. I've managed AI product programs before and can accelerate Airbase's automation roadmap. I'd like an options grant of $90,000 over four years to reflect the program-level leverage I bring to this initiative."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability Platform Coordination:** "The Interoperability platform is inherently a program management challenge — every new integration involves partner onboarding, API design, testing, and customer validation. As a TPM, I'll be the single point of accountability for this expanding matrix of workstreams. I'm asking for a $20,000 signing bonus to reflect the immediate organizational impact of bringing structured program management to this critical initiative."

**Lever 4 — Bangalore/SF Cross-Hub Program Execution:** "Managing programs across the San Francisco and Bangalore hubs requires specific techniques — timezone-aware scheduling, async communication protocols, and distributed dependency tracking. I've run cross-site programs at scale and can immediately improve Airbase's cross-hub delivery velocity. I'd like my bonus target set at 20% of base to align my incentives with on-time program delivery across both hubs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $200,000 base (SF) or $205,000 (NY). Use ERP integration program complexity and the 15% AI efficiency scaling as justification for a $90,000 options/4yr grant. Push for a $20,000 signing bonus and 20% bonus target by citing the Interoperability platform coordination scope. Accept-at floor: $175,000 base + $60,000 options/4yr in SF; $180,000 base + $60,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore, target ₹40,00,000 base with ₹22,00,000 options/4yr.
