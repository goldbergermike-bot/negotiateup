**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Airbase face one of the most complex UX challenges in fintech: making an all-in-one spend management platform — covering AP, corporate cards, and expense reimbursements — feel simple and intuitive for finance professionals who are accustomed to legacy tools. You are designing the interfaces for real-time ERP sync with Oracle and SAP, crafting the approval workflows powered by Airbase's 15% AI efficiency gain, and creating the visual language for the Interoperability layer that connects dozens of financial systems. The design surface is enormous, and the stakes are enterprise contracts.

Airbase's design team operates across the San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru) hubs, collaborating closely with product and engineering to ship features that mid-market and enterprise customers adopt immediately. At a private company valued at $600M+ with backing from Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital, Product Designers have an unusual degree of influence over the product experience. Unlike larger companies where design is one voice among many, at Airbase your work directly shapes the product's competitive positioning against Coupa, Bill.com, and Brex. Your options package represents meaningful upside tied to a product experience you are personally building.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — ERP Workflow Design (Oracle/SAP):** "Designing user experiences for real-time ERP sync with Oracle and SAP is a specialized skill — you need to understand both the technical constraints of bidirectional data flow and the mental models of finance professionals who interact with these systems daily. I'm targeting $180,000 base because this intersection of fintech UX and enterprise ERP design is rare, and Airbase's competitive advantage depends on getting it right."

**Lever 2 — AI-Driven UX for 15% Efficiency Gain:** "Airbase's 15% AI efficiency gain is only as valuable as the user experience that delivers it. If the AI automation is invisible to users, they won't trust it. If it's too prominent, it disrupts their workflow. Designing this balance is high-craft, high-stakes UX work. I'd like an options grant of $75,000 over four years to reflect the direct impact my design decisions have on customer adoption and retention."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability Experience Design:** "The Interoperability platform is Airbase's 2026 strategic lever, and the design of that platform — how integrations are configured, how data flows are visualized, how errors are surfaced — will determine whether enterprise customers see Airbase as a tool or a platform. I'm asking for a $15,000 signing bonus to reflect the platform-level design thinking I bring to this challenge."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Hub Design System (Bangalore/SF):** "Maintaining design consistency across the San Francisco and Bangalore hubs requires a robust design system and a designer who can drive adoption across distributed teams. I've built and scaled design systems that serve as the source of truth for engineering teams in multiple locations. This capability directly reduces development time and improves product quality. I'd like my total comp to reflect this systems-level impact — targeting $285,000 all-in."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $180,000 base (SF) or $185,000 (NY). Use ERP workflow design expertise and the 15% AI efficiency UX challenge to justify a $75,000 options/4yr grant. Push for a $15,000 signing bonus by referencing the Interoperability platform design scope. Accept-at floor: $155,000 base + $50,000 options/4yr in SF; $160,000 base + $50,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore, target ₹34,00,000 base with ₹18,00,000 options/4yr.
