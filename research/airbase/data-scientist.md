**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Airbase are the intelligence layer behind the company's all-in-one spend management platform. You are building the models that power the 15% AI efficiency gain — fraud detection on corporate card transactions, anomaly detection in AP workflows, predictive spend analytics, and intelligent categorization across expense reimbursements. Every model you build sits on top of real-time data flowing through Airbase's Oracle and SAP ERP integrations, giving you access to rich financial datasets that are rare in the data science field.

The Interoperability platform that Airbase is building creates an especially compelling data science opportunity: as Airbase integrates with more ERPs, banking partners, and procurement systems, the data surface expands dramatically. Data Scientists in this role will work across the San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru) hubs, collaborating with engineering teams to productionize models that directly impact customer retention and revenue. With Airbase valued at $600M+ and backed by Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital, the options package represents real upside for a Data Scientist whose models drive measurable product outcomes in the mid-market and enterprise segments.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — ERP Data Intelligence (Oracle/SAP):** "Airbase's real-time sync with Oracle and SAP generates a uniquely rich financial dataset — transaction flows, approval patterns, reconciliation timelines, and spend categorizations that span entire enterprise finance operations. As a Data Scientist, I'll be building models on this data surface that no competitor can replicate. I'm targeting $190,000 base because this combination of fintech domain data and ERP integration data is exceptional in the market."

**Lever 2 — 15% AI Efficiency Model Ownership:** "The 15% AI efficiency gain Airbase reports is the direct output of data science work — models that automate approvals, detect anomalies, and predict spend patterns. As the Data Scientist who will maintain and extend these models, I have direct attribution to a headline customer metric. I'd like an options grant of $95,000 over four years to reflect this measurable impact on Airbase's product value."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability Data Layer:** "As the Interoperability platform expands, the data science opportunity scales with it. Every new integration adds a new data source, every new customer adds training data, and every new ERP connection creates cross-system analytics opportunities. I'm asking for a $20,000 signing bonus to reflect the fact that I'm joining at the inflection point where the data advantage compounds most rapidly."

**Lever 4 — Bangalore/SF Model Deployment:** "With data science and engineering teams split between San Francisco and Bangalore, I bring experience in collaborative model development across distributed teams — shared feature stores, consistent model registries, and async experiment tracking. This cross-hub capability directly reduces time-to-production for new models. I'd like my bonus target set at 18% of base to align with the production impact of my modeling work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $190,000 base (SF) or $195,000 (NY). Use the 15% AI efficiency attribution and Oracle/SAP data surface to justify a $95,000 options/4yr grant. Push for a $20,000 signing bonus and 18% bonus target by citing the Interoperability data layer scaling opportunity. Accept-at floor: $165,000 base + $60,000 options/4yr in SF; $170,000 base + $60,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore, target ₹38,00,000 base with ₹20,00,000 options/4yr.
