**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Airbase are the bridge between the platform's deep technical capabilities and the enterprise customers who need to deploy them. You are the person in the room when a Fortune 500 CFO asks how Airbase's real-time ERP sync integrates with their existing Oracle or SAP environment — and you are the person who designs the implementation architecture that makes it work. The all-in-one spend management platform spans AP, corporate cards, and expense reimbursements, and the Solutions Architect must understand how each module maps to a customer's financial operations workflow.

Airbase's 15% AI efficiency gain is a selling point, but the Solutions Architect is the one who translates that metric into a customer-specific value proposition — demonstrating exactly where automation will reduce manual effort in their environment. With the Interoperability platform as Airbase's 2026 strategic focus, Solutions Architects are increasingly responsible for designing multi-system integration architectures that position Airbase as the connective layer in enterprise finance stacks. Operating across San Francisco and Bangalore (Bengaluru), and engaging with customers globally, this role carries direct revenue influence. With Airbase valued at $600M+ and backed by Menlo Ventures, Base10 Partners, and Bain Capital, your options package reflects the revenue impact of every enterprise deal you help close and implement.

### Deep ERP — The Interoperability Premium

**Lever 1 — Oracle/SAP Implementation Architecture:** "Every enterprise deal at Airbase requires a custom integration architecture for the customer's Oracle or SAP environment. I'm the person who designs that architecture, validates it with the customer's IT team, and ensures the real-time ERP sync works in production. This is direct revenue enablement. I'm targeting $210,000 base because Solutions Architects with ERP integration expertise command a premium — Coupa and SAP Concur pay comparably for this skill set."

**Lever 2 — 15% AI Efficiency Value Engineering:** "When I present to enterprise prospects, I translate Airbase's 15% AI efficiency gain into their specific ROI — mapping automation savings to their AP headcount, their card reconciliation cycle time, their expense report processing costs. This value engineering directly influences deal size and close rates. I'd like an options package of $100,000 over four years to reflect the revenue impact of this customer-facing technical work."

**Lever 3 — Interoperability Solution Design:** "As Airbase's Interoperability platform expands, the Solutions Architect role becomes the strategic linchpin — designing how Airbase fits into increasingly complex enterprise finance ecosystems. I bring experience architecting multi-vendor integration solutions and can immediately accelerate enterprise pipeline. I'm asking for a $30,000 signing bonus to reflect the deal-acceleration value I bring from day one."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Hub Customer Delivery (Bangalore/SF):** "With Solutions Architecture spanning both San Francisco and Bangalore, I can leverage the Bangalore engineering hub for implementation support while maintaining customer-facing relationships from SF or NY. This cross-hub delivery model reduces implementation timelines and improves customer satisfaction. I'd like my bonus target set at 25% of base — tied to implementation milestones and customer NPS — to align my incentives with Airbase's customer success metrics."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $210,000 base (SF) or $215,000 (NY). Use Oracle/SAP implementation expertise and the 15% AI efficiency value engineering as justification for a $100,000 options/4yr grant. Push for a $30,000 signing bonus and 25% bonus target tied to implementation milestones. Accept-at floor: $180,000 base + $70,000 options/4yr in SF; $185,000 base + $70,000 options/4yr in NY. For Bangalore, target ₹45,00,000 base with ₹25,00,000 options/4yr.
