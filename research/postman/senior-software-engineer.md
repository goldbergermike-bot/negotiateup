### Senior Software Engineer | Postman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5.6B Valuation) | API Development Platform | 30M+ Developer User Base | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $175K–$235K | $90K–$240K | — | $230K–$355K |
| Remote US | $160K–$220K | $80K–$220K | — | $210K–$330K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at Postman own major platform subsystems serving 30+ million developers. At Postman's scale, senior engineers have significant architectural influence across the API client, collaboration platform, or AI features. The company is growing from a developer tool into an enterprise API platform, creating new technical challenges around team workspaces, API governance, and enterprise security. Private equity requires aggressive negotiation with liquidity protections. [Source: Postman Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Postman Senior SWE = GitLab Senior SWE = Google L4 = Stripe Senior SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Platform Evolution:** "Postman is evolving from a developer tool to an enterprise API platform. I'm building the enterprise features (governance, security, team workspaces) that drive monetization."
2. **Developer-to-Enterprise Bridge:** "My work bridges individual developer adoption (30M+ users) with enterprise sales. Features I build convert free users into paying teams."
3. **Private Equity Premium:** "I need a 30-40% equity premium over liquid alternatives for the illiquidity risk."
4. **GitLab/Stripe Counter:** Both offer liquid or near-liquid equity at senior level. Push Postman equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $230K over 4 years with acceleration. I'm owning core platform architecture serving 30M+ developers and driving enterprise monetization." Counter at $190K-$220K equity is strong.
