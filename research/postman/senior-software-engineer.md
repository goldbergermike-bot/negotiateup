**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at Postman own major platform subsystems serving 30+ million developers. At Postman's scale, senior engineers have significant architectural influence across the API client, collaboration platform, or AI features. The company is growing from a developer tool into an enterprise API platform, creating new technical challenges around team workspaces, API governance, and enterprise security. Private equity requires aggressive negotiation with liquidity protections. [Source: Postman Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]
