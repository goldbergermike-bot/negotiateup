### Staff Software Engineer | Postman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5.6B Valuation) | API Development Platform | 30M+ Developer User Base | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $210K–$260K | $160K–$340K | — | $310K–$460K |
| Remote US | $195K–$245K | $140K–$310K | — | $290K–$430K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Engineers at Postman are the technical leaders defining the API platform's architecture. At Postman's company size, Staff Engineers function as domain-level CTOs — owning the technical strategy for the API client, API Network, enterprise platform, or AI features (Postbot). Staff Engineers at a $5.6B private company should negotiate for advisory-level equity terms including extended exercise windows, acceleration, and a grant sized for the upside potential of an IPO.

**Level Mapping:** Postman Staff SWE = GitLab Staff SWE = Google L5 = Stripe Staff SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Domain CTO Scope:** "At Postman's scale, I'm the technical leader for an entire platform domain. This is CTO-adjacent scope with corresponding impact on the 30M+ developer user base."
2. **IPO-Ready Architecture:** "My architectural decisions make Postman IPO-ready — scalability, security, and reliability at enterprise scale."
3. **Advisory-Level Equity Terms:** "At Staff level with significant illiquidity risk, I need advisory-level terms: 1-year exercise window, double-trigger acceleration, and a grant sized for IPO upside."
4. **Google/Stripe Staff Counter:** Both offer liquid equity at Staff level. The comp gap needs to be addressed with equity premium.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $440K total comp with equity at $320K over 4 years, advisory terms, and double-trigger acceleration. I'm defining the platform architecture for 30M+ developers." Counter at $270K-$300K equity with acceleration is competitive.
