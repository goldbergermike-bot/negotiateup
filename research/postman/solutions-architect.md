**Level Mapping:** Postman Senior SA = GitLab SA = Stripe SA = AWS Senior SA

**Global Levers**

1. **PLG-to-Enterprise Bridge:** "I help convert individual developer adoption into enterprise deployments. Each successful enterprise deployment is a multi-year ARR commitment."
2. **API Governance Architecture:** "I architect enterprise API governance frameworks — standardizing API practices across large organizations."
3. **Developer Community Expertise:** "My deep understanding of the 30M+ developer community helps me architect solutions that developers actually adopt."
4. **GitLab/Stripe SA Counter:** Both pay SAs competitively with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $180K over 4 years. My enterprise deployments convert free developer adoption into enterprise ARR." Counter at $150K-$170K equity is competitive.
