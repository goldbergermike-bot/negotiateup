### Solutions Architect | Postman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5.6B Valuation) | API Development Platform | 30M+ Developer User Base | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $155K–$215K | $65K–$190K | — | $190K–$310K |
| Remote US | $140K–$200K | $55K–$170K | — | $170K–$285K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Postman help enterprise customers deploy the API platform for team collaboration, API governance, and enterprise-wide API management. SAs bridge individual developer adoption (PLG) with enterprise deployment — helping organizations standardize API practices, configure team workspaces, and implement API governance policies.

**Level Mapping:** Postman Senior SA = GitLab SA = Stripe SA = AWS Senior SA

**Global Levers**

1. **PLG-to-Enterprise Bridge:** "I help convert individual developer adoption into enterprise deployments. Each successful enterprise deployment is a multi-year ARR commitment."
2. **API Governance Architecture:** "I architect enterprise API governance frameworks — standardizing API practices across large organizations."
3. **Developer Community Expertise:** "My deep understanding of the 30M+ developer community helps me architect solutions that developers actually adopt."
4. **GitLab/Stripe SA Counter:** Both pay SAs competitively with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $180K over 4 years. My enterprise deployments convert free developer adoption into enterprise ARR." Counter at $150K-$170K equity is competitive.
