**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Postman build the data infrastructure that processes usage data from 30+ million developers — API request patterns, testing workflows, collaboration metrics, and enterprise adoption signals. This data drives product decisions, enterprise sales intelligence, and Postbot AI training. The scale of Postman's usage data (billions of API requests tracked) creates significant data engineering challenges. [Source: Postman DE Comp 2025-2026]
