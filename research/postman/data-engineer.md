### Data Engineer | Postman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5.6B Valuation) | API Development Platform | 30M+ Developer User Base | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $160K–$220K | $70K–$210K | — | $200K–$325K |
| Remote US | $145K–$205K | $60K–$190K | — | $180K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Postman build the data infrastructure that processes usage data from 30+ million developers — API request patterns, testing workflows, collaboration metrics, and enterprise adoption signals. This data drives product decisions, enterprise sales intelligence, and Postbot AI training. The scale of Postman's usage data (billions of API requests tracked) creates significant data engineering challenges. [Source: Postman DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Postman Senior DE = GitLab DE = Google L4 DE = Stripe DE

**Global Levers**

1. **30M Developer Data Scale:** "I'm building data pipelines processing usage data from 30+ million developers. This scale of developer behavior data is rare."
2. **Enterprise Sales Intelligence:** "My data pipelines power enterprise sales intelligence — identifying product-led growth signals from individual developer adoption to team purchasing."
3. **AI Training Data:** If data feeds Postbot AI models, push for AI premium: "My data pipelines feed the AI models that power Postbot."
4. **Snowflake/Databricks DE Counter:** Both pay higher with liquid equity. Push Postman equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $200K over 4 years. I'm processing data from 30M+ developers to drive product and enterprise revenue decisions." Counter at $165K-$190K equity is competitive.
