### Engineering Manager | Postman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5.6B Valuation) | API Development Platform | 30M+ Developer User Base | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $200K–$255K | $130K–$300K | — | $290K–$430K |
| Remote US | $185K–$240K | $110K–$270K | — | $260K–$400K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Postman lead teams building the API platform for 30+ million developers. The company is in a growth phase, expanding from individual developer tool to enterprise platform. EMs must manage this transition — building enterprise features while maintaining the developer experience that drove organic adoption. Private equity requires aggressive negotiation. No standard cash bonus means equity is the primary variable lever for EM compensation. [Source: Postman EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Postman EM = GitLab EM = Google L5 Manager = Stripe EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Transition Leadership:** "I'm leading teams through Postman's most important transition — from individual developer tool to enterprise API platform. This requires building enterprise features without degrading the developer experience."
2. **IC Parity:** Staff ICs at Postman can earn $300K+ in equity. EMs must match or exceed.
3. **No Bonus = Higher Equity:** "Since Postman doesn't offer a cash bonus, the equity grant must fully compensate. My total comp shouldn't be lower than competitors who pay base + bonus + equity."
4. **GitLab/Stripe EM Counter:** Both offer competitive EM comp with more liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $285K over 4 years with acceleration. I'm leading the developer-to-enterprise transition, and I need comp that exceeds my Staff ICs." Counter at $240K-$270K equity with acceleration is competitive.
