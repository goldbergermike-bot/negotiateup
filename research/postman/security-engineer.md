### Security Engineer | Postman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5.6B Valuation) | API Development Platform | 30M+ Developer User Base | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $165K–$225K | $75K–$215K | — | $210K–$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Postman protect a platform that handles API credentials, authentication tokens, and sensitive API requests for 30+ million developers. The security surface is enormous — developers store API keys, OAuth tokens, and environment secrets in Postman. A security breach could compromise the API credentials of millions of developers and their organizations. Enterprise customers require SOC2, HIPAA, and data residency compliance.

**Level Mapping:** Postman Senior Security Eng = GitLab Security Eng = Stripe Security Eng = Google L4 Security

**Global Levers**

1. **API Credential Protection:** "Postman stores API keys, OAuth tokens, and authentication credentials for 30M+ developers. A security breach would compromise the API infrastructure of millions of organizations."
2. **Enterprise Security Requirements:** "Enterprise customers require SOC2, HIPAA, and data residency compliance. My security work directly enables enterprise revenue."
3. **AI Security Challenges:** If securing Postbot AI, push for AI security premium: "AI features that generate API requests introduce new security vectors — injection attacks through generated code, data leakage through AI suggestions."
4. **CrowdStrike/Snyk Counter:** Security companies offer premium comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $205K over 4 years. I'm protecting API credentials for 30M+ developers, and I have offers from security companies with liquid equity." Counter at $170K-$195K equity is competitive.
