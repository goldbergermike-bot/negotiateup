### API Platform Engineer | Postman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5.6B Valuation) | API Development Platform | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | 30M+ Developer User Base

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $165K–$230K | $80K–$220K | — | $210K–$340K |
| Remote US | $150K–$215K | $70K–$200K | — | $195K–$315K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Postman's signature engineering role. API Platform Engineers build the core Postman platform — the API development environment used by 30+ million developers worldwide. Postman is private ($5.6B valuation) and headquartered in San Francisco. The platform spans API design, testing, documentation, monitoring, and collaboration. Postman has evolved from a simple API testing tool into a comprehensive API platform — making this role central to the company's expansion strategy. Private equity means liquidity risk, but Postman's massive developer adoption (30M+ users) provides strong IPO potential. [Source: Postman API Platform Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Postman API Platform Eng (Senior) = GitLab Senior SWE = Google L4 = Stripe Senior SWE

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The API Platform Engineer works across Postman's core product:
- **API Client:** The desktop and web-based API development environment
- **API Network:** Public API documentation and discovery platform
- **Collections & Workspaces:** Collaborative API development workflows
- **Postman Flows:** Visual API workflow builder
- **Postbot (AI):** AI-powered API development assistant

**Global Levers**

1. **30M+ Developer Reach:** "Postman is used by 30+ million developers. My platform engineering work reaches one of the largest developer user bases in the world. The impact per-engineer is exceptional."
2. **Private Equity Upside:** "Postman at $5.6B valuation with 30M+ users has strong IPO potential. I need a larger equity grant to compensate for illiquidity while capturing this upside."
3. **API Economy Platform:** "APIs are the backbone of modern software. Postman is the platform that developers use to build, test, and document them. This is infrastructure-level market position."
4. **Stripe/Twilio Counter:** Both compete for API-savvy engineers: "Stripe and Twilio offer liquid equity for API platform engineers. Postman's private equity needs to be meaningfully larger."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $330K total comp with equity at $210K over 4 years and acceleration on change of control. I'm building the platform used by 30M+ developers, and I have offers from Stripe and Twilio with liquid equity." Counter at $175K-$200K equity with acceleration is competitive.
