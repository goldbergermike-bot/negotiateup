**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at Postman own the product roadmap for an API platform used by 30+ million developers. The PM challenge is managing the transition from a popular developer tool (product-led growth) to an enterprise API governance and collaboration platform (enterprise sales). Each PM owns a significant product domain: API Client, API Network, Collections/Workspaces, Postman Flows, or Postbot AI. Product decisions directly impact both developer adoption and enterprise monetization. [Source: Postman PM Comp 2025-2026]
