### Product Manager | Postman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5.6B Valuation) | API Development Platform | 30M+ Developer User Base | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $165K–$225K | $80K–$220K | — | $210K–$340K |
| Remote US | $150K–$210K | $70K–$200K | — | $190K–$315K |

**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at Postman own the product roadmap for an API platform used by 30+ million developers. The PM challenge is managing the transition from a popular developer tool (product-led growth) to an enterprise API governance and collaboration platform (enterprise sales). Each PM owns a significant product domain: API Client, API Network, Collections/Workspaces, Postman Flows, or Postbot AI. Product decisions directly impact both developer adoption and enterprise monetization. [Source: Postman PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Postman PM = GitLab PM = Google L5 PM = Stripe PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Product-Led Growth to Enterprise:** "I'm managing the most important product transition at Postman — converting 30M+ free developer users into enterprise purchasing. This PLG-to-enterprise playbook directly drives revenue."
2. **Developer Community Ownership:** "My product decisions affect the world's largest API developer community. Developer sentiment drives adoption."
3. **Postbot AI Strategy:** If owning Postbot, push for AI premium: "I'm defining the AI strategy for a platform used by 30M+ developers."
4. **Stripe/GitLab PM Counter:** Both offer competitive PM comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $210K over 4 years. I'm managing the PLG-to-enterprise transition for 30M+ developers, and I have PM offers from companies with liquid equity." Counter at $175K-$200K equity is competitive.
