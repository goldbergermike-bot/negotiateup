**Level Mapping:** Postman Senior TPM = GitLab Senior TPM = Google L5 TPM = Stripe Senior TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Growth-Stage Program Complexity:** "Managing programs at a growth-stage company serving 30M+ developers requires balancing speed with enterprise quality. This is harder than program management at mature companies."
2. **Enterprise Platform Programs:** If managing enterprise platform launches, push for premium: "My programs drive the PLG-to-enterprise transition."
3. **AI Feature Launches:** If managing Postbot AI programs, frame as high-priority: "AI programs are the company's highest-priority competitive initiative."
4. **Google/Stripe TPM Counter:** Both offer competitive TPM comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $190K over 4 years. I'm managing programs for a platform serving 30M+ developers during critical enterprise growth." Counter at $155K-$180K equity is competitive.
