### DevOps Engineer | Postman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5.6B Valuation) | API Development Platform | 30M+ Developer User Base | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $155K–$215K | $65K–$200K | — | $190K–$315K |
| Remote US | $140K–$200K | $55K–$180K | — | $170K–$290K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Postman manage the infrastructure that serves 30+ million developers worldwide. The platform must handle billions of API requests, real-time collaboration, and enterprise-grade reliability. Infrastructure reliability directly impacts developer trust — a slow or unreliable Postman degrades the productivity of millions of developers. There's a meta-quality: you're managing infrastructure for a platform that other developers use to test and manage their own infrastructure. [Source: Postman DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Postman Senior DevOps = GitLab DevOps = Google L4 SRE = Datadog DevOps

**Global Levers**

1. **30M User Scale Infrastructure:** "I'm managing infrastructure serving 30M+ developers processing billions of API requests. This scale requires enterprise-grade reliability."
2. **Developer Productivity Impact:** "A 100ms latency increase in Postman degrades the productivity of millions of developers. My infrastructure work has outsized impact."
3. **Meta-Infrastructure Frame:** "I'm managing infrastructure for a platform that developers use to manage their own infrastructure. The irony is real, and so is the standard."
4. **Datadog/Stripe Counter:** Both offer competitive infrastructure comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $190K over 4 years with acceleration. I'm managing infrastructure serving 30M+ developers, and I have offers from companies with liquid equity." Counter at $155K-$180K equity is competitive.
