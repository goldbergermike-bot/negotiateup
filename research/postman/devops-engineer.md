**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Postman manage the infrastructure that serves 30+ million developers worldwide. The platform must handle billions of API requests, real-time collaboration, and enterprise-grade reliability. Infrastructure reliability directly impacts developer trust — a slow or unreliable Postman degrades the productivity of millions of developers. There's a meta-quality: you're managing infrastructure for a platform that other developers use to test and manage their own infrastructure. [Source: Postman DevOps Comp 2025-2026]
