### Software Engineer | Postman Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($5.6B Valuation) | API Development Platform | 30M+ Developer User Base | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco HQ | $150K–$210K | $60K–$200K | — | $185K–$310K |
| Remote US | $135K–$195K | $50K–$180K | — | $165K–$285K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Postman is a private API development platform ($5.6B valuation) headquartered in San Francisco, used by 30+ million developers. SWEs build the API client, API Network, collaboration features, and AI capabilities (Postbot). Postman's compensation is base + equity (no standard cash bonus), making equity the primary variable lever. Private equity means liquidity depends on IPO or acquisition. The 30M+ user base provides strong IPO potential, but timing is uncertain. Push for a larger equity grant with acceleration and exercise protections. [Source: Postman SWE Comp Data 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Postman SWE = GitLab SWE = Google L3 = Stripe SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **30M User Platform Impact:** "My code ships to 30+ million developers. The impact per-engineer at Postman is among the highest in developer tools."
2. **IPO Potential:** "Postman at $5.6B valuation with 30M+ users is a strong IPO candidate. I need a larger equity grant to capture this upside while accepting illiquidity risk."
3. **No Bonus Compensation:** "Postman doesn't offer a standard cash bonus. The equity grant needs to compensate for this — my total comp shouldn't be lower just because the bonus component is zero."
4. **Stripe/GitLab Counter:** Both compete for developer-tools talent. Frame: "Stripe offers liquid equity and GitLab offers public RSUs. Postman's private equity needs to be 30-40% larger."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $190K over 4 years with double-trigger acceleration. I'm building a platform for 30M+ developers, and I have offers from companies with liquid equity." Counter at $155K-$175K equity is competitive.
