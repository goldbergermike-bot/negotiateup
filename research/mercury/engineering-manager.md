**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering managers at Mercury own team outcomes in a remote-first environment where team culture and engineering velocity depend entirely on leadership quality. Mercury's lean structure means each EM manages engineers who collectively own large product surfaces — you're not managing a feature team, you're managing a product team responsible for core banking features used by 200K+ businesses daily. The remote-first model adds complexity: building team cohesion, maintaining engineering standards, and running effective incident response across time zones requires deliberate management craft.

Mercury's hiring bar for EMs is high because the company prizes engineering culture — the "Mercury way" of shipping high-quality products with small teams. External EM hires need to preserve this culture while scaling it. If you've built remote-first engineering teams that ship high-quality products, you're exactly the profile Mercury seeks. The company's expansion into credit products, AI features, and international markets has created management gaps that can't be filled by internal promotion alone.

### AI Banking Team Leadership Lever

Mercury's AI banking strategy requires EMs who can manage teams that blend traditional backend engineers with ML/AI specialists. This cross-functional team management — ensuring that ML engineers and product engineers collaborate effectively, share infrastructure, and ship together — is a specific leadership skill that most EMs haven't developed. If you have experience managing ML teams alongside product engineering teams, you carry a premium.

The AI banking team is also the highest-visibility team at Mercury right now. Shipping AI features well builds Mercury's brand and valuation narrative; shipping them poorly erodes trust. EMs on this team have direct influence on Mercury's market positioning.

**Global Levers**

1. **Remote-First Leadership Premium:** "I've built and managed remote-first engineering teams that ship high-quality products. This remote leadership expertise — building culture, maintaining standards, running incident response across time zones — is essential for Mercury's model."
2. **Lean Team Ownership:** "My team collectively owns product surfaces used by 200K+ businesses daily. The EM role at Mercury carries more direct product accountability than at larger companies — and my comp should reflect that."
3. **Cross-Functional AI Team Management:** "I manage teams that blend backend engineers with ML/AI specialists. This cross-functional leadership — ensuring product and ML engineers ship together effectively — is a specific skill Mercury needs for its AI strategy."
4. **Culture Preservation Premium:** "Mercury's engineering culture is a competitive advantage. As an external EM hire, I need to both preserve and scale that culture. This is harder than building culture from scratch — and it's essential for Mercury's continued success."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $400K over 4 years with a $35K signing bonus and a guaranteed first-year bonus floor of 15%. I'm building and managing the teams that execute Mercury's AI banking strategy — the comp should reflect the strategic importance of these teams." Mercury will counter at $320K-$370K equity — accept at $350K+ with the signing bonus and bonus guarantee.
