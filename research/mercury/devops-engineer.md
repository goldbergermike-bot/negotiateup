**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps engineers at Mercury maintain the infrastructure for a banking platform that holds billions of dollars in customer deposits. Downtime isn't an inconvenience — it's a financial emergency for 200K+ businesses that depend on Mercury for payroll, vendor payments, and operating capital. Mercury's SLA requirements are banking-grade: 99.99%+ uptime, sub-200ms API latency, and zero data loss. Meeting these requirements in a cloud-native, remote-first environment requires exceptional DevOps expertise.

Mercury's infrastructure must simultaneously support banking operations (real-time transactions, ledger consistency), AI workloads (model training, inference serving), and compliance requirements (audit logs, data residency, SOC 2). DevOps engineers who can manage this multi-dimensional infrastructure — banking reliability, AI scalability, and compliance auditability — are the rarest hires Mercury makes.

### AI Banking Infrastructure Lever

Mercury's AI features require infrastructure that traditional banking platforms don't: GPU compute for model training, model serving infrastructure for real-time inference, and feature stores that bridge batch and streaming data. DevOps engineers who can manage both banking infrastructure (reliable, compliant, auditable) and AI infrastructure (GPU orchestration, model deployment, inference scaling) are unicorns in the fintech market.

If you have experience with both cloud banking infrastructure and ML/AI ops, you're solving Mercury's most critical hiring challenge. Frame this dual expertise as a premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **Banking-Grade Reliability:** "I maintain infrastructure that holds billions in customer deposits. Downtime means businesses can't make payroll. My reliability engineering directly protects Mercury's most critical asset: customer trust."
2. **Multi-Dimensional Infrastructure:** "I manage banking operations, AI workloads, and compliance requirements simultaneously. This trifecta of infrastructure demands is unique to AI-first banking platforms — and rare among DevOps engineers."
3. **AI + Banking Infrastructure:** "I bring experience with both cloud banking infrastructure and MLOps. This combination — reliability engineering plus GPU orchestration and model serving — is exactly what Mercury needs for its AI strategy."
4. **Remote-First Infrastructure Management:** "I build and maintain infrastructure in a remote-first environment where incident response, on-call, and infrastructure changes happen across time zones. This distributed reliability expertise is essential."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $220K over 4 years with a $18K signing bonus. I'm maintaining the infrastructure that holds billions in customer deposits while also building the AI infrastructure for Mercury's product differentiation. This dual responsibility justifies above-market comp." Mercury will counter at $175K-$205K equity — accept at $195K+ with the signing bonus.
