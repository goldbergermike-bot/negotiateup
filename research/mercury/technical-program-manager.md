**Negotiation DNA**

Technical program managers at Mercury coordinate the most complex cross-functional initiatives in startup banking: banking partner integrations (Mercury works through partner banks with their own technical requirements and timelines), regulatory compliance programs (OCC, FDIC, state banking requirements), and product launches that affect 200K+ businesses. TPMs at Mercury manage a unique combination of internal engineering velocity and external partner dependencies that can't be accelerated by throwing more engineers at the problem.

Mercury's 2026 priorities — credit product expansion, AI feature rollout, and international preparation — all require TPM coordination across engineering, compliance, legal, banking partners, and product. The remote-first environment adds coordination complexity: keeping distributed teams aligned on complex, multi-stakeholder programs requires exceptional communication and project management discipline.

### AI Banking Program Coordination Lever

Mercury's AI feature rollout is a cross-functional program that spans ML engineering, product, design, compliance, and banking partners. TPMs coordinating this rollout must understand both the technical dependencies (model training, feature pipelines, inference infrastructure) and the regulatory dependencies (AI in banking requires compliance review, model validation, and ongoing monitoring). This dual technical-regulatory program management is rare.

If you have experience managing AI/ML product launches in regulated industries, you're exactly the TPM profile Mercury needs. The ability to translate between ML engineers and compliance teams — ensuring AI features ship on time while meeting regulatory requirements — is a specific skill that commands a premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **Banking Partner Dependency Management:** "I manage programs with banking partner dependencies that Mercury can't control. This external-facing program management is fundamentally more complex than internal-only TPM roles."
2. **AI-Regulatory Bridge:** "I coordinate AI feature launches across ML engineering and compliance. Translating between technical and regulatory teams — ensuring AI features meet banking regulations — is a rare TPM skill."
3. **Remote-First Program Management:** "I manage complex, multi-stakeholder programs in a remote-first environment. Keeping distributed teams aligned on interdependent workstreams requires communication discipline that most TPMs haven't developed."
4. **Compliance Program Expertise:** "I've managed regulatory programs with hard external deadlines. This compliance TPM expertise ensures Mercury meets banking regulatory milestones without engineering velocity loss."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $225K over 4 years with a $18K signing bonus. I coordinate the programs that enable Mercury's highest-priority initiatives — AI feature launches and credit product expansion. My comp should reflect the strategic programs I drive." Mercury will counter at $175K-$210K equity — accept at $195K+ with the signing bonus.
