**Negotiation DNA**

Mercury is the banking platform that startups actually love — powering financial operations for over 200,000 startups and SMBs with a product experience that makes Chase and SVB feel archaic. The company reached a $3.5B+ valuation and has been profitable or near-profitable, which is rare for a fintech at this stage. Mercury's 2026 strategy centers on AI-powered financial automation: AI-generated cash flow forecasts, automated bookkeeping, intelligent payment routing, and AI-driven credit underwriting. This AI-first banking thesis is the negotiation anchor.

Mercury operates with a lean engineering team relative to its user base, meaning each engineer's output is disproportionately high-impact. The company is remote-first with hubs in SF and NYC, and comp bands are adjusted by location tier. If you're in a lower cost-of-living area, push for SF-tier equity to compensate — Mercury's equity has real pre-IPO upside given the company's revenue growth and profitability trajectory.

### AI Banking Automation Lever

Mercury is investing heavily in AI-powered banking features that differentiate it from every other neobank. AI-generated financial insights, automated categorization, and intelligent cash management are not nice-to-haves — they're the features that convince CFOs to move their primary banking relationship to Mercury. Engineers building these AI features are directly driving Mercury's competitive moat.

If you have experience with financial ML, LLM integration, or automated financial workflows, you carry a premium. Mercury is competing with Brex, Ramp, and traditional banks for this talent, and the company's lean team means each AI engineer has outsized ownership.

**Global Levers**

1. **Lean Team Impact Multiplier:** "Mercury's engineering team is lean relative to its 200K+ customer base. Each engineer I replace would require significant hiring effort. My impact-per-engineer ratio is higher here than at larger companies — comp should reflect that."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Mercury's profitability trajectory and $3.5B+ valuation create a compelling IPO path. I want the equity grant sized for the IPO scenario — $200K+ over 4 years — because I'm betting my liquid comp on Mercury's trajectory."
3. **AI Banking Differentiation:** "Mercury's AI features are the competitive moat against Brex and traditional banks. I'm building the AI capabilities that justify Mercury's valuation premium over commodity banking infrastructure."
4. **Remote Equity Parity:** "If I'm remote, I expect equity parity with SF-based engineers. My code ships the same features regardless of my ZIP code, and the equity should reflect output, not location."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $200K over 4 years with a $15K signing bonus. Mercury's lean team means I'll own more surface area than I would at a larger company — and the AI banking features I build directly drive customer acquisition and retention." Mercury will counter at $160K-$185K equity — accept at $175K+ with the signing bonus.
