**Negotiation DNA**

Security engineers at Mercury protect a banking platform holding billions of dollars in customer deposits. This is not enterprise SaaS security — a breach at Mercury means direct financial loss for 200K+ businesses. Mercury is a chartered bank (through partner banks), which means security practices must meet OCC, FDIC, and state banking regulator requirements in addition to standard SOC 2 and PCI DSS frameworks. The regulatory surface area for banking security is significantly larger than for typical fintech companies.

Mercury's remote-first model adds a security dimension: securing a distributed workforce that manages banking infrastructure requires zero-trust architecture, robust access controls, and continuous monitoring across a geographically dispersed team. Security engineers who understand both banking regulation and cloud-native security architecture are rare — and Mercury needs both. [Source: Mercury Security & Compliance Team 2025-2026]

### AI Security Lever

Mercury's AI features introduce new security vectors: adversarial attacks on ML models, prompt injection in AI assistants, and data poisoning in training pipelines. Security engineers who understand AI security threats — and can design defenses that protect financial models — are the newest and rarest specialty in banking security. If you bring AI security expertise alongside traditional banking security skills, you're in the top 1% of candidates.

The intersection of banking security and AI security is so new that market comp data barely exists. Use this ambiguity to your advantage — there's no ceiling on what this role should pay because the market hasn't established one yet.

**Global Levers**

1. **Banking-Grade Security:** "I protect a platform holding billions in customer deposits. A breach means direct financial loss for 200K+ businesses and regulatory enforcement action. My comp should reflect the catastrophic risk I'm mitigating."
2. **Multi-Regulatory Compliance:** "I manage security across OCC, FDIC, SOC 2, PCI DSS, and state banking regulations simultaneously. This regulatory surface area exceeds what most security roles require."
3. **AI Security Expertise:** "Mercury's AI features introduce novel security vectors — adversarial ML attacks, prompt injection, data poisoning. I bring AI security expertise that protects Mercury's AI products. This specialty barely exists in the market."
4. **Remote-First Banking Security:** "I secure banking infrastructure in a remote-first environment. Zero-trust architecture, distributed access controls, and continuous monitoring across a remote workforce — this is more complex than securing a co-located team."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $255K over 4 years with a $28K signing bonus. I protect billions in deposits while also securing Mercury's AI features against novel threats. This dual banking-plus-AI security expertise is exceptionally rare." Mercury will counter at $200K-$235K equity — accept at $225K+ with the signing bonus.
