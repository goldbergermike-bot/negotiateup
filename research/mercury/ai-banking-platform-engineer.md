**Negotiation DNA**

This is Mercury's signature role for 2026 — the AI Banking Platform Engineer. You're building the AI infrastructure that transforms Mercury from a beautifully designed banking UI into an intelligent financial operating system. This role combines LLM orchestration (powering Mercury's AI financial assistant), ML model serving (credit underwriting, fraud detection, cash flow forecasting), financial data engineering (real-time feature pipelines from banking transactions), and regulated AI governance (explainability, fairness, audit trails). No other company has this exact role because no other company is building AI-first banking infrastructure at Mercury's scale with Mercury's product quality bar.

Mercury's AI banking strategy is the company's primary thesis for IPO-level valuation. The platform you build determines whether Mercury is valued as a neobank ($5-10B) or as an AI-powered financial platform ($15-25B+). Every AI feature you ship, every model you deploy, and every infrastructure decision you make directly shapes Mercury's valuation narrative. Engineers on this platform are Mercury's most strategic hires. [Source: Mercury AI/ML Team, Product Strategy 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Mercury AI Platform Eng (Senior) = Google L4-L5 ML Platform = Stripe L3-L4 ML Infra = Brex Senior AI

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The AI Banking Platform Engineer builds systems that are fundamentally different from traditional ML engineering:
- **LLM Financial Assistant:** Building the orchestration layer for Mercury's AI-powered financial copilot that helps CFOs understand and manage their finances
- **Credit Model Serving:** Deploying and monitoring credit underwriting models that make real lending decisions under regulatory constraints
- **Real-Time Financial Intelligence:** Building the inference pipeline that transforms every transaction into actionable financial insights
- **Regulated AI Governance:** Engineering the explainability, fairness monitoring, and audit infrastructure required for AI in banking

**Global Levers**

1. **Valuation-Defining Platform:** "I'm building the AI platform that determines whether Mercury is valued as a neobank or as an AI-powered financial platform. That valuation difference is $10B+. My equity should reflect the platform bet I'm enabling."
2. **No-Equivalent-Role Scarcity:** "This role — AI platform engineering for a banking product — doesn't exist at other companies. There's no direct comp benchmark, which means Mercury can't low-ball me with market data. I'm defining the market rate."
3. **AI Banking Premium (15-30%):** "I'm building the AI infrastructure that powers Mercury's financial intelligence. This isn't generic ML ops — it's regulated financial AI that makes real money decisions. I want the full 30% AI banking premium applied."
4. **Production Financial AI Expertise:** "I've deployed production ML models that make financial decisions. Mercury gets regulatory-ready AI expertise from day one — no 6-month ramp learning how to build explainable, fair models in a regulated environment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the AI platform that defines Mercury's valuation narrative. I'd like the RSU grant at $420K over 4 years, with the AI Banking premium fully applied, plus a $45K signing bonus to offset pre-IPO illiquidity. I also want a guaranteed first-year refresh and the latest 409A valuation to properly evaluate the equity." Mercury will counter at $340K-$380K RSUs — accept at $360K+ with the signing bonus and 409A transparency. This is Mercury's highest-leverage engineering role.
