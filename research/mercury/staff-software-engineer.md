**Negotiation DNA**

Staff engineers at Mercury set the technical direction for the entire banking platform. Given Mercury's lean team (roughly 400 employees total as of early 2026), staff engineers have an outsized influence on architecture, tooling, and engineering culture. You're not one of 50 staff engineers — you're one of a handful who shape the technical strategy for a platform processing billions of dollars in transactions annually. This scarcity of staff-level peers means your decisions carry more weight than at larger companies.

Mercury is at the inflection point where its founding technical decisions need to evolve for the next order of magnitude of scale. The banking ledger, payment processing pipeline, and compliance infrastructure were built for thousands of customers — they need to scale to millions. Staff engineers who can lead these platform migrations while maintaining production reliability for 200K+ existing customers are exactly what Mercury needs. Frame yourself as the person who gets Mercury from "Series C infrastructure" to "IPO-ready infrastructure." [Source: Mercury Engineering, Blind Reports 2025-2026]

### AI Banking Platform Architecture Lever

At the staff level, you're defining Mercury's AI architecture — the model serving infrastructure, feature stores, LLM orchestration patterns, and data pipelines that power AI features across every Mercury product. These architectural decisions determine whether Mercury's AI capabilities scale elegantly or become a maintenance burden. You're making platform bets that affect the next 3-5 years of product development.

If you've designed ML/AI platforms at scale before, you're eliminating Mercury's biggest architectural risk. Frame your experience as de-risking Mercury's AI-first strategy — the difference between getting the AI architecture right and wrong is measured in years of engineering velocity.

**Global Levers**

1. **Technical Direction Scarcity:** "I'm one of a handful of staff engineers at Mercury. My architecture decisions affect every product team. This scarcity of staff-level peers means my influence is proportionally larger than at Google or Meta — and my equity should reflect that."
2. **Scale Transition Leadership:** "Mercury needs to scale from 200K to millions of customers. I'm leading the platform migration from Series C infrastructure to IPO-ready infrastructure. This transition leadership is worth a premium over steady-state engineering."
3. **AI Platform Architecture:** "I'm designing the ML/AI platform that powers Mercury's AI-first strategy. Getting this architecture right determines 3-5 years of product velocity. My equity should reflect the strategic value of these platform decisions."
4. **Competing Offers Leverage:** "At the staff level, I have options at Stripe, Plaid, and Big Tech with liquid RSUs. Mercury's private equity needs to offer a 1.5-2x premium to compensate for illiquidity risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $470K over 4 years with a $45K signing bonus. I'm leading Mercury's technical evolution from growth-stage to IPO-ready infrastructure — and defining the AI platform architecture that powers your competitive differentiation. I also want the latest 409A valuation and clarity on IPO timeline." Mercury will counter at $380K-$430K equity — accept at $410K+ with the signing bonus.
