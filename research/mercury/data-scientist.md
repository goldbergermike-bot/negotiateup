### Data Scientist | Mercury Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Pre-IPO Upside | AI-First Banking Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$200K | $155K–$250K | 10–15% | $205K–$275K |

| Remote (US) | $145K–$182K | $135K–$218K | 10–15% | $185K–$248K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data scientists at Mercury work with a proprietary financial dataset: transaction data, cash flow patterns, and financial behaviors of 200K+ startups. This dataset is uniquely valuable because it captures the complete financial lifecycle of high-growth companies — from seed-stage startups burning cash to profitable businesses scaling operations. Models built on this data power Mercury's credit underwriting, fraud detection, and AI-powered financial insights.

Mercury's data science work has direct business impact: your credit risk models determine who gets Mercury's credit products, your fraud detection models protect real money, and your financial insight models drive product engagement and retention. This is not analytics — it's core product data science where model quality directly determines revenue and risk. [Source: Mercury Data & Analytics Team 2025-2026]

### AI Banking Intelligence Lever

Mercury's AI-powered financial tools — cash flow forecasting, automated categorization, intelligent alerts — are powered by data science models trained on the company's proprietary startup financial data. Data scientists building these models are directly creating Mercury's AI product differentiation. Every model improvement translates to better financial insights for customers, which translates to higher engagement and lower churn.

If you have experience with financial forecasting, time-series modeling, or credit risk, you're building the exact models Mercury needs for its AI banking strategy. The combination of financial modeling expertise and modern ML skills is rare in the market.

**Global Levers**

1. **Proprietary Dataset Access:** "Mercury's startup financial dataset is unique — no one else has this view of the financial lifecycle of 200K+ high-growth companies. My models leverage data that competitors can't replicate."
2. **Credit Risk Revenue Impact:** "My credit risk models determine who gets Mercury's credit products. Better models mean more approved customers with lower default rates — directly driving revenue and reducing losses."
3. **Financial Forecasting Expertise:** "I bring financial time-series modeling expertise that directly powers Mercury's AI cash flow forecasting. This combination of financial domain knowledge and ML skills is rare."
4. **AI Product Differentiation:** "My models power the AI features that differentiate Mercury from Brex and traditional banks. Model quality directly determines product quality and customer retention."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $235K over 4 years with a $22K signing bonus. My models directly power Mercury's AI product strategy and credit underwriting — both core revenue drivers. The equity should reflect the business impact of my model work." Mercury will counter at $185K-$215K equity — accept at $205K+ with the signing bonus.
