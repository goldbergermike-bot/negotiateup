### Senior Software Engineer | Mercury Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Pre-IPO Upside | AI-First Banking Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $190K–$235K | $210K–$340K | 10–15% | $248K–$330K |
| New York | $185K–$230K | $200K–$325K | 10–15% | $240K–$320K |
| Remote (US) | $175K–$215K | $185K–$300K | 10–15% | $225K–$298K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior engineers at Mercury own entire product surfaces — the banking dashboard, payment rails, credit products, or AI-powered financial tools. Mercury's engineering culture emphasizes craft and product taste: you're expected to make product decisions, not just implement specs. This means senior engineers have more autonomy (and more accountability) than at larger companies. The company's remote-first culture means you're evaluated on output, not presence — which works in your favor if you're a high-output engineer.

Mercury's competitive advantage is that it's both a bank and a software company. Senior engineers who understand financial infrastructure (ACH, wire transfers, ledger systems) alongside modern software development (React, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails) are rare. If you bring banking domain expertise, you eliminate Mercury's biggest onboarding risk: the 3-6 month learning curve on regulated financial systems. Negotiate the value of that eliminated ramp time.

### AI Financial Intelligence Lever

Mercury's 2026 product roadmap is AI-heavy: intelligent cash flow forecasting, AI-powered bookkeeping, automated spend categorization, and LLM-driven financial insights. Senior engineers building these features are creating the product differentiation that justifies Mercury's premium positioning against Brex, Ramp, and traditional banks. This isn't AI for AI's sake — it's AI that directly saves CFOs hours per week and influences banking relationship decisions.

If you have experience with financial ML, LLM application development, or automated financial workflows, you're in the highest-demand segment of Mercury's hiring. Frame your AI experience as directly translatable to Mercury's product roadmap.

**Global Levers**

1. **Product Craft Autonomy:** "Mercury's engineering culture gives senior engineers product decision authority. I'm not just implementing specs — I'm shaping the product. This autonomy comes with accountability, and my comp should reflect both."
2. **Banking Domain Expertise:** "I understand ACH, wire transfers, and ledger systems. This eliminates Mercury's biggest onboarding risk — the 3-6 month learning curve on regulated financial infrastructure. That ramp-time savings is worth a premium."
3. **AI Product Differentiation:** "Mercury's AI features are the competitive moat. I'm building the intelligent financial tools that convince CFOs to switch from Chase to Mercury. My equity should reflect the customer acquisition my features drive."
4. **Pre-IPO Profitability Signal:** "Mercury is near-profitable with strong revenue growth. This de-risks the equity — I'm joining a company with a real path to IPO, not a cash-burning startup. I want the equity sized to reflect this favorable risk profile."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $320K over 4 years with a $25K signing bonus. I'm a senior engineer with both financial domain expertise and AI product experience — the exact combination Mercury needs for its 2026 AI banking strategy. The equity should reflect this dual-expertise premium." Mercury will counter at $260K-$300K equity — accept at $280K+ with the signing bonus.
