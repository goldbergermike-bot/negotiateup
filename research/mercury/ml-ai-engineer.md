### ML/AI Engineer | Mercury Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Pre-IPO Upside | AI-First Banking Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $180K–$230K | $195K–$330K | 10–15% | $238K–$320K |
| New York | $175K–$225K | $190K–$315K | 10–15% | $232K–$312K |
| Remote (US) | $165K–$210K | $170K–$290K | 10–15% | $215K–$290K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI engineers at Mercury are building the intelligence layer of the entire banking platform. Your models power credit underwriting (determining who gets Mercury's credit products), fraud detection (protecting billions in deposits), cash flow forecasting (giving startups visibility into their financial future), and automated financial operations (categorization, reconciliation, anomaly detection). This isn't experimental AI — it's production ML that processes real money and makes real financial decisions.

Mercury's AI-first strategy means ML/AI engineers are the company's highest-priority technical hires in 2026. The company is embedding AI into every product surface, and each model improvement translates directly to better product experiences and defensible competitive advantages. Mercury competes for AI talent against Brex (AI spend management), Ramp (AI procurement), and Big Tech — all offering competitive packages. Mercury's advantage is the unique dataset and the product ownership that comes with a lean team. [Source: Mercury AI/ML Team 2025-2026]

### AI Banking Model Architecture Lever

Mercury's AI banking strategy requires models that operate under financial-grade constraints: explainability (regulators require it for credit decisions), fairness (bias testing for lending), real-time latency (fraud detection in milliseconds), and accuracy (financial forecasts that CFOs trust enough to make decisions on). Building models that satisfy all four constraints simultaneously is the core ML challenge at Mercury.

If you have experience with financial ML — credit risk modeling, fraud detection, or financial forecasting — you carry a premium that Mercury will pay. The combination of ML engineering skills and financial domain knowledge eliminates the 6-month ramp that generalist ML engineers need to understand regulated financial model development.

**Global Levers**

1. **Production Financial ML:** "My models make real financial decisions — credit approvals, fraud blocks, cash flow forecasts. This production financial ML experience directly translates to Mercury's AI strategy."
2. **Regulatory ML Expertise:** "I build models that are explainable, fair, and auditable. Financial regulators require this, and it's a skill most ML engineers don't have. Mercury gets regulatory-ready ML expertise from day one."
3. **Unique Dataset Leverage:** "Mercury's startup financial dataset is unmatched. The models I build on this data will create capabilities no competitor can replicate — and my equity should reflect the unique value I create."
4. **AI-First Company Premium:** "Mercury has publicly committed to being AI-first. ML engineers are the highest-priority hires. I want the comp to reflect this priority — not the market rate for generic ML roles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $310K over 4 years with a $30K signing bonus. My models directly determine who gets Mercury's credit products, which transactions get flagged as fraud, and which AI features drive customer retention. This is core business-impact ML — and the comp should match." Mercury will counter at $250K-$290K equity — accept at $275K+ with the signing bonus.
