### Product Designer | Mercury Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Pre-IPO Upside | AI-First Banking Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $150K–$190K | $125K–$200K | 10–15% | $185K–$250K |
| New York | $145K–$185K | $120K–$195K | 10–15% | $180K–$242K |
| Remote (US) | $135K–$172K | $110K–$178K | 10–15% | $168K–$225K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product designers at Mercury are the reason startups choose Mercury over Chase. The company's design quality is a primary competitive advantage — Mercury's banking dashboard, payment flows, and financial tools are widely recognized as the best-designed banking products in the market. This means designers carry more organizational influence at Mercury than at most companies. Your design decisions directly drive customer acquisition and retention.

Mercury's design team is deliberately small, which means each designer owns a disproportionately large product surface. You'll design banking dashboards, payment flows, credit product experiences, and AI-powered financial tools — all while maintaining the design consistency and craft quality that defines Mercury's brand. The 2026 design challenge is integrating AI capabilities (forecasts, automated insights, AI copilot) into financial workflows without overwhelming users or reducing trust.

### AI Banking Experience Design Lever

Designing AI features for banking requires a unique skill: making AI outputs feel trustworthy in a context where users are making financial decisions. An AI cash flow forecast that's wrong doesn't just create a bad experience — it can cause a startup to mismanage their runway. Designers who understand how to communicate AI uncertainty, build appropriate trust calibration, and create graceful fallbacks for AI errors are exceptionally valuable.

If you have experience designing AI-powered products, especially in trust-critical domains (finance, healthcare, legal), you carry a premium. The intersection of AI UX design and financial product design is the hottest niche in the design market.

**Global Levers**

1. **Design as Competitive Moat:** "Mercury's design quality is the #1 reason startups choose it over traditional banks. I'm directly contributing to Mercury's primary competitive advantage. My comp should reflect the customer acquisition my design drives."
2. **Surface Area Ownership:** "Mercury's design team is small. I'll own more product surface area than I would at a larger company — which means my design decisions have outsized impact on the user experience and brand."
3. **AI Trust Design Expertise:** "I design AI features where users make financial decisions based on AI outputs. Building appropriate trust calibration and communicating AI uncertainty in financial contexts is a rare skill."
4. **Financial Product Craft:** "I understand how to design complex financial workflows — payment flows, credit applications, treasury management — that feel simple. This financial design expertise takes years to develop."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $185K over 4 years with a $18K signing bonus. Mercury's design quality is its competitive moat, and I'm directly extending that moat into AI-powered financial experiences." Mercury will counter at $150K-$175K equity — accept at $165K+ with the signing bonus.
