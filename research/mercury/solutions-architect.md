**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions architects at Mercury design integration architectures for businesses migrating their banking relationships to the platform. This isn't standard API integration — you're helping CFOs and finance teams move their company's operating capital, payroll systems, and vendor payment workflows from legacy banks to Mercury. The stakes are high: a poorly designed migration can disrupt a company's ability to pay employees and vendors. Your technical credibility directly determines whether enterprise prospects become Mercury customers.

Mercury is moving upmarket from startup customers to larger SMBs and mid-market companies. These customers have more complex banking needs (multi-entity structures, AP/AR automation, treasury management) and require dedicated technical support during migration. Solutions architects who can design these enterprise migrations while maintaining Mercury's product simplicity are essential to the company's revenue growth strategy.

### AI Banking Integration Lever

Mercury's AI features create new integration opportunities: AI-powered financial insights can be piped into customers' ERP systems, automated categorization can sync with accounting software, and AI-generated forecasts can feed into corporate planning tools. Solutions architects who can design these AI-enabled integrations — connecting Mercury's AI outputs to customers' existing financial workflows — directly expand Mercury's value proposition and contract sizes.

If you have experience integrating AI/ML products into enterprise financial workflows, you're in a niche that barely exists in the market. Use this scarcity to negotiate aggressively.

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Revenue Attribution:** "I directly enable enterprise customer migrations that represent $100K-$1M+ in annual deposit relationships. My technical credibility determines whether prospects become customers."
2. **Banking Migration Expertise:** "I design migrations of operating capital, payroll, and vendor payments from legacy banks to Mercury. The stakes — companies need to pay employees — mean my migration designs must be flawless."
3. **AI Integration Design:** "I design integrations that connect Mercury's AI features to customers' ERP, accounting, and planning tools. These AI-enabled integrations increase Mercury's value per customer and expand deal sizes."
4. **Upmarket Motion Enablement:** "Mercury's enterprise expansion depends on solutions architects who can handle complex banking needs. I'm the technical credibility that enables Mercury's upmarket revenue growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $240K over 4 years with a $22K signing bonus and clarity on commission or deal-based bonuses. I directly enable enterprise customer acquisition, and my comp should include variable components tied to the deals I influence." Mercury will counter at $190K-$225K equity — accept at $210K+ with the signing bonus and variable comp clarity.
