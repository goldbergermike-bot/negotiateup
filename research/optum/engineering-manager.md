### Engineering Manager | Optum Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** UHG Tech/Analytics Subsidiary / Higher Comp Than Parent / People Leadership Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Eden Prairie MN | $170K–$225K | $90K–$220K/4yr | 15–25% | $240K–$365K |
| Dallas TX | $165K–$220K | $85K–$210K/4yr | 15–25% | $235K–$355K |
| Remote US | $160K–$210K | $80K–$200K/4yr | 15–25% | $225K–$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Optum lead teams building healthcare technology products that generate direct revenue. Unlike UHG parent (where engineering often supports internal operations), Optum EMs lead product engineering teams building OptumRx, OptumInsight, OptumHealth, and Optum Financial platforms. This product-engineering context means Optum EMs are evaluated on product delivery, team velocity, revenue impact, and talent retention — not just project completion. Optum EMs earn 15-25% more than UHG parent EMs and have higher bonus targets (15-25% vs 15-20%). The role spans people management, technical strategy, product partnership, and organizational scaling in a matrixed environment that requires navigating Optum's business units and UHG's enterprise governance.

**Level Mapping:** Optum T5-T6 EM = Google L5-L6 EM = Meta M1-M2 = UHG EM + 15-25% comp

**Global Levers**

1. **Product Revenue Ownership:** "My team delivers revenue-generating products, not internal tools. The bonus and RSU should reflect product-engineering management with direct revenue attribution, not cost-center IT management."
2. **Optum EM Premium:** "Optum EMs are benchmarked 15-25% above UHG parent EMs. I need to confirm this offer reflects the Optum management band with the full premium."
3. **Bonus Target Maximization:** "Optum EMs have bonus targets of 15-25%. Given the product scope and revenue impact of the team I'll lead, I'm targeting 25% — the top of the management bonus band."
4. **Retention Cost Economics:** "Attrition on my team costs Optum $150K-$250K per engineer in recruiting and ramp. My leadership directly reduces this cost. The incremental comp I'm requesting is a fraction of the retention value I'll deliver."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $220K with RSUs at $200K/4yr and a 25% bonus target. My experience managing product engineering teams that delivered [specific revenue outcomes] at [current company] directly translates to Optum's product-focused engineering culture." Optum will counter at $185K-$205K base with $110K-$170K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $300K. The bonus target is the most flexible lever — push for 25%.
