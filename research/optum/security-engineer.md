### Security Engineer | Optum Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** UHG Tech/Analytics Subsidiary / Higher Comp Than Parent / Post-Breach Security Urgency

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Eden Prairie MN | $150K–$205K | $65K–$170K/4yr | 12–20% | $195K–$305K |
| Dallas TX | $145K–$200K | $60K–$160K/4yr | 12–20% | $190K–$295K |
| Remote US | $140K–$190K | $55K–$150K/4yr | 12–20% | $180K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Optum protect healthcare technology products and data infrastructure that serve 150M+ members and thousands of external healthcare clients. The 2024 Change Healthcare breach elevated security to a board-level priority across all of UHG, and Optum — as the technology arm — is where most of the security investment is being deployed. Security engineers at Optum work across application security, cloud security (Azure/AWS), infrastructure security, identity and access management, threat detection, and incident response — all within HIPAA/HITRUST compliance requirements. Optum pays 15-25% more than UHG parent for security roles, and the post-breach urgency has pushed Optum to exceed even its own historical security bands. Healthcare security engineering is one of the most in-demand specializations, with a global shortage amplified by healthcare-specific regulatory complexity.

**Level Mapping:** Optum T4-T5 Security = Google L4-L5 Security = CrowdStrike Mid-Senior = UHG Security + 15-25% comp

**Global Levers**

1. **Post-Breach Investment Urgency:** "The Change Healthcare breach made Optum security a board-level priority with unprecedented budget allocation. Security engineers hired now are part of a generational security transformation — the urgency premium should be fully reflected in comp."
2. **Healthcare Security Specialization:** "I combine cloud security engineering with HIPAA/HITRUST compliance expertise. This dual skillset is rare — most security engineers know cloud, or they know healthcare compliance, but rarely both at production depth."
3. **Optum Security Premium Stack:** "The 15-25% Optum premium over UHG parent should stack with the post-breach security urgency premium. I'm comparing against CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Zscaler — pure security companies that pay aggressively."
4. **Product Security Revenue Link:** "Optum's products handle PHI for external clients. A security incident doesn't just mean regulatory fines — it means lost client revenue and destroyed trust. My security work directly protects Optum's product revenue stream."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Given the post-Change Healthcare security priority, I'd like the base at $200K with RSUs at $150K/4yr and a 20% bonus target. My healthcare security experience — specifically [application security / cloud security / incident response] with HIPAA compliance at [current company] — addresses Optum's most urgent security needs." Optum will counter at $165K-$185K base with $85K-$125K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $260K. Push on both base and RSU — security is where Optum is most willing to exceed bands.
