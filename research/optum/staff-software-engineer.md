### Staff Software Engineer | Optum Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** UHG Tech/Analytics Subsidiary / Higher Comp Than Parent / Staff IC Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Eden Prairie MN | $185K–$240K | $120K–$250K/4yr | 15–25% | $260K–$400K |
| Dallas TX | $180K–$235K | $115K–$240K/4yr | 15–25% | $255K–$390K |
| Remote US | $175K–$225K | $110K–$230K/4yr | 15–25% | $245K–$375K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Optum are the pinnacle of the IC technical career ladder, driving cross-team architecture, platform strategy, and technical vision across Optum's multi-billion dollar technology portfolio. At this level, engineers influence architectural decisions spanning OptumRx (pharmacy), OptumInsight (analytics SaaS), OptumHealth (care delivery), and Optum Financial (payments) — each a major business unit in its own right. Optum's Staff engineers are expected to set technical direction for 50-100+ engineers, lead architecture review boards, make strategic build-vs-buy decisions, and represent Optum's technical perspective to UHG's enterprise architecture council. The comp premium over UHG parent is most pronounced at the Staff level — Optum T6-T7 engineers can earn 20-30% more than equivalent UHG Staff roles because Optum positions these roles as tech-company-equivalent leadership positions.

**Level Mapping:** Optum T6-T7 Staff SWE = Google L5-L6 = Meta E5-E6 = Microsoft Principal = UHG Staff + 20-30% comp

**Global Levers**

1. **Tech Company Parity:** "At the Staff level, I'm comparing Optum against Google, Microsoft, and health tech companies like Veeva and Tempus — not against UHG parent. Optum's T6-T7 band should be competitive with Big Tech L5-L6, especially in the RSU component."
2. **Cross-Business Unit Architecture Impact:** "I'll be setting technical direction across multiple Optum business units — each a multi-billion dollar P&L. This cross-organizational architectural influence is equivalent to VP-of-Engineering scope at a smaller company."
3. **IC-vs-Manager Parity Push:** "Engineering Directors at Optum earn $300K-$450K+ TC. The Staff IC track should offer parity — I'm providing equivalent strategic impact without the management overhead. Push the RSU grant to close any gap."
4. **Platform Decision Economics:** "At the Staff level, my build-vs-buy recommendations and architectural choices affect tens of millions in annual technology spend. The ROI on a well-compensated Staff engineer making correct platform decisions dwarfs the comp differential."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $235K with RSUs at $230K/4yr and a 25% bonus target. My Staff-level experience leading cross-team architecture at [current company] — specifically [platform/initiative] — translates directly to Optum's T6-T7 scope." Optum will counter at $195K-$220K base with $140K-$200K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $340K. Push hardest on the RSU grant — it's where Optum has the most flexibility at the Staff level.
