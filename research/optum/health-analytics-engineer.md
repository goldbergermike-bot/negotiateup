### Health Analytics Engineer | Optum Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** UHG Tech/Analytics Subsidiary / Higher Comp Than Parent / Data-Driven Healthcare | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+10-20% ANALYTICS PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Eden Prairie MN | $150K–$200K | $70K–$180K/4yr | 12–20% | $200K–$310K |
| Dallas TX | $145K–$195K | $65K–$170K/4yr | 12–20% | $195K–$300K |
| Remote US | $140K–$190K | $60K–$160K/4yr | 12–20% | $185K–$290K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Optum is UnitedHealth Group's technology and analytics arm, and the Health Analytics Engineer is its signature technical role. Optum processes healthcare data for 150M+ members and thousands of provider organizations, building analytics platforms that power clinical decision support, population health management, pharmacy benefit optimization, and payer risk modeling. The Health Analytics Engineer combines software engineering with statistical analysis and healthcare domain expertise — building production analytics systems, not just running queries. Optum pays 15-25% more than parent company UHG for equivalent technical roles because it positions itself as a technology company that happens to be in healthcare, not a healthcare company with a tech department. Optum competes directly with health tech companies (Veeva, Tempus), Big Tech health divisions (Google Health, Microsoft Health), and consulting analytics firms for talent. The role requires proficiency in distributed data systems (Spark, Databricks), statistical programming (Python, R), and healthcare data standards (HL7 FHIR, claims data models).

**Level Mapping:** Optum T5 Health Analytics Engineer = Google L4-L5 Data Engineer = Databricks Senior = Palantir Forward Deployed Engineer

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Health Analytics Engineer at Optum sits at the intersection of engineering and analytics:
- **Production Analytics Platforms:** Building systems that serve real-time analytics to clinicians, payers, and patients — not just dashboards, but decision-support engines
- **Healthcare Data Mastery:** Working with the largest integrated healthcare dataset in the US — claims, clinical, pharmacy, lab, and social determinants of health data
- **OptumInsight Products:** Analytics that Optum sells as products to external healthcare organizations — your work IS the revenue
- **Population Health Scale:** Building analytics that identify at-risk populations, predict disease trajectories, and optimize care interventions across millions of members

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue-Generating Analytics Frame:** "OptumInsight sells analytics as a product — my engineering work directly generates revenue. This isn't cost-center analytics; it's product analytics with direct ARR impact. My comp should reflect the revenue attribution."
2. **Parent Company Uplift:** "Optum intentionally benchmarks 15-25% above UHG parent for technical roles. I'm choosing Optum specifically for the tech-company comp structure — the offer should clearly reflect the Optum premium, not the UHG parent band."
3. **Healthcare Analytics Scarcity:** "Engineers who can build production analytics systems AND understand healthcare data models (claims adjudication, clinical coding, pharmacy benefits) are exceptionally rare. My dual expertise eliminates the 12-month domain ramp-up."
4. **Data Asset Leverage:** "Optum's healthcare dataset is its most valuable asset — arguably the most comprehensive in the world. I'm building the infrastructure that makes this data asset actionable and monetizable. The strategic value of this work justifies top-of-band compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $195K with RSUs at $160K/4yr and a 20% bonus target. My health analytics engineering experience — building production analytics platforms using healthcare claims and clinical data at [current company] — means I'm productive on Optum's analytics platform from week one." Optum will counter at $165K-$185K base with $90K-$130K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $260K. Push on both RSU and bonus — Optum has more equity flexibility than parent UHG.
