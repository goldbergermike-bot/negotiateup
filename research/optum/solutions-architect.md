**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Optum design end-to-end technical solutions for healthcare products and platform integrations. The role bridges client-facing product requirements and internal engineering implementation — designing architectures for OptumInsight analytics deployments, OptumRx pharmacy integrations, OptumHealth provider platform configurations, and cross-business-unit data flows. Solutions Architects at Optum must be fluent in healthcare interoperability standards (HL7 FHIR, X12 EDI, NCPDP), cloud architecture (Azure/AWS), enterprise integration patterns, and API design. Optum's SA role is particularly complex because architectures must serve both internal UHG needs and external client deployments — requiring multi-tenant, HIPAA-compliant, scalable design. Optum pays 15-20% above UHG parent for SA roles. [Source: Optum Enterprise Architecture 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Optum T5 Solutions Architect = Google L5 Solutions = AWS Senior SA = UHG SA + 15-20% comp

**Global Levers**

1. **Client-Facing Product Architecture:** "My architectures aren't just internal — they're deployed to external healthcare clients. Every architectural decision impacts client satisfaction, product scalability, and revenue retention. This client-facing scope commands premium comp."
2. **Healthcare Interoperability Mastery:** "I bring deep HL7 FHIR, X12 EDI, and healthcare integration expertise. Optum's CMS interoperability compliance timelines require architects who can design compliant solutions now — not after 12 months of domain training."
3. **Multi-Tenant HIPAA Architecture:** "Designing multi-tenant healthcare platforms with PHI isolation, HIPAA compliance, and regulatory audit capabilities is uniquely complex. This specialized architectural expertise justifies top-of-band comp."
4. **Optum SA Premium:** "Optum SA roles are benchmarked 15-20% above UHG parent. The offer should clearly reflect the Optum architecture band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with RSUs at $155K/4yr and a 20% bonus target. My healthcare solutions architecture experience — designing [FHIR integrations / multi-tenant platforms / analytics deployments] at [current company] — directly maps to Optum's product architecture needs." Optum will counter at $170K-$190K base with $90K-$130K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $260K. Push on RSU — solutions architects have strong equity leverage at Optum.
