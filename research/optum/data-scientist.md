### Data Scientist | Optum Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** UHG Tech/Analytics Subsidiary / Higher Comp Than Parent / Healthcare Analytics Core

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Eden Prairie MN | $145K–$195K | $60K–$155K/4yr | 12–18% | $185K–$290K |
| Dallas TX | $140K–$190K | $55K–$145K/4yr | 12–18% | $180K–$280K |
| Remote US | $135K–$185K | $50K–$140K/4yr | 12–18% | $170K–$270K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Optum are central to the company's value proposition — Optum IS healthcare analytics. The role spans predictive modeling for member risk stratification, pharmacy benefit optimization, provider quality scoring, clinical outcome prediction, fraud/waste/abuse detection, and population health management. Optum's data science organization is one of the largest in healthcare, with hundreds of data scientists building models that directly impact clinical and financial outcomes for 150M+ members. The comp premium over UHG parent is clear: Optum data scientists earn 15-20% more because their models are productized and sold through OptumInsight. Data scientists must combine statistical expertise (survival analysis, causal inference, Bayesian methods, time-series) with healthcare domain knowledge and production deployment skills. Optum competes with health tech (Tempus, Flatiron), pharma analytics (IQVIA), and Big Tech health for this talent. [Source: Optum Analytics Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Optum T4 Data Scientist = Google L4 DS = Meta IC4 DS = UHG DS + 15-20% comp

**Global Levers**

1. **Productized Analytics Frame:** "My models at Optum aren't internal reports — they're analytics products sold to healthcare organizations through OptumInsight. The revenue attribution of my modeling work should be reflected in compensation."
2. **Actuarial-Adjacent Value:** "My predictive models feed actuarial functions that determine UHG's insurance pricing and reserves. Actuaries at UHG earn $150K-$300K+. My data science work powers their models — my comp should reflect this financial adjacency."
3. **Healthcare Domain Scarcity:** "Data scientists who understand clinical risk factors, claims data structures, and pharmacy benefit optimization are scarce. Generic data scientists take 12-18 months to become productive in healthcare analytics. My domain expertise has immediate ROI."
4. **Optum vs UHG Band Check:** "Optum data science roles are benchmarked 15-20% above UHG parent. If this offer looks like a UHG DS offer, it needs to be adjusted to the Optum analytics band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $190K with RSUs at $140K/4yr and an 18% bonus target. My healthcare data science experience — specifically [risk modeling / cost prediction / clinical analytics] at [current company] — directly maps to Optum's highest-priority analytics initiatives." Optum will counter at $160K-$180K base with $80K-$115K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $240K. Push on both RSU and bonus target — data scientists at Optum have leverage on both.
