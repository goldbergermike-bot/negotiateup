### Technical Program Manager | Optum Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** UHG Tech/Analytics Subsidiary / Higher Comp Than Parent / Cross-Product Program Execution

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Eden Prairie MN | $150K–$205K | $65K–$160K/4yr | 12–20% | $195K–$300K |
| Dallas TX | $145K–$200K | $60K–$150K/4yr | 12–20% | $190K–$290K |
| Remote US | $140K–$190K | $55K–$140K/4yr | 12–20% | $180K–$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Optum drive complex, cross-functional technology programs spanning Optum's product portfolio and UHG's enterprise technology organization. Optum TPMs manage programs like product platform launches, cross-business-unit integrations, regulatory compliance implementations, and M&A technology integrations. The role requires navigating Optum's four business units (OptumRx, OptumInsight, OptumHealth, Optum Financial) plus coordinating with UHG parent and external partners. Optum TPMs earn 15-20% more than UHG parent TPMs because they manage product delivery programs with direct revenue impact — not just internal IT projects. The role demands technical fluency, healthcare domain knowledge, and exceptional stakeholder management skills. [Source: Optum Technology Program Management 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Optum T4-T5 TPM = Google L4-L5 TPM = Meta IC4-IC5 TPM = UHG TPM + 15-20% comp

**Global Levers**

1. **Product Program Revenue Link:** "I'm managing programs that deliver revenue-generating products — not internal IT projects. The program outcomes I drive directly impact Optum's product ARR and client satisfaction."
2. **Cross-Business Unit Complexity:** "Optum programs span four major business units plus UHG parent. This organizational complexity requires TPMs who can navigate matrixed healthcare organizations — a skill set developed over years, not months."
3. **Regulatory Program Urgency:** "CMS compliance programs have hard deadlines with financial penalties. I bring experience managing regulatory technology programs where delay isn't an option."
4. **Optum TPM Premium:** "Optum TPMs are benchmarked 15-20% above UHG parent. I need the offer to reflect the Optum program management band with the full premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $200K with RSUs at $140K/4yr and a 20% bonus target. My experience managing cross-functional technology programs — including [specific program with healthcare/regulatory components] at [current company] — directly maps to Optum's most complex program needs." Optum will counter at $165K-$185K base with $80K-$115K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $250K. Push on bonus target — TPMs at Optum can negotiate from 12% to 20%.
