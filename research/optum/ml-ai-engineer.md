### ML/AI Engineer | Optum Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** UHG Tech/Analytics Subsidiary / Higher Comp Than Parent | **+10-20% AI/ML PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Eden Prairie MN | $155K–$210K | $75K–$185K/4yr | 12–20% | $210K–$325K |
| Dallas TX | $150K–$205K | $70K–$175K/4yr | 12–20% | $205K–$315K |
| Remote US | $145K–$195K | $65K–$165K/4yr | 12–20% | $195K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Optum build production machine learning systems that power the largest healthcare analytics platform in the US. Optum's AI capabilities span clinical NLP (extracting insights from unstructured medical records), predictive risk modeling (identifying high-risk members before adverse events), fraud detection (identifying anomalous claims patterns across billions of transactions), pharmacy optimization (drug interaction checking, formulary optimization), and clinical decision support. Optum has invested heavily in AI/ML infrastructure, building centralized ML platforms (feature stores, model registries, inference serving) that serve models to all business units. The AI/ML premium at Optum is significant — 10-20% above standard engineering bands — because healthcare ML talent combines scarce ML engineering skills with even scarcer healthcare domain expertise. Optum competes directly with Tempus, Google Health, and pharma AI (Recursion, Insitro) for this talent. [Source: Optum AI/ML Strategy 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Optum T4-T5 ML Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML = Meta ML4-ML5 = UHG ML Engineer + 15-25% comp

**Global Levers**

1. **Healthcare ML Scarcity Stack:** "I'm in a tiny intersection of ML engineers who also understand healthcare data, HIPAA compliance, and clinical workflows. Optum's 10-20% AI premium should stack on top of the 15-25% Optum-over-UHG premium — this is the most specialized role in the organization."
2. **Productized ML Revenue:** "My models power OptumInsight analytics products sold to external healthcare organizations. This is product ML with direct revenue attribution — not internal analytics."
3. **Regulatory AI Expertise:** "CMS is mandating AI transparency and bias testing for healthcare algorithms. ML engineers who can build explainable, auditable models that satisfy regulatory requirements are critical to Optum's business continuity."
4. **Competing AI Opportunities:** "Tempus, Google Health, Microsoft Health, and pharma AI companies (Recursion, Insitro) are all hiring healthcare ML engineers at competitive rates. Optum's offer needs to beat these alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $205K with RSUs at $165K/4yr and a 20% bonus target. My healthcare ML experience — deploying production models for [risk prediction / clinical NLP / fraud detection] at [current company] — means I deliver production AI from month one." Optum will counter at $170K-$195K base with $90K-$135K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $270K. Push on both RSU and bonus — Optum has flexibility on both for ML talent.
