### Product Designer | Optum Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** UHG Tech/Analytics Subsidiary / Higher Comp Than Parent / Product Design Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Eden Prairie MN | $125K–$175K | $40K–$115K/4yr | 10–15% | $155K–$240K |
| Dallas TX | $120K–$170K | $35K–$110K/4yr | 10–15% | $150K–$230K |
| Remote US | $115K–$165K | $35K–$105K/4yr | 10–15% | $140K–$220K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Optum design experiences for healthcare products used by clinicians, patients, payers, and healthcare administrators. Unlike UHG parent (where design often supports internal member portals), Optum's designers build product experiences sold to external clients — OptumInsight analytics dashboards, OptumRx pharmacy interfaces, OptumHealth provider tools, and clinical decision-support UIs. This product-design context means Optum designers have direct product revenue impact. Healthcare UX at Optum is uniquely complex: designing for clinical workflows that must be error-resistant (medication dosing, clinical alerts), accessible to diverse user populations, HIPAA-compliant, and intuitive enough for time-pressured clinicians. Optum pays 15-20% above UHG parent for design roles. [Source: Optum Design Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Optum T3-T4 Designer = Google L3-L4 UX = Meta IC4 Design = UHG Design + 15-20% comp

**Global Levers**

1. **Product Revenue Design:** "I'm designing product experiences that Optum sells to external healthcare clients. Product design directly impacts user adoption, retention, and NPS — which drives revenue. This isn't internal tools design; it's product design with revenue attribution."
2. **Clinical UX Expertise:** "Designing for clinical workflows requires understanding error-prevention principles, clinical cognitive load, and time-pressured decision-making. Healthcare UX expertise is rare and takes years to develop — I bring it from day one."
3. **Optum Design Premium:** "Optum benchmarks design roles 15-20% above UHG parent. I need to confirm this offer reflects the Optum product design band."
4. **Health Tech Design Market:** "Health tech companies (Oscar, Hims, Ro, Tempus) and Big Tech health divisions (Google Health, Apple Health) are hiring healthcare designers at premium rates. Optum needs to compete with these employers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $170K with RSUs at $100K/4yr and a 15% bonus target. My healthcare product design portfolio — including [clinical UX / patient experience / analytics dashboard] work at [current company] — directly maps to Optum's product design needs." Optum will counter at $140K-$160K base with $55K-$85K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $195K. Push on base — design roles have less RSU flexibility.
