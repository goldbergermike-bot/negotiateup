### Data Engineer | Optum Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** UHG Tech/Analytics Subsidiary / Higher Comp Than Parent / Healthcare Data Infrastructure

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Eden Prairie MN | $140K–$190K | $55K–$145K/4yr | 10–15% | $175K–$275K |
| Dallas TX | $135K–$185K | $50K–$135K/4yr | 10–15% | $170K–$265K |
| Remote US | $130K–$180K | $45K–$130K/4yr | 10–15% | $160K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Optum build the data infrastructure that powers the most comprehensive healthcare analytics platform in the US. Optum processes and integrates claims data, clinical records, pharmacy transactions, lab results, and social determinants of health data for 150M+ members — creating a unified healthcare data asset that no competitor can replicate. Data engineers build ETL/ELT pipelines, data lakes, streaming platforms, and data quality frameworks using Spark, Databricks, Snowflake, Airflow, and Kafka. The role demands expertise in healthcare data standards (HL7 FHIR, X12 EDI, ICD-10/CPT coding) alongside distributed systems engineering. Optum pays 15-25% above UHG parent for data engineering roles because OptumInsight monetizes this data infrastructure as a product — your pipelines ARE the product.

**Level Mapping:** Optum T3-T4 Data Engineer = Google L3-L4 DE = Databricks IC3-IC4 = UHG DE + 15-25% comp

**Global Levers**

1. **Data-as-Product Frame:** "Optum sells healthcare analytics as a product. My data pipelines aren't internal cost-center infrastructure — they're the foundation of OptumInsight's revenue-generating analytics products. My comp should reflect product-engineering economics, not IT support."
2. **Optum Premium Verification:** "I need to confirm this offer is on Optum's data engineering band, not UHG parent. The 15-25% Optum premium should be clearly reflected in the base and RSU."
3. **Healthcare Data Standards Expertise:** "I bring expertise in HL7 FHIR, X12 EDI, and healthcare claims data models. Optum can't train a general data engineer on healthcare data standards in less than 12 months — my domain expertise has immediate value."
4. **Data Asset Strategic Value:** "Optum's integrated healthcare dataset is arguably the most valuable healthcare data asset in the world. I'm building the infrastructure that makes this asset queryable, reliable, and monetizable. The strategic importance justifies top-of-band comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $185K with RSUs at $130K/4yr and a 15% bonus target. My healthcare data engineering experience with [claims/clinical/pharmacy data] at [current company] means I'm productive on Optum's data platform from week one." Optum will counter at $155K-$175K base with $70K-$105K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $220K. Push on base salary — healthcare data engineering expertise is the strongest base negotiation lever.
