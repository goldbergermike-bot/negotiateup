### Software Engineer | Optum Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** UHG Tech/Analytics Subsidiary / Higher Comp Than Parent / Tech-Company Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Eden Prairie MN | $135K–$185K | $50K–$135K/4yr | 10–15% | $170K–$265K |
| Dallas TX | $130K–$180K | $45K–$125K/4yr | 10–15% | $165K–$255K |
| Remote US | $125K–$175K | $40K–$120K/4yr | 10–15% | $155K–$245K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Optum is the technology, analytics, and care delivery arm of UnitedHealth Group — and it intentionally positions itself as a tech company within healthcare, not a healthcare company with engineers. Software Engineers at Optum build platforms spanning OptumRx (pharmacy benefits for 60M+ members), OptumInsight (healthcare analytics SaaS sold to external clients), OptumHealth (care delivery technology), and Optum Financial (healthcare payments). Optum pays 15-25% more than parent company UHG for equivalent SWE roles, which is a critical negotiation fact — if your initial offer looks like a UHG offer, it's probably underpriced for Optum bands. Optum's engineering culture emphasizes modern tech stacks (cloud-native, microservices, Kubernetes), agile delivery, and product-oriented thinking. The company has invested heavily in engineering talent branding and offers a tech-company feel with healthcare stability. [Source: Optum Technology Careers 2025, Levels.fyi Optum vs UHG Comparison]

**Level Mapping:** Optum T3-T4 SWE = Google L3 = Meta E3 = UHG SWE + 15-25% comp premium

**Global Levers**

1. **Optum-Not-UHG Frame:** "I'm joining Optum — the tech arm — not UHG parent. Optum benchmarks 15-25% above UHG for SWE roles. If this offer is in the UHG band, I need it adjusted to the Optum tech band."
2. **Product Revenue Link:** "If I'm working on OptumInsight or OptumRx products, my engineering work directly generates product revenue sold to external clients. This is a product engineering role, not a cost-center IT role, and should be compensated accordingly."
3. **Healthcare Tech Hybrid Value:** "I combine software engineering skills with healthcare domain knowledge. Optum specifically recruits for this hybrid — engineers who can build HIPAA-compliant systems without a 6-month compliance training ramp."
4. **Tech Company Competition:** "Optum competes with Veeva, Tempus, health tech startups, and Big Tech health divisions for talent. My comp should be benchmarked against healthcare tech companies, not traditional healthcare payers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $180K with RSUs at $120K/4yr and a 15% bonus target. I'm specifically choosing Optum for its tech-forward culture, and I expect the comp to reflect Optum's tech band — not the UHG parent band." Optum will counter at $150K-$170K base with $65K-$100K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $210K. Push on base — it's the clearest signal that you're being compensated on the Optum band vs UHG.
