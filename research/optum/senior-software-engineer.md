**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Optum are the technical backbone of UHG's technology transformation. Optum positions itself as a technology company and compensates senior engineers accordingly — 15-25% above UHG parent for equivalent roles. Senior SWEs lead technical design, mentor junior engineers, and own the architecture of platforms serving 150M+ members across OptumRx, OptumInsight, OptumHealth, and Optum Financial. The role combines deep technical expertise with healthcare domain knowledge — senior engineers are expected to make architectural decisions that account for HIPAA compliance, healthcare data standards, and regulatory requirements. Optum's senior engineering culture emphasizes ownership, technical quality, and product thinking. The company has been building a strong IC career ladder to retain senior talent who don't want to move into management. [Source: Optum Engineering Career Framework 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Optum T4-T5 Senior SWE = Google L4 = Meta E4 = UHG Senior SWE + 15-25% comp

**Global Levers**

1. **Optum Premium Confirmation:** "I need to confirm this offer is on Optum's T4-T5 band, not the UHG parent senior engineer band. Optum benchmarks 15-25% above UHG — if the base is below $160K, it's likely on the wrong band."
2. **Product Engineering Scope:** "Senior engineers at Optum don't just maintain internal tools — we build healthcare products sold to external clients. OptumInsight alone generates billions in revenue. My engineering work has direct product revenue attribution."
3. **Cloud Modernization Leadership:** "Optum is in the middle of a massive cloud-native transformation. Senior engineers who can lead this migration — designing microservices, building CI/CD, establishing cloud patterns — command a premium over engineers who maintain existing systems."
4. **RSU Growth Trajectory:** "Optum has been increasing RSU grants for senior engineers as it competes with health tech companies. I'd like the RSU component at $155K/4yr to reflect current market rates, not legacy bands."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $200K with RSUs at $155K/4yr and an 18% bonus target. My senior engineering experience — specifically [cloud architecture / platform design / healthcare systems] at [current company] — makes me immediately productive at Optum's T5 level." Optum will counter at $170K-$190K base with $90K-$130K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $260K. Push RSU and bonus — Optum has more flexibility on these than base.
