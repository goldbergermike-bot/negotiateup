**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Optum manage the cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and platform engineering that support Optum's product portfolio — OptumRx, OptumInsight, OptumHealth, and Optum Financial. Optum runs a multi-cloud environment (primarily Azure and AWS) with strict HIPAA/HITRUST compliance requirements. DevOps at Optum is evolving into Platform Engineering — building internal developer platforms (IDPs) that accelerate delivery for hundreds of engineering teams while maintaining healthcare compliance. The role requires expertise in Kubernetes, Terraform, container orchestration, secrets management, and automated compliance scanning. Optum pays 15-25% more than UHG parent for DevOps roles because Optum's infrastructure directly supports revenue-generating products, not just internal systems. Post-Change Healthcare breach, security-aware DevOps engineers command even higher premiums. [Source: Optum Platform Engineering Strategy 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Optum T3-T4 DevOps = Google L3-L4 SRE = UHG DevOps + 15-25% comp

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Engineering Evolution:** "DevOps at Optum is evolving into Platform Engineering — I'm not just running pipelines, I'm building the internal developer platform that accelerates every engineering team at Optum. This strategic, multiplicative role should be compensated above traditional DevOps bands."
2. **HIPAA Infrastructure Premium:** "Healthcare DevOps requires automated compliance scanning, HIPAA-compliant infrastructure-as-code, and audit-ready deployment pipelines. I bring this regulatory DevOps expertise — which takes years to develop — from day one."
3. **Post-Breach Security Priority:** "After the Change Healthcare incident, Optum's infrastructure security is a board-level priority. DevOps engineers who build secure-by-default infrastructure command a premium because the organizational urgency is unprecedented."
4. **Optum Product Infrastructure:** "Optum's products (OptumRx, OptumInsight) generate billions in revenue. My infrastructure work directly supports product uptime and reliability — downtime means lost revenue and damaged client relationships."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $185K with RSUs at $130K/4yr and a 15% bonus target. My experience building HIPAA-compliant infrastructure and internal developer platforms at [current company] maps directly to Optum's platform engineering needs." Optum will counter at $155K-$170K base with $70K-$100K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $220K. Push on base — healthcare DevOps expertise is the strongest base lever.
