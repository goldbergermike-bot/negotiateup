### Product Manager | Optum Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** UHG Tech/Analytics Subsidiary / Higher Comp Than Parent / Product-Led Organization

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Eden Prairie MN | $145K–$200K | $65K–$165K/4yr | 12–20% | $195K–$305K |
| Dallas TX | $140K–$195K | $60K–$155K/4yr | 12–20% | $190K–$295K |
| Remote US | $135K–$185K | $55K–$145K/4yr | 12–20% | $180K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Optum own the strategy, roadmap, and delivery of healthcare technology products that generate direct revenue. Unlike UHG parent PMs (who often manage internal tools), Optum PMs build products sold to external healthcare clients — OptumInsight analytics platforms, OptumRx pharmacy management solutions, OptumHealth clinical tools, and Optum Financial payment systems. This product-revenue context gives Optum PMs meaningful leverage: your roadmap decisions directly impact ARR, customer acquisition, and retention. Optum PMs earn 15-20% more than UHG parent PMs and have higher bonus targets. The role requires combining product strategy skills with healthcare domain expertise — understanding clinical workflows, payer operations, pharmacy benefit management, and healthcare regulatory constraints. Optum competes with Veeva, Tempus, health tech startups, and Big Tech health divisions for healthcare product talent. [Source: Optum Product Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Optum T4-T5 PM = Google L4-L5 PM = Meta IC4-IC5 PM = UHG PM + 15-20% comp

**Global Levers**

1. **Product Revenue Ownership:** "I'm owning the roadmap for products that generate direct revenue. My prioritization decisions — what to build, when to ship — directly impact Optum's product ARR. This revenue ownership should be reflected in both RSU and bonus."
2. **Healthcare Product Domain:** "Healthcare product management requires understanding clinical workflows, regulatory constraints, and payer/provider dynamics. PMs without this expertise take 12-18 months to become effective. My healthcare domain experience has immediate value."
3. **Optum PM Premium:** "Optum PMs are benchmarked 15-20% above UHG parent PMs. I need the offer to clearly reflect the Optum product management band."
4. **Bonus Target Push:** "Optum PMs have bonus targets of 12-20%. Given the revenue scope of the product I'll own, I'm targeting 20% — aligned with PMs managing major product lines."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the base at $195K with RSUs at $145K/4yr and a 20% bonus target. My healthcare product management experience — launching [specific product/feature] that generated [revenue/adoption metric] at [current company] — directly maps to Optum's product portfolio." Optum will counter at $165K-$185K base with $80K-$120K RSUs. Accept if total comp exceeds $250K. Push hardest on bonus target — PMs at Optum have strong bonus leverage.
