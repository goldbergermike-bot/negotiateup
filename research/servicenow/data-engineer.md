**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced (Base + Equity + Bonus) | $10B→$15B Revenue Sprint | AI Control Tower Platform

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (ServiceNow RSUs — NYSE: NOW, 4yr vest) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara (USD) | $170K–$218K | $175K–$315K | 10–15% | $218K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at ServiceNow build the data infrastructure that powers both internal analytics and the Now Platform's intelligence features. ServiceNow processes billions of workflow events daily — each one is a data point that feeds predictive analytics, AI agent intelligence, and customer usage insights. ServiceNow is positioning itself as the enterprise "AI Control Tower," the central orchestration layer for AI agents across the enterprise, and the data platform is the foundation that makes AI agents intelligent. The core 2026 skill is AI Agent Innovation, and data engineers who build the pipelines that feed AI agent models are critical to the strategy. ServiceNow's multi-instance architecture (each customer gets their own instance) creates unique data engineering challenges. DE comp includes all three levers (base + ServiceNow RSUs — NYSE: NOW + bonus at 10-15%).

### 🏗️ ServiceNow AI Control Tower & AI Agent Innovation Lever

On **Jan 20, 2026**, ServiceNow launched its reimagined **Build Program**, transitioning **1,000+ partners** to the AI Platform. ServiceNow is positioning itself as the enterprise **AI Control Tower** — the central orchestration layer for AI agents across the enterprise. The core 2026 skill is **AI Agent Innovation**: building the data pipelines and infrastructure that power autonomous agent intelligence.

As a Data Engineer, you build the data foundation that makes the AI Control Tower intelligent. The Build Program's transition of 1,000+ partners means data pipelines must support not just ServiceNow's internal AI agent models, but partner-built agents that need access to workflow data for training and inference. Your pipelines determine the quality, freshness, and reliability of data that AI agents use to make autonomous decisions in Fortune 500 environments.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Agent Data Foundation:** "ServiceNow launched its reimagined Build Program on January 20, 2026, transitioning 1,000+ partners to the AI Platform. As a Data Engineer, I build the data pipelines that power the AI Control Tower's intelligence — without reliable data infrastructure, AI Agent Innovation is impossible."
2. **Multi-Instance Data Complexity:** "ServiceNow's multi-instance architecture creates data engineering challenges that multi-tenant companies don't face. Unifying data across thousands of customer instances for AI agent training requires specialized expertise."
3. **Workflow Data Scale:** "ServiceNow processes billions of workflow events daily from the Fortune 500. I'm building the pipelines that turn this data into AI agent intelligence. The scale is comparable to any hyperscaler's data infrastructure."
4. **Competing DE Offers:** Snowflake, Databricks, and Datadog are direct competitors for data engineering talent. Use competing offers aggressively: "I have competing offers from Snowflake and Databricks where data engineering is the core product."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $300K total comp. I'd like the RSU grant at 640 NOW RSUs over 4 years (approximately $295K at current price), with a 15% bonus and $30K sign-on. My experience building data pipelines at [hyperscale environment] maps directly to ServiceNow's AI Control Tower data infrastructure needs. I'm also in process with Snowflake and Databricks with competitive equity packages." ServiceNow will counter at $230K–$270K in NOW RSUs with a $20K sign-on — accept at $250K+ NOW RSUs if the bonus is confirmed at 15% and sign-on is $20K+.
