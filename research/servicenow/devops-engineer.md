### DevOps Engineer | ServiceNow Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced (Base + Equity + Bonus) | $10B→$15B Revenue Sprint | AI Control Tower Platform

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (ServiceNow RSUs — NYSE: NOW, 4yr vest) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara (USD) | $165K–$210K | $150K–$280K | 10–15% | $205K–$278K |
| San Diego (USD) | $155K–$195K | $135K–$250K | 10–15% | $190K–$255K |
| London (GBP £) | £108K–£137K | £98K–£182K | 10–15% | £133K–£181K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at ServiceNow maintain the infrastructure that powers 99.99% uptime for 85% of the Fortune 500. ServiceNow is positioning itself as the enterprise "AI Control Tower" — the central orchestration layer for AI agents across the enterprise — and the infrastructure must support AI agent workloads at enterprise scale. The irony is powerful: ServiceNow sells IT automation, and its own platform must be the gold standard for reliability. ServiceNow's multi-instance architecture (not multi-tenant like Salesforce) creates unique infrastructure challenges. The core 2026 skill is AI Agent Innovation, and DevOps engineers who can deploy, monitor, and scale AI agent infrastructure are critical to the AI Control Tower strategy. DevOps comp includes all three levers (base + ServiceNow RSUs — NYSE: NOW + bonus at 10-15%).

### 🏗️ ServiceNow AI Control Tower & AI Agent Innovation Lever

On **Jan 20, 2026**, ServiceNow launched its reimagined **Build Program**, transitioning **1,000+ partners** to the AI Platform. ServiceNow is positioning itself as the enterprise **AI Control Tower** — the central orchestration layer for AI agents across the enterprise. The core 2026 skill is **AI Agent Innovation**: building and scaling the infrastructure that supports autonomous agents at enterprise-grade reliability.

As a DevOps Engineer, you ensure the AI Control Tower's infrastructure meets the 99.99% uptime SLA that Fortune 500 customers demand — now with AI agent workloads that have fundamentally different scaling and latency characteristics. The Build Program's transition of 1,000+ partners means AI agent infrastructure must scale to support an entire ecosystem, not just internal teams. DevOps engineers who can bridge traditional enterprise reliability with AI agent infrastructure demands are scarce.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Infrastructure Reliability:** "ServiceNow launched its reimagined Build Program on January 20, 2026, transitioning 1,000+ partners to the AI Platform. As a DevOps Engineer, I ensure the AI Control Tower infrastructure scales to support 1,000+ partners and Fortune 500 customers with 99.99% uptime — AI Agent Innovation requires infrastructure that doesn't exist yet."
2. **Uptime Revenue Impact:** "Every minute of downtime costs ServiceNow's Fortune 500 customers millions. My work maintaining 99.99% uptime directly protects ServiceNow's $15B revenue base. This operational impact justifies top-of-band compensation."
3. **AI Workload Expertise:** "AI agent workloads have fundamentally different infrastructure requirements — GPU scheduling, model serving, real-time inference latency. My DevOps expertise in AI infrastructure is a premium skill."
4. **Competing Infrastructure Offers:** AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure all compete aggressively for DevOps/SRE talent. A competing cloud offer creates strong dynamics: "I have an offer from [cloud provider] with significant equity upside."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $278K total comp. I'd like the RSU grant at 580 NOW RSUs over 4 years (approximately $265K at current price), with a sign-on bonus of $30K. I'm also in process with AWS and Google Cloud, where infrastructure comp packages are highly competitive. My experience scaling AI workloads at enterprise reliability directly supports ServiceNow's AI Control Tower infrastructure." ServiceNow will counter at $200K–$240K in NOW RSUs with a $20K sign-on — accept at $220K+ NOW RSUs if the bonus is confirmed at 15% and sign-on is $20K+.
