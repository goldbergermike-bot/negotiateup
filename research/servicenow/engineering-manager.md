### Engineering Manager | ServiceNow Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced (Base + Equity + Bonus) | $10B→$15B Revenue Sprint | AI Control Tower Platform

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (ServiceNow RSUs — NYSE: NOW, 4yr vest) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara (USD) | $215K–$265K | $280K–$460K | 15–20% | $315K–$400K |
| San Diego (USD) | $195K–$245K | $250K–$400K | 15–20% | $285K–$363K |

**Negotiation DNA**

EMs at ServiceNow lead teams building one of the most reliable enterprise platforms in the world — and ServiceNow is positioning itself as the enterprise "AI Control Tower," the central orchestration layer for AI agents across the enterprise. ServiceNow's disciplined headcount growth (~10% annually vs. 20%+ revenue growth) means each EM manages a lean team with high output expectations. The core 2026 skill for engineering leadership is AI Agent Innovation: EMs must build and scale teams that deliver autonomous AI agent capabilities on the Now Platform. EM comp includes all three levers (base + ServiceNow RSUs — NYSE: NOW + bonus), with the bonus typically at 15-20% target.

### 🏗️ ServiceNow AI Control Tower & AI Agent Innovation Lever

On **Jan 20, 2026**, ServiceNow launched its reimagined **Build Program**, transitioning **1,000+ partners** to the AI Platform. ServiceNow is positioning itself as the enterprise **AI Control Tower** — the central orchestration layer for AI agents across the enterprise. The core 2026 skill is **AI Agent Innovation**: leading teams that build and deploy autonomous agents at enterprise scale.

As an Engineering Manager, you are responsible for building and leading the teams that deliver the AI Control Tower strategy. The Build Program's transition of 1,000+ partners creates urgent demand for EMs who can scale AI agent development teams, manage cross-functional integration, and ship AI agent features at the pace ServiceNow's $15B revenue target demands. Frame your negotiation around your ability to build high-performing AI-focused teams that execute on AI Agent Innovation.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Agent Team Leadership:** "ServiceNow launched its reimagined Build Program on January 20, 2026, transitioning 1,000+ partners to the AI Platform. I'm leading the teams that build the AI Control Tower's agent capabilities — this is the highest-priority engineering work at ServiceNow. My expertise in scaling AI Agent Innovation teams justifies top-of-band compensation."
2. **Efficiency Narrative:** "ServiceNow grows revenue 20%+ while growing headcount only 10%. That means every manager is expected to deliver 2x the output per engineer. My management expertise in high-efficiency environments justifies the premium."
3. **IC Parity Check:** Ensure your EM total comp exceeds your highest-paid direct report. If it doesn't, use this as leverage: "I need the package to at least match the Staff ICs on my team who are building AI agent features."
4. **Sign-On Emphasis:** ServiceNow is generous with sign-on bonuses for EMs ($30K–$60K). Always negotiate for sign-on to bridge the 1-year RSU cliff.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $400K total comp, with 900 NOW RSUs over 4 years (approximately $420K at current price), bonus at 20%, and a $50K sign-on. I'm bringing management experience building AI agent teams at [company], and I expect comp reflecting ServiceNow's AI Control Tower ambitions and the $15B revenue target." ServiceNow will counter at $360K–$400K in NOW RSUs — accept at $360K+ RSUs if bonus is confirmed at 20% and sign-on is $40K+.
