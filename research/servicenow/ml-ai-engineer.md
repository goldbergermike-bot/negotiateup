### ML/AI Engineer | ServiceNow Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced (Base + Equity + Bonus) | $10B→$15B Revenue Sprint | AI Control Tower Platform | **+15–25% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (ServiceNow RSUs — NYSE: NOW, 4yr vest) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara (USD) | $195K–$255K | $270K–$450K | 10–15% | $275K–$380K |
| San Diego (USD) | $180K–$238K | $240K–$400K | 10–15% | $253K–$348K |
| London (GBP £) | £127K–£166K | £176K–£293K | 10–15% | £179K–£248K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at ServiceNow are building the intelligence core of the enterprise "AI Control Tower" — the central orchestration layer for AI agents across the enterprise. ServiceNow's AI agents autonomously resolve IT tickets, answer HR questions, triage customer service issues, and execute multi-step workflows — and ML/AI Engineers build the models, inference pipelines, and agent orchestration logic that makes this possible. The core 2026 skill is AI Agent Innovation: building autonomous agents that operate reliably in Fortune 500 production environments. ML/AI roles command the 15-25% Agentic AI premium because autonomous agent development is fundamentally more complex than standard ML inference. Comp includes all three levers (base + ServiceNow RSUs — NYSE: NOW + bonus at 10-15%), and the compound effect of ServiceNow's proprietary workflow data + LLM capabilities + agent orchestration creates a differentiated AI product that competitors cannot easily replicate.

**Level Mapping:** ServiceNow Senior ML Eng = Google L4 ML = Meta ML Engineer (E4) = Salesforce Senior ML Eng

### 🏗️ ServiceNow AI Control Tower & AI Agent Innovation Lever

On **Jan 20, 2026**, ServiceNow launched its reimagined **Build Program**, transitioning **1,000+ partners** to the AI Platform. ServiceNow is positioning itself as the enterprise **AI Control Tower** — the central orchestration layer for AI agents across the enterprise. The core 2026 skill is **AI Agent Innovation**: building the ML models, agent orchestration systems, and inference pipelines that power autonomous enterprise agents.

As an ML/AI Engineer, you are building the brain of the AI Control Tower. The Build Program's transition of 1,000+ partners means your AI agent models must generalize across diverse enterprise environments, partner-built applications, and customer-specific workflows. The quality of your models directly determines whether AI agents can autonomously resolve incidents, execute workflows, and make decisions that Fortune 500 companies trust. ML/AI Engineers who can build production-grade autonomous agents are the most strategically valuable hires in ServiceNow's $15B sprint.

**Global Levers**

1. **Agentic AI Premium (15-25%):** "ServiceNow launched its reimagined Build Program on January 20, 2026, transitioning 1,000+ partners to the AI Platform. I'm building the autonomous AI agents that power the AI Control Tower — AI Agent Innovation at this scale is not standard ML engineering. Autonomous agents that resolve tickets and execute workflows require a 15-25% premium."
2. **Proprietary Data + Agent Intelligence:** "ServiceNow's enterprise workflow dataset — billions of IT, HR, and customer service interactions from the Fortune 500 — combined with autonomous agent capabilities creates a moat that no competitor can replicate. I'm building at the intersection of this data advantage and AI agent architecture."
3. **AI Control Tower Model Quality:** "My models determine whether AI agents make correct autonomous decisions in Fortune 500 production environments. Model quality directly impacts customer trust, adoption, and ServiceNow's $15B revenue target."
4. **AI-Native Counter-Offers:** Competing offers from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Cohere create maximum urgency. Even indicating parallel AI-native company processes will push ServiceNow's equity significantly higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $380K total comp with the Agentic AI premium applied. I'd like the RSU grant at 900 NOW RSUs over 4 years (approximately $415K at current price), with a sign-on bonus of $45K. The Agentic AI premium should be reflected in both base and equity — building autonomous agents for the AI Control Tower is fundamentally different from standard ML inference. I have competing interest from [AI-native company] where the equity component is $500K+." ServiceNow will counter at $360K–$400K in NOW RSUs — accept at $370K+ NOW RSUs if the Agentic AI premium is applied and bonus is confirmed at 15%.
