**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at ServiceNow protect the platform that runs IT security operations for 85% of the Fortune 500. ServiceNow SecOps is its own product line — meaning you may be building the security tooling AND securing the platform simultaneously. ServiceNow is positioning itself as the enterprise "AI Control Tower," the central orchestration layer for AI agents across the enterprise, and AI agents introduce entirely new attack surfaces: LLM prompt injection, agent permission escalation, autonomous action safety, and AI-generated content risks. The core 2026 skill is AI Agent Innovation, and security engineers who can secure autonomous AI agents command a 10-20% premium. Security comp includes all three levers (base + ServiceNow RSUs — NYSE: NOW + bonus at 10-15%). ServiceNow's compliance burden (FedRAMP, SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA) is extensive.

### 🏗️ ServiceNow AI Control Tower & AI Agent Innovation Lever

On **Jan 20, 2026**, ServiceNow launched its reimagined **Build Program**, transitioning **1,000+ partners** to the AI Platform. ServiceNow is positioning itself as the enterprise **AI Control Tower** — the central orchestration layer for AI agents across the enterprise. The core 2026 skill is **AI Agent Innovation**: securing autonomous agents that operate in Fortune 500 production environments.

As a Security Engineer, you ensure the AI Control Tower is trustworthy. The Build Program's transition of 1,000+ partners means the AI agent security model must be robust enough for an entire ecosystem — partner-built agents, customer-deployed workflows, and autonomous actions all need security guardrails. AI agents that autonomously resolve tickets, modify configurations, and execute workflows create novel security challenges that traditional security frameworks don't address.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Agent Security Pioneer:** "ServiceNow launched its reimagined Build Program on January 20, 2026, transitioning 1,000+ partners to the AI Platform. Securing the AI Control Tower's autonomous agents is a new security discipline — I bring the expertise to build security guardrails for AI Agent Innovation that protect Fortune 500 production environments."
2. **SecOps Product + Platform Dual Mandate:** "I'm unique at ServiceNow because I may be building the SecOps product AND securing the AI Control Tower platform. This dual mandate justifies above-band comp."
3. **AI Security Premium (10-20%):** "Autonomous AI agents introduce novel attack vectors — prompt injection, permission escalation, autonomous action safety. Securing AI agents is not standard security engineering. I expect the 10-20% AI security premium applied to my package."
4. **Cybersecurity Talent War:** Use CrowdStrike, Zscaler, and Okta offers as competing leverage. All include bonuses; CrowdStrike typically pays the highest total comp in cybersecurity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $340K total comp with the AI security premium. I'd like the RSU grant at 750 NOW RSUs over 4 years (approximately $345K at current price), with a 15% bonus and $35K sign-on. My AI security expertise applies directly to securing ServiceNow's AI Control Tower and the autonomous agents running in Fortune 500 environments. I have competing offers from CrowdStrike and [cybersecurity company] with higher total comp." ServiceNow will counter at $290K–$330K in NOW RSUs with a $25K sign-on — accept at $300K+ NOW RSUs if the AI security premium is applied and bonus is confirmed at 15%.
