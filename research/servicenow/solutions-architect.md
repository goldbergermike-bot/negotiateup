### Solutions Architect | ServiceNow Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced (Base + Equity + Bonus) | $10B→$15B Revenue Sprint | AI Control Tower Platform

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (ServiceNow RSUs — NYSE: NOW, 4yr vest) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara (USD) | $185K–$230K | $190K–$340K | 15% | $240K–$325K |
| San Diego (USD) | $170K–$215K | $170K–$300K | 15% | $220K–$298K |
| London (GBP £) | £120K–£150K | £124K–£221K | 15% | £156K–£212K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at ServiceNow are the bridge between the Now Platform's capabilities and Fortune 500 customer architectures. ServiceNow is positioning itself as the enterprise "AI Control Tower" — the central orchestration layer for AI agents across the enterprise — and SAs are evolving from "configure workflows" to "architect AI agent deployments that automate enterprise operations." The core 2026 skill is AI Agent Innovation: designing AI agent architectures that integrate with customer IT, HR, and customer service stacks. ServiceNow SAs are trusted advisors to CIOs and CTOs — the role carries significant customer-facing prestige and travel expectations. SA comp includes all three levers (base + ServiceNow RSUs — NYSE: NOW + bonus at 15%), and equity grants reflect the revenue influence SAs have on deal expansion.

### 🏗️ ServiceNow AI Control Tower & AI Agent Innovation Lever

On **Jan 20, 2026**, ServiceNow launched its reimagined **Build Program**, transitioning **1,000+ partners** to the AI Platform. ServiceNow is positioning itself as the enterprise **AI Control Tower** — the central orchestration layer for AI agents across the enterprise. The core 2026 skill is **AI Agent Innovation**: architecting AI agent deployments that solve real enterprise problems at customer sites.

As a Solutions Architect, you are the front line of AI Control Tower adoption. The Build Program's transition of 1,000+ partners means you are now designing AI agent architectures not just for direct customers but for an entire partner ecosystem. SAs who can translate AI Agent Innovation into customer-specific architectures — and drive expansion from 3 products to 8+ — are the most revenue-influential hires at ServiceNow.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Agent Deployment Architect:** "ServiceNow launched its reimagined Build Program on January 20, 2026, transitioning 1,000+ partners to the AI Platform. As a Solutions Architect, I design the AI Control Tower deployments that drive AI Agent Innovation adoption at Fortune 500 customers and across the partner ecosystem."
2. **Deal Expansion Influence:** "My architecture recommendations directly influence customer expansion from 3 products to 8+ products. Each product adoption represents millions in incremental ARR. My comp should reflect this revenue influence."
3. **Certification Value:** ServiceNow Certified Master Architect (CMA) is one of the most prestigious enterprise certifications. If you hold CMA, push for 15-20% above standard SA comp.
4. **Travel Compensation:** If the role requires 40-60% travel, negotiate a travel premium or higher sign-on ($35K–$50K) to offset quality-of-life impact.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $325K total comp. I'd like the RSU grant at 700 NOW RSUs over 4 years (approximately $320K at current price), with a 15% bonus and $40K sign-on. My enterprise architecture background and AI agent deployment experience justify top-of-band placement. I'm also in process with AWS and Google Cloud for senior SA roles with significant equity packages." ServiceNow will counter at $260K–$300K in NOW RSUs with a $25K–$30K sign-on — accept at $280K+ NOW RSUs if the bonus is confirmed at 15% and sign-on is $30K+.
