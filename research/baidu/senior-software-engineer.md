**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Baidu (T6-T7) lead critical technical initiatives across search, AI, and autonomous driving. At the US offices, seniors architect search infrastructure, build ERNIE model serving systems, and develop Apollo's core autonomy stack. Compensation at the senior level has improved as Baidu competes with FAANG and Chinese tech giants (ByteDance, Tencent, Alibaba) for experienced engineers.

Baidu's senior engineers in Beijing are among the most respected in Chinese tech, with T7 engineers wielding significant architectural authority. The company's investment in AI (ERNIE has become a leading Chinese LLM) and AV (Apollo's commercial success) makes senior roles at Baidu more strategically interesting than the $40B market cap might suggest.

**Level Mapping:** Senior SWE at Baidu (T6-T7) = L5 at Google, IC5 at Meta, SDE III at Amazon

**The ERNIE + Apollo Premium**

Baidu's dual bet on large language models (ERNIE) and autonomous driving (Apollo) means senior engineers can work at the frontier of two of the most important AI applications. This combination is unique and creates strong career optionality.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG Senior Offer:** "I have an L5 offer from [Google/Meta] at $[X] TC. Baidu's AI and AV challenges are comparable in technical depth."
2. **AI/AV Expertise:** "My [LLM/autonomous driving/deep learning] experience directly advances Baidu's highest-priority initiatives."
3. **Search Infrastructure:** "My search infrastructure experience at scale applies directly to Baidu's core product serving 600M+ users."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[40K-60K] sign-on offsets my unvested equity and the comp gap with FAANG."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and 15% bonus. Baidu's ERNIE and Apollo initiatives are at the frontier of AI. I have a competing L5 offer from Google at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+60K] and a $50K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
