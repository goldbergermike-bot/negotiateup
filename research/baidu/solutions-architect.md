Compensation includes base, RSUs, and in some cases partnership-influenced bonuses.

**The AI Enterprise Premium**

Baidu's AI products (ERNIE API, PaddlePaddle, AI Cloud) are in early enterprise adoption stages. SAs who can drive enterprise AI adoption are critical to Baidu's revenue diversification.

2. **AI Platform Expertise:** "My [AI platform/LLM API/enterprise AI] experience accelerates Baidu's commercial AI deployment."
3. **Partner Relationships:** "My relationships with [auto manufacturers/enterprises] drive Apollo and ERNIE adoption."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[30K-45K] sign-on offsets transition costs."
