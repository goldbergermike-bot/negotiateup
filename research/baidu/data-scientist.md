### Data Scientist | Baidu Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $40B market cap with China's largest search behavioral dataset + Apollo AV safety analytics + ERNIE model evaluation + US R&D comp competitive for analytics talent | Baidu data scientists analyze search, AI, and autonomous driving at scale | **AI ANALYTICS PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Bay Area / Sunnyvale (US R&D) | $155K–$215K | $60K–$170K | 15% | $200K–$320K |
| Seattle (US) | $150K–$210K | $55K–$165K | 15% | $195K–$310K |
| Beijing (HQ) | CNY 420K–CNY 750K | CNY 150K–CNY 430K | 15–25% | CNY 610K–CNY 1.2M |
| Shanghai | CNY 400K–CNY 720K | CNY 140K–CNY 410K | 15–25% | CNY 580K–CNY 1.15M |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Baidu analyze user behavior from China's largest search engine (600M+ MAU), evaluate AI model performance (ERNIE benchmarking and optimization), and develop safety analytics for Apollo's autonomous driving fleet. The combination of search analytics, LLM evaluation, and AV safety science creates uniquely versatile data science opportunities.

US-based data scientists focus on Apollo safety metrics, ERNIE model evaluation, and search optimization. Compensation is competitive with mid-tier tech data science roles.

**Level Mapping:** Data Scientist at Baidu (T5-T7) = L4-L5 at Google, IC4-IC5 at Meta, DS Senior at Amazon

**The AV Safety Analytics Premium**

Apollo's commercial deployment requires rigorous safety analytics -- measuring disengagement rates, edge case identification, and safety improvement trends. Data scientists with AV safety analysis experience are extremely scarce and command premium compensation.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG DS Offer:** "I have a DS offer from [Google/Meta] at $[X] TC. Baidu's AI and AV analytics are compelling."
2. **AV Safety Expertise:** "My [safety analytics/autonomous systems/statistical testing] experience directly enables Apollo's commercial scaling."
3. **LLM Evaluation:** "My model evaluation and benchmarking expertise accelerates ERNIE's development cycle."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[30K-45K] sign-on offsets my unvested equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and 15% bonus. Baidu's AI and AV analytics challenges are unique. I have a competing offer from [Google/Meta] DS at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+45K] and a $35K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
