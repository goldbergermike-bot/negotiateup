**Negotiation DNA**

Baidu Apollo is the world's most deployed autonomous driving platform. With over 5 million cumulative autonomous rides delivered through its robotaxi service (Apollo Go) in Chinese cities, Apollo has surpassed Waymo in total ride volume and operates the world's largest fleet of Level 4 autonomous vehicles. Apollo engineers build perception systems (LiDAR, camera, radar fusion), planning and control algorithms, simulation environments, HD mapping, and the vehicle-to-cloud infrastructure that enables safe autonomous driving at scale.

Baidu's US R&D offices in Sunnyvale focus on Apollo's core perception and planning algorithms, AI/ML infrastructure, and simulation technology. Compensation for US-based AV engineers is competitive with Waymo, Cruise, and Aurora, though typically 10-15% below Waymo at the senior level. Baidu compensates for this gap with larger equity grants and the opportunity to work on the world's most commercially deployed AV system.

In China, Apollo engineers are among Baidu's highest-paid employees, reflecting the strategic importance of autonomous driving to the company's future. Performance bonuses can reach 30% for engineers contributing to Apollo's commercial milestones (new city deployments, safety metrics, regulatory approvals).

**Level Mapping:** Apollo Autonomous Engineer at Baidu (T5-T7) = L4-L6 at Waymo, equivalent Aurora/Cruise senior roles, L5-L6 at Google

**The Commercial Deployment Premium**

Apollo's advantage over Western AV competitors is commercial deployment scale: while Waymo operates in a handful of US cities, Apollo Go operates in dozens of Chinese cities with millions of rides completed. Engineers who have experience deploying AV technology at this commercial scale possess expertise that is extraordinarily valuable as the entire industry moves toward commercialization.

Baidu's open-source Apollo platform (the "Android of autonomous driving") is used by over 200 partners globally, creating an ecosystem that multiplies the impact of Apollo engineering work. The platform's adoption provides Baidu with data advantages that compound over time, making each engineer's contribution increasingly valuable.

**Global Levers**

1. **AV Company Offer:** "I have an offer from [Waymo/Aurora/Cruise] at $[X] TC. Apollo's commercial deployment scale exceeds any Western competitor, and I'd like compensation reflecting the strategic importance of this work."
2. **Perception/Planning Expertise:** "My [LiDAR perception/motion planning/prediction/simulation] expertise directly advances Apollo's L4 capabilities. This skillset commands $[X] at Waymo."
3. **Commercial Scale Value:** "Apollo has more commercial AV rides than any competitor globally. My experience scaling AV systems from prototype to production is exactly what Apollo needs."
4. **Safety-Critical Systems:** "My experience with [safety-critical software/functional safety/SOTIF] enables Apollo's expansion to new cities and regulatory environments."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and 15% bonus. Apollo's commercial deployment scale is unmatched globally -- 5M+ rides delivered. I have a competing offer from Waymo at $[W]K TC. To choose Baidu, I need RSUs increased to $[Y+70K] and a $50K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]. Apollo's market position makes this investment in AV talent highly justified."
