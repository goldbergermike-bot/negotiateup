### Security Engineer | Baidu Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $40B market cap with search security for 600M+ users + Apollo AV safety-critical security + ERNIE AI safety and alignment + Competitive US security comp | Baidu security engineers protect AI and AV systems where security failures have physical consequences | **SAFETY-CRITICAL SECURITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Bay Area / Sunnyvale (US R&D) | $155K–$215K | $60K–$175K | 15% | $205K–$325K |
| Seattle (US) | $150K–$210K | $55K–$170K | 15% | $200K–$315K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Baidu protect systems where security failures can have physical consequences. Apollo's autonomous vehicles must be secured against cyberattacks that could compromise passenger safety -- vehicle-to-cloud communication, OTA software updates, and sensor data integrity are all attack vectors. ERNIE's AI safety (preventing prompt injection, ensuring alignment, protecting user data) is critical for commercial deployment. Baidu Search security protects 600M+ users from malware, phishing, and privacy threats.

US-based security engineers focus on Apollo vehicle cybersecurity, AI safety/alignment for ERNIE, and cloud security. Compensation reflects the specialized nature of AV and AI security.

**The AV Cybersecurity Premium**

Autonomous vehicle cybersecurity is a frontier discipline where security failures can cause physical harm. Engineers with AV security expertise (vehicle network security, OTA integrity, V2X communication security) are extraordinarily scarce.

**Global Levers**

1. **AV/Security Offer:** "I have an offer from [Waymo Security/CrowdStrike/Google Security] at $[X] TC. Baidu's AV security challenges are unique."
2. **AV Cybersecurity:** "My [vehicle cybersecurity/OTA security/V2X] expertise directly enables Apollo's safe commercial deployment."
3. **AI Safety:** "My [AI alignment/prompt security/model safety] expertise is critical for ERNIE's commercial deployment."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[35K-50K] sign-on reflects the AV/AI security talent shortage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and 15% bonus. AV cybersecurity at Apollo's scale is a frontier challenge. I have a competing offer from [Waymo Security/CrowdStrike] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+50K] and a $40K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
