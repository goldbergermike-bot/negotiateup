|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Baidu define strategy for the company's AI product portfolio: Apollo Go (robotaxi commercial service), ERNIE (LLM platform and API), Baidu Search, and Baidu AI Cloud. US-based PMs focus on Apollo's commercial strategy and AI product development. Baidu's PM function has grown as the company transitions from a search company to an AI platform company.

Compensation is competitive with mid-tier tech PM roles, with RSU grants and performance bonuses.

**Level Mapping:** Product Manager at Baidu (T6-T7) = L5-L6 PM at Google, IC5-IC6 PM at Meta, Sr PM at Amazon

**The AI Product-Market Fit Premium**

Baidu's AI products (ERNIE, Apollo) are in early commercialization stages. PMs who can define product-market fit, pricing, and go-to-market strategy for AI products are scarce and highly valued.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG PM Offer:** "I have a PM offer from [Google/Meta] at $[X] TC. Baidu's AI commercialization challenges are unique."
2. **AV Product Expertise:** "My [mobility/robotaxi/autonomous driving product] experience accelerates Apollo Go's commercial growth."
3. **AI Platform Strategy:** "My experience with AI platform products (APIs, developer tools) directly applies to ERNIE's commercialization."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[35K-50K] sign-on offsets transition risk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and 15% bonus. Defining product strategy for Apollo and ERNIE is a rare opportunity. I have a competing PM offer from [Google/Meta] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+50K] and a $40K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
