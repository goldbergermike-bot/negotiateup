**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Baidu manage infrastructure supporting search (600M+ MAU, billions of daily queries), Apollo AV (cloud infrastructure for fleet management, simulation, and map updates), and Baidu AI Cloud. The company's infrastructure must handle search traffic spikes, real-time AV data processing, and AI model training workloads -- each with different reliability and latency requirements.

US-based DevOps engineers focus on Apollo's cloud infrastructure, CI/CD for AV software deployment, and AI training cluster management. Compensation is competitive with mid-tier tech SRE roles.

**Level Mapping:** DevOps Engineer at Baidu (T4-T6) = L3-L5 SRE at Google, IC3-IC5 PE at Meta, SysDE at Amazon

**The AV Infrastructure Premium**

Apollo's infrastructure requirements are uniquely demanding: real-time data upload from vehicles, over-the-air software updates to autonomous fleets, massive simulation environments, and HD map serving -- all requiring near-zero downtime for safety-critical systems.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cloud/SRE Offer:** "I have an SRE offer from [Google/Amazon] at $[X] TC. Baidu's infrastructure spans search, AV, and AI."
2. **AV Infrastructure:** "My [fleet management/OTA deployment/safety-critical systems] experience enables Apollo's commercial scaling."
3. **AI Training Infrastructure:** "My GPU cluster management and AI infrastructure experience accelerates ERNIE's development."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[30K-45K] sign-on offsets transition costs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and 15% bonus. Baidu's infrastructure spanning search, AV, and AI is uniquely challenging. I have a competing offer from [Google SRE/Amazon] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+45K] and a $35K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
