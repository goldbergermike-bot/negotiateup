**Negotiation DNA**

Baidu is China's AI pioneer, having invested in deep learning before any other major Chinese tech company. ML/AI Engineers at Baidu work across the full spectrum of applied AI: ERNIE (one of China's leading LLMs, with billions of API calls daily), Apollo perception (LiDAR/camera fusion, prediction, planning), PaddlePaddle (Baidu's open-source deep learning framework, used by 8M+ developers), and search AI (query understanding, ranking, knowledge graph).

US-based AI engineers focus on Apollo's perception and prediction stack, ERNIE model development, and PaddlePaddle framework engineering. Compensation for AI talent at Baidu has increased significantly as the company competes with ByteDance, Tencent, and international AI labs for top researchers and engineers.

**Level Mapping:** ML/AI Engineer at Baidu (T5-T7) = L4-L6 at Google Brain, IC4-IC6 at Meta FAIR, Research Engineer at OpenAI/Anthropic

**The Full-Stack AI Premium**

Baidu offers AI engineers the opportunity to work across NLP (ERNIE), computer vision (Apollo perception), reinforcement learning (Apollo planning), and framework engineering (PaddlePaddle) -- a breadth of AI domains that few companies can match. This full-stack AI experience is highly valued in the market.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Lab Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google Brain/OpenAI/Anthropic] at $[X] TC. Baidu's AI breadth -- LLM, AV, and framework -- is unique."
2. **AV Perception Expertise:** "My [LiDAR perception/sensor fusion/motion prediction] expertise directly advances Apollo's autonomy capabilities."
3. **LLM Development:** "My [LLM training/RLHF/model optimization] experience accelerates ERNIE's development."
4. **Publication Record:** "My research publications demonstrate expertise that enhances Baidu's AI credibility."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and 15% bonus. Baidu's AI breadth -- ERNIE, Apollo, PaddlePaddle -- is unique in the industry. I have a competing offer from [Google Brain/OpenAI] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+60K] and a $50K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
