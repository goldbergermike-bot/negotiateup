**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Baidu manage programs spanning Apollo's autonomous vehicle deployments (new city launches, regulatory approvals, safety certification), ERNIE model releases, and search infrastructure upgrades. Apollo deployment programs are uniquely high-stakes: launching a robotaxi service in a new city involves coordinating engineering, safety validation, regulatory approval, operations, and fleet management across US and Chinese teams.

US-based TPMs focus on Apollo's technology programs, cross-border engineering coordination, and AI product launches. Compensation is competitive with mid-tier tech TPM roles.

**Level Mapping:** TPM at Baidu (T6-T7) = L5-L6 TPM at Google, IC5-IC6 TPM at Meta, Sr TPM at Amazon

**The AV Deployment Program Premium**

Apollo city deployment programs are among the most complex TPM assignments in tech: they involve hardware (vehicle fleet), software (autonomy stack), regulatory (government approvals), and operational (ride-hailing service) coordination simultaneously. TPMs with experience managing safety-critical deployment programs are extremely scarce.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG/AV TPM Offer:** "I have a TPM offer from [Google/Waymo/Amazon] at $[X] TC. Baidu's Apollo deployment programs are uniquely complex."
2. **Safety-Critical Program Expertise:** "My [safety certification/regulatory program/hardware-software deployment] experience enables Apollo's city launches."
3. **Cross-Border Coordination:** "My ability to manage US-China programs is essential for Baidu's operating model."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[30K-45K] sign-on offsets transition costs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and 15% bonus. Apollo's city deployment programs are the most complex TPM challenges in AV. I have a competing offer from [Google/Waymo] TPM at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+45K] and a $35K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
