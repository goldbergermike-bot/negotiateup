**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Baidu shape experiences spanning search (China's dominant search engine), Apollo Go (robotaxi rider app and in-vehicle UX), and ERNIE AI (conversational AI interface design). The intersection of AI and UX is Baidu's design frontier -- designing interfaces that make AI capabilities intuitive and trustworthy for hundreds of millions of users.

US-based designers focus on Apollo's rider experience, international product UX, and AI interface patterns. Compensation is competitive with mid-tier tech design roles.
