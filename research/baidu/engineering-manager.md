**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Baidu's US offices lead teams focused on Apollo's autonomous driving technology and AI research. The US EM function has grown as Baidu invests in retaining and expanding its American R&D presence. EMs at Baidu must navigate cross-cultural dynamics between US and Beijing teams while maintaining Silicon Valley engineering standards.

Compensation for EMs is competitive, with Baidu authorized to match offers from AV companies (Waymo, Cruise, Aurora) and FAANG. Sign-on bonuses and above-band RSU grants are available for experienced managers.

**Level Mapping:** Engineering Manager at Baidu (T7+) = M1-M2 at Google, M1-M2 at Meta, SDM at Amazon

**The AV Team Growth Premium**
