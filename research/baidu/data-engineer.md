### Data Engineer | Baidu Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $40B market cap with China's largest search data corpus + Apollo AV sensor data at massive scale + ERNIE training data pipelines + Competitive US R&D comp | Baidu data engineers process search, AV, and AI training data at extraordinary scale | **SEARCH + AV DATA PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Bay Area / Sunnyvale (US R&D) | $150K–$210K | $55K–$165K | 15% | $195K–$310K |
| Seattle (US) | $145K–$205K | $50K–$160K | 15% | $190K–$300K |
| Beijing (HQ) | CNY 400K–CNY 720K | CNY 140K–CNY 410K | 15–25% | CNY 580K–CNY 1.15M |
| Shanghai | CNY 380K–CNY 690K | CNY 130K–CNY 390K | 15–25% | CNY 550K–CNY 1.1M |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Baidu build pipelines across three distinct data domains: search (processing billions of daily queries from 600M+ users), autonomous driving (petabytes of LiDAR, camera, and radar sensor data from Apollo's fleet), and AI training (massive datasets for ERNIE LLM training). This data diversity creates uniquely versatile data engineering challenges.

US-based data engineers focus on Apollo's sensor data pipelines, ERNIE training data infrastructure, and search analytics. Compensation is competitive with mid-tier tech companies.

**Level Mapping:** Data Engineer at Baidu (T4-T6) = L3-L5 at Google, IC3-IC5 at Meta, DE II-Senior at Amazon

**The Multi-Modal Data Premium**

Baidu's data engineering spans text (search), sensor fusion (AV), and multimodal training data (ERNIE) -- a combination no other company offers. Data engineers who can work across these modalities develop highly transferable expertise.

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Platform Offer:** "I have an offer from [Snowflake/Databricks/Amazon] at $[X] TC. Baidu's multi-modal data challenges are unique."
2. **AV Data Expertise:** "My [sensor data/LiDAR pipeline/point cloud processing] experience directly advances Apollo's data infrastructure."
3. **Search Data Scale:** "My search data engineering experience applies to Baidu's core 600M+ user product."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[30K-45K] sign-on offsets my unvested equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and 15% bonus. Baidu's multi-modal data challenges across search, AV, and AI are compelling. I have a competing offer from [Snowflake/Amazon] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+45K] and a $35K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
