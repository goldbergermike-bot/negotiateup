**Negotiation DNA**

Baidu is China's dominant search engine with 600M+ MAU, the developer of ERNIE (one of China's leading large language models), and the operator of Apollo (the world's most commercially deployed autonomous driving platform). Software Engineers at Baidu's US offices work on search infrastructure, AI/ML platforms, autonomous driving technology, and cloud services (Baidu AI Cloud).

Baidu's US compensation has improved in recent years as the company competes for AI and AV talent, though it typically trails FAANG by 10-20%. The company compensates with meaningful RSU grants (BIDU is NASDAQ-listed), competitive bonuses, and the opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI and AV technology. In China, Baidu uses a T-level system (T3-T10) for engineers, with most experienced hires landing at T5-T7.

**Level Mapping:** Software Engineer at Baidu (T4-T6) = L3-L5 at Google, IC3-IC5 at Meta, SDE I-III at Amazon

**The AI Transformation Premium**

Baidu's transformation from a search company to an AI-first company (search, ERNIE LLM, Apollo AV, AI Cloud) creates diverse engineering opportunities. Engineers who join during this transformation phase work on products at the frontier of AI commercialization.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Google/Meta/Amazon] at $[X] TC. Baidu's AI and AV technology is genuinely compelling."
2. **AI/ML Expertise:** "My [NLP/search/LLM/deep learning] experience directly applies to Baidu's core AI initiatives."
3. **AV Interest:** "Access to Apollo's commercial AV platform is a unique opportunity that adds non-monetary value."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[30K-50K] sign-on offsets my unvested equity and reflects the competitive talent market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and 15% bonus. Baidu's AI transformation -- ERNIE, Apollo, AI Cloud -- is compelling. I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+45K] and a $35K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
