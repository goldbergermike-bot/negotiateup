**Negotiation DNA**

McKinsey's internal technology organization builds the platforms, tools, and digital products that power the firm's consulting operations and client deliverables. Software Engineers at McKinsey work on internal tools, data platforms, and increasingly on AI-powered products that consultants use in client engagements. McKinsey does not offer equity to non-partner employees — compensation is entirely base salary + performance bonus. The performance bonus ranges from 25-50% of base and is determined by individual performance ratings, practice area profitability, and overall firm financial results. Because there is no equity component, your base salary negotiation is the single most important lever — it compounds through bonus calculations and future raises.

**Level Mapping:** McKinsey Software Engineer = Google L3-L4 = Meta E3-E4 = Amazon SDE I-II

**Global Levers**

1. **No-Equity Gap Frame:** "My competing offers from [Google/Meta/Amazon] include $100K-$200K in RSUs over 4 years. Since McKinsey doesn't offer equity, I need the base salary to compensate for that structural gap in total comp."
2. **Consulting Revenue Enablement:** "McKinsey generates $16B+ in annual revenue. The technology I build directly enables consultants to deliver higher-quality work faster. Each internal tool I build is leveraged across 30,000+ consultants — the productivity multiplier is enormous."
3. **Bonus Guarantee Request:** "I understand bonus is performance-based, but I'd like a guaranteed minimum first-year bonus of 35% to de-risk my transition from a more predictable equity-based comp structure."
4. **Signing Bonus Bridge:** Push for a $25K-$40K signing bonus to offset the lack of equity. McKinsey regularly uses signing bonuses for competitive hires from tech companies.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about McKinsey's technology mission, but the absence of equity means I need the base to do more heavy lifting. I'm targeting $190K base with a guaranteed first-year bonus floor of 35%. I'd also like a $35K signing bonus to bridge the gap from my current equity vesting schedule." McKinsey will likely counter at $175K-$185K base with standard bonus terms. Accept if total first-year comp (base + guaranteed bonus + signing) reaches $265K+.
