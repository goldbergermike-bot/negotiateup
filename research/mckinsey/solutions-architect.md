**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at McKinsey bridge the gap between consulting strategy and technology implementation. You design the technical architecture for client engagements — translating McKinsey's strategic recommendations into implementable technology solutions. This is a client-facing role: you present architecture diagrams to CTOs, evaluate vendor solutions, and design enterprise systems. Solutions Architects at McKinsey occupy a unique position — they have the credibility of McKinsey's consulting brand combined with deep technical expertise. Comp is base + performance bonus (30-50%), with client-facing roles tending toward the higher bonus end. McKinsey's growing technology implementation practice depends on SAs who can credibly sell and deliver complex architecture work. [Source: McKinsey Technology Implementation Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** McKinsey Solutions Architect = AWS Senior SA = Google Cloud Customer Engineer (L5) = Accenture Managing Director (Tech)

**Global Levers**

1. **Client Billing Rate Leverage:** "Solutions Architects on McKinsey engagements are billed at $500-$800/hour to clients. At 1,200+ billable hours/year, I generate $600K-$960K in direct revenue. My comp at $250K-$350K represents a healthy margin — I'm asking for a modest improvement."
2. **Pre-Sales Technical Win Rate:** "My architecture presentations and technical credibility directly influence whether McKinsey wins $5M-$20M implementation engagements. I'm not just delivering work — I'm helping sell it."
3. **Consulting Track Equivalence:** "Solutions Architects at McKinsey are equivalent to senior Engagement Managers or Associate Partners on the consulting track ($300K-$500K TC). My comp should reflect that equivalence."
4. **Implementation Practice Growth:** "McKinsey's technology implementation practice is growing 25%+ annually. The firm is investing heavily in moving beyond strategy-only to end-to-end delivery. SAs are the linchpin of this expansion."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm the technical face of McKinsey's implementation practice — selling and delivering architecture work to CTOs. I need $230K base with a 35% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $40K signing bonus. My consulting rate generates $700K+ in client revenue annually." McKinsey will counter at $210K-$220K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $330K.
