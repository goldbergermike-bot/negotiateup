**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at McKinsey are responsible for the cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and platform reliability that support both the firm's internal technology and QuantumBlack's client-facing AI deployments. McKinsey's technology stack has undergone a massive cloud-native transformation, and DevOps engineers are central to this effort. The firm runs on AWS and Azure, with increasing Kubernetes adoption for QuantumBlack workloads. McKinsey does not offer equity; total comp is base + performance bonus (25-45%). DevOps at McKinsey has a unique twist: you may also support client engagements, helping Fortune 500 companies design and implement their own DevOps transformations.

**Level Mapping:** McKinsey DevOps Engineer = Google L3-L4 SRE = Amazon SDE II (Infra) = Datadog DevOps Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Reliability = Revenue:** "McKinsey's entire consulting operation depends on the platforms I maintain. A major outage during a client engagement could cost the firm millions in reputation and revenue. My infrastructure work is directly tied to business continuity."
2. **Cloud Transformation Investment:** "McKinsey is investing $500M+ in technology modernization. DevOps engineers are the backbone of this transformation. My work accelerates the ROI on this investment."
3. **Client Engagement Upside:** "If I'm also supporting client-facing DevOps engagements, those are billed at consulting rates ($300-$500/hr). My dual role as internal engineer and client delivery resource doubles my value to the firm."
4. **No-Equity Market Adjustment:** "DevOps engineers at comparable companies earn $200K-$300K TC with equity. McKinsey's cash structure needs to close this gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm enabling McKinsey's cloud transformation and supporting QuantumBlack deployments. I need $190K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $25K signing bonus. My tech alternatives offer $250K-$300K TC with equity." McKinsey will counter at $170K-$180K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $245K+.
