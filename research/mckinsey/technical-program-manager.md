**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at McKinsey coordinate complex multi-team engineering initiatives — platform migrations, security overhauls, QuantumBlack product launches, and technology transformation programs. McKinsey's TPM role is uniquely demanding because you're managing programs that involve both technology teams and consulting practice leadership. You need to navigate the firm's partnership culture while driving engineering execution with the rigor of a tech company. McKinsey does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (25-45%). TPMs who successfully deliver high-visibility programs (like the Lilli AI launch or major platform migrations) earn bonuses at the top of the range.

**Level Mapping:** McKinsey TPM = Google L5 TPM = Meta E5 TPM = Amazon Sr. TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Program Scale Impact:** "I manage programs involving $10M-$50M+ in technology investment. The successful delivery of these programs — on time, on budget — directly determines the ROI of McKinsey's technology strategy."
2. **Cross-Organizational Complexity:** "McKinsey's TPM role requires navigating both engineering teams and a partner-driven consulting culture. This dual-stakeholder complexity warrants a premium over standard tech company TPM roles."
3. **Delivery Risk Mitigation:** "Program failures at McKinsey's scale cost millions in wasted investment and months in lost time. My ability to de-risk and deliver complex programs is worth a multiple of my compensation."
4. **No-Equity Market Adjustment:** "TPMs at Google, Meta, and Amazon earn $280K-$400K TC with significant equity. McKinsey needs to close this gap with competitive base and guaranteed bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm driving delivery of McKinsey's most critical technology programs. I need $210K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $30K signing bonus. My tech alternatives offer $300K-$380K TC with equity." McKinsey will counter at $190K-$200K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $285K.
