### Data Engineer | McKinsey Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (25-50%) | No Equity | Data Platform Critical Role

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $160K-$200K | None | $40K-$100K (25-50%) | $200K-$300K |
| Chicago | $150K-$190K | None | $38K-$95K (25-50%) | $188K-$285K |
| Bangalore | ₹26L-₹42L | None | ₹7L-₹21L (25-50%) | ₹33L-₹63L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at McKinsey build the data infrastructure that powers both QuantumBlack's AI practice and the firm's internal analytics capabilities. McKinsey's consulting engagements increasingly depend on data pipelines, data lakes, and real-time analytics — making data engineering a critical enabler of the firm's highest-margin services. McKinsey does not offer equity; compensation is base + performance bonus (25-50%). Data Engineers work across client engagements and internal platforms, giving you exposure to Fortune 500 data architectures across every industry. The firm's investment in QuantumBlack and its Lilli AI assistant has created urgency around building robust data foundations. [Source: McKinsey QuantumBlack Data Infrastructure 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** McKinsey Data Engineer = Google L3-L4 Data Engineer = Databricks Senior DE = Snowflake DE

**Global Levers**

1. **QuantumBlack Data Foundation:** "Every AI model QuantumBlack deploys depends on data engineering. I'm building the foundation that the firm's highest-revenue AI practice runs on. Without reliable data pipelines, QuantumBlack can't deliver."
2. **Cross-Client Data Architecture:** "I'll build data solutions across 10-20+ client engagements per year, each billed at premium consulting rates. The reusable frameworks I create multiply the firm's delivery capacity."
3. **No-Equity Compensation Push:** "Data engineers at Databricks/Snowflake earn $250K-$350K TC with significant equity upside. McKinsey's cash-only structure needs to close that gap through base and guaranteed bonus."
4. **Lilli AI Infrastructure:** "McKinsey's Lilli AI assistant requires robust data infrastructure to function. My work directly enables the firm's flagship AI product that every consultant uses daily."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the data infrastructure that powers QuantumBlack and Lilli. I'd like $195K base with a guaranteed first-year bonus of 30% and a $30K signing bonus. My alternatives in tech offer $280K-$330K TC with equity." McKinsey will counter at $175K-$185K base. Accept if total first-year comp (base + bonus + signing) reaches $265K+.
