**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at McKinsey lead technical design and delivery of the firm's most important internal platforms. At this level, you're expected to architect systems, mentor junior engineers, and interface with senior consulting leadership on technology strategy. McKinsey's no-equity structure means this is a pure cash compensation negotiation. The performance bonus at the senior level trends toward the higher end of the 30-50% range for strong performers. McKinsey's technology org has been investing heavily in modernizing its internal platform — migrating to cloud-native, building AI/ML infrastructure, and developing proprietary analytics tools. Senior engineers who can lead these transformation efforts are in high demand. [Source: McKinsey Digital & Technology Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** McKinsey Senior Software Engineer = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Amazon SDE III

**Global Levers**

1. **Architecture Leadership Premium:** "At this level, I'm not just writing code — I'm making architectural decisions that affect McKinsey's entire technology platform. The leverage of a senior engineer's decisions is 10-50x that of an individual contributor."
2. **Tech-to-Consulting Gap Closer:** "Senior engineers at Google/Meta earn $350K-$450K TC with equity. McKinsey needs to close this gap through base and guaranteed bonus, or the firm will continue losing senior technical talent to FAANG."
3. **Bonus Floor Negotiation:** "I want a written guarantee that my first-year bonus will be at minimum 35% of base, with upside to 50% based on performance. This gives me confidence in the total comp package without equity."
4. **Knowledge Retention Value:** "Replacing a senior engineer costs 1.5-2x annual salary in recruiting, onboarding, and lost productivity. Investing an additional $20K-$30K in my base is a fraction of the replacement cost."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a senior-level role without equity, I need the base at $210K with a guaranteed first-year bonus of 35% minimum. I'd also like a $40K signing bonus to compensate for the equity cliff from my current role. My FAANG alternatives are at $380K-$420K TC." McKinsey will counter at $195K-$205K base. Push firmly on the signing bonus and bonus guarantee. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $300K.
