**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at McKinsey protect the firm's most sensitive asset: client confidentiality. McKinsey handles strategy-level secrets for virtually every Fortune 500 company — merger plans, competitive intelligence, transformation strategies. A security breach at McKinsey wouldn't just be a data incident; it would be an existential threat to the firm's trust-based business model. This makes security engineering at McKinsey uniquely high-stakes. Security engineers also support QuantumBlack AI deployments, ensuring that client data used in ML models is handled with appropriate controls. McKinsey does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (25-45%). The firm has significantly increased security investment following industry-wide incidents.

**Global Levers**

1. **Client Confidentiality Premium:** "McKinsey's entire business depends on client trust. A single security breach could cost the firm billions in lost relationships. My work directly protects the firm's most critical asset — its reputation for confidentiality."
2. **Regulatory Compliance Complexity:** "McKinsey operates across 65+ countries with varying data sovereignty, privacy, and security regulations. The complexity of securing a global consulting firm exceeds most tech companies."
3. **QuantumBlack AI Security:** "As McKinsey deploys more AI/ML solutions for clients, the security implications multiply. I'm securing AI systems that handle Fortune 500 client data — the stakes are exponentially higher."
4. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers are the most supply-constrained role in tech. The market pays $250K-$400K TC at comparable tech companies. McKinsey needs to offer competitive cash comp to attract scarce security talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm protecting the confidentiality that McKinsey's entire business model depends on. I need $205K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $30K signing bonus. Security engineers are the scarcest talent in the market, and my alternatives offer $280K-$350K TC with equity." McKinsey will counter at $185K-$195K base. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $275K.
