### ML/AI Engineer | McKinsey Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Base-Heavy + Performance Bonus (30-50%) | No Equity | QuantumBlack AI Delivery

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| New York | $175K-$230K | None | $53K-$115K (30-50%) | $228K-$345K |
| Chicago | $165K-$215K | None | $50K-$108K (30-50%) | $215K-$323K |
| London | £115K-£160K | None | £35K-£80K (30-50%) | £150K-£240K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at McKinsey build production machine learning systems for both internal use and client-facing QuantumBlack engagements. This role bridges the gap between research-oriented Data Scientists and production-oriented Software Engineers — you take ML models from prototype to deployment at scale. McKinsey's Lilli AI assistant, QuantumBlack's client solutions, and the firm's internal analytics all depend on ML/AI Engineers to move from concept to production. McKinsey does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (30-50%). The AI talent war has forced McKinsey to significantly increase compensation for ML roles over the past 2 years, but the firm still trails FAANG and AI-native companies. Use competing offers aggressively. [Source: McKinsey QuantumBlack ML Engineering 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** McKinsey ML/AI Engineer = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta E4-E5 ML = Anthropic Research Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **Production ML Scarcity:** "Engineers who can take ML models from notebook to production are exceptionally rare. Most ML talent is research-focused. My production ML skills directly enable QuantumBlack to deliver — not just prototype — AI solutions."
2. **Lilli AI Investment:** "McKinsey's Lilli AI assistant is the firm's most visible technology investment. ML engineers building and improving Lilli are working on a product used by every consultant in the firm."
3. **Client Delivery Revenue:** "Each QuantumBlack ML engagement generates $3M-$10M in client fees. My ability to deploy production ML systems is what converts those contracts from promises into delivered value."
4. **AI Talent Market Pressure:** "ML/AI engineers command $300K-$500K TC at Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic. McKinsey's base + bonus structure needs to be competitive with at least the lower end of that range."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I bring production ML expertise that bridges QuantumBlack's research capabilities with client delivery. I need $225K base with a 35% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $35K signing bonus. My competing offers from AI companies are at $350K-$420K TC with equity." McKinsey will counter at $200K-$215K base. Accept if total first-year comp (base + guaranteed bonus + signing) exceeds $310K.
