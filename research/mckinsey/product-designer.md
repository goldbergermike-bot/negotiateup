**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at McKinsey work within McKinsey Digital and McKinsey Design (formerly Lunar) to create enterprise-grade digital products, client-facing prototypes, and internal tools. McKinsey's design practice is uniquely positioned — designers work alongside consultants and engineers to deliver end-to-end digital solutions for Fortune 500 clients. This is not a typical in-house design role: you'll design products that are presented to C-suites and deployed across massive enterprises. McKinsey does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (25-45%). The design practice has grown significantly as McKinsey expands its digital implementation capabilities beyond pure strategy advice. [Source: McKinsey Design Practice 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** McKinsey Product Designer = Google L4 UX Designer = Meta IC4 Product Designer = Figma Senior Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Client-Facing Design Premium:** "I'm not designing internal tools — I'm creating products presented to Fortune 500 CEOs. The design quality directly impacts whether McKinsey wins and retains $5M-$20M consulting engagements."
2. **McKinsey Design Brand:** "McKinsey Design (formerly Lunar) is a recognized design brand. My work carries the McKinsey imprimatur, which means higher quality standards and higher impact than typical in-house design roles."
3. **No-Equity Compensation Gap:** "Product designers at Figma, Airbnb, and Google earn $200K-$350K TC with equity. McKinsey needs to close this gap through base and guaranteed bonus."
4. **Design-Led Consulting Growth:** "McKinsey is increasingly winning engagements on the strength of its design and implementation capabilities — not just strategy. Investing in design talent directly drives the firm's revenue growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm bringing enterprise design expertise to McKinsey's highest-value client engagements. I need $185K base with a 30% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $25K signing bonus. My alternatives in tech offer $250K-$320K TC with equity." McKinsey will counter at $165K-$175K base. Accept if total first-year comp reaches $240K+.
