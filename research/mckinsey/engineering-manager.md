**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at McKinsey lead teams of 6-15 engineers building the firm's technology platforms, QuantumBlack solutions, and internal tools. This role exists at the intersection of technology leadership and consulting firm culture — you need to manage engineers effectively while also communicating with senior partners who may not have technical backgrounds. McKinsey's EM role carries more organizational influence than at most tech companies because technology decisions at McKinsey directly impact how 30,000+ consultants deliver client work. Bonus at this level trends toward 30-50%, with strong performers consistently hitting 40%+. McKinsey has been building out its technology management layer aggressively, recognizing that the firm needs experienced tech leaders, not just converted consultants.

**Global Levers**

1. **Consulting Parity Frame:** "Engineering Managers at McKinsey are equivalent to Engagement Managers on the consulting track, who earn $250K-$400K TC. My comp should approach parity — both roles lead teams and drive outcomes for the firm."
2. **Team Productivity Multiplier:** "I manage a team that costs the firm $1.5M-$2.5M annually in compensation. A 20% improvement in my team's productivity — which strong engineering management delivers — is worth $300K-$500K/year. My comp is a small fraction of this value."
3. **Recruiting Advantage:** "A strong Engineering Manager is the #1 factor in whether engineers stay or leave. Investing in my comp directly reduces attrition costs across my entire team."
4. **Bonus Guarantee + Signing:** "I need a guaranteed first-year bonus of 35% minimum plus a $40K signing bonus. This compensates for the equity I'm leaving behind and demonstrates McKinsey's commitment to competitive tech leadership comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm leading critical engineering teams and bridging the gap between technology and consulting leadership. I need $245K base with a 35% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $45K signing bonus. My competing offers are at $400K-$500K TC with equity." McKinsey will counter at $220K-$235K base. Push on the signing bonus — this is where McKinsey has the most flexibility. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $340K.
