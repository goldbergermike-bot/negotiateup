**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at McKinsey define and drive the strategy for the firm's internal technology products — including Lilli (the AI assistant), QuantumBlack analytics tools, and the digital platforms consultants use daily. This role is distinct from McKinsey's consulting PMs (who advise clients on product strategy) — you own the product roadmap and outcomes for McKinsey's own technology. PMs at McKinsey have outsized influence because their products serve 30,000+ internal users (consultants) and increasingly external clients. McKinsey does not offer equity; comp is base + performance bonus (30-50%). Strong PMs at McKinsey often earn bonuses at the top of the range because their products directly impact consultant productivity and firm revenue.

**Level Mapping:** McKinsey Product Manager = Google L5 PM = Meta E5 PM = Amazon L6 PM-T

**Global Levers**

1. **Internal Product Impact:** "McKinsey's 30,000+ consultants use the products I build every day. A 10% improvement in consultant productivity from better tools translates to hundreds of millions in additional capacity."
2. **Lilli AI Ownership:** If your role touches Lilli: "I'm shaping McKinsey's most strategic internal product — an AI assistant that the entire firm depends on. This is the equivalent of being a PM at an AI startup, but with McKinsey's scale."
3. **Consulting Track Parity:** "Associate Partners on the consulting track earn $300K-$450K. As a PM leading product strategy for the firm's technology, my comp should approach that range."
4. **No-Equity Tech Alternative:** "PMs at Google, Meta, and Stripe earn $300K-$500K TC with substantial equity. McKinsey's cash structure needs to close this gap through base and guaranteed bonus."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm driving product strategy for tools that impact every consultant at McKinsey. I need $220K base with a 35% guaranteed first-year bonus and a $35K signing bonus. My tech offers are at $350K-$450K TC with equity." McKinsey will counter at $195K-$210K base. Push firmly on the signing bonus. Accept if total first-year comp exceeds $310K.
