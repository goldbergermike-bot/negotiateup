**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Sea Group build pipelines spanning three distinct data domains: Shopee (2B+ orders, merchant analytics, search/recommendation data), Garena (100M+ gamer behavioral data, in-game economy analytics), and SeaMoney (financial transaction data, credit scoring data). This triple-domain data diversity creates uniquely versatile data engineering challenges.
