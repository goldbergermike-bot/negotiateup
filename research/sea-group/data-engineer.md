**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Sea Group build pipelines spanning three distinct data domains: Shopee (2B+ orders, merchant analytics, search/recommendation data), Garena (100M+ gamer behavioral data, in-game economy analytics), and SeaMoney (financial transaction data, credit scoring data). This triple-domain data diversity creates uniquely versatile data engineering challenges.

**Level Mapping:** Data Engineer at Sea Group (L4-L6) = L3-L5 at Google, IC3-IC5 at Meta, DE II-Senior at Amazon

**The E-Commerce + Gaming Data Premium**

Few companies generate both e-commerce transaction data and gaming behavioral data at Sea Group's scale. Data engineers who can build pipelines across these domains develop highly transferable expertise.

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Platform Offer:** "I have an offer from [Snowflake/Databricks/Grab] at $[X] TC."
2. **E-Commerce Data Scale:** "My experience with 2B+ order data pipelines applies to Shopee's platform."
3. **Gaming Analytics:** "My gaming data pipeline experience is relevant to Garena's platform."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[25K-35K] / SGD [20K-30K] sign-on offsets transition costs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Sea Group's triple-domain data challenges are compelling. I have a competing offer at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+35K] and a $30K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
