**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Sea Group build models across three platforms: Shopee (search ranking, product recommendations, image recognition, fraud detection), Garena (game AI, player matchmaking, cheat detection), and SeaMoney (credit scoring, fraud detection, risk modeling). The cross-platform data advantage enables models that leverage shopping behavior, gaming patterns, and financial data together.
