**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Sea Group manage infrastructure supporting Shopee's extreme traffic spikes (11.11 sales events generate millions of orders per hour), Garena's real-time gaming infrastructure (low-latency requirements for competitive gaming), and SeaMoney's financial systems (bank-grade reliability). The multi-country deployment across 10+ markets adds infrastructure complexity.

**Level Mapping:** DevOps Engineer at Sea Group (L4-L6) = L3-L5 SRE at Google, IC3-IC5 PE at Meta, SysDE at Amazon

**The Sales Event Scaling Premium**

Shopee's 11.11 and 12.12 sales events create traffic spikes rivaling Alibaba's Singles' Day. DevOps engineers who can build auto-scaling infrastructure for these extreme events develop expertise that is highly valued.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cloud/SRE Offer:** "I have an SRE offer from [Google/Amazon Singapore] at $[X] TC."
2. **E-Commerce Scaling:** "My high-concurrency infrastructure experience directly enables Shopee's sales events."
3. **Gaming Infrastructure:** "My low-latency gaming infrastructure experience applies to Garena."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[25K-35K] / SGD [20K-30K] sign-on offsets transition costs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Sea Group's infrastructure challenges -- 11.11 scaling, gaming latency, fintech reliability -- are extraordinary. I have a competing offer at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+35K] and a $30K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
