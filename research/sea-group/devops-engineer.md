DevOps Engineers at Sea Group manage infrastructure supporting Shopee's extreme traffic spikes (11.11 sales events generate millions of orders per hour), Garena's real-time gaming infrastructure (low-latency requirements for competitive gaming), and SeaMoney's financial systems (bank-grade reliability). The multi-country deployment across 10+ markets adds infrastructure complexity.

**The Sales Event Scaling Premium**

Shopee's 11.11 and 12.12 sales events create traffic spikes rivaling Alibaba's Singles' Day. DevOps engineers who can build auto-scaling infrastructure for these extreme events develop expertise that is highly valued.
