**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Sea Group own products across three major platforms: Shopee (marketplace optimization, seller tools, live commerce, logistics), Garena (game publishing strategy, esports, community features), and SeaMoney (digital wallet, lending, banking products). PMs must navigate multi-market product-market fit across 10+ countries with vastly different consumer behaviors.

**Level Mapping:** PM at Sea Group (L6-L7) = L5-L6 PM at Google, IC5-IC6 PM at Meta, Sr PM at Amazon

**The Multi-Market Commerce PM Premium**

Shopee PMs gain experience launching and optimizing e-commerce features across SE Asia, Taiwan, and Brazil simultaneously. This multi-market PM expertise is highly transferable to any global tech company.

2. **E-Commerce PM Expertise:** "My marketplace/e-commerce PM experience directly drives Shopee's growth."
3. **Live Commerce:** "My live commerce/social shopping PM experience advances Shopee's fastest-growing channel."
