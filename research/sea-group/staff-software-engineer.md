**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Sea Group (L8+) define architectural direction across three major platforms. At this level, engineers make decisions that span Shopee's e-commerce infrastructure (2B+ orders), Garena's gaming platform (100M+ Free Fire MAU), and SeaMoney's financial services. Staff-level talent is extremely scarce in Singapore, and Sea Group is authorized to match Google L6 and Meta IC6 Singapore offers.

**Level Mapping:** Staff SWE at Sea Group (L8+) = L6 at Google, IC6 at Meta, Principal at Amazon

**The Triple-Platform Architecture Premium**

Staff engineers who can architect shared systems spanning e-commerce, gaming, and fintech possess a uniquely broad technical perspective. This cross-domain architecture experience is rare and commands premium compensation.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG L6 Offer:** "I have an L6 offer from [Google/Meta Singapore] at $[X] TC."
2. **Cross-Platform Scope:** "My architectural decisions span 3 platforms and 10+ markets -- L6-equivalent scope."
3. **E-Commerce + Fintech:** "My combined e-commerce and fintech architecture experience is rare."
4. **Sign-On + Refresher:** "I need a $[70K-100K] / SGD [60K-85K] sign-on and refresher clarity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Defining Sea Group's architecture across Shopee, Garena, and SeaMoney is extraordinary. I have a competing L6 offer at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+100K] and a $80K sign-on. TC should reach $[target]."
