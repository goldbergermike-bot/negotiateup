**Negotiation DNA**

Sea Group operates three major platforms: Shopee (SE Asia's #1 e-commerce marketplace), Garena (gaming platform publishing Free Fire, one of the world's most popular mobile games with 100M+ MAU), and SeaMoney (digital financial services including ShopeePay and digital banking). Software Engineers at Sea Group can work across e-commerce, gaming, or fintech -- a breadth of product opportunities unmatched by any other SE Asian tech company.

Sea Group's compensation philosophy emphasizes growth-stage equity: RSU grants are generous relative to Singapore market norms, with SE stock (NYSE-listed) providing liquidity. The company recruits from Grab, Google Singapore, ByteDance, and Chinese tech companies, offering competitive packages. Base salaries are competitive with Singapore tech market rates, and sign-on bonuses are available for candidates with competing offers.

**Level Mapping:** Software Engineer at Sea Group (L4-L6) = L3-L4 at Google, IC3-IC4 at Meta, SDE I-II at Amazon

**The Three-Platform Premium**

Sea Group's three business lines create unique career optionality: engineers can move between e-commerce (Shopee), gaming (Garena), and fintech (SeaMoney) within the same company, developing cross-domain expertise that is rare and highly valued.

**Global Levers**

1. **Tech Company Offer:** "I have an offer from [Grab/Google Singapore/ByteDance] at $[X] TC. Sea Group's product breadth is compelling."
2. **E-Commerce Scale:** "My [marketplace/search/transaction] experience applies to Shopee's 2B+ annual orders."
3. **Gaming Technology:** "My gaming engineering experience is directly relevant to Garena's platform."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[25K-40K] / SGD [20K-35K] sign-on offsets transition costs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Sea Group's triple-platform opportunity is unique. I have a competing offer from [Grab/Google] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+40K] and a $30K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
