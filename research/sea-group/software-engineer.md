**Negotiation DNA**

Sea Group operates three major platforms: Shopee (SE Asia's #1 e-commerce marketplace), Garena (gaming platform publishing Free Fire, one of the world's most popular mobile games with 100M+ MAU), and SeaMoney (digital financial services including ShopeePay and digital banking). Software Engineers at Sea Group can work across e-commerce, gaming, or fintech -- a breadth of product opportunities unmatched by any other SE Asian tech company.

Sea Group's compensation philosophy emphasizes growth-stage equity: RSU grants are generous relative to Singapore market norms, with SE stock (NYSE-listed) providing liquidity. The company recruits from Grab, Google Singapore, ByteDance, and Chinese tech companies, offering competitive packages. Base salaries are competitive with Singapore tech market rates, and sign-on bonuses are available for candidates with competing offers.

**Level Mapping:** Software Engineer at Sea Group (L4-L6) = L3-L4 at Google, IC3-IC4 at Meta, SDE I-II at Amazon

**The Three-Platform Premium**

Sea Group's three business lines create unique career optionality: engineers can move between e-commerce (Shopee), gaming (Garena), and fintech (SeaMoney) within the same company, developing cross-domain expertise that is rare and highly valued.
