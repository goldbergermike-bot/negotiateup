**Negotiation DNA**

Shopee is Southeast Asia's largest e-commerce platform, processing over 2 billion orders annually across markets including Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Brazil. Shopee Platform Engineers build the core infrastructure: search and discovery, order management, payment processing (ShopeePay), logistics orchestration, merchant tools, and the live-streaming commerce platform (Shopee LIVE). The scale of operations -- millions of concurrent users during sales events like 9.9, 11.11, and 12.12 -- creates infrastructure challenges comparable to Alibaba and Amazon.

Sea Group's compensation philosophy is growth-oriented: RSU grants are generous relative to Singapore peers, reflecting the company's hyper-growth trajectory. SE stock (NYSE-listed) has been volatile but has shown strong upside periods, making equity a potentially lucrative component. The company recruits aggressively from Grab, ByteDance, Google, and Alibaba, and is willing to pay premiums for engineers who can operate at e-commerce scale.

Platform engineers at Shopee face unique challenges: the marketplace must work across countries with vastly different logistics infrastructure, payment methods, and consumer behaviors. During 11.11 sales events, the platform handles traffic spikes that rival Singles' Day at Alibaba, requiring similar auto-scaling and reliability engineering capabilities.

**The E-Commerce Scale Premium**

Shopee's 2B+ annual orders and extreme traffic during sales events (11.11 peak exceeds 1 million orders per minute) create infrastructure challenges at Alibaba/Amazon scale. Platform engineers who have survived and optimized for these events develop e-commerce engineering skills that are highly transferable. Shopee's live-streaming commerce platform adds another layer of complexity -- real-time video, chat, and transactions must work seamlessly during high-traffic live sales.

The company's expansion into Brazil (Shopee Brazil is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Latin America) means platform engineers must build systems that work across Asian and Latin American markets -- a geographic breadth that few e-commerce platforms face.

**Global Levers**

1. **E-Commerce Competing Offer:** "I have an offer from [Amazon/Alibaba/Shopify] at $[X] TC. Shopee's transaction scale and multi-market complexity are comparable to the world's largest e-commerce platforms."
2. **Peak Traffic Expertise:** "My experience handling [high-concurrency/extreme traffic spikes/e-commerce scale] events directly applies to Shopee's 11.11/12.12 campaigns."
3. **Live Commerce Value:** "My [live streaming/real-time systems/video platform] experience directly advances Shopee LIVE -- the fastest-growing commerce channel in SE Asia."
4. **Multi-Market Platform:** "My multi-region platform experience applies to Shopee's operations across 10+ markets in Asia and Latin America."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Shopee's e-commerce scale -- 2B+ orders, 10+ markets -- is world-class. I have a competing offer from [Amazon/Alibaba] at $[W]K TC. To choose Sea Group, I need RSUs increased to $[Y+60K] and a $45K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
