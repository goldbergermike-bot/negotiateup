**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Sea Group analyze user behavior across three platforms: Shopee (search ranking, recommendation, conversion optimization, pricing), Garena (player engagement, monetization, matchmaking), and SeaMoney (credit risk, fraud detection, financial analytics). The ability to analyze patterns across commerce, gaming, and financial behavior creates insights no single-platform company can replicate.

**Level Mapping:** Data Scientist at Sea Group (L5-L7) = L4-L5 at Google, IC4-IC5 at Meta, DS Senior at Amazon

**The Commerce + Gaming Analytics Premium**

Understanding how gaming behavior predicts e-commerce purchasing patterns, or how payment data informs credit risk, creates analytical opportunities unique to Sea Group's three-platform structure.

**Global Levers**

1. **Tech DS Offer:** "I have a DS offer from [Meta/Google/Grab] at $[X] TC."
2. **Search/Recommendation:** "My search ranking and recommendation expertise directly improves Shopee's conversion."
3. **Gaming Analytics:** "My player engagement analytics experience applies to Garena's monetization."
4. **Credit Risk:** "My financial analytics experience enables SeaMoney's lending products."
