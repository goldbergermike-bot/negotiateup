### ML/AI Engineer — Rapyd Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Rapyd's Stablecoin Mainstream strategy, translating the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report (34% business adoption) into an ML/AI Engineer compensation framework spanning London, Tel Aviv, and San Francisco markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £82,000–£128,000 | £52,000–£105,000 | £134,000–£233,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪425,000–₪630,000 | ₪270,000–₪500,000 | ₪695,000–₪1,130,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $168,000–$240,000 | $92,000–$180,000 | $260,000–$420,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The ML/AI Engineer at Rapyd builds the intelligence systems that make a fintech-as-a-service platform processing 900+ payment methods across 100+ countries operationally viable at scale. With the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report confirming 34% business adoption, the ML challenge at Rapyd deepens dramatically. You are no longer just building fraud detection and payment routing models for fiat transactions — you are building Institutional-Grade Execution intelligence systems that operate across both traditional payment flows AND stablecoin settlement. Stablecoin settlement introduces entirely new ML challenges: on-chain fraud detection (bridge exploits, wash trading, smart contract manipulation), hybrid routing optimization (when to settle in stablecoins vs. fiat for cost and speed), stablecoin adoption prediction, and risk scoring across blockchain transaction graphs. The models you build run in production on live financial transactions where false positives block revenue and false negatives expose Rapyd to losses and regulatory penalties. ML/AI engineers who combine production financial ML expertise with blockchain analytics capability are among the most competitive hires in tech, with competing offers from Google, Meta, OpenAI, and every major fintech and crypto company.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Rapyd | Checkout.com | Airwallex | Nium | Stripe | Adyen |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| ML/AI Engineer | ML Engineer | ML Engineer | ML Engineer | ML Engineer | ML Engineer |
| Senior ML/AI Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer |

Checkout.com ML Engineers in London see £90K–£135K base with growth equity. Stripe ML Engineers in SF command $175K–$250K with liquid RSUs. Google L4-L5 MLEs offer $350K–$500K total comp with fully liquid equity. Meta and OpenAI compete aggressively at even higher levels. Rapyd must compensate for illiquidity with a compelling Stablecoin Mainstream upside narrative and significantly larger option grants.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report — 34% business adoption — creates an entirely new ML discipline within fintech: Institutional-Grade intelligence systems for stablecoin settlement.

Traditional payment ML (fraud detection, routing optimization, risk scoring) must now be extended to the stablecoin domain, where the data is fundamentally different. On-chain transaction graphs, smart contract interaction patterns, wallet behavior analysis, and cross-chain bridge monitoring all require novel ML approaches. The models must operate at Institutional-Grade standards: explainable enough for regulatory audit, reliable enough for enterprise customers, and fast enough for real-time settlement decisions.

The 34% adoption figure means this is not research — it is production ML that must work today. Stablecoin fraud vectors (bridge exploits, flash loan attacks, MEV exploitation) require detection models that don't exist off the shelf. Payment routing optimization across fiat AND stablecoin rails requires hybrid optimization models that no fintech has built at Rapyd's scale. The ML/AI engineer who builds these systems creates a new category of financial intelligence.

Your negotiation leverage is exceptional: ML/AI engineers are already the most competitive hire in tech, and adding the stablecoin/blockchain analytics dimension narrows the talent pool further. Every major tech company, fintech, and crypto firm is competing for the same talent — and most offer liquid equity.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Stablecoin ML Infrastructure:**
> "The Jan 2026 Stablecoins Report shows 34% business adoption. Rapyd needs ML systems that can detect fraud, score risk, and optimize routing across both fiat and stablecoin settlement in real time. This requires novel ML approaches operating on on-chain data — transaction graphs, smart contract interactions, wallet histories — that are fundamentally different from traditional payment data. This Institutional-Grade Execution ML scope justifies a base of $230K in SF with options at $170K annualized."

**Lever 2 — Dual-Domain ML Scarcity:**
> "ML engineers who have built production financial models AND understand blockchain analytics are vanishingly rare. The 34% adoption moment means every fintech and crypto company is hiring for this intersection simultaneously. I'm requesting a 30% illiquidity premium on the options grant to $175K annualized — this scarcity premium is necessary to offset Rapyd's illiquid equity against liquid offers from Google, Meta, and crypto-native companies."

**Lever 3 — Revenue Impact Through Intelligent Automation:**
> "Payment routing optimization across fiat and stablecoin rails could save Rapyd $10M+ annually if modeled correctly. Fraud auto-decisioning could eliminate 60-80% of manual reviews. These are the Institutional-Grade Execution gains the company needs. My bonus should be 20% of base tied to model-driven efficiency metrics: false positive reduction, routing cost savings, and automation coverage."

**Lever 4 — ML Talent Market Reality:**
> "ML/AI engineers with production financial ML experience have offers from Google, Meta, and AI-native companies at $400K–$550K in liquid total comp. Rapyd's illiquid options require me to accept significant liquidity risk. To make this work, I need total package at $400K+ with a $30,000 signing bonus and written provision for secondary sale access after 18 months."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target total comp of $375K–$420K in SF (£115K–£128K base London, ₪570K–₪630K base Tel Aviv). Anchor base at $215K–$240K in SF. Push for 30% illiquidity premium on options — target $140K–$180K annualized. Request a $30,000 signing bonus and secondary sale access after 18 months. Frame every ask around the Stablecoin Mainstream ML challenge, 34% adoption, and Institutional-Grade Execution intelligence systems. Accept-at floor: $198K base / $118K options annualized / $25K signing bonus in SF-equivalent terms — below this, Google, Meta, and Stripe ML offers with liquid equity are unambiguously superior.
