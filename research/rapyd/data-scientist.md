### Data Scientist — Rapyd Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Rapyd's Stablecoin Mainstream strategy, translating the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report (34% business adoption) into a Data Scientist compensation framework spanning London, Tel Aviv, and San Francisco markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £72,000–£112,000 | £42,000–£88,000 | £114,000–£200,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪365,000–₪550,000 | ₪210,000–₪420,000 | ₪575,000–₪970,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $152,000–$215,000 | $78,000–$155,000 | $230,000–$370,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Data Scientist at Rapyd works with one of the richest transaction datasets in fintech — billions of payment events across 900+ payment methods in 100+ countries. With the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report confirming 34% business adoption, the data science mandate at Rapyd has expanded from traditional payment analytics into a dual-domain challenge: optimizing both fiat payment flows AND stablecoin settlement economics. You are building the analytical intelligence that powers Rapyd's Institutional-Grade Execution strategy — modeling stablecoin settlement pricing, predicting adoption curves, analyzing on-chain transaction patterns alongside traditional payment data, and building the economic models that determine whether stablecoin settlement is profitable at scale across 100+ countries. Every insight you surface translates directly to basis points of margin improvement, and at Rapyd's transaction volume, a few basis points mean millions in revenue. Data scientists who combine payments domain expertise with the ability to analyze blockchain/stablecoin data are exceptionally scarce.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Rapyd | Checkout.com | Airwallex | Nium | Stripe | Adyen |

| Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Scientist |
| Senior Data Scientist | Senior DS | Senior DS | Senior DS | Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist |

Checkout.com Data Scientists in London see £80K–£120K base with growth equity. Stripe DS roles command $160K–$220K in SF with liquid RSUs. Google and Meta offer $350K–$450K total comp at senior DS level with fully liquid equity. Rapyd must compensate for illiquidity with the Stablecoin Mainstream upside thesis and larger option grants.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report's 34% business adoption figure creates an entirely new data science discipline within fintech: stablecoin settlement analytics. For Rapyd, this means the Data Scientist is no longer just optimizing fiat payment routing and fraud detection — you are building the analytical foundation for Institutional-Grade Execution of stablecoin settlement.

This includes modeling the economics of stablecoin settlement vs. traditional fiat settlement across every market where Rapyd operates. When does stablecoin settlement save money? In which corridors? For which transaction sizes? These are the questions your models will answer, and the answers will determine Rapyd's pricing strategy and competitive positioning.

The 34% adoption figure means this is not theoretical research — businesses are already using stablecoins and need data-driven answers about settlement optimization. The data scientist who builds the analytical models for mainstream stablecoin settlement economics will define a new subdiscipline. Your negotiation leverage comes from the scarcity of data scientists who understand both payment economics and blockchain/stablecoin data at the analytical depth required for Institutional-Grade Execution.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Stablecoin Settlement Economics Modeling:**
> "The Jan 2026 Stablecoins Report shows 34% business adoption. Rapyd needs a data scientist who can model the economics of stablecoin settlement vs. fiat settlement across 100+ countries — a novel analytical challenge. I'll build the pricing models that determine whether Rapyd's Institutional-Grade Execution strategy is profitable. This strategic modeling responsibility justifies a base of $205K in SF with options at $145K annualized."

**Lever 2 — Dual-Domain Analytics Premium:**
> "Analyzing both traditional payment data (interchange, settlement cycles, conversion rates) AND on-chain stablecoin data (gas costs, bridge economics, liquidity pools) requires a rare analytical skill set. The 34% adoption moment means demand for this dual-domain capability is surging. I'm requesting a 30% illiquidity premium on the options grant to reflect this scarcity."

**Lever 3 — Revenue Impact at Scale:**
> "At Rapyd's transaction volume across 900+ payment methods, a single routing optimization based on my models could save millions annually. A fraud detection improvement of 0.5% translates directly to reduced chargebacks and regulatory risk. The Institutional-Grade Execution mandate means my models must be accurate enough for enterprise customers to trust. My bonus should be 18% of base tied to model-driven revenue impact."

**Lever 4 — Illiquidity Premium for Analytics Talent:**
> "Data scientists at Google and Meta earn $350K–$450K in liquid total comp at the senior level. Rapyd's illiquid options require me to bet on the stablecoin thesis. I need the grant sized at a 30% premium over comparable liquid equity, plus a $20,000 signing bonus to bridge the first-year gap."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target total comp of $325K–$370K in SF (£98K–£112K base London, ₪490K–₪550K base Tel Aviv). Anchor base at $192K–$215K in SF. Push for a 30% illiquidity premium on options — target $125K–$155K annualized. Request a $20,000 signing bonus. Frame every ask around the Stablecoin Mainstream analytics challenge, 34% adoption, and Institutional-Grade Execution modeling. Accept-at floor: $178K base / $102K options annualized in SF-equivalent terms — below this, Google and Stripe DS offers with liquid equity are clearly superior.
