### Security Engineer — Rapyd Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Rapyd's Stablecoin Mainstream strategy, translating the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report (34% business adoption) into a Security Engineer compensation framework spanning London, Tel Aviv, and San Francisco markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £78,000–£118,000 | £48,000–£95,000 | £126,000–£213,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪405,000–₪590,000 | ₪240,000–₪460,000 | ₪645,000–₪1,050,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $158,000–$225,000 | $82,000–$160,000 | $240,000–$385,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Security Engineer at Rapyd protects a fintech-as-a-service platform that handles real money movement across 900+ payment methods in 100+ countries. With the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report showing 34% business adoption, the security landscape has expanded from traditional payment security (PCI-DSS, API security, fraud prevention) into a dual-domain challenge: securing both fiat payment infrastructure AND stablecoin settlement systems simultaneously. The Institutional-Grade Execution mandate means Rapyd's stablecoin infrastructure must meet the same security standards that enterprise customers expect from traditional banking — plus the blockchain-specific security challenges of smart contract vulnerabilities, private key management, bridge exploits, and on-chain transaction monitoring. A security failure in the stablecoin settlement context could mean irrecoverable loss of funds, not just a data breach. This existential risk profile, combined with the extreme scarcity of security engineers who understand both payment security and blockchain security, gives you exceptional negotiation leverage.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Rapyd | Checkout.com | Airwallex | Nium | Stripe | Adyen |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer |
| Senior Security Engineer | Senior SecEng | Senior SecEng | Senior SecEng | Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Engineer |

Checkout.com Security Engineers in London see £85K–£125K base with growth equity. Stripe Security Engineers in SF command $165K–$230K with liquid RSUs. Airwallex and Nium offer comparable base with different equity structures. Additionally, crypto-native companies (Chainalysis, Fireblocks) compete aggressively for security talent with blockchain expertise. Rapyd must differentiate on the Institutional-Grade Execution narrative.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report — 34% business adoption — dramatically expands the Security Engineer's mandate at Rapyd. Stablecoin settlement introduces an entirely new attack surface: smart contract vulnerabilities, private key management for institutional wallets, bridge security between fiat and stablecoin settlement layers, on-chain transaction monitoring for AML/CFT, and novel fraud vectors like flash loan attacks and MEV exploitation at the settlement layer.

The Institutional-Grade Execution mandate means you are not just securing systems — you are building the security architecture that enables enterprise customers to trust Rapyd with stablecoin settlement. Enterprise security teams will audit Rapyd's stablecoin infrastructure before approving integration. The security posture you build is a sales enabler, not just a risk mitigator.

The 34% adoption figure means this is not theoretical threat modeling — it is production security for systems that enterprise customers are evaluating today. The security engineer who builds the institutional-grade security framework for mainstream stablecoin settlement defines a new discipline. Your negotiation leverage: you are protecting against existential risk (irrecoverable fund loss) in a domain where the talent pool is measured in hundreds, not thousands.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Stablecoin Security Architecture:**
> "The Jan 2026 Stablecoins Report shows 34% business adoption. Rapyd's Institutional-Grade Execution infrastructure introduces security challenges that don't exist in traditional payments: smart contract auditing, private key management for institutional wallets, bridge security, and on-chain monitoring. A single vulnerability could mean irrecoverable fund loss. This existential risk mandate justifies a base of $215K in SF with options at $150K annualized."

**Lever 2 — Dual-Domain Security Scarcity:**
> "Security engineers who understand both PCI-DSS payment security AND blockchain/smart contract security are among the rarest profiles in the industry. The 34% adoption moment means every fintech is hiring for this intersection. I'm requesting a 30% illiquidity premium on the options grant to reflect this scarcity and offset Rapyd's private equity risk."

**Lever 3 — Institutional-Grade Compliance Security:**
> "Stablecoins at 34% mainstream adoption means regulators are implementing comprehensive security frameworks. I must build security systems that satisfy PCI-DSS, MiCA crypto-asset security requirements, SEC custody rules, and emerging FinCEN stablecoin regulations — simultaneously. This multi-framework compliance security capability is what enables Institutional-Grade Execution. It commands a premium."

**Lever 4 — Security as Sales Enabler:**
> "Enterprise customers will audit Rapyd's stablecoin security posture before integrating. The security architecture I build directly enables revenue — a robust security framework accelerates enterprise deal cycles. This revenue-enabling dimension justifies a signing bonus of $22,000 and performance bonus tied to enterprise security certification milestones."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target total comp of $340K–$385K in SF (£105K–£118K base London, ₪540K–₪590K base Tel Aviv). Anchor base at $198K–$225K in SF. Push for 30% illiquidity premium on options — target $125K–$160K annualized. Request a $22,000 signing bonus. Frame every ask around the Stablecoin Mainstream security challenge, 34% adoption, and Institutional-Grade Execution existential risk mandate. Accept-at floor: $185K base / $105K options annualized in SF-equivalent terms — below this, security roles at banks, Stripe, or crypto-native companies with liquid comp are better options.
