### Product Designer — Rapyd Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Rapyd's Stablecoin Mainstream strategy, translating the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report (34% business adoption) into a Product Designer compensation framework spanning London, Tel Aviv, and San Francisco markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £62,000–£98,000 | £30,000–£68,000 | £92,000–£166,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪310,000–₪490,000 | ₪155,000–₪340,000 | ₪465,000–₪830,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $132,000–$188,000 | $55,000–$125,000 | $187,000–$313,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Product Designer at Rapyd shapes the experience layer of a fintech-as-a-service platform that powers 900+ payment methods across 100+ countries. With the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report showing 34% business adoption, your role expands from traditional B2B fintech design into designing Institutional-Grade Execution interfaces for stablecoin settlement — dashboards, monitoring tools, compliance visualizations, and integration flows that enterprise treasury teams and regulated financial institutions will trust with their stablecoin settlement operations. Unlike consumer-facing design roles, your primary users are developers, merchants, and finance professionals who interact with Rapyd through APIs, dashboards, and integration flows. The quality of your design directly impacts merchant onboarding speed, API adoption rates, and operational efficiency — all critical metrics as Rapyd pivots to stablecoin settlement. Designers who understand both B2B fintech UX and the emerging design challenges of Institutional-Grade stablecoin infrastructure are exceptionally rare.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Rapyd | Checkout.com | Airwallex | Nium | Stripe | Adyen |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Product Designer | Product Designer | Product Designer | Product Designer | Product Designer | Product Designer |
| Senior Product Designer | Senior Designer | Senior Designer | Senior Designer | Senior Product Designer | Senior Product Designer |

Stripe and Square invest heavily in design and offer liquid equity. Checkout.com designers in London see £70K–£100K base with growth equity. Airwallex offers comparable packages. Rapyd must compensate for its illiquidity with either larger grants or higher base, especially as the Stablecoin Mainstream pivot creates greenfield design challenges that attract top talent.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report changes the design challenge at Rapyd fundamentally. With 34% of businesses now using stablecoins, the platform must serve users who are navigating both traditional fiat payments and stablecoin settlement flows. The Institutional-Grade Execution mandate means these interfaces must meet the trust, clarity, and compliance standards that enterprise finance teams demand — not the experimental crypto-native UX patterns that early stablecoin adopters tolerated.

For Product Designers, this creates a greenfield opportunity: designing the interfaces that make stablecoin settlement as intuitive as fiat payments for merchants who may have never interacted with blockchain-based systems. Settlement dashboards, stablecoin flow visualizations, compliance monitoring tools, hybrid fiat-stablecoin transaction histories — none of these have established design patterns. You are creating the design language for Institutional-Grade stablecoin infrastructure.

The 34% adoption figure is your negotiation anchor: it proves that these interfaces are not speculative concepts — they are urgently needed products that enterprise customers are waiting for. The designer who establishes the UX patterns for mainstream stablecoin settlement will define a new design discipline.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Stablecoin UX Pioneer Premium:**
> "The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report shows 34% business adoption — yet no fintech has established the design patterns for Institutional-Grade stablecoin settlement interfaces. I'll be designing the UX that makes stablecoin settlement intuitive for enterprise treasury teams who have never used blockchain. This is greenfield design with no precedent. My base should reflect this pioneering scope: $180K in SF."

**Lever 2 — Institutional-Grade Trust Design:**
> "Institutional-Grade Execution means the interfaces I design must convey trust, compliance, and reliability to enterprise customers evaluating stablecoin settlement. This is a fundamentally different design challenge from consumer fintech — one mistake in the settlement dashboard and an enterprise customer loses confidence. This trust design premium justifies options at $115K annualized."

**Lever 3 — Developer Experience ROI:**
> "Rapyd's platform serves developers who integrate 900+ payment methods and now stablecoin settlement. The developer experience I design — API docs, integration guides, sandbox flows — directly determines onboarding velocity. At Rapyd's scale across 100+ countries, a 10% improvement in onboarding conversion is worth millions. My compensation should reflect this revenue leverage."

**Lever 4 — Illiquidity Offset for Design Talent:**
> "I have offers from Stripe and Square where I would receive liquid equity. Rapyd's options cannot be sold on the open market. To accept the illiquidity risk, I need either a 25% larger options grant or a $15,000–$20,000 signing bonus to bridge the first-year comp gap."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target total comp of $260K–$313K in SF (£85K–£98K base London, ₪430K–₪490K base Tel Aviv). Anchor base at $168K–$188K in SF. Push for a 25% premium on the options grant. Request a $15,000–$20,000 signing bonus. Frame every ask around the Stablecoin Mainstream design challenge, 34% adoption, and Institutional-Grade Execution UX pioneering. Accept-at floor: $150K base / $72K options annualized in SF-equivalent terms — below this, Stripe and Square offers with liquid equity are clearly superior.
