### Engineering Manager — Rapyd Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Rapyd's Stablecoin Mainstream strategy, translating the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report (34% business adoption) into an Engineering Manager compensation framework spanning London, Tel Aviv, and San Francisco markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £95,000–£135,000 | £70,000–£130,000 | £165,000–£265,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪480,000–₪680,000 | ₪340,000–₪630,000 | ₪820,000–₪1,310,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $190,000–$255,000 | $120,000–$210,000 | $310,000–$465,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Engineering Manager at Rapyd is responsible for the most critical multiplier in the company's Stablecoin Mainstream execution: the productivity, retention, and strategic alignment of entire engineering teams. With the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report showing 34% business adoption, Rapyd's pivot to Institutional-Grade Execution infrastructure requires EMs who can hire, develop, and retain engineers at the intersection of traditional payments and stablecoin settlement — one of the tightest talent markets in fintech. You are not just managing a team; you are building the organizational capability that determines whether Rapyd ships Institutional-Grade stablecoin infrastructure faster than Checkout.com, Stripe, or Adyen. Your ability to recruit engineers who understand both payment orchestration and crypto settlement, and to create the technical culture where they do their best work, is the bottleneck for Rapyd's strategic execution.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Rapyd | Checkout.com | Airwallex | Nium | Stripe | Adyen |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | EM (M1) | Engineering Manager |
| Senior Engineering Manager | Senior EM | Senior EM | Director of Engineering | EM (M2) | Senior Engineering Manager |

Checkout.com EMs in London command £110K–£145K base with growth equity. Stripe EMs (M1) in SF see $200K–$260K base with pre-IPO RSUs. Airwallex offers comparable base with Singapore-weighted options. Nium benchmarks similarly at the EM level. Rapyd must match or exceed base to compete for management talent, especially given the illiquidity of options in a private company.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report's 34% business adoption figure transforms the Engineering Manager role at Rapyd. The Stablecoin Mainstream moment means Rapyd must rapidly scale teams that can build Institutional-Grade Execution infrastructure — systems that satisfy enterprise compliance requirements while leveraging stablecoin settlement advantages. This is a hiring, retention, and execution challenge that falls squarely on the EM.

Engineering Managers are the force multiplier for Rapyd's stablecoin pivot. You set the hiring bar for engineers who can build compliant stablecoin settlement systems. You create the technical processes that ensure Institutional-Grade quality. You retain the scarce engineers who understand both traditional payment rails and blockchain-based settlement. The 34% adoption figure means the demand for these engineers is surging across the entire fintech industry, and your ability to build and keep a world-class team is directly tied to Rapyd's competitive position.

The Institutional-Grade Execution mandate raises the bar for engineering management: you must build teams that ship with the speed of a startup but the compliance rigor of a regulated financial institution. This dual mandate — velocity plus institutional grade — is what makes the Rapyd EM role more demanding (and more valuable) than comparable roles at pure-play payments or pure-play crypto companies.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Stablecoin Talent Acquisition Premium:**
> "The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report showing 34% business adoption has created a surge in demand for engineers who can build Institutional-Grade stablecoin infrastructure. As the EM responsible for hiring this talent, I'm competing against Stripe, Circle, Paxos, and every major fintech for the same scarce pool. My comp must signal that Rapyd values engineering leadership — I need base at $245K+ in SF to attract and retain top talent credibly."

**Lever 2 — Team Retention as Strategic Asset:**
> "In a market where stablecoin infrastructure engineers command 20-30% premiums, keeping my team intact is a strategic imperative. An EM who loses key engineers during the Institutional-Grade Execution buildout costs Rapyd far more than paying a competitive management package. I'm requesting options at the 80th percentile to align my retention incentives with the company's stablecoin timeline."

**Lever 3 — Dual-Mandate Complexity:**
> "Rapyd's Stablecoin Mainstream pivot requires shipping with startup velocity while maintaining institutional-grade compliance rigor. Managing this dual mandate — across three geographies (London, Tel Aviv, SF) — is more complex than managing at a pure payments or pure crypto company. This complexity premium justifies base salary at the top of band and a 25% increase on the options grant."

**Lever 4 — Illiquidity Risk for Management Talent:**
> "Engineering managers have liquid-equity alternatives at Adyen, Google, Meta, and Amazon — all companies where my equity vests into immediately tradable stock. Rapyd's illiquid options require a meaningful offset: either a 30% larger grant or a signing bonus of $40K+ to bridge the year-one liquidity gap."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Anchor base salary at $235K–$255K in SF (£120K–£135K London, ₪620K–₪680K Tel Aviv). Push options grant to the 80th percentile — target $180K–$210K annualized. Request a $30,000–$45,000 signing bonus to offset the illiquidity gap vs. public-company EM offers. Frame every ask around the Stablecoin Mainstream talent challenge and the 34% adoption data point from the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report. Accept-at floor: $220K base / $145K options annualized / $25K signing bonus in SF-equivalent terms — below this, the package falls below Checkout.com and Stripe EM offers.
