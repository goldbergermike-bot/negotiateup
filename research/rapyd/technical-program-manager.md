### Technical Program Manager — Rapyd Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Rapyd's Stablecoin Mainstream strategy, translating the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report (34% business adoption) into a Technical Program Manager compensation framework spanning London, Tel Aviv, and San Francisco markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £78,000–£118,000 | £48,000–£95,000 | £126,000–£213,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪405,000–₪590,000 | ₪240,000–₪460,000 | ₪645,000–₪1,050,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $158,000–$225,000 | $88,000–$160,000 | $246,000–$385,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Technical Program Manager at Rapyd is the central nervous system for cross-functional execution in one of the most complex fintech platforms in the world. With the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report showing 34% business adoption, the TPM role has become mission-critical: you are orchestrating the most ambitious program in Rapyd's history — building Institutional-Grade Execution infrastructure for stablecoin settlement while simultaneously maintaining and optimizing the existing payment platform across 900+ methods in 100+ countries. This is not a single project — it is a portfolio of interdependent programs with regulatory dependencies across multiple jurisdictions, infrastructure prerequisites, market-launch sequencing, and the added complexity of blockchain infrastructure timelines. You coordinate engineering, product, compliance, and operations teams across London, Tel Aviv, and global offices. The stablecoin pivot adds regulatory coordination across MiCA, SEC/FinCEN, and emerging frameworks — dependencies that can delay launches by months if not managed precisely. TPMs with fintech infrastructure experience who also understand blockchain program dynamics are heavily recruited by Stripe, Google, and Amazon.

Checkout.com TPMs in London see £85K–£125K base with growth equity. Stripe TPMs in SF command $165K–$230K base with liquid RSUs. Google TPgMs (L5-L6) offer $300K+ total comp with fully liquid equity. Rapyd must offset illiquidity with the Stablecoin Mainstream upside narrative and competitive base.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report — 34% business adoption — creates the most complex program management challenge in Rapyd's history. Building Institutional-Grade Execution infrastructure for stablecoin settlement requires coordinating across engineering (traditional payments + blockchain), compliance (MiCA, SEC, FinCEN, local regulators in 40+ markets), product (new stablecoin settlement products), and operations (enterprise customer onboarding to stablecoin rails).

The TPM is the person who ensures all of these workstreams converge on a coherent timeline. The regulatory dependency chain alone — getting stablecoin settlement approval in each market before engineering can build market-specific features — requires program management sophistication that most TPMs have never encountered. Add to this the blockchain-specific timing considerations (testnet vs. mainnet deployments, smart contract audit cycles, bridge security reviews) and you have a program that is qualitatively different from traditional fintech delivery.

The 34% adoption figure proves urgency: businesses are already using stablecoins and are waiting for enterprise-grade settlement infrastructure. Every month of program delay is a month where Checkout.com, Stripe, or Circle could capture this market. Your ability to ship the Institutional-Grade Execution program on time is directly tied to Rapyd's competitive position.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Stablecoin Program Leadership:**
> "The Stablecoin Mainstream initiative — driven by the Jan 2026 Stablecoins Report showing 34% business adoption — is Rapyd's highest-priority, most complex program. I will own the cross-functional delivery of Institutional-Grade Execution infrastructure spanning engineering, compliance, product, and operations across three geographies. This program scope justifies base at the top of band: $220K in SF."

**Lever 2 — Regulatory Dependency Coordination:**
> "The Institutional-Grade Execution program requires coordinating across multiple regulatory regimes — MiCA in Europe, SEC/FinCEN in the US, and local frameworks in 40+ markets. Managing this regulatory dependency chain, where a single delayed approval can cascade across the entire program, is unique to Rapyd's multi-country stablecoin deployment. This complexity premium justifies a 20% increase on the options grant."

**Lever 3 — Blockchain Program Dynamics:**
> "Building stablecoin settlement infrastructure introduces program dependencies that don't exist in traditional fintech: smart contract audit cycles, testnet-to-mainnet deployment sequencing, bridge security reviews, and blockchain-specific release management. I bring experience managing programs at the intersection of traditional infrastructure and blockchain deployment. This dual-domain TPM expertise is exceptionally rare."

**Lever 4 — Illiquidity Offset for Program Leadership:**
> "TPMs at Google, Stripe, and Amazon receive liquid equity in well-established TPM career ladders. Rapyd's illiquid options and the additional complexity of the Stablecoin Mainstream program require a $22,000 signing bonus and explicit secondary sale provisions after 24 months to make the package competitive."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target total comp of $345K–$385K in SF (£105K–£118K base London, ₪540K–₪590K base Tel Aviv). Anchor base at $202K–$225K in SF. Push options to 20% above initial offer — target $130K–$160K annualized. Request a $22,000 signing bonus. Frame every ask around the Stablecoin Mainstream program complexity, 34% adoption urgency, and Institutional-Grade Execution delivery accountability. Accept-at floor: $188K base / $108K options annualized in SF-equivalent terms — below this, Google TPgM and Stripe TPM offers with liquid equity are clearly superior.
