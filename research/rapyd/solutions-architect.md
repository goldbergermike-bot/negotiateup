#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £82,000–£122,000 | £48,000–£95,000 | £130,000–£217,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪425,000–₪610,000 | ₪235,000–₪460,000 | ₪660,000–₪1,070,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $158,000–$218,000 | $82,000–$160,000 | $240,000–$378,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Solutions Architect at Rapyd is the technical bridge between the platform's capabilities and enterprise merchant needs — the person who translates Rapyd's 900+ payment methods, local acquiring in 40+ markets, and now stablecoin settlement infrastructure into concrete integration architectures for enterprise clients. With the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report showing 34% business adoption, your role expands into designing solutions that incorporate Institutional-Grade Execution of stablecoin settlement — helping enterprise merchants understand how stablecoin-powered settlement can reduce their settlement times from T+2 to near-instantaneous while lowering FX costs. Every solution you design either wins or loses a six- to seven-figure annual contract, making you a direct revenue driver. Solutions Architects who understand global payments at the depth required by Rapyd — interchange structures, local settlement rules, multi-currency treasury flows — AND can articulate the stablecoin settlement value proposition to enterprise procurement teams are among the rarest profiles in fintech.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Rapyd | Checkout.com | Airwallex | Nium | Stripe | Adyen |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Solutions Architect | Solutions Engineer | Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect |
| Senior Solutions Architect | Senior SE | Senior SA | Senior SA | Senior Solutions Architect | Senior Solutions Architect |

Checkout.com SAs in London command £90K–£130K base with growth equity plus deal-influence bonuses. Stripe Solutions Architects in SF see $165K–$225K base with liquid RSUs. Airwallex and Nium offer comparable packages. Rapyd must differentiate on the Stablecoin Mainstream opportunity and competitive base to attract SAs who could join competitors with more liquid equity structures.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report — 34% business adoption — transforms the Solutions Architect role at Rapyd from traditional payment integration design to designing Institutional-Grade Execution architectures that incorporate stablecoin settlement alongside fiat payment rails.

Enterprise merchants are now asking: "Can we settle in stablecoins?" The SA must have credible, technical answers that address settlement speed, cost savings, compliance requirements, and integration complexity. You are the person who makes stablecoin settlement real for enterprise customers — translating Rapyd's Institutional-Grade Execution infrastructure into business proposals that enterprise treasurers and CTOs can evaluate and approve.

The 34% adoption figure is your most powerful tool in customer-facing conversations and in your own compensation negotiation. It proves that stablecoin settlement is not a niche offering — it is a mainstream enterprise requirement. The SA who can design and sell hybrid fiat-stablecoin settlement architectures is driving the next wave of Rapyd's revenue growth. This direct revenue attribution, combined with the scarcity of SAs who can operate credibly across both payment and stablecoin domains, justifies premium compensation.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Stablecoin Solution Design Premium:**
> "The Jan 2026 Stablecoins Report shows 34% business adoption. Enterprise merchants are actively asking for stablecoin settlement options. I'll be designing the Institutional-Grade Execution architectures that win these deals — solutions that bridge Rapyd's traditional payment rails with stablecoin settlement. This dual-domain SA expertise is scarce and directly revenue-generating. My base should reflect this: $210K minimum in SF."

**Lever 2 — Revenue Attribution for Stablecoin Deals:**
> "Every enterprise deal I design and close on stablecoin settlement directly validates Rapyd's Institutional-Grade Execution strategy and drives revenue. If I close three enterprise merchants on stablecoin settlement in year one, that could represent $5M–$15M in ARR. My options grant should reflect this direct revenue attribution: $150K annualized, with performance accelerators tied to stablecoin deal volume."

**Lever 3 — Multi-Market Regulatory Architecture:**
> "Designing payment solutions — including stablecoin settlement — that work across 100+ countries means understanding the regulatory landscape in every market. The 34% adoption figure means regulators are actively building stablecoin frameworks. I must architect solutions that satisfy both current fiat regulations and emerging stablecoin compliance requirements. This regulatory architecture knowledge commands a premium."

**Lever 4 — Illiquidity Offset with Revenue Contribution:**
> "I have offers from Stripe and Adyen where I would receive liquid equity. As an SA, my revenue contribution is directly measurable. To accept Rapyd's illiquid options, I need a $25,000 signing bonus and a deal-influence bonus structure that provides liquid upside beyond the illiquid equity component."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target total comp of $340K–$378K in SF (£108K–£122K base London, ₪560K–₪610K base Tel Aviv). Anchor base at $198K–$218K in SF. Push options to $130K–$160K annualized with deal-influence bonus overlay. Request a $25,000 signing bonus. Frame every ask around the Stablecoin Mainstream sales opportunity, 34% adoption, and Institutional-Grade Execution solution design. Accept-at floor: $182K base / $105K options annualized in SF-equivalent terms — below this, Stripe and Adyen SA offers with liquid equity and deal bonuses are superior.
