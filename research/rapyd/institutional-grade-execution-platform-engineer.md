#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £120,000–£165,000 | £100,000–£185,000 | £220,000–£350,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪600,000–₪820,000 | ₪480,000–₪880,000 | ₪1,080,000–₪1,700,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $230,000–$305,000 | $170,000–$290,000 | $400,000–$595,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Institutional-Grade Execution Platform Engineer is the defining technical role for Rapyd's next era. This is not a standard staff or principal engineering position — it is the architect and builder of the core platform that will power stablecoin settlement at enterprise scale across 100+ countries. The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report showed 34% business adoption of stablecoins, confirming that what was once a crypto-native experiment is now mainstream business infrastructure. Rapyd, with its existing payment orchestration layer spanning 900+ payment methods and local acquiring in 40+ markets, is uniquely positioned to become the Institutional-Grade Execution platform for this new financial paradigm — but only if someone builds it.

That someone is you.

This role sits at the apex of Rapyd's technical hierarchy for the stablecoin pivot. You are responsible for the end-to-end platform architecture that enables enterprise customers — multinational corporations, regulated financial institutions, enterprise treasury operations — to settle transactions in stablecoins with the same confidence, compliance, and reliability they expect from traditional banking rails. You are building the bridge between the $2T+ global payments market and the rapidly mainstreaming stablecoin economy. Every design decision you make — from the settlement engine architecture to the compliance framework integration, from the multi-chain abstraction layer to the hybrid fiat-stablecoin routing engine — will either enable or constrain Rapyd's ability to capture the institutional stablecoin opportunity for the next decade.

The negotiation dynamics for this role are unlike any other at Rapyd. You are being recruited from an extraordinarily small talent pool: engineers who have built production-grade payment settlement infrastructure AND who understand blockchain architecture, smart contract security, stablecoin economics, and institutional compliance requirements. The companies competing for you include Stripe (building their own crypto settlement layer), Circle (stablecoin-native but needing payments expertise), Paxos (institutional stablecoin infrastructure), Fireblocks (digital asset operations), Checkout.com (payment orchestration with crypto ambitions), and the internal crypto/blockchain teams at JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Visa. Every one of these competitors offers either liquid equity (public companies), token-based compensation (crypto-native), or later-stage private equity with secondary market access. Rapyd's fully illiquid options require a substantial premium — in grant size, base salary, or both — to be competitive.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Rapyd | Checkout.com | Airwallex | Nium | Stripe | Adyen |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Institutional-Grade Execution Platform Engineer | Staff/Principal Engineer | Staff/Principal Engineer | Principal/Distinguished | L3-L4 | Staff/Principal Engineer |

This SIGNATURE ROLE maps to the top of the Staff to low-Principal band across the industry. At Stripe, the equivalent role (L3 building crypto settlement infrastructure) commands $300K–$350K base with $250K+ annualized RSUs that have secondary market access. At Circle, the equivalent platform architect sees $280K–$330K base with token-based compensation that can be partially liquidated. At Checkout.com, Staff Engineers in London earn £140K–£170K base with growth equity. Fireblocks platform architects command $270K–$320K base with pre-IPO equity.

The critical differentiator: none of these companies sit at the intersection of 900+ payment methods, 100+ country footprint, local acquiring in 40+ markets, AND stablecoin settlement infrastructure. The Institutional-Grade Execution Platform Engineer at Rapyd is building something that no competitor can replicate without years of investment in the underlying payment orchestration layer.

#### Extended Level Benchmarking — SIGNATURE ROLE Deep Dive

The uniqueness of this role warrants deeper competitive analysis:

**Stripe (L3-L4, Crypto Infrastructure)**: Stripe's crypto settlement team builds on top of their existing payment infrastructure. Their L3 engineers see $250K–$310K base, $200K–$280K annualized RSUs (with secondary market access via Forge, EquityZen), and $40K–$60K bonus. Total comp: $490K–$650K. However, Stripe's crypto infrastructure is a team within a larger company — the engineer doesn't own the end-to-end Institutional-Grade Execution mandate.

**Circle (Principal Platform Architect)**: Circle's platform architects define the infrastructure that powers USDC — the second-largest stablecoin. Comp: $280K–$330K base, token grants valued at $150K–$250K annualized with partial liquidity. Total comp: $430K–$580K. Circle has stablecoin depth but lacks Rapyd's multi-country payment orchestration layer.

**Fireblocks (Platform Architect)**: Fireblocks builds digital asset operations infrastructure for institutional customers. Platform architects see $270K–$320K base with pre-IPO options valued at $140K–$220K annualized. Total comp: $410K–$540K. Fireblocks has institutional crypto expertise but doesn't process fiat payments.

**Paxos (Senior/Staff Platform Engineer)**: Paxos builds regulated stablecoin infrastructure. Engineers at this level see $250K–$300K base with equity grants valued at $120K–$200K annualized. Total comp: $370K–$500K. Paxos is regulated stablecoin-native but doesn't have a multi-country payment orchestration layer.

**JPMorgan / Goldman Sachs (VP/ED, Blockchain Platform)**: Traditional banks building internal blockchain settlement platforms. VP-level engineers see $250K–$320K base with $150K–$250K cash bonus. Total comp: $400K–$570K with fully liquid compensation.

Rapyd's SIGNATURE ROLE must compete against all of these — and the illiquidity of Rapyd options means the total package must exceed the midpoint of this competitive set on a pre-liquidity basis.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

##### The Watershed Moment: 34% Business Adoption

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report is not just another industry report — it is the data point that validates Rapyd's entire stablecoin strategy and justifies this SIGNATURE ROLE's existence. When 34% of businesses report actively using stablecoins for payments, treasury, or settlement, the technology has crossed from niche to mainstream. This is the moment when institutional infrastructure must be built — not experimental prototypes, not proof-of-concepts, but production-grade, enterprise-ready, compliance-certified Institutional-Grade Execution infrastructure.

For the Institutional-Grade Execution Platform Engineer, the 34% figure means:

1. **The market is real and waiting**: Enterprise customers are not asking "should we use stablecoins?" — they are asking "which platform can we trust to settle in stablecoins?" Rapyd's answer to this question depends on the platform you build.

2. **Regulatory frameworks are solidifying**: 34% adoption has forced regulators to move from speculation to rulemaking. MiCA in Europe, evolving SEC/FinCEN guidance in the US, MAS frameworks in Singapore, and dozens of other jurisdictions are building comprehensive stablecoin regulations. The platform you design must satisfy all of them — not just today's rules, but tomorrow's.

3. **The competition window is closing**: Every major fintech, bank, and crypto company is building stablecoin settlement infrastructure. The 12-18 month window where Rapyd's existing multi-country payment orchestration layer gives it a structural advantage will not last forever. The speed at which you build the Institutional-Grade Execution platform determines whether Rapyd captures or cedes this market.

4. **Enterprise procurement is ready**: At 34% adoption, enterprise procurement teams have processes for evaluating stablecoin infrastructure. They want SOC 2 Type II certifications, PCI-DSS compliance, regulatory licenses, SLA guarantees, and the same vendor management rigor they apply to traditional payment processors. The platform you build must meet these institutional standards from day one.

##### What "Institutional-Grade Execution" Means in Practice

This is not a marketing term — it is an engineering specification. Institutional-Grade Execution means:

- **Settlement finality guarantees**: Enterprise customers need to know that when a stablecoin settlement is confirmed, it is irrevocable. This requires building on top of chains with strong finality properties, implementing confirmation depth policies, and providing settlement guarantees backed by insurance or reserves.

- **Multi-chain abstraction**: The stablecoin ecosystem spans Ethereum, Solana, Tron, Polygon, Avalanche, and emerging chains. Enterprise customers should not need to choose a chain — the platform should abstract this complexity and route to the optimal chain for cost, speed, and finality.

- **Regulatory compliance engine**: Real-time AML/CFT screening on stablecoin transactions, travel rule compliance, sanctions screening, and jurisdiction-specific reporting — all integrated into the settlement flow, not bolted on.

- **Hybrid settlement orchestration**: A single enterprise customer may want to settle 60% in fiat and 40% in stablecoins, varying by corridor, transaction size, and time of day. The platform must orchestrate this hybrid settlement in real time.

- **Institutional custody integration**: Enterprise treasury teams need their stablecoin balances held in institutional-grade custody (Fireblocks, Anchorage, BitGo) with multi-sig, governance policies, and audit trails.

- **Enterprise-grade observability**: Real-time dashboards showing settlement status, blockchain confirmations, compliance checks, and cost analytics — at the level of detail that an enterprise treasury team requires for their own reporting.

The engineer who designs and builds this platform is creating something that does not exist today at Rapyd's scale and multi-country footprint. This is the defining engineering challenge in fintech in 2026.

##### Strategic Positioning for Negotiation

The Stablecoin Mainstream moment, validated by 34% business adoption, gives the Institutional-Grade Execution Platform Engineer uniquely powerful negotiation leverage:

- **You are building the company's future**: This is not a team within Rapyd — this is the platform that Rapyd is betting its next decade on. The stablecoin settlement infrastructure you build will either validate or invalidate Rapyd's strategic thesis.

- **The talent pool is measured in dozens, not thousands**: Engineers who have built production-grade payment settlement infrastructure at multi-country scale AND who understand blockchain architecture, stablecoin economics, and institutional compliance are extraordinarily rare. Rapyd cannot easily replace you if negotiations fail.

- **The opportunity cost is real and liquid**: Every competitor for your talent offers either liquid equity, token-based compensation with partial liquidity, or cash-heavy packages at traditional banks. Rapyd must compensate for illiquidity with outsized option grants and premium base salary.

- **The timeline is urgent**: With 34% adoption and competitors building, Rapyd cannot afford a six-month search for this role. Your willingness to commit now has time value.

#### Global Levers — SIGNATURE ROLE Extended

**Lever 1 — Platform Architecture Ownership for Stablecoin Mainstream:**
> "This SIGNATURE ROLE is the defining technical position for Rapyd's stablecoin pivot. The Jan 2026 Stablecoins Report confirms 34% business adoption — the market is real and urgent. I will architect the end-to-end Institutional-Grade Execution platform: settlement engine, multi-chain abstraction, compliance integration, hybrid fiat-stablecoin routing, and enterprise custody orchestration. This is the platform Rapyd is betting its next decade on. My compensation must reflect this: $295K+ base in SF with options at the 95th percentile of the band — $270K+ annualized. No comparable role at any competitor offers the combination of multi-country payment orchestration AND stablecoin settlement architecture ownership."

**Lever 2 — Illiquidity Premium at Apex Technical Level:**
> "At this level, my competing offers are from Stripe L3-L4 ($490K-$650K liquid TC), Circle Principal Architect ($430K-$580K with partial token liquidity), JPMorgan VP ($400K-$570K fully liquid), and Fireblocks Platform Architect ($410K-$540K). Rapyd's fully illiquid options require a minimum 40% premium over the median of these liquid/semi-liquid alternatives. That means total comp at $550K+ — $295K base, $270K options annualized — with a $50,000-$60,000 signing bonus to bridge year-one liquidity."

**Lever 3 — Dual-Domain Scarcity at Institutional Grade:**
> "The intersection of production payment settlement engineering (multi-country, multi-currency, regulatory-grade) AND blockchain architecture for stablecoin settlement is the scarcest talent profile in fintech. The 34% adoption figure means every major fintech, bank, and crypto company is hiring for this intersection simultaneously. I bring both domains at the level required for Institutional-Grade Execution. This scarcity premium justifies positioning at the absolute top of Rapyd's compensation bands."

**Lever 4 — Regulatory Architecture Across 100+ Jurisdictions:**
> "Building stablecoin settlement infrastructure that satisfies regulatory frameworks across 100+ countries — MiCA in Europe, SEC/FinCEN in the US, MAS in Singapore, JFSA in Japan, and dozens more — requires deep understanding of both payment regulation and emerging crypto-asset frameworks. I architect compliance into the platform from the foundation, not as an afterthought. This regulatory architecture capability is what makes the difference between a platform that enterprise customers will trust and one they won't. It justifies a 35% uplift on the standard options grant."

**Lever 5 — Multi-Chain Platform Engineering:**
> "Institutional-Grade Execution requires a multi-chain abstraction layer that routes stablecoin settlement across Ethereum, Solana, Tron, Polygon, Avalanche, and emerging chains based on cost, speed, and finality requirements. Building this abstraction at enterprise grade — with institutional custody integration, governance policies, and compliance checks at every step — is a platform engineering challenge that very few engineers in the world have tackled at production scale. My base should reflect this platform complexity premium."

**Lever 6 — Time-Value Premium:**
> "With 34% business adoption and competitors building stablecoin settlement infrastructure, every month that Rapyd delays the Institutional-Grade Execution platform is a month of lost competitive advantage. My willingness to commit now, rather than extending my search, has real time value. I'm asking for an accelerated vesting schedule — 25% at 12 months with monthly vesting thereafter — to align incentives with the urgency of the platform timeline."

**Lever 7 — Enterprise Revenue Enablement:**
> "The Institutional-Grade Execution platform I build directly enables enterprise revenue. Every enterprise customer that evaluates Rapyd's stablecoin settlement capability and signs based on the platform quality represents $1M-$10M+ in annual settlement volume. I am not a cost center — I am building the revenue engine. My compensation should include a performance bonus of 20% tied to platform launch milestones and enterprise customer adoption metrics."

**Lever 8 — Hybrid Settlement Innovation:**
> "Building a platform that orchestrates hybrid fiat-stablecoin settlement in real time — where a single enterprise customer can settle 60% in fiat and 40% in stablecoins, varying by corridor and transaction size — is an engineering challenge that no company has solved at Rapyd's 100+ country scale. This innovation premium, combined with the 34% adoption urgency and Institutional-Grade compliance requirements, justifies positioning this SIGNATURE ROLE at the top of the compensation range across all components."

#### SIGNATURE ROLE — Additional Strategic Negotiation Framework

##### The Three-Phase Negotiation Strategy

**Phase 1 — Establish the SIGNATURE ROLE Premium (Pre-Offer):**
Before numbers are discussed, establish that this role is qualitatively different from a standard Staff/Principal Engineer position. Use language like: "This role sits at the intersection of Rapyd's existing payment orchestration platform and the entire stablecoin settlement opportunity — validated by 34% business adoption. I want to make sure the compensation framework reflects the Institutional-Grade Execution mandate, not a standard engineering band."

**Phase 2 — Anchor on Competitive Set (Initial Offer Response):**
When the offer comes, anchor on the competitive set: "I'm comparing this against Stripe L3 crypto infrastructure ($490K-$650K liquid), Circle Principal Architect ($430K-$580K with token liquidity), and JPMorgan VP Blockchain ($400K-$570K fully liquid). Given Rapyd's illiquidity, I need the pre-liquidity package to exceed the median of this competitive set by at least 30%."

**Phase 3 — Close on Total Package Architecture (Final Negotiation):**
Structure the final ask across multiple components to give the hiring team flexibility: base salary ($295K-$305K), annualized options ($260K-$290K at 95th percentile), signing bonus ($50K-$60K), performance bonus (20% of base), accelerated vesting (25% at 12 months, monthly thereafter), and secondary sale access provision after 18 months. Be willing to trade between components — e.g., accept lower base for larger options grant if you have high conviction in the stablecoin thesis.

##### Accept/Walk Framework for SIGNATURE ROLE

| Component | Target | Accept-At | Walk-Away |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Base Salary (SF) | $295K–$305K | $270K | Below $260K |
| Options Annualized (SF) | $260K–$290K | $210K | Below $190K |
| Signing Bonus | $50K–$60K | $40K | Below $30K |
| Total Comp (SF) | $555K–$595K | $480K | Below $450K |
| Vesting Schedule | 25%/12mo + monthly | Standard 1yr cliff + monthly | 1yr cliff + annual |
| Secondary Sale Access | 18 months | 24 months | No provision |

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: This SIGNATURE ROLE demands compensation at the apex of Rapyd's engineering bands. Anchor total comp at $555K–$595K in SF ($295K–$305K base, $260K–$290K options annualized). In London, target £155K–£165K base with £170K–£185K annualized options. In Tel Aviv, target ₪770K–₪820K base with ₪820K–₪880K annualized options. Request a $50,000–$60,000 signing bonus, 20% performance bonus, accelerated vesting (25% at 12 months, monthly thereafter), and written secondary sale access after 18 months. Frame every negotiation point around three pillars: (1) the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report showing 34% business adoption proving the market is real, (2) the Institutional-Grade Execution mandate that defines this SIGNATURE ROLE, and (3) the competitive set of liquid/semi-liquid offers from Stripe, Circle, JPMorgan, and Fireblocks that establish the market-clearing price for this talent. Accept-at floor: $270K base / $210K options annualized / $40K signing bonus in SF-equivalent terms — below this, the illiquidity risk is not adequately compensated given the competitive set. Walk-away: below $260K base or $190K options annualized — at this level, the risk-adjusted comp is materially below every liquid alternative.
