#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £82,000–£122,000 | £50,000–£105,000 | £132,000–£227,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪420,000–₪610,000 | ₪260,000–₪500,000 | ₪680,000–₪1,110,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Product Manager at Rapyd sits at the nexus of payments complexity and platform strategy, defining the product roadmap for a fintech-as-a-service platform spanning 900+ payment methods across 100+ countries. With the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report revealing 34% business adoption, the PM role has expanded from traditional payment product management into defining entirely new product categories at the intersection of fiat payments and stablecoin settlement. You are responsible for shaping how Rapyd's Institutional-Grade Execution infrastructure reaches enterprise customers — which stablecoin settlement products to build, how to price them, which merchant segments to target first, and how to sequence the rollout across regulated markets. Every product decision you make directly impacts whether Rapyd captures or cedes the stablecoin settlement opportunity to competitors like Checkout.com, Stripe, or Circle. Product Managers who combine deep payments domain expertise with understanding of stablecoin economics and enterprise go-to-market are extremely scarce and command premium compensation.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Rapyd | Checkout.com | Airwallex | Nium | Stripe | Adyen |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Product Manager | Product Manager | Product Manager | Product Manager | PM | Product Manager |
| Senior Product Manager | Senior PM | Senior PM | Senior PM | Senior PM | Senior Product Manager |

Checkout.com PMs in London command £90K–£130K base with growth equity. Stripe PMs in SF see $170K–$240K base with pre-IPO RSUs that have secondary liquidity. Airwallex and Nium offer comparable base with different equity structures. Rapyd must differentiate on the Stablecoin Mainstream upside story to attract PMs who could join competitors with more liquid equity.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report is a watershed moment for product managers in fintech: 34% of businesses now use stablecoins, creating urgent demand for enterprise-grade settlement products. For Rapyd, this means the PM must define an entirely new product vertical — stablecoin settlement-as-a-service — built on top of the existing payment orchestration platform.

The Institutional-Grade Execution mandate transforms the PM role. You are not building products for crypto-native users who tolerate rough edges; you are building for enterprise treasury teams, multinational merchants, and regulated financial institutions that demand the same reliability, compliance, and support they expect from traditional banking rails. The 34% adoption figure proves the market is real and waiting — the PM who defines the right product strategy will drive billions in settlement volume.

This is a platform product management role at the most consequential inflection point in fintech. Stablecoins crossing into mainstream business adoption means the PM who gets this right builds a career-defining product category. The 34% adoption data point is your strongest negotiation lever — it proves that stablecoin products are not speculative, they are table stakes for any serious payments platform.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Stablecoin Product Category Creation:**
> "The Jan 2026 Stablecoins Report shows 34% business adoption. Rapyd needs a PM who can define the Institutional-Grade Execution product strategy — stablecoin settlement products that enterprise customers will trust. I'll be creating an entirely new product category, not iterating on existing features. This category-creation mandate justifies base at the top of band: $225K in SF, with options reflecting the revenue potential of the stablecoin settlement vertical."

**Lever 2 — Institutional-Grade Go-to-Market Strategy:**
> "Building stablecoin products for 34% of businesses that already use stablecoins requires a PM who understands both the crypto-native demand patterns AND enterprise procurement requirements. I bring this dual lens. The Institutional-Grade Execution positioning demands a PM who can navigate compliance, pricing, and channel strategy simultaneously. This strategic scope justifies options at $160K annualized."

**Lever 3 — Portfolio Rationalization for Stablecoin Focus:**
> "Rapyd's Stablecoin Mainstream pivot means ruthlessly prioritizing engineering resources toward Institutional-Grade infrastructure. As PM, I'll make the hard calls about what NOT to build — sunsetting products that don't serve the stablecoin thesis to free up capacity. This portfolio rationalization skill is harder than building new things and justifies a 20% premium over feature-level PM comp."

**Lever 4 — Illiquidity Premium for Product Leadership:**
> "Product managers at Stripe, Adyen, and Google receive liquid equity as a significant portion of total comp. Rapyd's private options require me to accept meaningful liquidity risk. I need the options grant increased by 25% over the initial offer, plus a $25,000 signing bonus, to make the risk-adjusted package competitive with my liquid alternatives."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target total comp of $350K–$403K in SF (£115K–£122K base London, ₪560K–₪610K base Tel Aviv). Anchor base at $205K–$228K in SF. Push options to 25% above initial offer — target $140K–$175K annualized. Request a $25,000 signing bonus. Frame every ask around the Stablecoin Mainstream moment, 34% adoption, and Institutional-Grade Execution product vision. Accept-at floor: $190K base / $115K options annualized in SF-equivalent terms — below this, Stripe PM and Checkout.com PM offers with liquid equity are clearly superior.
