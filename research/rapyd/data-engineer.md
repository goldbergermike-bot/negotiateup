#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £68,000–£108,000 | £38,000–£82,000 | £106,000–£190,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪345,000–₪530,000 | ₪190,000–₪395,000 | ₪535,000–₪925,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $142,000–$205,000 | $68,000–$145,000 | $210,000–$350,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Data Engineer at Rapyd builds and maintains the data infrastructure that powers one of the most data-intensive platforms in fintech — billions of payment events across 900+ payment methods in 100+ countries. With the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report confirming 34% business adoption, the data engineering challenge has expanded to include on-chain stablecoin data: settlement transactions, blockchain event logs, smart contract state changes, and the hybrid data flows that connect fiat payment processing with stablecoin settlement. Building data pipelines that unify on-chain and off-chain data into a coherent analytical and operational layer is a novel challenge that most data engineers have never encountered. The Institutional-Grade Execution mandate means these pipelines must meet the same reliability, auditability, and latency requirements as traditional financial data infrastructure — while handling the fundamentally different data models of blockchain systems. Data engineers who can build institutional-grade hybrid fiat-stablecoin data infrastructure are in high demand at every major fintech, crypto company, and trading firm.

Checkout.com Data Engineers in London command £75K–£115K base with growth equity. Stripe Data Engineers in SF see $150K–$210K with liquid RSUs. Google and Databricks offer $300K+ total comp at senior DE level with fully liquid equity. Rapyd must compensate for illiquidity through the Stablecoin Mainstream upside narrative and competitive base salary.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report — 34% business adoption — creates a fundamentally new data engineering discipline: building the infrastructure that unifies fiat payment data with on-chain stablecoin settlement data at institutional grade.

This means designing pipelines that reconcile blockchain event logs with traditional payment records, enabling real-time settlement monitoring and compliance reporting across both rails. It means building data models that can represent a single transaction that settles partially in fiat and partially in stablecoins. It means ensuring that the data infrastructure meets regulatory audit requirements across MiCA, SEC, and FinCEN frameworks simultaneously.

The 34% adoption figure proves this is not a research project — enterprise customers need this data infrastructure today to make decisions about stablecoin settlement. Your negotiation leverage: the intersection of financial data engineering expertise and blockchain data infrastructure capability is extremely scarce, and the Institutional-Grade Execution mandate raises the bar far above what crypto-native data engineers typically deliver.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Hybrid Data Architecture for Stablecoin Mainstream:**
> "The Jan 2026 Stablecoins Report shows 34% business adoption. Rapyd needs a data engineer who can build the infrastructure that unifies fiat payment data with on-chain stablecoin settlement data for Institutional-Grade Execution. This hybrid data architecture is unprecedented at Rapyd's 100+ country scale. My base should reflect this architectural novelty: $195K in SF."

**Lever 2 — On-Chain Data Pipeline Innovation:**
> "Stablecoin settlement at 34% mainstream adoption means Rapyd needs production-grade data pipelines that process blockchain events with the same reliability and latency as fiat payment pipelines. I bring experience building real-time data systems for financial data. Building Institutional-Grade on-chain data infrastructure is greenfield work. My options grant should be $135K annualized to compensate for illiquidity and the pioneering scope."

**Lever 3 — Regulatory Data Compliance:**
> "Institutional-Grade Execution requires data infrastructure that satisfies regulatory audit requirements across multiple jurisdictions — MiCA in Europe, SEC/FinCEN in the US, and local requirements in 40+ markets. Every data pipeline must produce auditable, compliant records for both fiat and stablecoin transactions. This compliance-grade data engineering commands a premium over standard data engineering roles."

**Lever 4 — Illiquidity Premium for Data Engineering Talent:**
> "Data engineers at Google, Databricks, and Stripe earn premium liquid comp. Rapyd's illiquid options require a 25% larger grant than comparable liquid equity, plus an $18,000 signing bonus to bridge the first-year liquidity gap."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target total comp of $300K–$350K in SF (£95K–£108K base London, ₪478K–₪530K base Tel Aviv). Anchor base at $182K–$205K in SF. Push for 25% illiquidity premium on options — target $105K–$145K annualized. Request an $18,000 signing bonus. Frame every ask around the Stablecoin Mainstream data challenge, 34% adoption, and Institutional-Grade Execution data infrastructure. Accept-at floor: $168K base / $88K options annualized in SF-equivalent terms — below this, data engineering roles at Google, Stripe, or Databricks with liquid equity are clearly superior.
