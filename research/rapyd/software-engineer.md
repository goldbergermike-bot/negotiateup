### Software Engineer — Rapyd Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Rapyd's Stablecoin Mainstream strategy, translating the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report (34% business adoption) into a Software Engineer compensation framework spanning London, Tel Aviv, and San Francisco markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £55,000–£82,000 | £30,000–£60,000 | £85,000–£142,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪280,000–₪420,000 | ₪150,000–₪300,000 | ₪430,000–₪720,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $120,000–$168,000 | $60,000–$115,000 | $180,000–$283,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Rapyd's pivot from traditional payment rails to stablecoin-powered settlement — catalyzed by the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report showing 34% business adoption — has fundamentally changed how the company values engineering talent. As a Software Engineer, you are no longer just building payment integrations across 900+ methods; you are building the foundational primitives for Institutional-Grade Execution of stablecoin settlement infrastructure. The 34% adoption figure means stablecoins have crossed from crypto-native niche to mainstream business tool, and Rapyd needs engineers who can build compliant, enterprise-ready systems at the intersection of traditional fintech and digital assets. Your options vest over four years in a private company positioning itself at the center of this tectonic shift. The illiquidity of Rapyd options must be offset by competitive base salary and larger grant sizes — especially as competitors like Stripe and Adyen offer liquid or near-liquid equity.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Rapyd | Checkout.com | Airwallex | Nium | Stripe | Adyen |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Software Engineer | Software Engineer | Software Engineer | Software Engineer | L1 | Software Engineer |
| Software Engineer (Senior entry) | Software Engineer II | Software Engineer II | Software Engineer II | L1-L2 | Software Engineer II |

Rapyd's Software Engineer level maps to IC1-IC2 in the broader fintech ecosystem. Checkout.com and Airwallex offer comparable base salaries in London but with different equity structures — Checkout.com provides growth-stage equity with secondary market access, while Airwallex offers later-stage private options. Nium, as a competing payments-as-a-service player, benchmarks similarly but with Singapore-weighted comp. At this level, Rapyd must compete on total package to attract engineers who could otherwise join companies with liquid equity.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report marks a watershed moment: 34% of businesses now use stablecoins for payments, treasury, or settlement — up from single digits just two years prior. This is not speculative crypto adoption; this is mainstream business infrastructure. Rapyd, with its existing payment orchestration layer spanning 100+ countries, is uniquely positioned to become the Institutional-Grade Execution platform for stablecoin-powered commerce.

For Software Engineers, this means every API endpoint, every microservice, every integration you build is now dual-purpose: it must handle traditional fiat payment rails AND stablecoin settlement flows. The premium for engineers who can build compliant, institutional-grade crypto systems — systems that satisfy both financial regulators and enterprise procurement teams — is significant and growing. Rapyd is competing for this talent against crypto-native companies (Circle, Paxos), traditional fintech (Stripe, Adyen), and Big Tech firms building Web3 infrastructure.

Your negotiation leverage: you are building infrastructure that sits at the convergence of the $2T+ global payments market and the rapidly mainstreaming stablecoin economy. The 34% adoption figure is your strongest data point — it proves that stablecoin infrastructure is no longer experimental, it is enterprise-critical, and engineers who can build it command a premium.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Illiquidity Premium on Private Options:**
> "Rapyd's options are in a private company. Unlike Stripe's pre-IPO RSUs with secondary market access or Adyen's publicly traded shares, I cannot monetize these options on any timeline I control. Industry-standard illiquidity discounts run 20-35%. I'm requesting a 25% increase to the options grant — moving from the midpoint to the 75th percentile — to compensate for this liquidity risk."

**Lever 2 — Stablecoin Mainstream Execution Premium:**
> "The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report shows 34% business adoption. Rapyd's pivot to stablecoin-powered settlement means you need engineers who can build Institutional-Grade Execution infrastructure — compliant, enterprise-ready crypto settlement systems. This skill set commands a premium above standard payments engineering. I'm asking for base salary at the top of band to reflect the stablecoin infrastructure premium: $168K in SF, £82K in London, or ₪420K in Tel Aviv."

**Lever 3 — Multi-Rail Complexity Premium:**
> "Building systems that handle both traditional fiat payment rails across 900+ methods AND stablecoin settlement flows is fundamentally more complex than either domain alone. I bring experience across both paradigms. This dual competency justifies positioning my compensation at the 75th percentile across all components."

**Lever 4 — Institutional-Grade Compliance Overlay:**
> "Stablecoins going mainstream at 34% business adoption means regulators are paying attention. Every system I build must satisfy enterprise compliance requirements AND emerging crypto regulations simultaneously. Engineers who understand this compliance overlay — building for both MiCA in Europe and SEC/FinCEN frameworks in the US — are scarce and command premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Push base salary to the 75th percentile: $155K+ in SF, £74K+ in London, ₪385K+ in Tel Aviv. Request a 25% illiquidity premium on the options grant, moving annualized value from $87K to $109K. Target a signing bonus of $15,000–$20,000 to bridge the gap between current liquid comp and Rapyd's illiquid options. Frame every ask around the Stablecoin Mainstream thesis and the 34% adoption data point. Accept-at floor: $140K base / $78K options annualized in SF-equivalent terms — below this, the illiquidity risk and stablecoin execution premium are not adequately compensated.
