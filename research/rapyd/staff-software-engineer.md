#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £110,000–£150,000 | £90,000–£160,000 | £200,000–£310,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪560,000–₪750,000 | ₪430,000–₪780,000 | ₪990,000–₪1,530,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Staff Software Engineer at Rapyd operates at the intersection of technical vision and strategic architecture — the level where individual decisions shape entire platform capabilities for years. With the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report confirming 34% business adoption, Rapyd's Stablecoin Mainstream pivot places staff-level engineers at the center of the company's most consequential technical bet: building Institutional-Grade Execution infrastructure for stablecoin settlement that can serve enterprise customers at global scale. At staff level, you are not just writing code or even designing systems — you are defining the technical strategy that determines whether Rapyd captures or loses the institutional stablecoin opportunity. The scarcity of engineers who can operate at this level of abstraction, across both traditional payment rails and stablecoin infrastructure, gives you exceptional negotiation leverage. Rapyd competes for staff-level talent against principal/staff offers from Stripe ($350K–$500K TC with liquid RSUs), Adyen (public equity), and crypto-native firms (Circle, Paxos) that offer token-based compensation with immediate liquidity.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Rapyd | Checkout.com | Airwallex | Nium | Stripe | Adyen |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Staff Software Engineer | Staff Engineer | Staff Engineer | Principal Engineer | L3 | Staff Engineer |
| Staff Software Engineer (top) | Staff Engineer II | Principal Engineer | Distinguished | L3-L4 | Staff Engineer II |

At staff level, comp dispersion widens dramatically. Stripe L3s in SF command $250K–$310K base with $200K+ annualized RSUs. Checkout.com Staff Engineers in London see £130K–£160K base. Airwallex Staff Engineers benchmark similarly with Singapore-weighted options. Rapyd must compensate for illiquidity with larger grants and competitive base — the 34% stablecoin adoption thesis and the Institutional-Grade Execution mandate are the upside stories that justify accepting illiquid options.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report represents a structural shift in the payments industry: with 34% of businesses now using stablecoins, the technology has crossed the threshold from early-adopter curiosity to mainstream infrastructure requirement. For Rapyd, this is a once-in-a-decade platform expansion opportunity — the company's existing payment orchestration layer, spanning 100+ countries and 900+ payment methods, becomes the natural integration point for stablecoin settlement flows.

Staff Software Engineers are the keystone of this transition. The Institutional-Grade Execution mandate requires building stablecoin settlement infrastructure that meets the same reliability, compliance, and auditability standards as traditional banking rails — while operating at the speed and cost advantages that make stablecoins attractive. This means designing systems for real-time cross-border settlement in stablecoins, building compliance engines that satisfy MiCA, SEC, and FinCEN simultaneously, and architecting for the hybrid world where a single transaction might settle partially in fiat and partially in stablecoins.

The 34% adoption figure is your most powerful negotiation anchor. It proves that stablecoin infrastructure is not speculative R&D — it is core business infrastructure that enterprise customers are demanding today. Rapyd's ability to execute on this opportunity depends directly on staff-level engineers who can architect Institutional-Grade systems. The premium for this capability is 20-30% above traditional payments engineering at the same level.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Technical Strategy Ownership for Stablecoin Mainstream:**
> "At staff level, I'm defining Rapyd's technical strategy for stablecoin settlement — the architecture that will determine whether the company captures the Institutional-Grade Execution opportunity validated by 34% business adoption in the Jan 2026 Stablecoins Report. This is not feature work; this is platform-defining architecture. I need compensation that reflects strategic ownership: $270K+ base in SF with options at the 90th percentile of the band."

**Lever 2 — Dual-Domain Scarcity Premium:**
> "Engineers who can architect systems spanning traditional payment orchestration AND stablecoin settlement at institutional grade are exceptionally rare. The Jan 2026 Stablecoins Report's 34% adoption figure means demand for this talent is surging while supply remains constrained. I'm requesting a 35% premium on the options grant to reflect this scarcity and the illiquidity risk of private company options."

**Lever 3 — Competitive Offers with Liquid Equity:**
> "I have offers from Stripe (L3, $450K+ TC with liquid RSUs) and from crypto-native infrastructure companies with token compensation. Rapyd's illiquid options require a meaningful premium to compete on a risk-adjusted basis. I'm asking for annualized options value of $240K+ to offset the liquidity gap, or a base salary increase to $280K to reduce my exposure to illiquidity risk."

**Lever 4 — Institutional-Grade Compliance Architecture:**
> "Stablecoins at 34% mainstream adoption means regulators globally are implementing comprehensive frameworks — MiCA in Europe, evolving SEC/FinCEN guidance in the US, MAS frameworks in Singapore. I architect systems that satisfy all of these simultaneously. This compliance-embedded-in-architecture capability is what differentiates Institutional-Grade Execution from crypto-native 'move fast and break things.' It commands a significant premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Anchor base salary at $255K–$280K in SF (£135K–£150K London, ₪680K–₪750K Tel Aviv). Push options grant to the 90th percentile — target $220K–$260K annualized. Request a $40,000–$60,000 signing bonus to offset year-one illiquidity gap vs. Stripe/Adyen offers. Frame every ask around the Stablecoin Mainstream thesis, 34% adoption, and Institutional-Grade Execution scarcity. Accept-at floor: $240K base / $180K options annualized in SF-equivalent terms — below this, the risk-adjusted package falls below Stripe L3 and Checkout.com Staff offers.
