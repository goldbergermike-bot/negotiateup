#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £68,000–£102,000 | £36,000–£78,000 | £104,000–£180,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪340,000–₪510,000 | ₪185,000–₪375,000 | ₪525,000–₪885,000 |
| 🇺🇸 San Francisco (USD) | $142,000–$198,000 | $68,000–$135,000 | $210,000–$333,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The DevOps Engineer at Rapyd is the guardian of uptime for a platform that processes real money across 100+ countries through 900+ payment methods. With the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report showing 34% business adoption, your scope expands dramatically: you are now responsible for infrastructure that spans both traditional payment processing AND stablecoin settlement systems. The Institutional-Grade Execution mandate means Rapyd's stablecoin infrastructure must meet the same uptime, reliability, and auditability standards as traditional banking rails — and you are the engineer who ensures this. When Rapyd's infrastructure goes down, merchants cannot collect payments, settlements fail, and in the stablecoin context, a failure could mean irrecoverable loss of funds rather than just delayed processing. The blast radius of a DevOps failure at Rapyd is measured in millions of dollars per hour and regulatory consequences. DevOps engineers with financial infrastructure experience who also understand blockchain node operations, smart contract deployment pipelines, and stablecoin settlement infrastructure are vanishingly rare.

Checkout.com DevOps in London command £75K–£110K base. Stripe Infrastructure Engineers in SF see $150K–$210K with liquid RSUs. Google SREs (L4-L5) offer $300K+ total comp with fully liquid equity. Rapyd must offset illiquidity with larger option grants and competitive base, especially as the Stablecoin Mainstream pivot adds blockchain infrastructure complexity.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report — 34% business adoption — transforms the DevOps role at Rapyd from traditional payment infrastructure operations to a hybrid mandate: maintaining fiat payment rails while building and operating Institutional-Grade stablecoin settlement infrastructure.

This means blockchain node management, smart contract deployment pipelines, on-chain monitoring, private key infrastructure, and the hybrid cloud-chain architectures that connect Rapyd's existing payment platform to stablecoin settlement layers. The Institutional-Grade Execution mandate adds regulatory-grade audit logging, disaster recovery for crypto wallets, and zero-downtime deployment across both fiat and stablecoin rails.

The 34% adoption figure proves this is not experimental infrastructure — it is production infrastructure that enterprise customers will depend on for settlement. A DevOps engineer who can build and operate both traditional payment infrastructure AND stablecoin settlement systems at institutional grade commands a significant premium. Your negotiation leverage comes from the scarcity of this dual-domain DevOps expertise and the existential consequences of infrastructure failure in a stablecoin settlement context.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Stablecoin Infrastructure Criticality:**
> "The Jan 2026 Stablecoins Report showing 34% business adoption means Rapyd's stablecoin settlement infrastructure is production-critical, not experimental. I'll be operating systems where a single infrastructure failure could mean irrecoverable financial loss. This Institutional-Grade Execution criticality premium justifies a base of $190K in SF with options at $125K annualized."

**Lever 2 — Hybrid Infrastructure Expertise:**
> "Building and operating infrastructure that spans traditional cloud (payment processing) AND blockchain (stablecoin settlement) is a novel DevOps challenge. Blockchain node operations, smart contract deployment, and on-chain monitoring require fundamentally different tooling and expertise than traditional DevOps. I bring experience across both domains. This dual-infrastructure premium justifies a 25% uplift on the options grant."

**Lever 3 — Institutional-Grade Automation:**
> "Rapyd's Stablecoin Mainstream pivot requires zero-touch deployments across both fiat and stablecoin rails, automated compliance checks, and self-healing infrastructure that meets Institutional-Grade standards. I will build the automation that makes this possible. My bonus should be 15% of base tied to automation coverage and incident reduction metrics."

**Lever 4 — Illiquidity Premium with On-Call Burden:**
> "DevOps at a global payment and stablecoin settlement platform means 24/7 on-call responsibility for infrastructure that cannot fail. Combined with Rapyd's illiquid options, this on-call burden requires a $20,000 signing bonus and explicit on-call compensation to make the package competitive with SRE roles at Google or Stripe that offer liquid equity and comparable scope."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Target total comp of $295K–$333K in SF (£90K–£102K base London, ₪460K–₪510K base Tel Aviv). Anchor base at $178K–$198K in SF. Push for 25% illiquidity premium on options — target $100K–$135K annualized. Request a $20,000 signing bonus and on-call compensation. Frame every ask around the Stablecoin Mainstream infrastructure challenge, 34% adoption, and Institutional-Grade Execution reliability. Accept-at floor: $162K base / $85K options annualized in SF-equivalent terms — below this, SRE/DevOps roles at Google, Stripe, or major banks with liquid comp are better options.
