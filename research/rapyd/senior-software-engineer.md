#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇬🇧 London (GBP) | £78,000–£115,000 | £55,000–£95,000 | £133,000–£210,000 |
| 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv (ILS) | ₪400,000–₪570,000 | ₪260,000–₪460,000 | ₪660,000–₪1,030,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Senior Software Engineer at Rapyd is the execution backbone of the platform — the engineer who owns entire subsystems within the fintech-as-a-service stack and makes architectural decisions that compound for years. With the Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report revealing 34% business adoption, Rapyd's strategic pivot to stablecoin-powered settlement transforms this role from payments infrastructure engineer into an Institutional-Grade Execution architect. At senior level, you are making the design decisions that determine whether Rapyd can credibly serve as the settlement layer for mainstream stablecoin commerce. These decisions are not reversible. The systems you design now will either enable or constrain Rapyd's ability to capture the institutional stablecoin opportunity. Your negotiation leverage is substantial: senior engineers with payments domain expertise AND understanding of stablecoin/crypto settlement infrastructure are among the most scarce profiles in fintech, courted simultaneously by Stripe, Adyen, Checkout.com, Circle, and Paxos.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Rapyd | Checkout.com | Airwallex | Nium | Stripe | Adyen |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Senior Software Engineer | Senior Software Engineer | Senior Software Engineer | Senior Software Engineer | L2 | Senior Software Engineer |
| Senior Software Engineer (top) | Senior Software Engineer II | Senior Software Engineer II | Staff (entry) | L2-L3 | Senior Software Engineer II |

At the senior level, comp divergence becomes meaningful. Checkout.com Senior Engineers in London command £95K–£120K base with growth equity; Airwallex offers comparable base with Singapore-weighted options. Stripe L2s see $180K–$230K base with pre-IPO RSUs that have secondary liquidity. Rapyd must close this gap through larger option grants or higher base, especially given the illiquidity of Rapyd equity.

#### 🏛️ Rapyd Stablecoin Mainstream & Institutional-Grade Execution Lever

The Jan 2026 State of Stablecoins Report is a landmark data point: 34% of businesses now actively use stablecoins, marking the transition from crypto-native experiment to mainstream financial infrastructure. For Rapyd — already operating payment orchestration across 100+ countries with 900+ payment methods — this represents a massive expansion of addressable market. The company's existing rails, compliance infrastructure, and merchant relationships become the foundation for Institutional-Grade Execution of stablecoin settlement.

For Senior Software Engineers, the Stablecoin Mainstream thesis changes the scope and value of the role dramatically. You are no longer optimizing fiat payment flows; you are building the dual-rail architecture — traditional payments AND stablecoin settlement — that will define fintech infrastructure for the next decade. The 34% adoption figure means enterprise customers are already demanding stablecoin settlement options, and Rapyd needs senior engineers who can build these systems to institutional standards: auditable, compliant, fault-tolerant, and scalable.

The Institutional-Grade Execution premium for senior engineers is real and quantifiable. Engineers who have built both traditional payment settlement AND crypto/blockchain infrastructure command 15-25% premiums over peers with only one domain. When you negotiate, anchor on the 34% adoption figure and the fact that Rapyd's competitive position depends on shipping Institutional-Grade stablecoin infrastructure faster than Checkout.com, Stripe, or Adyen.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Stablecoin Architecture Ownership:**
> "As a Senior Engineer, I'll own the architectural decisions that shape Rapyd's stablecoin settlement infrastructure. The Jan 2026 Stablecoins Report shows 34% business adoption — this is the moment these systems must be built right. My design choices are not reversible and will compound for years. I need compensation that reflects this architectural ownership: base at top of band — $215K in SF — and options reflecting the outsized impact of Institutional-Grade Execution."

**Lever 2 — Dual-Rail Expertise Premium:**
> "Rapyd needs engineers who understand both traditional payment rails and stablecoin settlement. I bring experience across both paradigms — fiat payment orchestration AND blockchain-based settlement systems. This dual competency is exactly what the 34% business adoption moment demands: Institutional-Grade Execution infrastructure that bridges legacy and crypto. I'm requesting a 30% increase on the options grant to reflect this premium."

**Lever 3 — Illiquidity Offset with Stablecoin Upside:**
> "Rapyd's options carry real illiquidity risk as a private company. But the Stablecoin Mainstream thesis — validated by 34% business adoption — represents significant upside potential. I need my base salary to stand on its own without requiring me to bet living expenses on the stablecoin thesis. That means $200K+ base in SF, with options as the upside vehicle for the Institutional-Grade Execution opportunity."

**Lever 4 — Competitive Scarcity in Stablecoin Infrastructure:**
> "The intersection of payments infrastructure expertise and stablecoin/crypto engineering is one of the tightest talent markets in fintech. I have competing offers from companies with liquid equity. To make Rapyd's illiquid options competitive, I need the overall package — base plus annualized options — to exceed my liquid alternatives by at least 15% on a risk-adjusted basis."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Anchor base salary at $200K–$220K in SF (£102K–£115K London, ₪530K–₪570K Tel Aviv). Push options grant 30% above initial offer to compensate for illiquidity — target $140K–$165K annualized. Request a $25,000–$35,000 signing bonus. Frame every lever around Stablecoin Mainstream and the 34% business adoption data point. Accept-at floor: $190K base / $115K options annualized / $20K signing bonus in SF-equivalent terms — below this, the risk-adjusted comp falls below Stripe L2 and Checkout.com Senior offers with liquid equity.
