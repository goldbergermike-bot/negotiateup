**Negotiation DNA**

Elastic Data Engineers build the data infrastructure that powers internal analytics, ESRE model training pipelines, and the customer-facing data ingestion capabilities (Elastic Agent, Fleet, Integrations). The unique position: you're a data engineer at a search/analytics company — building the data pipelines that feed the world's most-deployed search and analytics engine. In 2026, ESRE creates new data engineering challenges: training data pipelines for ELSER model updates, relevance feedback loops, vector embedding generation pipelines, and the data infrastructure that enables continuous ML model improvement. Elastic's three-solution portfolio (Search, Security, Observability) means data engineering serves all three simultaneously. Small bonus; equity is the lever. [Source: Elastic DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Elastic Senior DE = Google L4 DE = MongoDB Senior DE = Confluent Senior DE

**Global Levers**

1. **ELSER Training Pipeline:** "I build the data pipelines that train ELSER — Elastic's ML retrieval model. Training data quality directly determines ELSER's competitive retrieval performance against MongoDB Voyage AI."
2. **Data Ingestion at Search Scale:** "Elastic Agent and Fleet manage data ingestion from millions of sources. I build the data infrastructure that feeds Elasticsearch — the ingest pipeline that processes billions of events daily."
3. **Three-Solution Data Foundation:** "My data engineering serves Search, Security, and Observability simultaneously. One data pipeline architecture, three solution portfolios — compounding impact."
4. **Equity Push:** Push for 25% more RSUs: "The ELSER training pipeline is the ML foundation for ESRE. My data engineering determines the quality of Elastic's AI search product."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a data engineering role building ELSER training pipelines AND Elastic's data ingestion infrastructure at search scale, I'm targeting $242K in RSUs over 4 years. My data quality determines ESRE's competitive ML performance. I have competing DE offers from [MongoDB/Databricks]." Elastic will counter at $215K-$238K RSUs — accept at $225K+.
