### ML/AI Engineer | Elastic Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Small Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | **+20–35% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM** | ESRE Core Team

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $188K–$232K | $218K–$365K | 5–10% | $252K–$338K |
| Amsterdam | €80K–€105K | €88K–€148K | 5–10% | €108K–€152K |
| Bangalore | ₹48L–₹72L | ₹40L–₹65L | 5–10% | ₹62L–₹95L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Elastic ML/AI Engineers are the builders of ESRE — the Elasticsearch Relevance Engine that is Elastic's primary competitive weapon in the Battle for the AI Data Layer. You build ELSER (learned sparse retrieval), semantic reranking models, query understanding systems, vector search optimization, and the AI assistants for Security and Observability. This is the role where the "Battle for the AI Data Layer" is fought most directly: your ML model quality vs. MongoDB Voyage AI's embedding quality determines which platform enterprises choose for AI search. The Agentic AI Premium (20-35%) applies because you're building autonomous search agents — systems that understand user intent, self-optimize retrieval quality, and continuously improve through feedback loops without human intervention.

**Level Mapping:** Elastic Senior ML Eng = Google L4 ML = MongoDB Senior ML (Voyage AI) = Snowflake Senior ML (Cortex)

**Global Levers**

1. **ELSER — Elastic's AI Moat:** "I build ELSER — the learned sparse retrieval model that is Elastic's primary differentiator against MongoDB Voyage AI and purpose-built vector databases. My model quality directly determines competitive outcomes in the AI data layer battle."
2. **20 Years of Search Expertise + Modern ML:** "Elastic has 20 years of search expertise. I combine that with modern ML techniques — transformer models, learned sparse retrieval, semantic reranking. That search + ML intersection is Elastic's unique advantage."
3. **Agentic AI Premium (20-35%):** "I build autonomous search agents — systems that understand user intent, self-optimize retrieval quality, and continuously improve through relevance feedback loops. This is agentic AI applied to search: autonomous information retrieval."
4. **Equity Push — Maximum ML Premium:** Push for 35% more RSUs: "ML engineers building competitive retrieval models are the most strategically important engineering role at Elastic. I determine whether Elastic wins or loses the AI data layer battle. I have competing ML offers from MongoDB Voyage AI at $350K and Databricks Mosaic ML at $420K."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an ML/AI role building ELSER and ESRE — the models that determine whether Elastic wins the AI data layer battle — I'm targeting $350K in RSUs over 4 years with the 20-35% Agentic AI Premium. My model quality vs. MongoDB Voyage AI's embedding quality is the competitive battleground. I have a MongoDB Voyage AI offer at $350K RSUs and a Databricks Mosaic ML offer with pre-IPO equity at $420K. Elastic's 20 years of search expertise + ML is the most compelling, but the equity must reflect that I'm building the competitive weapon." Elastic will counter at $305K-$345K RSUs — accept at $320K+.
