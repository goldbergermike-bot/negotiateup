### Data Scientist | Elastic Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Small Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | ESRE Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $168K–$208K | $165K–$275K | 5–10% | $205K–$275K |
| Amsterdam | €70K–€90K | €65K–€110K | 5–10% | €85K–€118K |
| Bangalore | ₹38L–₹58L | ₹28L–₹48L | 5–10% | ₹48L–₹75L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Elastic Data Scientists work with the world's largest corpus of search relevance data — billions of queries, click-through rates, relevance signals, and retrieval patterns from Elasticsearch deployments worldwide. This data powers ESRE's ML capabilities: ELSER (Elastic Learned Sparse EncodeR), semantic reranking, query understanding, and the relevance feedback loops that continuously improve search quality. The unique position: you're a data scientist AT a search company, building the ML models that make search intelligent. ESRE's competitive positioning against MongoDB Voyage AI depends on ML retrieval quality — your models directly determine competitive outcomes. Small bonus; equity is the lever.

**Level Mapping:** Elastic Senior DS = Google L4 DS = MongoDB Senior DS = Snowflake Senior DS (Cortex)

**Global Levers**

1. **ELSER — Elastic's ML Retrieval Moat:** "I build ELSER — Elastic's learned sparse retrieval model. ELSER's retrieval quality directly determines whether enterprises choose Elastic or MongoDB Voyage AI for their AI search layer."
2. **Search Relevance Data Moat:** "Billions of search queries, click-through signals, and relevance feedback from Elasticsearch deployments worldwide. This proprietary relevance dataset enables ML models that no competitor can build."
3. **ML IS the Search Product:** "ESRE's value proposition is ML-powered search. ELSER, semantic reranking, and query understanding are all ML products. My models don't support the product — they ARE the product."
4. **Equity Push — ML Scarcity:** Push for 30% more RSUs: "ML engineers who understand information retrieval (not just NLP/CV) are extremely rare. Search relevance ML is a specialized discipline that commands a premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a DS role building ELSER and ESRE's ML retrieval capabilities — the models that determine whether Elastic wins the AI data layer battle against MongoDB Voyage AI — I'm targeting $260K in RSUs over 4 years. I have a MongoDB Voyage AI DS offer at $280K and a Snowflake Cortex offer at $290K. Elastic's search ML expertise is the deepest, but the equity needs to match." Elastic will counter at $230K-$255K RSUs — accept at $240K+.
