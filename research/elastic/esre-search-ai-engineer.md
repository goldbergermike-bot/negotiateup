**Negotiation DNA**

This is Elastic's signature role for 2026 — the ESRE Search AI Engineer. You build the Elasticsearch Relevance Engine from the ground up: ELSER (learned sparse retrieval), vector search optimization, hybrid retrieval algorithms (BM25 + vector + sparse + reciprocal rank fusion), semantic reranking, and the AI-powered search assistants that make Elasticsearch the intelligent search layer for the AI economy. This role exists at the exact intersection of information retrieval and modern AI — and it's where the "Battle for the AI Data Layer" is fought most directly. Your ESRE model quality vs. MongoDB Voyage AI's embedding quality. Your hybrid retrieval algorithms vs. Pinecone's pure vector approach. Your search expertise vs. every competitor's.

**Level Mapping:** Elastic ESRE Search AI Eng (Senior) = MongoDB Voyage AI Search Eng = Google L4-L5 Search Ranking = Pinecone Senior ML Eng

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The ESRE Search AI Engineer works at the convergence of 20 years of search expertise and cutting-edge AI:
- **ELSER (Elastic Learned Sparse EncodeR):** The proprietary learned sparse retrieval model that outperforms dense vector search on many retrieval benchmarks — Elastic's primary ML differentiator
- **Hybrid Retrieval Engine:** The algorithm that fuses BM25 lexical search, dense vector search, learned sparse search, and semantic reranking into a single retrieval pipeline — no other search engine does this natively
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion:** The score combination algorithms that blend multiple retrieval signals optimally — determining the final ranking that users see
- **AI Assistants:** The conversational AI layer (Elastic AI Assistant for Security, Elastic AI Assistant for Observability) that uses ESRE for knowledge retrieval in natural-language investigation workflows
- **Continuous Relevance Optimization:** The feedback loops that continuously improve retrieval quality based on user interaction signals — autonomous search improvement

**Global Levers**

1. **ESRE vs. Voyage AI — The Direct Competitive Battle:** "My ESRE model quality directly competes with MongoDB Voyage AI's embedding quality. This is the decisive engineering battleground in the AI data layer war. My models determine whether Elastic wins or loses."
2. **Hybrid Retrieval — Elastic's Structural Advantage:** "No other search engine natively fuses BM25 + vector + sparse + reranking in a single query. My hybrid retrieval algorithms are Elastic's structural advantage over pure vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate) and document-first databases (MongoDB)."
3. **20 Years of Search + Modern AI:** "I build on 20 years of Elasticsearch search expertise — inverted indexes, BM25, Lucene — combined with modern AI: transformers, learned sparse retrieval, semantic reranking. This combination doesn't exist anywhere else."
4. **AI Assistants — Search-Powered Agents:** "The Elastic AI Assistants use ESRE for knowledge retrieval in conversational investigation workflows. I'm building the search intelligence that makes AI assistants actually useful for security and operations professionals."
5. **Agentic AI Premium (20-35%):** If building the continuous relevance optimization or autonomous search improvement systems, push for the full premium: "I'm building self-improving search — systems that autonomously optimize retrieval quality through feedback loops. This is agentic AI applied to the most fundamental AI capability: finding the right information."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $365K in RSUs over 4 years with a 12% bonus for this ESRE Search AI Engineer role. I'm building the retrieval models that directly compete with MongoDB Voyage AI — this is the decisive engineering battleground in the AI data layer war. My hybrid retrieval algorithms (BM25 + vector + sparse + reranking) are Elastic's structural advantage that no competitor can replicate. I have a MongoDB Voyage AI offer at $355K RSUs and a Pinecone senior offer at $380K total. Elastic's 20 years of search expertise combined with modern AI is the most compelling search ML opportunity — but the equity must reflect that ESRE is Elastic's competitive weapon." Elastic will counter at $315K-$355K RSUs — accept at $335K+ with 10-12% bonus confirmed. This is the role that determines whether Elastic wins the Battle for the AI Data Layer.
