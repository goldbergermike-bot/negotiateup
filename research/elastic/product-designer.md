**Negotiation DNA**

Design at Elastic centers on Kibana — the open-source visualization and analytics platform that's the interface for Elasticsearch, Security SIEM, and Observability. The design challenge is extraordinary: making petabyte-scale search, security event investigation, and infrastructure monitoring intuitive through a single design system (EUI — Elastic UI). In 2026, new design surfaces emerge from ESRE: AI search configuration, relevance tuning UIs, vector search visualization, and the AI assistant (Elastic AI Assistant for Security and Observability). Elastic's distributed-first culture means designers work with globally distributed teams. Small bonus; equity is the lever. [Source: Elastic Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Elastic Senior Designer = Google L4 UX = MongoDB Senior Designer = Datadog Senior Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Kibana — The Open-Source Visualization Standard:** "Kibana is the most widely-used open-source visualization platform for search and analytics. My design decisions affect millions of users worldwide — this is design at open-source scale."
2. **Three-Solution Design Surface:** "I design across Search, Security, and Observability — three solutions, one design system (EUI). Cross-solution design coherence is one of the hardest UX challenges in enterprise software."
3. **AI Search UX:** "ESRE creates new design surfaces: relevance tuning, vector search visualization, AI assistant interfaces. I'm designing the UX for AI-powered search — a product category being defined in real-time."
4. **Equity Push:** Push for 20-25% more RSUs: "Kibana's design directly impacts Elastic Cloud adoption. Good UX drives conversion from self-managed to cloud. My design work IS the conversion funnel."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a design role across Kibana's three-solution surface — Search, Security, and Observability — plus new AI search UX for ESRE, I'm targeting $155K in RSUs over 4 years. Kibana's UX directly drives Elastic Cloud conversion. I have competing design offers with stronger equity." Elastic will counter at $132K-$150K RSUs — accept at $140K+.
