### Solutions Architect | Elastic Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Small Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | ESRE Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $165K–$205K | $148K–$248K | 5–10% | $195K–$262K |
| Amsterdam | €68K–€88K | €58K–€100K | 5–10% | €80K–€108K |
| Bangalore | ₹38L–₹58L | ₹28L–₹45L | 5–10% | ₹48L–₹72L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Elastic SAs guide enterprise customers through deploying the three-solution stack: Search (ESRE, App Search), Security (SIEM, Endpoint, Cloud Security), and Observability (APM, Logs, Metrics). The SA opportunity in 2026: every ESRE conversation is a new revenue motion — helping customers implement AI search, RAG pipelines, and vector search alongside existing Elasticsearch deployments. SAs who can articulate the ESRE value proposition against MongoDB Voyage AI and purpose-built vector databases drive the highest-value deals. The three-solution portfolio means cross-sell opportunities are built into every engagement. Small bonus; equity is the lever. [Source: Elastic SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Elastic Senior SA = Google Customer Engineer = MongoDB Senior SA = Datadog Senior SA

**Global Levers**

1. **ESRE Solution Selling — New Revenue Motion:** "ESRE creates a new SA motion: AI search solutions, RAG pipeline architecture, and vector search consulting alongside traditional Elasticsearch. Every customer is a potential ESRE upsell."
2. **Three-Solution Cross-Sell:** "I sell across Search, Security, and Observability — three solutions in every engagement. Cross-solution SAs drive 2-3x the deal size of single-solution SAs."
3. **Anti-MongoDB Competitive Positioning:** "Customers choosing between Elastic ESRE and MongoDB Voyage AI for their AI search layer is a 2026 competitive battleground. I position Elastic's search-first advantage: deeper relevance, ELSER, and 20 years of search expertise."
4. **Equity Push:** Push for 20-25% more RSUs: "I drive ESRE adoption and three-solution cross-sell — that's 2-3x revenue influence per engagement."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an SA role driving ESRE adoption and three-solution cross-sell — competing directly with MongoDB Voyage AI for AI search deals — I'm targeting $235K in RSUs over 4 years. I drive 2-3x revenue per engagement through cross-solution selling. I have competing SA offers from [MongoDB/Datadog]." Elastic will counter at $205K-$230K RSUs — accept at $215K+.
