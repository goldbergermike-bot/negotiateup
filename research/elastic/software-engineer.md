### Software Engineer | Elastic Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Small Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | ESRE (Elasticsearch Relevance Engine) Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $148K–$182K | $105K–$180K | 5–10% | $168K–$218K |
| Amsterdam | €55K–€72K | €40K–€68K | 5–10% | €65K–€88K |
| Bangalore | ₹28L–₹45L | ₹18L–₹32L | 5–10% | ₹35L–₹55L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Elastic is fighting the "Battle for the AI Data Layer" from the search side — while MongoDB approaches AI through document storage + vector search, Elastic approaches through search relevance + vector retrieval. ESRE (Elasticsearch Relevance Engine) is Elastic's AI search product: combining BM25 lexical search with vector search, learned sparse retrieval (ELSER), and reciprocal rank fusion into a unified relevance stack. Every AI application needs search — and Elastic is positioning Elasticsearch as the default search layer for RAG, AI agents, and retrieval-augmented generation. The comp model is equity-heavy with a small bonus (5-10%). Elastic's stock has been volatile — push for larger RSU grants to account for price uncertainty. [Source: Elastic SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Elastic SWE = Google L3 = Meta E3 = MongoDB SWE = Confluent SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **ESRE — AI Search Standard:** "ESRE combines BM25, vector search, and learned sparse retrieval into a unified relevance engine. I'm building the search infrastructure that every RAG pipeline and AI agent depends on — the search layer of the AI data layer."
2. **Search Is Universal for AI:** "Every AI application needs search: RAG needs retrieval, agents need knowledge lookup, chatbots need context. Elastic is the default search layer for AI. My work has universal AI application impact."
3. **Open-Source + Cloud Revenue:** "Elasticsearch is open-source with a massive community. Every engineering improvement drives both open-source adoption and Elastic Cloud conversion. My work feeds both community growth and revenue."
4. **Push Equity Hard — Small Bonus Means One Primary Lever:** With only 5-10% bonus, equity is your primary lever. Push for 25-30% more RSUs on the initial offer. Frame: "With a small bonus, the RSU grant needs to carry the compensation. I need $170K RSUs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I appreciate the initial offer. With a small bonus component, the RSU grant is the primary comp lever. Based on competing offers from [MongoDB Voyage AI/Databricks] and the ESRE opportunity, I need $170K in RSUs over 4 years. Elastic's AI search positioning is compelling — I want to build here — but the equity needs to reflect the market for AI data layer engineers." Elastic will counter at $148K-$165K RSUs — accept at $155K+.
