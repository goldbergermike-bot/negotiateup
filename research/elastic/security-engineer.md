**Negotiation DNA**

Elastic Security Engineers have the most compelling dual mandate in the industry: (1) building Elastic Security — the SIEM, Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR), and Cloud Security product that competes with Splunk, CrowdStrike, and Microsoft Sentinel — AND (2) securing the Elastic platform itself. The Security solution is one of Elastic's fastest-growing revenue segments, driven by SIEM customers migrating from Splunk. Your engineering work directly builds a product that generates revenue — this isn't cost-center security, it's revenue-generating product engineering. The ESRE AI capabilities enhance security with AI-powered threat detection and investigation. Small bonus; equity is the lever. [Source: Elastic Security Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Elastic Senior Security Eng = Google L4 Security = CrowdStrike Senior Eng = Datadog Senior Security Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Security Product Revenue — Not Cost Center:** "I BUILD the security product that competes with Splunk and CrowdStrike. My engineering work directly generates revenue — this is product engineering, not internal security overhead."
2. **SIEM Migration Wave:** "Enterprises are migrating from legacy SIEMs (Splunk) to Elastic SIEM. Every feature I ship accelerates this migration wave — directly driving Security solution ARR growth."
3. **AI-Powered Threat Detection:** "ESRE's ML capabilities enhance Elastic Security with AI-powered threat detection, automated investigation, and the Elastic AI Assistant for Security. I'm building the next generation of AI-driven security."
4. **Equity Push — Security Product Premium:** Push for 25-30% more RSUs: "I build a revenue-generating security product, not internal security. My engineering directly drives Security solution ARR. That product contribution justifies above-standard equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a security engineering role building Elastic SIEM — a revenue-generating security product competing with Splunk — AND integrating ESRE AI capabilities for threat detection, I'm targeting $285K in RSUs over 4 years. I build revenue, not overhead. I have competing security offers from [CrowdStrike/Datadog] with stronger total comp." Elastic will counter at $250K-$280K RSUs — accept at $262K+.
