**Negotiation DNA**

Elastic Platform Engineers build the infrastructure that runs Elastic Cloud — the managed Elasticsearch service across AWS, GCP, and Azure. This is the "search infrastructure for search infrastructure" challenge: building the Kubernetes orchestration, cluster provisioning, autoscaling, and multi-cloud deployment systems that host millions of Elasticsearch clusters. In 2026, new infrastructure challenges emerge from ESRE: GPU compute for ML inference (ELSER, semantic reranking), vector index management at scale, and the hybrid search infrastructure that serves BM25 + vector + sparse queries simultaneously. Multi-cloud reliability is critical — Elastic Cloud SLAs directly determine enterprise customer retention. Small bonus; equity is the lever. [Source: Elastic Platform Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Elastic Senior Platform Eng = Google L4 SRE = MongoDB Senior Platform Eng = Confluent Senior Platform Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Search Infrastructure at Cloud Scale:** "I build the multi-cloud infrastructure that hosts millions of Elasticsearch clusters. Every cluster provisioning, scaling, and failover decision I make affects Elastic Cloud reliability and revenue."
2. **ESRE GPU Infrastructure:** "ESRE's ML inference (ELSER, semantic reranking) requires GPU compute infrastructure alongside traditional search infrastructure. I'm building the hybrid CPU + GPU platform that powers AI search."
3. **Multi-Cloud Elasticsearch Hosting:** "Elastic Cloud runs on AWS, GCP, and Azure. I build the multi-cloud orchestration that ensures consistent search performance and reliability across all three cloud providers."
4. **Equity Push:** Push for 25% more RSUs: "Platform reliability IS the product for Elastic Cloud. My infrastructure work directly determines customer retention and SLA compliance."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a platform engineering role building multi-cloud Elastic Cloud infrastructure — including new GPU compute for ESRE ML inference — I'm targeting $255K in RSUs over 4 years. Platform reliability determines Elastic Cloud revenue retention. I have competing platform offers from [MongoDB/Confluent] with stronger equity." Elastic will counter at $225K-$250K RSUs — accept at $235K+.
