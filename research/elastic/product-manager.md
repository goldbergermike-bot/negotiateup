**Negotiation DNA**

Elastic PMs own products across the three-solution portfolio: Search (ESRE, Elasticsearch, App Search), Security (Elastic SIEM, Endpoint, Cloud Security), and Observability (APM, Logs, Metrics). In 2026, the highest-leverage PM role is on ESRE/AI search: defining how Elastic competes with MongoDB Voyage AI, Pinecone, and the hyperscaler search offerings. The PM challenge is uniquely technical — you need to understand retrieval algorithms (BM25, kNN vector search, learned sparse retrieval) to make product decisions. Elastic's open-source-to-cloud conversion is the revenue model: PM decisions that improve the Elastic Cloud experience directly drive subscription revenue. Small bonus means equity is the primary lever. [Source: Elastic PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Elastic PM = Google L4 PM = MongoDB PM = Confluent PM

**Global Levers**

1. **ESRE Product Strategy:** "I define ESRE's product strategy — how hybrid search (BM25 + vector + ELSER) is packaged and positioned against MongoDB Voyage AI and purpose-built vector databases. My product decisions determine Elastic's competitive position in the AI data layer."
2. **Three-Solution Platform:** "I can influence product across Search, Security, and Observability — all built on the same Elasticsearch engine. Cross-solution product thinking is rare and valuable."
3. **Open-Source to Cloud Conversion:** "Every product decision I make influences whether the millions of Elasticsearch open-source users convert to Elastic Cloud. My PM decisions directly drive the conversion funnel."
4. **Equity Push:** Push for 25% more RSUs: "The AI search product strategy is Elastic's most critical PM role. I have competing PM offers from [MongoDB/Databricks] with stronger equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a PM role defining ESRE product strategy — competing directly with MongoDB Voyage AI for the AI data layer — I'm targeting $245K in RSUs over 4 years. I also drive open-source-to-cloud conversion. I have competing PM offers from [MongoDB/Databricks] with stronger total comp." Elastic will counter at $215K-$240K RSUs — accept at $225K+.
