### Engineering Manager | Elastic Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Small Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | ESRE Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $200K–$245K | $250K–$400K | 8–12% | $278K–$358K |
| Amsterdam | €85K–€108K | €100K–€162K | 8–12% | €112K–€150K |
| Bangalore | ₹52L–₹75L | ₹42L–₹68L | 8–12% | ₹68L–₹102L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Elastic EMs lead teams building the core search engine, ESRE AI capabilities, Kibana visualization, Security SIEM, or Observability solutions. Elastic's distributed-first culture (remote-first since founding) means EMs manage globally distributed teams — a management challenge that's core to the company, not an exception. In 2026, the highest-leverage EM role is on the ESRE/AI search team: building and scaling the team that delivers Elastic's AI data layer strategy. Elastic expects EMs to be technically strong — you're reviewing Lucene PRs alongside managing your team. Equity is the primary comp lever. [Source: Elastic EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Elastic EM = Google L5 Manager = Meta M1 = MongoDB EM = Confluent EM

**Global Levers**

1. **ESRE Team Building:** "I'm building the team that delivers ESRE — Elastic's AI search product and the key to winning the AI data layer battle. Recruiting AI search specialists into a search company is my direct contribution to Elastic's competitive strategy."
2. **Distributed-First Management:** "Elastic has been remote-first since founding. I manage globally distributed teams across time zones — a management skill that's core to Elastic's culture, not an adaptation."
3. **Technical EM — Lucene Depth:** "Elastic expects EMs to be technically deep. I review Lucene-level PRs, debug distributed search issues, and set technical direction alongside managing my team."
4. **Equity Push:** Push for 25% more RSUs and push bonus to 12%: "I'm building the team that executes the AI search strategy. Team quality determines competitive outcomes. I have competing EM offers from [MongoDB/Confluent] with stronger total comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For an EM role building the ESRE/AI search team — the team that determines whether Elastic wins the AI data layer battle — I'm targeting $380K in RSUs over 4 years with a 12% bonus. I manage globally distributed teams and bring the technical depth to review Lucene-level work. I have competing EM offers from [MongoDB/Databricks] with stronger packages." Elastic will counter at $335K-$375K RSUs — accept at $350K+ with 10-12% bonus.
