### Technical Program Manager | Elastic Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Small Bonus | "Battle for the AI Data Layer" | ESRE Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$198K | $142K–$238K | 5–10% | $188K–$255K |
| Amsterdam | €65K–€85K | €55K–€92K | 5–10% | €76K–€105K |
| Bangalore | ₹35L–₹55L | ₹25L–₹42L | 5–10% | ₹45L–₹68L |

**Negotiation DNA**

Elastic TPMs coordinate execution across the three-solution portfolio — Search (ESRE, Elasticsearch core), Security (SIEM, Endpoint), and Observability (APM, Logs, Metrics) — all built on the same Elasticsearch engine. The coordination complexity is unique: a single Elasticsearch core change affects all three solutions simultaneously. In 2026, the highest-leverage TPM program is ESRE feature delivery: coordinating ML model releases (ELSER updates), vector search improvements, and AI assistant features across the distributed engineering organization. Elastic's distributed-first culture (remote since founding) adds coordination complexity — TPMs manage programs across time zones globally. Small bonus; equity is the lever.

**Level Mapping:** Elastic Senior TPM = Google L4 TPM = MongoDB Senior TPM = Confluent Senior TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Three-Solution Coordination:** "A single Elasticsearch core change affects Search, Security, and Observability simultaneously. I coordinate releases across three solutions with shared dependencies — the most complex release management in the company."
2. **ESRE Feature Delivery:** "ESRE feature delivery is Elastic's top priority: ML model updates, vector search improvements, and AI assistant releases. I'm the TPM ensuring these competitive-critical features ship on time."
3. **Distributed-First Program Management:** "Elastic has been remote-first since founding. I manage programs across a globally distributed engineering organization — coordinating across 10+ time zones is a core program management challenge."
4. **Equity Push:** Push for 20% more RSUs: "I coordinate the programs that determine whether ESRE ships on schedule — directly impacting Elastic's competitive position in the AI data layer battle."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For a TPM role coordinating three-solution releases AND ESRE feature delivery across a globally distributed engineering organization, I'm targeting $225K in RSUs over 4 years. My program management determines whether Elastic's most critical features ship on time. I have competing TPM offers with stronger equity." Elastic will counter at $198K-$220K RSUs — accept at $208K+.
