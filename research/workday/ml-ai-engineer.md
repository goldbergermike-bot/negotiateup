### ML/AI Engineer | Workday Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced (Base + Equity + Bonus) | No-Cliff Quarterly Vesting | Day-1 Liquidity | **+15-25% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Pleasanton | $185K–$228K | $215K–$358K | 15% | $248K–$328K |
| Dublin | €114K–€145K | €118K–€215K | 15% | €153K–€208K |
| London | £122K–£158K | £129K–£233K | 15% | £165K–£226K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Workday are building the intelligence layer that powers the Illuminate AI platform — the system that makes Workday's HCM and Finance applications genuinely intelligent. This includes recommendation engines, anomaly detection for financial transactions, predictive workforce analytics, natural language interfaces for enterprise data, and autonomous agents that execute HR and Finance workflows. Workday's $7.3B ARR platform contains the world's largest proprietary HCM and Finance dataset, making it one of the most compelling environments for applied ML/AI work. The **Agentic AI Premium of 15-25%** applies to this role: you're building autonomous systems that act on enterprise data, not just analyzing it. Workday's balanced comp model (base + RSU + 15% bonus) provides three levers, amplified by the AI premium. The structural differentiator: **Workday RSUs vest quarterly with NO cliff from Day 1**, delivering equity from your first quarter — a critical advantage when competing for AI talent against FAANG companies with 1-year cliffs.

**No-Cliff Day-1 Liquidity Strategy**

Workday RSUs vest quarterly with NO cliff from Day 1. Your first paycheck includes RSU value. At a FAANG company with a 1-year cliff, you see $0 in equity for 12 months. A Workday RSU grant of $320K with Day-1 vesting delivers $20K in real liquidity in Q1 — while a $384K grant at a cliff company delivers $0 for the first year. When comparing offers, calculate the "liquidity-adjusted" value: Workday's grant delivers faster real-world value.

For ML/AI engineers, the Day-1 vesting is especially powerful because this is the hottest talent market in tech — you have maximum competing offers and maximum leverage. A Workday RSU grant of $300K with Day-1 quarterly vesting is worth more in real liquidity than a $360K grant at a cliff company where you see nothing for 12 months. In Year 1, Workday delivers $75K in vested equity vs. $0 at a cliff competitor. When an AI-native startup or FAANG company offers more on paper but locks it behind a cliff, Workday's structure delivers real money faster.

**Global Levers**

1. **Agentic AI Premium (15-25%):** "I'm building autonomous AI agents that execute real actions on enterprise data — approving time-off requests, flagging financial anomalies, generating workforce plans. This is agentic AI, not passive analytics. The 15-25% market premium for agentic AI engineering should be fully applied to my comp."
2. **Day-1 Vesting in a Hot Market:** "I have competing offers from [AI-native companies / FAANG] with $350K+ RSU grants but 1-year cliffs. Workday's Day-1 quarterly vesting means I receive $75K+ in real equity in Year 1 vs. $0 at cliff companies. I'm choosing Workday's liquidity structure — but I need the RSU at $340K+ to narrow the nominal gap."
3. **Proprietary Data Moat for ML:** "Workday's HCM and Finance dataset is the largest proprietary dataset of its kind. The models I build here can't be replicated anywhere else — no one has this data. This data moat makes ML/AI work at Workday uniquely impactful and uniquely defensible. My comp should reflect the value of building on an irreplaceable data asset."
4. **AI-Native Company Competing Offers:** Competing offers from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, or Meta FAIR create maximum urgency at Workday. Even a verbal indication of an AI-native company process will accelerate the Workday offer timeline and push equity higher: "I'm in late stages with [AI company] — I need Workday's offer to be competitive this week."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "I'm building the AI systems that make Workday Illuminate intelligent — autonomous agents acting on the world's richest enterprise dataset. I'd like the RSU grant at $340K over 4 years with the Agentic AI premium fully applied, and a base of $225K. Workday's Day-1 quarterly vesting is a genuine differentiator — $340K with no cliff delivers more real liquidity in Year 1 than a $408K grant at a cliff company. I'm choosing liquidity — help me close the nominal gap." Workday will counter at $290K–$320K RSU — accept at $310K+ with guaranteed Year 1 bonus at 100% target.
