**Negotiation DNA**

Wayfair is the largest online-only home goods and furniture retailer in the world, with $12B+ in annual revenue, 22M+ active customers, and a catalog of 30M+ items from 20,000+ suppliers. As a Security Engineer, you protect one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the US — securing payment processing, customer PII for 22M+ users, supplier integration APIs, and the entire technology stack from application security to infrastructure. Wayfair's massive supplier network of 20,000+ vendors creates an attack surface that is orders of magnitude larger than typical e-commerce platforms. The 2027 tariff delay creates a margin protection window in 2026 that makes this the optimal time to negotiate a higher base salary.

**Tariff Holiday — The 2026 Margin Gift**

The delay of new tariffs to 2027 creates a "Tariff Holiday" for Wayfair in 2026 — a temporary window where home goods import margins are protected from the tariff increases that will compress margins in 2027+. As a Security Engineer, your role is non-negotiable for the business, giving you strong leverage: Wayfair's margins are temporarily protected in 2026 because tariffs on home goods imports are delayed to 2027. This margin gift means Wayfair has more comp budget in 2026 than it will in 2027+. Your negotiation language: "I want to lock in a higher base salary during the 2026 Tariff Holiday — while Wayfair's margins are protected. Once tariffs hit in 2027, comp budgets will tighten. The base salary I negotiate now is my floor forever — I want to maximize it during the margin window." Push aggressively for base salary over equity during the Tariff Holiday because base is permanent while Wayfair's equity may face pressure when tariff costs compress margins. Frame it as: "The 2026 Margin Gift is a one-time negotiation window. My base salary locked in now persists through 2027+ tariff headwinds — I'm negotiating for permanent comp during a temporary margin advantage." Security is a cost-of-doing-business function that cannot be cut even during margin compression — which means your role survives tariff headwinds, and your base salary locked in now is truly permanent.

**Global Levers**

1. **Tariff Holiday — Lock In Higher Base:** "Wayfair's 2026 Tariff Holiday protects margins and creates budget room. Security is non-negotiable — my base salary locked in during the margin window is permanent comp. Even when 2027 tariffs compress margins, security budgets are the last to be cut."
2. **$12B+ Home Goods Scale:** "Securing a $12B+ e-commerce platform processing millions of transactions and storing PII for 22M+ customers requires enterprise-grade security expertise. The scale of Wayfair's security challenge demands premium comp."
3. **30M+ Product Catalog:** "The 20,000+ supplier integration network creates a massive attack surface — each supplier API, data feed, and integration point is a potential vulnerability. Securing this supply chain integration layer is a unique and complex challenge."
4. **Compliance & Regulatory Requirements:** "Wayfair must comply with PCI-DSS, GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory frameworks. Security engineers who can navigate compliance requirements while building scalable security infrastructure command a significant market premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $192K base (maximizing base during the Tariff Holiday) and $65K RSUs over 4 years for this Security Engineer position. Wayfair's 2026 margin protection from the tariff delay creates a window to invest in security talent at premium base rates — and security is non-negotiable even when tariffs hit in 2027, so my base salary locked in now is truly permanent comp. I have competing offers from CrowdStrike at $265K TC / Palo Alto Networks at $258K TC." Accept at $182K+ base and $58K+ RSUs.
