### ML/AI Engineer | Wayfair Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + RSU + Bonus | Home Goods & Furniture E-Commerce | 2026 Tariff Holiday Margin Protection | +15-25% AI Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boston | $168K–$228K | $55K–$85K | 10–15% | $218K–$305K |
| New York | $176K–$239K | $58K–$89K | 10–15% | $229K–$320K |
| Remote US | $151K–$205K | $46K–$72K | 10–15% | $196K–$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Wayfair is the largest online-only home goods and furniture retailer in the world, with $12B+ in annual revenue, 22M+ active customers, and a catalog of 30M+ items from 20,000+ suppliers. As an ML/AI Engineer, you build the machine learning systems that power Wayfair's most critical business capabilities — product recommendations driving conversion across 30M+ SKUs, visual search enabling customers to find furniture by image, dynamic pricing algorithms optimizing margins across 20,000+ suppliers, and demand forecasting models that drive supply chain efficiency. The 2027 tariff delay creates a margin protection window in 2026 that makes this the optimal time to negotiate a higher base salary, amplified by the +15-25% AI Premium that ML/AI talent commands in the current market.

**Tariff Holiday — The 2026 Margin Gift**

The delay of new tariffs to 2027 creates a "Tariff Holiday" for Wayfair in 2026 — a temporary window where home goods import margins are protected from the tariff increases that will compress margins in 2027+. As an ML/AI Engineer, you have exceptional leverage — the AI Premium compounds with the Tariff Holiday: Wayfair's margins are temporarily protected in 2026 because tariffs on home goods imports are delayed to 2027. This margin gift means Wayfair has more comp budget in 2026 than it will in 2027+. Your negotiation language: "I want to lock in a higher base salary during the 2026 Tariff Holiday — while Wayfair's margins are protected. Once tariffs hit in 2027, comp budgets will tighten. The base salary I negotiate now is my floor forever — I want to maximize it during the margin window." Push hard for base salary over equity during the Tariff Holiday because base is permanent while Wayfair's equity may face significant pressure when tariff costs compress margins on imported home goods. Frame it as: "The 2026 Margin Gift is a one-time negotiation window. My base salary locked in now persists through 2027+ tariff headwinds — I'm negotiating for permanent comp during a temporary margin advantage." As the ML/AI Engineer who will build the pricing optimization and demand forecasting models that Wayfair needs to navigate tariff-driven cost increases in 2027, your AI expertise is existentially valuable — lock in the maximum AI-premium base salary now.

**Global Levers**

1. **Tariff Holiday — Lock In Higher Base:** "Wayfair's 2026 Tariff Holiday margin protection, combined with the AI talent premium, creates maximum leverage for base salary negotiation. My base locked in now persists through 2027+ tariff headwinds — and AI talent only gets more expensive. Lock in the AI premium base now."
2. **$12B+ Home Goods Scale:** "Building ML systems for a $12B+ marketplace — recommendation engines, pricing algorithms, demand forecasting — at Wayfair's scale requires deep ML engineering expertise. The business impact of ML at Wayfair directly drives revenue and margins."
3. **30M+ Product Catalog:** "Training and deploying ML models across 30M+ products from 20,000+ suppliers creates unique scale challenges — cold start problems, sparse interaction data, multi-objective optimization, and real-time inference at massive scale."
4. **AI Talent Premium (+15-25%):** "ML/AI engineers command a 15-25% premium over general software engineers. My specialized expertise in production ML systems — model training, inference optimization, MLOps — represents a scarce skill set that justifies AI-premium comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base (maximizing base during the Tariff Holiday with AI Premium) and $80K RSUs over 4 years for this ML/AI Engineer position. Wayfair's 2026 margin protection from the tariff delay, combined with the AI talent premium, creates a window to lock in ML talent at maximum base rates — and my base salary now is permanent comp through 2027+ tariff headwinds. I have competing offers from Google at $320K TC / OpenAI at $350K TC." Accept at $215K+ base and $72K+ RSUs.
