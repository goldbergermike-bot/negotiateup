**Negotiation DNA**

Wayfair is the largest online-only home goods and furniture retailer in the world, with $12B+ in annual revenue, 22M+ active customers, and a catalog of 30M+ items from 20,000+ suppliers. As a Product Manager, you define the product strategy and roadmap for platforms that must convert browsing into purchases across one of the most complex catalogs in e-commerce — furniture and home goods where visualization, configuration, and delivery logistics create unique product challenges. The 2027 tariff delay creates a margin protection window in 2026 that makes this the optimal time to negotiate a higher base salary, as Wayfair has room to invest in product leadership before tariff-driven margin compression in 2027+.

**Tariff Holiday — The 2026 Margin Gift**

The delay of new tariffs to 2027 creates a "Tariff Holiday" for Wayfair in 2026 — a temporary window where home goods import margins are protected from the tariff increases that will compress margins in 2027+. As a Product Manager, you should frame this margin gift as a strategic opportunity: Wayfair's margins are temporarily protected in 2026 because tariffs on home goods imports are delayed to 2027. This margin gift means Wayfair has more comp budget in 2026 than it will in 2027+. Your negotiation language should be: "I want to lock in a higher base salary during the 2026 Tariff Holiday — while Wayfair's margins are protected. Once tariffs hit in 2027, comp budgets will tighten. The base salary I negotiate now is my floor forever — I want to maximize it during the margin window." Push for base salary over equity during the Tariff Holiday because base is permanent while Wayfair's equity may be pressured when tariff costs hit margins on imported home goods. Frame it as: "The 2026 Margin Gift is a one-time negotiation window. My base salary locked in now persists through 2027+ tariff headwinds — I'm negotiating for permanent comp during a temporary margin advantage." As the PM who will need to navigate product strategy through tariff-driven pricing and supplier changes in 2027, your strategic value is at a premium — lock in the base now.
