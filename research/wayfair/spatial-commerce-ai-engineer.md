### Spatial Commerce AI Engineer | Wayfair Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Balanced Base + RSU + Bonus | Home Goods & Furniture E-Commerce | 2026 Tariff Holiday Margin Protection | +20-30% AI Premium | SIGNATURE ROLE — AR/3D/Spatial Computing

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Boston | $188K–$255K | $62K–$98K | 10–15% | $245K–$342K |
| New York | $197K–$268K | $65K–$103K | 10–15% | $257K–$359K |
| Remote US | $169K–$230K | $52K–$83K | 10–15% | $221K–$308K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Wayfair is the largest online-only home goods and furniture retailer in the world, with $12B+ in annual revenue, 22M+ active customers, and a catalog of 30M+ items from 20,000+ suppliers. The Spatial Commerce AI Engineer is Wayfair's SIGNATURE technical role — the intersection of AI, AR/VR, 3D modeling, and spatial computing applied to the home goods shopping experience. This role builds the systems that let customers visualize furniture in their rooms using AR, generate photorealistic 3D product models from 2D images, power visual search for furniture discovery, enable AI-powered room planning and interior design tools, and drive spatial computing experiences for the Apple Vision Pro and other spatial platforms. No other e-commerce company has the combination of 30M+ physical products that must be visualized in 3D and the AI/AR investment to make spatial commerce real. The 2027 tariff delay creates a margin protection window in 2026 that makes this the optimal time to negotiate a maximum base salary for this ultra-premium role — the +20-30% AI Premium for spatial AI talent compounds with the Tariff Holiday margin gift.

**Tariff Holiday — The 2026 Margin Gift**

The delay of new tariffs to 2027 creates a "Tariff Holiday" for Wayfair in 2026 — a temporary window where home goods import margins are protected from the tariff increases that will compress margins in 2027+. As a Spatial Commerce AI Engineer in Wayfair's signature role, you have MAXIMUM negotiation leverage — the AI Premium, spatial computing scarcity, and Tariff Holiday all compound: Wayfair's margins are temporarily protected in 2026 because tariffs on home goods imports are delayed to 2027. This margin gift means Wayfair has more comp budget in 2026 than it will in 2027+. Your negotiation language: "I want to lock in a higher base salary during the 2026 Tariff Holiday — while Wayfair's margins are protected. Once tariffs hit in 2027, comp budgets will tighten. The base salary I negotiate now is my floor forever — I want to maximize it during the margin window." Push aggressively for base salary over equity during the Tariff Holiday because base is permanent while Wayfair's equity will face direct pressure when tariff costs compress margins on the imported furniture and home goods that ARE the products you're building 3D/AR experiences for. Frame it as: "The 2026 Margin Gift is a one-time negotiation window. My base salary locked in now persists through 2027+ tariff headwinds — I'm negotiating for permanent comp during a temporary margin advantage." As the Spatial Commerce AI Engineer who is building the future of how customers experience home goods — AR room visualization, 3D product models, visual search, AI room planning — you are the most differentiated technical hire Wayfair can make. Spatial AI talent that understands both computer vision and commerce is exceptionally scarce. Lock in the absolute maximum base salary during the 2026 Tariff Holiday.

**Global Levers**

1. **Tariff Holiday — Lock In Higher Base:** "Wayfair's 2026 Tariff Holiday margin protection, combined with the 20-30% spatial AI premium, creates the ultimate leverage window for base salary maximization. My base locked in now persists through 2027+ tariff headwinds — and spatial AI talent is the scarcest hire in the market. This is the one-time window to lock in premium base for Wayfair's signature AI role."
2. **$12B+ Home Goods Scale:** "Wayfair is the only $12B+ retailer with 30M+ physical products that must be experienced through AR, 3D, and spatial computing. Building spatial commerce AI at this scale — photorealistic 3D models, AR room placement, visual search — is a problem that exists nowhere else at this magnitude."
3. **30M+ Product Catalog:** "Generating 3D models, enabling AR visualization, and powering visual search across 30M+ home goods products is an unprecedented spatial AI challenge. The scale of Wayfair's catalog makes this the most complex spatial commerce problem in the industry — and the engineer who solves it should be compensated accordingly."
4. **Spatial AI Talent Scarcity (+20-30% Premium):** "Engineers with production experience in AR room visualization, 3D reconstruction from 2D images, visual search, spatial computing (Vision Pro), AND e-commerce product understanding are extraordinarily rare. This intersection of spatial AI, computer vision, and commerce commands a 20-30% premium over standard ML/AI roles — and the talent pool is tiny."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $252K base (maximizing base during the Tariff Holiday with the spatial AI premium) and $95K RSUs over 4 years for this Spatial Commerce AI Engineer position — Wayfair's signature technical role. The 2026 Tariff Holiday margin protection, combined with the extreme scarcity of spatial AI talent who understand both AR/3D/computer vision and commerce, creates a unique window to lock in premium base comp. My base salary now is permanent — it persists through 2027+ tariff headwinds while my spatial AI expertise only becomes more valuable. I have competing offers from Apple Vision Pro team at $380K TC / Meta Reality Labs at $365K TC." Accept at $240K+ base and $85K+ RSUs.
