### Data Scientist — Boku Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Boku's Wallet-First transformation, translating the 3.3B+ wallet connectivity and 50% e-commerce spend milestone into a Data Scientist compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and Mumbai markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £65,000-£100,000 | £20,000-£55,000 | £85,000-£155,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $140,000-$200,000 | $50,000-$120,000 | $190,000-$320,000 |
| Mumbai (INR) | ₹18,00,000-₹35,00,000 | ₹6,00,000-₹15,00,000 | ₹24,00,000-₹50,00,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Data Scientist at Boku extracts actionable intelligence from one of the most unique transaction datasets in global payments — billions of wallet and carrier billing transactions spanning 70+ countries, dozens of wallet providers, and Tier-1 merchants including Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), Boku's data science function is pivotal to the wallet-first transformation: understanding wallet adoption curves, optimizing authorization rates across heterogeneous wallet APIs, predicting churn by wallet segment, and building fraud detection models for new wallet markets. With wallets now representing 50% of global e-commerce spend, the data scientist's work directly informs Boku's strategic decisions about which wallet markets to enter, which integrations to prioritize, and how to maximize transaction success rates for Tier-1 merchants.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Analyst/Scientist | Data Scientist |
| Data Scientist (Senior scope) | Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist |

Boku's data science function is lean, meaning each data scientist works across the full stack — from SQL-level data exploration to production ML models to executive-facing analytics. At Adyen, this breadth would be split across analytics, data science, and ML engineering roles.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's **3.3 billion+ wallet connections** generate a transaction dataset of extraordinary breadth — spanning carrier billing, wallet payments, and identity verification across 70+ countries. With wallets reaching **50% of global e-commerce spend**, the volume and complexity of wallet transaction data is growing exponentially.

For a Data Scientist, the **Scale-Reliability** mandate translates into analytics and modeling that directly affects platform performance. You build the models that predict wallet authorization success rates, detect anomalous transaction patterns, and optimize routing decisions across wallet providers. When Boku routes an Apple in-app purchase to M-Pesa versus GCash versus a carrier billing fallback, that routing decision may be informed by models you built.

The wallet-first transformation creates specific data science leverage: the migration from carrier billing to wallets generates entirely new data domains — wallet-specific failure modes, wallet provider reliability patterns, cross-wallet user behavior, and wallet-to-carrier-billing cannibalization dynamics. You are building the analytical foundations that guide Boku's most consequential strategic decisions. Your models determine which wallet markets Boku enters, which integrations are prioritized, and how Tier-1 merchant SLAs are maintained across an expanding wallet ecosystem.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Unique Global Wallet Transaction Dataset**
> "Boku's dataset — billions of transactions across 3.3B+ wallet connections and 70+ countries — is one of the most unique in global payments. No other company has this breadth of direct wallet transaction data. As a data scientist working with this dataset, I can build models that no competitor can replicate. I'm targeting a base of £95,000 in London."

**Lever 2: Authorization Rate Optimization**
> "Every percentage point of authorization rate improvement I drive across Boku's wallet network translates to millions in additional transaction volume for Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft. This direct revenue impact warrants RSUs at £50,000 over four years — my models literally increase the money flowing through the platform."

**Lever 3: Strategic Market Entry Intelligence**
> "My analysis of wallet adoption curves and provider reliability patterns directly informs Boku's decisions about which wallet markets to enter next. This is strategic intelligence that shapes the company's growth trajectory. I'd like total comp of £145,000+ in London, reflecting that my work drives company-level strategy, not just operational metrics."

**Lever 4: Full-Stack Data Science at Lean Scale**
> "At Boku, I'll work across the full data science stack — from data exploration to production models to executive-facing analytics. At Checkout.com or Adyen, this scope would be split across multiple specialized roles. My full-stack contribution warrants compensation at the top of the Data Scientist band."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at £100,000 base / £55,000 RSU (London) or $200,000 / $120,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on the unique global wallet dataset and direct authorization rate revenue impact. Your accept-at floor should be £72,000 base / £25,000 RSU (London) or $150,000 / $60,000 RSU (San Francisco). Push for a £5,000-£8,000 signing bonus and request a conference/research budget of £3,000-£5,000 annually for payments data science conferences. In Mumbai, open at ₹35,00,000 base / ₹15,00,000 RSU and accept no lower than ₹22,00,000 / ₹8,00,000 RSU.
