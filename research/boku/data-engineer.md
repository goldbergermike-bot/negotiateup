#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £60,000-£95,000 | £18,000-£50,000 | £78,000-£145,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $135,000-$195,000 | $45,000-$110,000 | $180,000-$305,000 |
| Mumbai (INR) | ₹16,00,000-₹32,00,000 | ₹5,00,000-₹14,00,000 | ₹21,00,000-₹46,00,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Data Engineer at Boku builds and maintains the data infrastructure that powers analytics, reporting, and decision-making for the world's largest direct mobile wallet payments platform. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), Boku connects 3.3 billion+ wallets to Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft — generating a transaction dataset of extraordinary breadth spanning carrier billing, wallet payments, and identity verification across 70+ countries. With wallets now representing 50% of global e-commerce spend, the data engineering challenge is acute: rapidly growing wallet transaction volumes, new wallet provider data schemas, multi-currency reconciliation, and real-time analytics for Tier-1 merchant dashboards. The Data Engineer is building the data backbone that enables Boku to operate, optimize, and grow its wallet-first platform.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data Engineer |
| Data Engineer (Senior scope) | Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer |

Boku's data engineering function is lean — often 2-4 data engineers managing the entire data platform (ETL pipelines, data warehouse, real-time streaming, reporting infrastructure). At Adyen, this is a 15-25 person data platform team. Boku's data engineer owns the full data lifecycle, from ingestion to warehousing to serving analytics consumers.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's **3.3 billion+ wallet connections** generate transaction data across dozens of wallet providers, hundreds of merchant integrations, and 70+ countries. With wallets at **50% of global e-commerce spend**, wallet transaction volume is the fastest-growing segment of Boku's data — requiring new ingestion pipelines, new data models, and new real-time processing capabilities.

For a Data Engineer, the **Scale-Reliability** mandate means building data infrastructure that is as reliable as the payment infrastructure it supports. When Apple's payments team queries Boku's merchant analytics dashboard, the data must be accurate, timely, and complete. When Boku's internal teams analyze wallet authorization rates to optimize routing decisions, they depend on data pipelines you built. Data quality failures in a payments context are not just inconvenient — they can lead to incorrect reconciliation, regulatory reporting errors, and merchant trust erosion.

The wallet-first transformation creates specific data engineering leverage: each new wallet provider introduces new data schemas, new event types, and new reconciliation requirements. You are building data pipelines that must handle heterogeneous, high-volume, multi-currency, multi-timezone transaction data while maintaining financial-grade accuracy. This is data engineering at the intersection of scale, reliability, and regulatory compliance — a uniquely demanding combination.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Financial-Grade Data Infrastructure**
> "I'll be building data pipelines for a payments platform where data accuracy isn't a metric — it's a regulatory requirement. Incorrect reconciliation data can trigger PCI compliance issues and merchant disputes. This financial-grade data reliability mandate warrants a base of £90,000 in London."

**Lever 2: Full-Stack Data Platform Ownership**
> "At Boku's lean scale, I'll own the complete data platform — ETL pipelines, data warehouse, real-time streaming, and analytics serving layer. At Adyen, this scope spans 15-25 data engineers. I'd like RSUs at £45,000 over four years to reflect this compressed, full-stack ownership."

**Lever 3: Wallet Transaction Data Explosion**
> "With wallets at 50% of global e-commerce spend and accelerating, Boku's wallet transaction data volume is growing faster than any other segment. I'll be scaling data infrastructure to handle this growth while maintaining financial-grade accuracy. Total comp of £135,000+ in London reflects this scaling challenge."

**Lever 4: Merchant Analytics Revenue Enablement**
> "The analytics dashboards and reports I power are what Tier-1 merchants like Apple and Netflix use to evaluate Boku's performance. High-quality, timely analytics directly support merchant retention and expansion. My data engineering is revenue-enabling work that warrants top-of-band compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at £95,000 base / £50,000 RSU (London) or $195,000 / $110,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on financial-grade data infrastructure ownership and full-stack data platform scope. Your accept-at floor should be £68,000 base / £22,000 RSU (London) or $145,000 / $55,000 RSU (San Francisco). Push for a signing bonus of £5,000-£8,000 and request a professional development budget for data engineering certifications. In Mumbai, open at ₹32,00,000 base / ₹14,00,000 RSU and accept no lower than ₹20,00,000 / ₹7,00,000 RSU.
