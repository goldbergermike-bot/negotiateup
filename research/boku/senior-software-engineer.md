#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £75,000-£110,000 | £35,000-£75,000 | £110,000-£185,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $160,000-$210,000 | $70,000-$150,000 | $230,000-$360,000 |
| Mumbai (INR) | ₹25,00,000-₹42,00,000 | ₹10,00,000-₹20,00,000 | ₹35,00,000-₹62,00,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Senior Software Engineer at Boku is the technical backbone of the wallet-first platform transformation. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), Boku connects over 3.3 billion mobile wallets to Tier-1 merchants — Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft — and senior engineers own the critical integration, reliability, and scaling decisions that make this connectivity possible. With wallets representing 50% of global e-commerce spend, Boku's senior engineers are the architects of the infrastructure layer that routes an accelerating share of the world's digital commerce. The role demands deep systems thinking, multi-region reliability engineering, and the ability to design APIs that serve heterogeneous wallet ecosystems across dozens of countries. Compensation should reflect both the technical complexity and the disproportionate ownership that comes with a lean, high-impact engineering organization.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Senior Software Engineer | Senior Software Engineer | Senior Engineer | Senior Developer | L3 |
| Senior Software Engineer (Staff scope) | Senior Software Engineer+ | Staff Engineer | Lead Developer | L3-L4 |

At Boku, Senior Software Engineers frequently operate at scope equivalent to Staff-level roles at larger payments companies. The lean team structure means senior engineers own entire integration domains — e.g., a single senior engineer may own the complete M-Pesa or GCash wallet integration pipeline, whereas at Adyen this would be a multi-person team effort. This scope compression is a key negotiation lever.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's **3.3 billion+ wallet connections** represent the most extensive direct wallet connectivity layer in global payments middleware. As wallets have crossed the **50% threshold of global e-commerce spend**, Boku's infrastructure is shifting from a carrier-billing-first to a wallet-first architecture — and senior engineers are leading this transformation.

For a Senior Software Engineer, the **Scale-Reliability** mandate is acute. You will design and own the systems that ensure Apple's in-app purchases, Netflix's subscription renewals, and Spotify's global payment flows execute flawlessly across wallet providers spanning Asia-Pacific, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. A single reliability failure at the senior engineer level can cascade across Boku's entire Tier-1 merchant base — the blast radius is measured in billions of consumer interactions.

The wallet-first transformation specifically elevates the senior engineer role because the migration from carrier billing to wallet infrastructure requires redesigning core platform abstractions. Senior engineers are making the architectural decisions — API design, state management, idempotency guarantees, multi-wallet routing logic — that will determine whether Boku captures or loses share in the wallet payments revolution. This architectural authority is your primary negotiation lever.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Wallet Platform Architect**
> "As a Senior Software Engineer, I'll be designing the core abstractions for Boku's wallet-first platform — the API layer, routing logic, and reliability guarantees that connect 3.3 billion wallets to Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft. This is architecture-level work that at Adyen or Stripe would sit at Staff Engineer grade. I'm targeting a base of £105,000 in London to reflect this architectural ownership."

**Lever 2: Scale-Reliability Blast Radius**
> "A reliability incident in the systems I'll own affects payment flows for merchants generating billions in annual transaction volume. The blast radius of my work — Apple's in-app purchases, Netflix's subscription billing — demands compensation that reflects Tier-1 SLA accountability. I'd like RSUs at £70,000 over four years, aligning my long-term incentive with Boku's uptime and merchant retention."

**Lever 3: Lean-Team Staff-Equivalent Scope**
> "Boku's engineering team is a fraction of Adyen's or Checkout.com's, which means I'll own integration domains end-to-end — scope that maps to Staff Engineer at those companies. At Checkout.com, a Staff Engineer in London earns £120,000-£140,000 base. My ask of £105,000 at Boku already reflects a lean-company discount; going below that would create a significant gap versus comparable scope at competitors."

**Lever 4: 50% E-Commerce Wallet Spend — Growth Multiplier**
> "Wallets surpassing 50% of global e-commerce spend is a structural shift, not a trend. Boku is uniquely positioned as the middleware layer for this shift, and my work will directly expand the wallet connections and reliability that drive Boku's revenue growth. I'd like total compensation of £170,000+ in London, reflecting that my engineering decisions will compound across the fastest-growing payments channel globally."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at £110,000 base / £75,000 RSU (London) or $210,000 / $150,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on the Staff-equivalent scope compression and Scale-Reliability accountability for Tier-1 merchants. Your accept-at floor should be £82,000 base / £40,000 RSU (London) or $170,000 / $85,000 RSU (San Francisco). Push for accelerated Year-1 vesting (e.g., 30% vest in Year 1 instead of 25%) and a signing bonus of £8,000-£12,000 if base is constrained by AIM-listed budget norms. In Mumbai, open at ₹42,00,000 base / ₹20,00,000 RSU and accept no lower than ₹28,00,000 / ₹12,00,000 RSU.
