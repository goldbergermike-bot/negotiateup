### Staff Software Engineer — Boku Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Boku's Wallet-First transformation, translating the 3.3B+ wallet connectivity and 50% e-commerce spend milestone into a Staff Software Engineer compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and Mumbai markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £95,000-£135,000 | £50,000-£120,000 | £145,000-£255,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $190,000-$260,000 | $100,000-$220,000 | $290,000-$480,000 |
| Mumbai (INR) | ₹38,00,000-₹60,00,000 | ₹18,00,000-₹35,00,000 | ₹56,00,000-₹95,00,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Staff Software Engineer at Boku is the most senior individual contributor role driving the wallet-first platform transformation. At a company listed on LSE AIM (BOKU) with 3.3 billion+ wallet connections and Tier-1 merchant relationships with Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft, the Staff Engineer sets technical direction across entire platform domains. With wallets reaching 50% of global e-commerce spend, the Staff Engineer defines the architectural patterns, reliability guarantees, and scaling strategies that determine whether Boku captures the wallet payments revolution or cedes ground to competitors like Adyen and Checkout.com. This is a role with Principal-equivalent impact at a lean organization, and compensation must reflect the outsized technical leadership expected.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Staff Software Engineer | Staff/Principal Engineer | Staff Engineer | Lead/Principal Developer | L4 |
| Staff Software Engineer (Principal scope) | Principal Engineer | Principal Engineer | Principal Developer | L4-L5 |

Boku's Staff Engineer role often carries Principal-level scope due to the company's lean structure. A Staff Engineer at Boku may be the single highest-level technical decision-maker across an entire platform domain (e.g., wallet integrations, identity verification, carrier billing migration). At Adyen, this scope would typically require a Principal Engineer with a supporting team of Staff-level engineers. This compression creates significant negotiation leverage.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's **3.3 billion+ wallet connections** constitute the largest direct mobile wallet connectivity network in payments middleware. With wallets now accounting for **50% of global e-commerce spend**, Boku's platform is the critical middleware layer enabling the world's biggest merchants to reach billions of wallet-paying consumers.

For a Staff Software Engineer, the **Scale-Reliability** mandate is existential. You are the technical leader setting the reliability, scalability, and architectural standards for a platform that processes wallet transactions for Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft simultaneously. Your architectural decisions — service mesh topology, database partitioning strategies, multi-region failover architectures, API versioning policies — directly determine Boku's ability to maintain 99.99%+ uptime across 3.3B+ wallet endpoints.

The wallet-first transformation is particularly consequential for Staff Engineers because you are defining the target-state architecture. The migration from carrier-billing-first to wallet-first is not an incremental refactor — it's a platform re-architecture that requires redesigning data models, transaction routing logic, reconciliation systems, and merchant-facing APIs. As the Staff Engineer leading this effort, you are the architect of Boku's next-generation platform. Your negotiation should position your compensation accordingly — you are not filling a role, you are defining the technical future of a publicly traded payments infrastructure company.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Platform Re-Architecture Leadership**
> "As Staff Engineer, I'll be leading the wallet-first platform re-architecture — the most significant technical transformation in Boku's history. This isn't feature work; this is redefining the core platform that connects 3.3 billion wallets to Apple and Netflix. I'm targeting a base of £130,000 in London, which is still below what Adyen and Checkout.com pay their Staff Engineers for narrower scope."

**Lever 2: Principal-Equivalent Scope at Staff Title**
> "At Boku's scale, the Staff Engineer role carries Principal-level scope — I'll be the senior-most technical decision-maker across entire platform domains. At Checkout.com, a Principal Engineer earns £150,000-£180,000 base in London. My ask of £130,000 already reflects a meaningful discount for Boku's AIM-listed compensation structure; I'd need RSUs at £110,000 over four years to close the gap."

**Lever 3: Scale-Reliability Guarantor for Tier-1 SLAs**
> "Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft rely on Boku's platform for mission-critical wallet payment flows. As the Staff Engineer responsible for Scale-Reliability architecture, I'm personally accountable for the uptime guarantees that protect Boku's most valuable merchant relationships. This SLA-guarantor role demands total compensation of £240,000+ in London."

**Lever 4: Wallet-First Market Timing**
> "With wallets at 50% of global e-commerce spend and accelerating, Boku's LSE AIM stock (BOKU) is positioned for significant appreciation if the wallet-first platform executes well. I'd like accelerated vesting — 30-35% in Year 1 — to align my compensation timeline with the platform transformation milestones I'll be driving."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at £135,000 base / £120,000 RSU (London) or $260,000 / $220,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on Principal-equivalent scope compression and Scale-Reliability architecture ownership. Your accept-at floor should be £102,000 base / £60,000 RSU (London) or $200,000 / $120,000 RSU (San Francisco). Push hard for accelerated Year-1 vesting (30-35%) and a signing bonus of £12,000-£18,000 to offset the AIM-listed compensation discount versus Adyen or Stripe. In Mumbai, open at ₹60,00,000 base / ₹35,00,000 RSU and accept no lower than ₹42,00,000 / ₹20,00,000 RSU.
