### Product Designer — Boku Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Boku's Wallet-First transformation, translating the 3.3B+ wallet connectivity and 50% e-commerce spend milestone into a Product Designer compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and Mumbai markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £55,000-£85,000 | £15,000-£40,000 | £70,000-£125,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $120,000-$175,000 | $35,000-$80,000 | $155,000-£255,000 |
| Mumbai (INR) | ₹14,00,000-₹25,00,000 | ₹4,00,000-₹10,00,000 | ₹18,00,000-₹35,00,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Product Designer at Boku shapes the merchant-facing and internal experiences for the world's largest direct mobile wallet payments middleware. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), Boku connects over 3.3 billion mobile wallets to Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. While Boku operates as invisible middleware — consumers never see the Boku brand — the Product Designer owns the merchant dashboard experience, wallet integration configuration interfaces, transaction analytics UX, and identity verification flows. With wallets representing 50% of global e-commerce spend, the designer's work directly affects how Tier-1 merchants configure, monitor, and optimize their wallet payment flows across Boku's platform. This is infrastructure design with enterprise-scale impact.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Product Designer | Product Designer | Product Designer | UX Designer | Designer |
| Product Designer (Senior scope) | Senior Designer | Senior Designer | Senior UX Designer | Senior Designer |

Boku's design team is exceptionally lean — often a single designer covers the entire merchant experience surface. At Adyen or Stripe, this scope would be distributed across 3-5 designers. The full-stack design ownership at Boku (research, interaction design, visual design, prototyping, usability testing) creates a senior-equivalent scope even at the mid-level title.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's **3.3 billion+ wallet connections** are managed through merchant-facing dashboards and configuration tools that the Product Designer owns. As wallets reach **50% of global e-commerce spend**, the volume and complexity of wallet configuration — routing rules, fallback logic, regional preferences, currency handling — is increasing dramatically.

For a Product Designer, the **Scale-Reliability** mandate manifests in the design of systems that help merchants configure, monitor, and troubleshoot wallet payment flows at massive scale. When Apple's payments team needs to understand why a specific wallet provider in Southeast Asia is showing elevated decline rates, they interact with the experience you designed. When Netflix configures wallet routing for a new market launch, they use your interface.

The wallet-first transformation creates specific design leverage: the migration from carrier billing to wallets requires entirely new merchant experiences — new dashboards, new analytics views, new integration configuration workflows, and new identity verification flows. You are not iterating on existing designs; you are designing the UX foundations of Boku's wallet-first platform from scratch.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Full-Stack Design Ownership**
> "As the designer on Boku's lean team, I'll own the complete merchant experience — dashboards, analytics, wallet configuration, identity verification UX — end to end. At Stripe or Adyen, this scope spans 3-5 designers. I'm targeting a base of £80,000 in London to reflect this full-stack design ownership."

**Lever 2: Tier-1 Merchant Experience Quality**
> "Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft interact with Boku through the experiences I design. The quality of merchant-facing dashboards and configuration tools directly affects Boku's merchant satisfaction and retention. I'd like RSUs at £35,000 over four years, reflecting that my design work protects Boku's most valuable relationships."

**Lever 3: Greenfield Wallet-First UX**
> "The wallet-first transformation means I'm designing entirely new experiences — not iterating on legacy carrier billing interfaces. This is greenfield design work that will define Boku's merchant UX for the next decade. I'd like a total comp of £115,000+ in London to reflect the foundational nature of this work."

**Lever 4: Design-Led Scale-Reliability**
> "At 3.3 billion wallet connections, the observability and configuration tools I design are Scale-Reliability tools. When a wallet integration is degraded, the dashboard I design is the first thing the merchant sees. Good design here reduces support tickets, accelerates incident resolution, and strengthens Tier-1 merchant trust. This is design with direct revenue impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at £85,000 base / £40,000 RSU (London) or $175,000 / $80,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on full-stack design ownership and greenfield wallet-first UX foundations. Your accept-at floor should be £62,000 base / £18,000 RSU (London) or $130,000 / $40,000 RSU (San Francisco). If base is constrained, push for a £4,000-£7,000 signing bonus and request a design tool/conference budget of £3,000-£5,000 annually. In Mumbai, open at ₹25,00,000 base / ₹10,00,000 RSU and accept no lower than ₹16,00,000 / ₹5,00,000 RSU.
