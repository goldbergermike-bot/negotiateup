#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £75,000-£115,000 | £30,000-£70,000 | £105,000-£185,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The ML/AI Engineer at Boku builds the intelligent systems that optimize, protect, and scale the world's largest direct mobile wallet payments platform. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), Boku connects 3.3 billion+ wallets to Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. The ML/AI Engineer's domain spans transaction routing optimization, fraud detection, wallet authorization prediction, anomaly detection, and identity verification — all powered by one of the most unique transaction datasets in global payments. With wallets representing 50% of global e-commerce spend, ML/AI capabilities are the differentiator that transforms Boku from a connectivity middleware into an intelligent payments orchestration platform. This is applied ML with direct revenue and reliability impact at financial-grade stakes.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| ML/AI Engineer | ML Engineer | ML Engineer | ML Engineer | ML Engineer |
| ML/AI Engineer (Senior scope) | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer |

Boku's ML/AI function is nascent and high-leverage — each ML engineer has the opportunity to build foundational models that become the core intelligence layer of the platform. At Adyen, the ML team is 20-40 engineers with specialized sub-teams for fraud, routing, and analytics. At Boku, a single ML/AI engineer may build the first production routing model, the first fraud detection system, and the first wallet success rate predictor — foundational work with outsized career and compensation implications.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's **3.3 billion+ wallet connections** generate a transaction dataset uniquely suited to ML/AI: billions of transactions across dozens of wallet providers, 70+ countries, multiple currencies, and diverse merchant verticals. With wallets at **50% of global e-commerce spend**, the data volume and variety are accelerating.

For an ML/AI Engineer, the **Scale-Reliability** mandate translates into models that directly affect platform reliability and merchant outcomes. A routing optimization model that improves wallet authorization rates by 1% across Boku's network translates to millions of additional successful transactions for Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft. A fraud detection model that catches wallet account takeover attacks before they cascade protects both consumers and Boku's Tier-1 merchant relationships.

The wallet-first transformation creates unique ML/AI leverage: wallet payments introduce new ML problem domains that don't exist in traditional card payments — wallet provider reliability prediction, cross-wallet routing optimization, wallet-specific fraud patterns (SIM swap, social engineering, account takeover), and wallet user identity verification. You are building ML models for problem domains that are largely unsolved in the industry, giving your work both commercial value and intellectual novelty. This greenfield ML opportunity on a unique global dataset is your primary negotiation lever.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Greenfield ML on a Unique Global Dataset**
> "Boku has one of the most unique transaction datasets in payments — 3.3B+ wallet connections across 70+ countries — and the ML/AI function is still in its early stages. I'll be building foundational models that become the intelligence layer of the platform. This greenfield opportunity on irreplaceable data warrants a base of £110,000 in London."

**Lever 2: Direct Revenue Impact per Model**
> "A 1% improvement in wallet authorization rates across Boku's network translates to millions of additional successful transactions for Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft. Every model I build has direct, measurable revenue impact. I'd like RSUs at £65,000 over four years — my models' revenue impact will far exceed this equity value."

**Lever 3: Novel Problem Domains**
> "Wallet payments introduce ML problem domains that don't exist in traditional card payments — wallet provider reliability prediction, cross-wallet routing optimization, wallet-specific fraud vectors. I'll be publishing novel approaches to unsolved problems. Total comp of £175,000+ in London reflects both the commercial and intellectual value of this work."

**Lever 4: ML Talent Market Premium**
> "ML/AI engineers with payments domain expertise command premiums across Adyen, Stripe, Checkout.com, and every fintech scaling intelligent payments. My accept-at floor needs to be competitive with these alternatives, or I'll pursue offers from companies with deeper ML teams and larger datasets. A signing bonus of £8,000-£12,000 signals Boku's seriousness about ML investment."
