### Technical Program Manager — Boku Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Boku's Wallet-First transformation, translating the 3.3B+ wallet connectivity and 50% e-commerce spend milestone into a Technical Program Manager compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and Mumbai markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £75,000-£115,000 | £25,000-£65,000 | £100,000-£180,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $150,000-$215,000 | $55,000-$135,000 | $205,000-$350,000 |
| Mumbai (INR) | ₹22,00,000-₹42,00,000 | ₹8,00,000-₹20,00,000 | ₹30,00,000-₹62,00,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Technical Program Manager at Boku orchestrates the cross-functional execution of the world's largest direct mobile wallet payments platform. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), Boku connects 3.3 billion+ wallets to Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. The TPM at Boku is the execution backbone — coordinating wallet integration launches across engineering, product, merchant partnerships, compliance, and operations in 70+ countries. With wallets now representing 50% of global e-commerce spend, the volume and complexity of programs is accelerating: each new wallet market, merchant integration, or platform migration requires TPM-led coordination across multiple workstreams and time zones. At Boku's lean scale, the TPM carries Senior TPM or Program Director scope compared to larger payments companies.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Technical Program Manager | TPM | TPM | Program Manager | TPM |
| TPM (Senior scope) | Senior TPM | Senior TPM | Senior Program Manager | Senior TPM |

Boku's TPM function is exceptionally lean — often 1-3 TPMs managing the entire portfolio of wallet integrations, platform migrations, and merchant launches. At Adyen or Stripe, this portfolio would be distributed across 5-10 TPMs with dedicated program directors overseeing. A single Boku TPM may simultaneously manage a wallet provider integration in Southeast Asia, a carrier billing migration in Africa, and a Tier-1 merchant launch in Europe.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's **3.3 billion+ wallet connections** are the result of integration programs that the TPM coordinates. With wallets reaching **50% of global e-commerce spend**, the pipeline of new wallet integrations, merchant onboarding programs, and platform transformation initiatives is growing rapidly.

For a Technical Program Manager, the **Scale-Reliability** mandate means ensuring that every wallet integration launches on time, within quality standards, and with the reliability guarantees that Tier-1 merchants demand. A late or buggy wallet integration doesn't just delay a feature — it can jeopardize Boku's relationship with Apple or Netflix.

The wallet-first transformation creates specific TPM leverage: the migration from carrier billing to wallet-first architecture is a multi-year, multi-workstream program that touches every team at Boku. The TPM driving this transformation is coordinating engineering re-architecture, product redesign, merchant re-integration, compliance review, and operational readiness simultaneously. This is the kind of company-defining program that, at Google or Amazon, would be led by a Principal TPM with a team of supporting TPMs. At Boku, it's your program to own.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Company-Defining Platform Migration**
> "The wallet-first platform migration is the most consequential program in Boku's history — it touches every team, every merchant relationship, and every market. I'll be the TPM driving this transformation. At Google, this would be a Principal TPM role with supporting TPMs. I'm targeting a base of £110,000 in London to reflect this program-defining scope."

**Lever 2: Multi-Geography, Multi-Workstream Complexity**
> "I'll be simultaneously coordinating wallet integrations across Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe, and Latin America — each with unique regulatory, technical, and commercial requirements. This multi-geography program complexity, combined with Tier-1 merchant launch coordination, warrants RSUs at £60,000 over four years."

**Lever 3: Lean-Team Program Director Scope**
> "At Boku's lean scale, I'm not just a TPM — I'm effectively the program director for the company's most critical initiatives. At Checkout.com, a program director earns £120,000-£145,000 in London. My ask of £110,000 already reflects a lean-company discount. Total comp should be £170,000+ to remain competitive."

**Lever 4: Tier-1 Merchant Launch Accountability**
> "When Apple or Netflix launches a new wallet payment method through Boku, I own the program timeline, stakeholder coordination, and go-live readiness. A single delayed launch can cost Boku millions in transaction volume. This merchant-facing program accountability justifies top-of-band compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at £115,000 base / £65,000 RSU (London) or $215,000 / $135,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on the company-defining wallet-first migration program and program-director-equivalent scope. Your accept-at floor should be £80,000 base / £30,000 RSU (London) or $158,000 / $65,000 RSU (San Francisco). Push for a program milestone bonus of 10-15% and a signing bonus of £7,000-£10,000. In Mumbai, open at ₹42,00,000 base / ₹20,00,000 RSU and accept no lower than ₹25,00,000 / ₹10,00,000 RSU.
