### Software Engineer — Boku Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Boku's Wallet-First transformation, translating the 3.3B+ wallet connectivity and 50% e-commerce spend milestone into a Software Engineer compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and Mumbai markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £55,000-£80,000 | £20,000-£45,000 | £75,000-£125,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $120,000-$165,000 | $40,000-$90,000 | $160,000-$255,000 |
| Mumbai (INR) | ₹15,00,000-₹25,00,000 | ₹5,00,000-₹12,00,000 | ₹20,00,000-₹37,00,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: Boku's Software Engineer role is the foundational layer of the world's largest direct carrier billing and mobile wallet payments platform. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), the company connects over 3.3 billion mobile wallets to Tier-1 merchants including Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. As wallets now represent 50% of global e-commerce spend, every software engineer at Boku is building the invisible middleware that routes billions in payment volume between the world's biggest brands and billions of consumers. The shift from legacy carrier billing to wallet-first infrastructure means new engineers are joining at the inflection point of Boku's most significant platform transformation — and compensation should reflect this Scale-Reliability mandate.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Software Engineer | Software Engineer | Engineer I-II | Developer I-II | L1-L2 |
| Software Engineer (Senior scope) | Software Engineer (Senior) | Engineer II | Developer II | L2 |

Boku operates with a leaner engineering org than Adyen or Stripe, meaning individual contributors carry disproportionate ownership of critical payment flows. A Boku Software Engineer typically owns end-to-end features that would be split across two or three engineers at a larger payments company. This ownership premium should be factored into negotiations.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's platform connects to **3.3 billion+ mobile wallets** globally — a connectivity footprint that no other single payments middleware provider matches. With wallets now representing **50% of global e-commerce spend** (surpassing cards for the first time in digital commerce), Boku sits at the center of the most consequential shift in payments infrastructure in a decade.

For a Software Engineer, this means every line of code you write touches a **Scale-Reliability** surface that serves Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. These Tier-1 merchants demand 99.99%+ uptime, sub-second transaction latency, and bulletproof error handling across heterogeneous wallet APIs spanning dozens of countries and currencies. You are not building a payments feature — you are building the reliability backbone that the world's largest digital merchants depend on to process wallet transactions for billions of consumers.

The wallet-first transformation creates specific leverage: Boku is actively migrating its platform from carrier-billing-centric architecture to wallet-first infrastructure. Engineers joining now are the architects of this new system. Your negotiation should frame your contribution as building the **Scale-Reliability** layer that will define Boku's next decade of merchant relationships and revenue growth.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Wallet-First Infrastructure Builder**
> "I'll be joining Boku at the exact moment the platform is transitioning from carrier billing to wallet-first architecture — connecting 3.3 billion wallets to merchants like Apple and Netflix. This isn't maintenance engineering; this is greenfield infrastructure work on a platform shift. I'm targeting a base of £75,000 to reflect the architectural ownership I'll carry from day one."

**Lever 2: Scale-Reliability for Tier-1 Merchants**
> "Boku's merchant roster — Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, Microsoft — demands Scale-Reliability engineering at the highest standard. Every deployment I make affects payment flows for billions of consumers. This level of blast radius responsibility, even at the Software Engineer level, warrants RSUs at £40,000 over four years to align my incentives with Boku's uptime and growth targets."

**Lever 3: Lean Team Ownership Premium**
> "Boku's engineering team is significantly leaner than Adyen's or Stripe's, which means I'll own entire payment integration surfaces rather than narrow feature slices. At Checkout.com, this scope would map to a senior-band role. I'd like a signing bonus of £5,000-£8,000 to reflect this immediate, outsized ownership."

**Lever 4: 50% E-Commerce Wallet Spend Tailwind**
> "Wallets now represent 50% of global e-commerce spend, and Boku is the middleware layer that connects merchants to this wallet ecosystem. The growth trajectory here is structural, not cyclical. I'd like my total compensation to reflect this secular tailwind — targeting £115,000+ total comp in London to stay competitive with what Adyen and Checkout.com offer engineers building on similar growth curves."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at £80,000 base / £45,000 RSU (London) or $165,000 / $90,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on the wallet-first platform transformation and Scale-Reliability mandate for Tier-1 merchants. Your accept-at floor should be £62,000 base / £25,000 RSU (London) or $130,000 / $50,000 RSU (San Francisco). If base salary is capped due to AIM-listed budget constraints, push for a £5,000-£8,000 signing bonus and request a Year-1 RSU acceleration clause tied to wallet integration milestones. In Mumbai, open at ₹25,00,000 base / ₹12,00,000 RSU and accept no lower than ₹18,00,000 / ₹7,00,000 RSU.
