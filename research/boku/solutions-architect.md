### Solutions Architect — Boku Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Boku's Wallet-First transformation, translating the 3.3B+ wallet connectivity and 50% e-commerce spend milestone into a Solutions Architect compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and Mumbai markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £80,000-£120,000 | £30,000-£70,000 | £110,000-£190,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $160,000-$220,000 | $60,000-$140,000 | $220,000-$360,000 |
| Mumbai (INR) | ₹25,00,000-₹45,00,000 | ₹10,00,000-₹22,00,000 | ₹35,00,000-₹67,00,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Solutions Architect at Boku is the merchant-facing technical authority for the world's largest direct mobile wallet payments platform. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), Boku connects 3.3 billion+ wallets to Tier-1 merchants including Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. The Solutions Architect designs the integration architecture between Boku's platform and these merchants — defining API contracts, data flows, error handling strategies, and performance requirements. With wallets representing 50% of global e-commerce spend, the SA role is increasingly complex: each wallet provider has unique technical requirements, and the SA must design integration architectures that abstract this heterogeneity while meeting the exacting reliability standards of the world's biggest digital brands. This is a hybrid technical-commercial role with direct revenue impact.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect | Solutions Architect | Technical Architect | Solutions Architect |
| Solutions Architect (Senior scope) | Senior SA | Senior SA | Senior Tech Architect | Senior SA |

Boku's SA function handles Tier-1 merchant integrations directly — no intermediate account management layer dilutes the SA's relationship with the merchant technical team. At Adyen, SAs are often specialized by region or merchant segment; at Boku, a single SA may own the complete technical relationship with Apple or Netflix across all wallet and carrier billing integrations.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's **3.3 billion+ wallet connections** are surfaced to merchants through integration architectures that the Solutions Architect designs. With wallets at **50% of global e-commerce spend**, the complexity of merchant integrations is increasing — merchants want wallet-specific analytics, multi-wallet routing logic, wallet-to-carrier-billing fallback, and region-specific optimization.

For a Solutions Architect, the **Scale-Reliability** mandate means designing integration architectures that maintain Tier-1 SLAs across a growing and heterogeneous wallet ecosystem. When Apple integrates a new wallet provider through Boku, the SA designs the technical architecture that ensures Apple's payment flows remain reliable. When Netflix expands to a new market where wallet payments dominate, the SA defines the integration pattern.

The wallet-first transformation creates unique SA leverage: the shift from carrier billing to wallet-first requires redesigning merchant integration architectures — new API endpoints, new webhook patterns, new reconciliation flows, and new analytics surfaces. The SA is the person translating Boku's internal platform capabilities into merchant-consumable integration designs. This translation role between Boku's engineering and the world's biggest merchant engineering teams is a singular negotiation lever.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Tier-1 Merchant Technical Relationship**
> "I'll be the primary technical authority for Boku's relationships with Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. These merchants' engineering teams look to the SA to design integration architectures that meet their reliability and performance requirements. This Tier-1 merchant-facing technical leadership warrants a base of £115,000 in London."

**Lever 2: Revenue-Generating Technical Role**
> "Every integration I architect directly enables transaction volume — and revenue — for Boku. When I design a new wallet integration architecture for a Tier-1 merchant, I'm creating a revenue stream. I'd like RSUs at £65,000 over four years, reflecting the direct revenue impact of my integration designs."

**Lever 3: Wallet-First Integration Re-Architecture**
> "The wallet-first transformation requires redesigning merchant integrations from carrier-billing-centric to wallet-first architectures. I'm building the integration patterns that all future merchant onboarding will follow. This foundational, reusable architecture work warrants total comp of £180,000+ in London."

**Lever 4: Cross-Functional Bridge**
> "The SA role at Boku bridges engineering, product, and commercial teams — I translate merchant requirements into technical specifications and engineering priorities into merchant-facing capabilities. This cross-functional breadth, combined with direct Tier-1 merchant accountability, maps to Senior SA or Principal SA scope at larger payments companies like Adyen or Checkout.com."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at £120,000 base / £70,000 RSU (London) or $220,000 / $140,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on Tier-1 merchant technical relationship ownership and direct revenue impact. Your accept-at floor should be £85,000 base / £35,000 RSU (London) or $168,000 / $70,000 RSU (San Francisco). Push for a variable bonus of 10-15% tied to merchant integration milestones and a signing bonus of £8,000-£12,000. In Mumbai, open at ₹45,00,000 base / ₹22,00,000 RSU and accept no lower than ₹28,00,000 / ₹12,00,000 RSU.
