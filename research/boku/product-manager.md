### Product Manager — Boku Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Boku's Wallet-First transformation, translating the 3.3B+ wallet connectivity and 50% e-commerce spend milestone into a Product Manager compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and Mumbai markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £70,000-£105,000 | £25,000-£65,000 | £95,000-£170,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $140,000-$200,000 | $55,000-$130,000 | $195,000-$330,000 |
| Mumbai (INR) | ₹22,00,000-₹40,00,000 | ₹8,00,000-₹18,00,000 | ₹30,00,000-₹58,00,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Product Manager at Boku defines the product strategy for the world's largest direct mobile wallet payments platform. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), Boku connects over 3.3 billion mobile wallets to Tier-1 merchants including Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. The PM role at Boku is uniquely high-impact because the product surface spans three distinct business lines: carrier billing, wallet payments, and identity verification. With wallets now representing 50% of global e-commerce spend, the PM is the strategic decision-maker determining how Boku prioritizes its wallet-first transformation, which wallet markets to enter, which merchant integrations to deepen, and how to balance legacy carrier billing revenue with wallet-first growth. This strategic scope at a lean organization translates to Senior PM or Group PM responsibility at larger payments companies.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Product Manager | Product Manager | Product Manager | Product Manager | PM |
| Product Manager (Senior scope) | Senior PM | Senior PM | Senior PM | Senior PM |

At Boku, PMs own entire product domains — a single PM may own the wallet payments roadmap across all markets, or the identity verification product end-to-end. At Adyen, this scope would be distributed across multiple PMs with a Group PM overseeing. Boku's PM-to-engineer ratio creates outsized product influence per PM.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's **3.3 billion+ wallet connections** represent the broadest direct wallet connectivity in payments middleware. With wallets now at **50% of global e-commerce spend**, Boku's Product Managers are making the strategic decisions that determine how the company capitalizes on this structural shift.

For a Product Manager, the **Scale-Reliability** positioning translates into product strategy ownership. You define the reliability requirements, uptime SLAs, and performance benchmarks that Boku promises to Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. You prioritize the wallet integrations — M-Pesa, GCash, Alipay, Dana, GoPay — that expand Boku's addressable market. You manage the delicate balance between maintaining carrier billing revenue and investing in wallet-first infrastructure.

The wallet-first transformation creates unique PM leverage because the strategic decisions are existential. Which wallet markets does Boku enter next? How does the product evolve from a payment gateway to a wallet orchestration platform? How do you package wallet analytics and identity verification as value-adds for Tier-1 merchants? These are company-defining product decisions, and the PM making them should be compensated accordingly.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Wallet-First Strategy Owner**
> "As PM, I'll own the product strategy for Boku's wallet-first transformation — determining which wallet markets to enter, how to evolve the merchant integration model, and how to position wallet analytics as a value-add for Apple and Netflix. This is company-level strategy work in a PM title. I'm targeting a base of £100,000 in London."

**Lever 2: Tier-1 Merchant Relationship Product**
> "My product decisions directly affect Boku's relationships with Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. I'll be defining the SLAs, integration specs, and product capabilities that these merchants evaluate quarterly. This merchant-facing strategic accountability warrants RSUs at £60,000 over four years."

**Lever 3: Three-Product-Line Scope**
> "I'll be spanning carrier billing, wallet payments, and identity verification — three distinct product lines that at Adyen or Checkout.com would each have a dedicated PM or PM team. This product breadth maps to Group PM scope at a larger company. My total comp ask of £160,000+ in London reflects this compressed scope while remaining below Checkout.com's Senior PM benchmarks."

**Lever 4: Market Timing — 50% E-Commerce Wallet Spend**
> "The 50% global e-commerce wallet spend milestone means every product decision I make is amplified by a structural market tailwind. Boku's AIM stock will reflect how well the product team executes on wallet-first — I'd like accelerated Year-1 vesting to align my equity timeline with the product milestones I'll deliver."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at £105,000 base / £65,000 RSU (London) or $200,000 / $130,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on the three-product-line scope compression and Tier-1 merchant strategic accountability. Your accept-at floor should be £78,000 base / £30,000 RSU (London) or $150,000 / $65,000 RSU (San Francisco). If base is capped, push for a £7,000-£10,000 signing bonus and a performance bonus of 10-15% tied to wallet integration milestones. In Mumbai, open at ₹40,00,000 base / ₹18,00,000 RSU and accept no lower than ₹25,00,000 / ₹10,00,000 RSU.
