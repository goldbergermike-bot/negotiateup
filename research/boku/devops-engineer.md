### DevOps Engineer — Boku Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes Boku's Wallet-First transformation, translating the 3.3B+ wallet connectivity and 50% e-commerce spend milestone into a DevOps Engineer compensation framework spanning London, San Francisco, and Mumbai markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £65,000-£100,000 | £20,000-£55,000 | £85,000-£155,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $140,000-$200,000 | $50,000-$120,000 | $190,000-$320,000 |
| Mumbai (INR) | ₹18,00,000-₹35,00,000 | ₹6,00,000-₹15,00,000 | ₹24,00,000-₹50,00,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The DevOps Engineer at Boku owns the infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and operational reliability of the world's largest direct mobile wallet payments middleware. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), Boku connects 3.3 billion+ wallets to Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft — and the DevOps Engineer ensures this connectivity is always on, always fast, and always recoverable. With wallets now representing 50% of global e-commerce spend, the operational infrastructure must scale to handle accelerating transaction volumes across dozens of wallet providers in 70+ countries. This is not generic DevOps — this is financial-grade infrastructure engineering where a deployment failure can cascade across billions of consumer payment flows.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| DevOps Engineer | Infrastructure Engineer | DevOps Engineer | Infrastructure Engineer | Production Engineer |
| DevOps Engineer (Senior scope) | Senior Infra Engineer | Senior DevOps | Senior Infra Engineer | Senior Prod Engineer |

Boku's DevOps function is lean — often 2-4 engineers managing the entire production infrastructure. At Adyen, this scope is distributed across dedicated infrastructure, SRE, and platform engineering teams totaling 20+ engineers. Boku's DevOps engineer is effectively a one-person SRE + infrastructure + platform engineering team, creating enormous leverage and corresponding negotiation power.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's **3.3 billion+ wallet connections** run on infrastructure that the DevOps Engineer builds, maintains, and operates. With wallets at **50% of global e-commerce spend**, transaction volumes through Boku's platform are accelerating — and every wallet integration adds new infrastructure complexity (new endpoints, new latency profiles, new failure modes, new regional deployment requirements).

For a DevOps Engineer, the **Scale-Reliability** mandate is the core job description. You are the person who ensures 99.99%+ uptime across Boku's global infrastructure. You build the CI/CD pipelines that deploy wallet integration code without downtime. You architect the monitoring and alerting systems that detect wallet provider degradation before it impacts Apple's or Netflix's payment flows. You design the disaster recovery and failover systems that protect Tier-1 merchant SLAs.

The wallet-first transformation creates specific DevOps leverage: migrating from carrier billing to wallet-first infrastructure requires new deployment patterns, new monitoring paradigms, new scaling strategies, and new security postures. Wallet APIs are more heterogeneous than carrier billing APIs — each provider has different authentication, rate limiting, and error handling requirements. Your infrastructure must abstract this heterogeneity while maintaining financial-grade reliability. This infrastructure transformation is your primary negotiation lever.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Financial-Grade Infrastructure Ownership**
> "I'll be operating financial-grade infrastructure that processes wallet payments for Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft across 70+ countries. A deployment failure doesn't just cause a 404 — it stops billions of consumers from completing purchases. This financial-grade reliability mandate warrants a base of £95,000 in London."

**Lever 2: One-Person SRE + Infra + Platform Team**
> "Boku's lean DevOps function means I'm effectively the SRE, infrastructure engineer, and platform engineer combined. At Adyen, this scope spans 20+ engineers across three teams. I'd like RSUs at £50,000 over four years to reflect that I'm carrying the infrastructure load of a much larger team."

**Lever 3: Wallet-First Infrastructure Migration**
> "The migration from carrier billing to wallet-first infrastructure requires redesigning deployment pipelines, monitoring systems, and scaling strategies for a fundamentally different API landscape. This is infrastructure transformation, not maintenance. I'm targeting total comp of £145,000+ in London."

**Lever 4: On-Call for Tier-1 Merchant SLAs**
> "I'll be on call for infrastructure serving Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. The on-call burden for a platform with 3.3B+ wallet connections is substantially higher than typical DevOps roles. I'd like an on-call stipend of £5,000-£8,000 annually in addition to my base, or equivalent RSU uplift."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at £100,000 base / £55,000 RSU (London) or $200,000 / $120,000 RSU (San Francisco). Anchor on financial-grade infrastructure ownership and one-person-team scope compression. Your accept-at floor should be £72,000 base / £25,000 RSU (London) or $150,000 / $60,000 RSU (San Francisco). Push for an on-call stipend of £5,000-£8,000 annually and a signing bonus of £6,000-£10,000 to offset the lean-team intensity. In Mumbai, open at ₹35,00,000 base / ₹15,00,000 RSU and accept no lower than ₹22,00,000 / ₹8,00,000 RSU.
