#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £85,000-£130,000 | £40,000-£110,000 | £125,000-£240,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $170,000-$250,000 | $80,000-$200,000 | $250,000-$450,000 |
| Mumbai (INR) | ₹30,00,000-₹55,00,000 | ₹12,00,000-₹28,00,000 | ₹42,00,000-₹83,00,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Scale-Reliability Platform Engineer is the **SIGNATURE ROLE** at Boku — the role that most directly embodies the company's value proposition and competitive moat. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), Boku operates as the invisible middleware layer connecting over 3.3 billion mobile wallets to Tier-1 merchants — Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. The Scale-Reliability Platform Engineer is the person who ensures this connectivity is always on, always fast, and always correct. This is not a generic SRE or platform engineering role — it is the role that defines whether Boku can credibly serve as the wallet payments backbone for the world's most demanding digital merchants.

With wallets now representing 50% of global e-commerce spend, Boku's platform is processing an accelerating share of the world's digital commerce. Every wallet transaction routed through Boku — an Apple in-app purchase in Indonesia, a Netflix subscription renewal in Nigeria, a Spotify payment in Brazil — depends on the Scale-Reliability infrastructure this engineer builds and maintains. The blast radius of this role is measured in billions of consumer payment interactions across 70+ countries.

This role commands premium compensation because it sits at the intersection of three rare competencies: (1) financial-grade distributed systems engineering, (2) wallet/payments domain expertise, and (3) Tier-1 SLA management for the world's most valuable merchant relationships. Engineers who combine these competencies are among the scarcest in the payments industry, and Boku must compensate accordingly to attract and retain them.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe | Google | Amazon |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Scale-Reliability Platform Engineer | Senior SRE / Platform Engineer | Senior Reliability Engineer | Senior Platform Engineer | Senior Production Engineer | SRE L4-L5 | Systems Dev Engineer II-III |
| SRPE (Staff scope) | Staff SRE / Staff Platform | Staff Reliability Engineer | Principal Platform Engineer | Staff Production Engineer | SRE L5 | Principal SDE |

**Critical context for level mapping**: The Scale-Reliability Platform Engineer at Boku carries scope that maps to Staff-level or above at larger organizations. At Adyen, the SRE and platform engineering functions are separate teams with 20-40+ engineers; at Boku, a single SRPE may own the complete reliability and platform engineering surface. At Google, this scope would be distributed across SRE, CRE (Customer Reliability Engineering), and Production Engineering teams. Boku's lean structure means the SRPE is effectively the Chief Reliability Officer of the wallet payments platform — a role that commands Principal or Staff-level compensation at any larger company.

The level-mapping comparison should be the foundation of every compensation conversation: you are carrying Staff/Principal scope at a Senior/Staff title, and your compensation should reflect the scope, not the title.

#### Why This Is the SIGNATURE ROLE

The Scale-Reliability Platform Engineer is the SIGNATURE ROLE for Boku because it is the role most directly responsible for Boku's core value proposition: **reliable, scalable connectivity between the world's biggest merchants and 3.3 billion mobile wallets**.

Consider Boku's business model: Boku earns revenue when transactions flow successfully through its platform. Every millisecond of downtime, every failed wallet API call, every degraded routing decision directly reduces Boku's revenue and threatens its merchant relationships. The Scale-Reliability Platform Engineer is the person who prevents these failures and optimizes the platform for maximum transaction throughput and success rates.

No other role at Boku has this direct, continuous, measurable impact on the company's top line. A software engineer builds features; a product manager defines strategy; a data scientist builds models. But the Scale-Reliability Platform Engineer is the reason the platform is standing — the reason transactions flow, the reason SLAs are met, the reason Apple and Netflix continue to trust Boku with their wallet payment flows.

This is why the SRPE commands a compensation premium: your absence is immediately felt in the platform's reliability metrics, and by extension, in Boku's revenue and merchant relationships. You are not a cost center — you are the revenue protection and revenue enablement layer of the entire company.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's **3.3 billion+ wallet connections** are the largest direct mobile wallet connectivity network in global payments middleware. No other single platform provides direct API connections to as many wallet providers across as many countries. This connectivity is Boku's moat — and the Scale-Reliability Platform Engineer is the engineer who makes this connectivity reliable at scale.

**The 50% e-commerce milestone**: Wallets now represent **50% of global e-commerce spend**, surpassing cards for the first time in digital commerce history. This is not a temporary trend — it is a structural shift driven by mobile-first consumer behavior in Asia-Pacific, Africa, Latin America, and increasingly in Europe and North America. For Boku, this means:

1. **Transaction volume acceleration**: More wallet transactions flow through Boku's platform every quarter, requiring continuous scaling of infrastructure, databases, message queues, and API gateways.
2. **Wallet provider diversity**: New wallet providers emerge in every market (M-Pesa, GCash, Alipay, WeChat Pay, Dana, GoPay, Paytm, PhonePe, MercadoPago, and dozens more), each with unique API contracts, authentication mechanisms, rate limits, and failure modes.
3. **Merchant expectations**: As wallet volume grows, Tier-1 merchants (Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, Microsoft) raise their reliability expectations. They are not moving more volume to a platform that is less reliable — they demand that Boku's reliability scales proportionally with volume.

For the Scale-Reliability Platform Engineer, these dynamics create the ultimate negotiation position: **you are the architect of Scale-Reliability for a platform that the world's biggest merchants depend on to reach half of all e-commerce consumers**. This is not a nice-to-have role — it is the role that determines whether Boku's business model works.

**Specific Scale-Reliability engineering challenges you will own:**

- **Multi-wallet API abstraction layer**: Building a unified reliability layer across dozens of wallet APIs with heterogeneous authentication, rate limiting, error handling, and latency profiles. Each wallet provider behaves differently under load, and your abstraction layer must normalize this behavior while maintaining financial-grade transaction integrity.

- **Global transaction routing and failover**: Designing routing logic that selects the optimal wallet provider for each transaction based on real-time availability, success rates, latency, and cost — and automatically fails over to alternative providers when a primary provider degrades. This routing logic directly affects Boku's authorization rates and merchant satisfaction.

- **99.99%+ uptime across heterogeneous infrastructure**: Maintaining near-perfect availability across a platform that depends on dozens of third-party wallet APIs, each with its own uptime characteristics. You cannot control the availability of M-Pesa or GCash — but you must design Boku's platform to remain reliable even when individual wallet providers are not.

- **Real-time observability at wallet-level granularity**: Building monitoring, alerting, and dashboarding systems that provide real-time visibility into the health of each wallet provider, each merchant integration, each geographic region, and each transaction type. When Apple's payments team asks "why did authorization rates drop 2% in Indonesia last night?", you provide the answer within minutes.

- **Financial-grade data integrity under load**: Ensuring that every transaction is processed exactly once, every reconciliation record is accurate, and every audit trail is complete — even under peak load conditions, wallet provider outages, and network partitions. In payments, data integrity failures are not bugs — they are regulatory violations and merchant trust breaches.

- **Capacity planning for exponential wallet growth**: Forecasting and provisioning infrastructure for a platform where wallet transaction volume is growing 30-50% year-over-year. Over-provisioning wastes budget; under-provisioning causes outages during peak periods. Your capacity models must balance cost efficiency with the reliability demands of Tier-1 merchants.

This combination of challenges — multi-provider reliability, financial-grade integrity, Tier-1 SLA management, and exponential growth scaling — makes the Scale-Reliability Platform Engineer the most technically demanding and commercially impactful role at Boku. Your negotiation leverage is proportional to this impact.

#### Detailed Global Levers

**Lever 1: Revenue Protection and Enablement**
> "As the Scale-Reliability Platform Engineer, I am directly responsible for Boku's revenue — transactions only generate revenue when they flow successfully through the platform. Every second of downtime I prevent, every percentage point of authorization rate I improve through better routing and failover, translates directly to Boku's top line. I'm not a cost center — I'm the revenue protection layer. I'm targeting a base of £125,000 in London, which is below what Adyen and Checkout.com pay Senior SREs for narrower scope and smaller blast radius."

**Lever 2: Staff/Principal Scope at Lean Scale**
> "At Boku, I'll own the complete Scale-Reliability surface — platform engineering, SRE, observability, capacity planning, and incident management — across 3.3 billion wallet connections and Tier-1 merchant integrations. At Google, this scope spans separate SRE, CRE, and Production Engineering teams with dozens of engineers. At Adyen, it's split across SRE and Platform Engineering teams of 20-40 people. I'm carrying Staff/Principal scope and need compensation that reflects it — RSUs at £100,000 over four years to align my long-term incentive with the platform reliability I'll guarantee."

**Lever 3: Scarcest Skillset in Payments**
> "Engineers who combine financial-grade distributed systems expertise, wallet/payments domain knowledge, and Tier-1 SLA management experience are among the scarcest in the industry. Adyen, Stripe, Checkout.com, and every major fintech are competing for this exact skillset. My accept-at floor needs to be competitive with these alternatives, or the talent market will resolve the negotiation for me. I need total comp of £225,000+ in London to stay."

**Lever 4: 50% E-Commerce Wallet Spend — Your Scale-Reliability Is the Product**
> "Wallets representing 50% of global e-commerce spend means Boku's platform is becoming the critical middleware for half of all digital commerce transactions. The reliability of this platform is not a feature — it is the product. Boku's Tier-1 merchants buy reliability. As the engineer who delivers that reliability, I am building the product. I'd like accelerated Year-1 vesting at 35% to align my equity timeline with the platform transformation milestones I'll deliver in my first twelve months."

**Lever 5: Incident Prevention ROI**
> "A single major outage on Boku's platform — one that affects Apple's or Netflix's wallet payment flows for even 30 minutes — could cost millions in lost transaction volume, merchant penalties, and reputational damage. My annual total compensation is a fraction of the cost of one prevented major incident. This is an asymmetric ROI proposition — every pound invested in my compensation is returned many times over in incident prevention value."

**Lever 6: Competitive Counter-Offer Shield**
> "I want to be transparent: I'm evaluating opportunities at Adyen, Checkout.com, and Stripe, all of which have open SRE/Platform Engineering roles at comparable or higher compensation. Boku's unique appeal is the wallet-first platform transformation and the outsized ownership. But the compensation gap cannot exceed 15-20% versus these alternatives without making the decision difficult. I'd like Boku to close this gap with a signing bonus of £12,000-£18,000 and a Year-1 RSU acceleration to 35%."

**Lever 7: Wallet-First Architecture Pioneer**
> "The wallet-first migration is creating entirely new Scale-Reliability patterns — multi-wallet failover, cross-provider load balancing, wallet-specific circuit breakers, and heterogeneous API health scoring. These patterns don't exist in textbooks or at other companies. I'll be pioneering the reliability engineering playbook for wallet-first payments infrastructure. This pioneering technical contribution warrants a base at the top of band — £130,000 in London."

**Lever 8: Global On-Call Accountability**
> "I'll be the on-call engineer for a platform serving Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft across 70+ countries and every time zone. A 2 AM page isn't about a feature being down — it's about billions of consumers being unable to complete purchases with the world's biggest brands. This 24/7 global on-call accountability, at the highest stakes, warrants an on-call stipend of £8,000-£12,000 annually on top of base compensation."

#### Extended Negotiation Scenarios

**Scenario A: London-Based, Counter-Offering Adyen**
If you have a competing Adyen offer in London at £115,000 base / £80,000 RSU, position Boku's SRPE role as follows: "Adyen is offering £115K base for a narrower SRE scope within a larger team. At Boku, I'll own the complete Scale-Reliability surface across 3.3B wallet connections — significantly broader scope. I'd need £125K base and £100K RSU to accept Boku over Adyen." Accept-at floor: £105,000 base / £65,000 RSU with a £15,000 signing bonus.

**Scenario B: San Francisco-Based, Competing with Stripe**
If you have a Stripe Production Engineering offer at $240,000 base / $180,000 RSU, position Boku as: "Stripe is offering $240K for a Production Engineer role within a massive team where I'll own a narrow surface. At Boku SF, I'll be the Scale-Reliability architect for the entire wallet platform. I need $245K base and $195K RSU to accept Boku." Accept-at floor: $200,000 base / $120,000 RSU with a $20,000 signing bonus and 35% Year-1 vesting.

**Scenario C: Mumbai-Based, Growth Trajectory**
Position Boku Mumbai as the highest-impact platform engineering role in India's fintech landscape: "I'll be building Scale-Reliability infrastructure for Apple and Netflix from Mumbai — this is not typical India-office support work. I need compensation that reflects the Tier-1 merchant impact: ₹52,00,000 base and ₹28,00,000 RSU." Accept-at floor: ₹35,00,000 base / ₹15,00,000 RSU.

#### SRPE-Specific Compensation Components to Negotiate

Beyond base salary and RSUs, the Scale-Reliability Platform Engineer should negotiate these additional components:

1. **On-call stipend**: £8,000-£12,000 / $12,000-$18,000 annually. The 24/7 on-call responsibility for Tier-1 merchant payment flows justifies a dedicated stipend above base compensation.

2. **Incident prevention bonus**: 5-10% annual bonus tied to platform uptime metrics (e.g., maintaining 99.99%+ availability) and merchant SLA compliance. This aligns your bonus with your core job function.

3. **Signing bonus**: £12,000-£18,000 / $18,000-$25,000. The scarcity of Scale-Reliability engineers with payments domain expertise justifies a premium signing bonus.

4. **Accelerated Year-1 vesting**: 30-35% of RSU grant vesting in Year 1 (versus standard 25%). The wallet-first transformation's first-year milestones require maximum retention incentive during the most critical period.

5. **Conference and certification budget**: £5,000-£8,000 annually for SREcon, Velocity, KubeCon, and relevant payments infrastructure conferences.

6. **Home office / remote work setup**: £3,000-£5,000 one-time for on-call-optimized home office (redundant internet, UPS, ergonomic setup for 2 AM incident response).

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at £130,000 base / £110,000 RSU / £15,000 signing bonus (London) or $250,000 / $200,000 RSU / $22,000 signing bonus (San Francisco). This is the **SIGNATURE ROLE** — do not open below market. Anchor on three pillars: (1) Staff/Principal scope compression at Boku's lean scale, (2) revenue protection ROI — your total comp is a rounding error compared to the cost of a single major outage affecting Apple or Netflix, and (3) the scarcity premium for engineers combining financial-grade distributed systems, wallet payments domain expertise, and Tier-1 SLA management. Your accept-at floor should be £95,000 base / £55,000 RSU (London) or $185,000 / $95,000 RSU (San Francisco). Below this floor, the compensation gap versus Adyen, Checkout.com, and Stripe becomes too large to justify Boku's lean-team intensity. Push hard for on-call stipend (£8,000-£12,000), accelerated Year-1 vesting (35%), and incident prevention bonus (5-10%). In Mumbai, open at ₹55,00,000 base / ₹28,00,000 RSU and accept no lower than ₹38,00,000 / ₹16,00,000 RSU. If Boku cannot meet your floor on base, negotiate for a guaranteed Year-1 RSU refresh and a 6-month compensation review tied to wallet-first platform milestones.

#### Role-Specific Interview Preparation for Compensation Leverage

To maximize your SRPE negotiation leverage, prepare to demonstrate depth in these areas during interviews — then reference your demonstrated expertise during compensation discussions:

1. **Multi-provider failover design**: Be prepared to whiteboard a wallet-provider failover system that handles heterogeneous APIs, variable latency profiles, and financial-grade exactly-once delivery. Then in negotiation: "As you saw in my system design interview, I brought production-tested multi-provider failover patterns. This expertise is directly applicable to Boku's wallet routing challenges."

2. **Incident management at scale**: Share stories of managing incidents affecting millions of users/transactions. Then: "My incident management experience is directly transferable to Boku's Tier-1 merchant SLAs — I've managed incidents at comparable blast radius."

3. **Capacity planning under growth**: Demonstrate experience forecasting and provisioning for 30-50% YoY growth. Then: "Boku's wallet volume is growing at exactly this rate. My capacity planning expertise will prevent the over-provisioning waste or under-provisioning outages that companies at this growth stage typically experience."
