**Negotiation DNA**: The Security Engineer at Boku protects the transaction integrity, data privacy, and compliance posture of the world's largest direct mobile wallet payments middleware. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), Boku connects 3.3 billion+ wallets to Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft — and a security breach at Boku would cascade across billions of consumer payment flows and some of the most valuable merchant relationships in global commerce. With wallets representing 50% of global e-commerce spend, the attack surface is expanding: each new wallet provider introduces new authentication protocols, new API surfaces, and new regional regulatory requirements. The Security Engineer at Boku is the guardian of a financial-grade platform where a single vulnerability could have existential consequences.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | InfoSec Engineer | Security Engineer |
| Security Engineer (Senior scope) | Senior Security | Senior Security | Senior InfoSec | Senior Security |

Boku's security function is lean — often 2-4 security engineers covering application security, infrastructure security, compliance, and fraud prevention. At Adyen, this is distributed across dedicated AppSec, InfraSec, Compliance, and Fraud teams totaling 15-25 security professionals. Boku's security engineer is a one-person security department across multiple domains, creating exceptional leverage.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku's **3.3 billion+ wallet connections** represent a massive and growing attack surface. With wallets at **50% of global e-commerce spend**, Boku's platform is an increasingly attractive target for sophisticated threat actors targeting payment flows between global merchants and billions of consumers.

For a Security Engineer, the **Scale-Reliability** mandate is inextricable from the security mandate. Reliability and security are two sides of the same coin at payment infrastructure companies — a security incident is a reliability incident, and vice versa. You protect the integrity of transaction flows for Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft simultaneously. A single exploited vulnerability in Boku's wallet integration layer could compromise payment data for billions of consumers across multiple Tier-1 merchants.

The wallet-first transformation creates specific security leverage: each new wallet provider introduces new authentication mechanisms (OAuth, mTLS, API keys, HMAC signatures), new data handling requirements (PCI DSS, regional data residency, GDPR, India's DPDP Act), and new fraud vectors (wallet account takeover, SIM swap attacks, social engineering). You are building the security architecture for a platform that must be simultaneously compliant with dozens of regulatory regimes while maintaining seamless, low-latency payment flows. This is elite-level security engineering with financial-grade stakes.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Financial-Grade Security for Tier-1 Merchants**
> "I'll be protecting payment flows for Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft across 3.3 billion wallet connections. A security breach at Boku would be headline news and could jeopardize relationships worth hundreds of millions in annual transaction volume. This existential-risk security mandate warrants a base of £105,000 in London."

**Lever 2: One-Person Security Department Scope**
> "Boku's lean security team means I'll cover AppSec, InfraSec, compliance, and fraud prevention — scope that at Adyen or Checkout.com spans 15-25 security professionals across four dedicated teams. I'd like RSUs at £60,000 over four years to reflect this compressed scope."

**Lever 3: Expanding Wallet Attack Surface**
> "Each new wallet provider Boku integrates adds new authentication protocols, API surfaces, and regulatory compliance requirements to my security domain. With wallet adoption accelerating toward 50% of global e-commerce, my scope grows every quarter. Total comp of £165,000+ in London reflects this expanding attack surface."

**Lever 4: Multi-Regulatory Compliance Complexity**
> "I'll be ensuring compliance across PCI DSS, GDPR, India's DPDP Act, and dozens of regional data residency requirements simultaneously — while maintaining the performance guarantees that Tier-1 merchants demand. This multi-jurisdictional compliance-while-performing requirement is uniquely complex in payments and warrants top-of-band compensation."
