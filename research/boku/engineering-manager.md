#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | RSU (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| London (GBP) | £90,000-£130,000 | £40,000-£100,000 | £130,000-£230,000 |
| San Francisco (USD) | $180,000-$250,000 | $80,000-$200,000 | $260,000-$450,000 |
| Mumbai (INR) | ₹35,00,000-₹55,00,000 | ₹15,00,000-₹30,00,000 | ₹50,00,000-₹85,00,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**: The Engineering Manager at Boku leads the teams building and operating the world's largest direct mobile wallet payments middleware. Listed on LSE AIM (BOKU), Boku's platform connects 3.3 billion+ wallets to Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. The EM role at Boku is uniquely high-leverage: with a lean engineering organization, each manager oversees teams whose output directly affects Tier-1 merchant SLAs, wallet integration reliability, and the wallet-first platform migration. As wallets now represent 50% of global e-commerce spend, Boku's Engineering Managers are responsible for the people, processes, and delivery cadence that determine whether the company captures this structural shift. This is a Director-equivalent scope at many larger payments companies, and compensation negotiations should reflect this management leverage.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| Boku | Adyen | Checkout.com | Worldpay | Stripe |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Development Manager | EM (M1) |
| Engineering Manager (Senior EM scope) | Senior EM | Senior EM | Senior Dev Manager | EM (M2) |

Boku's EM role typically manages teams of 6-12 engineers with direct accountability for wallet integration domains, platform reliability, or identity verification systems. At Adyen or Checkout.com, equivalent scope would often be split across two EMs. Boku's lean structure creates a management multiplier — each EM has broader technical and organizational ownership than peers at larger competitors.

#### 👛 Boku Wallet-First & Scale-Reliability Lever

Boku connects to **3.3 billion+ mobile wallets** globally, making it the most extensive direct wallet middleware provider in payments. With wallets reaching **50% of global e-commerce spend**, Boku's infrastructure is transitioning from carrier-billing-centric to wallet-first — and Engineering Managers are the organizational leaders driving this transformation.

For an Engineering Manager, the **Scale-Reliability** mandate translates into team-level accountability. You are responsible for hiring, retaining, and developing the engineers who build and maintain the reliability infrastructure serving Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Sony, and Microsoft. When a wallet integration fails at 2 AM across a region, your team is the one paged. When Boku's Tier-1 merchants review quarterly SLA performance, your team's metrics are on the slide.

The wallet-first transformation creates specific EM leverage because the migration requires not just technical re-architecture but organizational re-architecture. You will be restructuring teams, redefining on-call rotations, hiring wallet-specialist engineers, and building new competencies in wallet API integration across diverse providers (M-Pesa, GCash, Alipay, WeChat Pay, Dana, GoPay). This organizational transformation leadership is a unique negotiation lever — you are building the team that builds Boku's future.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Organizational Architect for Wallet-First**
> "I'll be restructuring engineering teams for the wallet-first transformation — hiring wallet integration specialists, redefining on-call rotations for 3.3B+ wallet connections, and building new organizational competencies. This is organizational architecture, not just people management. I'm targeting a base of £125,000 in London to reflect this transformation leadership scope."

**Lever 2: Tier-1 SLA Accountability**
> "My team will own the SLA performance metrics that Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft review quarterly. This level of merchant-facing accountability — where a reliability failure can jeopardize relationships worth millions in annual revenue — warrants RSUs at £90,000 over four years to align my incentives with Boku's merchant retention."

**Lever 3: Senior EM / Director-Equivalent Scope**
> "At Boku's lean scale, my EM scope maps to Senior EM or early Director at Adyen or Checkout.com. Checkout.com's Senior EM in London earns £130,000-£155,000 base. My ask of £125,000 already discounts for Boku's AIM-listed structure. If base is constrained, I'd like a £10,000-£15,000 signing bonus to bridge the scope-compensation gap."

**Lever 4: Hiring in a Wallet-Talent Market**
> "The 50% e-commerce wallet spend milestone means wallet engineering talent is in high demand across Adyen, Checkout.com, Stripe, and every fintech scaling wallet payments. As EM, I need to recruit in this market. My own compensation needs to be at a credible level to attract and retain the talent Boku needs — £215,000+ total comp in London signals that Boku is serious about wallet-first."
