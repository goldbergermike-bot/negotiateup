#### Negotiation DNA

The Technical Program Manager at Andreessen Horowitz orchestrates the execution of complex, cross-functional platform initiatives for a firm managing $42B+ in AUM. While TPMs at technology companies coordinate product launches and engineering milestones, at a16z you coordinate programs that directly impact investment operations — migrating deal flow systems, launching new fund infrastructure, integrating AI-native intelligence tools, and rolling out cross-fund analytics platforms. Following the $15B January 2026 fundraise, the TPM role has become critical: the firm is simultaneously scaling multiple fund verticals, onboarding new investment teams, and deploying AI infrastructure at an accelerated pace. Every program you manage has stakeholders who include general partners, limited partners, portfolio company founders, and engineering teams — a breadth of stakeholder management rarely found in traditional technology TPM roles. Compensation follows the private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry.

#### American Dynamism — The $15B Intelligence Cost Collapse Premium

Technical Program Managers at a16z are the operational engine of the intelligence cost collapse. While engineers build the tools and data scientists build the models, TPMs ensure these capabilities are actually deployed, adopted, and delivering value across the firm.

- **Deployment Velocity as Thesis Proof:** The intelligence cost collapse only matters if the collapsing costs are actually captured — if AI tools are deployed, adopted, and integrated into daily workflows. The TPM is responsible for this "last mile" of thesis execution. Every program you deliver that increases AI adoption across the firm is a data point proving the thesis, which supports future fundraising.
- **$15B Fund Launch Coordination:** Launching a $15B fund involves coordinating across legal, compliance, engineering, operations, LP relations, and investment teams. The TPM who can orchestrate this cross-functional execution without friction directly enables capital deployment. This coordination complexity justifies premium TPM compensation.
- **Cross-Fund Program Management:** Managing programs that span crypto, bio, infrastructure, growth, and American Dynamism funds requires domain knowledge across five distinct investment verticals. This breadth of program scope is unique to a16z and commands compensation premium over single-product TPM roles.
- **American Dynamism Portfolio Programs:** TPMs at a16z may manage programs that involve portfolio company coordination — rolling out shared infrastructure, organizing portfolio-wide AI adoption initiatives, or coordinating defense tech security compliance programs. These portfolio-level programs create direct fund value.

#### Global Levers

1. **Program-Impact Carry:** "My programs directly enable investment operations and capital deployment. I'm requesting carry allocation of 0.015-0.025% across the $15B fund, with annual refresh tied to program delivery metrics — on-time delivery, adoption rates, and stakeholder satisfaction across investment teams."

2. **Fund Launch Bonus:** "Each new fund launch or major platform migration I manage is a high-stakes, non-repeatable event. I'm requesting a $20K-$35K per-program bonus for successfully delivering Tier 1 programs — fund launches, platform migrations, and AI infrastructure rollouts."

3. **Cross-Fund Complexity Premium:** "Managing programs across five distinct fund verticals (crypto, bio, infra, growth, American Dynamism) is fundamentally more complex than single-product program management. I'm requesting a $15K-$25K annual cross-fund complexity premium."

4. **Executive Visibility and Career Path:** "Given that TPMs at a16z interact directly with general partners and fund leadership, I want a formal TPM-to-Operations-Leader career path, including regular executive exposure and a documented promotion timeline to Director of Platform Programs within 24 months."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $255K base and $195K+ carry/bonus ($450K+ TC). Reference competing offers from FAANG Senior TPM roles ($350K-$480K TC with liquid RSUs) and fintech program leadership roles ($300K-$420K TC). The unique lever is that a16z's TPM manages programs with direct investment impact — not product launches, but fund operations that affect billions in capital. Push for $235K+ base with carry allocation of 0.02%+ across the $15B fund. Request a $40K signing bonus. If they counter below $215K base, negotiate for guaranteed first-year bonus of $100K and formal Director-track timeline. **Accept at $195K+ base and $127K+ carry/bonus ($322K+ TC).** Walk away below $190K base unless carry allocation exceeds 0.025% with per-program bonus structure.
