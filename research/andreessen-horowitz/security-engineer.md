#### Negotiation DNA

The Security Engineer at Andreessen Horowitz protects one of the most sensitive information environments in the financial world. A firm managing $42B+ in AUM holds non-public deal information, LP financial data, portfolio company trade secrets, and investment strategies worth billions — all of which are high-value targets for state-sponsored actors, corporate espionage, and cybercriminals. Unlike security engineering at a technology company where breaches impact user data, a breach at a16z could compromise active deal negotiations, expose LP identities, or leak portfolio company confidential information, each with multi-billion-dollar consequences. Following the $15B January 2026 fundraise, the attack surface has expanded: more systems, more data, more AI-native tools processing sensitive information, and more exposure to defense tech and national security portfolio companies that bring government-level threat profiles. Compensation follows the private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry, and the security premium reflects the uniquely high-stakes nature of protecting venture capital infrastructure.

#### American Dynamism — The $15B Intelligence Cost Collapse Premium

Security at a16z is inextricably linked to the American Dynamism thesis — particularly because the portfolio includes defense technology, national security, and critical infrastructure companies that operate under heightened threat models.

- **American Dynamism Defense Security:** a16z's American Dynamism portfolio includes companies building defense systems, intelligence platforms, and critical infrastructure. As Security Engineer, you must maintain security standards that satisfy government-adjacent requirements — NIST frameworks, potential CMMC compliance, ITAR awareness — because portfolio companies may share sensitive information with a16z during due diligence and monitoring. This defense-grade security mandate commands premium compensation.
- **Intelligence Cost Collapse Security:** As AI collapses intelligence costs, it also collapses the cost of attacks. LLM-powered social engineering, AI-generated phishing, automated vulnerability discovery — the same thesis that drives a16z's investments also accelerates the threat landscape. The Security Engineer who can protect against AI-augmented threats while enabling AI-native internal tools is uniquely valuable.
- **$15B Fund Data Protection:** Protecting the data associated with a $15B fund — LP commitments, capital calls, investment memos, portfolio valuations — requires financial-services-grade security. A single data breach could compromise the firm's fundraising ability, LP relationships, and competitive position. This is existential-risk-level security work.
- **AI Security and Model Protection:** As a16z deploys more AI-native tools internally, the Security Engineer must protect against emerging AI-specific threats — prompt injection, model theft, training data poisoning, and adversarial attacks on investment intelligence systems. This AI security specialization is cutting-edge and commands premium.

#### Global Levers

1. **Security-Critical Carry:** "I protect information assets that directly underpin $42B+ in AUM. A single breach could cost the firm billions in LP confidence and competitive position. I'm requesting carry allocation of 0.02-0.035% across the $15B fund, reflecting the existential importance of security to fund operations."

2. **Defense Security Premium:** "The American Dynamism portfolio brings government-adjacent security requirements — NIST, potential CMMC, ITAR awareness. I'm requesting a $25K-$40K annual defense security premium for maintaining these elevated security standards beyond standard enterprise security."

3. **Incident Response Retainer:** "I want a $15K-$25K annual incident response retainer that compensates for 24/7 availability during security incidents. When a threat actor targets a firm with $42B+ in AUM, response time is measured in minutes, not hours."

4. **AI Security Specialization:** "As a16z deploys more AI-native tools, I want to formalize an AI security specialization — protecting LLM deployments, AI model integrity, and training data security — with a $20K-$30K annual specialization premium. This is the fastest-growing security domain and directly supports the intelligence cost collapse thesis."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $268K base and $210K+ carry/bonus ($478K+ TC). Reference competing offers from FAANG Senior Security Engineer roles ($380K-$500K TC with liquid RSUs), financial services security roles ($350K-$480K TC), and defense contractor security leadership ($300K-$420K TC with clearance premiums). The unique lever is that a16z's security is investment-grade — you are protecting billions in deal intelligence and LP data, with an attack surface that includes defense tech portfolio companies. Push for $248K+ base with carry allocation of 0.03%+ across the $15B fund. Request a $45K-$60K signing bonus. If they counter below $225K base, negotiate for defense security premium, AI security specialization bonus, and carry allocation of 0.035%+. **Accept at $205K+ base and $133K+ carry/bonus ($338K+ TC).** Walk away below $200K base unless carry allocation exceeds 0.035% with both defense and AI security premiums.
