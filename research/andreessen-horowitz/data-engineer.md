#### Compensation Overview

| Region | Base Salary | Carry/Bonus | Total Comp |
|---|---|---|---|
| Menlo Park (HQ) | $205K - $268K | $133K - $220K | $338K - $488K |
| San Francisco | $200K - $262K | $128K - $214K | $328K - $476K |
| New York | $195K - $255K | $124K - $208K | $319K - $463K |

#### Negotiation DNA

The Data Engineer at Andreessen Horowitz builds and maintains the data infrastructure that powers investment intelligence for a firm managing $42B+ in AUM. This is not standard data engineering — you are building pipelines that ingest, transform, and deliver data that directly influences multi-billion-dollar investment decisions. Your data pipelines process deal flow from thousands of sources, integrate portfolio company financial data across hundreds of companies, aggregate market intelligence across crypto, bio, infrastructure, growth, and American Dynamism verticals, and deliver real-time analytics to investment partners who use this data to deploy the $15B raised in January 2026. The quality, reliability, and latency of your data infrastructure directly correlates with investment performance — stale data means missed deals, incorrect data means bad investments, and slow data means lost competitive advantage. Compensation follows the private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry, reflecting the investment-grade criticality of data infrastructure.

#### American Dynamism — The $15B Intelligence Cost Collapse Premium

Data Engineers at a16z are the plumbing of the intelligence cost collapse — without reliable, high-quality data infrastructure, the entire thesis falls apart. AI models are only as good as the data they consume, and the Data Engineer ensures that data is clean, timely, and accessible.

- **Data as Intelligence Foundation:** The intelligence cost collapse depends on having the right data, in the right format, at the right time. When a16z claims that AI is collapsing intelligence costs, the implicit assumption is that data infrastructure exists to feed those AI systems. The Data Engineer builds this foundation — every LLM-powered deal analysis, every automated portfolio health check, every AI-driven market intelligence report depends on data pipelines you build and maintain.
- **$15B Data Volume:** A $15B fund generates proportionally more data than a smaller fund — more deals evaluated, more portfolio companies monitored, more LP reports generated, more market signals processed. The Data Engineer must build infrastructure that scales with fund size while maintaining data quality. This scale challenge justifies premium compensation.
- **Cross-Fund Data Integration:** a16z's $42B+ AUM spans five fund verticals, each with distinct data schemas, sources, and quality requirements. The Data Engineer builds the unified data layer that allows cross-fund analysis — identifying a crypto company that could benefit a bio portfolio company, or an infrastructure startup that aligns with American Dynamism. This cross-fund data integration is a structural competitive advantage.
- **Real-Time Investment Intelligence:** In venture capital, timing matters. The Data Engineer who builds pipelines that deliver intelligence in minutes rather than days gives a16z partners the ability to act on opportunities before competitors. Real-time data infrastructure for investment decisions commands premium compensation because it directly drives deal wins.

#### Global Levers

1. **Data Infrastructure Carry:** "My data pipelines power every investment decision at the firm. I'm requesting carry allocation of 0.02-0.035% across the $15B fund, with annual refresh tied to data pipeline reliability (99.9%+ uptime), data freshness SLAs, and adoption of data products by investment teams."

2. **Data Quality Bonus:** "I want a $25K-$40K annual bonus tied to measurable data quality improvements — data accuracy rates, pipeline latency reductions, and cross-fund data integration milestones. High-quality data directly translates to better investment decisions."

3. **Intelligence Pipeline Premium:** "Building AI-native data pipelines — LLM ingestion layers, embedding pipelines, vector database infrastructure — requires specialized skills that are in extreme demand. I'm requesting a $20K-$30K annual intelligence pipeline premium for this AI data infrastructure specialization."

4. **Data Platform Ownership:** "I want formal ownership of the firm's data platform roadmap, with a $30K annual technology budget for data tooling, third-party data subscriptions, and compute resources dedicated to intelligence pipeline development."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $268K base and $210K+ carry/bonus ($478K+ TC). Reference competing offers from FAANG Senior Data Engineer roles ($380K-$480K TC with liquid RSUs), hedge fund data engineering roles ($400K-$550K TC), and fintech data infrastructure leadership ($350K-$450K TC). The key lever is that a16z's data engineering is investment-grade — your pipelines feed models that influence billions in capital allocation, which is closer to quantitative finance infrastructure than consumer tech data engineering. Push for $245K+ base with carry allocation of 0.03%+ across the $15B fund. Request a $50K signing bonus. If they counter below $225K base, negotiate for AI pipeline premium, guaranteed first-year bonus of $110K, and carry allocation of 0.035%+. **Accept at $205K+ base and $133K+ carry/bonus ($338K+ TC).** Walk away below $200K base unless carry allocation exceeds 0.035% with dedicated data platform budget.
