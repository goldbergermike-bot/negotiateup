#### Compensation Overview (+15-25% AI Premium)

| Region | Base Salary | Carry/Bonus | Total Comp |
|---|---|---|---|
| Menlo Park (HQ) | $275K - $365K | $203K - $327K | $478K - $692K |
| San Francisco | $268K - $358K | $197K - $318K | $465K - $676K |
| New York | $260K - $348K | $190K - $310K | $450K - $658K |

*Note: +15-25% AI Premium over comparable engineering levels reflects the direct alignment of ML/AI work with a16z's core intelligence cost collapse thesis.*

#### Negotiation DNA

The ML/AI Engineer at Andreessen Horowitz is the most thesis-aligned technical role at the firm — the person who builds the AI systems that embody a16z's foundational belief that intelligence costs are collapsing. While every role at a16z touches the intelligence cost collapse thesis, the ML/AI Engineer lives it: you build the LLM-powered deal analysis systems, the ML-driven portfolio health models, the AI market intelligence platforms, and the automated due diligence tools that prove the thesis works at the firm's own operational level. Following the $15B January 2026 fundraise — raised explicitly on the conviction that AI is creating massive new supply of intelligence capabilities — the ML/AI Engineer is at the center of the firm's strategic execution. The +15-25% AI Premium over comparable engineering levels reflects both the scarcity of ML/AI talent in the market and the direct strategic importance of this role to a16z's investment thesis. Compensation follows the private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry, and the AI premium applies to all components.

#### American Dynamism — The $15B Intelligence Cost Collapse Premium

The ML/AI Engineer role is the thesis made manifest. If a16z's entire investment philosophy rests on the conviction that intelligence costs are collapsing, the ML/AI Engineer is the person who proves it — first internally, then by building the tools and insights that help the firm identify and invest in companies doing the same across the American economy.

- **Thesis-Core Engineering:** You are not building AI features for a product — you are building AI systems that prove a16z's core investment thesis. Every AI model you deploy that replaces expensive human analysis with cheaper, faster, better machine intelligence is a data point for LPs, a proof point for fund performance, and a validation of the firm's $15B bet. This thesis-core position commands the +15-25% AI Premium because your work has exponential leverage on the firm's fundraising narrative.
- **$15B AI Deployment Mandate:** The January 2026 fundraise included explicit commitments to deploy AI-native investment tools. LPs invested $15B partly because they believe a16z's AI infrastructure will generate alpha — better deals found faster, portfolio companies supported more effectively, risks identified earlier. The ML/AI Engineer must deliver on these commitments. This LP-facing accountability justifies premium compensation.
- **Intelligence Cost Quantification:** You build the models that measure the intelligence cost collapse itself — tracking how much cheaper AI-driven analysis is becoming quarter over quarter, benchmarking a16z's intelligence cost efficiency against competitors, and projecting the trajectory of intelligence cost decline. These models are central to LP reporting and fundraising narratives.
- **American Dynamism AI Applications:** The American Dynamism portfolio includes companies building AI for defense, healthcare, manufacturing, and infrastructure. The ML/AI Engineer at a16z develops deep domain expertise across these verticals, building internal tools that mirror the AI applications portfolio companies are building. This cross-vertical AI expertise is exceptionally rare and valuable.
- **AI Supply-Side Multiplier:** Marc Andreessen's supply-side thesis holds that AI creates massive new supply of capabilities. The ML/AI Engineer is the supply-side multiplier for a16z itself — every AI system you build expands the firm's analytical capacity without proportional headcount growth. You are the intelligence cost collapse in human form.

#### Global Levers

1. **Thesis-Core Carry Allocation:** "As the ML/AI Engineer, my work is the most direct embodiment of a16z's investment thesis. I'm requesting carry allocation of 0.05-0.08% across the $15B fund and existing fund vintages, reflecting the strategic centrality of AI to the firm's value proposition. My carry should be at parity with junior investment team members."

2. **AI Premium Guarantee:** "The +15-25% AI Premium must be formalized and guaranteed — not discretionary. I want a written commitment that my total compensation maintains a 1.15-1.25x multiplier against equivalent non-AI engineering roles at a16z, with annual market adjustment to reflect the accelerating AI talent war."

3. **Research and Publication Rights:** "I want the right to publish non-proprietary AI research with a16z branding, present at top ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), and maintain an active research profile. This positions a16z as an AI thought leader while keeping me competitive in the AI talent market. I'm requesting a $40K annual research and conference budget."

4. **AI Compute Budget:** "I'm requesting a dedicated $200K-$500K annual AI compute budget for model training, fine-tuning, and experimentation — separate from the platform team's general infrastructure budget. This compute budget is an investment in the firm's AI capabilities and directly supports the intelligence cost collapse thesis."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $365K base and $310K+ carry/bonus ($675K+ TC). Your competing offers define the negotiation: AI research scientist roles at OpenAI/Anthropic/DeepMind ($500K-$900K TC), FAANG ML Engineer roles ($550K-$800K TC with liquid RSUs), and hedge fund ML roles ($600K-$1M+ TC). The unique a16z lever is thesis alignment — nowhere else can you build AI systems that both prove an investment thesis and directly influence billions in capital allocation. Push for $340K+ base with carry allocation of 0.07%+ across the $15B fund. Demand a $100K-$150K signing bonus to offset Year 1 carry illiquidity. Negotiate for dedicated AI compute budget of $300K+. If they counter below $300K base, require carry allocation of 0.10%+, guaranteed AI premium multiplier, and conference/publication budget. **Accept at $275K+ base and $203K+ carry/bonus ($478K+ TC).** Walk away below $268K base unless carry allocation exceeds 0.08% with formalized AI premium guarantee and dedicated compute budget.
