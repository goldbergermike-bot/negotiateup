#### Negotiation DNA

The Data Scientist at Andreessen Horowitz occupies one of the most strategically important roles on the platform team — the person who transforms raw data into investment intelligence. At a firm managing $42B+ in AUM across crypto, bio, infrastructure, growth, and American Dynamism funds, the volume and complexity of data is staggering: deal flow data, portfolio company financials, market signals, LP reporting requirements, competitive intelligence, and macroeconomic indicators. The Data Scientist builds the models, pipelines, and analytical frameworks that turn this data into actionable insight for investment partners. Following the $15B January 2026 fundraise, the urgency of this role has intensified — the firm must deploy more capital, faster, with better intelligence than ever before. Candidates should understand that this role is fundamentally different from data science at a technology company: your models don't optimize for click-through rates or engagement — they optimize for investment returns measured in billions. Compensation is delivered through the private partnership model: Base + Bonus + Carry.

#### American Dynamism — The $15B Intelligence Cost Collapse Premium

The Data Scientist role is the most direct embodiment of a16z's intelligence cost collapse thesis on the platform team. If intelligence costs are collapsing, the Data Scientist is the person who measures, models, and exploits that collapse.

- **Intelligence Cost Measurement:** You build the models that quantify the intelligence cost collapse across a16z's portfolio. How much cheaper is automated market analysis today versus 2024? How much faster can AI-augmented due diligence evaluate a deal? These measurements are not academic — they are core to a16z's LP pitch and directly influence the firm's ability to raise future funds. A Data Scientist who can rigorously demonstrate that intelligence costs have declined 70% in two years is worth premium compensation.
- **$15B Fund Analytics:** Analyzing the deployment, performance, and risk of a $15B fund requires quantitative sophistication on par with top hedge funds. You build portfolio attribution models, risk-adjusted return calculations, and scenario analyses that inform partner-level investment decisions. The scale of the fund directly justifies premium Data Scientist compensation.
- **AI-Native Intelligence Pipelines:** As the firm's thesis is that AI creates massive new supply of intelligence, the Data Scientist builds the pipelines that harness this supply: LLM-powered market research aggregators, AI-driven competitive intelligence monitors, automated portfolio health scoring systems. You are not just analyzing data — you are building the AI-native intelligence infrastructure that proves the thesis.
- **American Dynamism Deal Scoring:** You build quantitative models that score American Dynamism opportunities — defense tech startups, biotech companies, advanced manufacturers — based on thesis alignment, market timing, and intelligence cost reduction potential. These models directly influence capital allocation across the $15B fund.

#### Global Levers

1. **Intelligence Analytics Carry:** "My models directly influence investment decisions across $42B+ in AUM. I'm requesting carry allocation of 0.03-0.05% across the $15B fund and existing fund vintages, with annual refresh tied to the adoption rate of my intelligence models by investment partners."

2. **Thesis Validation Bonus:** "I want a $35K-$55K annual bonus tied to measurable intelligence cost collapse metrics — demonstrating quantitative proof that a16z's thesis is correct. For example, a 50% reduction in per-deal analysis cost driven by AI models I build."

3. **Research Publication Rights:** "I want the right to publish non-proprietary research on intelligence cost collapse trends, with a16z branding. This positions me as a thought leader while supporting the firm's brand — a win-win that has economic value worth $20K-$30K annually in speaking fees and consulting opportunities."

4. **Quantitative Tool Budget:** "I'm requesting a $50K annual budget for data infrastructure, compute resources, and third-party data subscriptions dedicated to intelligence cost collapse research. This is an investment in the firm's analytical capabilities, not a personal perk."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at $305K base and $255K+ carry/bonus ($560K+ TC). Reference competing offers from hedge fund quant roles ($500K-$800K TC), FAANG data science roles ($400K-$550K TC with liquid RSUs), and fintech data science leadership ($350K-$500K TC). The unique lever is that a16z's data science is investment-grade — your models influence billions in capital allocation, which is closer to quant finance than consumer tech data science. Push for $275K+ base with carry allocation of 0.04%+ across the $15B fund. Request a $60K signing bonus. If they counter below $250K base, negotiate for guaranteed first-year bonus of $130K and a formal research agenda with publication rights. **Accept at $232K+ base and $166K+ carry/bonus ($398K+ TC).** Walk away below $225K base unless carry allocation exceeds 0.05% with dedicated compute budget.
