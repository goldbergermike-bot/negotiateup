**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at Elastic (Security) own the SIEM, endpoint detection, cloud security, or threat intelligence product roadmap — defining the features that determine whether Elastic wins enterprise security evaluations against CrowdStrike, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, and Palo Alto. This is a deeply technical PM role that requires understanding of detection engineering (MITRE ATT&CK), SOC analyst workflows, security data models, and Elasticsearch's search capabilities. The open-source dimension adds complexity: every product decision must balance community transparency with commercial differentiation. PMs who can navigate the security market's competitive dynamics while building products that security practitioners love are commanding premium compensation.

**Level Mapping:** Elastic PM = Google L5 PM = Meta IC5 PM = CrowdStrike Senior PM = Splunk Senior PM

### 🏗️ SIEM Market Share & Competitive Positioning Lever
In 2026, the SIEM market is consolidating around a few major players — and Elastic Security's product roadmap decisions directly determine whether the company gains or loses market share. PMs who can define the feature strategy that wins enterprise evaluations, design competitive displacement playbooks, and build the integrations that make Elastic Security the default choice for modern SOC teams are directly driving the highest-growth segment of Elastic's business. Use this: "The SIEM market is a $10B+ opportunity, and Elastic Security's product strategy determines whether we capture a meaningful share. PMs who can define the detection, investigation, and response features that win enterprise evaluations against Splunk and CrowdStrike are directly driving the growth that moves ESTC stock."

**Global Levers**
1. **Security Market PM Premium:** "PM roles in cybersecurity require deep domain expertise — MITRE ATT&CK coverage, SOC analyst workflows, detection engineering, compliance requirements. That security domain knowledge justifies $218K base above standard PM compensation."
2. **SIEM Competitive Win Rate Impact:** "My product decisions directly determine whether Elastic wins or loses SIEM evaluations. Every competitive win is $500K–$5M in ARR. That revenue impact justifies $250K RSU/4yr."
3. **Open-Source Security Community:** "Balancing Elastic Security's open-source community transparency with commercial feature differentiation is a unique PM challenge. I'd like a $30K signing bonus for this dual-stakeholder management expertise."
4. **Competing Security PM Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike PM offer at $210K base / $245K RSU and a Palo Alto PM offer at $205K base / $235K RSU. I need $218K base and $250K RSU/4yr to choose Elastic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to own the product strategy that makes Elastic Security the leading SIEM platform — the detection features, investigation workflows, and AI-powered analytics that win enterprise evaluations. I'm holding PM offers from CrowdStrike at $210K base / $245K RSU/4yr and Palo Alto at $205K base / $235K RSU. Elastic's search-native platform is the superior technical foundation for security analytics, and I want to build the product strategy on it. I need $218K base, $250K RSU/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $218K, I commit to driving Elastic Security's SIEM market share. My floor is $198K — below that, CrowdStrike's market position and equity win."
