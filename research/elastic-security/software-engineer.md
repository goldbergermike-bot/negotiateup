**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Elastic (Security) build the detection, investigation, and response capabilities that protect organizations from cyber threats — powered by Elasticsearch's real-time search and analytics engine. Elastic Security has emerged as a major SIEM and endpoint security contender, challenging Splunk, CrowdStrike, and Microsoft Sentinel with an open-source-rooted, search-native approach to security analytics. As a public company (NYSE: ESTC), Elastic offers liquid RSU equity — a significant advantage over pre-IPO competitors. Elastic's distributed-first culture (no headquarters) means compensation is location-adjusted but the equity component is globally consistent, creating negotiation opportunities for engineers in lower-cost regions.

### 🏗️ Elastic Security SIEM & Cloud Security Lever
In 2026, Elastic Security is aggressively expanding its SIEM market share — building cloud-native security analytics, real-time threat detection, and unified endpoint + cloud security on the Elasticsearch platform. Software Engineers building these security capabilities are directly driving the highest-growth segment of Elastic's business. Use this: "Elastic Security is the fastest-growing product line at Elastic, and SIEM is the highest-revenue opportunity. Engineers building real-time threat detection, security analytics, and cloud security features on Elasticsearch are directly driving the growth that moves ESTC stock price."

**Global Levers**
1. **Security Product Revenue Impact:** "Elastic Security is the company's highest-growth product line. I'm building the detection and response features that win SIEM evaluations against Splunk and Microsoft — $190K base reflects this revenue impact."
2. **Public Company Liquid Equity:** "ESTC RSUs are immediately liquid — unlike pre-IPO competitors. I'd like $170K RSU/4yr to take full advantage of this liquidity while my work drives the stock price through security product wins."
3. **Elasticsearch Security Domain Expertise:** "Building security features on Elasticsearch requires dual expertise in search engine internals and cybersecurity. I'd like a $20K signing bonus for this rare skill combination."
4. **Competing Security Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike offer at $180K base / $185K RSU and a Palo Alto offer at $175K base / $170K RSU. I need $190K base and $170K RSU/4yr to choose Elastic Security."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about building Elastic Security's next-generation SIEM and detection capabilities — the real-time threat analytics that win enterprise evaluations against Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel. I'm holding a CrowdStrike offer at $180K base / $185K RSU/4yr. Elastic's open-source approach to security analytics is where I want to build, but I need $190K base, $170K RSU/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $190K, I sign this week. My floor is $172K — below that, CrowdStrike's equity and security focus win."
