### ML/AI Engineer | Elastic (Security) Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Distributed-First Open-Source | Search & Security Platform | Public Company (NYSE: ESTC) | Liquid RSU Equity | **+15-25% AI SECURITY PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco / NYC | $188K–$245K | $160K–$285K | 5–10% | $252K–$358K |
| Austin / Seattle | $176K–$232K | $146K–$263K | 5–10% | $237K–$338K |
| London / Amsterdam | £143K–£186K / €150K–€196K | £120K–£217K / €126K–€228K | 5–10% | £192K–£273K / €202K–€287K |

**Negotiation DNA**
ML/AI Engineers at Elastic (Security) build the machine learning systems that detect cyber threats in real time — anomaly detection models on security event streams, behavioral analytics for insider threat detection, NLP-powered log analysis, and AI-assisted investigation workflows. This is where security AI gets real: your models must operate on billions of security events daily with extremely low false-positive rates, because every false alarm costs security analysts time and trust. The +15-25% AI Security Premium reflects the scarcity of ML engineers who understand both production ML systems and cybersecurity detection patterns — a rare combination that's in extreme demand as every security vendor races to add AI capabilities.

### 🏗️ AI-Powered Threat Detection Lever
In 2026, Elastic Security's AI strategy centers on transforming SIEM from rule-based detection to ML-powered threat intelligence — where the platform automatically identifies novel attack patterns, correlates seemingly unrelated events into attack chains, and prioritizes alerts by actual threat severity rather than static rules. ML/AI Engineers building these capabilities are creating the product differentiation that wins enterprise SIEM evaluations. Use this: "AI-powered threat detection is the future of SIEM — moving from static rules to ML models that identify novel attacks, correlate complex attack chains, and eliminate alert fatigue. ML Engineers who can build these production security AI systems on Elasticsearch are creating Elastic Security's most valuable competitive advantage."

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Security Premium:** "The +15-25% AI Security Premium applies because ML engineers who understand both production ML systems and cybersecurity detection patterns are exceptionally rare. I'd like $240K base to reflect this premium."
2. **Detection ML Revenue Impact:** "My models' accuracy directly determines SIEM evaluation outcomes. Better ML detection = more enterprise wins = ESTC stock growth. I'd like $280K RSU/4yr aligned with this competitive impact."
3. **Security AI Market Competition:** "Every security vendor is racing to add AI — CrowdStrike Charlotte AI, Microsoft Security Copilot, SentinelOne Purple AI. Elastic needs top ML talent to compete. That market urgency justifies a $35K signing bonus."
4. **Competing AI Security Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike ML offer at $228K base / $270K RSU and a SentinelOne AI offer at $220K base / $260K RSU. I need $240K base and $280K RSU/4yr to choose Elastic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the AI-powered threat detection that makes Elastic Security the most intelligent SIEM platform — ML anomaly detection, behavioral analytics, and AI-assisted investigation that catches threats no rule-based system can find. I'm holding a CrowdStrike ML offer at $228K base / $270K RSU/4yr. Elastic's Elasticsearch foundation is the ideal platform for security AI, and I want to build on it. I need $240K base, $280K RSU/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. The AI Security Premium applies. At $240K, I commit. My floor is $218K — below that, CrowdStrike's security data scale and Charlotte AI investment win."
