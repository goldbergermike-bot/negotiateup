**Negotiation DNA**
Solutions Architects at Elastic (Security) design enterprise security deployments — architecting SIEM environments, endpoint security rollouts, and cloud security integrations that protect organizations from cyber threats. The SA role at Elastic Security is uniquely technical: you're designing Elasticsearch clusters sized for security workloads (billions of events/day), configuring detection rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, and building integrations with existing SOC toolchains (SOAR platforms, threat intel feeds, ticketing systems). SAs who can architect Elastic Security deployments that demonstrate superior detection efficacy and cost efficiency versus Splunk and CrowdStrike are closing the largest security deals.

**Level Mapping:** Elastic SA = Google Cloud SA = AWS Senior SA = CrowdStrike Senior SA = Splunk SE

### 🏗️ Competitive Displacement & SIEM Migration Lever
In 2026, Elastic Security's top growth vector is competitive displacement — helping enterprises migrate from expensive Splunk deployments to Elastic Security's cost-efficient, search-native SIEM. Solutions Architects who can design migration architectures, prove cost savings, and demonstrate detection efficacy improvements are directly driving the largest new-logo deals. Use this: "Every Splunk displacement is a multi-million-dollar deal. SAs who can architect migrations that demonstrate 3-5x cost savings while maintaining or improving detection coverage are closing the enterprise deals that drive ESTC growth."

**Global Levers**
1. **SIEM Migration Architecture Expertise:** "My deep knowledge of [Splunk / CrowdStrike / Microsoft Sentinel] architecture enables me to design migration paths that prove cost savings and detection improvements. That competitive intelligence justifies $215K base."
2. **Enterprise Security Deal Acceleration:** "My relationships with [CISO / SOC leadership / Fortune 500 security] buyers directly accelerate Elastic Security's enterprise pipeline — $225K RSU/4yr aligned with deal size impact."
3. **Elasticsearch Security Sizing Expertise:** "Designing Elasticsearch clusters for security workloads — billions of events/day, real-time detection, months of hot data retention — requires specialized sizing and architecture skills. $25K signing bonus."
4. **Competing SA Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike SA offer at $205K base / $220K RSU and a Splunk SE offer at $200K base / $210K RSU. I need $215K base and $225K RSU/4yr to choose Elastic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to architect the enterprise security deployments that displace Splunk and win market share for Elastic Security — SIEM migrations, endpoint rollouts, and cloud security integrations that demonstrate superior detection at lower cost. I'm holding a CrowdStrike SA offer at $205K base / $220K RSU/4yr. Elastic's search-native platform is the technically superior SIEM foundation, and I want to help enterprises see that. I need $215K base, $225K RSU/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $215K, I commit to driving enterprise wins. My floor is $195K — below that, CrowdStrike's market position and equity win."
