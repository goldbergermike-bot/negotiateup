**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Elastic (Security) have a uniquely meta role: you're securing the security platform that enterprises trust to protect them. This means both product security (ensuring Elastic Security, Elasticsearch, and Elastic Cloud are hardened against attacks) and detection engineering (building the security content — detection rules, MITRE ATT&CK coverage, threat intelligence integrations — that Elastic Security's customers rely on). This dual mandate makes Elastic Security Engineers among the most impactful in the cybersecurity industry: your detection rules protect thousands of organizations, and your platform security work protects the infrastructure those organizations trust with their most sensitive security data.

### 🏗️ Detection Engineering & MITRE ATT&CK Coverage Lever
In 2026, Elastic Security's detection content library — the detection rules, MITRE ATT&CK coverage, and threat intelligence integrations — is a primary competitive differentiator in SIEM evaluations. Security Engineers building and maintaining this detection content are directly driving competitive wins. MITRE ATT&CK evaluation results are public and directly influence enterprise purchasing decisions. Use this: "Elastic Security's MITRE ATT&CK coverage and detection rule library are the #1 factor in enterprise SIEM evaluations. Security Engineers building this detection content are directly responsible for competitive win rates — every technique covered is a data point in the evaluation that enterprises use to choose their SIEM."

**Global Levers**
1. **Detection Engineering + Platform Security Dual Mandate:** "I'm simultaneously a detection content engineer (building MITRE ATT&CK rules) and a platform security engineer (hardening Elastic Cloud). That dual mandate is twice the impact — $225K base."
2. **MITRE ATT&CK Coverage Revenue Impact:** "MITRE evaluation results directly determine enterprise purchasing decisions. My detection engineering work is the most visible competitive differentiator Elastic Security has — $260K RSU/4yr."
3. **Security Product Security Meta-Value:** "Securing the security platform that thousands of enterprises trust creates extraordinary brand value. A vulnerability in Elastic Security would be catastrophic for the entire business. That trust responsibility justifies a $30K signing bonus."
4. **Competing Security Engineer Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike offer at $218K base / $250K RSU and a SentinelOne offer at $212K base / $240K RSU. I need $225K base and $260K RSU/4yr to choose Elastic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the detection content and platform security that make Elastic Security the most trusted and comprehensive SIEM. I'm holding a CrowdStrike offer at $218K base / $250K RSU/4yr. Elastic's open-source approach to detection engineering and the Elasticsearch platform's search-native architecture are where I want to build. I need $225K base, $260K RSU/4yr, and a $30K signing bonus. At $225K, I commit to maximizing Elastic Security's MITRE coverage and platform security posture. My floor is $205K — below that, CrowdStrike's security focus and equity win."
