**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Elastic (Security) own major subsystems of the security platform — detection engine architecture, SIEM pipeline optimization, endpoint security agents, and the investigation workflows that security analysts use to respond to threats. This is a deeply technical role that requires understanding both Elasticsearch's distributed search architecture and cybersecurity detection patterns (MITRE ATT&CK, Sigma rules, threat intelligence integration). Senior engineers at Elastic operate with significant autonomy in the company's distributed-first, no-HQ culture, and the liquid ESTC RSUs at this level represent meaningful compensation — senior equity grants scale substantially as the security product line grows.

### 🏗️ Next-Gen SIEM Architecture Lever
Elastic's 2026 SIEM strategy is centered on building a cloud-native, AI-enhanced security analytics platform that processes security events at search speed — orders of magnitude faster than legacy SIEMs. Senior engineers designing the detection pipeline architecture, query optimization for security analytics, and real-time correlation engine are building the technology that wins enterprise SIEM evaluations against Splunk and Microsoft. Use this: "Elastic Security's next-gen SIEM architecture — cloud-native detection pipelines, real-time security correlation, and AI-enhanced threat analytics at search speed — is the product that wins enterprise SIEM evaluations. Senior engineers designing this architecture are directly driving the highest-growth segment of Elastic's business."

**Global Levers**
1. **SIEM Architecture Premium:** "Designing SIEM detection pipelines on Elasticsearch — real-time security event correlation, threat detection at search speed, distributed security analytics — requires rare architectural expertise. I'd like $235K base."
2. **Public Company Security Growth Equity:** "Elastic Security is the fastest-growing product line, and my architectural work directly drives the SIEM wins that move ESTC stock. I'd like $285K RSU/4yr to align my equity with this growth trajectory."
3. **MITRE ATT&CK Detection Expertise:** "I bring deep cybersecurity detection expertise — MITRE ATT&CK coverage mapping, Sigma rule engineering, and threat intelligence integration. That security domain knowledge plus distributed systems skills is rare — $35K signing bonus."
4. **Competing Senior Security Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike offer at $225K base / $275K RSU and a Palo Alto offer at $220K base / $260K RSU. I need $235K base and $285K RSU/4yr to choose Elastic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to architect Elastic Security's next-generation SIEM — the detection pipelines, correlation engine, and security analytics that win enterprise evaluations against Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel. I'm holding a CrowdStrike offer at $225K base / $275K RSU/4yr. Elastic's search-native approach to security analytics is technically superior, and I want to build on it. I need $235K base, $285K RSU/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. At $235K, I commit to leading Elastic Security's SIEM architecture. My floor is $213K — below that, CrowdStrike's equity and security-first culture win."
