| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at Elastic (Security) coordinate the cross-functional programs that span detection engineering, SIEM platform development, endpoint security, cloud security, and Elastic Cloud infrastructure — the most complex program management challenge in the security analytics market. Elastic's distributed-first, no-HQ culture means TPMs coordinate across every time zone without the benefit of in-person collaboration, making async program management a core competency. The security product line's rapid growth creates constant program complexity: MITRE ATT&CK evaluation deadlines, compliance certification milestones, competitive feature races, and enterprise deployment commitments all compete for engineering resources.

**Level Mapping:** Elastic TPM = Google L5 TPM = Meta IC5 TPM = CrowdStrike Senior TPM = Splunk Senior TPM

### 🏗️ Security Platform Unification & Compliance Lever
In 2026, Elastic's most complex program is the unification of SIEM, endpoint, and cloud security into a single platform experience — coordinating across multiple engineering teams, design, product, and go-to-market while maintaining release velocity and compliance certification timelines. TPMs leading this unification program are managing the strategic initiative that defines Elastic Security's next product era. Use this: "The security platform unification program — SIEM, endpoint, and cloud security in a single experience — is the most complex and strategically important initiative at Elastic Security. TPMs who can coordinate this across globally distributed teams while maintaining compliance certification timelines are directly shaping the product's competitive future."

**Global Levers**
1. **Security Platform Unification Program Leadership:** "Leading the SIEM + endpoint + cloud security unification program is the most strategically complex TPM work at Elastic. I'd like $216K base to reflect this program's importance."
2. **Distributed Program Management Premium:** "Coordinating complex security programs across a globally distributed, async-first organization with no headquarters is a specialized TPM skill. I'd like $233K RSU/4yr."
3. **Compliance Certification Coordination:** "Coordinating MITRE evaluations, FedRAMP certifications, and SOC2 audits alongside product delivery is uniquely complex program management. $25K signing bonus."
4. **Competing TPM Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike TPM offer at $205K base / $228K RSU and a Palo Alto TPM offer at $200K base / $218K RSU. I need $216K base and $233K RSU/4yr to choose Elastic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to lead the most important program at Elastic Security — the unification of SIEM, endpoint, and cloud security into a single platform experience while maintaining compliance certification timelines and release velocity. I'm holding a CrowdStrike TPM offer at $205K base / $228K RSU/4yr. Elastic's program complexity and distributed culture are where my skills have the most impact. I need $216K base, $233K RSU/4yr, and a $25K signing bonus. At $216K, I commit. My floor is $196K — below that, CrowdStrike's TPM structure and equity win."
