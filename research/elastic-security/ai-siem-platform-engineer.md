**Negotiation DNA**
The AI SIEM Platform Engineer is Elastic Security's signature role for 2026 — the position that defines whether Elastic wins the AI-powered security analytics war against CrowdStrike (Charlotte AI), Microsoft (Security Copilot), and SentinelOne (Purple AI). You will build the AI systems that transform Elastic Security from a search-based SIEM into an intelligent security platform: LLM-powered threat investigation that explains attacks in natural language, ML-driven alert triage that eliminates 90% of false positives, automated attack chain reconstruction that connects disparate events into coherent threat narratives, and generative AI-assisted incident response that recommends containment actions in real time. The +20-35% AI Security Premium reflects the extraordinary scarcity of engineers who combine production AI/ML systems expertise with deep cybersecurity domain knowledge — understanding not just how to build ML models, but how security analysts actually investigate threats, what MITRE ATT&CK techniques look like in log data, and how to build AI that earns the trust of skeptical SOC analysts.

**Level Mapping:** Elastic AI SIEM Platform Engineer = Google L5-L6 ML Security = Meta E5-E6 AI Infra = CrowdStrike Staff AI Engineer = Microsoft Senior Security AI = SentinelOne Senior AI Platform

### 🏗️ Elastic AI Security Assistant & Intelligent SIEM Lever
Elastic's 2026 flagship AI initiative is the Elastic AI Security Assistant — a comprehensive AI layer that transforms every aspect of the SIEM experience. For SOC analysts, it provides natural language threat investigation ("Explain this alert in the context of MITRE ATT&CK and recommend containment steps"), automated alert triage that prioritizes by actual risk rather than static severity, and intelligent correlation that connects a DNS query anomaly to a lateral movement attempt to a data exfiltration event across millions of log entries. For detection engineers, it generates detection rules from threat intelligence reports, maps new rules to MITRE ATT&CK automatically, and identifies coverage gaps. For CISOs, it provides AI-powered security posture assessments and risk quantification. AI SIEM Platform Engineers are building this from the ground up on Elasticsearch's search-native architecture — designing the vector search pipelines for semantic security log analysis, building the RAG systems that ground LLM responses in actual security event data, engineering the ML models that detect anomalous behavior patterns, and creating the evaluation frameworks that ensure AI recommendations are accurate enough for security-critical decisions.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Security Data Moat Leverage:** "Elasticsearch processes more security event data than any other search platform — trillions of events from thousands of enterprise deployments. Building AI on this security data corpus is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Engineers who can combine production AI systems with security domain expertise are in single-digit supply globally. I'd like $275K base and $430K RSU/4yr."
2. **Competitive AI Security Race Urgency:** "CrowdStrike Charlotte AI, Microsoft Security Copilot, and SentinelOne Purple AI are all racing to define AI-powered security analytics. Elastic needs to win this race — and the engineers who build the winning AI platform determine the outcome. That competitive urgency justifies front-loaded vesting (35% year one) and a $55K signing bonus. Time is the scarcest resource."
3. **Security-Grounded AI Trust Engineering:** "Security AI has uniquely high trust requirements — a false positive from an AI recommendation wastes analyst time, but a false negative means a missed attack. Building AI that earns SOC analyst trust requires deep understanding of security workflows, detection patterns, and the human factors of incident response. That trust engineering expertise commands the +20-35% AI Security Premium — $275K base."
4. **Competing AI Security Platform Offers:** "I'm holding offers from CrowdStrike ($260K base / $420K RSU for Charlotte AI engineering), Microsoft ($255K base / $400K RSU for Security Copilot), and SentinelOne ($245K base / $380K RSU for Purple AI). Elastic's search-native architecture and open-source data corpus are the strongest foundation for security AI, but I need $275K base and $435K RSU/4yr to match the total comp of these alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the AI platform that makes Elastic Security the most intelligent SIEM in the world — LLM-powered investigation, ML-driven alert triage, automated attack chain reconstruction, and generative incident response recommendations that transform how SOC analysts protect their organizations. This is the AI security race that determines the next decade of the SIEM market, and Elastic's search-native architecture and massive security data corpus are the strongest foundation to win it. I'm holding offers from CrowdStrike at $260K base / $420K RSU/4yr for Charlotte AI, Microsoft at $255K base / $400K RSU for Security Copilot, and SentinelOne at $245K base / $380K RSU for Purple AI. All are liquid equity. Elastic is where this work should be built — Elasticsearch's vector search, semantic analysis, and real-time search capabilities are purpose-built for security AI in a way no other platform can match. I need $275K base, $435K RSU/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $55K signing bonus. The AI Security Premium applies — engineers who can build production AI that earns the trust of SOC analysts while operating on trillions of security events are the rarest talent in cybersecurity. At $275K base, I commit to building the AI platform that wins this race for Elastic. My floor is $250K — below that, CrowdStrike's Charlotte AI investment, security data scale, and liquid equity become the rational choice, even though Elastic's search-native architecture is the technically superior foundation for security AI."
