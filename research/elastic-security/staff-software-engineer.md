**Negotiation DNA**
Staff Software Engineers at Elastic (Security) set the technical direction for the entire security platform — architecting the detection engine, defining the SIEM pipeline's scalability limits, designing the endpoint-to-cloud security data model, and making the cross-cutting architectural decisions that determine whether Elastic Security can compete against CrowdStrike's $70B+ and Palo Alto's $100B+ engineering investments. At the staff level, you're one of the most influential technical leaders in the security organization, with your architectural decisions affecting how thousands of security teams detect and respond to threats. Liquid ESTC RSUs at the staff level are substantial, and annual refreshers scale aggressively with the security product line's revenue growth.

### 🏗️ Unified Security Platform Architecture Lever
Elastic's 2026 strategic vision is a unified security platform — SIEM, endpoint detection, cloud security, and threat intelligence in a single Elasticsearch-powered solution. Staff engineers architecting this unification are making the most consequential technical decisions in Elastic Security's history. Use this: "The unified security platform — SIEM + endpoint + cloud security + threat intel in a single Elasticsearch-native experience — is Elastic's most ambitious architectural initiative. Staff engineers who can design this cross-product unification while maintaining search-speed performance at petabyte scale are defining Elastic Security's competitive position for the next five years."

**Global Levers**
1. **Unified Security Architecture Scarcity:** "Architects who can unify SIEM, endpoint, and cloud security into a coherent platform while maintaining Elasticsearch's search-speed performance are in single-digit supply. I'd like $280K base and $470K RSU/4yr."
2. **Competitive Stock Growth Alignment:** "ESTC stock is directly correlated with security product wins. My architectural work drives the SIEM evaluations that move the stock. I'd like front-loaded vesting (35% year one) and annual refreshers at 50% of initial grant."
3. **Staff-Level Security Leadership:** "I'll be setting technical direction across the entire security platform — detection engine, SIEM pipeline, endpoint agent, cloud security. That breadth of architectural influence justifies $280K base and a $50K signing bonus."
4. **Competing Staff Security Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike staff offer at $270K base / $450K RSU and a Palo Alto staff offer at $265K base / $465K RSU. I need $280K base and $470K RSU/4yr to choose Elastic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to architect Elastic's unified security platform — the SIEM, endpoint, cloud security, and threat intelligence integration that defines Elastic Security's next five years. I'm holding staff offers from CrowdStrike at $270K base / $450K RSU/4yr and Palo Alto at $265K base / $465K RSU. Elastic's search-native approach is the technically superior foundation, and I want to build the unified platform on it. I need $280K base, $470K RSU/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $50K signing bonus. At $280K, I commit to leading this architecture. My floor is $258K — below that, CrowdStrike's total comp and security market dominance win."
