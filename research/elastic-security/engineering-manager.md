**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at Elastic (Security) lead the teams building the detection, investigation, and response capabilities that make Elastic Security a top-tier SIEM and security analytics platform. This is a dual-expertise EM role: you need deep understanding of both distributed systems engineering (Elasticsearch internals, search performance, data pipelines) and cybersecurity (detection engineering, MITRE ATT&CK, SOC workflows). Elastic's distributed-first, no-HQ culture means EMs manage globally distributed teams across time zones — a leadership challenge that few managers have mastered. Liquid ESTC RSUs at the EM level are substantial, and annual refreshers are aggressive for the security organization given its strategic importance to Elastic's growth.

**Level Mapping:** Elastic EM = Google L6 EM = Meta M1 = CrowdStrike EM = Palo Alto EM = Splunk EM

### 🏗️ Security Organization Scale-Up Lever
Elastic Security is the company's fastest-growing product line, and Engineering Managers are scaling the security engineering organization to match this growth trajectory — hiring globally, building new teams, and establishing the engineering processes that support rapid feature delivery. EMs who can scale security engineering teams while maintaining the technical depth required for SIEM product development are commanding premium compensation in 2026. Use this: "Scaling Elastic Security's engineering organization is the highest-priority leadership challenge at the company. EMs who can build distributed security engineering teams that deliver competitive SIEM features at the velocity the market demands are directly driving the product line that determines ESTC's growth trajectory."

**Global Levers**
1. **Security Engineering Leadership Premium:** "Leading security engineering teams requires dual expertise in distributed systems and cybersecurity — a rare leadership combination. I'd like $260K base to reflect this dual-domain EM role."
2. **Distributed Team Scaling Expertise:** "Building and scaling globally distributed engineering teams is Elastic's core organizational challenge. My experience managing teams across [X] time zones with [Y] direct reports is directly applicable — $390K RSU/4yr."
3. **SIEM Product Velocity Impact:** "My team's feature delivery velocity directly determines whether Elastic Security wins SIEM evaluations against CrowdStrike and Splunk. That competitive impact justifies $390K RSU/4yr with aggressive annual refreshers."
4. **Competing EM Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike EM offer at $248K base / $380K RSU and a Palo Alto EM offer at $245K base / $370K RSU. I need $260K base and $390K RSU/4yr to choose Elastic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to lead Elastic Security's engineering scale-up — building the distributed teams that deliver the detection, investigation, and response features that win enterprise SIEM evaluations. I'm holding EM offers from CrowdStrike at $248K base / $380K RSU/4yr and Palo Alto at $245K base / $370K RSU. Elastic Security's search-native architecture is the superior technical foundation, and I want to lead the teams that build on it. I need $260K base, $390K RSU/4yr, and a $45K signing bonus. At $260K, I commit to scaling Elastic Security engineering. My floor is $238K — below that, CrowdStrike's EM structure and security market position win."
