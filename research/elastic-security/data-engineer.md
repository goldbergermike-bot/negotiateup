**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at Elastic (Security) build the data pipelines that ingest, normalize, and enrich security telemetry from endpoints, networks, clouds, and applications — transforming raw security events into the structured, searchable data that powers Elastic Security's SIEM, detection engine, and investigation workflows. This is a security data engineering role at massive scale: Elastic Security customers generate billions of security events daily, and every event must be ingested, enriched with threat intelligence, normalized to the Elastic Common Schema (ECS), and indexed for real-time search. Data Engineers who understand both modern data engineering practices and cybersecurity data models are commanding premium compensation.

### 🏗️ Security Data Pipeline & ECS Lever
In 2026, Elastic is investing heavily in its security data ingestion and normalization pipeline — expanding ECS coverage for cloud security events, improving real-time enrichment with threat intelligence feeds, and building the data infrastructure that supports AI-powered security analytics. Data Engineers building these pipelines are enabling every detection, investigation, and response capability in Elastic Security. Use this: "The security data pipeline is the foundation of every SIEM capability — every detection rule, every investigation workflow, every AI-powered analysis depends on reliable, enriched, normalized security data. Data Engineers building this pipeline are enabling Elastic Security's entire product strategy."

**Global Levers**
1. **Security Data Specialization:** "Building security data pipelines at SIEM scale — billions of events/day, real-time enrichment, ECS normalization, threat intelligence integration — requires specialized expertise. I'd like $195K base for this niche skill set."
2. **Elastic Common Schema Expertise:** "ECS is the data foundation of Elastic Security. My expertise in [security data normalization / event taxonomy / threat intelligence data models] accelerates ECS development — $185K RSU/4yr."
3. **Liquid RSU Revenue Alignment:** "My data pipeline work directly enables the SIEM features that win enterprise deals and drive ESTC stock. I'd like $185K RSU/4yr to align my equity with this revenue impact — and a $20K signing bonus."
4. **Competing Data Engineering Offers:** "I'm holding a Splunk offer at $188K base / $195K RSU and a CrowdStrike offer at $182K base / $180K RSU. I need $195K base and $185K RSU/4yr to choose Elastic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the security data foundation that powers Elastic SIEM — the ingestion pipelines, ECS normalization, and threat intelligence enrichment that enable every detection and investigation capability. I'm holding a Splunk offer at $188K base / $195K RSU/4yr. Elastic's search-native data architecture is technically superior, and I want to build on it. I need $195K base, $185K RSU/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $195K, I'm in. My floor is $178K — below that, Splunk's liquid equity and security data scope win."
