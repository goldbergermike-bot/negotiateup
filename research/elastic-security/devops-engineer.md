**Negotiation DNA**
DevOps Engineers at Elastic (Security) build and operate the infrastructure that runs Elastic Cloud — the managed Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Elastic Security platform that enterprise customers trust with their most sensitive security data. This role carries significant responsibility: Elastic Cloud's security customers demand 99.99% availability, data sovereignty compliance, and the performance to search billions of security events in real time. DevOps Engineers at Elastic use the company's own observability tools (Elastic Observability) to monitor Elastic Cloud — a dogfooding loop that generates valuable product insights. The distributed-first culture means DevOps engineers manage global infrastructure from anywhere, with liquid ESTC RSUs providing compensation stability.

### 🏗️ Elastic Cloud Security Infrastructure Lever
In 2026, Elastic Cloud is expanding its security-specific infrastructure — dedicated security clusters, compliance-ready deployments (FedRAMP, HIPAA, SOC2), and performance-optimized SIEM environments that handle enterprise security workloads. DevOps Engineers building this security infrastructure are directly enabling the enterprise deals that drive revenue. Use this: "Elastic Cloud's security infrastructure — FedRAMP-ready clusters, SIEM-optimized deployments, and 99.99% availability for security operations — is the foundation of every enterprise security deal. DevOps Engineers building this infrastructure are directly enabling Elastic Security's revenue growth."

**Global Levers**
1. **Security Infrastructure Trust Premium:** "Enterprise security customers trust Elastic Cloud with their most sensitive SIEM data. The reliability and security of the infrastructure I build directly determines whether they renew. I'd like $193K base."
2. **Compliance Infrastructure Expertise:** "Building FedRAMP, HIPAA, and SOC2-compliant infrastructure for security workloads requires specialized DevOps expertise. My experience with [compliance automation / security infrastructure / regulated environments] justifies $175K RSU/4yr."
3. **Dogfooding Dual Value:** "Using Elastic Observability to monitor Elastic Cloud generates operational insights that feed directly into product improvements. That dual operations + product value justifies $193K base and a $20K signing bonus."
4. **Competing DevOps Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike SRE offer at $182K base / $175K RSU and a Datadog offer at $185K base / $180K RSU. I need $193K base and $175K RSU/4yr to choose Elastic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to build the security infrastructure backbone of Elastic Cloud — the FedRAMP-ready clusters, SIEM-optimized environments, and 99.99% reliability that enterprise security customers demand. I'm holding a Datadog offer at $185K base / $180K RSU/4yr. Elastic's security infrastructure challenges are uniquely impactful, and I want to build on them. I need $193K base, $175K RSU/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $193K, I'm in. My floor is $175K — below that, Datadog's observability infrastructure and equity win."
