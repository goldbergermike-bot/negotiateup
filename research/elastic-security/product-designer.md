**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Elastic (Security) design the interfaces that security analysts use to detect, investigate, and respond to cyber threats — alert triage dashboards, investigation timelines, threat hunting queries, and incident response workflows. This is one of the most consequential design domains in technology: your UX decisions directly impact how fast security teams can identify and stop attacks. Bad design in a security tool isn't just a friction issue — it's a breach risk. Designers who understand SOC analyst workflows, cybersecurity investigation patterns, and the unique demands of high-stress security operations are rare and valuable. Elastic's distributed-first culture means design collaboration happens async, and the Elastic Design System (EUI) provides a robust foundation.

### 🏗️ Security Analyst Experience & SOC Efficiency Lever
In 2026, Elastic Security is redesigning the analyst experience — creating unified investigation workflows, AI-assisted alert triage interfaces, and threat hunting UX that reduces mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR). Product Designers who can create security UX that measurably improves SOC efficiency are directly impacting customer retention and competitive win rates. Use this: "The security analyst experience is Elastic Security's product-market differentiator. Designers who can create investigation workflows, alert triage interfaces, and threat hunting UX that measurably reduce MTTD and MTTR are directly driving enterprise renewals and competitive wins."

**Global Levers**
1. **Security UX Specialization:** "Designing for SOC analysts — alert triage under pressure, investigation timeline visualization, threat hunting workflows — is a specialized discipline with life-or-death stakes. I'd like $190K base for this rare expertise."
2. **MTTD/MTTR Impact:** "My design decisions directly impact whether security teams detect threats in minutes or hours. That measurable security outcome justifies $163K RSU/4yr — tied to the metric that matters most to enterprise buyers."
3. **EUI Design System Contribution:** "I'll be contributing to and extending the Elastic UI (EUI) design system for security-specific patterns. That system-level design work benefits the entire product portfolio — $20K signing bonus."
4. **Competing Security Design Offers:** "I'm holding a CrowdStrike design offer at $182K base / $175K RSU and a Palo Alto design offer at $178K base / $165K RSU. I need $190K base and $163K RSU/4yr to choose Elastic."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I want to redesign the security analyst experience at Elastic — creating the investigation workflows, alert triage UX, and threat hunting interfaces that measurably reduce MTTD and MTTR for enterprise security teams. I'm holding a CrowdStrike design offer at $182K base / $175K RSU/4yr. Elastic's Kibana platform and EUI design system are the strongest foundation for security UX innovation. I need $190K base, $163K RSU/4yr, and a $20K signing bonus. At $190K, I commit. My floor is $172K — below that, CrowdStrike's security design investment and equity win."
