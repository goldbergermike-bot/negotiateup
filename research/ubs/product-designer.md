#### Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at UBS are solving one of the most complex design challenges in financial services: unifying the client experience across two of the world's largest wealth management platforms. The Credit Suisse integration demands designers who can rationalize decades of divergent design language, interaction patterns, and information architecture into a single, coherent UBS experience — all while millions of clients continue transacting on both platforms simultaneously.

This is not incremental design work. UBS is rebuilding the client-facing layer of its wealth management, investment banking, and digital banking products to accommodate the merged client base. Designers must navigate the tension between maintaining continuity for existing UBS clients and creating a welcoming transition experience for Credit Suisse clients who are being migrated. Every design decision carries operational implications: a well-designed migration flow reduces support call volume, accelerates client adoption, and directly contributes to the decommissioning of legacy Credit Suisse interfaces.

Your negotiation leverage stems from the strategic importance of design in the integration. Poor migration UX leads to client attrition — and each wealth management client who leaves UBS during the transition represents millions in lost assets under management. Designers who can demonstrate experience in platform migration UX, financial services design, or large-scale design system unification hold significant negotiating power. UBS understands that the difference between a smooth client migration and a chaotic one often comes down to design quality.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

Product Designers contribute to UBS's $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings target in ways that are less obvious but profoundly impactful. Every Credit Suisse client-facing application that is decommissioned requires a migration experience that moves clients to the UBS platform seamlessly. Designers who create migration flows that minimize client friction directly accelerate the decommissioning timeline — enabling engineering to shut down legacy systems faster. Poorly designed migration experiences, by contrast, delay decommissioning by months as support teams handle confused clients and remediate failed transitions.

The scale is enormous. Millions of Credit Suisse clients across dozens of countries must be transitioned to UBS platforms. Each client segment — ultra-high-net-worth, institutional, retail — requires a tailored migration experience that respects their unique workflows and expectations. The design system itself must be unified: Credit Suisse's and UBS's component libraries, design tokens, and interaction patterns must be consolidated into a single system that supports both the migration period and the steady-state future.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** Product Designers can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $15K-$35K annually, tied to the client migration velocity and legacy interface decommissioning their designs enable. Designers who own the migration UX for high-value client segments (UHNW, institutional) receive bonuses at the upper end of this range due to the revenue sensitivity of those transitions.

- **Design System Consolidation Premium:** Designers who lead the unification of UBS and Credit Suisse design systems receive a consolidation premium of $10K-$20K annually. A unified design system accelerates all downstream migration work by enabling engineering to build migration interfaces faster. This premium reflects the multiplicative impact of design system work on the overall savings timeline.

- **Client Attrition Prevention Attribution:** UBS tracks client attrition during migration by platform and segment. Designers whose migration flows achieve below-threshold attrition rates — keeping more clients on-platform during the transition — receive attribution bonuses of $8K-$18K. This directly ties design quality to business outcomes and savings realization.

- **Migration UX Research Impact:** Designers who conduct and apply migration-specific UX research — testing transition flows with actual Credit Suisse clients, identifying friction points, and iterating — receive a research impact bonus of $5K-$15K. This reflects the risk-mitigation value of research-informed design during a high-stakes client transition.

#### Global Levers

**1. Big Tech Design Parity (Value: $15K-$30K)**
UBS design compensation historically trails Big Tech. Use competing offers to close the gap. Script: *"I have a Product Design offer from [Google/Apple/Figma] at $[X] total comp. I'm drawn to UBS's integration design challenge — it's a once-in-a-career opportunity. But the compensation gap is $25K. Can we close this with a base increase and a guaranteed Efficiency-Impact bonus?"*

**2. Migration UX Expertise Premium (Value: $12K-$25K)**
Platform migration UX is a rare specialization. Price your expertise accordingly. Script: *"My experience designing migration flows for [specific platform migration] at [previous company] resulted in [X% client retention / X% reduction in support tickets]. This expertise directly applies to the CS client migration. A $20K premium on the offer reflects the risk reduction I bring to the client transition."*

**3. Design System Leadership Signing Bonus (Value: $18K-$30K)**
If you'll be leading design system unification, negotiate a signing bonus that reflects the scope. Script: *"Unifying the UBS and Credit Suisse design systems is a foundational project that impacts every migration workstream downstream. A $25K signing bonus reflects the immediate impact of establishing design system governance and accelerating migration interface development."*

**4. RSU Uplift for Integration Tenure (Value: $10K-$20K/year)**
Commit to the integration timeline for enhanced equity. Script: *"I'm committed to seeing the client migration through. An additional $15K/year in RSUs tied to a 2-year integration commitment gives both of us certainty during the transition period and rewards me for the continuity I provide to the design organization."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $215K TC for New York — the 75th percentile of the range. Lead with your migration UX or design system experience and quantify client impact metrics from previous work. Counter any initial offer below $190K by citing the strategic importance of design in the client migration — client attrition during the transition directly impacts UBS's revenue from $5.7T in invested assets. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 189K / $215K. For London, anchor at £172K / $215K. Your walk-away floor should be $180K TC (New York), CHF 158K / $180K (Zurich), or £144K / $180K (London). If the base is capped, push for a $25K signing bonus and a guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus of $18K. Request that your design system ownership role is documented in the offer letter.
