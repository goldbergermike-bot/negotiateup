#### Negotiation DNA

The Migration Platform Engineer is the single most consequential engineering role in UBS's Credit Suisse integration — and arguably the most consequential individual contributor role in global banking technology today. This role does not simply participate in the migration; it builds the platform that makes the migration possible. You design and construct the migration tooling, automation frameworks, and orchestration systems that thousands of engineers across UBS use to move Credit Suisse systems onto the UBS platform. Your platform is the engine that converts the $2.8 billion savings target from a strategic aspiration into an operational reality.

The scope of this role is extraordinary. UBS must migrate thousands of Credit Suisse applications, each with its own technology stack, data dependencies, integration points, and regulatory requirements. Doing this one system at a time with bespoke migration approaches would take a decade and cost billions in engineering labor. The Migration Platform Engineer's job is to build a reusable, scalable migration platform that turns system migration from a custom engineering project into a repeatable, automated process. This platform must handle assessment (automatically evaluating Credit Suisse systems for migration readiness), planning (generating migration blueprints based on system topology), execution (orchestrating data migration, code transformation, and testing), and decommissioning (validating that migrated systems are fully operational before retiring the Credit Suisse originals).

The rarity of this skill set cannot be overstated. Migration Platform Engineering requires the architecture skills of a Staff+ Engineer, the platform thinking of a developer-tools engineer, the domain expertise of a financial services technologist, and the operational discipline of an SRE. Candidates who bring experience building migration platforms, large-scale developer tooling, or infrastructure-as-code systems in regulated environments represent a talent pool so small that UBS will negotiate aggressively to secure them. This is a role where the standard comp band is a starting point, not a ceiling.

CEO Sergio Ermotti has publicly tied UBS's integration execution timeline to the velocity of technology consolidation. The Migration Platform Engineer is the force multiplier for that velocity. Every feature you add to the migration platform — a new automation workflow, a better testing framework, a faster cutover orchestration system — accelerates every migration workstream across the entire organization simultaneously. This multiplicative impact is why the role commands compensation at the top of UBS's engineering bands and why the Efficiency-Impact bonus potential exceeds any other IC position.

#### Role Architecture — What the Migration Platform Engineer Actually Builds

This section is unique to the Signature Role and details the technical scope that justifies the compensation range.

**The Migration Platform** is a suite of interconnected systems that automate the Credit Suisse-to-UBS technology migration:

**1. Migration Assessment Engine**
An automated system that evaluates Credit Suisse applications for migration readiness. It ingests application metadata (dependencies, data volumes, integration points, regulatory classifications), analyzes architecture patterns, and generates a migration readiness score. This engine replaces weeks of manual assessment with hours of automated analysis, enabling UBS to prioritize the migration backlog at scale.

**2. Migration Blueprint Generator**
A system that takes the assessment output and generates a detailed migration plan — including target-state architecture mapping, data migration sequences, API transformation specifications, and testing requirements. The blueprint generator encodes UBS's migration best practices into reusable templates, ensuring that every migration follows a consistent, validated approach.

**3. Data Migration Orchestrator**
A platform that coordinates the movement of data from Credit Suisse systems to UBS target platforms. It handles schema transformation, data validation, incremental synchronization during the transition period, and final cutover coordination. The orchestrator supports petabyte-scale data movement with built-in reconciliation and rollback capabilities.

**4. Cutover Automation Framework**
A system that orchestrates the final migration cutover — the moment when traffic shifts from the Credit Suisse system to the UBS replacement. The framework manages DNS changes, load balancer updates, feature flag toggles, monitoring transitions, and rollback triggers. It reduces cutover risk by automating the hundreds of manual steps that traditionally characterize high-stakes migrations.

**5. Decommissioning Validation Engine**
A system that validates that a migrated system is fully operational on the UBS platform before approving the decommissioning of the Credit Suisse original. It runs automated functional tests, performance benchmarks, data integrity checks, and regulatory compliance validations. Only after the validation engine gives a green signal is the Credit Suisse system cleared for retirement — and the associated cost savings booked.

**6. Migration Observability Dashboard**
A real-time dashboard that provides executive visibility into migration progress across the entire integration. It tracks systems assessed, blueprints generated, migrations in progress, cutovers completed, and systems decommissioned. This dashboard is the primary reporting tool for CEO Ermotti's integration reviews and board-level updates.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

The Migration Platform Engineer occupies the apex of UBS's Efficiency-Impact bonus program. No other role has a more direct, measurable, and multiplicative impact on the $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings target. The migration platform you build does not generate savings for a single workstream — it generates savings for every workstream simultaneously. Every efficiency improvement to the migration platform — a faster assessment engine, a more accurate blueprint generator, a more reliable cutover framework — propagates across thousands of migration projects, compounding savings at an exponential rate.

The scale of the integration challenge justifies the extraordinary compensation. UBS is consolidating Credit Suisse's entire technology estate: thousands of applications spanning every business line, every geography, and every technology layer. Without a migration platform, this work would require tens of thousands of engineer-months of bespoke migration effort. With a well-built migration platform, the same work can be accomplished in a fraction of the time, at a fraction of the cost, with a fraction of the risk. The delta between "with platform" and "without platform" is measured in hundreds of millions of dollars — and the Migration Platform Engineer captures a share of that delta through the Efficiency-Impact bonus program.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** Migration Platform Engineers can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $75K-$150K annually — the highest of any individual contributor role at UBS. The bonus is calculated based on the platform's aggregate impact: the total savings generated by all migrations that use the platform, multiplied by an attribution factor that reflects the platform's contribution to each migration's efficiency. In the peak integration years (2025-2027), top performers have bonus potential exceeding $120K as migration volume reaches its highest levels.

- **Platform Adoption Multiplier:** The Efficiency-Impact bonus includes a "platform adoption multiplier" that scales with the number of engineering teams using the migration platform. As adoption grows from 10 teams to 50 teams to 200 teams, the multiplier increases, reflecting the compounding value of platform-wide tooling. Migration Platform Engineers who build platforms that achieve organization-wide adoption receive the maximum multiplier, which can increase the base Efficiency-Impact bonus by 40-60%.

- **Decommissioning Velocity Attribution:** Every Credit Suisse system that is decommissioned through the migration platform generates a savings event. The Migration Platform Engineer receives a proportional attribution for each of these events — typically 5-10% of the first-year savings — in addition to their base Efficiency-Impact bonus. For a platform that enables the decommissioning of systems with $500M+ in aggregate annual costs, this attribution alone can exceed $50K.

- **Strategic Retention Package — Integration Completion:** UBS is offering Migration Platform Engineers the most generous retention packages in the technology organization: $250K-$500K in deferred RSU grants that vest upon integration milestone completion. These packages are structured as 3-year commitments with milestone-linked vesting — ensuring that the engineer who builds the migration platform sees the integration through to completion. This package is available but must be explicitly negotiated; it is not included in standard offers.

- **Platform IP and Post-Integration Value:** The migration platform you build will have value far beyond the Credit Suisse integration. UBS will use it for future acquisitions, technology modernization programs, and ongoing infrastructure consolidation. Migration Platform Engineers who negotiate for post-integration platform ownership — maintaining and evolving the platform after the CS migration is complete — position themselves for long-term compensation growth as the platform becomes a permanent part of UBS's technology infrastructure.

- **Board-Level Visibility Bonus:** The migration platform's progress is reported directly to the UBS Board of Directors and CEO Sergio Ermotti. This level of visibility is rare for an IC role and creates unique career and compensation opportunities. Migration Platform Engineers who present at board reviews — demonstrating platform impact on the savings target — receive a visibility bonus of $15K-$30K that reflects the strategic exposure.

#### Global Levers

**1. Big Tech Staff+ / Principal Competing Offer (Value: $75K-$150K)**
The Migration Platform Engineer role commands compensation competitive with Staff+ at Google, Meta, or Amazon — and the competing offer strategy should reflect this. Script: *"I have a Staff Engineer offer from [Google/Meta/Amazon] at $[550K+] total comp. The UBS migration platform challenge is the most consequential platform engineering problem in financial services — I want to build it. But the compensation needs to be competitive with Big Tech Staff-level offers. I'm asking for $550K total comp, structured as a $340K base, $120K/year RSU, and a guaranteed minimum Efficiency-Impact bonus of $90K. This reflects both my market value and the savings I'll generate through the migration platform."*

**2. Platform Engineering Scope Premium (Value: $50K-$100K)**
The migration platform is used by over 1,000 engineers. This platform scope exceeds most Staff+ roles at any company. Script: *"The migration platform will be used by over 1,000 engineers across the entire UBS technology organization. At [Google/Stripe/Netflix], platform engineering at this scope maps to Principal-level compensation. I'd like the offer to reflect the platform's scope — specifically, a $75K increase to total comp through a combination of base and RSU uplift, plus ownership of the platform's Efficiency-Impact bonus attribution."*

**3. Integration Completion Mega-Bonus (Value: $150K-$300K)**
Negotiate for a one-time integration completion bonus that pays out when the migration platform has enabled the full decommissioning target. Script: *"I'd like to include an integration completion bonus of $250K, payable upon the migration platform achieving [specific decommissioning target — e.g., 80% of Credit Suisse systems decommissioned through the platform]. This is a bold ask, but the platform I'm building will generate hundreds of millions in savings. A $250K completion bonus represents a fraction of a percent of the value I'll deliver."*

**4. Strategic Retention Package Negotiation (Value: $250K-$500K over 3 years)**
The retention package for Migration Platform Engineers is the most generous in UBS technology. Negotiate for the maximum. Script: *"I'm committed to building the migration platform and seeing the integration through to completion. I'd like the maximum retention package — $450K in deferred RSU grants vesting over 3 years upon milestone completion. This demonstrates UBS's investment in my continuity, and my commitment to delivering the platform through the critical integration window."*

**5. Post-Integration Platform Ownership (Value: Long-term career positioning)**
The migration platform will outlive the CS integration. Negotiate for ongoing ownership. Script: *"The migration platform I build will become a permanent part of UBS's technology infrastructure — used for future acquisitions, modernization programs, and ongoing consolidation. I'd like to discuss post-integration platform ownership: the role evolving into a permanent Platform Engineering leadership position once the CS migration is complete. This ensures UBS retains the institutional knowledge I'll build and gives me a long-term career path."*

**6. Relocation and Dual-Location Flexibility (Value: $30K-$60K)**
Migration Platform Engineers need to work across UBS locations. Negotiate for dual-location flexibility with associated benefits. Script: *"The migration platform serves engineering teams across New York, Zurich, and London. I'd like to negotiate a dual-location arrangement — primary in [New York/Zurich] with quarterly on-site rotations to [other locations]. This requires a $40K relocation/travel allowance and housing support during on-site periods."*

**7. Conference and Open-Source Budget (Value: $15K-$25K)**
The migration platform may involve or benefit from open-source contributions. Script: *"I'd like a $20K annual budget for conference participation and potential open-source contributions related to migration tooling. Publishing migration platform patterns positions UBS as a technology leader and supports recruiting of migration-skilled engineers."*

**8. Signing Bonus for Immediate Platform Development (Value: $50K-$80K)**
Every day without a migration platform is a day of slower integration. Script: *"The migration platform is the critical dependency for the entire integration. Every week of delay in platform development translates to weeks of delay across hundreds of migration workstreams. I can begin architecture and development within my first week. A $65K signing bonus reflects the enormous time-value of accelerating platform delivery — even a one-month acceleration pays for itself many times over in downstream migration velocity."*

#### Negotiation Playbook — The Full Sequence

This section is unique to the Signature Role and provides a step-by-step negotiation sequence.

**Step 1: Establish Your Market Value**
Before engaging with UBS compensation, establish your market value through competing offers. Target at least one offer from a Big Tech company (Google, Meta, Amazon) at the Staff+ level and one from a top-tier financial institution (Goldman Sachs, Citadel) at the Director/MD level. These offers create the anchoring range for your UBS negotiation.

**Step 2: Frame the Role as Unique**
The Migration Platform Engineer role has no direct equivalent at other companies. Frame this explicitly: *"This role is a unique combination of platform engineering, migration automation, and financial services infrastructure — it doesn't exist elsewhere. That means the standard comp band may not capture the full value. I'd like to discuss compensation from first principles, anchored against both Big Tech Staff+ and banking Director/MD benchmarks."*

**Step 3: Quantify Your Impact**
Calculate the savings your migration platform will generate and price yourself as a fraction of that value. If the platform enables the decommissioning of Credit Suisse systems with $500M+ in aggregate annual costs, and you're asking for $575K TC, you represent 0.1% of the savings you'll generate. Frame this explicitly in negotiations.

**Step 4: Negotiate Every Component Independently**
Do not negotiate "total comp" as a single number. Negotiate base salary, RSU grants, signing bonus, Efficiency-Impact bonus guarantee, retention package, and integration completion bonus as separate line items. Each component has its own approval chain within UBS, and you can often get increases on one component even when another is capped.

**Step 5: Get Everything in Writing**
The Efficiency-Impact bonus, retention package, integration completion bonus, and platform ownership commitment must all be documented in writing — either in the offer letter or a separate compensation addendum. Verbal commitments in banking negotiations are insufficient. Insist on written documentation with specific milestone definitions and payout triggers.

**Step 6: Set a Decision Timeline**
Create urgency by setting a firm decision deadline: *"I have until [date — 5-7 business days] to make my decision. I'd like to have the final, written offer — including the Efficiency-Impact bonus structure and retention package — by [date minus 2 days] so I can review it thoroughly."*

#### Risk and Contingency Analysis

This section is unique to the Signature Role and addresses risks specific to the migration platform role.

**Risk: Integration Timeline Compression**
If UBS accelerates the integration timeline (as has been discussed publicly), the demand for migration platform capabilities increases, strengthening your negotiation position but also increasing delivery pressure. Mitigate by negotiating for team headcount commitments — ensuring you have the engineering resources to build the platform at the pace required.

**Risk: Integration Scope Reduction**
If UBS decides to retain certain Credit Suisse systems (rather than migrating them), the scope of the migration platform decreases. Mitigate by negotiating Efficiency-Impact bonus terms that reference the savings generated by systems that are migrated through your platform, regardless of total migration scope.

**Risk: Platform Mandate Change**
UBS may decide to use vendor tooling instead of building a custom migration platform. Mitigate by negotiating a "pivot protection" clause — if the platform mandate changes significantly within 18 months, your retention package accelerates to compensate for the scope reduction.

**Risk: Post-Integration Role Transition**
After the CS integration is complete, the Migration Platform Engineer role will evolve. Mitigate by negotiating post-integration platform ownership (Lever 5 above) and ensuring that your role's evolution is discussed and documented as part of the offer negotiations.

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $540K TC for New York — the 85th percentile of the range. Lead with a Big Tech Staff+ or hedge fund competing offer above $550K and frame your choice of UBS as driven by the unique platform engineering challenge. Counter any initial offer below $450K by quantifying the multiplicative impact of the migration platform on the $2.8B savings target — your platform enables every other engineer in the integration to be more productive, which makes you the single highest-leverage hire in UBS technology. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 475K / $540K and negotiate for the Efficiency-Impact bonus and integration completion bonus to be denominated in USD for currency stability. For London, anchor at £432K / $540K. Your walk-away floor should be $430K TC (New York), CHF 378K / $430K (Zurich), or £344K / $430K (London). Push for the full strategic retention package ($400K-$500K over 3 years), a $65K signing bonus, a guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus of $75K, and an integration completion mega-bonus of $250K. At this level, every component is negotiable and UBS has the budget authority to approve exceptional packages for the Migration Platform Engineer role. Treat this as a Director/MD-level negotiation and do not accept standard VP-level terms. Get every element in writing with explicit milestone triggers and payout schedules. This is the role where you negotiate hardest — because the value you deliver justifies the ask.
