#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at UBS are operating in one of the most demanding leadership environments in financial technology. The Credit Suisse integration requires managers who can simultaneously grow and retain engineering teams, drive migration execution against aggressive timelines, and manage the human complexity of integrating engineers from two distinct corporate cultures. This is not steady-state management — it is high-velocity integration leadership where every sprint directly impacts the $2.8 billion savings target.

The organizational challenge is massive. UBS is absorbing thousands of Credit Suisse technologists while simultaneously building new teams to execute migration workstreams. Engineering Managers must navigate redundancy decisions, cross-team coordination across legacy organizational boundaries, and the retention of key talent who hold institutional knowledge about Credit Suisse systems that cannot be documented. Managers who can hold their teams together, maintain delivery velocity, and make hard organizational calls are extraordinarily valuable to CEO Sergio Ermotti's integration timeline.

Your negotiation leverage as an Engineering Manager stems from the scarcity of leaders who combine technical depth with organizational savvy in high-stakes integration environments. UBS needs managers who understand the engineering well enough to make sound migration prioritization decisions, while also possessing the leadership skills to motivate teams through a multi-year integration marathon. Candidates with experience managing teams through M&A integrations, large-scale platform migrations, or rapid organizational scaling hold the strongest negotiation position.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

Engineering Managers are the force multipliers of UBS's $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings program. While individual contributors execute migration tasks, managers orchestrate the team-level delivery that determines whether savings targets are met on schedule. The Efficiency-Impact bonus program for managers is structured around team-level output — the aggregate savings generated by all engineers under your leadership, rather than individual contributions alone.

The scale of the management challenge mirrors the scale of the integration itself. UBS must coordinate the migration of thousands of Credit Suisse applications, manage the integration of engineering teams across New York, Zurich, London, and multiple offshore locations, and maintain operational stability while simultaneously executing the most aggressive technology consolidation in banking history. Engineering Managers who deliver their workstreams on time and under budget are rewarded with the highest bonus payouts in their careers.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** Engineering Managers can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $35K-$80K annually, calculated as a function of the total savings generated by their teams. Managers overseeing high-value migration workstreams — such as trading platform consolidation or risk system decommissioning — consistently receive payouts at the upper end. The bonus is additive to the standard management bonus, which is itself typically 20-30% of base salary.

- **Team Delivery Multiplier:** Unlike IC bonuses, the Engineering Manager's Efficiency-Impact bonus includes a "team delivery multiplier" that scales with the number of systems successfully migrated or decommissioned by the manager's team. A team that decommissions 10 Credit Suisse systems in a quarter generates a higher multiplier than a team that decommissions 3. Negotiate for clarity on how this multiplier is calculated at the offer stage.

- **Organizational Scaling Bonus:** Managers who successfully scale their teams during the integration — hiring, onboarding, and ramping new engineers to productive migration work within 90 days — receive an additional organizational scaling bonus of $15K-$30K. This reflects the reality that team growth directly accelerates the savings timeline. Negotiate for this bonus to be guaranteed in Year 1 when you're building a new team.

- **Retention Authority Budget:** Engineering Managers receive a discretionary retention budget of $50K-$150K per year to retain key engineers on their teams during the integration window. While this is not direct compensation, it is a negotiable perk that signals your seniority and authority. Managers with larger retention budgets have more organizational power and are typically compensated at the higher end of the band.

#### Global Levers

**1. Management Span Premium (Value: $25K-$50K)**
If your team size exceeds the standard band, negotiate for compensation that reflects your actual span of control. Script: *"The role involves managing 18 engineers across 4 migration workstreams, which is significantly above the typical 8-12 person team at this level. At Goldman Sachs, this span would map to Executive Director with a comp floor of $[X]. I'd like the offer to reflect the actual scope of the role."*

**2. Integration Leadership Signing Bonus (Value: $30K-$55K)**
Your ability to lead teams through integration complexity commands a signing premium. Script: *"My experience managing teams through the [specific M&A/migration] at [previous company] is directly applicable to the CS integration. A $45K signing bonus reflects the accelerated value I'll deliver — my teams won't need a 6-month learning curve on integration best practices."*

**3. Director-Level Placement (Value: $40K-$70K)**
Push for Director-level placement if the scope warrants it. The VP-to-Director jump at UBS carries significant compensation implications. Script: *"Given the scope — managing 15+ engineers, owning 4 critical migration workstreams, and reporting directly to [senior leader] — this role maps to Director level. I'd like to discuss Director-level placement and the associated compensation adjustment."*

**4. Efficiency-Impact Bonus Guarantee with Team Ramp Protection (Value: $35K-$60K)**
Negotiate for a guaranteed minimum Efficiency-Impact bonus in Year 1 that accounts for team ramp time. Script: *"In Year 1, I'll be building and ramping the team while simultaneously delivering on migration milestones. I'd like a guaranteed minimum Efficiency-Impact bonus of $50K that recognizes the leadership investment required to build a high-performing migration team from scratch."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $365K TC for New York — the 75th percentile of the range. Lead with your team leadership experience in migration or M&A contexts and quantify the delivery outcomes your teams have achieved. Counter any initial offer below $320K by citing the management span, the number of migration workstreams you'll own, and the direct relationship between your team's output and the $2.8B savings target. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 321K / $365K and push for the bonus to be denominated in USD. For London, anchor at £292K / $365K. Your walk-away floor should be $300K TC (New York), CHF 264K / $300K (Zurich), or £240K / $300K (London). Push for Director-level placement if the scope exceeds 15 reports, a $45K signing bonus, and a guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus of $50K. Ensure the retention authority budget is documented in your offer.
