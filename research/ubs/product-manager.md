#### Negotiation DNA

Product Managers at UBS during the Credit Suisse integration occupy one of the most strategically consequential PM roles in global finance. You are not building features for growth — you are defining the product roadmap for the largest banking technology merger in history. Every prioritization decision you make — which Credit Suisse product to sunset, which UBS platform to enhance, which client migration sequence to execute — directly determines whether the $2.8 billion savings target is achieved on schedule.

The integration demands PMs who can navigate extraordinary complexity: balancing engineering velocity against regulatory constraints, managing stakeholder expectations across two legacy organizations, and ensuring that client experience remains seamless during massive underlying platform changes. Millions of wealth management clients, institutional banking relationships, and trading counterparties depend on product decisions being made correctly. CEO Sergio Ermotti's integration execution mandate flows directly through Product Management.

Your negotiation position is strengthened by the unique nature of this PM role. Integration PMs require a combination of financial services domain expertise, technical fluency (you must understand system architecture deeply enough to make migration prioritization decisions), and organizational leadership skills that are rarely found in a single candidate. PMs with M&A integration experience, platform consolidation product management, or financial services product leadership represent a talent pool that UBS must pay premium rates to access.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

Product Managers are the strategic decision-makers in UBS's $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings initiative. While engineers execute migrations, PMs decide what gets migrated, when, and in what order. These prioritization decisions directly determine the pace and magnitude of savings realization. A PM who sequences migrations optimally — prioritizing high-cost Credit Suisse systems for early decommissioning — can accelerate billions in savings by quarters.

The integration involves thousands of Credit Suisse products and platforms that must be rationalized against UBS's existing portfolio. Each product decision carries financial weight: maintaining a redundant Credit Suisse product for an extra quarter costs millions in licensing, infrastructure, and operational overhead. PMs who can make fast, defensible sunset decisions — while managing the client impact — are directly driving the savings engine.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** Product Managers can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $25K-$55K annually, tied to the savings generated by the product areas they manage. PMs who own high-value product rationalization decisions — such as sunsetting redundant wealth management platforms or consolidating client reporting systems — receive bonuses at the upper end of this range. The bonus is additive to the standard PM bonus.

- **Product Rationalization Authority:** PMs who hold "sunset authority" for Credit Suisse products receive a premium within the Efficiency-Impact program. Each product sunset decision that eliminates $X in annual operating costs generates a direct attribution to the PM's bonus calculation. Negotiate for ownership of high-cost product areas at the offer stage to maximize your savings attribution.

- **Client Migration Velocity Bonus:** PMs who accelerate client migration timelines — moving wealth management clients from Credit Suisse platforms to UBS platforms ahead of schedule — receive a velocity bonus of $10K-$25K per quarter of acceleration. This reflects the compounding savings effect of early migration: every client moved early reduces operational costs on the legacy platform.

- **Integration Roadmap Ownership Premium:** PMs who own the master integration roadmap for their product domain receive a planning premium of $15K-$30K annually. This reflects the strategic nature of roadmap ownership — the PM who sets the integration sequence determines the savings trajectory. Negotiate for roadmap-level ownership to access this premium tier.

#### Global Levers

**1. Strategy Role Parity (Value: $20K-$40K)**
UBS Product Management during the integration is functionally a strategy role. Price it accordingly. Script: *"This PM role involves making $100M+ product rationalization decisions that directly impact UBS's savings target. At McKinsey or BCG, an engagement manager leading a similar integration workstream would earn $[X]. I'd like the offer to reflect the strategic nature of this position — specifically, a $30K increase to base salary."*

**2. Integration PM Signing Bonus (Value: $25K-$45K)**
Your integration-specific PM expertise accelerates time-to-impact. Script: *"My experience leading product rationalization during the [specific M&A/integration] at [previous company] means I can begin making migration prioritization decisions within weeks. A $35K signing bonus reflects the value of immediate strategic contribution versus a 3-month ramp."*

**3. Product Domain Ownership Expansion (Value: $15K-$35K)**
Negotiate for ownership of additional product domains to increase your Efficiency-Impact bonus exposure. Script: *"I'd like to discuss expanding my product domain ownership to include [additional Credit Suisse product area]. The broader scope increases my ability to drive savings and justifies a corresponding increase in both base compensation and Efficiency-Impact bonus ceiling."*

**4. RSU Uplift for Integration Commitment (Value: $15K-$30K/year)**
Commit to the integration timeline in exchange for enhanced equity compensation. Script: *"I'm prepared to commit to a 2.5-year tenure through the critical integration period. In return, I'd like an additional $25K/year in RSU grants that vest upon integration milestone completion. This aligns our incentives perfectly."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $275K TC for New York — the 75th percentile of the range. Lead with your product rationalization and integration experience, quantifying the financial impact of your past product decisions. Counter any initial offer below $245K by citing the strategic nature of the PM role in the CS migration — you are making decisions that directly determine the pace of $2.8B in savings. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 242K / $275K and negotiate for dual-currency flexibility. For London, anchor at £220K / $275K. Your walk-away floor should be $230K TC (New York), CHF 202K / $230K (Zurich), or £184K / $230K (London).
