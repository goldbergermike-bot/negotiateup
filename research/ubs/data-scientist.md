#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at UBS are at the center of the most data-intensive banking integration ever attempted. The Credit Suisse acquisition merged two of the world's largest financial data estates — spanning decades of client transaction history, risk models, market data feeds, and regulatory reporting datasets. Reconciling, consolidating, and extracting value from this combined dataset is a data science challenge of extraordinary scale, and the candidates who can execute it are in fierce demand.

UBS's $5.7 trillion in invested assets generates a data footprint that rivals the largest technology companies. With the Credit Suisse integration, this data estate has roughly doubled in complexity. Data Scientists are needed to build models that optimize migration sequencing, predict client attrition risk during transitions, identify data quality issues before they cascade into regulatory violations, and quantify the cost savings generated by system decommissioning. Every insight that accelerates the migration or reduces its risk contributes directly to the $2.8 billion savings target.

Your negotiation leverage is amplified by the competitive market for Data Scientists with financial services expertise. UBS competes for this talent against not only Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan but also against quantitative hedge funds (Citadel, Two Sigma, DE Shaw) that offer significantly higher base compensation. Candidates who combine statistical rigor with domain knowledge of financial data, regulatory constraints, and the specific challenges of data migration in banking hold the strongest position.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

Data Scientists play a critical role in optimizing UBS's $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings through analytics-driven migration decisions. The integration involves reconciling millions of client records, thousands of data pipelines, and decades of historical data across two massive banking platforms. Data Scientists who build models that improve migration accuracy, reduce data reconciliation errors, and predict the optimal sequencing of system decommissioning directly accelerate the savings timeline.

The complexity of the data challenge cannot be overstated. Credit Suisse and UBS maintained separate client data models, risk frameworks, and reporting taxonomies. Merging these into a unified data estate requires sophisticated entity resolution, data quality modeling, and lineage tracking. Data Scientists who can navigate this complexity — and build scalable solutions rather than manual workarounds — are among the most valuable contributors to the integration.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** Data Scientists can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $22K-$50K annually, tied to the quantifiable impact of their analytics work on migration outcomes. Scientists who build models that optimize migration sequencing — reducing the time-to-decommission for high-cost systems — receive bonuses at the upper end of this range. The bonus is additive to standard variable compensation.

- **Data Reconciliation Accuracy Premium:** Data Scientists who achieve above-threshold accuracy rates in client data reconciliation during migration receive a quality premium of $10K-$22K. Inaccurate data reconciliation delays decommissioning and creates regulatory risk — scientists who deliver clean, validated data migrations directly accelerate savings. Negotiate for reconciliation accuracy targets and their associated bonus tiers at the offer stage.

- **Predictive Migration Modeling Bonus:** Scientists who build predictive models for client attrition risk during migration — enabling UBS to proactively retain high-value clients — receive a modeling bonus of $12K-$25K. Each client retained represents millions in assets under management, making attrition prediction one of the highest-ROI data science applications in the integration.

- **Regulatory Data Compliance Attribution:** The integration must satisfy regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions. Data Scientists who build compliance-ready data pipelines — ensuring that migrated data meets FINMA, FCA, SEC, and other regulatory standards — receive a compliance attribution bonus of $8K-$18K. This reflects the risk mitigation value of analytics-driven regulatory compliance.

#### Global Levers

**1. Quant Fund Competing Offer (Value: $30K-$60K)**
Quant funds pay Data Scientists significantly above banking rates. Use this market reality as leverage. Script: *"I have an offer from [Citadel/Two Sigma/DE Shaw] at $[X] total comp. The UBS data integration challenge is more intellectually stimulating than alpha-generation modeling, but the compensation gap is significant. Can we close the delta with a base increase of $25K and a guaranteed minimum Efficiency-Impact bonus of $30K?"*

**2. Data Migration Expertise Signing Bonus (Value: $20K-$40K)**
Your data migration expertise accelerates the integration timeline. Script: *"My experience with large-scale data reconciliation at [previous company] — where I consolidated [X million] records across [Y] systems — maps directly to the CS data integration. A $30K signing bonus reflects the time-to-value of bringing proven data migration methodology from day one."*

**3. Analytics Impact Uplift (Value: $15K-$30K)**
If your models directly optimize migration decisions, negotiate for impact-based compensation. Script: *"The migration optimization models I'll build will directly determine the sequencing of system decommissioning. If my models accelerate the decommissioning of [specific system] by one quarter, that's $[X]M in savings. I'd like the compensation to include a $25K analytics impact uplift tied to model deployment milestones."*

**4. Research Publication and Conference Budget (Value: $8K-$15K)**
UBS benefits from employer branding at data science conferences. Negotiate for a research budget. Script: *"I'd like to include a $12K annual research and conference budget to present migration analytics work at venues like KDD, NeurIPS, or Strata. This positions UBS as a data science leader and supports talent acquisition efforts during the integration."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $268K TC for New York — the 75th percentile of the range. Lead with quantified examples of data migration or reconciliation work and reference quant fund offer rates to establish the competitive market. Counter any initial offer below $240K by citing the scale of the data challenge (millions of records, thousands of data pipelines) and your ability to build models that accelerate the $2.8B savings timeline. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 236K / $268K. For London, anchor at £214K / $268K. Your walk-away floor should be $225K TC (New York), CHF 198K / $225K (Zurich), or £180K / $225K (London). Push for a $30K signing bonus and a guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus of $25K. Ensure analytics impact metrics and associated bonus tiers are documented in writing.
