#### Negotiation DNA

Solutions Architects at UBS during the Credit Suisse integration are the strategic bridge between business requirements and engineering execution. You design the target-state architecture for consolidated systems, define the migration paths that engineering teams follow, and ensure that the merged platform meets the needs of UBS's combined client base across wealth management, investment banking, and asset management. Your architectural blueprints determine whether the $2.8 billion savings target is achievable — and whether it's achievable on schedule.

The Credit Suisse integration presents architectural challenges that have no precedent in banking. You must evaluate thousands of Credit Suisse applications against their UBS equivalents, determine which can be absorbed, which must be rebuilt, and which should be replaced entirely. Every decision must account for regulatory requirements across dozens of jurisdictions, data residency constraints, performance requirements for real-time trading systems, and the need to maintain client service continuity throughout the transition. Solutions Architects who can navigate this multi-dimensional decision space are the intellectual engines of the integration.

Your negotiation position is anchored in the strategic nature of your architectural decisions. A Solutions Architect who designs an efficient migration path for a major Credit Suisse platform saves UBS tens of millions in implementation costs and months of engineering time. Conversely, a poor architectural decision can result in costly rework, delayed decommissioning, and missed savings targets. UBS understands this leverage and is willing to pay premium rates for architects who bring both financial-domain expertise and large-scale integration experience.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

Solutions Architects are the strategic planners of UBS's $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings. While engineers execute migrations, Solutions Architects design the migration blueprints that determine the order, method, and target state for every Credit Suisse system being consolidated. The quality of these blueprints directly impacts the speed and cost of execution — a well-designed migration path can save months of engineering time and millions in implementation costs.

The integration involves rationalizing thousands of Credit Suisse applications against UBS's existing technology landscape. Solutions Architects must conduct deep technical assessments of Credit Suisse systems, map their capabilities to UBS equivalents, identify gaps that require new development, and design integration patterns that minimize risk while maximizing decommissioning velocity. This work spans every technology domain: trading systems, risk engines, client portals, data warehouses, regulatory reporting, and operational infrastructure.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** Solutions Architects can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $28K-$58K annually, tied to the savings generated by the migration blueprints they design. Architects whose designs enable the decommissioning of high-cost Credit Suisse platforms — trading infrastructure, risk systems, data warehouses — receive bonuses at the upper end. The bonus reflects both the direct savings and the engineering efficiency gains from well-designed migration paths.

- **Blueprint Quality Premium:** Solutions Architects whose migration blueprints are executed without significant architectural rework receive a blueprint quality premium of $12K-$25K. This premium incentivizes thorough upfront design work that reduces downstream costs. Negotiate for clarity on how blueprint quality is measured and what rework thresholds trigger the premium.

- **Cross-Domain Integration Authority:** Architects who design integration patterns that span multiple platform domains — connecting wealth management, trading, and risk systems in the target architecture — receive a cross-domain authority bonus of $10K-$22K. This reflects the complexity premium of cross-cutting architectural decisions that impact multiple engineering teams.

- **Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Ownership:** UBS tracks major architectural decisions through a formal ADR process. Solutions Architects who own ADRs with projected savings above $25M receive the highest Efficiency-Impact multiplier. Negotiate for ownership of high-impact ADRs at the offer stage to maximize your bonus ceiling.

#### Global Levers

**1. Consulting Parity Anchoring (Value: $20K-$40K)**
Enterprise architecture work at top consulting firms (McKinsey, Deloitte, Accenture) commands premium rates. Script: *"As a Principal Solutions Architect at [consulting firm], my billing rate was $[X] per hour for integration architecture work. UBS benefits from having this expertise in-house at a fraction of the consulting cost. I'd like the offer to reflect market parity — a $30K base increase brings the compensation in line with in-house architecture rates at peer banks."*

**2. Integration Blueprint IP Premium (Value: $15K-$30K)**
Your architectural blueprints become UBS intellectual property with long-term value. Script: *"The migration blueprints I'll design will serve as architectural templates for future UBS integration work. This IP value extends well beyond the CS integration. A $22K premium reflects the lasting strategic value of this architectural work."*

**3. Director-Level Placement for Cross-Domain Scope (Value: $25K-$50K)**
If your scope spans multiple domains, negotiate for Director-level placement. Script: *"This role requires designing integration architectures across [wealth management, trading, and risk] — three distinct platform domains. At [competitor bank], this cross-domain scope maps to Director-level architecture with a comp floor of $[X]. I'd like to discuss Director-level placement."*

**4. Signing Bonus for Architecture Assessment Acceleration (Value: $22K-$40K)**
Your early architecture assessments set the pace for engineering execution. Script: *"I can begin Credit Suisse system assessments within my first week, accelerating the blueprint delivery timeline by months. A $32K signing bonus reflects the time-value of immediate architectural contribution."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $280K TC for New York — the 75th percentile of the range. Lead with specific examples of integration architecture work and quantify the savings or efficiency gains your designs enabled. Counter any initial offer below $250K by citing the strategic leverage of architectural decisions on the $2.8B savings target — your blueprints determine whether engineering teams spend months or quarters on each migration. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 246K / $280K. For London, anchor at £224K / $280K. Your walk-away floor should be $235K TC (New York), CHF 207K / $235K (Zurich), or £188K / $235K (London). Push for Director-level placement if the scope is cross-domain, a $32K signing bonus, and a guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus of $30K. Ensure blueprint ownership and ADR assignments are documented in the offer.
