#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at UBS are at the intersection of two transformative forces: the Credit Suisse integration and the rapid maturation of AI capabilities in financial services. UBS needs ML/AI Engineers who can apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to accelerate and de-risk the integration — automating migration tasks that would otherwise require thousands of engineering hours, building intelligent systems that identify decommissioning opportunities, and consolidating the ML model estates of two major banks into a unified AI platform.

The AI opportunity within the integration is enormous. UBS and Credit Suisse each built hundreds of ML models for risk management, fraud detection, client analytics, trading signals, and regulatory compliance. These models must be evaluated, consolidated, retrained on merged datasets, and revalidated against regulatory requirements. Simultaneously, new ML capabilities can be deployed to automate migration work itself — using NLP to analyze legacy code documentation, ML to predict migration risk, and AI to optimize decommissioning sequencing. ML/AI Engineers who can deliver on both fronts — model consolidation and migration automation — are among UBS's most strategically valuable hires.

Your negotiation leverage is amplified by the white-hot market for ML/AI talent. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and top-tier hedge funds are all competing for the same talent pool. UBS must offer compensation packages that are competitive with these alternatives while leveraging its unique advantage: the opportunity to apply AI at unprecedented scale in one of the world's most consequential technology integrations. Candidates who combine ML engineering expertise with financial services domain knowledge — or who bring specific experience in AI-driven migration automation — hold extraordinary negotiation power.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

ML/AI Engineers unlock a unique dimension of UBS's $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings: intelligent automation. While traditional engineering approaches to migration are linear — assess, plan, execute, validate — ML/AI Engineers can build systems that accelerate each phase exponentially. Machine learning models that automatically classify Credit Suisse applications for migration readiness, NLP systems that parse legacy documentation to extract migration requirements, and AI-driven testing frameworks that validate data integrity at scale all reduce the engineering hours required for migration by orders of magnitude.

Beyond migration automation, ML/AI Engineers are responsible for consolidating the ML model estates of both banks. Credit Suisse and UBS each operated hundreds of production ML models. Maintaining two parallel model estates is enormously expensive — duplicate model training infrastructure, separate feature stores, redundant model monitoring systems. Consolidating these into a unified ML platform generates substantial savings and positions UBS's AI capabilities for the future.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** ML/AI Engineers can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $35K-$72K annually — among the highest of any individual contributor role. The premium reflects the multiplicative impact of ML/AI work: a single migration automation system can replace hundreds of hours of manual engineering work across dozens of migration workstreams. Engineers who build automation systems with measurable engineering-hour savings receive bonuses at the upper end.

- **Migration Automation Multiplier:** ML/AI Engineers who build automation tools that are adopted across multiple migration workstreams receive a "platform multiplier" on their Efficiency-Impact bonus. If your automation system saves 200 engineering hours per workstream and is adopted by 15 workstreams, the aggregate savings generates a multiplied bonus of $15K-$35K above the base Efficiency-Impact range.

- **Model Consolidation Savings Attribution:** Each Credit Suisse ML model that is successfully consolidated onto the UBS platform generates direct infrastructure savings (reduced training compute, eliminated feature store redundancy, consolidated monitoring). ML/AI Engineers who lead model consolidation receive direct savings attribution of $8K-$20K per high-value model consolidated.

- **AI Innovation Premium:** UBS is investing in next-generation AI capabilities as part of the integration — including GenAI-powered client advisory tools, AI-driven regulatory reporting, and intelligent document processing. ML/AI Engineers who contribute to these strategic AI initiatives receive an innovation premium of $12K-$28K that recognizes the long-term strategic value of their work beyond the immediate integration savings.

#### Global Levers

**1. AI Lab / Big Tech Competing Offer (Value: $40K-$80K)**
AI labs and Big Tech pay ML engineers at the top of the market. Use these offers as anchors. Script: *"I have an offer from [OpenAI/Anthropic/Google DeepMind/Meta AI] at $[X] total comp. UBS's integration AI challenge is uniquely compelling — the opportunity to build ML systems that directly impact billions in savings is unmatched in consumer AI. But the compensation gap is $60K. Can we close this with a base increase, RSU uplift, and a guaranteed Efficiency-Impact bonus floor?"*

**2. Automation ROI Quantification (Value: $25K-$45K)**
Quantify the ROI of your automation work to justify premium compensation. Script: *"The migration automation systems I'll build will save an estimated [X thousand] engineering hours across the integration — equivalent to $[Y]M in avoided labor costs. A $35K increase to total comp represents less than 1% of the savings my automation systems will generate."*

**3. ML Platform Ownership Signing Bonus (Value: $30K-$50K)**
If you'll own the unified ML platform, negotiate a signing bonus for the scope. Script: *"Building the unified ML platform — consolidating Credit Suisse and UBS model infrastructure into a single training, serving, and monitoring stack — is a foundational project with years of strategic value. A $40K signing bonus reflects the platform-level ownership and the immediate reduction in duplicate ML infrastructure costs."*

**4. GPU/Compute Budget Negotiation (Value: $15K-$30K equivalent)**
ML/AI Engineers need compute resources. Negotiate for a dedicated GPU budget. Script: *"I'd like to include a dedicated GPU compute budget of $[X]K per quarter for ML experimentation and model training. Underfunded ML engineers ship slower. This budget directly impacts the velocity of migration automation development and model consolidation."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $360K TC for New York — the 80th percentile of the range. Lead with a competing offer from an AI lab or Big Tech company and frame your choice of UBS as motivated by the integration's unique AI challenges. Counter any initial offer below $310K by quantifying the ROI of migration automation — your ML systems will save UBS orders of magnitude more than the premium they pay you. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 317K / $360K and push for compute budget in addition to compensation. For London, anchor at £288K / $360K. Your walk-away floor should be $295K TC (New York), CHF 260K / $295K (Zurich), or £236K / $295K (London). Push hard for a $40K signing bonus, a guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus of $40K, and a dedicated GPU compute budget. At the ML/AI level, everything is negotiable — especially when you can quantify the savings your work will generate.
