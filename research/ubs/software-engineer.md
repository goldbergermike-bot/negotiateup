#### Negotiation DNA

UBS is in the midst of the largest banking technology integration in history. The Credit Suisse acquisition has created an unprecedented demand for software engineers who can build, migrate, and consolidate systems across two of the world's most complex financial technology stacks. As a Software Engineer at UBS, you are not simply writing code — you are directly contributing to the realization of $2.8 billion in IT decommissioning savings that CEO Sergio Ermotti has committed to investors and the board.

Every line of code that accelerates the migration of Credit Suisse systems onto the UBS platform translates into measurable cost savings. UBS leadership tracks engineering velocity against integration milestones with quarterly precision. Engineers who demonstrate the ability to decompose legacy Credit Suisse services, re-platform them onto UBS's target architecture, and decommission redundant infrastructure are positioned as "savings accelerators" — and their compensation reflects that strategic value.

The integration window is finite. UBS has publicly committed to completing the bulk of technology consolidation by 2027. This creates a time-sensitive premium for engineers who can hit the ground running. Candidates with experience in large-scale system migrations, financial services technology stacks (Java, Python, distributed systems), or legacy system modernization hold exceptional leverage in negotiations. The scarcity of engineers who understand both the technical and regulatory dimensions of banking system consolidation means UBS is willing to pay above-market rates to secure the right talent.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

The Credit Suisse integration represents a $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings opportunity — and UBS is tying engineering performance directly to that target. Software Engineers who contribute to migration milestones are eligible for Efficiency-Impact bonuses that sit on top of standard compensation. These bonuses are structured as performance-based payouts tied to the measurable savings generated by decommissioning redundant Credit Suisse systems, consolidating data centers, and eliminating duplicate technology licenses.

The scale of the challenge is staggering. UBS is integrating thousands of Credit Suisse applications, migrating millions of client accounts, and reconciling decades of legacy infrastructure across multiple continents. Every system that is successfully migrated and decommissioned releases quantifiable savings — from reduced licensing fees and infrastructure costs to eliminated maintenance overhead. Engineers who can demonstrate direct impact on these savings are rewarded accordingly.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** Software Engineers can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $15K-$40K annually, paid in addition to standard bonus and RSU grants. These bonuses scale with the number and complexity of systems successfully migrated or decommissioned. Top performers who lead critical migration workstreams have seen payouts at the upper end of this range.

- **Migration Milestone Acceleration:** UBS tracks integration progress against a detailed milestone roadmap. Engineers who deliver ahead of schedule — completing system cutover, data migration, or platform consolidation before target dates — receive accelerated bonus payouts. Negotiating for milestone-linked bonus triggers at the offer stage is a high-leverage move.

- **Savings Attribution Model:** UBS's finance and technology leadership jointly attribute cost savings to specific engineering initiatives. When you decommission a Credit Suisse application that carried $500K/year in licensing and infrastructure costs, that savings is tracked and attributed. Candidates should ask about "savings attribution" during negotiations to understand how their work maps to bonus eligibility.

- **Integration Window Premium:** The 2025-2027 integration window creates a time-limited premium. UBS is paying above-market rates specifically because the integration timeline is aggressive and the consequences of delay are measured in billions. Candidates should frame their availability and ramp-up speed as direct contributions to the savings timeline — every month of faster delivery compounds the financial impact.

#### Global Levers

**1. Competing Offer Arbitrage (Value: $15K-$30K)**
UBS recruiters are acutely aware that engineers with migration experience are being courted by every major bank. Use competing offers from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, or large tech companies to create upward pressure. Script: *"I have a competing offer from [Bank/Tech Company] at $[X] total comp. I'm genuinely more excited about UBS's integration challenge, but I need the offer to reflect my market value. Can we close the gap on base by $15K and add a signing bonus to make this work?"*

**2. Signing Bonus for Immediate Impact (Value: $20K-$40K)**
The integration timeline makes immediate availability extremely valuable. Frame your start date as a negotiation asset. Script: *"I understand the CS migration timeline is aggressive. I can start within two weeks and begin contributing to [specific system/platform] immediately. Given the time-sensitivity, a $30K signing bonus would reflect the value of accelerated onboarding."*

**3. RSU Uplift via Migration Commitment (Value: $10K-$25K/year)**
Request an RSU grant increase tied to a 2-year commitment through the critical integration phase. Script: *"I'm committed to seeing the integration through. If we can increase the RSU grant by $20K/year to reflect a 2-year retention commitment during the migration, that gives both of us certainty during the most critical period."*

**4. Efficiency-Impact Bonus Guarantee (Value: $15K-$40K)**
Negotiate for a guaranteed minimum Efficiency-Impact bonus in Year 1 while you ramp up. Script: *"I'd like to include a guaranteed minimum Efficiency-Impact bonus of $25K in the first year. As I ramp into the migration workstreams, I'm confident I'll exceed that floor — but the guarantee de-risks my decision to join during a critical integration window."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at the 75th percentile of the range — $220K TC for New York. Lead with your migration-relevant experience and frame yourself as a savings accelerator. Counter any initial offer below $200K by citing the $2.8B savings target and your ability to contribute from day one. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 194K / $220K and emphasize dual-currency flexibility. For London, anchor at £176K / $220K. Your walk-away floor should be $190K TC (New York), CHF 167K / $190K (Zurich), or £152K / $190K (London). If the base is capped, push for a $30K signing bonus and a guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus of $25K. Always request the offer in writing with the Efficiency-Impact bonus structure explicitly documented.
