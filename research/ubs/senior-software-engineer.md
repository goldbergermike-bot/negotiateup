#### Negotiation DNA

The Senior Software Engineer is the linchpin of UBS's Credit Suisse integration execution. While junior engineers execute discrete migration tasks, Senior Engineers own entire system domains — making architectural decisions about which Credit Suisse systems to re-platform, which to rebuild, and which to decommission outright. This level of ownership means your decisions directly impact the trajectory of the $2.8 billion savings target. UBS's leadership recognizes this, and compensation at the Senior level reflects the outsized influence these engineers have on integration outcomes.

CEO Sergio Ermotti has made the integration timeline a board-level priority. Senior Engineers who can independently assess Credit Suisse legacy systems, design migration paths, and lead cutover execution are among the most sought-after hires in global banking technology. The combination of deep technical skill and financial-domain expertise required for this role creates a narrow talent pool — and UBS is competing aggressively with Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and major technology companies for these candidates.

Your negotiation leverage as a Senior Software Engineer is substantial. You are not a commodity hire — you are a strategic acquisition. Every month you accelerate the decommissioning of a Credit Suisse system translates into quantifiable savings that flow directly to UBS's bottom line. Frame your negotiation around this impact. Candidates who can articulate specific examples of large-scale migration work, legacy system modernization, or distributed systems architecture in regulated environments hold the strongest cards at the table.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

UBS's $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings target is not an abstract corporate goal — it is a quarterly-tracked, board-reported metric that directly shapes engineering compensation. Senior Software Engineers sit at the center of this savings engine. At this level, you are expected to own migration workstreams end-to-end: assessing Credit Suisse legacy systems, designing target-state architectures on UBS platforms, executing data migrations, and driving decommissioning to completion. Each successful decommissioning event releases hard-dollar savings that UBS attributes to specific engineering teams.

The integration involves thousands of applications across trading, wealth management, risk, and operations platforms. Millions of client accounts must be migrated without service disruption across jurisdictions with distinct regulatory requirements. Senior Engineers who navigate this complexity — balancing technical execution with regulatory compliance and business continuity — are the primary beneficiaries of the Efficiency-Impact bonus program.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** Senior Software Engineers can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $30K-$65K annually, layered on top of standard bonus and RSU compensation. These bonuses are directly tied to the measurable cost savings generated by systems you decommission or consolidate. Engineers leading high-value decommissioning projects — such as retiring redundant trading platforms or consolidating data warehouses — have received payouts at the top of this range.

- **Domain Ownership Multiplier:** Senior Engineers who own critical migration domains (e.g., risk systems, client onboarding, settlement platforms) receive a domain-ownership multiplier on their Efficiency-Impact bonus. Owning a domain with $10M+ in annual infrastructure costs positions you for the highest bonus tiers. Negotiate for domain ownership at the offer stage to maximize your Efficiency-Impact exposure.

- **Architectural Decision Authority:** Every architectural decision in the migration — build vs. migrate vs. decommission — carries financial implications. Senior Engineers who make these calls are accountable for the savings (or costs) they generate. This accountability is rewarded: engineers who consistently choose the most cost-effective migration path and execute it cleanly see their Efficiency-Impact bonuses grow year-over-year.

- **Retention Through Integration Window:** UBS is offering enhanced retention packages to Senior Engineers who commit to staying through the 2025-2027 critical integration window. These packages typically include an additional RSU grant of $25K-$50K/year and a guaranteed minimum Efficiency-Impact bonus floor. Negotiate for these retention terms at the offer stage — they are available but rarely offered proactively.

#### Global Levers

**1. Counter-Offer Escalation (Value: $25K-$50K)**
Senior Engineers receive aggressive counter-offers when they signal departure intent. Use a competing offer from Goldman Sachs, Citadel, or a FAANG company as leverage. Script: *"I've received an offer from [Competitor] at $[X] total comp. I believe UBS's integration work is the most impactful engineering challenge in banking right now, but the gap between offers is $45K. Can we close this with a combination of base increase and guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus?"*

**2. Signing Bonus for Migration Expertise (Value: $35K-$60K)**
Your migration-specific skills command a premium that standard comp bands may not capture. Push for a signing bonus that reflects the scarcity of your expertise. Script: *"My experience leading [specific migration/modernization project] maps directly to the CS integration workstreams. A $50K signing bonus reflects the ramp-time savings — I can begin contributing to decommissioning targets within weeks, not months."*

**3. RSU Acceleration for Integration Commitment (Value: $20K-$40K/year)**
Request accelerated RSU vesting or an increased RSU grant tied to integration milestones. Script: *"I'd like to structure the RSU component with an integration-milestone accelerator. If I deliver [specific system migration] ahead of schedule, the Year 2 vest accelerates to Year 1. This aligns my compensation with UBS's integration timeline and gives me skin in the game."*

**4. Title and Level Alignment (Value: $30K-$55K)**
UBS's VP title at the Senior Engineer level maps to high-earning tiers at competing banks. Ensure your level is correctly calibrated. Script: *"Based on my scope of ownership — I'll be leading migration for [X systems] across [Y teams] — I believe VP-level placement is appropriate. At Goldman, this scope maps to VP with a comp floor of $[X]. I want to ensure parity."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $310K TC for New York — the 75th percentile of the range. Lead with a specific migration case study from your background and quantify the savings or efficiency gains you delivered. Counter any initial offer below $275K by referencing the $2.8B savings target and your ability to own domain-level migration. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 273K / $310K and negotiate for dual-currency flexibility on the bonus component. For London, anchor at £248K / $310K. Your walk-away floor should be $260K TC (New York), CHF 229K / $260K (Zurich), or £208K / $260K (London). If the base is capped at band maximum, push for a $50K signing bonus, a guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus of $40K, and an additional $30K/year RSU retention grant. Get every migration-linked compensation element in writing before accepting.
