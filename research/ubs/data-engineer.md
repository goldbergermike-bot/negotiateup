#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at UBS are building the plumbing that makes the Credit Suisse integration possible. Every system migration, every client transfer, every platform consolidation ultimately depends on data being moved correctly — from the right source, through the right transformations, to the right target, with full lineage tracking and zero data loss. The $2.8 billion savings target cannot be achieved until Credit Suisse's data infrastructure is fully consolidated onto UBS platforms, and Data Engineers are the ones who make that happen.

The data engineering challenge at UBS is among the most complex in the world. Credit Suisse and UBS each maintained thousands of data pipelines, hundreds of ETL jobs, multiple data warehouses, and distinct data lake architectures. These must be rationalized into a unified data platform. Every client record, transaction history, risk metric, and regulatory report must be migrated with perfect fidelity. Data Engineers who can design and execute this consolidation — building scalable pipelines that handle the volume and variety of two major banks' data estates — are in extraordinary demand.

Your negotiation leverage is grounded in the critical-path nature of data engineering in the integration. No system can be decommissioned until its data has been migrated. No application can be retired until its data pipelines have been redirected. Data Engineers sit on the critical path of virtually every migration workstream, making them bottleneck resources whose capacity directly determines integration velocity. Candidates who bring experience with large-scale data migrations, financial data modeling, or real-time data pipeline architecture in regulated environments hold powerful negotiation cards.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

Data Engineers are on the critical path of UBS's $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings. No Credit Suisse system can be decommissioned until its data has been fully migrated to the UBS target platform. This means Data Engineers control the pace of decommissioning — and by extension, the pace of savings realization. Every data pipeline migrated, every ETL job consolidated, every data warehouse merged unlocks the ability to retire legacy Credit Suisse infrastructure and capture the associated cost savings.

The data estate being consolidated is enormous. Credit Suisse generated petabytes of data across trading, wealth management, risk, compliance, and operations. This data lives in multiple formats, across multiple storage systems, with varying levels of documentation and quality. Data Engineers must reverse-engineer legacy Credit Suisse data pipelines, design new pipelines on the UBS target architecture, validate data integrity through comprehensive reconciliation, and execute cutover migrations with zero data loss.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** Data Engineers can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $20K-$45K annually, directly tied to the number and complexity of data pipelines migrated and the resulting decommissioning of Credit Suisse data infrastructure. Engineers who lead the migration of high-volume, business-critical data pipelines (trading data, client portfolios, regulatory feeds) receive bonuses at the upper end.

- **Pipeline Migration Velocity Bonus:** Data Engineers who exceed their pipeline migration targets — migrating more pipelines per quarter than planned — receive a velocity bonus of $8K-$18K per quarter of acceleration. Faster pipeline migration directly unblocks system decommissioning, creating a multiplicative savings effect.

- **Data Quality Assurance Premium:** Data Engineers who achieve above-threshold data quality scores in migration validation — ensuring that migrated data matches source data with 99.99%+ accuracy — receive a quality premium of $10K-$20K. Data quality failures can block decommissioning entirely and create regulatory risk, making quality assurance one of the highest-value data engineering activities.

- **Legacy Pipeline Decommissioning Attribution:** Each Credit Suisse data pipeline that is decommissioned generates a direct savings event (eliminated compute, storage, licensing, and maintenance costs). Data Engineers who build replacement pipelines on UBS infrastructure and then drive the decommissioning of the Credit Suisse originals receive direct attribution for these savings, boosting their Efficiency-Impact bonus by $5K-$15K per major pipeline decommissioned.

#### Global Levers

**1. Data Platform Expertise Premium (Value: $15K-$28K)**
Specific platform expertise (Spark, Kafka, Snowflake, Databricks, Airflow) commands a premium. Script: *"My deep expertise in [Spark/Kafka/Snowflake/Databricks] maps directly to UBS's target data architecture. I've built and operated pipelines at [X TB/day] scale in production. A $20K platform expertise premium reflects the immediate productivity I'll deliver on the migration."*

**2. Critical Path Signing Bonus (Value: $18K-$32K)**
Data engineering is on the critical path of every migration workstream. Script: *"Data pipeline migration is the blocking dependency for every system decommissioning in the CS integration. I can start building migration pipelines within my first two weeks. A $25K signing bonus reflects the critical-path acceleration of having a productive Data Engineer from day one."*

**3. Data Migration Certification and Methodology (Value: $10K-$22K)**
If you bring a proven migration methodology, price it into the offer. Script: *"I've developed and refined a data migration methodology through [X] large-scale migrations at [previous companies]. This methodology reduces migration risk and accelerates delivery by [X]%. A $18K premium reflects the value of bringing a proven approach rather than building one from scratch."*

**4. RSU Uplift for Data Platform Commitment (Value: $10K-$22K/year)**
Commit to building the unified data platform in exchange for enhanced equity. Script: *"The unified data platform I'll build will be UBS's foundation for years beyond the CS integration. I'd like an additional $18K/year in RSUs tied to a 2-year commitment — reflecting the long-term strategic value of the data platform work."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $245K TC for New York — the 75th percentile of the range. Lead with quantified data migration experience — number of pipelines migrated, data volumes handled, and migration accuracy rates achieved. Counter any initial offer below $218K by citing the critical-path nature of data engineering in the integration — every delayed pipeline migration blocks system decommissioning and delays savings realization against the $2.8B target. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 216K / $245K. For London, anchor at £196K / $245K. Your walk-away floor should be $205K TC (New York), CHF 180K / $205K (Zurich), or £164K / $205K (London). Push for a $25K signing bonus, a guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus of $22K, and a platform expertise premium. Ensure your pipeline ownership scope is documented in writing.
