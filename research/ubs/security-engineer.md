#### Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at UBS during the Credit Suisse integration face one of the most challenging cybersecurity mandates in financial services. Merging two of the world's largest banks doubles the threat surface while simultaneously introducing thousands of migration-specific attack vectors. Every system migration, every data transfer, every API integration between Credit Suisse and UBS platforms creates a potential vulnerability that adversaries can exploit. Security Engineers who can secure the integration — maintaining regulatory compliance while enabling migration velocity — are among UBS's most critical hires.

The security challenge extends across every dimension of the integration. Network architectures must be consolidated without creating gaps. Identity and access management systems must be merged — ensuring that Credit Suisse employees receive appropriate UBS access without over-provisioning. Data loss prevention controls must span both environments during the transition period. Encryption, key management, and certificate infrastructure must be unified. And all of this must satisfy the security requirements of FINMA, the FCA, the SEC, and dozens of other regulatory bodies simultaneously.

Your negotiation leverage is amplified by the existential nature of security failures in banking. A security breach during the integration would be catastrophic — not just financially, but reputationally, at a moment when UBS is asking millions of Credit Suisse clients to trust the combined institution. UBS understands this risk and is willing to pay premium rates for Security Engineers who bring both deep technical security expertise and experience securing large-scale technology migrations in regulated environments.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

Security Engineers contribute to UBS's $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings by enabling faster, safer system decommissioning. Every Credit Suisse system that remains online — even if functionally redundant — continues to generate security costs: monitoring, patching, vulnerability management, compliance audits, and incident response coverage. Security Engineers who can clear systems for decommissioning quickly — validating that all security dependencies are resolved and all data has been securely migrated — directly accelerate the savings timeline.

The security dimension of the integration is massive. Credit Suisse and UBS maintained entirely separate security architectures: different SIEM platforms, different IAM systems, different network segmentation approaches, different encryption standards. Consolidating these into a unified security posture requires deep expertise across every security domain. Security Engineers who can drive this unification while maintaining continuous protection against threats are uniquely positioned for Efficiency-Impact bonuses.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** Security Engineers can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $28K-$58K annually, tied to the security-related savings generated by their work. Engineers who accelerate the decommissioning of redundant security infrastructure (duplicate SIEMs, overlapping WAFs, redundant DLP systems) receive bonuses at the upper end. The consolidation of security tooling alone can generate millions in license savings.

- **Security Clearance and Compliance Acceleration:** Security Engineers who expedite regulatory security reviews for migrated systems — obtaining FINMA, FCA, or SEC sign-off faster — receive a compliance acceleration bonus of $12K-$25K. Regulatory approval is often the final gate before decommissioning, and every week saved in the approval process accelerates savings realization.

- **Threat Surface Reduction Attribution:** As Credit Suisse systems are decommissioned, the combined organization's attack surface shrinks. Security Engineers who lead threat-surface reduction initiatives — systematically eliminating exposure by consolidating network perimeters, retiring legacy APIs, and unifying endpoint protection — receive a threat surface reduction bonus of $10K-$22K.

- **Zero-Incident Migration Premium:** Security Engineers who maintain zero security incidents during active migration cutovers — the highest-risk moments for security — receive a zero-incident premium of $8K-$18K per quarter. This reflects the enormous risk mitigation value of incident-free migration execution.

#### Global Levers

**1. Security Talent Scarcity Premium (Value: $22K-$42K)**
Cybersecurity talent with banking expertise is exceptionally scarce. Script: *"The intersection of cybersecurity expertise, financial services regulatory knowledge, and large-scale migration security experience is extraordinarily rare. I have competing interest from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto Networks/competing bank] at $[X]. A $32K increase to the offer reflects the market scarcity of this skill combination."*

**2. Security Architecture Signing Bonus (Value: $22K-$40K)**
Your ability to secure the integration from day one has immediate risk-reduction value. Script: *"Every day of the integration without unified security architecture is a day of elevated risk. I can begin designing the consolidated security architecture within my first week. A $32K signing bonus reflects the risk-reduction value of immediate security contribution."*

**3. Certification and Clearance Premium (Value: $10K-$22K)**
Security certifications (CISSP, CISM, OSCP) and clearances have tangible value. Script: *"My CISSP and [specific certification] represent $[X]K in training investment and qualify me to lead security reviews that satisfy FINMA and FCA requirements. I'd like a $15K certification premium that reflects this qualification advantage."*

**4. Regulatory Liaison Role Uplift (Value: $15K-$30K)**
If you'll be interfacing with regulators, negotiate for the expanded scope. Script: *"This role involves direct engagement with FINMA and FCA security auditors during the integration. Regulatory liaison work adds significant scope beyond standard security engineering. I'd like a $22K uplift that reflects the regulatory dimension of the role."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $280K TC for New York — the 75th percentile of the range. Lead with your security architecture experience in regulated environments and quantify the risk reduction you've delivered in previous migrations. Counter any initial offer below $250K by citing the existential risk of security failures during the integration — a breach during the CS migration would cost UBS orders of magnitude more than the premium they pay for top security talent. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 246K / $280K. For London, anchor at £224K / $280K. Your walk-away floor should be $235K TC (New York), CHF 207K / $235K (Zurich), or £188K / $235K (London). Push for a $32K signing bonus, a guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus of $30K, and a certification premium. Ensure your security domain ownership is documented in the offer.
