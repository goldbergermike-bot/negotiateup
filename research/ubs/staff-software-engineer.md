#### Negotiation DNA

The Staff Software Engineer at UBS occupies a position of extraordinary strategic influence during the Credit Suisse integration. This is not a coding role with a senior title — it is an architecture-level position where your technical decisions shape the trajectory of billions in IT savings. Staff Engineers at UBS set the technical direction for entire platform domains, make build-vs-migrate-vs-decommission decisions that carry multi-million-dollar implications, and serve as the technical authority that engineering managers and directors rely on to de-risk the integration.

UBS's integration challenge requires Staff Engineers who can see across both technology stacks — UBS's and Credit Suisse's — and make unified architectural decisions. This means evaluating thousands of applications, identifying redundancies, designing target-state architectures, and establishing migration patterns that can be replicated at scale. The $2.8 billion savings target depends on these decisions being made correctly and executed efficiently. A single poor architectural decision at this level can cost tens of millions in delayed decommissioning or failed migrations.

Your negotiation position as a Staff Engineer is among the strongest in the industry. The intersection of deep technical expertise, architecture-level judgment, and financial-domain knowledge required for this role exists in an exceptionally small talent pool. UBS is competing directly with Google, Meta, Amazon, and top-tier hedge funds for Staff-level talent. Candidates who bring specific experience in large-scale platform consolidation, distributed systems architecture, or regulated-environment migrations can command compensation at the upper end of the range — and beyond, when Efficiency-Impact bonuses are factored in.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

At the Staff Engineer level, the Efficiency-Impact bonus program reaches its highest leverage. UBS's $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings target is fundamentally an architecture problem — and Staff Engineers are the architects. Every decision about which Credit Suisse platform to absorb, which to rebuild on UBS infrastructure, and which to decommission entirely carries direct financial consequences that are tracked, measured, and attributed.

The integration involves consolidating Credit Suisse's entire technology estate: thousands of applications spanning trading systems, risk engines, client reporting platforms, regulatory reporting infrastructure, and back-office operations. Millions of accounts across dozens of jurisdictions must be migrated with zero tolerance for data loss or service disruption. Staff Engineers who navigate this complexity — making the right technical calls under time pressure and regulatory scrutiny — are the primary beneficiaries of UBS's most generous compensation levers.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** Staff Software Engineers can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $55K-$120K annually, representing the highest individual-contributor tier of the program. These bonuses are tied to the aggregate savings generated by the platform domains you own. Staff Engineers who lead the decommissioning of major Credit Suisse platforms — such as the legacy trading infrastructure or the risk management stack — have seen payouts exceeding $100K in a single year.

- **Architecture Decision Impact Accounting:** UBS has implemented a formal "Architecture Decision Record" (ADR) process for the integration, where every major technical decision is documented with its expected financial impact. Staff Engineers who own ADRs with $50M+ in projected savings receive the highest Efficiency-Impact multiplier. Negotiate for ownership of high-impact ADRs during the offer stage to maximize your bonus exposure.

- **Platform Consolidation Authority:** Staff Engineers who lead the consolidation of entire platform verticals (e.g., merging Credit Suisse and UBS wealth management platforms) receive a "Platform Authority" bonus tier that can add $30K-$50K beyond the standard Efficiency-Impact range. This tier is reserved for Staff-and-above engineers who own cross-organization consolidation.

- **Strategic Retention Package:** UBS is offering 3-year retention packages to Staff Engineers valued at $150K-$250K total (in addition to standard compensation), structured as deferred RSU grants that vest upon integration milestone completion. These packages are available but must be specifically negotiated — they are not included in standard offers. Candidates who signal long-term commitment to the integration timeline and ask for retention terms receive them.

#### Global Levers

**1. Competing Big Tech Offer (Value: $50K-$100K)**
Staff Engineer roles at Google, Meta, and Amazon pay $500K+ TC. Use a Big Tech offer as your primary anchor. Script: *"I have a Staff Engineer offer from [Google/Meta] at $[520K] total comp. UBS's integration challenge is uniquely compelling to me — the architecture problems are more complex and consequential than anything in consumer tech. But I need the total compensation to be within striking distance. Can we close the gap with a combination of base, RSU uplift, and a guaranteed Efficiency-Impact bonus floor?"*

**2. Architecture Authority Premium (Value: $40K-$75K)**
Your architecture-level decisions carry multi-million-dollar implications. Price this authority into your compensation. Script: *"At this level, my architectural decisions on the CS migration will directly determine whether UBS captures or loses tens of millions in savings. I'd like the compensation to reflect this accountability — specifically, a $60K uplift to the RSU grant and a guaranteed minimum Efficiency-Impact bonus of $55K in Year 1."*

**3. Dual-Role Hybrid (Value: $30K-$60K)**
Staff Engineers at UBS often operate as both technical architects and technical leaders of large teams. If you'll be doing both, negotiate for both. Script: *"The role description involves both architecture ownership and technical leadership of 30+ engineers. At competing firms, these are separate roles each compensated at Director level. I'd like the offer to reflect the dual nature of this position — either through increased base or an additional leadership RSU component."*

**4. Integration Completion Bonus (Value: $75K-$150K)**
Negotiate for a one-time integration completion bonus payable when your platform domain's migration is fully executed. Script: *"I'd like to include an integration completion bonus of $125K, payable upon successful decommissioning of the [Credit Suisse platform domain]. This aligns my incentives perfectly with UBS's savings targets and demonstrates my commitment to seeing the migration through."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $450K TC for New York — the 80th percentile of the range. Lead with a Big Tech competing offer if available, or anchor against Goldman Sachs Executive Director compensation ($420K-$500K TC). Counter any initial offer below $400K by referencing the architecture-level impact you'll have on the $2.8B savings target. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 396K / $450K and negotiate for the bonus component to be paid in USD for currency stability. For London, anchor at £360K / $450K. Your walk-away floor should be $370K TC (New York), CHF 326K / $370K (Zurich), or £296K / $370K (London). Push hard for the strategic retention package ($150K-$250K over 3 years) and a guaranteed Efficiency-Impact bonus floor of $55K. At Staff level, everything is negotiable — base band exceptions, RSU refreshes, signing bonuses, and integration completion bonuses. Get every element in writing with explicit milestone triggers.
