#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at UBS are the infrastructure backbone of the Credit Suisse integration. The merger of two of the world's largest banking technology estates requires consolidating data centers, unifying CI/CD pipelines, merging container orchestration platforms, harmonizing monitoring stacks, and decommissioning thousands of redundant servers and services. Every infrastructure component you consolidate or decommission directly reduces operating costs and contributes to the $2.8 billion savings target.

The DevOps challenge at UBS is uniquely demanding because banking infrastructure must maintain regulatory-grade reliability during the transition. You cannot simply lift-and-shift Credit Suisse workloads — each migration must be planned, tested, and executed with zero tolerance for downtime in production trading, settlement, and client-facing systems. DevOps Engineers who can maintain 99.99%+ uptime while simultaneously executing aggressive infrastructure consolidation are among the most valuable hires in the integration.

Your negotiation leverage comes from the direct, measurable relationship between DevOps work and cost savings. Every data center decommissioned, every redundant monitoring stack eliminated, every CI/CD pipeline consolidated translates into hard-dollar savings that UBS tracks quarterly. Unlike application engineering, where savings attribution can be complex, infrastructure decommissioning generates clear, auditable cost reductions. This makes DevOps Engineers uniquely positioned to quantify their Efficiency-Impact bonus potential at the negotiation table.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

DevOps Engineers are the most directly measurable contributors to UBS's $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings. Infrastructure costs — data center operations, cloud compute, networking, storage, licensing — represent the largest category of IT spending that the Credit Suisse integration can reduce. Every server rack decommissioned, every cloud account consolidated, every redundant monitoring license terminated generates a savings event that is immediately visible on UBS's financial statements.

The infrastructure estate being consolidated is massive. Credit Suisse operated dozens of data centers globally, ran thousands of production servers, and maintained separate cloud footprints across AWS, Azure, and on-premises environments. UBS's target architecture requires rationalizing all of this into a unified infrastructure platform. DevOps Engineers who can plan and execute this consolidation — while maintaining production stability — are the primary drivers of infrastructure savings.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** DevOps Engineers can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $20K-$48K annually, directly tied to the infrastructure cost savings generated by their consolidation work. Engineers who lead data center decommissioning projects or major cloud migration workstreams consistently receive bonuses at the upper end. The attribution is clear and auditable — a decommissioned data center with $5M/year in operating costs generates a direct savings event.

- **Infrastructure Decommissioning Velocity Bonus:** DevOps Engineers who exceed their infrastructure decommissioning targets — shutting down more Credit Suisse infrastructure components ahead of schedule — receive a velocity bonus of $8K-$20K per quarter of acceleration. This reflects the compounding savings effect: every month of early decommissioning eliminates a month of redundant operating costs.

- **CI/CD Consolidation Premium:** Engineers who unify the Credit Suisse and UBS CI/CD pipelines receive a consolidation premium of $10K-$22K. Unified pipelines accelerate all downstream migration work by enabling engineers across the organization to deploy to the target architecture more efficiently. This multiplicative impact is recognized with a premium-tier bonus.

- **Reliability During Migration SLA Bonus:** DevOps Engineers who maintain above-SLA uptime during active migration cutover events — the highest-risk moments in the integration — receive a reliability bonus of $8K-$18K per quarter. This reflects the risk mitigation value of operational excellence during the most dangerous phase of infrastructure consolidation.

#### Global Levers

**1. Cloud Platform Expertise Premium (Value: $15K-$30K)**
Specific cloud expertise (AWS, Azure, GCP) is in high demand for the migration. Script: *"My [AWS Solutions Architect Professional / Azure Expert / GCP Cloud Architect] certification and [X years] of production cloud experience directly apply to the CS infrastructure migration. I'd like a $20K premium on the base to reflect this specialized expertise — it reduces UBS's ramp time for cloud migration workstreams."*

**2. Infrastructure Savings Quantification (Value: $18K-$35K)**
Your previous infrastructure consolidation work likely generated quantifiable savings. Lead with numbers. Script: *"At [previous company], I led the decommissioning of [X servers / Y data center racks / Z cloud accounts], generating $[X]M in annual savings. I expect to deliver similar or greater impact at UBS given the scale of the CS infrastructure estate. A $28K increase to total comp reflects the proven savings I'll deliver."*

**3. On-Call and Migration Cutover Premium (Value: $12K-$22K)**
Migration cutovers happen during off-hours. Negotiate for the additional time commitment. Script: *"The CS migration will require weekend and off-hours cutover events. I'd like to include a $18K migration cutover premium that recognizes the additional on-call commitment during the integration window."*

**4. Signing Bonus for Immediate Availability (Value: $18K-$35K)**
Infrastructure consolidation benefits from immediate starts. Script: *"I can start within two weeks and begin contributing to infrastructure decommissioning immediately. Given that every month of delay on infrastructure consolidation costs UBS millions in redundant operating costs, a $28K signing bonus reflects the value of fast onboarding."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $240K TC for New York — the 75th percentile of the range. Lead with quantified infrastructure savings from previous roles and specific cloud/infrastructure certifications. Counter any initial offer below $215K by citing the direct relationship between DevOps work and the $2.8B savings target — infrastructure costs are the largest savings category. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 211K / $240K and push for the on-call premium to be denominated in USD. For London, anchor at £192K / $240K. Your walk-away floor should be $205K TC (New York), CHF 180K / $205K (Zurich), or £164K / $205K (London). Push for a $28K signing bonus, a guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus of $25K, and a documented migration cutover premium. Get infrastructure decommissioning targets and associated bonus tiers in writing.
