#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at UBS are the operational nerve center of the Credit Suisse integration. The largest banking technology merger in history requires someone to orchestrate the moving pieces — coordinating across dozens of engineering teams, managing dependencies between migration workstreams, tracking delivery against aggressive timelines, and escalating risks before they become blockers. That someone is the TPM. Your ability to keep the integration on track directly determines whether UBS captures the $2.8 billion in savings on schedule or watches costs compound from delays.

The integration program is staggeringly complex. Thousands of Credit Suisse systems must be assessed, migrated, and decommissioned. Hundreds of engineering teams across New York, Zurich, London, and offshore locations must be coordinated. Regulatory milestones, client migration windows, and business continuity requirements create a web of constraints that only a skilled TPM can navigate. CEO Sergio Ermotti's integration timeline depends on TPMs who can identify the critical path, remove blockers, and drive cross-functional alignment at velocity.

Your negotiation leverage as a TPM stems from the fact that integration programs succeed or fail on program management quality. Exceptional TPMs accelerate timelines by weeks or months — and in an integration where every month of delay costs tens of millions in redundant operating costs, that acceleration is worth real money. Candidates with experience managing M&A integration programs, large-scale platform migrations, or multi-team technology delivery in regulated environments hold the strongest negotiation position.

#### CS Migration — The Efficiency-Impact Premium

Technical Program Managers are the operational architects of UBS's $2.8 billion IT decommissioning savings program. While engineers and architects focus on technical execution, TPMs ensure that the integration program — in its entirety — delivers against the savings timeline. Every dependency managed, every blocker removed, every timeline accelerated translates into earlier decommissioning and faster savings realization. UBS tracks program velocity as a primary leading indicator of savings delivery, and TPMs who move the needle on velocity are rewarded through the Efficiency-Impact bonus program.

The program management challenge spans the full breadth of the integration. Thousands of migration tasks must be sequenced, resourced, and tracked. Cross-team dependencies — where one team's migration blocks another team's decommissioning — must be identified and resolved proactively. Regulatory approval gates, client communication windows, and business continuity requirements add layers of constraint that demand sophisticated program planning. TPMs who can hold this complexity in their heads and keep the program moving forward are the difference between on-time and delayed savings delivery.

- **Efficiency-Impact Bonus Range:** Technical Program Managers can expect Efficiency-Impact bonuses of $22K-$48K annually, tied to the on-time delivery of migration milestones within their program scope. TPMs who manage programs that achieve ahead-of-schedule delivery consistently receive bonuses at the upper end. The bonus is calculated based on the aggregate savings enabled by on-time (or early) milestone completion within the TPM's program.

- **Critical Path Acceleration Bonus:** TPMs who identify and eliminate critical-path bottlenecks that accelerate the overall program timeline receive an acceleration bonus of $10K-$22K per quarter of acceleration. A single critical-path improvement that pulls forward the decommissioning of a major Credit Suisse system by one quarter can generate millions in savings — and the TPM who drove that improvement is directly attributed.

- **Cross-Team Dependency Resolution Premium:** TPMs who proactively resolve cross-team dependencies — unblocking engineering teams before delays cascade — receive a dependency resolution premium of $8K-$18K. This reflects the multiplicative impact of dependency management: a single unresolved dependency can delay multiple downstream workstreams, compounding costs exponentially.

- **Program Reporting and Visibility Bonus:** TPMs who maintain executive-grade program reporting — providing CEO-level visibility into integration progress, risks, and savings realization — receive a reporting premium of $5K-$12K. This reflects the strategic value of transparency: executives who can see program status in real-time make better resource allocation decisions, which accelerates the overall integration.

#### Global Levers

**1. M&A Integration Program Experience (Value: $18K-$35K)**
TPMs with M&A integration experience are rare and valuable. Script: *"I managed the technology integration program for the [specific M&A] at [previous company], coordinating [X teams] and delivering [Y milestones] on schedule. This directly applicable experience is worth a $25K premium — I'll be operational on the CS integration program within weeks, not months."*

**2. Program Scope Premium (Value: $15K-$30K)**
If your program scope exceeds standard TPM bandwidth, negotiate for the expanded scope. Script: *"This role involves managing 5 concurrent migration workstreams across 12 engineering teams in 3 locations. This scope exceeds a typical TPM role by 2x. I'd like the compensation to reflect the actual program complexity — a $22K increase to base brings the offer in line with the scope."*

**3. Signing Bonus for Program Continuity (Value: $18K-$32K)**
Integration programs suffer when TPMs change mid-stream. Your continuity has value. Script: *"Starting a new TPM mid-integration creates a knowledge transfer cost of months. I can provide continuity from day one by applying my integration program methodology immediately. A $25K signing bonus reflects the continuity value."*

**4. Milestone-Linked Bonus Escalation (Value: $12K-$28K)**
Negotiate for your Efficiency-Impact bonus to escalate with each major milestone delivered on time. Script: *"I'd like the Efficiency-Impact bonus to include an escalation clause: $15K for on-time delivery of the first major milestone, $20K for the second, and $25K for the third. This rewards sustained program execution and aligns my incentives with the integration timeline."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your initial counter at $252K TC for New York — the 75th percentile of the range. Lead with quantified program management outcomes from M&A integrations or large-scale migrations. Counter any initial offer below $230K by citing the program scope — the number of workstreams, teams, and locations you'll coordinate — and the direct relationship between program velocity and the $2.8B savings target. For Zurich, anchor at CHF 222K / $252K. For London, anchor at £202K / $252K. Your walk-away floor should be $215K TC (New York), CHF 189K / $215K (Zurich), or £172K / $215K (London). Push for a $25K signing bonus, a guaranteed Year 1 Efficiency-Impact bonus of $22K, and a milestone-linked bonus escalation clause. Ensure program scope and milestone definitions are documented in the offer.
