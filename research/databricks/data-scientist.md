### Data Scientist | Databricks Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | Lakehouse AI Platform | Rumored 2026 IPO | $62B+ Valuation | **30% MORE SHARES BEFORE LISTING**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options+RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $188K–$238K | $182K–$322K | 15–20% | $262K–$368K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Databricks Data Scientists build the analytical and ML models that prove the Lakehouse AI platform's value to 10,000+ enterprise customers — developing the reference architectures, benchmark analyses, and ML workflows on Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, and Mosaic AI that demonstrate why unified data+AI is superior to legacy data warehouse approaches. At IC3-IC4, your models and analyses directly drive customer adoption, platform credibility, and the data-driven insights that shape product direction — every analysis you produce impacts the $62B+ valuation trajectory heading into the rumored 2026 IPO. Pre-IPO equity is the highest-leverage comp component — candidates should negotiate for 30% more shares before the public listing locks in the price. [Source: Databricks DS Comp 2025-2026]

**IPO Window — The 30% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation**

As a Data Scientist joining before the rumored 2026 IPO, your analytical models and ML workflows directly demonstrate the platform value that drives customer adoption and IPO valuation. "As a Data Scientist joining before the 2026 IPO, I want 30% more shares than the standard offer. My models and analyses directly prove the Lakehouse AI platform's value to enterprise customers at the $62B+ valuation. Pre-IPO data science equity has strong leverage because my work drives the customer adoption and platform credibility that investors will value at listing."

**Global Levers**

1. **30% More Shares + Analytical Impact:** "I build the analytical models and ML workflows proving the Lakehouse AI platform's value at the $62B+ valuation. 30% more shares than standard — my data science work drives customer adoption heading into the 2026 IPO."
2. **Platform Value Demonstration:** "I develop the reference architectures and benchmark analyses on Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, and Mosaic AI that prove the Lakehouse platform's superiority. My work directly drives enterprise customer adoption and expansion."
3. **Snowflake/Google DS Parity + IPO Premium:** "Snowflake Data Scientists earn $368K+ TC with liquid equity. Google DS L4 earns $378K+ TC. Databricks must offer 30% more pre-IPO shares to attract data science talent from public companies."
4. **Data Intelligence Engine Validation:** "I validate and demonstrate the Data Intelligence Engine's capabilities — the AI-native analytics that make Databricks the enterprise AI platform of record. My analytical proof points are the customer adoption driver that justifies the $62B+ valuation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $235K base and 30% more shares than the standard equity offer for this Data Scientist role before the 2026 IPO. I build the analytical models and ML workflows proving the Lakehouse AI platform's value — my work directly drives customer adoption underpinning the $62B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Snowflake DS at $368K TC / Google DS L4 at $378K TC / Meta DS at $372K TC]. Pre-IPO data science equity at Databricks has asymmetric upside — my analyses directly drive platform credibility and adoption." Accept at $218K+ base and 20%+ more shares than standard.
