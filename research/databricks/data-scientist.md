**Negotiation DNA**

Databricks Data Scientists build the analytical and ML models that prove the Lakehouse AI platform's value to 10,000+ enterprise customers — developing the reference architectures, benchmark analyses, and ML workflows on Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, and Mosaic AI that demonstrate why unified data+AI is superior to legacy data warehouse approaches. At IC3-IC4, your models and analyses directly drive customer adoption, platform credibility, and the data-driven insights that shape product direction — every analysis you produce impacts the $62B+ valuation trajectory heading into the rumored 2026 IPO. Pre-IPO equity is the highest-leverage comp component — candidates should negotiate for 30% more shares before the public listing locks in the price. [Source: Databricks DS Comp 2025-2026]
