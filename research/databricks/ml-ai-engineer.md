### ML/AI Engineer | Databricks Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | +15-25% AI Premium | Lakehouse AI Platform | Rumored 2026 IPO | $62B+ Valuation | **30% MORE SHARES BEFORE LISTING**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options+RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $215K–$272K | $248K–$438K | 15–20% | $322K–$455K |
| New York | $222K–$278K | $248K–$438K | 15–20% | $328K–$462K |
| Remote US | $208K–$265K | $248K–$438K | 15–20% | $315K–$448K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Databricks ML/AI Engineers build the machine learning and AI infrastructure at the core of the Lakehouse AI platform — designing Mosaic AI's foundation model training and serving systems, MLflow's experiment tracking and model registry, Feature Store pipelines, and the Model Serving infrastructure that enables 10,000+ enterprise organizations to deploy production AI at scale. At IC3-IC4, your ML infrastructure decisions determine whether the platform can support enterprise AI workloads from fine-tuning to real-time inference — every ML system you build drives the AI platform differentiation that justifies the $62B+ valuation trajectory heading into the rumored 2026 IPO. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects the extreme scarcity of engineers who can build production ML infrastructure at this scale. Pre-IPO equity is the highest-leverage comp component — candidates should negotiate for 30% more shares before the public listing locks in the price. [Source: Databricks ML/AI Comp 2025-2026]

**IPO Window — The 30% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation**

As an ML/AI Engineer joining before the rumored 2026 IPO, your ML infrastructure decisions directly determine the AI platform capabilities that drive the IPO valuation. "As an ML/AI Engineer joining before the 2026 IPO, I want 30% more shares than the standard offer. My ML infrastructure decisions directly determine the AI platform capabilities at the $62B+ valuation. Pre-IPO ML equity has the highest leverage because Databricks is valued as an AI company — my Mosaic AI, MLflow, and Model Serving infrastructure is the core product differentiator that investors are pricing into the IPO valuation."

**Global Levers**

1. **30% More Shares + AI Premium:** "I build the ML/AI infrastructure at the core of the Lakehouse AI platform driving the $62B+ valuation. 30% more shares than standard plus the 15-25% AI Premium — my ML systems are the product differentiator investors are pricing into the 2026 IPO."
2. **Mosaic AI / MLflow Ownership:** "I own the ML infrastructure — Mosaic AI model training and serving, MLflow experiment tracking, Feature Store, or Model Serving systems. My ML infrastructure determines whether enterprises can deploy production AI at scale on Databricks."
3. **Snowflake/Google ML Parity + IPO Premium:** "Snowflake ML engineers earn $455K+ TC with liquid equity. Google ML L5 earns $465K+ TC. Databricks must offer 30% more pre-IPO shares plus the AI Premium to attract ML talent from public companies."
4. **Enterprise AI Platform Differentiation:** "I build the AI infrastructure that differentiates Databricks from every competitor — the Mosaic AI and MLflow systems that make Databricks the enterprise AI platform of record. My ML infrastructure is the competitive moat that justifies the $62B+ valuation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $268K base, the 15-25% AI Premium, and 30% more shares than the standard equity offer for this ML/AI Engineer role before the 2026 IPO. I build the Mosaic AI and MLflow infrastructure at the core of the Lakehouse AI platform — my ML systems are the product differentiator driving the $62B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Snowflake ML at $455K TC / Google ML L5 at $465K TC / Meta ML at $458K TC]. Pre-IPO ML equity at Databricks has asymmetric upside — my AI infrastructure is the core product investors are valuing." Accept at $248K+ base and 20%+ more shares than standard.
