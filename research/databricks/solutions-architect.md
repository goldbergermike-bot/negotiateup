At SA2-SA3, your technical designs and proof-of-concept implementations directly drive enterprise deal sizes, customer expansion, and platform adoption — every architecture you deliver impacts ARR growth and the $62B+ valuation trajectory heading into the rumored 2026 IPO. Pre-IPO equity is the highest-leverage comp component — candidates should negotiate for 30% more shares before the public listing locks in the price. [Source: Databricks SA Comp 2025-2026]
