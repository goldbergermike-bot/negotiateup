**Negotiation DNA**

Databricks Security Engineers protect the Lakehouse AI platform that processes exabytes of the most sensitive enterprise data in the world — building the security architecture, encryption systems, access controls, vulnerability management, and compliance frameworks across Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, and Mosaic AI that make Databricks trusted by Fortune 500 companies and regulated industries. At IC3-IC4, your security decisions determine whether enterprises trust Databricks with their most critical data and AI workloads — every security capability you ship directly impacts enterprise adoption and the $62B+ valuation trajectory heading into the rumored 2026 IPO. Pre-IPO equity is the highest-leverage comp component — candidates should negotiate for 30% more shares before the public listing locks in the price. [Source: Databricks Security Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Databricks Security (IC3-IC4) = Snowflake Security = Google Security L4-L5 = Meta Security (E4-E5) = Amazon SecEng L5-L6 = Microsoft Security 62-63

**IPO Window — The 30% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation**

As a Security Engineer joining before the rumored 2026 IPO, your security architecture directly determines the enterprise trust that drives customer adoption and IPO valuation. "As a Security Engineer joining before the 2026 IPO, I want 30% more shares than the standard offer. My security architecture directly determines enterprise trust at the $62B+ valuation. Pre-IPO security equity has strong leverage because enterprise customers will not adopt a data+AI platform they do not trust — and my security capabilities are the prerequisite for every dollar of enterprise ARR that investors value at listing."

**Global Levers**

1. **30% More Shares + Security Trust Impact:** "I build the security architecture that makes enterprises trust the Lakehouse AI platform at the $62B+ valuation. 30% more shares than standard — my security decisions are the prerequisite for enterprise adoption heading into the 2026 IPO."
2. **Enterprise Security & Compliance Ownership:** "I own the security posture for the platform processing exabytes of the most sensitive enterprise data — encryption, access controls, vulnerability management, and compliance frameworks across Delta Lake and Unity Catalog."
3. **Snowflake/Google Security Parity + IPO Premium:** "Snowflake Security engineers earn $382K+ TC with liquid equity. Google Security L4 earns $392K+ TC. Databricks must offer 30% more pre-IPO shares to attract security talent from public companies."
4. **IPO-Readiness Security Posture:** "I build the security and compliance posture required for IPO-readiness — SOC 2, FedRAMP, HIPAA, and the enterprise security certifications that public companies require. My security architecture ensures Databricks meets the trust bar investors and regulated customers demand."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base and 30% more shares than the standard equity offer for this Security Engineer role before the 2026 IPO. I build the security architecture that makes enterprises trust the Lakehouse AI platform — my security decisions are the prerequisite for every dollar of ARR underpinning the $62B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Snowflake Security at $382K TC / Google Security L4 at $392K TC / Amazon SecEng at $385K TC]. Pre-IPO security equity at Databricks has asymmetric upside — my security architecture directly enables enterprise adoption." Accept at $228K+ base and 20%+ more shares than standard.
