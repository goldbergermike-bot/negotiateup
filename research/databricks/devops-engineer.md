### DevOps / Platform Engineer | Databricks Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity Play | Lakehouse AI Platform | Rumored 2026 IPO | $62B+ Valuation | **30% MORE SHARES BEFORE LISTING**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Options+RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $168K–$212K | $152K–$268K | 10–15% | $225K–$315K |
| New York | $175K–$218K | $152K–$268K | 10–15% | $232K–$322K |
| Remote US | $162K–$205K | $152K–$268K | 10–15% | $218K–$308K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Databricks DevOps Engineers build and maintain the infrastructure that keeps the Lakehouse AI platform running at enterprise scale — owning the CI/CD pipelines, multi-cloud deployment automation, infrastructure-as-code, monitoring, and reliability systems that ensure 99.99% uptime for 10,000+ organizations processing exabytes of data. At IC2-IC3, your infrastructure decisions determine whether the platform can scale reliably across AWS, Azure, and GCP — and every reliability improvement you ship directly impacts customer trust and the $62B+ valuation trajectory heading into the rumored 2026 IPO. Pre-IPO equity is the highest-leverage comp component — candidates should negotiate for 30% more shares before the public listing locks in the price. [Source: Databricks DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Databricks DevOps (IC2-IC3) = Snowflake DevOps = Google SRE L3-L4 = Meta Production Eng (E4) = Amazon SysDE L4-L5 = Microsoft DevOps 60-61

**IPO Window — The 30% Pre-Listing Share Negotiation**

As a DevOps Engineer joining before the rumored 2026 IPO, your infrastructure and reliability decisions directly determine the platform stability that enterprise customers require. "As a DevOps Engineer joining before the 2026 IPO, I want 30% more shares than the standard offer. My infrastructure decisions directly determine platform reliability at the $62B+ valuation. Pre-IPO DevOps equity has strong leverage because platform uptime and reliability are prerequisites for the enterprise customer trust that investors value at listing."

**Global Levers**

1. **30% More Shares + Infrastructure Impact:** "I build the infrastructure keeping the Lakehouse AI platform reliable at the $62B+ valuation. 30% more shares than standard — my deployment and reliability decisions directly impact platform uptime heading into the 2026 IPO."
2. **Multi-Cloud Platform Reliability:** "I own the multi-cloud infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP — the CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, and monitoring that ensure 99.99% uptime for 10,000+ enterprise organizations."
3. **Snowflake/Google DevOps Parity + IPO Premium:** "Snowflake DevOps engineers earn $315K+ TC with liquid equity. Google SRE L4 earns $325K+ TC. Databricks must offer 30% more pre-IPO shares to attract infrastructure talent from public companies."
4. **IPO-Readiness Infrastructure:** "I build the infrastructure for IPO-readiness — the reliability, security, and compliance systems that public companies require. My infrastructure decisions ensure the Lakehouse AI platform meets the operational bar investors expect at listing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $208K base and 30% more shares than the standard equity offer for this DevOps Engineer role before the 2026 IPO. I build the multi-cloud infrastructure keeping the Lakehouse AI platform reliable — my deployment and monitoring decisions directly impact the platform uptime underpinning the $62B+ valuation. I have competing offers from [Snowflake DevOps at $315K TC / Google SRE L4 at $325K TC / Amazon SysDE at $318K TC]. Pre-IPO DevOps equity at Databricks has asymmetric upside — my infrastructure decisions directly drive platform reliability." Accept at $195K+ base and 20%+ more shares than standard.
