**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Melio protect one of fintech's most consequential attack surfaces. A platform processing $100B+ in B2B payments for 500,000+ SMBs is a high-value target for fraud, social engineering, account takeover, and payment diversion attacks. The stakes are existential — a major security breach at Melio would not only damage the company but could devastate the small businesses that depend on the platform for their daily cash-flow operations. Security Engineers must maintain PCI-DSS compliance, implement robust authentication and authorization frameworks, protect banking partner integrations, and build fraud detection systems that operate at scale without creating friction for legitimate SMB users.

The introduction of Agent Mel — Melio's AI agent for automated AP/AR — creates an entirely new threat surface that Security Engineers must address. An autonomous agent that can initiate payments, process invoices, and manage vendor relationships on behalf of SMBs introduces risks around prompt injection, model manipulation, unauthorized payment authorization, and data exfiltration through AI interfaces. The SMB Empowerment premium for security means building trust systems that allow small business owners to confidently delegate financial operations to an AI agent while maintaining guardrails that prevent automated systems from being weaponized. Securing automated cash-flow tasks requires a new security paradigm that blends traditional fintech security with AI safety.

Melio's Tel Aviv presence is particularly relevant for Security Engineers — Israel's cybersecurity ecosystem is world-class, and Melio benefits from this talent pool. Compensation includes options on a 4-year vesting schedule (private company, backed by Accel, Bessemer, and Coatue at a peak $4B valuation). Security Engineers with fintech and AI security experience command premium compensation, and the scarcity of professionals who understand both payment security and AI agent safety gives candidates significant negotiating leverage.

### Agent Mel — The SMB Empowerment Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Mel AI Security Architecture:** "Agent Mel introduces AI-specific security risks — prompt injection, model manipulation, unauthorized payment authorization through AI interfaces. I've built security architectures for AI-powered financial systems that address these exact threats. Securing an autonomous agent that manages AP/AR for 500,000+ SMBs requires specialized expertise that few security engineers possess. I'm asking for a base of $200K to reflect this AI security specialization."

**Lever 2 — $100B+ Processing Security Responsibility:** "Protecting $100B+ in payment processing from fraud, breach, and compliance violations is a responsibility that carries regulatory and reputational consequences. A single incident at this scale can trigger regulatory investigations, partner contract terminations, and loss of SMB trust. My track record of maintaining zero major breaches at comparable payment volumes is directly valuable to Melio. I'd like options worth $80K annualized to reflect this risk-mitigation contribution."

**Lever 3 — SMB Empowerment Trust Infrastructure:** "The SMB Empowerment mission depends on small business owners trusting Melio with their most sensitive financial data and their automated cash-flow operations. I build trust infrastructure — authentication systems, authorization frameworks, encryption at rest and in transit, and security transparency features that give SMB owners confidence. I'm requesting a $20K signing bonus for the immediate trust and compliance improvements I'll deliver."

**Lever 4 — Banking Partner Security Compliance:** "Melio's partnerships with major banks require meeting stringent security standards — SOC 2, PCI-DSS, partner-specific security assessments, and ongoing compliance monitoring. I've led security compliance programs at fintech companies with similar banking partnerships and can accelerate Melio's compliance posture. I'd like an annual equity refresh of at least $30K and a commitment to security conference and training budget."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $290,000-$325,000 total compensation in New York by anchoring on $195K-$210K base, securing $70K-$85K in annualized options, and negotiating a $20K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $250,000 total comp with a $175K minimum base. In Tel Aviv, target ₪920,000+ total comp (Tel Aviv's cybersecurity talent pool commands premium rates). For Remote US, accept no more than a 5% geographic discount — security talent is scarce and location-independent. Negotiate for: security tool procurement budget authority, annual equity refreshes, 409A disclosure, and a written commitment to dedicated security headcount growth.
