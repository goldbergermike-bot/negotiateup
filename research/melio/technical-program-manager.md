**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Melio drive the execution machinery behind one of fintech's most ambitious platforms. With $100B+ in cumulative payment processing and 500,000+ SMBs depending on the platform daily, the TPM role requires orchestrating complex, cross-functional programs that span payments engineering, compliance, banking partnerships, and product development. Melio's dual-hub engineering organization (New York and Tel Aviv) adds a layer of coordination complexity that makes TPMs indispensable — they are the connective tissue that ensures distributed teams deliver cohesive products that serve small businesses reliably.

The Agent Mel initiative — Melio's AI agent for automated AP/AR — represents the highest-complexity program the company has ever undertaken. TPMs are responsible for coordinating the concurrent workstreams that Agent Mel requires: AI/ML model development, payment workflow automation, accounting system integration, compliance review, and user experience design. The SMB Empowerment premium for TPMs means that program execution directly determines whether 500,000+ small businesses gain access to AI-powered tools that automate repetitive cash-flow tasks. Missed deadlines or poorly sequenced launches don't just delay features — they delay the financial empowerment of real business owners.

Melio compensates TPMs with options on a 4-year vesting schedule as a private company backed by Accel, Bessemer, and Coatue at a peak $4B valuation. TPMs should evaluate the options grant by considering the company's trajectory toward liquidity events and the value of the program portfolio they would manage. The $100B processing milestone and Agent Mel launch signal strong product momentum, but illiquidity means TPMs should negotiate for higher base compensation and signing bonuses to front-load guaranteed earnings.

### Agent Mel — The SMB Empowerment Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Mel Program Leadership:** "Agent Mel is the most complex program in Melio's history — coordinating AI/ML development, payment automation, accounting integrations, compliance approvals, and UX design across New York and Tel Aviv teams. I've led comparable multi-workstream programs at fintech companies, delivering AI-powered products to market on time and within scope. This program complexity justifies a base of $195K, up from the offered $170K."

**Lever 2 — $100B+ Processing Program Risk Management:** "Programs that touch $100B+ in payment processing carry outsized risk — a poorly managed migration or integration launch can disrupt cash flow for 500,000+ SMBs. I bring a structured approach to risk identification, mitigation planning, and stakeholder communication that has prevented critical incidents during high-risk financial platform releases. I'd like options worth $75K annualized to reflect the risk management value I bring."

**Lever 3 — SMB Empowerment Cross-Hub Coordination:** "Melio's dual-hub structure means the SMB Empowerment mission requires flawless coordination between New York and Tel Aviv teams to automate repetitive cash-flow tasks for small businesses. I have direct experience managing distributed engineering programs across US and Israel offices, including managing timezone handoffs, cultural communication styles, and delivery cadence alignment. I'm requesting a $18K signing bonus for this immediate coordination value."

**Lever 4 — Banking Partner Program Interface:** "Melio's major bank partnerships require program management that bridges internal engineering timelines with external partner milestones, compliance reviews, and certification processes. I've managed technical programs with banking partners that involved multi-month certification cycles and regulatory coordination. I'd like an annual equity refresh commitment of at least $30K to retain this partner-facing program expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $280,000-$315,000 total compensation in New York by pushing base to $190K-$205K, securing options worth $65K-$80K annualized, and negotiating an $18K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $240,000 total comp with a $170K minimum base. In Tel Aviv, target ₪900,000+ total comp. For Remote US, accept no more than a 6% geographic discount. Negotiate for: program scope definition in the offer letter (which programs you will lead), annual equity refreshes, 409A disclosure, and travel budget for cross-hub coordination between New York and Tel Aviv.
