**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Melio hold a uniquely impactful position: they are responsible for making B2B payments — a historically complex, opaque process — feel simple and trustworthy for 500,000+ small business owners. Unlike consumer fintech where design conventions are well established, B2B payment design requires solving for multi-stakeholder workflows (vendors, accountants, business owners), regulatory constraints, and the emotional weight of moving real money. Melio's $100B+ processing milestone was achieved in part because its design made free ACH transfers and vendor payments accessible to non-technical SMB owners who previously relied on paper checks.

The introduction of Agent Mel — Melio's AI agent for automated AP/AR — creates an entirely new design challenge: how do you build trust in an autonomous agent that makes financial decisions on behalf of a small business? Product Designers at Melio must define the interaction patterns for AI-assisted workflows — how Agent Mel surfaces recommendations, requests approvals, and reports on automated cash-flow actions. The SMB Empowerment premium for designers means creating interfaces that make SMB owners feel in control while automating repetitive cash-flow tasks. This is a rare design problem that combines AI interaction design with high-stakes financial UX.

Melio compensates with options on a 4-year vesting schedule, reflecting its status as a private company backed by Accel, Bessemer, and Coatue at a peak $4B valuation. Product Designers should evaluate their offers against public fintech peers (Block, Bill.com) while recognizing that Melio's design team is smaller and more influential — each designer's work ships to hundreds of thousands of SMBs, providing portfolio impact that larger companies cannot match.

### Agent Mel — The SMB Empowerment Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Mel Interaction Design:** "Designing the user experience for Agent Mel — an AI agent that autonomously manages AP/AR for SMBs — is unlike any other design challenge in fintech. I need to create interaction patterns that build trust in AI-driven financial decisions, handle edge cases gracefully, and empower business owners who aren't tech-savvy. My portfolio includes AI-assisted financial interfaces, and I'm asking for a base of $180K to reflect the specialized nature of this work."

**Lever 2 — $100B+ Processing Design Impact:** "Melio's design directly enabled $100B+ in payment processing by making complex B2B transactions feel simple. Every design decision I make — from payment confirmation flows to error states to the invoice upload experience — impacts transaction completion rates across 500,000+ SMBs. This direct revenue impact justifies a higher options allocation. I'd like $60K annualized to properly reflect the financial leverage of design at Melio's scale."

**Lever 3 — SMB Empowerment User Research Foundation:** "The SMB Empowerment positioning requires deep user research to understand how small business owners actually manage cash flow, pay vendors, and track receivables. I bring a research-driven design practice that has increased task completion rates by 35% in previous financial products. Automating repetitive cash-flow tasks only works if the automation is designed correctly — I'd like a $15K signing bonus to recognize this immediate research-to-design value."

**Lever 4 — Design System Leverage:** "A well-architected design system multiplies engineering velocity across every product surface at Melio, including Agent Mel. I've built and maintained design systems at fintech companies that reduced design-to-development handoff time by 40%. I'd like an annual equity refresh commitment of at least $25K to reflect the platform-level impact of this systems work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $245,000-$275,000 total compensation in New York by pushing base to $175K-$185K, securing options worth $55K-$65K annualized, and negotiating a $15K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $210,000 total comp with a $155K minimum base. In Tel Aviv, target ₪780,000+ total comp. For Remote US, accept no more than a 7% geographic adjustment. Negotiate for: design tool budget ownership, annual equity refreshes, 409A disclosure, and confirmation that the design team reports into product (not engineering) for maximum influence.
