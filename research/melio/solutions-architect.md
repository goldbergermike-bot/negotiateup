**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Melio occupy the critical space between the company's payments platform and its expanding ecosystem of banking partners, accounting software integrations, and enterprise SMB customers. With over $100B in cumulative payment processing and 500,000+ SMBs on the platform, Melio's integration architecture must handle extraordinary diversity — from a sole proprietor using QuickBooks Simple Start to a 200-employee business running Xero with complex multi-entity accounting. Solutions Architects design the integration patterns, API architectures, and partner onboarding frameworks that enable this breadth while maintaining the simplicity that defines Melio's free ACH transfer and B2B payment experience.

The emergence of Agent Mel — Melio's AI agent for automated AP/AR — creates a new architectural dimension for Solutions Architects. Agent Mel must integrate seamlessly with external accounting systems, banking APIs, and vendor networks to autonomously manage payment workflows. Solutions Architects define how Agent Mel accesses, interprets, and acts on data from these external systems while respecting security boundaries and API rate limits. The SMB Empowerment premium means these integration architectures must be robust enough to automate repetitive cash-flow tasks reliably across thousands of different SMB configurations — no two small businesses use Melio's integrations identically.

Melio's private company status (backed by Accel, Bessemer, and Coatue at a peak $4B valuation) means compensation includes options on a 4-year vesting schedule. Solutions Architects, who often have visibility into partner revenue and integration-driven growth metrics, are well positioned to evaluate the equity upside. The $100B+ processing milestone, combined with deepening banking partnerships and the Agent Mel product expansion, suggests significant growth runway that directly ties to the integration work Solutions Architects lead.

### Agent Mel — The SMB Empowerment Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Mel Integration Architecture:** "Agent Mel's ability to automate AP/AR depends on seamless integration with QuickBooks, Xero, banking APIs, and vendor payment networks. I've designed integration architectures for AI-driven financial products that handled similar complexity — multiple data sources, real-time synchronization, and autonomous action across external systems. This Agent Mel integration expertise justifies a base of $205K, up from the offered $180K."

**Lever 2 — $100B+ Processing Partner Ecosystem:** "Melio's $100B+ processing volume flows through a partner ecosystem that I would help architect and maintain. Every banking partner integration, every accounting software connector, and every payment network interface must operate flawlessly at scale for 500,000+ SMBs. I bring direct experience designing partner integration architectures at comparable payment volumes, and I'd like options worth $80K annualized to reflect the revenue-critical nature of this work."

**Lever 3 — SMB Empowerment Integration Simplicity:** "The SMB Empowerment mission means that even the most complex integrations must feel invisible to the small business owner. Automating repetitive cash-flow tasks across QuickBooks, Xero, and bank accounts requires integration patterns that handle edge cases gracefully without surfacing complexity. I've built integration frameworks that reduced SMB setup time from hours to minutes, and I'm requesting a $20K signing bonus for this proven simplification expertise."

**Lever 4 — Banking Partnership Technical Leadership:** "Melio's major bank partnerships require technical leadership that bridges product requirements with partner constraints — API versioning, data privacy, settlement timing, and compliance frameworks. I've led technical partnerships with three of the top 10 US banks and understand the specific requirements for payment integration at this level. I'd like this partnership expertise reflected in a 20% increase to the options grant and guaranteed participation in secondary sales."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $300,000-$335,000 total compensation in New York by anchoring on $200K-$215K base, negotiating $70K-$85K in annualized options, and securing a $20K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $260,000 total comp with a $180K minimum base. In Tel Aviv, target ₪950,000+ total comp. For Remote US, resist discounts beyond 5% — integration architecture is location-independent and partner-facing. Negotiate for: partner-facing travel budget, annual equity refreshes, 409A disclosure, and clarity on the Solutions Architecture team's organizational reporting (product vs. engineering vs. GTM).
