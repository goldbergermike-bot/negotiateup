**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Melio build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers every analytical and operational decision across a platform processing $100B+ in B2B payments. The data estate at Melio is uniquely rich — transaction records, vendor payment patterns, SMB cash-flow cycles, accounting system synchronization logs, and banking partner settlement data for 500,000+ small businesses. Data Engineers design the pipelines, warehouses, and real-time streaming systems that transform this raw data into the analytical foundation that product teams, risk systems, and executive decision-makers depend on. The integrations with QuickBooks, Xero, and banking partners add extract-and-load complexity that requires specialized financial data engineering expertise.

Agent Mel — Melio's AI agent for automated AP/AR — has elevated data engineering from a supporting function to a mission-critical capability. Agent Mel's AI models require clean, timely, and well-structured training and inference data pipelines. Data Engineers build the feature stores, data validation frameworks, and real-time streaming architectures that feed Agent Mel's decision-making engine. When Agent Mel optimizes payment timing, predicts cash-flow shortfalls, or identifies anomalous invoices for SMB owners, the quality of its recommendations is directly bounded by the quality of the data infrastructure. The SMB Empowerment premium for data engineers means that automating repetitive cash-flow tasks at scale requires data pipelines that are not just technically sound but operationally flawless — every data quality issue translates into a bad recommendation for a real small business owner.

As a private company backed by Accel, Bessemer, and Coatue at a peak $4B valuation, Melio offers options on a 4-year vesting schedule. Data Engineers should assess the equity component by evaluating the company's data maturity and the strategic importance of data infrastructure to Melio's growth — the $100B milestone and Agent Mel launch suggest that data engineering investments are accelerating, which bodes well for the equity story.

### Agent Mel — The SMB Empowerment Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Mel Data Pipeline Architecture:** "Agent Mel's AI capabilities are only as good as the data pipelines feeding its models. I would be responsible for building the feature stores, real-time streaming systems, and data validation frameworks that power automated AP/AR for 500,000+ SMBs. I've built production ML data pipelines at comparable scale, and this Agent Mel infrastructure work justifies a base of $190K, up from the offered $165K."

**Lever 2 — $100B+ Processing Data Infrastructure:** "Processing $100B+ in payments generates an extraordinary data estate that requires sophisticated engineering to store, transform, and serve at low latency. I bring experience designing data architectures for high-volume financial systems, including compliance-aware data retention, real-time reconciliation pipelines, and multi-source data integration. This financial data infrastructure expertise is worth $75K annualized in options."

**Lever 3 — SMB Empowerment Analytics Platform:** "The SMB Empowerment vision requires a data platform that enables product teams to rapidly build features that automate repetitive cash-flow tasks. I've designed self-serve analytics platforms that reduced data request turnaround from weeks to hours, directly accelerating feature development for SMB users. I'm requesting a $18K signing bonus for the immediate data platform improvements I'll deliver."

**Lever 4 — Accounting System Data Integration:** "Melio's QuickBooks and Xero integrations generate complex bidirectional data flows that require careful schema mapping, conflict resolution, and data quality monitoring. I have direct experience engineering data pipelines for accounting system integrations and understand the specific challenges of financial data normalization across different accounting platforms. I'd like an additional 15% options grant and annual equity refreshes to reflect this specialized integration data expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $275,000-$308,000 total compensation in New York by pushing base to $185K-$200K, securing options worth $65K-$80K annualized, and negotiating an $18K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $230,000 total comp with a $165K minimum base. In Tel Aviv, target ₪870,000+ total comp. For Remote US, accept no more than a 6% geographic discount — data infrastructure work is location-independent. Negotiate for: data tool and infrastructure budget influence, annual equity refreshes, 409A disclosure, and a clear data engineering career ladder with defined promotion criteria.
