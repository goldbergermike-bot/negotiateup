**Negotiation DNA**

The SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer is Melio's answer to a question that few fintech companies have dared to ask: what happens when you build an engineering role explicitly around the mission of automating every repetitive financial task that drains a small business owner's time? This is not a generic platform engineering position retrofitted with a catchy title — it is a purpose-built role that sits at the intersection of Melio's payments infrastructure ($100B+ in cumulative processing), its AI agent strategy (Agent Mel for automated AP/AR), and its core thesis that 500,000+ SMBs deserve the same sophisticated financial automation that enterprise companies take for granted. The SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer owns the platform layer that makes all of this possible.

At the technical level, this role requires building the abstraction layers, APIs, workflow engines, and developer tools that enable Melio's product teams to rapidly ship SMB empowerment features. Think of it as internal platform engineering with an external mission: every platform capability you build — a new workflow primitive, a data access pattern, an integration connector, an AI orchestration hook — directly translates into a new way that Agent Mel can automate cash-flow tasks for a small business owner who would otherwise spend their evening sorting invoices, chasing late payments, or manually reconciling their books against QuickBooks or Xero. The $100B+ in B2B payments flowing through Melio means this platform must be bulletproof, scalable, and fast.

Melio's positioning as a B2B payments leader backed by Accel, Bessemer, and Coatue at a peak $4B valuation creates a compensation environment that blends growth-stage equity upside with competitive base salaries. As a private company, Melio offers options on a 4-year vesting schedule. The SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer role, because of its strategic centrality to the Agent Mel initiative and the company's broader platform vision, often receives options grants at the higher end of the engineering band — reflecting both the scope of the role and the difficulty of finding engineers who combine platform engineering expertise with deep empathy for SMB users.

This is a role where your work is the company's strategy made concrete. When Melio's leadership talks about SMB Empowerment as the north star, they are describing the platform you build.

**Why This Role Exists Now**

The SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer role emerged from the convergence of three forces at Melio in 2025-2026:

**1. The Agent Mel Imperative.** Agent Mel — Melio's AI agent for automated AP/AR — cannot operate on top of a traditional monolithic payments application. It requires a platform layer that provides composable workflow primitives, event-driven architecture, secure multi-tenant data access, and AI orchestration capabilities. The SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer builds this layer, creating the foundation on which Agent Mel's product capabilities are constructed.

**2. The $100B+ Scale Inflection.** Processing over $100 billion in B2B payments means Melio's architecture must evolve from "startup that works" to "platform that scales." The company needs engineers who think in platform terms — shared services, internal APIs, developer experience, observability frameworks, and reliability patterns that multiply the productivity of every other engineering team. At 500,000+ SMBs, the cost of platform debt compounds rapidly.

**3. The SMB Empowerment Thesis.** Melio's core belief is that small business owners deserve financial automation that was previously available only to enterprises with dedicated finance teams. The SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer translates this thesis into platform capabilities — building the tools that enable product teams to ship features that automate repetitive cash-flow tasks at a pace that matches SMB expectations. Free ACH transfers were the first wave; Agent Mel is the next. The platform engineer ensures there are many more waves after that.

**Role Architecture: What You Actually Build**

Understanding the specific technical domains of the SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer is critical for negotiation — the breadth of this role justifies above-band compensation. Key platform domains include:

**Workflow Engine & Orchestration.** You design and build the workflow engine that powers Agent Mel's automated AP/AR processes. This includes defining workflow primitives (payment scheduling, invoice matching, vendor onboarding), implementing state machines for multi-step financial operations, and creating the orchestration layer that sequences Agent Mel's autonomous actions. Every workflow you build is a new capability that 500,000+ SMBs can access.

**Integration Platform.** Melio's integrations with QuickBooks, Xero, and major banking partners are not one-off connectors — they are a platform. The SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer builds the integration framework that standardizes how external systems connect to Melio, enabling rapid onboarding of new accounting platforms, banking partners, and vendor networks. This platform approach is what allows Agent Mel to operate across diverse SMB tech stacks.

**AI Orchestration Layer.** Agent Mel requires a platform layer that manages AI model inference, prompt routing, tool calling, and human-in-the-loop approval workflows. The SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer builds the infrastructure that allows ML/AI Engineers to deploy new Agent Mel capabilities rapidly and safely, with appropriate guardrails for financial operations.

**Developer Experience & Internal APIs.** Platform engineers at Melio build the internal developer platform that other engineering teams use to ship SMB-facing features. This includes API design standards, SDK generation, documentation systems, and local development environments that reduce the friction of building on top of the Melio platform.

**Observability & Reliability.** At $100B+ processing scale, the platform must provide deep observability into payment workflows, integration health, Agent Mel decision quality, and end-to-end user experience metrics. The SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer defines the observability standards and builds the tooling that keeps the platform reliable.

### Agent Mel — The SMB Empowerment Premium

This role receives the fullest expression of the Agent Mel premium because it is the role most directly responsible for making Agent Mel operational at scale.

**Lever 1 — Agent Mel Platform Ownership:** "The SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer is the role that makes Agent Mel possible at production scale. I would own the workflow engine, AI orchestration layer, and integration platform that Agent Mel depends on to automate AP/AR for 500,000+ SMBs. Without this platform layer, Agent Mel is a demo — with it, Agent Mel is a product that processes real payments and manages real cash flow. This is foundational, company-defining work, and I'm asking for a base of $230K with an options package of $110K annualized to reflect the strategic centrality of this role."

**Lever 2 — $100B+ Processing Platform Scale:** "Melio has processed over $100 billion in B2B payments, and the platform layer I would build must operate reliably at this scale — every workflow execution, every integration sync, every Agent Mel action touches real money for real businesses. I've built platform infrastructure at comparable financial transaction volumes, and I understand the specific reliability, idempotency, and reconciliation patterns required. This $100B+ platform experience justifies top-of-band compensation — I'd like the total package to reflect $370K-$400K in New York."

**Lever 3 — SMB Empowerment Mission Engineering:** "This role exists because Melio believes that automating repetitive cash-flow tasks for small business owners is not just a product feature — it's a platform capability that should be infinitely extensible. I share this conviction and bring platform engineering experience specifically focused on building capabilities that empower non-technical users. Every workflow primitive I build becomes a new way that Agent Mel can serve an SMB owner. I'm requesting a $30K signing bonus to reflect the immediate platform impact I'll deliver and the mission alignment I bring."

**Lever 4 — Founding Role Premium:** "The SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer is a role that Melio is defining for the first time. I would be setting the technical vision, architectural patterns, and platform standards that every subsequent engineer in this function inherits. Founding a platform discipline at a $4B company with 500,000+ SMBs is a career-defining opportunity — but it's also a career-level bet on a private company. I need the equity terms to reflect this: a 10-year post-departure exercise window, double-trigger acceleration on change of control, guaranteed annual equity refreshes of at least $50K annualized, and written participation rights in any secondary sale or tender offer."

**Extended Negotiation Playbook**

Because this is a SIGNATURE ROLE at Melio, candidates should employ an expanded negotiation strategy that goes beyond standard offer negotiations:

**Phase 1 — Pre-Offer Positioning (During Interviews).** Use the interview process to demonstrate platform thinking. When discussing technical architecture, frame your answers in terms of "platform capabilities that enable SMB empowerment." Reference the $100B+ processing milestone and Agent Mel specifically. Ask interviewers about the current state of the platform layer — this signals strategic awareness and positions you as a candidate who understands the role's true scope. Ask how Agent Mel's workflow orchestration is currently architected, what the integration platform's extensibility model looks like, and how the team measures SMB empowerment outcomes at the platform level.

**Phase 2 — Offer Evaluation.** When the offer arrives, evaluate it against three benchmarks simultaneously: (1) platform engineering compensation at public fintech companies (Stripe, Block, Bill.com), (2) AI infrastructure engineering compensation at growth-stage AI companies, and (3) the specific equity upside potential of Melio given the $100B milestone, Agent Mel launch, and $4B peak valuation. The offer should exceed at least two of these three benchmarks to be competitive.

**Phase 3 — Negotiation Execution.** Lead with Lever 1 (Agent Mel Platform Ownership) because it establishes the strategic frame — you are not negotiating for a generic engineering role; you are negotiating for a role that is the operational foundation of Melio's most important product initiative. Follow with Lever 2 ($100B+ Scale) to establish market-rate credibility. Use Lever 3 (SMB Empowerment Mission) to create emotional resonance with the hiring manager. Close with Lever 4 (Founding Role Premium) to secure the equity terms that make a private company bet rational.

**Phase 4 — Post-Acceptance Optimization.** After accepting, negotiate the following within your first 90 days: (1) a platform engineering charter document that defines your domain ownership, (2) headcount commitment for building a platform team beneath you, (3) quarterly business reviews where you present platform metrics to leadership, and (4) a written promotion criteria framework for the SMB Empowerment Platform Engineering career ladder.

**Comparable Role Analysis**

The SMB Empowerment Platform Engineer at Melio maps to several roles at peer companies, but no single role captures the full scope:

| Company | Closest Role | Base | Total Comp | Key Difference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stripe | Platform Engineer (L3) | $195K-$240K | $320K-$430K | Stripe's platform is payments-generic; Melio's is SMB-specific |
| Block | Platform Engineer (Senior) | $185K-$225K | $290K-$380K | Block spans consumer and merchant; Melio is pure SMB B2B |
| Bill.com | Platform Engineer | $170K-$210K | $260K-$340K | Most direct competitor; Bill.com lacks AI agent equivalent to Agent Mel |
| Brex | Platform Engineer | $180K-$230K | $300K-$400K | Brex targets mid-market/enterprise; Melio targets true SMBs |

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $365,000-$400,000 total compensation in New York by anchoring on $225K-$240K base, negotiating $100K-$120K in annualized options, and securing a $30K signing bonus. This is a SIGNATURE ROLE — do not accept below $310,000 total comp with a $195K minimum base. In Tel Aviv, target ₪1,150,000+ total comp (approximately $315K USD), leveraging Israel's platform engineering talent premium. For Remote US, accept absolutely no geographic discount beyond 3% — this is a platform-defining role where impact is entirely location-independent. Non-negotiables for this role: (1) 10-year post-departure exercise window on all options, (2) double-trigger acceleration on change of control, (3) annual equity refresh commitment of at least $50K annualized with written terms, (4) participation rights in any secondary sale or tender offer, (5) 409A valuation disclosure before signing, (6) platform engineering charter defining domain ownership, and (7) headcount commitment for building the SMB Empowerment Platform team. Walk away if the company cannot commit to at least five of these seven terms — this role's strategic importance gives you leverage to demand them.
