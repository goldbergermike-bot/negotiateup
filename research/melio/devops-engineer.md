**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Melio are the guardians of the infrastructure that enables $100B+ in B2B payment processing for 500,000+ small and medium businesses. The platform's reliability is not a nice-to-have — when Melio's infrastructure fails, SMBs cannot pay their vendors, receive payments, or manage their cash flow. This creates a DevOps environment where uptime SLAs carry direct financial consequences, deployment pipelines must support rapid iteration without risking payment integrity, and observability must surface issues before they impact real business transactions. Melio's integrations with QuickBooks, Xero, and major banking partners add additional infrastructure complexity that demands sophisticated CI/CD, secrets management, and multi-environment orchestration.

The rollout of Agent Mel — Melio's AI agent for automated AP/AR — introduces new infrastructure demands that elevate the DevOps role significantly. Agent Mel requires ML model serving infrastructure, real-time event processing pipelines, and the ability to scale AI workloads dynamically based on SMB usage patterns. DevOps Engineers must now support both traditional payment processing systems and AI-native services, bridging two distinct operational paradigms. The SMB Empowerment mission means that infrastructure decisions directly impact whether small business owners can rely on automated cash-flow management — every deployment, scaling event, and infrastructure change touches the daily operations of hundreds of thousands of businesses.

As a private company backed by Accel, Bessemer, and Coatue at a peak $4B valuation, Melio offers options on a 4-year vesting schedule. DevOps Engineers should negotiate for higher base compensation to offset the illiquidity of options, while recognizing that the $100B+ processing scale provides infrastructure experience that commands premium compensation at future roles.

### Agent Mel — The SMB Empowerment Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Mel Infrastructure Enablement:** "Agent Mel requires a fundamentally new infrastructure layer — ML model serving, real-time event pipelines, dynamic scaling for AI workloads. I've built and operated similar AI-serving infrastructure in production, and I can accelerate Melio's Agent Mel deployment timeline by establishing the DevOps foundations early. This specialized AI infrastructure expertise justifies a base of $185K, up from the initial offer of $160K."

**Lever 2 — $100B+ Processing Reliability:** "Supporting $100B+ in payment processing means that infrastructure reliability at Melio has direct financial consequences. Every minute of downtime affects 500,000+ SMBs and their cash flow. I bring a track record of maintaining 99.99% uptime for high-volume financial systems and implementing disaster recovery architectures that meet financial regulatory standards. This reliability experience is worth a premium — I'd like $65K annualized in options."

**Lever 3 — SMB Empowerment Through Operational Excellence:** "The SMB Empowerment vision depends on Melio's platform being available, fast, and reliable every time a small business owner needs to automate a repetitive cash-flow task. My approach to DevOps — proactive observability, progressive delivery, and chaos engineering — ensures that infrastructure supports the SMB experience rather than undermining it. I'm requesting a $15K signing bonus for the immediate operational improvements I'll deliver."

**Lever 4 — Multi-Cloud and Banking Integration Complexity:** "Melio's partnerships with major banks and integrations with accounting platforms require navigating complex networking, compliance, and data residency requirements. I have direct experience with financial services cloud infrastructure, including PCI-DSS compliance automation and bank API integration patterns. I'd like this specialized compliance infrastructure expertise reflected in an additional 15% options grant."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $260,000-$290,000 total compensation in New York by pushing base to $180K-$195K, securing options worth $60K-$70K annualized, and negotiating a $15K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $220,000 total comp with a $160K minimum base. In Tel Aviv, target ₪830,000+ total comp. For Remote US, resist geographic discounts beyond 5% — infrastructure is location-independent. Negotiate for: on-call compensation or reduced on-call rotation commitments, annual equity refreshes, cloud certification budget, and 409A valuation disclosure.
