**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Melio are building the intelligence layer that transforms a successful payments platform into an autonomous financial operating system for small businesses. With $100B+ in cumulative B2B payment processing and 500,000+ SMBs generating rich behavioral data — payment patterns, cash-flow cycles, vendor relationships, seasonal trends — the ML/AI engineering opportunity at Melio is exceptional. Unlike companies where AI is a feature add-on, Melio is positioning AI as the core product differentiator through Agent Mel, making this role central to the company's competitive strategy against Bill.com, Stripe, and Block.

Agent Mel — Melio's AI agent for automated AP/AR — is the primary work domain for ML/AI Engineers. This agent must understand natural language invoice descriptions, predict optimal payment timing based on cash-flow patterns, detect fraudulent or anomalous transactions, recommend vendor payment strategies, and autonomously execute payment workflows with appropriate guardrails. ML/AI Engineers build the models, fine-tune the LLMs, design the agent orchestration frameworks, and implement the reinforcement learning systems that make Agent Mel progressively smarter across 500,000+ SMB accounts. The SMB Empowerment premium means these AI systems must be accurate, explainable, and trustworthy enough for non-technical small business owners to delegate their most critical financial operations — automating repetitive cash-flow tasks is only valuable if the automation consistently gets it right.

The ML/AI Engineer role at Melio carries premium compensation even by fintech standards. As a private company backed by Accel, Bessemer, and Coatue at a peak $4B valuation, Melio offers options on a 4-year vesting schedule. The intense competition for AI talent — from both public tech giants and well-funded AI startups — gives ML/AI Engineers significant negotiating leverage. Candidates should benchmark against both fintech peers and AI-focused companies, recognizing that Melio offers a rare combination of production-scale financial data and a greenfield AI agent development opportunity.

### Agent Mel — The SMB Empowerment Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Mel Core Model Development:** "I would be building the core AI models that power Agent Mel — invoice understanding, payment timing optimization, cash-flow prediction, and anomaly detection for 500,000+ SMBs. This is a production AI agent that autonomously manages financial operations, not a research prototype. I've shipped comparable AI systems to production at scale, and this core Agent Mel development role justifies a base of $220K, up from the offered $190K."

**Lever 2 — $100B+ Processing AI Leverage:** "Melio's $100B+ in processed payments generates one of the richest B2B financial datasets available for ML model training. I can leverage this data to build models with accuracy and robustness that competitors with smaller datasets cannot match. My experience training financial ML models on large-scale transaction data directly accelerates Agent Mel's time-to-production. I'd like options worth $100K annualized to reflect the unique data advantage I can exploit."

**Lever 3 — SMB Empowerment AI Trust:** "The SMB Empowerment mission requires AI systems that small business owners trust with their money. Automating repetitive cash-flow tasks through Agent Mel means building explainable AI — business owners need to understand why a payment was scheduled, why an invoice was flagged, why a cash-flow warning was triggered. I've built explainable AI systems for financial products and understand the specific trust requirements. I'm requesting a $25K signing bonus for this AI trust engineering expertise."

**Lever 4 — AI Talent Market Premium:** "The market for production AI/ML engineers with fintech experience is extremely competitive. I'm evaluating opportunities at both public tech companies offering $400K+ total comp in liquid RSUs and AI startups with aggressive equity packages. I'm genuinely excited about Agent Mel — the combination of $100B+ in real payment data and a greenfield AI agent development opportunity is rare. But the compensation must reflect the market reality for AI talent. I need the total package to exceed $350K, with options structured to include a 10-year exercise window and acceleration provisions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $340,000-$375,000 total compensation in New York by anchoring on $215K-$230K base, negotiating $90K-$110K in annualized options, and securing a $25K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $290,000 total comp with a $190K minimum base. In Tel Aviv, target ₪1,050,000+ total comp (Israel's AI talent commands top-tier global compensation). For Remote US, resist any geographic discount beyond 3% — AI talent is the scarcest resource and location-independent. Non-negotiables: 10-year exercise window, double-trigger acceleration, annual equity refreshes with a $40K minimum, GPU/compute budget for experimentation, and 409A valuation disclosure.
