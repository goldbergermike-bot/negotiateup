**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Melio operate at the intersection of technical execution and organizational scaling. Managing teams that build and maintain the payment processing infrastructure serving 500,000+ SMBs, you are responsible for both the velocity and reliability of a platform that has processed over $100B in B2B payments. Melio's dual-hub structure — with engineering teams in both New York and Tel Aviv — means EMs must navigate cross-timezone collaboration, cultural differences, and distributed delivery models while maintaining the quality bar required for financial infrastructure.

The 2026 rollout of Agent Mel — Melio's AI agent for automated AP/AR — creates a step-function increase in the complexity of engineering management at the company. EMs are now responsible for staffing and leading teams that blend traditional payments engineering with AI/ML capabilities, requiring a new playbook for hiring, skill development, and technical mentorship. The SMB Empowerment mission adds a customer-obsession dimension: every sprint planning session must weigh the impact of engineering decisions on the small business owners who rely on Melio to automate repetitive cash-flow tasks and simplify B2B payments.

As a private company backed by Accel, Bessemer, and Coatue at a peak $4B valuation, Melio offers options on a 4-year vesting schedule. Engineering Managers should evaluate whether the company's IPO timeline aligns with their personal financial planning. The $100B+ processing milestone and Agent Mel product expansion suggest strong business momentum, but the options grant size and strike price must be scrutinized against what public competitors (Google, Meta, Block) offer in immediately liquid RSUs. Negotiate for transparency on the cap table, the latest 409A valuation, and the total shares outstanding to properly value your equity.

### Agent Mel — The SMB Empowerment Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Mel Team Building:** "Leading the Agent Mel engineering initiative means building a team from the ground up — hiring AI/ML engineers, payments specialists, and full-stack developers who can collaborate on an entirely new product category. I've scaled engineering teams through similar 0-to-1 product launches, and I know the hiring playbook for blending AI talent with domain experts. This team-building mandate justifies a base of $230K and an options package of $100K annualized."

**Lever 2 — $100B+ Processing Delivery Accountability:** "Managing teams responsible for $100B+ in payment processing volume means that every deployment, every incident response, and every architectural decision I oversee has direct financial implications for Melio and its 500,000+ SMB customers. The delivery accountability at this scale is comparable to what engineering managers handle at public fintech companies paying $350K-$400K total comp. I'd like Melio's offer to reflect competitive positioning."

**Lever 3 — SMB Empowerment Cross-Functional Leadership:** "The SMB Empowerment vision requires tight collaboration between engineering, product, and design to ensure that automating repetitive cash-flow tasks actually translates into a seamless experience for small business owners. I bring experience leading cross-functional pods that ship customer-facing financial products, and I'd like a $25K signing bonus to reflect the immediate organizational impact I'll drive."

**Lever 4 — Dual-Hub Management Premium:** "Managing distributed teams across New York and Tel Aviv adds meaningful complexity — different time zones, labor regulations, and engineering cultures. I have experience leading teams across similar configurations and can maintain velocity without burning out either hub. I'd like this cross-geography management complexity reflected in a 10% bump to the options grant and a commitment to annual equity refreshes."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target $350,000-$390,000 total compensation in New York by pushing base to $225K-$240K, securing options worth $90K-$110K annualized, and negotiating a $20K-$25K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $300,000 total comp with a $205K minimum base. In Tel Aviv, target ₪1,100,000+ total comp. For Remote US, accept no more than a 5% geographic adjustment. Negotiate for: annual equity refreshes with a minimum $40K annualized floor, 409A valuation disclosure, participation in secondary offerings, and a written management scope commitment (team size, direct reports, budget authority).
