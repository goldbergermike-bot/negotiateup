**Negotiation DNA**

Melio has established itself as the dominant B2B payments platform for small and medium businesses, processing over $100B in cumulative transactions and serving more than 500,000 SMBs across the United States. As a Software Engineer at Melio, you sit at the foundation of a platform that is fundamentally transforming how small businesses manage accounts payable and accounts receivable. The company's free ACH transfers, QuickBooks and Xero integrations, and partnerships with major banks create a product ecosystem that demands engineering talent capable of building reliable, scalable financial infrastructure.

The 2026 launch of Agent Mel — Melio's AI-powered agent for automated AP/AR — represents a paradigm shift in the company's technical ambitions. Software Engineers are now expected to contribute to systems that go beyond traditional payment processing into intelligent workflow automation. The SMB Empowerment premium means that every engineer's work directly impacts whether a small business owner spends their evening reconciling invoices or growing their business. This mission-driven positioning, combined with Melio's peak $4B valuation backed by Accel, Bessemer, and Coatue, gives candidates meaningful leverage when negotiating compensation packages at this level.

As a private company, Melio compensates with stock options on a 4-year vesting schedule rather than RSUs. This creates both risk and upside — candidates should evaluate the current 409A valuation, the company's trajectory toward a potential IPO or secondary sale, and the strike price relative to the last preferred price. The processing milestone of $100B+ signals product-market fit that de-risks the equity component meaningfully.

### Agent Mel — The SMB Empowerment Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Mel Infrastructure Contribution:** "I'm excited about building the foundational services that power Agent Mel. My experience with event-driven architectures and API design maps directly to the automated AP/AR workflows that Agent Mel needs to operate reliably for 500,000+ SMBs. I'd like the base compensation to reflect the AI-adjacent infrastructure complexity this role demands — specifically, moving from $130K to $148K base."

**Lever 2 — $100B Processing Scale:** "Melio has processed over $100 billion in payments, and at that scale, every software decision carries financial risk. I bring production experience with high-availability payment systems, which directly reduces the engineering risk associated with processing at this volume. I believe this justifies an additional options grant of $15K annualized to reflect the trust placed in engineers operating at this scale."

**Lever 3 — SMB Empowerment Mission Alignment:** "The SMB Empowerment mission resonates deeply with me — I've seen firsthand how automating repetitive cash-flow tasks transforms small business operations. My background in building user-facing financial tools means I can ship features that directly reduce the manual AP/AR burden for SMB owners. I'd like to discuss a signing bonus of $15,000 to bridge the gap between my current compensation and Melio's offer."

**Lever 4 — Private Company Equity Upside:** "Given Melio's trajectory — $4B peak valuation, $100B+ processing, and the Agent Mel product expansion — the equity upside here is substantial. However, as a private company, liquidity is uncertain. I'd appreciate either a 15% increase in the options grant to compensate for the liquidity discount, or a commitment to participate in any future secondary sale or tender offer program."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a total compensation package of $210,000-$240,000 in New York by anchoring on a $155K base (up from initial $130K-$140K offers), requesting an additional 20% options grant citing Agent Mel complexity, and securing a $15K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $185,000 total comp with a minimum base of $140K. In Tel Aviv, target ₪700,000+ total comp. For Remote US, apply a 5-8% geographic discount but hold firm on equity. Always negotiate the strike price disclosure and 409A valuation transparency before signing.
