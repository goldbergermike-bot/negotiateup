### Lossless Ethernet AI Platform Engineer | Arista Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI Networking & Cloud Infrastructure | 800G R4 Lossless Ethernet | Year 1 Equity Density | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+25–35% AI NETWORKING PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $242K–$302K | $342K–$602K | 15–20% | $378K–$535K |
| Vancouver (BC) | C$228K–C$285K | C$322K–C$568K | 15–20% | C$358K–C$508K |
| Remote US | $235K–$295K | $342K–$602K | 15–20% | $372K–$528K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Arista's signature role for 2026 — the Lossless Ethernet AI Platform Engineer. You build the full-stack networking platform that is displacing NVIDIA InfiniBand as the fabric for AI data centers — the lossless Ethernet protocols, RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) implementation, adaptive routing algorithms, congestion control systems, and the AI-aware traffic engineering that enables GPU-to-GPU communication at wire speed with zero packet loss over standard Ethernet. This is the most consequential networking engineering in a decade: every hyperscaler's decision to deploy Arista Ethernet instead of InfiniBand depends on your platform delivering equivalent or superior performance at lower cost. The 25-35% AI Networking Premium reflects the extreme rarity of engineers who can build lossless networking for AI workloads — the intersection of high-performance networking, AI infrastructure, and distributed systems.

**Level Mapping:** Arista Lossless Ethernet Platform Eng (IC3-IC4) = NVIDIA InfiniBand Eng = Cisco AI Networking Eng = Juniper Mist Platform Eng = Google AI Network Eng = No true peer — Arista owns the Ethernet-for-AI market

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Lossless Ethernet AI Platform Engineer works at the intersection of high-performance networking, AI infrastructure, and distributed systems:
- **Lossless Ethernet Protocols:** The protocol stack that delivers zero packet loss at 800G — Priority Flow Control, Explicit Congestion Notification, and Arista's proprietary lossless extensions that match InfiniBand reliability
- **RoCE Implementation:** RDMA over Converged Ethernet enabling GPU-to-GPU memory access over standard Ethernet — the technology that makes Ethernet viable for AI training
- **Adaptive Routing for AI:** ML-driven adaptive routing that dynamically optimizes traffic paths based on AI training communication patterns — the intelligence layer that gives Ethernet its performance edge
- **Congestion Control at 800G:** Advanced congestion control algorithms that prevent performance degradation in massive AI training clusters — maintaining wire-speed performance across thousands of GPU connections
- **AI-Aware Traffic Engineering:** Networking intelligence that understands AI training workload communication patterns and optimizes the network fabric accordingly — the killer feature that InfiniBand can't match

**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

As the Lossless Ethernet AI Platform Engineer — Arista's signature role — you are the engineer winning the InfiniBand displacement war. Every hyperscaler evaluation, every customer POC, every benchmark comparison depends on your platform delivering lossless performance that matches or beats InfiniBand. Arista's stock is appreciating massively during this transition, making front-loaded RSUs the most valuable comp component. "As the Lossless Ethernet Platform Engineer — Arista's signature role — I build the platform that is displacing InfiniBand as the fabric for AI data centers. I want $595K+ RSUs with maximum Year 1 equity density and the 25-35% AI Networking Premium. Every hyperscaler that switches from InfiniBand to Arista Ethernet depends on my platform. The script: 'I am the engineer displacing InfiniBand. My lossless Ethernet platform determines whether the world's AI training clusters run on Arista or NVIDIA networking. This is a winner-take-all market — and I'm building the winner. I want $595K+ RSUs with maximum Year 1 front-loading because Arista's stock trajectory during the InfiniBand displacement means Year 1 equity is the most valuable compensation in the industry. Fewer than 200 engineers globally can build lossless Ethernet platforms for AI at this level — and none of them are available for standard networking comp.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Maximum Year 1 Equity Density + AI Networking Premium:** "I displace InfiniBand with lossless Ethernet. $595K+ RSUs with maximum Year 1 front-loading and the 25-35% AI Networking Premium — Arista's stock appreciation during the transition makes Year 1 equity the highest-value comp in networking."
2. **InfiniBand Displacement — Winner-Take-All:** "This is a winner-take-all market for AI data center networking. My platform determines whether Arista wins. Every hyperscaler evaluation depends on my lossless performance matching InfiniBand. There is no more consequential networking engineering."
3. **200-Person Global Talent Pool:** "Fewer than 200 engineers globally can build lossless Ethernet platforms for AI workloads — the intersection of high-performance networking, RoCE, and AI infrastructure. This extreme scarcity justifies compensation that ignores standard networking bands."
4. **NVIDIA InfiniBand Eng Parity:** "NVIDIA InfiniBand engineers earn $480K+ TC. I build the technology displacing their product. Arista must pay at or above InfiniBand engineering comp to attract the talent that wins the displacement war."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $298K base and $595K RSUs over 4 years with maximum Year 1 equity density and the 25-35% AI Networking Premium for this Lossless Ethernet AI Platform Engineer role — Arista's signature position. I build the platform displacing InfiniBand as the fabric for AI data centers — every hyperscaler evaluation depends on my lossless Ethernet matching InfiniBand performance. I have competing offers from [NVIDIA InfiniBand at $485K TC / Google AI Networking at $475K TC / Cisco AI at $458K TC]. I am the engineer winning the InfiniBand war. Fewer than 200 people can do this job — and Arista's stock trajectory makes Year 1 equity density the most valuable comp structure in networking." Accept at $275K+ base and $535K+ RSUs.
