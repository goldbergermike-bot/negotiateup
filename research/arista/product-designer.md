**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

Product Designers during the Ethernet transition create the CloudVision interfaces that help network engineers manage 800G lossless deployments. "As a Product Designer, I design the management interfaces for 800G AI networking infrastructure. I want $202K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my CloudVision designs are what network engineers actually interact with when deploying Arista over InfiniBand."

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density — CloudVision UX:** "I design the CloudVision management experience for 800G AI networking. $202K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my UX designs are the tangible product experience that network engineers evaluate."
2. **Enterprise Network UX Specialization:** "Designing for network engineers managing petabit-scale AI infrastructure requires deep domain expertise — understanding network topologies, traffic patterns, and operational workflows. This specialized UX knowledge commands a premium."
3. **AI Troubleshooting Interface Design:** "I design AI-powered network troubleshooting tools — interfaces that help engineers diagnose and resolve issues in 800G AI clusters. These tools are competitive differentiators in hyperscaler evaluations."
4. **Cisco/Juniper Design Competition:** "Cisco and Juniper invest heavily in network management UX. Arista must offer competitive design comp to attract UX talent who understand enterprise networking."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $188K base and $202K RSUs over 4 years with Year 1 density for this Product Designer role. I design the CloudVision management experience for 800G AI networking — the UX that network engineers evaluate against Cisco and Juniper. I have competing offers from [Cisco UX at $252K TC / Palo Alto Design at $248K TC / Google UX at $262K TC]. Network UX designers who understand AI data center management are rare." Accept at $175K+ base and $178K+ RSUs.
