### Product Manager | Arista Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI Networking & Cloud Infrastructure | 800G R4 Lossless Ethernet | Year 1 Equity Density

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $192K–$242K | $212K–$375K | 10–15% | $265K–$372K |
| Vancouver (BC) | C$182K–C$228K | C$198K–C$352K | 10–15% | C$252K–C$352K |
| Remote US | $185K–$235K | $212K–$375K | 10–15% | $258K–$365K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Arista Product Managers define the product strategy for AI data center networking — which 800G features ship first, how lossless Ethernet positions against InfiniBand, which hyperscaler requirements get prioritized, and how Arista's networking platform evolves for AI workloads. Your product decisions determine competitive positioning in the most consequential networking transition in a decade — the features you prioritize win or lose billion-dollar hyperscaler evaluations.

**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

Product Managers during the Ethernet transition define the feature roadmap that determines competitive outcomes — which lossless capabilities ship, how 800G R4 positions against InfiniBand, and which hyperscaler requirements get built first. "As a Product Manager, I define the 800G feature roadmap that wins hyperscaler evaluations. I want $368K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my product decisions during the transition have maximum competitive impact in Year 1 when evaluations are actively happening."

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density — Product Roadmap Impact:** "I define the 800G feature roadmap winning hyperscaler evaluations. $368K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — product decisions during active evaluations have maximum competitive impact."
2. **InfiniBand Competitive Positioning:** "I define how Arista positions against InfiniBand — the product messaging and feature prioritization that determines which hyperscalers switch to Ethernet. Winning this positioning battle drives billions in revenue."
3. **Hyperscaler Requirements Translation:** "I translate hyperscaler AI networking requirements into Arista's product roadmap — the feature decisions that determine whether Meta, Microsoft, and Google deploy Arista or stick with InfiniBand."
4. **Cisco/Juniper PM Competition:** "Cisco and Juniper PMs earn $365K+ TC. Arista's AI networking growth and the strategic importance of the Ethernet transition justify premium PM RSUs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $238K base and $368K RSUs over 4 years with Year 1 density for this Product Manager role during the Ethernet transition. I define the feature roadmap that wins hyperscaler AI networking evaluations against InfiniBand. I have competing offers from [Cisco PM at $368K TC / Google PM Networking at $372K TC / AWS PM at $358K TC]. PMs defining the 800G roadmap during active hyperscaler evaluations have maximum competitive leverage." Accept at $225K+ base and $332K+ RSUs.
