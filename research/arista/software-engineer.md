**Negotiation DNA**

Arista Software Engineers build the network operating system (EOS) and cloud networking software that powers the world's largest AI data centers — the Ethernet fabric that connects GPU clusters for AI training at Meta, Microsoft, Google, and every major hyperscaler. Your software determines whether AI training clusters can communicate at wire speed with zero packet loss — the network performance that makes or breaks billion-dollar AI infrastructure investments. The 800G R4 series and the industry shift from InfiniBand to Lossless Ethernet means Arista is winning the AI networking war, and your software is the weapon. [Source: Arista SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

The industry is shifting from NVIDIA InfiniBand to Lossless Ethernet for AI data center networking — and Arista's 800G R4 series is the product that wins this transition. This is the most consequential networking architecture shift in a decade: every new AI training cluster being built today evaluates Arista Ethernet vs. NVIDIA InfiniBand. Arista's stock has massively outperformed during this transition, making RSU grants extremely valuable. "As a Software Engineer joining during the InfiniBand-to-Ethernet transition, I want maximum Year 1 equity density. Arista's 800G R4 is winning the AI networking war — every hyperscaler is evaluating or deploying Lossless Ethernet. I want my RSU grant front-loaded to maximize Year 1 vesting, because Arista's stock trajectory during this transition means Year 1 equity is the most valuable comp component. The script: 'I'm joining at the inflection point where Ethernet replaces InfiniBand for AI networking. Arista is the winner. I want $315K+ in RSUs with maximum Year 1 density — front-loaded vesting that captures the stock appreciation during this once-in-a-decade networking transition.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density — Front-Loaded RSUs:** "Arista's stock is appreciating as Ethernet wins over InfiniBand. I want maximum Year 1 equity density — $315K+ RSUs with front-loaded vesting that captures the AI networking transition appreciation."
2. **800G R4 Ethernet Dominance:** "The 800G R4 series is winning against InfiniBand in every major AI data center evaluation. I build the software that delivers lossless performance at 800G — the product winning the most consequential networking transition in a decade."
3. **AI Data Center Networking Moat:** "Every major AI training cluster needs Arista Ethernet — Meta, Microsoft, Google, Amazon. My EOS software is the moat that keeps hyperscalers on Arista. Network switching revenue from AI is growing 40%+ YoY."
4. **Cisco/Juniper Competitive Talent:** "Arista competes with Cisco and Juniper for networking software talent. Arista's stock performance and AI networking growth justify top-of-market RSU grants to attract engineers from larger but slower-growing competitors."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and $315K RSUs over 4 years with maximum Year 1 equity density for this Software Engineer role during the InfiniBand-to-Ethernet transition. Arista's 800G R4 is winning the AI networking war — I build the EOS software that delivers lossless performance at wire speed. I have competing offers from [Cisco at $318K TC / Google Networking at $335K TC / Juniper at $308K TC]. Arista's stock trajectory during the Ethernet transition means front-loaded RSUs are the highest-value comp structure." Accept at $205K+ base and $282K+ RSUs.
