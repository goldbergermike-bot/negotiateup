### Technical Program Manager | Arista Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | AI Networking & Cloud Infrastructure | 800G R4 Lossless Ethernet | Year 1 Equity Density

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Santa Clara | $185K–$232K | $168K–$298K | 10–15% | $238K–$332K |
| Vancouver (BC) | C$175K–C$218K | C$158K–C$278K | 10–15% | C$225K–C$312K |
| Remote US | $178K–$225K | $168K–$298K | 10–15% | $232K–$328K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Arista TPMs coordinate the cross-functional programs delivering 800G lossless Ethernet to market — silicon-software integration, customer qualification, EOS release timelines, and the competitive feature delivery that determines whether Arista wins the InfiniBand displacement. Your program management velocity directly determines Arista's competitive timing against Cisco, Juniper, and InfiniBand alternatives. [Source: Arista TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Arista TPM (TPM2-TPM3) = Cisco TPM = Juniper TPM = Google L5 TPM = AWS TPM

**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

TPMs during the Ethernet transition coordinate the 800G R4 delivery programs — synchronizing silicon, software, testing, and customer qualification on aggressive competitive timelines. "As a TPM, I coordinate 800G delivery across silicon, software, and customer teams. I want $292K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my coordination velocity during the InfiniBand displacement determines whether Arista wins the competitive timing war."

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density — Delivery Coordination:** "I coordinate 800G delivery programs. $292K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my program velocity during the InfiniBand displacement determines competitive timing."
2. **Competitive Timing Management:** "Every day of 800G feature delivery I accelerate is competitive advantage gained over InfiniBand. My program management velocity directly converts to market share."
3. **Silicon-Software-Customer Synchronization:** "I synchronize the three-way coordination between switching silicon, EOS software, and customer qualification — the program complexity that determines Arista's execution cadence."
4. **Hyperscaler Qualification Programs:** "I manage customer qualification timelines for the world's largest AI network deployments. Faster qualification means faster revenue — my program velocity directly converts to revenue timing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $228K base and $292K RSUs over 4 years with Year 1 density for this TPM role during the Ethernet transition. I coordinate 800G delivery across silicon, software, and customer teams. I have competing offers from [Cisco TPM at $328K TC / Google TPM at $348K TC / Juniper TPM at $318K TC]. TPMs coordinating 800G delivery during the InfiniBand displacement are Arista's execution bottleneck." Accept at $215K+ base and $262K+ RSUs.
