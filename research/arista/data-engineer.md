**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

Data Engineers during the Ethernet transition build the telemetry and benchmarking infrastructure that measures 800G lossless performance — the data that proves Arista beats InfiniBand and informs product decisions. "As a Data Engineer, I build the data infrastructure measuring 800G performance. I want $282K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my telemetry pipelines produce the evidence that Arista wins the networking transition."

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density — Telemetry Infrastructure:** "I build the data infrastructure measuring 800G performance. $282K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my telemetry pipelines produce the competitive evidence for the Ethernet transition."
2. **CloudVision Analytics Platform:** "I engineer the CloudVision data platform — processing network telemetry from thousands of deployments. This platform drives product intelligence, customer success, and competitive analysis."
3. **Performance Benchmark Data:** "I build the benchmark infrastructure that measures Arista's 800G performance against InfiniBand — the data that proves Arista's technical advantage and wins customer evaluations."
4. **Network Intelligence at Scale:** "I process telemetry from the world's largest AI networking deployments — performance patterns, traffic analytics, and operational insights that inform product strategy and customer success."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $282K RSUs over 4 years with Year 1 density for this Data Engineer role. I build the CloudVision data infrastructure measuring 800G performance against InfiniBand. I have competing offers from [Cisco DE at $318K TC / Google DE at $338K TC / Palo Alto DE at $312K TC]. Data engineers building network telemetry at scale during competitive transitions are specialized analytical infrastructure talent." Accept at $208K+ base and $252K+ RSUs.
