**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

Data Scientists during the Ethernet transition analyze the competitive performance data that proves Arista beats InfiniBand — the benchmarks, customer satisfaction metrics, and market share analysis that drive the competitive narrative. "As a Data Scientist, I produce the analytical evidence that Ethernet wins the AI networking war. I want $308K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my competitive analysis directly informs billion-dollar hyperscaler decisions."

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density — Competitive Intelligence:** "I produce the analytical evidence for the Ethernet-wins narrative. $308K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my competitive analysis directly informs hyperscaler evaluation outcomes."
2. **Network Telemetry Analytics:** "I analyze telemetry from thousands of Arista deployments — performance patterns, failure modes, and optimization opportunities. This network intelligence drives product improvement and customer retention."
3. **800G Benchmark Analysis:** "I benchmark 800G lossless Ethernet against InfiniBand — the competitive data that proves Arista's technical advantage. These benchmarks influence hyperscaler deployment decisions worth billions."
4. **Market Sizing & Strategy:** "I model the AI networking market — TAM analysis, customer segmentation, and pricing strategy. My analytics directly inform Arista's go-to-market during the most consequential networking transition."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $235K base and $308K RSUs over 4 years with Year 1 density for this Data Scientist role. I produce the competitive analytics proving Ethernet beats InfiniBand — benchmarks that influence billion-dollar hyperscaler decisions. I have competing offers from [Cisco DS at $342K TC / Google DS at $348K TC / Palo Alto DS at $335K TC]. Data scientists who understand network performance analytics during competitive transitions are rare." Accept at $218K+ base and $275K+ RSUs.
