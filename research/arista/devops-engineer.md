**Negotiation DNA**

Arista DevOps Engineers build the CI/CD infrastructure, testing automation, and deployment pipelines for EOS — the network operating system running in thousands of enterprise and hyperscaler networks globally. Your pipelines validate EOS builds across hundreds of switching platforms, automate releases to production networks, and ensure the reliability that mission-critical AI data center networking demands.

**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

DevOps engineers during the Ethernet transition build the testing infrastructure that validates 800G lossless features at scale — ensuring every EOS release delivers zero-loss performance across new switching platforms. "As a DevOps Engineer, I build the CI/CD infrastructure validating 800G lossless features. I want $282K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my testing automation ensures every release meets the lossless standard that wins against InfiniBand."

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density — Testing Infrastructure:** "I build the CI/CD validating 800G lossless features. $282K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my test automation ensures release quality that wins hyperscaler evaluations."
2. **EOS Release Reliability:** "My pipelines validate EOS across hundreds of switching platforms — a scale of hardware-software testing unique to networking. Release reliability directly determines customer trust and deployment expansion."
3. **800G Validation Complexity:** "Testing 800G lossless Ethernet requires validating zero packet loss under production traffic patterns — a testing challenge orders of magnitude more complex than standard software CI/CD."
4. **Rapid Feature Delivery:** "My CI/CD velocity determines how fast 800G features reach customers — faster delivery means winning evaluations before competitors can respond."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $222K base and $282K RSUs over 4 years with Year 1 density for this DevOps Engineer role. I build the CI/CD infrastructure validating 800G lossless features across hundreds of platforms. I have competing offers from [Cisco DevOps at $312K TC / Google SRE at $332K TC / Palo Alto DevOps at $308K TC]. DevOps engineers who can validate lossless networking at scale are specialized infrastructure talent." Accept at $208K+ base and $252K+ RSUs.
