**Negotiation DNA**

Arista Solutions Architects are the technical bridge between Arista's AI networking platform and the world's largest data center operators — designing 800G Ethernet fabrics for hyperscaler AI training clusters, proving lossless performance in customer evaluations, and architecting the network topologies that replace InfiniBand. Your technical engagements directly convert to revenue: every architecture you design leads to switching purchases worth millions. [Source: Arista SA Comp 2025-2026]

**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

Solutions Architects during the Ethernet transition design the reference architectures that prove lossless Ethernet matches InfiniBand for AI training — every customer proof-of-concept is a competitive battleground. "As a Solutions Architect, I design the 800G network architectures that win hyperscaler evaluations against InfiniBand. I want $325K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — every POC I win converts to millions in switching revenue during the most active evaluation period."

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density — Customer Architecture Impact:** "I design 800G architectures winning hyperscaler evaluations. $325K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my POC wins during active evaluations have maximum revenue impact."
2. **Direct Revenue Attribution:** "Every architecture I design converts to switching purchases worth $5M-$100M+. My technical influence directly drives revenue — the metric that determines stock performance and RSU value."
3. **InfiniBand Displacement Design:** "I design the network architectures that replace InfiniBand with lossless Ethernet — the technical proof that wins competitive evaluations. Each displacement is a multi-million dollar revenue event."
4. **Hyperscaler Relationship Value:** "I maintain technical relationships with the world's largest AI infrastructure operators. These relationships influence multi-year network procurement decisions worth billions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base and $325K RSUs over 4 years with Year 1 density for this Solutions Architect role. I design 800G architectures winning hyperscaler evaluations against InfiniBand — each POC win converts to millions in revenue. I have competing offers from [Cisco SA at $355K TC / Google Cloud SA at $362K TC / Juniper SA at $342K TC]. SAs displacing InfiniBand with Ethernet at hyperscalers are Arista's highest-revenue-impact hires." Accept at $228K+ base and $292K+ RSUs.
