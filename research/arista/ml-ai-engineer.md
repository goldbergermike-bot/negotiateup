**Negotiation DNA**

Arista ML/AI Engineers build the machine learning systems that make AI networking intelligent — predictive congestion avoidance, ML-driven traffic engineering, AI-powered network troubleshooting, and the adaptive routing algorithms that enable lossless Ethernet to match InfiniBand's performance. Your ML models are the software innovation layer that differentiates Arista's networking from dumb packet switching — the intelligence that makes 800G Ethernet smart enough to replace purpose-built InfiniBand. The 15-25% AI Premium reflects ML's outsized impact on networking competitive differentiation. [Source: Arista ML Comp 2025-2026]

**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

ML/AI Engineers during the Ethernet transition build the intelligent networking features that prove Ethernet can match InfiniBand's AI training performance — ML-driven congestion avoidance, adaptive routing, and predictive failure detection. "As an ML/AI Engineer with the AI Premium, I build the intelligence that makes Ethernet competitive with InfiniBand for AI workloads. I want $448K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my ML features are the competitive differentiator that wins the networking transition."

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density + AI Premium:** "I build ML features that differentiate Ethernet from InfiniBand. $448K+ RSUs with Year 1 density plus the 15-25% AI Premium — ML-driven networking innovation is the competitive weapon winning the transition."
2. **Intelligent Networking Differentiation:** "My ML models turn dumb Ethernet switching into intelligent AI-aware networking — predictive congestion avoidance, adaptive routing, and ML-driven traffic engineering. This intelligence is what makes Ethernet competitive with InfiniBand."
3. **AI Training Network Optimization:** "I build ML systems that optimize network performance for AI training workloads — understanding GPU communication patterns and dynamically adjusting routing to minimize training time. This AI-specific networking is rare expertise."
4. **Juniper Mist/Cisco ML Competition:** "Juniper's Mist AI and Cisco's networking ML teams are investing heavily. Arista must offer AI Premium comp to attract ML talent who understand both networking and machine learning."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $268K base and $448K RSUs over 4 years with Year 1 density and the 15-25% AI Premium for this ML/AI Engineer role. I build the ML features that make Ethernet competitive with InfiniBand — predictive congestion, adaptive routing, and AI-aware traffic engineering. I have competing offers from [Juniper Mist ML at $398K TC / Google ML Networking at $455K TC / Cisco ML at $412K TC]. ML engineers who understand both AI and networking are the rarest talent in the Ethernet transition." Accept at $252K+ base and $405K+ RSUs.
