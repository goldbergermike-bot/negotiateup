**Negotiation DNA**

Arista Engineering Managers lead the teams building the networking software that powers every major AI data center — managing 8-15 engineers across EOS development, lossless Ethernet protocols, switching silicon integration, and cloud networking features. Your team's velocity determines how fast Arista ships 800G R4 features, how quickly lossless Ethernet capabilities match InfiniBand, and whether Arista wins the hyperscaler evaluations that drive billion-dollar deployment decisions.

**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

Engineering Managers during the Ethernet transition build and lead the teams executing the 800G R4 roadmap — hiring engineers, shipping lossless features, and winning hyperscaler evaluations. "As an Engineering Manager, I build the team that ships 800G lossless Ethernet features to win against InfiniBand. A $525K+ RSU grant with Year 1 front-loading captures the team-multiplier impact during the transition. The script: 'I build and lead the team shipping 800G features that win hyperscaler evaluations. My team multiplier effect during the Ethernet transition justifies $525K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my Year 1 hiring and execution impact is maximum.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density — Team Build Impact:** "I build the team shipping 800G features. $525K+ RSUs with Year 1 front-loading — my hiring and execution impact during the transition is maximum in Year 1."
2. **Hyperscaler Delivery Execution:** "My team delivers the 800G features that hyperscalers evaluate against InfiniBand. Winning these evaluations drives revenue worth billions. My team's execution directly converts to deployment wins."
3. **8-15 Engineer Multiplier:** "I manage 8-15 engineers delivering $500K+ in annual output each. My management multiplier means $4M-$7.5M in engineering value annually — during a competitive transition, this leverage is maximum."
4. **Cisco/Juniper EM Competition:** "Cisco and Juniper EMs earn $475K+ TC. Arista's growth trajectory and AI networking momentum justify premium EM RSUs to attract management talent from larger competitors."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $278K base and $525K RSUs over 4 years with Year 1 front-loading for this Engineering Manager role during the Ethernet transition. I build the team shipping 800G lossless features that win hyperscaler evaluations. I have competing offers from [Cisco EM at $478K TC / Google EM Networking at $485K TC / Juniper EM at $458K TC]. EMs building teams during the InfiniBand displacement are Arista's execution bottleneck." Accept at $262K+ base and $468K+ RSUs.
