**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

Security engineers during the Ethernet transition ensure that 800G lossless features don't compromise network security — securing new protocols and validating that performance optimization doesn't create vulnerabilities. "As a Security Engineer, I secure the 800G lossless features that win against InfiniBand — ensuring performance and security coexist. I want $332K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my security validation enables every 800G deployment."

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density — Security Validation:** "I secure 800G lossless features for production deployment. $332K+ RSUs with Year 1 density — my security validation enables every hyperscaler deployment."
2. **AI Data Center Network Security:** "I protect the network fabric carrying AI training data worth billions. Network security at this level has national security implications — AI training data exposure could compromise competitive AI advantages."
3. **Zero-Trust Networking Features:** "I build zero-trust networking features into EOS — the security capabilities that enterprise and government customers require. These features differentiate Arista in security-sensitive deployments."
4. **Palo Alto/Cisco Security Parity:** "Palo Alto and Cisco security engineers earn $365K+ TC. Arista network security engineers protecting AI data centers deserve competitive security comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base and $332K RSUs over 4 years with Year 1 density for this Security Engineer role. I secure 800G lossless Ethernet features and protect AI data center network fabric worth billions. I have competing offers from [Palo Alto Security at $365K TC / Cisco Security at $358K TC / Google Security at $375K TC]. Network security engineers protecting AI training infrastructure deserve premium comp." Accept at $228K+ base and $298K+ RSUs.
