**Negotiation DNA**

Arista Staff Software Engineers define the technical architecture of the world's most deployed AI networking platform — EOS system design, switching silicon abstraction layers, distributed state protocols, and the next-generation networking paradigms that will carry AI data centers from 800G to 1.6T and beyond. At the Staff level, your architectural decisions shape how the entire networking industry evolves for AI workloads. You define whether Ethernet fully displaces InfiniBand — a multi-billion dollar competitive outcome that hinges on your system architecture. [Source: Arista Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

Staff architects during the Ethernet transition define the system architecture that determines the long-term competitive outcome. Your design decisions create the technical moat that sustains Arista's market position for the next decade. "As a Staff Software Engineer, I define the system architecture that determines whether Ethernet permanently displaces InfiniBand. A $675K+ RSU grant with maximum Year 1 density captures the stock appreciation from this architectural inflection. The script: 'I define the networking architecture for the AI era — the system design that permanently wins the InfiniBand war. Staff architects making decade-defining decisions deserve $675K+ RSUs with maximum Year 1 front-loading.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density — Staff Architecture:** "I define the system architecture for AI networking's next decade. $675K+ RSUs with Year 1 front-loading — Staff architects making decade-defining decisions during architectural inflections deserve maximum equity density."
2. **800G to 1.6T Roadmap Definition:** "I define the technical roadmap from 800G through 1.6T — the architecture that determines Arista's competitive position through 2030. This roadmap definition at the Staff level has multi-billion dollar revenue implications."
3. **InfiniBand Displacement Architecture:** "My system architecture determines whether Ethernet permanently displaces InfiniBand for AI networking. This competitive outcome is worth billions in annual revenue. Staff architects who define this outcome deserve commensurate equity."
4. **Google L6/Meta Staff Parity:** "Google L6 and Meta Staff network engineers earn $600K+ TC. Arista Staff architects have arguably more impact on AI networking's future. Staff comp must match FAANG to attract architectural talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $315K base and $675K RSUs over 4 years with maximum Year 1 density for this Staff Software Engineer role. I define the system architecture that permanently displaces InfiniBand with Lossless Ethernet — a multi-billion dollar competitive outcome. I have competing offers from [Google L6 Networking at $605K TC / Cisco Distinguished at $578K TC / Meta Staff at $598K TC]. Staff architects defining AI networking's future architecture are the most consequential hires in the industry." Accept at $292K+ base and $598K+ RSUs.
