**Negotiation DNA**

Arista Senior Software Engineers own critical subsystems of EOS — the network operating system running in every major AI data center. You architect the lossless Ethernet protocols, RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) implementations, and adaptive routing algorithms that enable GPU-to-GPU communication at wire speed with zero packet loss. Your senior technical decisions determine whether Arista's 800G R4 can match InfiniBand's latency while delivering Ethernet's cost and flexibility advantages — the competitive benchmark that wins hyperscaler deployments worth billions.

**800G Lossless Ethernet — The Year 1 Equity Density Play**

Senior engineers during the Ethernet transition architect the protocol-level innovations that prove Lossless Ethernet matches InfiniBand for AI training — RoCE optimization, adaptive routing, congestion control. Your architecture determines the competitive outcome. "As a Senior Software Engineer, I architect the lossless protocols that determine whether Ethernet wins the AI networking war. A front-loaded RSU grant of $438K+ over 4 years with maximum Year 1 density captures the stock appreciation during this transition. The script: 'I architect the RoCE and lossless protocols that prove Ethernet beats InfiniBand. Every hyperscaler evaluation depends on my architecture delivering zero-loss 800G performance. I want $438K+ RSUs with Year 1 front-loading — senior architects during architectural transitions deserve maximum equity density.'"

**Global Levers**

1. **Year 1 Equity Density — Senior Architecture:** "I architect the lossless protocols winning the InfiniBand war. $438K+ RSUs with Year 1 front-loading captures the stock appreciation from senior-level architectural impact during the most consequential networking transition."
2. **RoCE/Lossless Protocol Ownership:** "I own the RoCE implementation and lossless Ethernet protocols that enable AI training over Ethernet. This protocol architecture is the competitive weapon that wins against InfiniBand — my ownership justifies top-of-band senior RSUs."
3. **Hyperscaler Evaluation Impact:** "Every hyperscaler AI networking evaluation benchmarks my lossless protocols against InfiniBand. Winning these evaluations drives revenue worth billions. My senior architecture directly converts to deployment wins."
4. **Cisco/Juniper Senior Talent Premium:** "Cisco and Juniper senior engineers earn $420K+ TC. Arista's AI networking growth and stock trajectory justify premium senior RSUs to attract architects from larger competitors."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $262K base and $438K RSUs over 4 years with Year 1 front-loading for this Senior Software Engineer role during the Ethernet transition. I architect the lossless protocols that win against InfiniBand in hyperscaler evaluations. I have competing offers from [Cisco Sr. at $422K TC / Google L5 Networking at $435K TC / Juniper Sr. at $405K TC]. Senior architects winning the InfiniBand-to-Ethernet war are Arista's highest-impact hires." Accept at $245K+ base and $395K+ RSUs.
