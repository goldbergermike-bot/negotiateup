**Negotiation DNA**

Data scientists at Brex work with one of the richest corporate spending datasets in the market — billions of dollars in card transactions, bill payments, expense reports, and travel bookings across thousands of mid-market and enterprise companies. This dataset powers Brex's AI spend intelligence: category benchmarking, vendor negotiation insights, anomaly detection, and predictive budget forecasting. Your models don't just generate analytics — they create the product differentiation that justifies Brex's premium pricing.

Brex's data science work is core to the business strategy. Every model you build directly informs the AI features that enterprise CFOs evaluate when choosing between Brex and Ramp. The quality of your spend intelligence models determines whether Brex is perceived as a premium strategic platform or a commodity corporate card. [Source: Brex Data Science Team 2025-2026]

### AI Spend Intelligence Models Lever

Brex's AI spend intelligence depends on data science models that transform raw transaction data into strategic insights. Category benchmarking models compare a company's spending against industry peers; anomaly detection models flag unusual patterns; forecasting models predict budget utilization; and vendor intelligence models identify negotiation opportunities. Each model creates a new product feature that adds value and reduces churn.

If you have experience with financial analytics, spend analysis, or enterprise ML products, you're building the exact models Brex needs. The combination of financial domain knowledge and modern ML techniques is rare in the market.
