**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps engineers at Brex maintain the infrastructure for a platform that processes billions in corporate transactions annually. Downtime at Brex means companies can't pay vendors, employees can't use corporate cards, and expense reports can't be processed — operational chaos for thousands of businesses. Brex's SLA requirements are financial-grade: 99.99%+ uptime, sub-150ms card authorization latency, and zero data loss. Meeting these requirements across a distributed, cloud-native architecture requires exceptional infrastructure expertise.

Brex's infrastructure must support three distinct workload profiles: real-time financial transactions (card authorizations, wire transfers), AI/ML workloads (model training, real-time inference), and enterprise compliance (audit logs, data residency, SOC 2). DevOps engineers who can optimize for all three — performance, intelligence, and compliance — carry a premium over single-dimension infrastructure engineers.

### AI Infrastructure Lever

Brex's AI features require infrastructure that traditional spend management platforms don't: GPU compute for model training, model serving for real-time inference, and feature stores that power AI-driven spend insights. DevOps engineers who can manage both financial transaction infrastructure and AI/ML infrastructure are exactly the profile Brex needs as the company embeds AI across every product surface.

If you have experience with MLOps alongside traditional cloud infrastructure, frame this dual expertise as a premium — it's the rarest combination in fintech DevOps.

**Global Levers**

1. **Financial Transaction Reliability:** "I maintain infrastructure that processes billions in corporate transactions. Downtime means companies can't operate. My reliability engineering directly protects Brex's most critical business function."
2. **Triple-Workload Infrastructure:** "I optimize for financial transactions, AI workloads, and compliance simultaneously. This trifecta of infrastructure demands is unique to AI-first financial platforms."
3. **AI Infrastructure Expertise:** "I bring MLOps experience — model serving, GPU orchestration, inference optimization — alongside traditional infrastructure skills. This combination is exactly what Brex needs for its AI strategy."
4. **Remote Infrastructure Reliability:** "I maintain financial-grade infrastructure in a remote-first environment. Distributed incident response and infrastructure management across time zones requires specialized expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $225K over 4 years with a $20K signing bonus. I maintain the infrastructure that processes billions in transactions while building the AI infrastructure for Brex's competitive differentiation." Brex will counter at $178K-$210K equity — accept at $198K+ with the signing bonus.
