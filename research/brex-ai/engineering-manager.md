**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering managers at Brex lead teams through one of the most competitive landscapes in fintech. The company has gone through strategic refocusing — cutting products (dropping small business customers to focus on mid-market/enterprise), restructuring teams, and doubling down on AI differentiation. EMs at Brex today manage teams that have survived this refocusing and need leadership that provides both stability and vision. This is harder than managing a team at a steadily growing company — you need to rebuild confidence while accelerating delivery.

Brex's EM role carries both people management and technical accountability. You're expected to participate in architecture decisions, manage incident response, and drive cross-team coordination — not just manage people. The remote-first environment means building team culture and maintaining engineering velocity across time zones requires deliberate leadership practices.

### AI Spend Team Leadership Lever

The AI spend team at Brex is the company's highest-visibility engineering investment. EMs on this team manage engineers who build the AI features that differentiate Brex in the market. You're not managing a maintenance team — you're leading the team that defines Brex's competitive positioning. The pressure is high: every quarter, the AI team needs to ship features that justify Brex's premium pricing against Ramp's cost-leader strategy.

If you have experience managing AI/ML teams alongside product engineering teams, you carry a premium. The ability to keep ML experimentation velocity high while maintaining production reliability requires a specific leadership balance.

**Global Levers**

1. **Post-Refocus Leadership Premium:** "Brex's teams have been through strategic changes. I bring the leadership stability and vision needed to rebuild confidence while accelerating delivery. This change management expertise is worth a premium over steady-state EM roles."
2. **AI Team Management:** "I manage the team building Brex's AI competitive differentiation. This is the highest-visibility engineering investment at the company — and my leadership directly determines whether Brex wins or loses against Ramp."
3. **Remote Team Culture:** "I build and maintain high-performing engineering culture in a remote-first environment. This distributed leadership expertise is essential for Brex's operating model."
4. **Enterprise Delivery Accountability:** "As Brex moves upmarket, my team ships features for enterprise customers with strict SLAs and security requirements. Enterprise delivery accountability adds complexity beyond startup-pace engineering."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $410K over 4 years with a $38K signing bonus and a guaranteed first-year bonus floor of 15%. I'm leading the AI team that defines Brex's competitive positioning — the comp should reflect both the strategic importance and the change management complexity." Brex will counter at $330K-$380K equity — accept at $360K+ with the signing bonus and bonus guarantee.
