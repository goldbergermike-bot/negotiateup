**Negotiation DNA**

Senior engineers at Brex own critical product domains — the corporate card platform, bill pay infrastructure, expense automation, travel integration, or AI-powered spend analytics. Brex's engineering culture emphasizes ownership and velocity: you're expected to drive technical decisions within your domain and ship production features without extensive process overhead. This autonomy is both a benefit and a responsibility — senior engineers are the quality bar for their domains.

Brex's competitive landscape has intensified: Ramp is growing aggressively with a cost-leader strategy, Navan dominates travel spend, and traditional banks are building competing products. Brex's response is differentiation through AI — using intelligence to make spend management strategic rather than administrative. Senior engineers who can build these AI-differentiated features while maintaining the reliability of financial infrastructure are Brex's most important hires. The company's engineering team has been through layoffs and refocusing, which means current hiring is for roles that are clearly high-priority and well-funded.

### AI Spend Analytics Lever

Brex's AI spend analytics transforms raw transaction data into strategic insights: category-level benchmarking, vendor negotiation intelligence, budget forecasting, and anomaly detection. Senior engineers building these analytics features are creating the product capabilities that enterprise CFOs pay premium pricing for. Every AI insight that helps a CFO save money or make better decisions strengthens Brex's enterprise positioning.

If you have experience building analytics products, financial ML models, or enterprise dashboards, you're in the highest-demand segment for Brex hiring. The combination of financial data expertise and AI/ML skills translates directly to Brex's product roadmap.

**Global Levers**

1. **Domain Ownership Autonomy:** "At the senior level, I own an entire product domain at Brex. This ownership autonomy is broader than at larger companies — and my comp should reflect the scope of responsibility."
2. **AI Differentiation Builder:** "I build the AI features that differentiate Brex from Ramp and traditional expense tools. Every AI insight I ship strengthens Brex's enterprise positioning and justifies premium pricing."
3. **Post-Refocus Hiring Priority:** "Brex's engineering team has been refocused. Each hire is clearly high-priority and well-funded. My role isn't backfilling — it's strategically expanding capabilities that Brex has explicitly prioritized."
4. **Pre-IPO Equity Sizing:** "At the senior level, I want equity sized for the IPO scenario. Brex's AI spend thesis is compelling — I'm betting my career on it, and the grant should be at $340K+ to make that bet worthwhile."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $340K over 4 years with a $28K signing bonus. I'm a senior engineer building Brex's AI differentiator — the features that justify premium pricing against cost-leader competitors. The equity should reflect my role in Brex's enterprise value proposition." Brex will counter at $275K-$320K equity — accept at $300K+ with the signing bonus.
