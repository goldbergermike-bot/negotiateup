**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI engineers at Brex build the intelligence layer that transforms raw spending data into strategic business insights. Your models power spend categorization (classifying millions of transactions), anomaly detection (flagging unusual spending patterns in real time), vendor intelligence (identifying negotiation opportunities), budget forecasting (predicting spend trends), and fraud detection (protecting against unauthorized transactions). These models are not experimental — they're production ML that directly determines product quality and customer experience.

Brex's AI-first strategy makes ML/AI engineers the company's highest-priority technical hires in 2026. The company's competitive thesis against Ramp hinges on AI intelligence superiority — Ramp competes on price, Brex competes on intelligence. Every model improvement strengthens this positioning. Brex competes for AI talent against Ramp (AI procurement), Mercury (AI banking), and Big Tech — all offering competitive packages. [Source: Brex AI/ML Team 2025-2026]

### AI Spend Intelligence Models Lever

Brex's spend intelligence platform requires models that operate under enterprise-grade constraints: accuracy (CFOs make decisions based on your insights), latency (real-time anomaly detection in milliseconds), explainability (enterprise customers need to understand why spending was flagged), and scalability (processing billions in transactions across thousands of companies). Building models that satisfy all four constraints is the core ML challenge.

If you have experience with financial ML, anomaly detection, or enterprise analytics ML, you carry a premium. The combination of ML engineering skills and financial spend domain knowledge directly translates to Brex's product roadmap.

**Global Levers**

1. **Competitive Intelligence Layer:** "My models are the intelligence layer that differentiates Brex from Ramp. Model quality equals product quality — and product quality determines whether enterprise customers choose Brex's premium or Ramp's discount."
2. **Unique Spend Dataset:** "Brex's corporate spending dataset is proprietary. The models I build on this data create insights no competitor can replicate — my equity should reflect this unique value creation."
3. **Enterprise ML Constraints:** "I build models that are accurate, real-time, explainable, and scalable simultaneously. This enterprise-grade ML engineering is more demanding than standard ML roles."
4. **AI-First Talent Priority:** "Brex has publicly committed to AI-first spend management. ML engineers are the highest-priority hires. My comp should reflect this strategic priority."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $318K over 4 years with a $32K signing bonus. My models directly determine whether Brex wins the AI spend intelligence category. This is the company's primary competitive bet, and my work is at the center of it." Brex will counter at $255K-$295K equity — accept at $278K+ with the signing bonus.
