### Product Manager | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Late-Stage Private | AI-Powered Spend Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $168K–$210K | $178K–$290K | 15–20% | $225K–$310K |
| New York | $163K–$205K | $172K–$280K | 15–20% | $218K–$302K |
| Remote (US) | $152K–$192K | $155K–$252K | 15–20% | $202K–$278K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product managers at Brex define the spend management experience for enterprise CFOs and finance teams. This is not a standard B2B SaaS PM role — you're managing financial products where compliance requirements constrain the solution space, where enterprise customers have complex multi-entity structures, and where the competitive landscape changes quarterly (Ramp, Navan, and traditional banks all actively building competing features). Brex PMs must understand financial operations, compliance requirements, and enterprise buying cycles alongside traditional PM skills.

Brex's product strategy has been deliberately narrowed: the company exited small business to focus on mid-market and enterprise customers. This focus means each PM owns a more clearly defined product domain with higher revenue-per-customer impact. PMs who can navigate the enterprise product cycle — longer sales cycles, security reviews, custom requirements — while maintaining product innovation velocity are exactly what Brex needs.

### AI Spend Product Strategy Lever

Brex's AI spend intelligence is the company's primary product differentiation. PMs defining the AI product strategy are answering the fundamental question: how does AI transform spend management from an administrative burden into a strategic capability? This isn't incremental feature work — it's category definition. The PM who gets this right creates a product moat that competitors can't easily replicate.

If you have PM experience with AI products, enterprise financial tools, or spend management, you're in the highest-demand segment. The intersection of AI product sense and financial domain knowledge is exceptionally rare.

**Global Levers**

1. **Category Definition:** "I'm defining how AI transforms spend management. This is category creation, not feature iteration — and the PM who gets this right creates Brex's competitive moat."
2. **Enterprise Financial Expertise:** "I understand enterprise financial operations, multi-entity structures, and CFO buying criteria. This domain expertise takes years to develop and is essential for Brex's upmarket strategy."
3. **Competitive Positioning Authority:** "Every product decision I make is a competitive positioning decision against Ramp, Navan, and traditional banks. I need to understand the entire competitive landscape and make strategic trade-offs."
4. **AI Product Sense:** "I have experience defining AI product strategy — understanding what AI can and can't do, and translating AI capabilities into product experiences that enterprise users trust and adopt."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $270K over 4 years with a $22K signing bonus. I'm defining Brex's AI spend strategy — the product vision that determines whether Brex wins the enterprise spend management category or becomes a commodity player." Brex will counter at $215K-$252K equity — accept at $240K+ with the signing bonus.
