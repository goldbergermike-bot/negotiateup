### Product Designer | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Late-Stage Private | AI-Powered Spend Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $152K–$192K | $128K–$208K | 10–15% | $188K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product designers at Brex design the enterprise spend management experience. Unlike consumer design where delight is the goal, enterprise financial design requires clarity, trust, and efficiency. CFOs and finance teams use Brex daily to manage millions in corporate spending — a confusing interface means wasted time, approval bottlenecks, and potential compliance errors. Every design decision has operational consequences for the businesses using Brex.

Brex has historically invested in design quality, and the company's UI is recognized as best-in-class for corporate finance tools. Designers at Brex maintain this quality bar while expanding into new domains: AI-powered insights, complex approval workflows, multi-entity dashboards, and travel management. The challenge is making increasingly complex financial operations feel simple — a skill that separates great financial product designers from good ones.

### AI Spend UX Lever

Designing AI features for enterprise finance requires a unique skill: making AI outputs actionable in a context where users have limited time and high stakes. An AI spend insight that's hard to understand or act on is worse than no insight at all — it creates noise in a workflow that demands clarity. Designers who can transform complex AI outputs into simple, trustworthy, actionable interfaces are the most valuable hires for Brex's AI product strategy.

If you have experience designing AI-powered enterprise tools, especially in financial or analytical contexts, you carry a premium. The intersection of enterprise UX, financial product design, and AI interaction design is the hottest niche in the B2B design market.

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Financial Design Expertise:** "I design complex financial workflows — spend dashboards, approval chains, multi-entity structures — that feel simple. This enterprise financial design expertise takes years to develop."
2. **AI Interaction Design:** "I design AI features that transform complex outputs into simple, actionable interfaces. Making AI trustworthy and useful in enterprise finance is a rare design skill."
3. **Design Quality Maintenance:** "Brex's design quality is a competitive advantage. I maintain and extend this quality bar while designing for increasingly complex enterprise use cases."
4. **Operational Impact of Design:** "My design decisions have operational consequences — a confusing approval workflow means compliance errors, and a cluttered dashboard means missed spending anomalies. Design quality directly impacts business operations."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $192K over 4 years with a $18K signing bonus. Brex's design quality is a competitive differentiator, and I'm extending that quality into AI-powered enterprise experiences." Brex will counter at $155K-$180K equity — accept at $168K+ with the signing bonus.
