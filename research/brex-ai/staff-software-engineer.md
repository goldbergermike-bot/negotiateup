### Staff Software Engineer | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Late-Stage Private | AI-Powered Spend Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $235K–$280K | $350K–$530K | 10–15% | $335K–$430K |
| New York | $230K–$275K | $340K–$510K | 10–15% | $325K–$420K |
| Remote (US) | $215K–$258K | $310K–$465K | 10–15% | $302K–$395K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff engineers at Brex set the technical direction for the entire spend management platform. You're defining the architecture, API contracts, and system boundaries that determine whether Brex can scale from mid-market to large enterprise while maintaining the velocity that made the company successful. At the staff level, Brex is competing directly with Stripe, Block, and Big Tech for talent — and the company knows that losing a staff engineer means losing months of architectural momentum.

Brex's technical evolution requires staff engineers who can lead the platform migration from startup-era infrastructure to enterprise-grade systems. The spending data pipeline, card processing platform, and compliance infrastructure all need architectural evolution to support enterprise customers with complex multi-entity structures, custom approval workflows, and global spend visibility. Staff engineers who can lead this migration while maintaining production reliability are exactly what Brex needs. [Source: Brex Engineering, Blind Reports 2025-2026]

### AI Platform Architecture Lever

At the staff level, you're defining Brex's AI architecture — the model serving infrastructure, feature stores, LLM orchestration, and data pipelines that power AI features across the entire spend platform. These architectural decisions determine whether AI capabilities scale across all Brex products (cards, expenses, bill pay, travel) or remain siloed experiments. Getting this right positions Brex as an AI-native spend platform; getting it wrong creates technical debt that slows every product team for years.

Your negotiation should emphasize the irreplaceability of this platform thinking. Brex has engineers who can build features; they need someone who can design the AI architecture that connects everything.

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Architecture Scarcity:** "Staff engineers who can design AI architectures for enterprise financial platforms are exceptionally rare. I'm not building features — I'm defining the architecture that determines Brex's product velocity for the next 3-5 years."
2. **Enterprise Scale Migration:** "Brex needs to evolve from startup infrastructure to enterprise-grade systems. I lead this migration while maintaining production reliability — the most complex technical challenge at Brex."
3. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "At the staff level, I have liquid RSU options from Stripe, Google, and Meta. Brex's private equity needs to offer a 1.5-2x premium to compensate for illiquidity risk."
4. **409A Transparency:** "Before evaluating the equity offer, I need the latest 409A valuation, preferred share price, and IPO timeline guidance. I'm making a multi-year bet — I need the data."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $500K over 4 years with a $50K signing bonus. I'm defining Brex's AI platform architecture and leading the enterprise infrastructure migration — the two most strategic technical initiatives at the company. I also want the latest 409A and an acceleration clause for IPO within 24 months." Brex will counter at $400K-$465K equity — accept at $440K+ with the signing bonus and acceleration clause.
