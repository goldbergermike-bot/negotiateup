**Negotiation DNA**

Data engineers at Brex build the pipelines that transform billions in corporate transactions into the structured data that powers AI spend intelligence, compliance reporting, and product analytics. Brex's data infrastructure must handle real-time card transaction processing, batch spend analytics, ML feature serving, and compliance audit trails — all within financial regulatory requirements. The data engineering challenge is both scale (billions in transactions) and sensitivity (corporate financial data with strict access controls).

Brex's lean data engineering team means each engineer owns a disproportionately large portion of the data platform. You're not building a single pipeline — you're maintaining and evolving the entire data infrastructure that AI features, analytics, compliance, and product teams depend on.

### AI Spend Data Pipeline Lever

Brex's AI spend intelligence features depend on data pipelines that transform raw card transactions into ML-ready features. The data engineering challenge is building pipelines that can serve both historical batch processing (for model training and benchmarking) and real-time streaming (for anomaly detection and instant categorization). If you have experience with unified batch-stream architectures for financial data, you're solving Brex's most pressing data infrastructure challenge.

Every new AI feature requires new feature pipelines, and pipeline quality directly determines model quality and product quality. Data engineers are the foundation of Brex's AI strategy.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Foundation Layer:** "My pipelines are the foundation of Brex's AI spend intelligence. Pipeline quality determines model quality, which determines product quality. I'm the base layer of the competitive differentiation stack."
2. **Financial Data Compliance:** "I build pipelines for corporate financial data with strict access controls and audit requirements. This regulated data engineering is more demanding than standard pipeline work."
3. **Full-Stack Data Ownership:** "Brex's lean data team means I own a disproportionately large portion of the data platform. My ownership scope exceeds what most data engineer roles offer."
4. **Batch-Stream Unification:** "I bring experience unifying batch and streaming pipelines for financial data. This architectural expertise directly enables Brex's real-time AI features."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $222K over 4 years with a $18K signing bonus. My data pipelines power every AI feature, analytics dashboard, and compliance report at Brex. The equity should reflect this foundational role." Brex will counter at $175K-$205K equity — accept at $195K+ with the signing bonus.
