**Negotiation DNA**

Technical program managers at Brex coordinate the most complex cross-functional initiatives in enterprise spend management: enterprise customer onboarding programs (migrating large companies onto Brex with custom integration, compliance, and training requirements), regulatory compliance programs (PCI DSS, SOC 2, financial regulations), and platform-wide initiatives like the AI feature rollout that spans every product team. TPMs at Brex manage dependencies across engineering, product, enterprise sales, compliance, and external partners.

Brex's 2026 priorities — AI feature deployment, enterprise expansion, and international preparation — all require heavy TPM investment. The company's post-refocus operating model means TPMs must be efficient: there's no room for process overhead that doesn't directly accelerate delivery. TPMs who can drive complex programs with minimal process drag are exactly what Brex values. [Source: Brex Program Management 2025-2026]

### AI Feature Rollout Lever

Brex's AI feature rollout is a company-wide program that touches every product surface: cards, expenses, bill pay, travel, and enterprise dashboards. TPMs coordinating this rollout manage dependencies across ML engineering (model readiness), product (feature definition), design (UX), compliance (AI governance), and enterprise sales (customer communication). This cross-company AI program coordination is the highest-visibility TPM work at Brex.

If you have experience managing AI/ML product launches across multiple product teams, you're exactly the TPM profile Brex needs for its most strategic initiative.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Company AI Coordination:** "I coordinate Brex's AI feature rollout across every product team. This company-wide AI program management is the highest-visibility TPM work — and my comp should reflect the strategic scope."
2. **Enterprise Onboarding Programs:** "I manage enterprise customer onboarding with custom integration, compliance, and training requirements. Each successful onboarding directly enables revenue — and each failed one risks churn."
3. **Lean Process Efficiency:** "Brex values TPMs who drive results with minimal process overhead. I deliver complex program outcomes without bureaucratic drag — exactly the operating style Brex needs."
4. **Compliance Program Expertise:** "I manage PCI DSS, SOC 2, and financial regulatory programs. This compliance TPM expertise ensures Brex meets audit deadlines without engineering velocity loss."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $230K over 4 years with a $20K signing bonus. I coordinate Brex's most strategic programs — the company-wide AI rollout and enterprise customer onboarding. My comp should reflect the scope of these programs." Brex will counter at $180K-$215K equity — accept at $200K+ with the signing bonus.
