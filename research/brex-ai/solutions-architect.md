### Solutions Architect | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Late-Stage Private | AI-Powered Spend Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $168K–$212K | $158K–$258K | 15–20% | $218K–$298K |
| New York | $163K–$208K | $153K–$248K | 15–20% | $212K–$290K |
| Remote (US) | $152K–$195K | $138K–$228K | 15–20% | $198K–$272K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions architects at Brex design integration architectures for enterprise customers migrating to the Brex spend management platform. This involves connecting Brex to existing ERP systems (NetSuite, SAP, Oracle), accounting tools (QuickBooks, Xero), HRIS platforms (Workday, BambooHR), and travel management systems. Each enterprise customer has a unique technology stack, and your integration design directly determines whether the migration succeeds or fails.

Brex's enterprise push means solutions architects are critical to revenue growth. Enterprise deals are larger ($500K-$5M+ annually) but require significant pre-sales and post-sales technical support. Your technical credibility during the sales process directly influences deal closure — enterprise CFOs won't commit their company's financial infrastructure to a platform without confidence that the integration will work.

### AI Spend Integration Lever

Brex's AI spend intelligence creates new integration opportunities: AI-generated insights can be piped into ERP dashboards, automated categorization can sync with accounting systems, and AI-powered forecasts can feed into corporate planning tools. Solutions architects who can design these AI-enabled integrations — connecting Brex's AI outputs to customers' existing financial workflows — directly increase deal sizes and customer value.

If you have experience integrating AI/ML products into enterprise financial systems, you're in a niche that Brex desperately needs as it differentiates through intelligence rather than price.

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Deal Enablement:** "I directly enable enterprise deal closures worth $500K-$5M+ annually. My technical credibility during sales determines whether enterprise prospects become customers."
2. **ERP Integration Expertise:** "I design integrations between Brex and NetSuite, SAP, Workday, and other enterprise systems. This multi-platform integration expertise is essential for Brex's enterprise motion."
3. **AI Integration Design:** "I design integrations that connect Brex's AI spend insights to customers' ERP and planning tools. These AI-enabled integrations increase customer value and deal sizes."
4. **Migration Risk Mitigation:** "Every enterprise migration I design moves a company's financial operations to Brex. Flawless migration design protects Brex's reputation and prevents customer churn."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $242K over 4 years with a $22K signing bonus and clarity on commission or deal-based comp. I directly enable enterprise revenue, and my comp should include variable components tied to deals I influence." Brex will counter at $192K-$225K equity — accept at $212K+ with the signing bonus and variable comp clarity.
