### AI Spend Intelligence Engineer | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Late-Stage Private | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15–30% AI SPEND PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $198K–$258K | $270K–$450K | 10–15% | $275K–$385K |
| New York | $193K–$252K | $260K–$435K | 10–15% | $268K–$375K |
| Remote (US) | $180K–$238K | $238K–$400K | 10–15% | $248K–$348K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is Brex's signature role for 2026 — the AI Spend Intelligence Engineer. You're building the AI platform that transforms corporate spending data into strategic business intelligence: real-time spend categorization, anomaly detection, vendor benchmarking, predictive budget forecasting, and AI-powered procurement recommendations. This role combines NLP (parsing transaction descriptions and invoice data), time-series ML (forecasting spend trends), anomaly detection (flagging unusual patterns), and LLM orchestration (powering conversational spend insights) into a single engineering discipline. No other company builds AI spend intelligence at this scale and depth.

Brex's entire competitive thesis against Ramp hinges on intelligence superiority. Ramp competes on price — offering cashback and lower fees. Brex competes on intelligence — offering AI-powered insights that transform spend management from cost administration into strategic decision-making. The AI Spend Intelligence Engineer is the person who makes that thesis real. Every model you deploy, every insight your system surfaces, and every automated workflow you enable directly determines whether CFOs perceive Brex as a premium strategic platform or switch to Ramp's cheaper alternative.

**Level Mapping:** Brex AI Spend Eng (Senior) = Google L4-L5 ML = Stripe L3-L4 ML = Ramp Senior ML

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The AI Spend Intelligence Engineer builds systems that don't exist at other fintech companies in this form:
- **Multi-Signal Categorization:** NLP models that classify transactions using merchant data, receipt OCR, email confirmations, and contextual signals simultaneously
- **Predictive Budget Intelligence:** Time-series models that forecast departmental and company-wide spend trends with enough accuracy for CFOs to make resource allocation decisions
- **Anomaly Detection Network:** Real-time anomaly detection across thousands of companies that distinguishes genuine anomalies from normal variance using cross-company benchmarking
- **Conversational Spend AI:** LLM-powered interfaces that let CFOs ask natural-language questions about their company's spending and get instant, accurate answers

**Global Levers**

1. **Competitive Thesis Embodiment:** "I'm building the AI platform that proves Brex's competitive thesis: intelligence over price. If my models work, Brex wins the enterprise market. If they don't, Ramp's price advantage wins. My equity should reflect this existential product bet."
2. **No-Equivalent-Role Scarcity:** "This role — AI spend intelligence at enterprise scale — doesn't exist at other companies. There's no direct comp benchmark for building multi-signal categorization, predictive budgeting, and conversational spend AI in a single platform."
3. **AI Spend Premium (15-30%):** "I'm building the intelligence that transforms spend management into strategic decision-making. This isn't generic ML — it's the AI that determines Brex's market positioning. I want the full 30% premium."
4. **CFO Decision Impact:** "My models directly influence how CFOs allocate budgets, negotiate with vendors, and make resource decisions. The business impact of my work is measured in millions of dollars in customer savings."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the AI platform that defines Brex's competitive positioning against Ramp. I'd like the RSU grant at $430K over 4 years, with the AI Spend premium fully applied, plus a $45K signing bonus to offset pre-IPO illiquidity. I also want a guaranteed first-year refresh and the latest 409A valuation." Brex will counter at $350K-$400K RSUs — accept at $380K+ with the signing bonus and 409A transparency. This is Brex's highest-leverage engineering role.
