### Software Engineer | Brex Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy / Late-Stage Private | AI-Powered Spend Management

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$198K | $150K–$240K | 10–15% | $198K–$265K |
| New York | $155K–$192K | $145K–$230K | 10–15% | $192K–$258K |
| Remote (US) | $145K–$180K | $130K–$210K | 10–15% | $180K–$240K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Brex has transformed from a corporate credit card startup into a comprehensive AI-powered spend management platform. The company serves mid-market and enterprise customers with expense management, bill pay, corporate cards, travel, and — increasingly — AI-driven spend intelligence. Brex's 2025-2026 pivot to AI spend optimization is its primary differentiation strategy against Ramp, Navan, and traditional expense platforms. The company's valuation sits around $12B, and its path to IPO depends on demonstrating that AI transforms spend management from a cost center into a strategic capability.

Software engineers at Brex build financial infrastructure that processes billions in transactions annually. The engineering bar is high — Brex has historically hired from top tech companies and fintech unicorns. The company is remote-first with engineering hubs in SF, NYC, and international locations. Equity is pre-IPO with genuine upside if Brex's AI spend strategy succeeds, but carries illiquidity risk typical of late-stage private companies. Negotiate with both scenarios in mind.

### AI Spend Intelligence Lever

Brex's AI spend intelligence platform analyzes corporate spending patterns to surface savings, detect anomalies, and automate approval workflows. Engineers building these AI features are directly creating the product differentiation that justifies Brex's premium positioning. Every AI feature that saves a CFO time or money strengthens the case for Brex over cheaper alternatives.

If you have experience with financial data analysis, anomaly detection, or workflow automation, you're building the exact capabilities Brex needs. Frame your skills as directly accelerating Brex's AI spend strategy.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Spend Differentiation:** "Brex's AI features are the competitive moat against Ramp and traditional expense tools. I'm building the AI capabilities that justify Brex's premium pricing and enterprise positioning."
2. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "Brex's $12B valuation with a clear AI-driven IPO thesis means my equity has real upside. I want the grant sized for the IPO scenario — reflecting the potential 2-3x return."
3. **Financial Infrastructure Complexity:** "I'm building systems that process billions in transactions under financial compliance requirements. This regulated infrastructure complexity justifies above-market comp."
4. **Enterprise Platform Scale:** "Brex is serving mid-market and enterprise customers with complex spending workflows. The enterprise engineering challenges I solve directly enable Brex's upmarket revenue growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $220K over 4 years with a $18K signing bonus. Brex's AI spend strategy is the IPO thesis — and I'm building the features that prove that thesis. The equity should reflect the strategic importance of AI engineering." Brex will counter at $175K-$205K equity — accept at $195K+ with the signing bonus.
