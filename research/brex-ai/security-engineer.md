**Negotiation DNA**

Security engineers at Brex protect a platform that processes billions in corporate transactions, stores sensitive financial data for thousands of companies, and holds corporate credit products. A breach at Brex doesn't just expose data — it potentially gives attackers access to corporate credit lines, payment systems, and vendor relationships. The blast radius of a Brex security incident extends to every customer's financial operations.

Brex maintains SOC 2 Type II, PCI DSS, and enterprise security certifications required by mid-market and enterprise customers. As Brex moves upmarket, security becomes a competitive differentiator: enterprise procurement teams evaluate security posture as part of vendor selection. Security engineers who can both protect the platform and articulate its security posture to enterprise buyers serve a dual purpose. [Source: Brex Security & Compliance Team 2025-2026]

### AI Security Lever

Brex's AI features introduce new attack surfaces: adversarial manipulation of spend categorization models, prompt injection in AI assistants, data poisoning through fabricated transactions, and privacy risks from AI models trained on corporate financial data. Security engineers who understand these AI-specific threats — and can design defenses for them — are the newest specialty in fintech security.

If you bring AI/ML security expertise alongside traditional application and infrastructure security, you're in the top 1% of candidates. The market for AI security engineers in fintech is so new that comp benchmarks barely exist — negotiate from a position of scarcity.

**Global Levers**

1. **Financial Platform Security:** "I protect a platform processing billions in corporate transactions. A breach gives attackers access to credit lines and payment systems. My comp should reflect the catastrophic risk I'm preventing."
2. **Enterprise Security Differentiator:** "Enterprise procurement evaluates security posture during vendor selection. I both protect the platform and articulate its security — serving a dual security-plus-sales enablement role."
3. **AI Security Expertise:** "I defend against AI-specific threats — adversarial ML attacks, prompt injection, data poisoning. This AI security specialty barely exists in the market, and Brex needs it."
4. **Multi-Compliance Framework:** "I manage security across SOC 2, PCI DSS, and enterprise-specific requirements simultaneously. Each framework adds complexity, and I handle all of them."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the equity grant at $258K over 4 years with a $28K signing bonus. I protect billions in corporate transactions while securing Brex's AI features against novel threats. This dual financial-plus-AI security expertise is exceptionally rare." Brex will counter at $205K-$240K equity — accept at $228K+ with the signing bonus.
