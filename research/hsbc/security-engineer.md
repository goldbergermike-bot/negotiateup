#### Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at HSBC protect $3T+ in total assets and the financial data of 40+ million customers across 60+ countries. In an era of state-sponsored cyber attacks, sophisticated financial fraud, and rapidly evolving regulatory requirements, HSBC's cybersecurity function is not a cost center -- it is an existential imperative. A single major breach could trigger regulatory action, customer attrition, and share price collapse that far exceeds the cost of an entire security engineering team.

Under CEO Georges Elhedery's Asia-first strategy, Security Engineers face the unique challenge of protecting HSBC's expanding Asia infrastructure across some of the most complex threat environments on Earth. The 13.1% CAGR in Asia data center infrastructure means more attack surface, more regulatory frameworks, and more sophisticated threat actors. HSBC's Hong Kong and Singapore operations are targets for state-level cyber operations, making security engineering in these regions among the most demanding assignments in global banking.

The global shortage of cybersecurity talent is acute in Asia-Pacific, where demand outstrips supply by an estimated 3:1 ratio. Security Engineers with financial services experience, regulatory compliance knowledge (HKMA, MAS, PBOC cybersecurity frameworks), and Asia-Pacific threat intelligence capabilities are among the most difficult profiles for HSBC to hire. Candidates should negotiate from this position of extreme scarcity -- HSBC needs you more than you need HSBC.

#### Asia Boom — The Regional Sovereign Premium

Security Engineers are the guardians of HSBC's Asia infrastructure expansion. The 13.1% CAGR in Asia data center markets versus 9.2% in the US means more infrastructure to protect, more regulatory frameworks to comply with, and more sophisticated threat actors to defend against. HSBC's position as the dominant Western bank in Asia makes it a high-value target for cyber attacks from state-sponsored actors, organized crime syndicates, and activist hackers. Security Engineers who protect this infrastructure are performing a function that is literally existential for the bank.

- **Regional Sovereign Bonus for Security Engineers:** Security Engineers assigned to Asia infrastructure protection earn additive bonuses of £20K-£34K / $26K-$44K (London-based), HK$255K-HK$430K / $33K-$55K (Hong Kong-based), or S$44K-S$74K / $33K-$55K (Singapore-based). Bonuses are tied to security milestones: successful security assessments of new data center deployments, zero-breach records for Asia platforms, and regulatory audit completions with zero critical findings.

- **Asia Threat Landscape Premium:** Security Engineers with demonstrated expertise in Asia-Pacific threat intelligence -- including APT groups targeting financial institutions in Greater China, Southeast Asian cyber crime syndicates, and cross-border fraud networks -- earn an additional £10K-£18K / $13K-$23K annually. This premium reflects the specialized knowledge required to protect HSBC's highest-revenue and highest-threat region.

- **Regulatory Compliance Security Premium:** HSBC operates under cybersecurity regulations from HKMA (Hong Kong), MAS (Singapore), PBOC (China), RBI (India), and the FCA (UK). Security Engineers who hold certifications or demonstrated expertise in multiple Asia-Pacific regulatory cybersecurity frameworks earn a compliance premium of £8K-£14K / $10K-$18K annually. This premium stacks with cloud security certifications (CISSP, CCSP, AWS Security Specialty) for cumulative premiums of up to £20K-£32K / $26K-$41K.

- **Accelerated Path to Security Lead / CISO Track:** The demand for security leadership in HSBC's Asia operations far exceeds internal supply. Security Engineers on Regional Sovereign projects advance to Senior Security Engineer / Security Lead (GCB 4) within 2-3 years, with compensation reaching £255K-£360K / $327K-$461K TC. From Security Lead, the path to Regional CISO (GCB 3) opens within another 3-4 years, with compensation of £380K-£520K / $487K-$666K TC.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Threat Prevention Track Record**
Anchor on the quantified value of security incidents you have prevented: *"At my current role, I identified and remediated a critical vulnerability in our payment processing infrastructure that, if exploited, would have exposed $200M+ in customer assets. I also reduced our mean time to detect (MTTD) from 48 hours to 4 hours. HSBC's Asia platforms hold $1T+ in customer assets -- the value of preventing a single major breach far exceeds my compensation. I'm targeting £225K / $288K total compensation."*

**Lever 2 — Security Certification Stack**
Leverage your security certifications: *"I hold CISSP, OSCP, and AWS Security Specialty certifications, plus demonstrated expertise in HKMA and MAS cybersecurity frameworks. I understand HSBC pays compliance and certification premiums totaling £20K-£32K / $26K-$41K for this combination. I'd like these premiums reflected in my compensation from day one."*

**Lever 3 — Talent Scarcity Leverage**
The cybersecurity talent shortage is acute: *"The ISC2 cybersecurity workforce study shows a 3.4M global talent gap, with Asia-Pacific being the most underserved region. My combination of financial services security experience, Asia-Pacific threat intelligence expertise, and regulatory compliance knowledge matches fewer than 500 professionals globally. I'm asking for top-of-band compensation of £230K / $295K TC because the alternative cost of leaving this role unfilled is far higher."*

**Lever 4 — Regional Sovereign Security Assignment**
Lock in the Asia security assignment: *"I'd like to be assigned to the Asia Infrastructure Security Program, with the Regional Sovereign bonus of £20K-£34K / $26K-$44K and the Asia threat landscape premium of £10K-£18K / $13K-$23K. Combined with my standard package, this positions my total compensation at £253K-£285K / $324K-$365K, which reflects the criticality of securing HSBC's most strategically important infrastructure."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at £225K / $288K total compensation for London, positioning at the 80th percentile of the Security Engineer band. For Hong Kong, anchor at HK$2.25M / $288K; for Singapore, anchor at S$389K / $288K. Lead with your threat prevention track record, quantifying the value of breaches prevented and detection time improvements. Layer the Regional Sovereign bonus (£20K-£34K / $26K-$44K) plus Asia threat landscape premium (£10K-£18K / $13K-$23K) plus certification premiums (£8K-£14K / $10K-$18K) to reach £263K-£291K / $337K-$373K effective total compensation. Your walk-away floor is £190K / $243K for London, HK$1.90M / $243K for Hong Kong, S$328K / $243K for Singapore. If the offer falls short, negotiate a guaranteed Year 1 bonus of £25K / $32K, a certification development budget of £5K / $6K annually, and a 6-month review tied to Asia security deployment milestones.
