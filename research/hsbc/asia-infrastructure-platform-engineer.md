#### Role Definition — Why This Role Exists

The Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer is not a standard engineering role with an Asia label. It is a purpose-designed position created under CEO Georges Elhedery's directive to build HSBC's next-generation technology infrastructure across Asia-Pacific. This role was conceived in response to three converging forces:

1. **The Asia Data Center Boom:** Asia's data center market is growing at 13.1% CAGR versus 9.2% in the US -- a 42% growth rate differential that is reshaping global technology infrastructure investment. HSBC, which derives 60%+ of its revenue from Asia, must build technology infrastructure at a pace that matches or exceeds this growth rate.

2. **Sovereign Cloud Requirements:** China's Cybersecurity Law (CSL) and Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), Hong Kong's evolving data localization requirements, Singapore's MAS Technology Risk Management framework, and India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act each impose unique infrastructure requirements. No off-the-shelf cloud platform satisfies all of these simultaneously. HSBC needs engineers who can design and operate bespoke infrastructure that complies with every sovereign requirement while maintaining global interoperability.

3. **HSBC's Competitive Moat:** HSBC's 160+ year presence in Asia, its relationships with every major APAC central bank, and its unparalleled cross-border payment network create a competitive advantage that can only be sustained through technology infrastructure that is as deep and broad as its business relationships. The Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer is the person who builds and maintains that technology moat.

This SIGNATURE ROLE carries compensation at the intersection of Staff/Principal Engineer and Solutions Architect levels -- reflecting its dual requirement for deep technical expertise and broad strategic vision.

---

#### Negotiation DNA

The Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer at HSBC is arguably the most strategically important individual contributor role in global banking technology in 2026. This is not hyperbole. HSBC processes more cross-border trade finance than any other bank on Earth, and the infrastructure that enables this capability is being rebuilt from the ground up across Asia-Pacific. The person in this role does not merely contribute to HSBC's Asia strategy -- they are the human embodiment of it.

The 13.1% CAGR in Asia data center infrastructure versus 9.2% in the US is the macro backdrop, but the micro reality is even more compelling. HSBC is deploying new data center capacity in Hong Kong, Singapore, mainland China (multiple zones), India (Mumbai and Hyderabad), and ASEAN markets (Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok). Each deployment requires infrastructure platform engineering that satisfies sovereign cloud requirements, regulatory mandates, and the performance demands of a bank that processes $500B+ in daily transaction volume. The Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer designs, builds, and operates the platform layer that sits above bare metal and below application workloads -- the Kubernetes clusters, service meshes, observability stacks, networking fabrics, and storage tiers that make everything else possible.

HSBC's compensation for this role reflects its strategic importance and the extreme scarcity of qualified candidates. The profile requires a rare combination of skills: deep infrastructure engineering expertise (Kubernetes at scale, multi-cloud orchestration, network engineering), domain knowledge (financial services regulatory compliance, sovereign cloud architecture), and regional expertise (understanding of APAC data sovereignty laws, experience operating infrastructure across Asian markets). Fewer than 200 professionals globally possess this combination, and HSBC is competing for them against hyperscalers (Google Cloud, AWS, Azure), sovereign cloud providers (Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud), and every other global bank attempting its own Asia expansion.

Candidates for this role should negotiate with the confidence that comes from being one of the most sought-after profiles in global technology. You are not asking HSBC for a job -- you are offering HSBC the capability to execute its highest-priority strategic initiative. Price accordingly.

#### Asia Boom — The Regional Sovereign Premium

This section takes on special significance for the SIGNATURE ROLE because the Regional Sovereign premium is not an additive bonus -- it is woven into the fabric of the role itself. The Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer exists because of the Asia Boom. The 13.1% CAGR in Asia data center infrastructure versus 9.2% in the US is not a market statistic this role observes -- it is a market reality this role creates.

HSBC's position as the dominant Western bank in Asia is a function of its physical and digital infrastructure. The Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer is responsible for ensuring that HSBC's technology infrastructure grows at or above the 13.1% CAGR, maintaining the bank's competitive advantage as global financial services tilts decisively toward Asia-Pacific. This role has direct visibility to HSBC's Group CTO and indirect visibility to CEO Georges Elhedery's strategic planning office.

- **Integrated Regional Sovereign Compensation:** Unlike other HSBC technology roles where the Regional Sovereign bonus is additive, the Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer's compensation already incorporates sovereign premium pricing into its base band. However, project-specific milestone bonuses remain additive: £40K-£68K / $51K-$87K (London-based), HK$510K-HK$860K / $65K-$110K (Hong Kong-based), or S$88K-S$148K / $65K-$110K (Singapore-based). These milestone bonuses are triggered by data center go-live events, sovereign cloud certification completions, and cross-border infrastructure activation milestones. A single data center go-live in mainland China or India can trigger a £20K-£35K / $26K-$45K milestone payment.

- **Sovereign Cloud Architecture Authority Premium:** The Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer serves as the sovereign cloud architecture authority for HSBC's entire APAC deployment. This authority carries a dedicated premium of £25K-£40K / $32K-$51K annually, reflecting the organizational leverage of architectural decisions that affect every application team, every business line, and every regulatory relationship in HSBC's Asia operations. In Hong Kong: HK$250K-HK$400K / $32K-$51K. In Singapore: S$43K-S$69K / $32K-$51K. This premium is reviewed annually and scales with the number of sovereign cloud zones under architectural authority.

- **Cross-Border Infrastructure Bonus Pool:** HSBC's cross-border payment and trade finance infrastructure is the bank's crown jewel -- the capability that no competitor can replicate. The Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer who designs and operates the infrastructure layer for cross-border flows (Hong Kong-Shanghai, Singapore-Mumbai, London-Hong Kong) participates in a dedicated bonus pool funded by cross-border transaction revenue. This pool yields £30K-£50K / $38K-$64K annually for infrastructure engineers, based on transaction volume growth and infrastructure reliability metrics. In Hong Kong: HK$300K-HK$500K / $38K-$64K. In Singapore: S$51K-S$86K / $38K-$64K.

- **Executive Career Trajectory:** The Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer is explicitly designed as a pipeline role for HSBC's most senior technology leadership positions: Group Head of Infrastructure (GCB 1-2, compensation £600K-£900K / $768K-$1.15M TC), Regional CTO for Asia-Pacific (GCB 2, compensation £550K-£800K / $704K-$1.02M TC), and ultimately Group CTO (GCB 0-1, compensation £800K-£1.2M+ / $1.02M-$1.54M+ TC). The median time from Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer to Regional CTO is 4-5 years, making this one of the fastest executive career paths in global banking technology. Each career step represents a £150K-£300K / $192K-$384K increase in total compensation.

#### Detailed Technical Scope

This SIGNATURE ROLE encompasses six core technical domains, each of which carries its own complexity and strategic importance:

**1. Multi-Region Kubernetes Platform**
Design, deploy, and operate Kubernetes clusters across HSBC's Asia data centers -- Hong Kong (primary), Singapore, Shanghai, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and emerging markets (Jakarta, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur). Each cluster must satisfy local regulatory requirements while maintaining global federation for workload portability. The target state is 50,000+ pods across 10+ clusters with sub-second cross-cluster communication and automatic failover. You will define the cluster architecture, networking fabric (Cilium/Calico), service mesh (Istio/Linkerd), and resource management policies for HSBC's entire Asia platform.

**2. Sovereign Cloud Architecture**
Design infrastructure architectures that comply with China's CSL/PIPL (data must remain in mainland China), Hong Kong's PDPO, Singapore's PDPA, India's DPDP Act, and emerging ASEAN data sovereignty frameworks. This requires building air-gapped or semi-connected infrastructure zones with controlled data flow between sovereign boundaries. You will work directly with HSBC's legal and compliance teams, APAC regulators, and cloud providers (AWS China/Alibaba Cloud for mainland China, AWS/Azure/GCP for other APAC markets).

**3. Cross-Border Data Fabric**
Build the infrastructure layer that enables HSBC's cross-border payment and trade finance operations. This data fabric must support real-time data replication across sovereign zones with regulatory compliance enforcement at the infrastructure layer (not the application layer). Latency targets: sub-5ms within a sovereign zone, sub-50ms cross-border (Hong Kong to Singapore), sub-200ms intercontinental (Hong Kong to London). Throughput targets: 100,000+ transactions per second per sovereign zone.

**4. GPU/AI Infrastructure for Asia**
Deploy and operate GPU clusters (NVIDIA H100/B200) for HSBC's Asia AI workloads. This includes training infrastructure for large language models (trade finance document processing), inference infrastructure for real-time fraud detection, and research infrastructure for quantitative trading. Target: 1,000+ GPUs across Hong Kong and Singapore, with sovereign GPU capacity in mainland China using domestic alternatives (Huawei Ascend/Cambricon).

**5. Observability and Reliability Engineering**
Build the observability stack (metrics, logs, traces, profiling) for HSBC's Asia infrastructure. Implement SRE practices across all sovereign zones, including automated incident response, chaos engineering for financial-grade resilience, and regulatory-grade audit logging. Target SLOs: 99.999% availability for payment infrastructure, 99.99% for all other production workloads, with regulatory-compliant incident reporting across all APAC jurisdictions.

**6. Cost Optimization and FinOps**
Manage a multi-hundred-million-dollar annual infrastructure budget across HSBC's Asia operations. Implement FinOps practices to optimize cloud and data center spend while meeting performance and regulatory requirements. You will negotiate directly with hyperscaler account teams (AWS, Azure, GCP) and data center operators (Equinix, Digital Realty, GDS Holdings) for Asia-specific pricing and capacity commitments.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Strategic Scarcity and Replacement Cost**
This role's combination of skills is extraordinarily rare. Negotiate from scarcity: *"The combination of financial-grade Kubernetes expertise, sovereign cloud architecture experience, cross-border data fabric design, and Asia-Pacific regulatory knowledge exists in fewer than 200 professionals globally. HSBC's alternative to hiring me is to assemble a team of 3-4 specialists to cover the same scope -- at a combined cost of $1.2M-$1.5M annually. I'm targeting £420K / $538K total compensation as a single point of accountability, which represents significant cost efficiency versus the alternative."*

**Lever 2 — Competing Offers from Hyperscalers and Sovereign Cloud Providers**
This profile receives offers from the most competitive employers: *"I have competing offers from AWS (Principal Solutions Architect for APAC Financial Services at $520K TC), Google Cloud (Staff Platform Architect for Asia Sovereign Cloud at $490K TC), and Alibaba Cloud (Head of Financial Services Infrastructure at $450K TC equivalent). I'm choosing HSBC because I want to build infrastructure for the bank that will define Asia's financial future -- but the offer needs to reflect the market for my skills. I'm targeting £420K-£433K / $538K-$555K total compensation."*

**Lever 3 — Dual RSU + Project Milestone Compensation**
Negotiate a five-pillar compensation structure: *"I'd like to structure my compensation as: (1) base salary of £235K / $301K, (2) standard RSU grant of £105K / $134K annualized, (3) guaranteed Year 1 bonus of £50K / $64K, (4) data center go-live milestone bonuses of £40K-£68K / $51K-$87K annually, and (5) sovereign cloud architecture authority premium of £25K-£40K / $32K-$51K. This five-pillar structure brings total Year 1 compensation to £455K-£498K / $583K-$637K, declining to £405K-£448K / $519K-$574K in Year 2+ as the guaranteed bonus converts to performance-based."*

**Lever 4 — Signing Bonus and Unvested Equity Buyout**
Candidates at this level carry substantial compensation at risk: *"I have £120K / $154K in unvested equity at my current employer, spread across the next 2.5 years. I also have a guaranteed bonus of £45K / $58K that I would forfeit. I need a signing bonus of £100K / $128K, structured as £60K / $77K at start and £40K / $51K at 12 months. This is a one-time acquisition cost that HSBC will recoup in the first quarter through infrastructure cost optimization alone."* Hong Kong: signing HK$1.00M / $128K. Singapore: S$173K / $128K.

**Lever 5 — Executive Career Path Commitment**
Lock in the executive trajectory: *"I'd like the offer letter to include a career development framework specifying: (1) eligibility for Regional CTO consideration within 4 years, (2) annual scope reviews with compensation recalibration as sovereign zones are added, (3) executive mentorship with HSBC's Group CTO or a direct report, and (4) participation in HSBC's senior leadership development program. These commitments cost HSBC nothing today but signal the bank's investment in my long-term career, which is a key factor in my decision."*

**Lever 6 — Relocation and Housing (Hong Kong / Singapore)**
For candidates relocating to Hong Kong or Singapore: *"I'm relocating from [London/Bay Area/New York] to [Hong Kong/Singapore] for this role. I require: (1) a relocation budget of £40K / $51K for moving costs, (2) a 6-month temporary housing allowance of £4K / $5K per month in Hong Kong (or S$5.5K / $4K per month in Singapore), (3) international school tuition support of £30K / $38K annually for up to 2 children, and (4) annual home-leave flights for the family. These relocation benefits are standard for senior expatriate hires at HSBC and should not be negotiated against base compensation."* Hong Kong housing: HK$40K / $5K per month. Singapore housing: S$5.5K / $4K per month.

**Lever 7 — Infrastructure Budget Authority**
Negotiate control over your infrastructure budget: *"As Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer, I'll be responsible for a multi-hundred-million-dollar infrastructure budget. I'd like formal budget authority designation with a direct reporting line to the Group Head of Infrastructure for budget decisions. This authority is essential for my effectiveness in the role and should be documented in the offer."*

**Lever 8 — Retention Equity and Long-Term Incentives**
Lock in long-term wealth creation: *"I'd like to discuss a retention RSU grant of £50K / $64K annualized, vesting over 3 years, on top of my standard RSU package. This grant should be triggered at 12 months and is contingent on my continued assignment to the Asia Infrastructure Platform. Combined with standard RSUs, this brings my total equity compensation to £155K / $198K annualized -- competitive with principal engineer equity at hyperscalers."* Hong Kong: retention RSU HK$500K / $64K. Singapore: retention RSU S$86K / $64K.

#### Negotiation Timeline and Strategy

This SIGNATURE ROLE warrants a multi-round negotiation approach:

**Round 1 — Initial Offer Receipt (Week 1)**
Receive HSBC's initial offer. Expect it to land at the 40th-50th percentile of the band: approximately £340K-£370K / $436K-$474K TC. Do not accept or reject. Respond with: *"Thank you for the offer. I'm very excited about this role and HSBC's Asia strategy. I need 5-7 business days to review the details and discuss with my family."*

**Round 2 — Counter-Offer (Week 2)**
Present your counter: *"After careful consideration, I'd like to propose the following compensation structure: [five-pillar structure from Lever 3]. My rationale is based on three factors: (1) the strategic scarcity of my profile, (2) my competing offers from [hyperscalers], and (3) the direct revenue impact of this role on HSBC's Asia infrastructure expansion. I've attached a one-page analysis comparing the total value of each offer."*

**Round 3 — Negotiation (Week 3)**
HSBC will counter at approximately 75th-85th percentile. At this stage, negotiate the non-cash components: career path commitment, relocation package, infrastructure budget authority, and retention equity. These items are easier for HSBC to approve than base salary increases and have significant long-term value.

**Round 4 — Final Agreement (Week 4)**
Close the negotiation with a comprehensive offer letter that includes: base salary, RSU grant (with vesting schedule), guaranteed Year 1 bonus, Regional Sovereign milestone bonus structure, sovereign cloud authority premium, signing bonus, relocation package, career development framework, and infrastructure budget authority. Every component should be in writing.

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** This SIGNATURE ROLE demands a SIGNATURE negotiation approach. Anchor at £420K / $538K total compensation for London -- the 85th percentile of the band. For Hong Kong, anchor at HK$4.20M / $538K; for Singapore, anchor at S$726K / $538K. Open with competing hyperscaler offers ($490K-$520K TC) and frame your choice of HSBC as mission-driven: you want to build the infrastructure for the bank that will define Asia's financial future. Deploy all eight levers sequentially across a 3-4 week negotiation timeline.
>
> **Layer 1 (Standard Comp):** Base £235K / $301K + RSU £105K / $134K + Bonus £50K / $64K = £390K / $499K.
> **Layer 2 (Regional Sovereign):** Milestone bonuses £40K-£68K / $51K-$87K + Sovereign authority premium £25K-£40K / $32K-$51K = £65K-£108K / $83K-$138K additive.
> **Layer 3 (Retention):** Retention RSU £50K / $64K annualized.
> **Effective Year 1 TC: £505K-£548K / $646K-$701K.**
>
> Your walk-away floor is £350K / $448K TC for London (base band minimum plus guaranteed Year 1 bonus), HK$3.50M / $448K for Hong Kong, S$605K / $448K for Singapore. Below this floor, the opportunity cost of accepting HSBC over a hyperscaler offer is too high to justify.
>
> If HSBC's final offer lands between your floor and anchor, negotiate the non-cash components aggressively: career path commitment to Regional CTO track, relocation package (£40K / $51K), signing bonus (£100K / $128K), and infrastructure budget authority. These components have real economic value and are typically easier for HSBC's comp committee to approve than additional cash compensation.
>
> The Asia Infrastructure Platform Engineer is the role HSBC built for the Asia Boom. You are the person HSBC needs to fill it. Negotiate accordingly.

#### Competitive Landscape — Why HSBC Wins for This Role

| Factor | HSBC | AWS/GCP/Azure | Goldman Sachs | Standard Chartered |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Asia Data Assets | 160+ years of cross-border transaction data, 20M+ Asia customers | Cloud infrastructure only, no proprietary financial data | US-centric, limited Asia presence | Smaller scale, 1/3 HSBC's assets |
| Sovereign Complexity | Operates in China, HK, SG, India, ASEAN — all with unique sovereign requirements | Provides tools but doesn't operate sovereign financial infrastructure | Minimal China presence, limited sovereign exposure | Fewer sovereign zones, less complexity |
| Infrastructure Budget | Multi-hundred-million annual budget with direct control | Working on customer infrastructure, not your own | Smaller Asia footprint, less budget per engineer | Fraction of HSBC's scale |
| Career Trajectory | Regional CTO in 4-5 years, Group CTO pipeline | Principal/Distinguished track, but operational not strategic | MD track, but engineering is support function | Smaller org, fewer senior roles |
| Compensation | $378K-$555K base TC + $83K-$138K sovereign premiums | $450K-$550K TC but no sovereign bonuses | $400K-$500K TC but NYC-centric | $280K-$380K TC, lower ceiling |
| Mission Impact | Building infrastructure for the bank that defines Asia's financial future | Selling cloud services | Supporting trading and investment banking | Following HSBC's strategy at smaller scale |

#### Asia Deployment Scenarios

**Scenario A — Hong Kong Primary (Recommended)**
Base in Hong Kong with quarterly travel to Singapore, Shanghai, and Mumbai. This is the optimal deployment for tax efficiency (15% max rate), proximity to HSBC's Asia headquarters, and access to the Hong Kong data center hub. Total compensation in Hong Kong: HK$4.33M / $555K at band maximum, with an effective tax rate of approximately 14%, yielding net income of approximately $477K. The same gross in London would net approximately $333K -- a $144K annual advantage.

**Scenario B — Singapore Primary**
Base in Singapore with regular travel across APAC. Singapore offers excellent quality of life, a thriving tech ecosystem, and favorable tax treatment (maximum 22% for top bracket). Total compensation: S$749K / $555K at band maximum, effective tax rate approximately 18%, yielding net income of approximately $455K. Singapore's position as ASEAN's financial hub provides unique access to emerging markets (Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines).

**Scenario C — London HQ with Asia Travel**
Base in London with 30-40% travel to Asia. This deployment maintains proximity to HSBC's Group headquarters and the Group CTO's office, which has advantages for career trajectory and organizational influence. However, UK tax rates (45% on income above £125K) significantly reduce net income compared to Hong Kong or Singapore. This deployment is best suited for candidates with family commitments in the UK or those prioritizing the executive career track.
