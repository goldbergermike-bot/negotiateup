#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at HSBC orchestrate the delivery of complex, multi-team technology programs that span geographies, business lines, and technology stacks. In a bank with 220,000+ employees and operations in 60+ countries, the role of a TPM extends far beyond project management -- it requires deep technical understanding, stakeholder navigation across multiple organizational hierarchies, and the ability to drive delivery in environments where a single day of delay can cost millions in lost revenue or regulatory penalties.

Under CEO Georges Elhedery's Asia-first strategy, TPMs are coordinating the largest technology investment programs in HSBC's history. The 13.1% CAGR in Asia data center infrastructure translates into dozens of concurrent infrastructure, platform, and application programs across Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, Mumbai, and Hyderabad. TPMs who can coordinate these programs across time zones, regulatory jurisdictions, and cultural contexts are extraordinarily valuable -- and HSBC's compensation structure reflects this through both standard comp and Regional Sovereign project premiums.

Candidates should emphasize their track record of delivering complex, multi-geography programs on time and within budget. HSBC values TPMs who combine technical depth (understanding the engineering challenges) with organizational influence (getting things done across a matrix organization). The scarcity of TPMs with financial services experience and Asia-Pacific program delivery credentials means that well-qualified candidates have significant negotiation leverage.

#### Asia Boom — The Regional Sovereign Premium

TPMs are the delivery engine for HSBC's Asia infrastructure expansion. The 13.1% CAGR in Asia data center markets versus 9.2% in the US translates into a continuous pipeline of new programs -- data center buildouts, cloud migrations, platform launches, regulatory compliance implementations -- each requiring dedicated TPM leadership. HSBC's position as the dominant Western bank in Asia means these programs operate under multiple regulatory frameworks, across diverse engineering cultures, and with zero margin for delivery failure.

- **Regional Sovereign Bonus for TPMs:** TPMs leading Asia infrastructure delivery programs earn additive bonuses of £17K-£30K / $22K-$38K (London-based), HK$215K-HK$380K / $28K-$49K (Hong Kong-based), or S$37K-S$66K / $28K-$49K (Singapore-based). Bonuses are structured around quarterly delivery milestones -- program launch dates, capacity activation targets, and regulatory approval milestones -- providing predictable bonus income beyond the annual performance cycle.

- **Multi-Region Coordination Premium:** TPMs who coordinate programs across 3+ APAC locations (e.g., Hong Kong + Singapore + Hyderabad + Shanghai) earn a multi-region coordination premium of £10K-£18K / $13K-$23K annually. This premium reflects the extraordinary complexity of managing stakeholders across time zones, regulatory jurisdictions, and cultural contexts. HSBC's Asia programs routinely span 4-6 countries, making this premium accessible to most Asia-facing TPMs.

- **Program Scale Escalation Bonus:** TPMs whose program scope expands during execution (measured by engineering headcount under coordination, budget managed, or number of dependent systems) receive automatic compensation reviews. A TPM who starts coordinating 30 engineers and scales to 60+ within 12 months typically receives a £12K-£20K / $15K-$26K base salary uplift plus a 15-25% increase in RSU grants.

- **Accelerated Path to Senior TPM / Director of Programs:** Asia Regional Sovereign TPMs advance to Senior TPM (GCB 4) within 2-3 years, with compensation reaching £230K-£320K / $295K-$410K TC. HSBC's Asia expansion is creating Director of Programs positions for each major APAC initiative, offering career advancement that is structurally impossible in mature, slow-growth Western banking operations.

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1 — Program Delivery Track Record**
Anchor on the scale and outcomes of programs you have delivered: *"I led a cross-regional technology program involving 45 engineers across 3 countries, delivering a $30M platform migration 2 weeks ahead of schedule and $2M under budget. HSBC's Asia infrastructure programs are similar in complexity but higher in strategic importance. I'm targeting £200K / $256K total compensation, reflecting my demonstrated ability to deliver programs at this scale."*

**Lever 2 — Asia-Pacific Program Experience**
If you have delivered programs in APAC: *"I have 4+ years of program delivery experience across Asia-Pacific, including programs spanning Hong Kong, Singapore, and India. I've navigated HKMA and MAS regulatory requirements in my delivery timelines. I'd like the multi-region coordination premium of £10K-£18K / $13K-$23K included in my compensation, as this experience is directly applicable to HSBC's Asia infrastructure programs."*

**Lever 3 — Signing Bonus and Guaranteed Bonus**
TPMs often carry significant bonus at risk when switching employers: *"My current annual bonus is £28K / $36K, which I would forfeit for a Q2 start date. I need a signing bonus of £30K / $38K and a guaranteed minimum Year 1 bonus of £25K / $32K to offset this transition cost."* Hong Kong: signing HK$300K / $38K. Singapore: signing S$51K / $38K.

**Lever 4 — Regional Sovereign Program Leadership**
Lock in the Asia program assignment: *"I'd like to be assigned as the lead TPM for [specific Asia infrastructure program], with the associated Regional Sovereign bonus of £17K-£30K / $22K-$38K. I also request the multi-region coordination premium of £10K-£18K / $13K-$23K, given that the program spans Hong Kong, Singapore, and Hyderabad. This brings my effective total compensation to £236K-£257K / $302K-$329K."*

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor at £202K / $259K total compensation for London, positioning at the 75th percentile of the TPM band. For Hong Kong, anchor at HK$2.02M / $259K; for Singapore, anchor at S$350K / $259K. Lead with your program delivery track record, emphasizing on-time/on-budget outcomes and cross-regional coordination experience. Layer the Regional Sovereign bonus (£17K-£30K / $22K-$38K) plus multi-region coordination premium (£10K-£18K / $13K-$23K) to reach £229K-£250K / $293K-$320K effective total compensation. Your walk-away floor is £172K / $220K for London, HK$1.72M / $220K for Hong Kong, S$297K / $220K for Singapore. If the offer falls short, negotiate a guaranteed Year 1 bonus of £22K-£28K / $28K-$36K, a signing bonus of £25K-£30K / $32K-$38K, and a program scale escalation clause for automatic compensation review.
