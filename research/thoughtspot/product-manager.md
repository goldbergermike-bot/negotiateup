### Product Manager | ThoughtSpot Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Equity-Backed | AI-Powered Analytics Pioneer | Liquidity Risk Premium Required

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at ThoughtSpot own the product roadmap for an AI-powered analytics platform that competes with Tableau, Looker, Power BI, and Qlik. The PM org is small and high-impact — each PM owns a significant product domain (search experience, ThoughtSpot Sage GenAI, data connectivity, enterprise administration, or embedded analytics). ThoughtSpot's differentiation is the AI-powered search experience, meaning PM decisions directly shape the competitive moat. The 10-15% bonus provides some cash stability alongside private equity.

**Level Mapping:** ThoughtSpot PM = Tableau PM = Google L5 PM = Salesforce PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Category-Defining Product Ownership:** "ThoughtSpot created the search-driven analytics category. I'm owning the roadmap for a category-defining product, not a feature within a larger platform."
2. **GenAI Product Strategy:** If owning ThoughtSpot Sage or AI features, push for AI premium: "I'm defining the GenAI analytics strategy that competes directly with Microsoft Copilot and Salesforce Einstein."
3. **Competitive Landscape Pressure:** "Tableau, Looker, Power BI, and Qlik are all adding AI features. My product decisions determine whether ThoughtSpot maintains its leadership. This is existential-level product work."
4. **Salesforce PM Counter:** Salesforce PM roles include liquid RSUs and higher base. Push ThoughtSpot equity higher to compensate for illiquidity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $190K over 4 years. I'm defining product strategy for the company's core AI analytics platform, competing against Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google. I have a Salesforce PM offer with liquid RSUs." Counter at $160K-$180K equity is competitive.
