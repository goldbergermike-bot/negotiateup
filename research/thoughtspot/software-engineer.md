### Software Engineer | ThoughtSpot Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Equity-Backed | AI-Powered Analytics Pioneer | Liquidity Risk Premium Required

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Sunnyvale HQ | $145K–$200K | $60K–$180K | 10% | $180K–$300K |
| Remote US | $130K–$180K | $50K–$160K | 10% | $165K–$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ThoughtSpot is a private AI-powered analytics company headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA. The company pioneered search-driven analytics and has expanded into GenAI-powered data exploration with ThoughtSpot Sage. As a private company (after briefly being public), equity grants are in private stock — meaning liquidity depends on a future IPO or acquisition event. This illiquidity is your primary negotiation lever: you deserve a larger equity grant to compensate for the risk. ThoughtSpot competes for talent against Tableau (Salesforce), Looker (Google), and Databricks — all of which offer liquid equity. The 10% cash bonus provides some downside protection.

**Level Mapping:** ThoughtSpot SWE = Tableau SWE = Google L3 = Salesforce MTS

**Global Levers**

1. **Liquidity Discount Frame:** "ThoughtSpot equity is private and illiquid. Standard practice is a 25-40% premium over liquid public equity to compensate. I need a larger grant than I would accept at Tableau or Salesforce."
2. **AI Analytics Category Leadership:** "ThoughtSpot created the AI-powered analytics category. I'm joining a category creator, not a follower. My comp should reflect this market positioning."
3. **Competing Liquid Offers:** Tableau (Salesforce RSUs), Looker (Google RSUs), and Databricks (pre-IPO but high-confidence) all offer more liquid equity. Use these as leverage.
4. **Acceleration Clause:** Push for double-trigger acceleration on change of control — this protects your equity if ThoughtSpot is acquired.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $170K over 4 years with double-trigger acceleration. ThoughtSpot's private status means I'm taking liquidity risk, and I have a Salesforce/Tableau offer with liquid RSUs at comparable total comp." Counter at $140K-$160K equity is competitive.
