### Engineering Manager | ThoughtSpot Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Equity-Backed | AI-Powered Analytics Pioneer | Liquidity Risk Premium Required

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Sunnyvale HQ | $200K–$255K | $140K–$300K | 10-15% | $290K–$430K |
| Remote US | $185K–$240K | $120K–$270K | 10-15% | $270K–$400K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at ThoughtSpot lead teams building the AI-powered analytics platform. The company is mid-size, meaning EMs have significant organizational impact — each team's work is visible to leadership and directly affects product direction. ThoughtSpot's AI pivot (ThoughtSpot Sage, GenAI search) has created new teams that need experienced EMs. The private equity structure means EM equity grants are especially important to negotiate aggressively — you need both a large initial grant and an acceleration clause to protect against liquidity timing risk.

**Level Mapping:** ThoughtSpot EM = Tableau EM = Google L5 Manager = Salesforce EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Organizational Impact at Scale:** "ThoughtSpot is small enough that my team's output directly moves product metrics. At Salesforce, an EM manages one feature team among hundreds. Here, I'm managing a team that shapes the entire product."
2. **AI Team Building Premium:** If building a new AI/GenAI team, push for a premium: "I'm not inheriting a team — I'm building one from scratch for the company's AI transformation. Team building carries more risk and more impact."
3. **IC Parity Requirement:** Staff engineers can earn $300K+ in equity. EMs must match or exceed: "My equity must be at least equal to the Staff ICs on my team."
4. **Retention Competition:** ThoughtSpot engineers are targeted by Salesforce, Databricks, and Snowflake. Frame: "Retaining my team against public-company offers is a core deliverable. My comp needs to reflect that I'm the retention lever."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $280K over 4 years with double-trigger acceleration. I'm managing a team at ThoughtSpot's AI transformation inflection point, and I need comp that exceeds my Staff ICs. I'm evaluating EM roles at Salesforce and Databricks with liquid equity." Counter at $230K-$260K equity is competitive with acceleration terms.
