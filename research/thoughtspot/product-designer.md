**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at ThoughtSpot design the user experience for an AI-powered analytics platform. The core design challenge is making complex data exploration feel as simple as a Google search — this is one of the hardest UX problems in enterprise software. ThoughtSpot Sage adds GenAI conversational interfaces, requiring designers who can create natural language interaction patterns for data exploration. The design team is small, meaning each designer owns significant product surface area. [Source: ThoughtSpot Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** ThoughtSpot Senior Designer = Tableau Senior Designer = Salesforce Senior Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Search UX = Product Differentiator:** "ThoughtSpot's entire value proposition is making data analysis as easy as search. The UX IS the product differentiator. My design work directly determines whether customers adopt ThoughtSpot or stick with Tableau."
2. **GenAI Interaction Design:** "Designing conversational AI interfaces for enterprise data is a nascent field. My GenAI interaction design skills are in extremely high demand."
3. **Small Team, Big Impact:** "The design team at ThoughtSpot is small enough that I'll own entire product surfaces. At Salesforce I'd own one feature within one product."
4. **Salesforce/Figma Counter:** Use offers from companies with liquid equity to push ThoughtSpot equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $145K over 4 years. I'm designing the UX that is ThoughtSpot's core differentiator, and I have a Salesforce offer with liquid RSUs." Counter at $120K-$140K equity is competitive.
