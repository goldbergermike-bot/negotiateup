### Senior Software Engineer | ThoughtSpot Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Equity-Backed | AI-Powered Analytics Pioneer | Liquidity Risk Premium Required

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Sunnyvale HQ | $170K–$225K | $100K–$220K | 10% | $225K–$350K |
| Remote US | $155K–$210K | $85K–$200K | 10% | $210K–$325K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at ThoughtSpot own major subsystems of the AI-powered analytics platform — the search engine, query optimizer, visualization layer, or ThoughtSpot Sage GenAI features. The company is relatively small compared to Salesforce/Tableau, meaning each senior engineer has outsized architectural influence. ThoughtSpot's private equity requires a liquidity premium. At the senior level, the equity grant is the primary negotiation lever — push hard here because refresh grants at private companies tend to be less predictable than at public companies.

**Level Mapping:** ThoughtSpot Senior SWE = Tableau Senior SWE = Google L4 = Salesforce LMTS

**Global Levers**

1. **Architectural Ownership:** "As a senior engineer at a company ThoughtSpot's size, I'll own entire subsystems. At Salesforce I'd own a feature within a subsystem. The scope differential justifies top-of-band comp."
2. **Private Equity Premium:** "I need a 30-40% equity premium over equivalent liquid offers to compensate for illiquidity. My Tableau offer has liquid Salesforce RSUs — ThoughtSpot's grant needs to be meaningfully higher."
3. **GenAI Search Skills Scarcity:** If working on ThoughtSpot Sage or the NLP query engine, push for AI premium: "Building production GenAI search over enterprise data is extremely rare expertise."
4. **Acceleration Protection:** Push for double-trigger acceleration and an extended post-termination exercise period (90 days minimum, ideally 1 year).

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $200K over 4 years with double-trigger acceleration. I'm owning core platform architecture at a company where each senior engineer has 3-5x the scope of a similar role at Salesforce." Counter at $170K-$190K equity is strong.
