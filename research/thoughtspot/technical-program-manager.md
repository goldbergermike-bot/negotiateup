**Negotiation DNA**

TPMs at ThoughtSpot coordinate cross-functional engineering programs across a mid-size engineering organization. At ThoughtSpot's scale, TPMs have significant influence — each TPM manages programs that touch a large percentage of the engineering org. Key programs include the AI platform migration (ThoughtSpot Sage), cloud infrastructure optimization, data connectivity expansions, and enterprise security compliance. The private equity structure creates the standard liquidity premium negotiation dynamic. [Source: ThoughtSpot TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** ThoughtSpot Senior TPM = Tableau Senior TPM = Google L5 TPM = Salesforce Senior TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Functional Scope:** "At ThoughtSpot's size, my programs touch 30-50% of the engineering organization. At Salesforce, a TPM at this level manages one workstream within one cloud. The scope is fundamentally different."
2. **AI Platform Transition:** If managing the ThoughtSpot Sage or AI platform programs, push for premium: "I'm managing the most complex technical program at the company — the AI platform transformation."
3. **Enterprise Compliance Programs:** If managing SOC2, FedRAMP, or data governance programs, frame as: "Enterprise compliance is a revenue enabler — without these certifications, ThoughtSpot can't sell to regulated industries."
4. **Salesforce/Google TPM Counter:** Both offer liquid equity and higher base. Push ThoughtSpot equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $165K over 4 years. My programs span the majority of ThoughtSpot's engineering organization, and I have TPM offers from Salesforce and Google with liquid RSUs." Counter at $135K-$155K equity is competitive.
