### ML / AI Engineer | ThoughtSpot Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Equity-Backed | AI-Powered Analytics Pioneer | **+15–25% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Sunnyvale HQ | $165K–$225K | $80K–$210K | 10% | $210K–$345K |
| Remote US | $150K–$210K | $70K–$190K | 10% | $195K–$320K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at ThoughtSpot build the machine learning infrastructure that powers the platform's core intelligence. This includes the NLP models for natural language query understanding, recommendation systems for insight surfacing, anomaly detection algorithms, and the GenAI integration powering ThoughtSpot Sage. ThoughtSpot's entire value proposition is AI-powered analytics — making ML/AI engineers directly responsible for the company's competitive moat. The AI premium (15-25% above standard SWE) is justified because this role IS the product differentiation. [Source: ThoughtSpot ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** ThoughtSpot ML/AI Eng = Tableau ML Eng = Databricks ML Eng = Google L4 ML

**Global Levers**

1. **Product = AI Frame:** "At most companies, ML is a supporting function. At ThoughtSpot, ML IS the product. My NLP models and recommendation algorithms are the reason customers choose ThoughtSpot. This justifies AI-premium compensation."
2. **GenAI Competition:** "Microsoft Copilot, Salesforce Einstein, and Google Duet AI are all investing billions in GenAI analytics. ThoughtSpot needs top ML talent to compete. The talent market for production GenAI engineers is extremely tight."
3. **NLP-to-SQL Production Expertise:** "Building production NLP-to-SQL systems at enterprise scale is one of the rarest ML specializations. This isn't research — it's production ML serving millions of queries."
4. **Liquid Equity Competitors:** Google, Meta, and Salesforce all recruit aggressively for ML engineers with liquid RSUs. Push ThoughtSpot equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $330K total comp with equity at $200K over 4 years. ML/AI engineering IS ThoughtSpot's product — I'm building the competitive moat. I have competing offers from Google and Salesforce with liquid RSUs and AI premiums." Counter at $170K-$190K equity is strong.
