### Data Engineer | ThoughtSpot Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Equity-Backed | AI-Powered Analytics Pioneer | Liquidity Risk Premium Required

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Sunnyvale HQ | $155K–$210K | $70K–$190K | 10% | $195K–$320K |
| Remote US | $140K–$195K | $60K–$170K | 10% | $180K–$295K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at ThoughtSpot build the data infrastructure that powers the AI-powered analytics platform. This includes the connectors to cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks), the data caching and indexing layer that enables sub-second search queries, and the data pipelines that feed ThoughtSpot Sage's GenAI features. There's a meta-quality to this role: you're a data engineer building a platform that empowers other data teams. ThoughtSpot's private equity requires the standard liquidity premium negotiation.

**Level Mapping:** ThoughtSpot Senior DE = Tableau Senior DE = Snowflake DE = Google L4 DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Meta-Platform Frame:** "I'm a data engineer building the analytics platform that other data engineers use. The standard of data engineering at ThoughtSpot is inherently higher because we're our own showcase."
2. **Cloud Warehouse Connectivity:** ThoughtSpot connects to every major cloud data warehouse. If you have multi-cloud data engineering experience, push for a premium: "I have production experience with Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks — the three platforms ThoughtSpot must integrate with flawlessly."
3. **Search Index Performance:** ThoughtSpot's sub-second search requires sophisticated data indexing. Push for a premium if working on the indexing layer.
4. **Snowflake/Databricks DE Counter:** Both companies pay higher base and offer more liquid equity. Use to push ThoughtSpot equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $180K over 4 years. I'm building the data infrastructure for an AI-powered analytics platform, and I have competing offers from Snowflake and Databricks with either liquid RSUs or higher-confidence pre-IPO equity." Counter at $150K-$170K equity is competitive.
