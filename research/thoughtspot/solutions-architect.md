**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at ThoughtSpot design and implement analytics deployments for enterprise customers. SAs bridge the gap between ThoughtSpot's AI-powered platform and customer data infrastructure — connecting to Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and Databricks environments while configuring the search-driven analytics experience for specific business domains. The role is highly technical, requiring deep knowledge of cloud data warehouses, data modeling, and increasingly, GenAI configuration for ThoughtSpot Sage deployments. SAs directly influence customer adoption and expansion revenue. [Source: ThoughtSpot SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** ThoughtSpot Senior SA = Tableau Senior SA = Snowflake SA = Databricks SA

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue Influence:** "My architecture recommendations directly impact customer adoption and expansion. A well-designed ThoughtSpot deployment drives 2-3x higher user adoption than a poorly architected one."
2. **Multi-Platform Expertise:** "I architect ThoughtSpot deployments on top of Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and Databricks. This multi-platform data warehouse expertise is rare and directly valuable."
3. **GenAI Deployment:** If deploying ThoughtSpot Sage for enterprise customers, push for premium: "I'm configuring enterprise GenAI analytics — a deployment pattern that barely existed 18 months ago."
4. **Snowflake/Databricks SA Counter:** Both companies pay SAs well with liquid equity. Use as leverage.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $155K over 4 years. My multi-platform data architecture expertise drives customer adoption and retention, and I have SA offers from Snowflake and Databricks with more liquid equity." Counter at $125K-$145K equity is acceptable.
