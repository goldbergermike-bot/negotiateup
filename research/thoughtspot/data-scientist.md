**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at ThoughtSpot work on the AI models that power the search-driven analytics experience. This includes the NLP models that translate natural language queries into SQL, the recommendation algorithms that surface relevant insights, anomaly detection models, and the GenAI features in ThoughtSpot Sage. The company's core differentiator is AI-powered analytics, making data scientists central to the product vision. Private equity compensation structure applies.

**Level Mapping:** ThoughtSpot Senior DS = Tableau Senior DS = Google L4 DS = Meta IC4 DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Core Product Contribution:** "At ThoughtSpot, data science IS the product. My NLP and ML models are the reason customers choose ThoughtSpot over Tableau or Looker. This isn't an internal analytics role — it's a product engineering role."
2. **NLP/Search Expertise Scarcity:** "Building production NLP systems that translate natural language to SQL at enterprise scale is extremely rare. This is not prompt engineering — it's production ML."
3. **GenAI Integration:** If working on ThoughtSpot Sage, push for AI premium: "I'm building GenAI features that directly compete with Microsoft Copilot and Salesforce Einstein."
4. **Liquid Equity Alternatives:** Google, Meta, and Salesforce all offer liquid RSUs for DS roles. Use to push ThoughtSpot equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $185K over 4 years. My NLP and ML expertise directly powers ThoughtSpot's core product differentiation, and I have offers from companies with liquid equity." Counter at $155K-$175K equity is strong.
