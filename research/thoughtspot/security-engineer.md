### Security Engineer | ThoughtSpot Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private Equity-Backed | AI-Powered Analytics Pioneer | Liquidity Risk Premium Required

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Sunnyvale HQ | $160K–$215K | $70K–$195K | 10% | $200K–$325K |
| Remote US | $145K–$200K | $60K–$175K | 10% | $185K–$300K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at ThoughtSpot protect an analytics platform that connects to enterprise customers' most sensitive data — financial databases, customer records, and strategic business metrics. ThoughtSpot connects directly to cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), meaning the security boundary extends across customer data infrastructure. The addition of GenAI features (ThoughtSpot Sage) introduces new attack vectors including prompt injection, data exfiltration via natural language queries, and model poisoning. Security is foundational to enterprise trust. [Source: ThoughtSpot Security Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** ThoughtSpot Senior Security Eng = Tableau Senior Security Eng = Salesforce Security Eng

**Global Levers**

1. **Customer Data Trust:** "ThoughtSpot connects directly to enterprise data warehouses containing the most sensitive business data. My security work is the foundation of customer trust that enables revenue."
2. **GenAI Security Surface:** "ThoughtSpot Sage introduces GenAI attack vectors — prompt injection, data exfiltration through natural language queries, and unauthorized data access through AI-generated SQL. I bring AI security expertise to a novel threat surface."
3. **Multi-Cloud Security Complexity:** "Securing analytics across AWS, GCP, and Azure with direct connections to Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift is significantly more complex than single-cloud security."
4. **Cybersecurity Market Leverage:** CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Zscaler all offer liquid equity and higher base. Push ThoughtSpot equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $185K over 4 years. I'm securing the platform that connects to enterprise customers' most sensitive data, and I have competing offers from cybersecurity companies with liquid equity and cash bonuses." Counter at $155K-$175K equity is competitive.
