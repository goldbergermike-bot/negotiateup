**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at ThoughtSpot manage the cloud infrastructure that runs a real-time analytics platform serving enterprise customers. ThoughtSpot runs on major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) and offers both SaaS and customer-managed deployments. The platform's sub-second search query requirement creates demanding infrastructure performance standards. DevOps engineers must ensure high availability, low latency, and efficient resource utilization across multi-cloud environments. Private equity compensation dynamics apply.

**Level Mapping:** ThoughtSpot Senior DevOps = Tableau Senior DevOps = Datadog DevOps = Google L4 SRE

**Global Levers**

1. **Real-Time Performance SLA:** "ThoughtSpot promises sub-second search analytics. My infrastructure work directly enables the product's core promise. A 100ms degradation is a product failure, not just an ops issue."
2. **Multi-Cloud Complexity:** "Running a real-time analytics platform across AWS, GCP, and Azure requires multi-cloud expertise that most DevOps engineers don't have."
3. **SaaS + On-Prem Hybrid:** ThoughtSpot supports both SaaS and customer-managed deployments. This dual-mode infrastructure is significantly more complex than pure SaaS.
4. **Cloud-Native Competing Offers:** Datadog, HashiCorp, and cloud providers offer liquid equity or higher base. Use as leverage.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $165K over 4 years. I'm managing multi-cloud infrastructure for a real-time analytics platform with sub-second SLA requirements, and I have offers from companies with liquid equity." Counter at $135K-$155K equity is acceptable.
