**The Entertainment Technology Architecture Premium**

Sony's unique position spanning gaming hardware (PS5), platform services (PSN), and entertainment content (Sony Pictures, Sony Music) means Staff engineers can define architecture that bridges technology and entertainment in ways no other company offers.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG L6 Offer:** "I have an L6 offer from [Google/Meta/Microsoft] at $[X] TC."
2. **Platform Architecture Scope:** "My architectural decisions span PlayStation's 100M+ user platform -- L6-equivalent scope."
3. **Cross-Division Impact:** "My work impacts PlayStation, entertainment, and semiconductor divisions simultaneously."
4. **Sign-On + Refresher:** "I need a $[60K-90K] sign-on and documented refresher expectations."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Defining Sony's PlayStation architecture at Staff level is compelling. I have a competing L6 offer at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+80K] and a $70K sign-on. TC should reach $[target]."
