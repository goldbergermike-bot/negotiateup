**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Sony (IC4-IC5) lead critical technical initiatives across the company's diverse portfolio. At SIE, seniors architect PlayStation Network services, optimize PS5 system software, and build cloud gaming infrastructure. In other Sony divisions, seniors develop entertainment streaming platforms, image sensor software, or AI for content creation. Compensation at the senior level has improved substantially as Sony competes with Microsoft, Google, and Apple for experienced engineers.

**The Hardware-Software Integration Premium**

Sony's products require deep hardware-software integration: PS5 system software, image sensor firmware, camera processing pipelines. Senior engineers who can bridge hardware and software constraints are scarce and valuable.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG/Gaming Senior Offer:** "I have a senior offer from [Microsoft/Google/Apple] at $[X] TC."
2. **Platform Architecture:** "My [console platform/game services/cloud gaming] experience directly improves PlayStation's competitive position."
3. **Hardware-Software Expertise:** "My ability to optimize software for custom hardware (PS5 silicon, image sensors) is rare."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[35K-50K] sign-on offsets my unvested equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Sony's hardware-software integration challenges are unique. I have a competing senior offer from [Microsoft/Google] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+50K] and a $40K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
