**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Sony (IC4-IC5) lead critical technical initiatives across the company's diverse portfolio. At SIE, seniors architect PlayStation Network services, optimize PS5 system software, and build cloud gaming infrastructure. In other Sony divisions, seniors develop entertainment streaming platforms, image sensor software, or AI for content creation. Compensation at the senior level has improved substantially as Sony competes with Microsoft, Google, and Apple for experienced engineers.
