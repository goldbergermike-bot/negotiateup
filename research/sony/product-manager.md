**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Sony own products spanning PlayStation platform services (PS Store, PS Plus subscriptions, social features, cloud gaming), entertainment platforms (Crunchyroll, Sony's anime streaming service with 15M+ subscribers), and semiconductor products (image sensor applications). US PMs at SIE define strategy for PlayStation's services business, which now generates more revenue than hardware.

**Level Mapping:** PM at Sony (IC4-IC5) = L5-L6 PM at Google, IC5-IC6 PM at Meta, Sr PM at Microsoft Xbox

**The Services Revenue PM Premium**

PlayStation's transition from hardware to services revenue makes PM roles increasingly strategic. PMs who can optimize PlayStation Plus subscriber growth, PS Store conversion, and digital content monetization directly impact Sony's highest-margin revenue stream.
