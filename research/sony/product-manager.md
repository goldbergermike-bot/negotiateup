### Product Manager | Sony Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $110B market cap with PM opportunities across PlayStation (100M+ PSN users), entertainment platforms (Crunchyroll, Sony LIV), and semiconductor products + US PM comp competitive with gaming industry + Sony stock RSUs | Sony PMs define product strategy at the intersection of technology and entertainment | **ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCT PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Mateo / San Diego (US) | $145K–$210K | $50K–$155K | 10–15% | $190K–$315K |
| Bay Area (US) | $140K–$205K | $45K–$145K | 10–15% | $180K–$305K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Sony own products spanning PlayStation platform services (PS Store, PS Plus subscriptions, social features, cloud gaming), entertainment platforms (Crunchyroll, Sony's anime streaming service with 15M+ subscribers), and semiconductor products (image sensor applications). US PMs at SIE define strategy for PlayStation's services business, which now generates more revenue than hardware.

**Level Mapping:** PM at Sony (IC4-IC5) = L5-L6 PM at Google, IC5-IC6 PM at Meta, Sr PM at Microsoft Xbox

**The Services Revenue PM Premium**

PlayStation's transition from hardware to services revenue makes PM roles increasingly strategic. PMs who can optimize PlayStation Plus subscriber growth, PS Store conversion, and digital content monetization directly impact Sony's highest-margin revenue stream.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG/Gaming PM Offer:** "I have a PM offer from [Microsoft/Google/Meta] at $[X] TC."
2. **Gaming Platform PM:** "My gaming platform/subscription PM experience directly drives PlayStation Plus growth."
3. **Entertainment PM:** "My streaming/content PM expertise applies to Crunchyroll and Sony's entertainment platforms."
4. **Services Revenue:** "The products I'd own directly impact PlayStation's services revenue -- Sony's highest-growth segment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Defining PlayStation's services strategy is compelling. I have a competing PM offer at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+45K] and a $35K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
