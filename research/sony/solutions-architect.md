**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Sony design end-to-end technical architectures across the company's uniquely diverse portfolio. At SIE, SAs architect PlayStation Network services (100M+ users), cloud gaming infrastructure for PS Plus Premium, and developer platform integrations. Across other divisions, SAs design systems connecting Sony Pictures' content pipelines, Sony Music's streaming distribution, and Sony Semiconductor's image sensor platforms. The role demands rare breadth -- bridging gaming, entertainment, cloud, and hardware domains -- making experienced SAs highly sought after as Sony accelerates its cross-division technology strategy.

**Level Mapping:** Solutions Architect at Sony (IC5-IC6) = L5-L6 SA at Google Cloud, Senior SA at AWS, Principal TE at Microsoft, Senior Architect at EA/Epic

**The Cross-Division Systems Architecture Premium**

Sony's conglomerate structure creates architecture challenges that few companies can match. SAs must design systems that serve PlayStation's real-time gaming workloads, Sony Pictures' content delivery pipelines, and Sony Semiconductor's IoT platforms -- often with shared infrastructure. Architects who can unify these domains reduce duplication and accelerate Sony's "One Sony" technology strategy, making them disproportionately valuable.
