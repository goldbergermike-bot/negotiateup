**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Sony coordinate some of the entertainment industry's most complex cross-functional programs. At SIE, TPMs drive PlayStation console launch programs (hardware, firmware, developer tools, online services), PS Plus feature rollouts, and cloud gaming expansion. TPMs also manage cross-division initiatives connecting PlayStation, Sony Pictures, and Sony Music -- such as integrating Crunchyroll into PlayStation platforms or coordinating entertainment bundles. The role requires navigating Sony's matrix organization across US, Japan, and European teams with different working cultures.

**Level Mapping:** TPM at Sony (IC4-IC5) = L5-L6 TPM at Google, IC5-IC6 TPM at Meta, Sr TPM at Amazon, Senior TPM at Microsoft Xbox

**The Console Launch Program Premium**

PlayStation console launches (PS5, PS5 Pro, future hardware) are multi-billion-dollar programs spanning custom silicon, system software, manufacturing, developer relations, and global marketing -- coordinated across San Mateo, Tokyo, and worldwide studios. TPMs who can orchestrate these cross-continental, cross-functional programs develop program management skills that are unmatched outside of major hardware companies.
