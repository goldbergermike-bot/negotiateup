**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Sony coordinate some of the entertainment industry's most complex cross-functional programs. At SIE, TPMs drive PlayStation console launch programs (hardware, firmware, developer tools, online services), PS Plus feature rollouts, and cloud gaming expansion. TPMs also manage cross-division initiatives connecting PlayStation, Sony Pictures, and Sony Music -- such as integrating Crunchyroll into PlayStation platforms or coordinating entertainment bundles. The role requires navigating Sony's matrix organization across US, Japan, and European teams with different working cultures.

**Level Mapping:** TPM at Sony (IC4-IC5) = L5-L6 TPM at Google, IC5-IC6 TPM at Meta, Sr TPM at Amazon, Senior TPM at Microsoft Xbox

**The Console Launch Program Premium**

PlayStation console launches (PS5, PS5 Pro, future hardware) are multi-billion-dollar programs spanning custom silicon, system software, manufacturing, developer relations, and global marketing -- coordinated across San Mateo, Tokyo, and worldwide studios. TPMs who can orchestrate these cross-continental, cross-functional programs develop program management skills that are unmatched outside of major hardware companies.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG/Gaming TPM Offer:** "I have a TPM offer from [Google/Amazon/Microsoft] at $[X] TC."
2. **Console/Hardware Launch:** "My hardware product launch experience directly supports PlayStation's next-generation program execution."
3. **Cross-Cultural Program Management:** "My experience managing programs across US and Japan teams aligns with Sony's global coordination needs."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[35K-50K] sign-on offsets my unvested equity at my current company."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Driving PlayStation's cross-functional programs across San Mateo and Tokyo is compelling. I have a competing TPM offer from [Google/Amazon] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+45K] and a $40K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
