**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Sony protect one of the entertainment industry's most valuable ecosystems. PlayStation's anti-piracy systems protect billions in digital game sales, anti-cheat systems maintain competitive integrity for online gaming, and PSN account security protects 100M+ users. Sony Pictures' 2014 breach remains a watershed moment that permanently elevated cybersecurity investment across Sony's divisions. The company also protects proprietary semiconductor IP, unreleased entertainment content, and sensitive studio data.

Sony's security challenges are unique: anti-piracy (protecting PS5 from jailbreaking and game piracy), anti-cheat (maintaining competitive integrity across online games), entertainment IP protection (preventing leaks of unreleased games, movies, music), and corporate security (post-2014 breach vigilance). This breadth of security domains creates versatile security practitioners.
