**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Sony manage infrastructure supporting PlayStation Network (100M+ MAU), cloud gaming (PS Plus Premium game streaming), and entertainment platforms. PSN must handle extreme traffic spikes during major game launches (a AAA title launch can generate millions of simultaneous downloads and matchmaking requests) and maintain near-zero downtime for online gaming services.

**Level Mapping:** DevOps Engineer at Sony (IC2-IC4) = L3-L5 SRE at Google, IC3-IC5 PE at Meta, SysDE at Amazon

**The Game Launch Scaling Premium**

Major PlayStation game launches (God of War, Spider-Man, The Last of Us) create traffic spikes that require careful infrastructure planning and auto-scaling. DevOps engineers who can manage these events develop high-pressure infrastructure skills.
