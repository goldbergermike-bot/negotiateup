**Negotiation DNA**

Sony Corporation is one of the world's most diversified technology and entertainment companies, spanning PlayStation (gaming), Sony Pictures (film/TV), Sony Music, Sony Semiconductor Solutions (image sensors), and Sony Electronics (cameras, audio). Software Engineers at Sony work across a remarkably diverse portfolio: PlayStation platform services, game engine technology, entertainment streaming platforms (Crunchyroll, Sony LIV), image sensor firmware, camera software, and AI/ML for content creation.

Sony's US compensation (primarily through Sony Interactive Entertainment for gaming roles) is competitive within the gaming industry but typically trails FAANG by 10-20%. The company has been increasing compensation since 2022, recognizing the need to compete with Microsoft, Google, and Apple for engineering talent. RSU grants are in Sony stock (NYSE: SONY), which has shown strong performance. In Japan, Sony's compensation structure includes base salary, biannual bonuses (typically 4-6 months), and stock options, making total comp more competitive than base salary alone suggests.

**Level Mapping:** Software Engineer at Sony (IC2-IC4) = L3-L4 at Google, IC3-IC4 at Meta, SDE I-II at Amazon

**The Sony Portfolio Premium**

Sony's unique position at the intersection of technology and entertainment creates engineering roles that blend hardware, software, and content in ways no other company can. Engineers might optimize PS5 system software, build ML models for Sony Pictures visual effects, or develop firmware for Sony's industry-leading image sensors. This breadth creates unusually versatile engineers.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG/Gaming Offer:** "I have an offer from [Microsoft/Google/Apple] at $[X] TC. Sony's product diversity is compelling, but I need competitive comp."
2. **PlayStation Passion:** "I'm passionate about PlayStation and gaming technology, but the compensation gap with [competitor] is $[Y]. Can we close this with an increased RSU grant?"
3. **Entertainment Tech Expertise:** "My [streaming/content tech/media engineering] experience applies to Sony's entertainment platforms."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A $[25K-40K] sign-on offsets my unvested equity and reflects the competitive market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Sony's product diversity is unique. I have a competing offer from [Microsoft/Google] at $[W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at $[Y+40K] and a $30K sign-on, bringing TC to $[target]."
