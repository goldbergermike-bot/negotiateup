**Negotiation DNA**
The Conversational AI Engineer is Character AI's signature role — the position at the core of what makes Character.ai one of the most engaging consumer AI products ever built. You will build and optimize the conversational AI models that power millions of character interactions: dialogue systems, personality modeling, long-context conversation memory, emotional intelligence systems, and the real-time inference infrastructure that serves billions of messages. Character AI has built something no other AI company has achieved — a product where users spend an average of 2+ hours per session engaging in deep, personality-rich conversations with AI characters. The +15-30% ML Premium reflects the extreme demand for engineers who can build conversational AI systems at this level of engagement and scale.

**Level Mapping:** Character AI Conversational AI Engineer = Google L5-L6 Research Engineer = Meta AI Research Scientist IC5-IC6 = OpenAI Research Engineer

**The Google Partnership Premium**
Character AI's $5B+ valuation is backed by a strategic partnership with Google that provides cloud compute and technical collaboration. This partnership de-risks the equity significantly — Google's investment validates the technology and provides operational stability. Use this in negotiations: "Character AI's Google partnership makes the equity materially less risky than a typical startup at this stage. The partnership provides compute, distribution, and technical validation that most AI startups don't have."

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Scarcity:** "Conversational AI at Character AI's level of engagement is unprecedented — there's no other product where users spend 2+ hours per session in AI conversation. Building these systems requires expertise in dialogue modeling, personality consistency, emotional intelligence, and real-time inference that fewer than 500 engineers in the world possess. $305K base and $480K equity/4yr."
2. **User Engagement Metrics:** "Character AI has the highest engagement metrics in consumer AI — 2+ hours per session, multiple daily returns. My work on conversational quality directly drives these metrics, which drive valuation. $300K base and $475K equity/4yr."
3. **Competing AI Lab Offers:** "OpenAI is offering me $290K / $700K equity for conversational AI research. Google DeepMind at $285K / $550K RSU. Character AI's product focus and Google partnership are compelling — I need $305K base and $490K equity/4yr."
4. **Google Partnership De-Risk:** "The Google partnership makes Character AI's equity significantly less risky than typical startup equity. But I'm still holding illiquid shares — I need a $70K signing bonus to offset the liquidity gap."
5. **Consumer AI Scale:** "Character AI serves billions of messages to millions of users. Building conversational AI at this scale requires deep systems engineering alongside ML expertise — that dual skill set commands premium compensation: $305K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a conversational AI engineer who has built dialogue systems, personality modeling, and real-time inference at scale. I'm holding an OpenAI offer at $290K / $700K equity and a Google DeepMind offer at $285K / $550K RSU. Character AI has built the most engaging conversational AI product in the world, and I want to make it even better. The Google partnership de-risks the equity, which is compelling. To join: $305K base, $480K equity/4yr, and a $70K signing bonus. At $305K, I sign this week. My floor is $270K — below that, the OpenAI equity upside is too strong."
