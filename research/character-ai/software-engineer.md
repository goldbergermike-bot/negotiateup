### Software Engineer | Character AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Top-Tier AI Comp + Pre-IPO Equity | $5B+ Valuation (Google Partnership) | Menlo Park | Consumer AI Scale

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Menlo Park / Bay Area | $170K-$240K | $120K-$350K | — | $200K-$328K |
| New York City | $170K-$240K | $120K-$350K | — | $200K-$328K |
| Remote US | $153K-$216K | $108K-$315K | — | $180K-$295K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Software Engineers at Character AI build the product platform that powers one of the most engaging consumer AI applications ever created — the character creation tools, the conversation interface, the social features, the API platform, and the backend systems serving billions of messages. Character AI has achieved unprecedented user engagement (2+ hours per session), and SWEs build the product experiences that drive that engagement. The Menlo Park location puts you in the heart of Silicon Valley's AI ecosystem.

**Level Mapping:** Character AI SWE = Google L3-L4 = Meta E3-E4 = Startup Senior SWE (impact)

**The Google Partnership Premium**
Character AI's Google partnership provides compute, distribution, and technical validation. This makes the equity significantly less risky than typical startup equity at this valuation.

**Global Levers**
1. **Consumer AI Scale:** "Character AI processes billions of messages for millions of users. Building at this scale requires production engineering excellence — $235K base and $340K equity/4yr."
2. **User Engagement Impact:** "My product work directly drives the engagement metrics that define Character AI's value — 2+ hour sessions, daily returns. That engagement impact: $230K base."
3. **Competing Offers:** "I have a Google offer at $195K / $250K RSU and a Meta offer at $190K / $280K RSU. Character AI's product and Google partnership are compelling, but I need $235K base and $340K equity/4yr."
4. **Equity De-Risk:** "The Google partnership de-risks Character AI's equity — but it's still illiquid. $230K base and a $35K signing bonus to offset the liquidity gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a software engineer excited about building consumer AI at massive scale. Holding Google at $195K / $250K RSU and Meta at $190K / $280K RSU. Character AI's product engagement is unmatched, and the Google partnership makes the equity compelling. To join: $235K base, $335K equity/4yr, and a $35K signing bonus. Floor is $200K."
