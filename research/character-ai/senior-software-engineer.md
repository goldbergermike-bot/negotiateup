### Senior Software Engineer | Character AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Top-Tier AI Comp + Pre-IPO Equity | $5B+ Valuation (Google Partnership) | Menlo Park | Consumer AI at Scale

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Menlo Park / Bay Area | $200K-$270K | $160K-$420K | — | $240K-$375K |
| New York City | $200K-$270K | $160K-$420K | — | $240K-$375K |
| Remote US | $180K-$243K | $144K-$378K | — | $216K-$338K |

**Negotiation DNA**
Senior Software Engineers at Character AI own critical systems powering the most engaging consumer AI product in the world. At Character AI's scale (billions of messages, millions of users), senior SWEs architect the real-time conversation infrastructure, the character creation platform, the social features, and the backend systems that must handle massive throughput with sub-second latency. The Google partnership provides infrastructure advantages, but senior engineers must still solve novel scaling challenges unique to conversational AI.

**Level Mapping:** Character AI Senior SWE = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Startup Staff SWE (impact)

**The Google Partnership Premium**
Use the Google partnership to frame equity conversations: "Google's investment validates Character AI's technology and de-risks the equity."

**Global Levers**
1. **Real-Time Scale Architecture:** "Architecting real-time conversational AI serving billions of messages requires deep systems expertise. That's Staff-level complexity: $265K base and $410K equity/4yr."
2. **Engagement-Driving Product Ownership:** "I'll own product surfaces that directly drive Character AI's signature engagement metrics. That product impact: $260K base."
3. **Competing Offers:** "I have a Meta E5 at $225K / $350K RSU and a Google L5 at $230K / $400K RSU. Character AI's product and upside are compelling: $265K base and $415K equity/4yr."
4. **Google Partnership De-Risk:** "The equity is de-risked by Google's investment, making $400K+ equity grants genuinely valuable. But base should still be competitive: $260K."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm a senior engineer with consumer platform experience at massive scale. Holding Meta E5 at $225K / $350K RSU and Google L5 at $230K / $400K RSU. Character AI's engagement is unprecedented and I want to build the infrastructure behind it. To join: $265K base, $410K equity/4yr, and a $50K signing bonus. Floor is $235K."
