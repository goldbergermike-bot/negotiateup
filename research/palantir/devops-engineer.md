### DevOps / Platform Engineer | Palantir Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Intensity Premium | Rule of 40: 127% | US Commercial Growth: 137% | 60+ Hour Culture

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Palo Alto | $148K–$185K | $225K–$370K | — | $204K–$278K |
| New York City | $152K–$190K | $230K–$380K | — | $210K–$285K |
| London | £78K–£100K | £112K–£188K | — | £106K–£147K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Palantir Platform Engineers build the infrastructure that runs Gotham, Foundry, and AIP in the most demanding deployment environments imaginable: air-gapped government networks, classified data centers, multi-cloud enterprise environments, and edge deployments in operational theaters. This is not standard cloud infrastructure — it's infrastructure that must work in environments with no internet access, extreme security constraints, and zero-tolerance reliability requirements. In 2026, AIP deployment infrastructure is the highest-leverage platform work: building the compute and serving infrastructure for AI agent deployment across diverse customer environments. No bonus; equity-heavy. The deployment complexity and potential classification requirements warrant a premium. [Source: Palantir Platform Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Palantir Senior Platform Eng = Google L4 SRE = Meta E4 Production Eng — but with air-gapped and classified environment requirements

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Air-Gapped Deployment Premium:** "I build infrastructure that works in air-gapped, classified environments. This is fundamentally harder than cloud-native infrastructure — and the security constraints limit my future job options."
- **Diverse Environment Engineering:** "I must support cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure), on-premises, air-gapped, and edge deployments simultaneously. That deployment diversity is 5x the complexity of cloud-only infrastructure."

**Global Levers**

1. **Air-Gapped Infrastructure — Hardest Platform Challenge:** "I build infrastructure that works in air-gapped government networks with no internet access. This is the hardest platform engineering challenge — no cloud APIs, no package managers, no external dependencies."
2. **Multi-Environment Deployment:** "Gotham, Foundry, and AIP deploy to cloud, on-premises, air-gapped, and edge simultaneously. I support 5+ deployment environments — 5x the complexity of cloud-only infrastructure companies."
3. **AIP Inference Infrastructure:** "AI agent deployment through AIP requires GPU compute infrastructure in diverse environments — including air-gapped. Building ML serving infrastructure without cloud access is uniquely Palantir."
4. **Maximum RSU Push:** "Below-market base, no bonus, 60+ hours, classification constraints, air-gapped engineering. RSUs must compensate: $355K over 4 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build infrastructure that works in air-gapped, classified environments — the hardest platform engineering challenge in enterprise software. Multi-environment deployment (cloud + on-prem + air-gapped + edge) is 5x the complexity of cloud-only companies. I'm targeting $355K in RSUs over 4 years. My competing platform offer from [Google/Databricks] is $310K total for cloud-only, 45-hour work." Accept at $310K+ RSUs.
