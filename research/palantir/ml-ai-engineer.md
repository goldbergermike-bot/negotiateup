**Negotiation DNA**

Palantir ML/AI Engineers are building AIP — the Artificial Intelligence Platform that is the most important enterprise AI product in the market and the driver of 137% US Commercial growth. AIP enables enterprises to deploy AI agents (powered by LLMs) on their own data, within their own security perimeter, governed by their own policies. You're building the AI agent deployment infrastructure, the LLM orchestration layer, the guardrail systems, and the ontology-aware AI that makes AIP the enterprise AI platform of choice. The Agentic AI Premium (25-40%) is the highest in the industry because Palantir's entire growth thesis IS agentic AI. No bonus; equity-heavy. The intensity culture plus agentic AI scarcity means your leverage is enormous. [Source: Palantir ML/AI Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Palantir Senior ML Eng = Google L4 ML = Meta E4 ML — but with enterprise AI deployment and classified environment experience

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **AIP = Palantir's Growth Thesis:** "AIP is not a feature — it's Palantir's entire growth strategy. ML engineers building AIP are the most strategically important engineers at the company. The equity must reflect this existential importance."
- **Agentic AI Scarcity + Palantir Intensity = Maximum Leverage:** "ML engineers who can build enterprise AI agents AND handle Palantir's intensity culture are the rarest talent combination. I have maximum negotiation leverage."
- **60+ Hours on AI = More Value:** "At 60+ hours/week building AIP, I ship 1.5-2x the AI features of a 40-hour FAANG ML engineer. The equity should reflect that accelerated value creation."

**Global Levers**

1. **AIP — Enterprise AI Platform:** "AIP is driving 137% US Commercial growth. I build the AI agent deployment platform that enterprises use to operationalize AI. This is the most important enterprise AI product in the market."
2. **Agentic AI Premium (25-40%):** "I build autonomous AI agents — systems that reason over enterprise data, take actions, and make decisions with human oversight. This is the purest form of agentic AI engineering, and it warrants the highest premium in the industry."
3. **LLM Orchestration + Guardrails:** "I build the LLM orchestration layer and guardrail systems that make AI agents safe and reliable in enterprise and government settings. AI safety engineering at this consequence level is rare."
4. **Maximum RSU Push — AIP ML Is Existential:** "Below-market base, no bonus, 60+ hours, and I build the product that drives 137% commercial growth. RSUs must be extraordinary: $490K over 4 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I build AIP — the product driving 137% US Commercial growth and Palantir's entire growth thesis. ML engineers building enterprise AI agents with the Agentic AI Premium at Palantir's intensity level are the rarest talent in enterprise software. I'm targeting $490K in RSUs over 4 years. Below-market base, no bonus, 60+ hours — but I ship 1.5-2x the AI features of a FAANG ML engineer. My Databricks ML offer with pre-IPO equity is $420K for 45 hours. Palantir's AIP opportunity is unique — but the equity must reflect that AIP ML engineers ARE Palantir's growth engine." Palantir has significant RSU flexibility for AIP ML talent. Accept at $440K+ RSUs.
