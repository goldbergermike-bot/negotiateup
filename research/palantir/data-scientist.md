**Negotiation DNA**

Palantir Data Scientists work with the most sensitive and consequential datasets in the world — intelligence community data, military operational data, financial market data, healthcare records, and supply chain networks. The DS role at Palantir is fundamentally different from FAANG: you deploy models in customer environments, sit in war rooms with analysts and decision-makers, and build ML solutions that affect national security and billion-dollar enterprise decisions. In 2026, AIP creates the highest-leverage DS role: building the AI agents and ML models that run on customer data within Foundry's ontology framework. No bonus; equity-heavy. The intensity and classification constraints (potential security clearance) warrant a premium. [Source: Palantir DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Palantir Senior DS = Google L4 DS = Meta IC4 DS — but with customer deployment and classified data access

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Classified Data Premium:** "If my role involves security clearance, that constrains my future employment options and personal travel. The equity must compensate for the classification constraint."
- **Customer-Deployed DS:** "I build and deploy models on-site in customer environments. That's fundamentally more demanding than building models in a FAANG office."

**Global Levers**

1. **Highest-Consequence DS Work:** "My models affect intelligence analysis, military operations, and billion-dollar business decisions. This is the highest-stakes DS work in the world — the consequences of model errors are national security-grade."
2. **AIP ML Agent Development:** "I build the ML models that power AIP's AI agents — autonomous decision support systems that enterprises deploy on their most sensitive data. This is agentic AI at the highest consequence level."
3. **Customer-Embedded Data Science:** "I deploy models in customer environments, iterate with analysts and decision-makers, and optimize in real-time. This forward-deployed DS model is unique to Palantir."
4. **Maximum RSU Push:** "Below-market base, no bonus, 60+ hours, potential clearance constraints, customer deployment. RSUs must compensate: $360K over 4 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'll be doing the highest-consequence data science in the world — deploying ML models that affect national security and billion-dollar decisions. Below-market base, no bonus, 60+ hours, and potential clearance constraints. I'm targeting $360K in RSUs over 4 years. My competing DS offer from [Google/Databricks] is $340K total for 45 hours with no clearance requirement." Accept at $320K+ RSUs.
