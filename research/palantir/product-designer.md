**Negotiation DNA**

Design at Palantir is mission-critical UX — you're designing interfaces that intelligence analysts use to identify threats, that military commanders use to coordinate operations, that Fortune 100 executives use to make billion-dollar decisions. The design challenge is extraordinary: making petabyte-scale data analysis, AI agent deployment (AIP), and complex ontology manipulation intuitive for non-technical users under time pressure. Palantir's design team is deliberately small — the company prioritizes engineering headcount, meaning each designer has outsized impact across Gotham, Foundry, and AIP. The intensity culture applies to design: 60+ hours, customer-site deployments, and rapid iteration cycles. No bonus; equity-heavy. [Source: Palantir Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Mission-Critical UX Premium:** "I design interfaces used for national security and billion-dollar business decisions. The stakes of my design work are literally life-and-death in some contexts."
- **Small Team, Maximum Impact:** "Palantir's design team is deliberately small. I cover a massive product surface area. Per-designer impact is 5-10x larger than at FAANG."

**Global Levers**

1. **Mission-Critical Design:** "I design for intelligence analysts, military commanders, and Fortune 100 executives. My design decisions affect national security outcomes and billion-dollar business decisions — the highest-stakes UX work in enterprise software."
2. **AIP Design — AI Agent UX:** "AIP's AI agent deployment interface is the UX challenge of 2026: making autonomous AI agent configuration, monitoring, and management intuitive for non-technical enterprise users."
3. **Deliberately Small Team:** "Palantir's design team is small by design. My per-designer impact across Gotham, Foundry, and AIP is 5-10x higher than at larger companies."
4. **Equity Push:** "Below-market base, no bonus, 60+ hours, mission-critical design. RSUs must compensate: $240K over 4 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I design mission-critical interfaces for intelligence analysts and Fortune 100 executives — the highest-stakes UX work in enterprise software. Palantir's small design team means my per-designer impact is 5-10x FAANG. I'm targeting $240K in RSUs over 4 years. Below-market base, no bonus, and 60+ hours means the equity must carry everything." Accept at $210K+ RSUs.
