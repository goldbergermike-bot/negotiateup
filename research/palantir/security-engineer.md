**Negotiation DNA**

Palantir Security Engineers have arguably the highest-stakes security role in enterprise software — securing platforms that handle intelligence community data, military operational data, classified information across multiple clearance levels, and the most sensitive enterprise data from Fortune 100 companies. The security surface is uniquely complex: air-gapped deployments, multi-classification environments, FedRAMP, IL4/IL5/IL6 accreditation, and commercial cloud security simultaneously. In 2026, AIP security is the highest-priority work: ensuring AI agents deployed through AIP can access and process sensitive data without creating new attack vectors. Security clearance is typically required. No bonus; equity-heavy. [Source: Palantir Security Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** Palantir Senior Security Eng = Google L4 Security = CrowdStrike Senior Eng — but with classified environment + security clearance requirements

**Culture & Intensity Negotiation**

- **Clearance Constraint Premium:** "Security clearance constrains my future employment, travel, and personal life. That life constraint warrants additional equity beyond standard security engineer comp."
- **Multi-Classification Security:** "I secure platforms across multiple classification levels — unclassified, secret, top secret. Multi-classification security is the hardest security engineering challenge."

**Global Levers**

1. **Highest-Stakes Security in Software:** "I secure platforms handling intelligence community and military data. A security failure at Palantir doesn't just cause a breach — it's a national security incident. These stakes justify premium security comp."
2. **Multi-Classification + Air-Gapped Security:** "I build security for unclassified, secret, and top secret environments simultaneously. Multi-classification security with air-gapped constraints is the most complex security engineering in the industry."
3. **AIP AI Security — New Attack Surface:** "AIP AI agent deployment creates new security challenges: prompt injection, data poisoning, model extraction, and AI-specific attack vectors on classified data. AI security at classification-level is a new frontier."
4. **Maximum RSU Push:** "Below-market base, no bonus, 60+ hours, clearance constraints, highest-stakes security. RSUs must compensate: $415K over 4 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I secure platforms handling the most sensitive data in the world — intelligence, military, and Fortune 100 enterprise data across multiple classification levels. Security clearance constrains my life and career options. Below-market base, no bonus, 60+ hours. I'm targeting $415K in RSUs over 4 years. My competing security offer from [CrowdStrike/Google] is $350K total for commercial-only security with no clearance requirement." Accept at $370K+ RSUs.
