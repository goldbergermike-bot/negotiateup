**Negotiation DNA**

Palantir SAs (often called "Deployment Strategists" or "Solutions Engineers") are the front line of Palantir's customer engagement — embedded with customer teams, designing data ontologies, configuring Foundry/AIP workflows, and demonstrating value through rapid prototyping. This is the most customer-facing technical role at Palantir, and the one most directly tied to revenue: SAs convert prospects, expand existing accounts, and drive adoption by making Palantir's platforms deliver measurable value. In 2026, AIP solutions architecture is the highest-value SA work: helping enterprises deploy AI agents on their own data. Travel is 50%+ — you live on-site with customers. No bonus; equity-heavy.

2. **AIP Solutions — 137% Growth Engine:** "AIP solutions architecture drives the 137% US Commercial growth. I architect AI agent deployments that are the most compelling proof points for AIP adoption."
3. **Revenue-Attributed SA Role:** "My deals and expansion revenue are directly attributable. SAs who drive $10M+ in ACV should be compensated proportionally."
4. **Maximum RSU Push:** "Below-market base, no bonus, 60+ hours, 50%+ travel. RSUs must compensate: $370K over 4 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I drive directly attributable revenue through customer-embedded solutions architecture — including AIP AI agent deployments that fuel 137% commercial growth. Below-market base, no bonus, 60+ hours, 50%+ travel. I'm targeting $370K in RSUs over 4 years. My competing SA offer from [Databricks/Snowflake] is $320K total with 20% travel."
