#### Negotiation DNA

Staff Software Engineers at Monzo operate at the highest individual contributor level, setting technical direction across multiple squads and driving platform-wide architectural decisions for a system serving 14M+ customers. This role carries significant seniority over Senior SWE, reflecting the scope of influence — Staff engineers at Monzo own cross-cutting concerns like platform reliability, API design standards, data architecture patterns, and the technical strategy for multi-region expansion. With the revived US OCC license bid, Staff SWEs are the engineers who will design the foundational architecture for Monzo's US banking platform — a once-in-a-career opportunity to build a regulated financial system from scratch while leveraging a proven UK platform. Monzo's first profit in 2024 validates the business model; the OCC bid signals the next growth phase. Pre-IPO options at this level represent the largest IC equity grants Monzo offers, and the current strike price is set before the US expansion premium is priced into the company's valuation.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customer Platform — Proven at Scale:** Monzo's 14M+ customer base means Staff engineers are not building speculative systems — they are extending proven, production-grade infrastructure to the US market. The scale validation de-risks the equity play: options are being granted in a company with demonstrated product-market fit, first profitability, and a clear path to public listing. Lock in options at pre-IPO strike prices before the OCC approval reprices the business.

- **OCC License = Architecture-Defining Moment:** The revived US OCC license bid means Staff engineers joining now will make foundational decisions — data residency architecture, multi-region transaction processing, US compliance event sourcing — that will persist for a decade. If the OCC bid succeeds, Monzo's addressable market expands 5-8x, and options granted at today's strike price before OCC approval carry asymmetric upside. Push for an additional £6K-£10K / $7K-$12K in annual options value to reflect this architecture-level leverage.

- **Pre-IPO Equity at Maximum Leverage:** With profitability achieved and IPO expected 2026-2027, Staff-level option grants at the current strike price represent the steepest part of the equity value curve. At a potential $15-25B IPO valuation post-US expansion, pre-IPO options at this level could yield £150K-£400K / $200K-$500K in pre-tax value over the vesting period. Frame your ask: "Staff-level architects who build the US banking platform from day zero are the highest-leverage hires Monzo will make this decade."

- **Early US Expansion Team — Talent Scarcity Premium:** There are fewer than 200 engineers in the UK with Staff-level experience in regulated financial platforms at Monzo's scale. The OCC bid means Monzo is competing for this talent now. Use this scarcity aggressively: request a £10K-£15K / $12K-$18K signing bonus or front-loaded vesting (40/30/20/10) to reflect the urgency and your unique positioning as a pre-IPO US expansion architect.

#### Global Levers

1. **Premium Equity Grant with Acceleration:** "At Staff level, I expect an options grant at the top of band. Given the OCC timeline, I'd like to discuss double-trigger acceleration — if a liquidity event occurs within 18 months, I want 50% acceleration on unvested options. This aligns my incentives with Monzo's most important strategic objective."

2. **Cash-to-Equity Trade-Up:** "I'm willing to accept a base of £95K instead of £110K if Monzo can increase my option grant by £6K-£8K / $7K-$10K annually. I want to maximize my exposure to the US expansion upside at today's strike price."

3. **Title & Scope Guarantee:** "I want written confirmation that my scope includes US expansion architecture ownership, with a formal Staff Engineer title from day one. If the initial offer is at 'Senior Engineer,' I need a 6-month promotion guarantee tied to measurable deliverables, with the full Staff equity package effective at hire."

4. **Advisory & Board Visibility:** "At Staff level, I expect to participate in architecture review boards and have direct input into the US expansion technical strategy. I'd like to discuss whether Monzo offers technical advisory equity top-ups for Staff engineers who contribute to strategic OCC compliance decisions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £108K-£155K / $132K-$189K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options and cross-squad architecture ownership. Remote UK candidates should push for £103K-£147K TC with equivalent options. Remote US candidates should target $172K-$246K TC by leveraging the 30% US premium and OCC-driven talent scarcity. Anchor against Stripe UK (£120K-£145K base), Google UK L5 (£110K-£140K base with liquid RSUs), or Revolut Staff (£100K-£130K base). The pre-IPO stock lock-in at Staff level is the highest-value lever in this entire negotiation.
