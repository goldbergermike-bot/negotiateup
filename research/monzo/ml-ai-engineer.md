#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at Monzo build the machine learning systems that power fraud detection, credit risk scoring, customer segmentation, transaction categorization, and intelligent financial insights for 14M+ customers. This role carries a significant AI premium over standard engineering compensation, reflecting the extreme scarcity of ML engineers with financial domain expertise and the direct revenue impact of ML models in banking. Monzo's ML stack processes billions of transaction events, deploying real-time inference models that make sub-second decisions on fraud, lending, and customer risk. The revived US OCC license bid introduces new ML challenges: building US-specific fraud models, fair lending ML systems that satisfy disparate impact requirements, and BSA/AML transaction monitoring models that meet OCC examination standards. Monzo turned profitable in 2024 — and ML-driven credit decisioning was a key revenue driver. Pre-IPO options for ML/AI engineers are among the most valuable in the company because your models directly generate lending revenue and prevent fraud losses.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customer Training Data Advantage:** Monzo's 14M+ customer base provides one of the largest proprietary financial ML training datasets in European fintech. ML engineers can train models with statistical power that competitors simply cannot match. Transfer learning approaches from UK to US consumer behavior give Monzo an asymmetric head start. This data advantage de-risks the pre-IPO equity play — your models are trained on proven data at scale. Lock in options before the US listing reprices this advantage.

- **OCC License = Fair Lending ML Revenue:** The revived US OCC license bid requires ML systems that satisfy US regulatory standards — fair lending (Reg B / ECOA) with disparate impact testing, OCC Model Risk Management (SR 11-7), and BSA/AML transaction monitoring. ML engineers who build these systems gain expertise in extreme demand across US financial services. If the OCC bid succeeds, your models directly generate US lending revenue. Push for an additional £5K-£8K / $6K-$10K in annual options to reflect the ML AI premium and OCC regulatory scope.

- **Pre-IPO Equity Linked to Direct P&L Impact:** ML models at Monzo directly drive lending revenue (credit scoring), prevent losses (fraud detection), and enable regulatory compliance (AML monitoring). The direct P&L impact of ML engineering is higher and more measurable than almost any other role. Pre-IPO options at current strike prices could yield £60K-£150K / $73K-$183K in pre-tax value at a $15-20B IPO. Frame this: "My models determine Monzo's US lending revenue, fraud loss ratio, and compliance posture — the three metrics most correlated with IPO valuation."

- **Early US Expansion Team — AI Talent Scarcity Premium:** The intersection of ML expertise, financial domain knowledge, and US regulatory compliance experience is extraordinarily narrow. Fewer than 500 professionals globally have built OCC-grade ML systems for a neobank. Request a £8K-£12K / $10K-$15K signing bonus for this rare specialization and to bridge the liquidity gap from public-company offers.

#### Global Levers

1. **AI Premium Equity Maximization:** "The ML/AI talent market commands a significant premium, and my models directly drive revenue and prevent losses. I'd like my options grant at the upper end of the ML band, reflecting both market scarcity and direct P&L impact at pre-IPO pricing."

2. **Fair Lending ML Specialization:** "I bring experience building fair lending ML systems that satisfy US regulatory requirements (ECOA, disparate impact testing). This is the most critical ML capability for the OCC application. I'd like a base of £88K+ (London) or $140K+ (Remote US) to reflect this scarce specialization."

3. **Compute Budget & Research Time:** "I'd like a confirmed annual compute budget of £8K-£12K / $10K-$15K for GPU/TPU training, plus a 20% time allocation for ML research and experimentation. Monzo's competitive advantage in ML depends on staying at the frontier — this investment has asymmetric returns."

4. **Publication & Conference Rights:** "I want to discuss Monzo's policy on publishing ML research. The ability to publish at top venues (NeurIPS, ICML, KDD) with appropriate anonymization is essential for ML career development and significantly strengthens Monzo's ML employer brand. I'd like a conference budget of £5K-£8K / $6K-$10K per year."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £82K-£120K / $100K-$146K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options and direct revenue impact of ML models. Remote UK candidates should push for £78K-£113K TC with equivalent options. Remote US candidates should target $130K-$190K TC by leveraging the 30% US premium and AI talent scarcity. Anchor against Revolut ML (£72K-£95K base), Stripe ML UK (£85K-£115K base), Google UK ML (£85K-£120K base with liquid RSUs), or DeepMind (£90K-£130K base). Lead with the P&L impact argument — your models directly drive the three metrics most correlated with IPO valuation.
