#### Compensation Benchmarks — 3-Region Model

| Region | Base Salary | Options (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| London (HQ) | £42K-£60K / $51K-$73K | £7K-£10K / $9K-$12K | £3K-£5K / $4K-$7K | £52K-£75K / $63K-$92K |
| Remote UK | £40K-£57K / $49K-$70K | £6K-£9K / $7K-$11K | £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K | £49K-£71K / $60K-$87K |
| Remote US | $66K-$95K | $12K-$16K | $4K-$9K | $82K-$120K |

*Monzo is private (pre-IPO). Options vest over 4 years with 1-year cliff. IPO expected 2026-2027. US OCC license bid pending.*

#### Negotiation DNA

Monzo has crossed the 14M+ customer milestone and turned its first annual profit in 2024 — fundamentally changing the negotiation landscape for Software Engineers joining the company. With the revived US OCC license bid signaling imminent US expansion, every engineering hire made now is a pre-IPO hire. Software Engineers at this level build the foundational services that power Monzo's platform: payments infrastructure, account management, and the microservices mesh (primarily Go and Kotlin) that handles millions of daily transactions for a UK-regulated bank. The Pre-IPO stock opportunity means options granted today could multiply 3-5x upon listing. Candidates should anchor negotiations around the scarcity of this window — once Monzo IPOs (expected 2026-2027), new hires receive RSUs at market price, not discounted options with asymmetric upside.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customer Validation:** Monzo's 14M+ customer base validates product-market fit at scale. Software Engineers joining now enter a proven platform — not a startup gamble. The customer milestone de-risks the pre-IPO equity play, making options grants closer to deferred cash than speculative bets. Use this: "Monzo has 14M+ customers and just turned profitable. My options aren't speculative — they're discounted equity in a proven business."

- **OCC License = US Revenue Multiplier:** The revived US OCC license bid would unlock full US banking operations — deposits, lending, and payments across all 50 states. For Software Engineers, this means building multi-regulatory payment rails and compliance infrastructure. If the OCC bid succeeds, Monzo's addressable market expands dramatically, and pre-IPO options granted at current strike prices could see 3-5x appreciation. Push for an additional £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K in annual options value to reflect this upside.

- **Pre-IPO Window Is Closing:** With profitability achieved and US expansion imminent, Monzo's IPO timeline (2026-2027) means the window for pre-IPO options is narrowing. Software Engineers hired in 2026 may be among the last to receive options at pre-listing strike prices. Frame your negotiation: "I want to lock in options before the US listing. Engineers hired post-IPO won't have this opportunity — I'm pricing that scarcity into my ask."

- **Early US Expansion Team Premium:** If positioned for US-facing work (payments, compliance, localization), Software Engineers can command a premium as early US expansion team members. The OCC bid signals that Monzo needs engineers who can build for US regulatory requirements from day one. Request a £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K signing bonus or accelerated vesting schedule for US-critical work.

#### Global Levers

1. **Pre-IPO Options Uplift:** "I'm joining pre-IPO with 14M+ customers and profitability proven. I'd like my options grant increased by £2K-£4K / $3K-$5K annually to reflect the closing pre-IPO window and the OCC expansion upside."

2. **US Expansion Scope Premium:** "The OCC license bid means Monzo is building US banking infrastructure now. I'll be contributing to multi-region payment systems — can we add a £2K-£3K / $2K-$4K scope adjustment for the regulatory complexity of US expansion work?"

3. **Signing Bonus for Equity Gap:** "My current employer's equity vests in 6 months. I'd like a £5K-£8K / $6K-$10K signing bonus to bridge the gap before my Monzo options begin vesting after the 1-year cliff."

4. **Remote UK/US Location Adjustment:** "I'm targeting Remote US for the expansion team. Given the 30% US premium for fintech engineers and the OCC-driven hiring urgency, I'd like my base adjusted to $66K-$95K with a proportional options increase."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £60K-£75K / $73K-$92K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options and OCC expansion scope. Remote UK candidates should push for £49K-£71K TC with equivalent options grants. Remote US candidates should target $82K-$120K TC by leveraging the US expansion premium and OCC license urgency. In every region, lead with the pre-IPO stock lock-in — this is the single most valuable lever at Monzo right now.
