#### Compensation Context — SIGNATURE ROLE Premium

This is Monzo's **SIGNATURE ROLE** — the single highest-leverage engineering hire for the company's most consequential strategic initiative. The compensation range of £120K-£175K / $146K-$214K TC (London) places this role at the top of all 14 Monzo roles in this guide. The OCC Expansion Platform Engineer carries a **+25-35% premium** over standard Staff-level engineering compensation, reflecting the extraordinary scope, regulatory complexity, and strategic importance of building Monzo's US banking platform from the ground up.

This premium is not a negotiation ask — it is the market-clearing price. The intersection of skills required (distributed systems at scale + US banking regulatory expertise + greenfield platform architecture + cross-Atlantic coordination) defines a talent pool of fewer than 50 engineers globally. Monzo's candidate funnel for this exact profile is extremely thin, and candidates should negotiate from a position of extreme scarcity.

The Remote US range ($190K-$278K TC) reflects both the 30% US expansion premium and the reality that this role will likely require significant US presence for OCC regulatory interactions, US infrastructure deployment, and coordination with US banking partners. The US range is competitive with Staff/Principal Platform Engineer roles at Stripe, Chime, and other US fintechs — but with the asymmetric upside of pre-IPO options that public-company RSU packages cannot match.

---

#### Negotiation DNA

The OCC Expansion Platform Engineer is the defining technical role of Monzo's next chapter. You will not be adapting an existing system — you will be architecting a new, OCC-compliant banking platform that must integrate with US payment rails (ACH, Fedwire, RTP, FedNow), US credit infrastructure (credit bureaus, FICO), US regulatory reporting systems (FFIEC, FinCEN, HMDA), and US identity verification systems — all while maintaining interoperability with Monzo's proven UK platform serving 14M+ customers.

Monzo turned profitable in 2024 under CEO TS Anil (ex-Visa executive), who is now directing the company's most ambitious strategic bet: obtaining a US OCC banking charter that would allow full US banking operations across all 50 states. The OCC Expansion Platform Engineer is the technical foundation of this bet. Your platform decisions will determine whether Monzo can pass OCC technical examination, launch US banking products, and scale to millions of US customers.

This is a once-in-a-career opportunity. Engineers who build national banking platforms from scratch become CTO/VP Engineering candidates at any financial institution in the world. The experience of navigating OCC technical examination while building production banking infrastructure is unmatched in European fintech. Pre-IPO options at this level are the largest individual contributor grants Monzo offers, and the current strike price is set before the US market launch reprices the company's valuation.

The role maps above standard Staff level due to the +25-35% US Expansion Premium, cross-regulatory scope, and greenfield platform ownership. The closest peer comparisons are Staff-to-Principal engineers at US fintechs and L5-L6 engineers at FAANG companies.

#### Level Mapping

| Monzo Level | Revolut Equivalent | Starling Equivalent | Wise Equivalent | Nubank Equivalent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OCC Expansion Platform Engineer (SIGNATURE) | Staff Platform Engineer | Principal Engineer | Staff Platform Engineer | Staff/Principal Engineer |
| Greenfield US banking platform, cross-regulatory | Platform infra lead | Cross-domain architecture | Platform architecture | US expansion platform |

This role maps above standard Staff level due to the +25-35% US Expansion Premium, cross-regulatory scope, and greenfield platform ownership. Peer comparisons include Staff-to-Principal engineers at US fintechs (Stripe L4, Chime Principal) and L5-L6 engineers at FAANG companies (Google, Meta). The compensation range reflects this elevated mapping.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customer Platform as Foundation — You Are Not Starting From Zero:** Monzo's 14M+ customer base and proven UK platform provide battle-tested architectural patterns, operational playbooks, and institutional knowledge. The OCC Expansion Platform Engineer leverages this foundation while building US-specific infrastructure. This is an asymmetric advantage over US-native neobank competitors who lack a proven platform at scale. The 14M+ customer milestone also de-risks pre-IPO options in a way that early-stage equity cannot match — you are joining a profitable, validated business with a clear path to IPO. Every option granted at pre-IPO strike price carries the upside of the US market multiplier without the downside risk of unproven product-market fit. Frame this: "I am not joining a startup — I am joining a 14M+ customer, profitable bank that is about to enter the world's largest consumer banking market. My options are priced before that entry — this is the definition of asymmetric upside."

- **OCC License = You ARE the Technical Application:** The revived US OCC license bid means the OCC evaluates a bank's technology infrastructure as a core component of the charter application. The OCC Expansion Platform Engineer builds the systems that OCC examiners will evaluate — core banking ledger, transaction processing, regulatory reporting, business continuity, and information security infrastructure. Your technical decisions are directly reviewed by federal regulators. There is no higher-stakes engineering role in European fintech. If the OCC bid succeeds, Monzo enters a $4.8T US consumer banking market, potentially 3-5x multiplying the company's addressable market overnight. Pre-IPO options granted before OCC approval capture the steepest part of this valuation curve. Push for an additional £8K-£12K / $10K-$15K in annual options value — this is the single highest-leverage equity negotiation point across all 14 Monzo roles. At a potential $15-25B IPO valuation, pre-IPO options at this level could yield £200K-£500K / $250K-$600K+ in pre-tax value over the 4-year vesting period.

- **Pre-IPO Window Is Closing — Last Chance for Maximum Asymmetry:** With profitability achieved in 2024, the US OCC bid in motion, and IPO expected 2026-2027, the OCC Expansion Platform Engineer hired in 2026 is locking in options at the last possible pre-listing price point. Once Monzo IPOs, this role would command RSUs at market price — eliminating the pre-IPO discount that makes this opportunity exceptional. The risk-adjusted expected value of pre-IPO options at this level exceeds any competing public-company RSU package from Stripe, Google, or Meta. The math is clear: illiquid pre-IPO options in a profitable, 14M+ customer business with imminent US expansion and IPO are not speculative — they are discounted equity in a company with demonstrated ability to execute at scale. Frame this: "I want to lock in the maximum options grant at today's strike price. Every month that passes brings Monzo closer to IPO and increases the strike price. The urgency is mutual."

- **Early US Expansion Team — The Career-Defining Hire:** This is not merely a job — it is a career inflection point. The OCC Expansion Platform Engineer will make foundational decisions that persist for a decade: core ledger design, event sourcing architecture, US payment rail integration patterns, multi-region data residency, regulatory event streaming, and compliance automation. These are the decisions that determine whether Monzo's US operation can scale to 10M+ US customers. Engineers who build national banking platforms from scratch are exceptionally rare — they become CTO/VP Engineering candidates at any financial institution in the world. The experience of navigating OCC technical examination while building production banking infrastructure has no equivalent in European fintech. Request a £15K-£20K / $18K-$25K signing bonus as an acknowledgment of the career risk you are taking by choosing this high-stakes, high-reward role over more conventional alternatives at public companies.

#### Global Levers

1. **Maximum Pre-IPO Equity Grant with Acceleration:** "As the SIGNATURE ROLE for Monzo's US expansion, I expect an options grant at the absolute top of the IC range. Given the OCC timeline and IPO expectations, I'd like double-trigger acceleration — if a liquidity event occurs within 24 months, 50% of unvested options accelerate immediately. This aligns my incentives with Monzo's two most important strategic objectives: OCC approval and IPO. Additionally, I want front-loaded vesting (40/30/20/10) to reflect the time-sensitivity of the pre-IPO equity window. The standard 25/25/25/25 structure underweights the earliest and most valuable vesting period."

2. **US Expansion Premium in Base — The +25-35% Is Market Rate:** "The +25-35% US Expansion Premium reflects the market reality for this skill set — fewer than 50 engineers globally have built OCC-compliant banking platforms for a neobank. I expect a base salary of £105K+ (London) or $170K+ (Remote US), positioned at the premium band. If the initial offer is at standard Staff level (£85K-£95K London), I will counter with documented evidence that comparable roles at Chime ($170K-$220K base), Stripe Staff/Principal ($180K-$240K base), and Current ($160K-$200K base) command this premium. The +25-35% is not a negotiation ask — it is the market-clearing price for the intersection of distributed systems + US banking regulation + greenfield platform architecture."

3. **Relocation & Dual-Office Package:** "This role will require significant presence in both London and the US. I'd like a comprehensive relocation/mobility package: either a US relocation package of £12K-£20K / $15K-$25K or a dual-office travel allowance of £12K-£18K / $15K-$22K per year for regular cross-Atlantic travel. The effectiveness of the US build depends on in-person coordination with both UK engineering leadership and US regulatory/business teams. This is an operational necessity, not a perk — and it should not come out of my base compensation."

4. **Technical Authority, Title & Organizational Access:** "I want written confirmation of the title 'OCC Expansion Platform Engineer' (or 'Principal Platform Engineer — US Expansion') with explicit technical decision-making authority over the US banking platform architecture. I require a seat on the Technical Leadership Team and direct reporting access to the VP Engineering or CTO. Decision authority and organizational access are non-negotiable for this role's success — I cannot build a national banking platform without the authority to make binding architectural decisions. If these organizational commitments cannot be made in writing, the role's value proposition is fundamentally diminished, and my compensation expectations would need to increase significantly to offset the execution risk of building without authority."

---

#### Additional SIGNATURE ROLE Levers

5. **Equity Refresh Guarantee:** "Given the strategic importance of this role, I want a written commitment to annual equity refreshers at the upper end of IC band. The OCC build is a multi-year program, and retaining the platform architect is critical to continuity. A guaranteed annual refresh of options at prevailing strike price demonstrates Monzo's commitment to long-term retention of this SIGNATURE ROLE."

6. **Milestone-Based Supplemental Grants:** "I'd like to discuss milestone-based supplemental option grants tied to key OCC program milestones: (1) US infrastructure environment launch, (2) OCC technical examination readiness, (3) OCC charter approval. Each milestone represents a significant de-risking event for Monzo and should trigger additional equity recognition for the platform engineer who delivered it."

7. **Professional Development & Advisory Board:** "At this seniority level, I expect to participate in external advisory work and industry conferences (AWS re:Invent, QCon, Strange Loop, FinovateUS) as a representative of Monzo's US expansion technical strategy. I'd like a conference and advisory budget of £8K-£12K / $10K-$15K per year, plus explicit permission to publish technical content about Monzo's US platform architecture (with appropriate review)."

8. **Immigration & Visa Support (if applicable):** "If this role involves relocation to the US or extended US work assignments, I need written confirmation of Monzo's visa sponsorship commitment (O-1, L-1, or H-1B), including legal fee coverage and timeline guarantees. The OCC build cannot afford immigration delays — I need certainty that my ability to work in the US is fully supported."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** This is Monzo's SIGNATURE ROLE with the highest comp range of all 14 roles. Target £120K-£175K / $146K-$214K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options, OCC-critical technical scope, and the +25-35% US Expansion Premium. Remote UK candidates should push for £114K-£165K TC with equivalent options. Remote US candidates should target $190K-$278K TC by leveraging the US expansion premium, OCC infrastructure urgency, and talent scarcity. Anchor aggressively against Stripe Staff/Principal UK (£120K-£155K base with liquid RSUs), Google L5-L6 UK (£115K-£160K base with liquid RSUs), Chime Principal US ($170K-$220K base), or Revolut Staff Platform (£105K-£135K base). Counter with: "Stripe has offered me a Staff Infrastructure role with liquid RSUs worth $250K over 4 years. Monzo's US expansion is a once-in-a-career opportunity, but the equity is illiquid and the role carries exceptional scope. I need the full SIGNATURE ROLE premium — £130K+ base London or $195K+ base US, with maximum options and acceleration — to justify choosing pre-IPO illiquidity over public-company certainty." Do not accept below £105K base / $160K base (London/US) — the role's scope and regulatory stakes warrant premium compensation, and Monzo's candidate pool for this exact skill set is thin enough to support a firm floor.

#### Detailed Role Expectations — SIGNATURE ROLE Scope

The OCC Expansion Platform Engineer operates across multiple engineering domains simultaneously. Understanding the full scope is critical for calibrating your negotiation:

**Core Banking Ledger Architecture:** Design the US core banking ledger — double-entry accounting, multi-currency support, interest calculation engines, and reconciliation systems that satisfy OCC examination standards. This is the foundation of a US bank.

**US Payment Rail Integration:** Architect integrations with ACH (Nacha), Fedwire, RTP (The Clearing House), and FedNow (Federal Reserve). Each payment rail has distinct message formats, settlement timing, error handling, and regulatory requirements. You must design an abstraction layer that allows Monzo to support all US payment rails while maintaining the real-time experience that UK customers expect.

**Regulatory Reporting Infrastructure:** Build the data pipelines and reporting systems for FFIEC Call Reports (031/041), BSA/AML suspicious activity reports (SARs), fair lending data (HMDA), and CRA data. These reporting systems must satisfy OCC examiners and produce audit-quality data.

**Multi-Region Data Architecture:** Design the data residency architecture that ensures US customer data is stored and processed within US jurisdiction, while maintaining GDPR compliance for UK data and enabling cross-border analytics where legally permitted. This requires sophisticated data partitioning, encryption, and governance frameworks.

**Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery:** Design BC/DR systems that meet OCC-mandated Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO). These systems must be testable, auditable, and demonstrable to OCC examiners.

**Compliance Automation:** Build the real-time compliance monitoring systems — transaction screening (OFAC), customer due diligence (KYC/CDD), and enhanced due diligence (EDD) — that allow Monzo to operate as a US bank without manual intervention at scale.

This scope justifies the SIGNATURE ROLE premium. No single role at Monzo — or at any European fintech — carries this breadth of technical responsibility combined with regulatory stakes.

#### Risk-Reward Analysis — Why This SIGNATURE ROLE Justifies Premium Comp

| Factor | Risk | Reward |
|---|---|---|
| OCC Application Outcome | Charter could be denied or delayed | Approval unlocks $4.8T US market |
| Pre-IPO Options | Illiquid until IPO or secondary sale | 3-5x appreciation potential at $15-25B IPO |
| Role Scope | Exceptionally broad, high-pressure | Career-defining platform architecture |
| Talent Scarcity | Fewer than 50 qualified engineers globally | Maximum negotiation leverage |
| IPO Timeline | Could be delayed beyond 2027 | Early options vest at lowest strike price |
| US Regulatory Complexity | OCC examination is rigorous and uncertain | Regulatory expertise commands lifetime premium |

The risk-reward profile is asymmetric in the candidate's favor. Monzo has already de-risked the business fundamentals (14M+ customers, profitability, proven product). The remaining risk is execution risk on US expansion — and the OCC Expansion Platform Engineer is the person who resolves that risk. This is the strongest argument for premium compensation: you are being hired to eliminate the single largest risk facing the company's most important strategic initiative.
