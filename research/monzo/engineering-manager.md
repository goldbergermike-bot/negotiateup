#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at Monzo lead squads of 5-10 engineers, owning delivery, team health, and technical quality for mission-critical banking features serving 14M+ customers. Unlike pure people-management roles at big tech, Monzo EMs retain meaningful technical context — they participate in architecture reviews, own squad-level technical roadmaps, and are expected to understand the codebase deeply enough to unblock engineers and make sound build-vs-buy decisions. The revived US OCC license bid amplifies this role's strategic importance: EMs will hire and lead the engineering teams that build Monzo's US banking platform, making talent acquisition judgment and cross-cultural team leadership core competencies. CEO TS Anil (ex-Visa executive) is scaling Monzo to profitability and US expansion — EMs who join now shape the organizational DNA of a company at its highest-leverage moment. Pre-IPO options at the EM level reflect both individual impact and organizational leverage — you are the multiplier that makes your squad effective.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customers = Organizational Scale Proof:** Monzo's 14M+ customer milestone validates not just the product but the engineering organization that built it. EMs joining now inherit a proven team culture and operational model while gaining the opportunity to extend it for US expansion. The customer milestone de-risks options grants — you are joining a profitable, validated business at pre-IPO equity pricing.

- **OCC License = Team-Building Multiplier:** The revived US OCC license bid requires Monzo to hire 50-100+ engineers within 12-18 months for US infrastructure. EMs who join now will shape hiring bars, interview processes, and team culture for the US engineering org. If the OCC bid succeeds, this organizational DNA influence is irreplaceable — and pre-IPO options granted before OCC approval capture the valuation upside. Push for an additional £5K-£8K / $6K-$10K in annual options to reflect the team-building multiplier.

- **Pre-IPO Window Closing for Management Hires:** With profitability achieved and IPO expected 2026-2027, EMs hired in 2026 lock in options at the last pre-listing price point. Your impact scales with your team — options at pre-IPO strike prices reflect organizational leverage worth £80K-£200K / $100K-$250K in potential pre-tax value over the vesting period at a $15-25B IPO valuation.

- **Early US Expansion Management Premium:** The OCC bid requires EMs who can manage distributed teams across UK and US time zones, navigate two regulatory frameworks (FCA + OCC), and maintain velocity on a platform serving 14M+ customers. This cross-Atlantic management complexity commands a 10-20% premium. Request a £8K-£12K / $10K-$15K signing bonus to bridge the liquidity gap from a public-company offer.

#### Global Levers

1. **Organizational Impact Equity:** "As an EM, my impact scales with my team. I'd like my options grant positioned at the upper end of band, reflecting the multiplier effect of hiring and retaining the engineers who will build the US expansion infrastructure under my leadership."

2. **Hiring Authority Premium:** "I want to negotiate a supplemental equity bonus tied to successfully hiring and retaining a full US expansion squad within 12 months. My ability to attract top talent is a direct value driver for Monzo's OCC timeline."

3. **Management Scope Guarantee:** "I want written confirmation that my scope includes the US expansion engineering workstream within 6 months, with a title progression to Senior Engineering Manager tied to team growth milestones. The comp package should reflect this trajectory from day one."

4. **Competing Offer Cash Anchor:** "I have an offer from a public fintech at £95K base with liquid RSUs worth £30K/year. To take the pre-IPO risk with Monzo, I need either £98K+ base or a signing bonus of £10K-£15K / $12K-$18K to bridge the first-year liquidity gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £88K-£128K / $107K-$156K TC in London by anchoring on organizational leverage and OCC team-building scope. Remote UK candidates should push for £84K-£121K TC with equivalent options. Remote US candidates should target $139K-$204K TC by leveraging the 30% US premium and cross-Atlantic management complexity. Anchor against Revolut EM (£85K-£110K base), Starling EM (£75K-£95K base), Wise EM (£80K-£100K base), or Google UK EM (£100K-£130K base with liquid RSUs). The pre-IPO stock lock-in combined with organizational multiplier makes this the strongest lever.
