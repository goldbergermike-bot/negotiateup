#### Negotiation DNA

Senior Software Engineers at Monzo are the technical backbone of a platform processing billions in transactions for 14M+ customers. At this level, you own subsystem design, mentor junior engineers, and drive architectural decisions within your squad. Monzo's engineering culture — rooted in Go microservices, event-driven architecture, and a strong infrastructure-as-code philosophy — means seniors are expected to operate with high autonomy. The revived US OCC license bid creates a unique inflection: Senior SWEs joining now will shape the dual-region banking platform from the ground up. Pre-IPO options at this seniority level represent meaningful wealth-creation potential, particularly given Monzo's trajectory from first profitability in 2024 toward a potential public listing in 2026-2027. Candidates at this level should negotiate aggressively on equity, as the option pool tightens with each funding round and the pre-IPO window narrows.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customer Validation at Scale:** Monzo's 14M+ customer milestone is the strongest proof of product-market fit in European neobanking. Senior SWEs joining now are not taking a startup risk — they are joining a validated, profitable business with pre-IPO equity pricing. The customer base de-risks option grants while preserving asymmetric upside. Use this: "14M+ customers and profitability mean my options carry far less risk than typical pre-IPO equity — but they still carry pre-IPO upside."

- **OCC License = Dual-Region Architecture Premium:** The revived US OCC license bid would require Senior SWEs to architect systems serving both UK (FCA-regulated) and US (OCC-regulated) markets simultaneously. This cross-regulatory platform experience is exceptionally rare and commands a 15-20% premium at peer companies. Push for an additional £4K-£6K / $5K-$7K in annual options value. If the OCC bid succeeds, pre-IPO options granted at current strike prices could appreciate 3-5x as Monzo's addressable market multiplies.

- **Pre-IPO Window Narrowing Fast:** With Monzo's first profit in 2024 and US expansion in motion, the IPO timeline (2026-2027) means Senior SWEs hired in 2026 lock in options at the steepest part of the equity value curve. Frame your ask: "I am joining at the highest-leverage moment — after product-market fit is proven but before the US expansion and IPO reprice my equity. My options grant should reflect this timing."

- **Early US Expansion Team Membership:** Senior SWEs positioned for US-facing infrastructure (payment rails, compliance systems, data residency) are building the technical foundation of Monzo's US bank. The OCC bid signals this is a committed strategic priority. Request £5K-£8K / $6K-$10K in signing bonus or supplemental options as an early US expansion team premium.

#### Global Levers

1. **Pre-IPO Equity Maximization:** "At the senior level, I want my equity to reflect the strategic moment. I'd like my options grant increased by £4K-£6K / $5K-$7K annually, with a discussion about accelerated vesting tied to a liquidity event within 24 months."

2. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I have a competing offer from Revolut at £80K base with a substantial RSU package. Monzo's pre-IPO optionality is compelling, but the offer needs to reflect the risk premium of illiquid equity — I'd like to see £82K+ base or a £8K-£12K / $10K-$15K signing bonus to offset the liquidity gap."

3. **US Expansion Role Pathway:** "I want to discuss a formal pathway to a US Expansion engineering lead role within 12-18 months. If I'm contributing to the OCC infrastructure build, I'd like that reflected in both my title trajectory and a supplemental option grant tied to US launch milestones."

4. **Performance Equity Refresh:** "I'd like written confirmation of Monzo's equity refresh policy at the senior level — specifically, the cadence and typical grant size for top performers. A commitment to annual refreshers demonstrates Monzo's investment in long-term retention at pre-IPO pricing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £75K-£108K / $92K-$132K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options and dual-regulatory architecture scope. Remote UK candidates should push for £71K-£102K TC with equivalent options. Remote US candidates should target $120K-$172K TC by leveraging the 30% US expansion premium and OCC license urgency. Lead with competing offers from Revolut (£80K-£100K base), Wise (£75K-£92K base), or Starling (£68K-£85K base) to create urgency. In every region, the pre-IPO stock lock-in is the single most powerful negotiation lever.
