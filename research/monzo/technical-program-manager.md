#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at Monzo orchestrate the delivery of complex, cross-functional programs that span multiple engineering squads, product teams, and stakeholder groups serving 14M+ customers. This is not a project management role — Monzo TPMs are expected to have sufficient technical depth to understand system dependencies, identify architectural risks, and facilitate trade-off decisions between engineering teams. The revived US OCC license bid makes this role disproportionately important: the OCC application itself is a multi-year regulatory program with dozens of workstreams (technology infrastructure, compliance systems, risk management, capital planning) that require sophisticated program orchestration. TPMs who join now will run some of the most consequential programs in Monzo's history. Monzo turned profitable in 2024, and TPMs ensure the execution velocity that enables US expansion on timeline. Pre-IPO options reflect the program delivery leverage — you are the multiplier that ensures cross-team execution.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customer Platform — Program Complexity at Scale:** Managing programs across a platform serving 14M+ customers means every release, migration, and infrastructure change carries real customer impact. TPMs at Monzo operate under banking-grade program governance. This scale experience validates pre-IPO options — you are joining a proven operation, not a speculative venture. Lock in options before the US listing reprices equity.

- **OCC License = Highest-Stakes Program Leadership:** The revived US OCC license bid is itself a massive program — requiring coordination across legal, compliance, engineering, risk, and executive teams over 12-24 months. TPMs who lead OCC workstreams gain experience directly transferable to any regulated financial institution globally. If the OCC bid succeeds, pre-IPO options capture the valuation uplift from US market entry. Push for an additional £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K in annual options for OCC program scope.

- **Pre-IPO Program Delivery = IPO Readiness:** Many programs TPMs deliver (SOX-readiness, audit infrastructure, financial reporting systems) are direct prerequisites for IPO. TPMs who accelerate these programs are accelerating Monzo's path to public listing — and their options at pre-IPO strike prices benefit most from this timeline acceleration. Potential value of £30K-£80K / $37K-$98K in pre-tax value at a $15-20B IPO.

- **Early US Expansion Team — Regulatory Stakeholder Access:** The OCC bid requires TPMs who can interface with OCC examiners, external auditors, and board-level stakeholders. This regulatory stakeholder management experience is career-defining and extremely rare at this career stage. Request a £4K-£6K / $5K-$7K signing bonus for regulatory program management expertise.

#### Global Levers

1. **OCC Program Leadership Equity:** "Leading the OCC application program is the highest-stakes program at Monzo. I'd like my options grant positioned at the upper end of TPM band, with a milestone-based discussion about supplemental options tied to OCC application milestones."

2. **Regulatory Program Premium:** "I bring experience managing regulatory programs in financial services. This is critical for the OCC timeline and rare in the UK TPM market. I'd like a 10-15% base premium (£60K+ London / $88K+ Remote US) to reflect this specialized background."

3. **Program Scope Guarantee:** "I want written confirmation that my scope includes the US expansion program portfolio — not just a single squad's delivery. The compensation should reflect multi-program ownership, with a title progression to Senior TPM tied to program delivery milestones."

4. **Stakeholder Exposure & Development:** "The OCC program requires direct interaction with regulators, auditors, and board members. I'd like a professional development budget of £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K per year for regulatory certifications (CAMS, PMP, SAFe) and stakeholder management training."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £58K-£85K / $71K-$104K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options and OCC program leadership scope. Remote UK candidates should push for £55K-£81K TC with equivalent options. Remote US candidates should target $93K-$135K TC by leveraging the 30% US premium and regulatory program urgency. Anchor against Revolut TPM (£55K-£72K base), Stripe TPM UK (£60K-£80K base), or Google UK TPM (£62K-£85K base with liquid RSUs). Lead with the OCC program complexity argument — this is the highest-stakes program in European fintech.
