#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at Monzo are responsible for the reliability, scalability, and security of infrastructure that processes millions of financial transactions daily for 14M+ customers. Monzo operates one of the most sophisticated Kubernetes-based banking platforms in the world — running thousands of microservices on AWS with a strong infrastructure-as-code ethos (Terraform, custom tooling). This is not a typical DevOps role: you are operating critical national financial infrastructure under FCA supervision, where downtime has regulatory consequences. The revived US OCC license bid introduces an entirely new infrastructure challenge — multi-region deployment across US and UK data centers, US data residency compliance, and OCC-mandated disaster recovery and business continuity standards. Monzo turned profitable in 2024, and infrastructure reliability was a key enabler. Pre-IPO options at this level reflect the foundational importance of infrastructure reliability to Monzo's banking license and business continuity.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customer Scale Reliability:** Operating infrastructure for 14M+ banking customers means zero-downtime deployments, canary rollout strategies, and instant rollback capabilities are not aspirational — they are regulatory requirements. This production experience at scale is a career differentiator and validates the pre-IPO equity opportunity. Lock in options at a company where platform reliability is already proven at massive scale.

- **OCC License = Multi-Region Infrastructure Build:** The revived US OCC license bid requires US-based data processing, storage, and disaster recovery. DevOps engineers will architect Monzo's first US-region deployment — designing multi-region Kubernetes clusters, cross-Atlantic networking, and data replication systems that meet banking-grade latency and consistency requirements. If the OCC bid succeeds, pre-IPO options capture the valuation uplift from US infrastructure. Push for an additional £3K-£4K / $4K-$5K in annual options for multi-region build scope.

- **Pre-IPO Infrastructure = Foundation of Valuation:** If the platform goes down, the bank cannot operate. DevOps engineers who ensure 99.99%+ uptime for a banking platform are directly protecting Monzo's revenue, reputation, and IPO valuation. Options at pre-IPO strike prices reflect this critical-path importance — potential value of £30K-£80K / $37K-$98K in pre-tax value at a $15-20B IPO.

- **Early US Expansion Team — OCC Business Continuity:** The OCC mandates specific Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for core banking systems. DevOps engineers who design and validate these systems gain expertise in regulatory-grade infrastructure in critical demand across US banking. Request a £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K signing bonus for OCC-critical infrastructure skills.

#### Global Levers

1. **Infrastructure Criticality Equity:** "Platform reliability is the foundation of Monzo's banking license. I'd like my options grant positioned at the upper end of band, reflecting the regulatory criticality of the infrastructure I'll be building and maintaining for both UK and US operations."

2. **US Multi-Region Build Premium:** "The US expansion requires building multi-region infrastructure from scratch — US data residency, cross-Atlantic DR, OCC-mandated recovery standards. I'd like a 10-15% base premium (£58K+ London / $80K+ Remote US) for this specialized capability."

3. **On-Call Compensation Clarity:** "Given the 24/7 nature of banking infrastructure, I want to clarify Monzo's on-call compensation structure. I'd like either a formal on-call stipend of £500-£800 / $600-$1,000 per month or an equivalent increase in base salary to reflect the always-on nature of this role."

4. **Certification & Training Budget:** "I'd like a confirmed annual budget of £4K-£6K / $5K-$7K for cloud certifications (AWS Solutions Architect, CKA/CKAD), security certifications, and conference attendance (KubeCon, SREcon). These certifications directly benefit Monzo's OCC application by demonstrating infrastructure team expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £55K-£80K / $67K-$98K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options and infrastructure criticality. Remote UK candidates should push for £52K-£76K TC with equivalent options. Remote US candidates should target $87K-$127K TC by leveraging the 30% US premium and OCC infrastructure urgency. Anchor against Revolut DevOps (£55K-£72K base), Wise SRE (£52K-£68K base), or AWS/Google UK SRE (£60K-£85K base with liquid RSUs). Lead with the infrastructure-as-banking-license argument — if the platform fails, the bank fails.
