#### Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at Monzo protect the financial data, transaction integrity, and platform security of a banking system serving 14M+ customers. This is not corporate IT security — this is banking-grade security engineering for a platform that processes billions of pounds in transactions annually under FCA regulatory supervision. You will work on application security, infrastructure security, threat detection, incident response, and security architecture across a microservices platform with 1,500+ services. The revived US OCC license bid makes Security Engineers among the most critical hires Monzo will make: the OCC requires comprehensive security programs under 12 CFR Part 30, and any security gaps could delay or deny the banking charter. Monzo turned profitable in 2024, and security infrastructure was essential to maintaining regulatory standing. Pre-IPO options for Security Engineers carry a premium reflecting the existential importance of security to Monzo's banking license, regulatory standing, and customer trust.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customer Security Scale:** Monzo's 14M+ customer base means the security threat landscape is massive — account takeover, payment fraud, social engineering, API abuse, insider threats. Security Engineers must defend against all of these at scale while maintaining a frictionless user experience. This production security experience at banking scale validates the pre-IPO equity opportunity and differentiates your career. Lock in options at a company where security is already battle-tested at 14M+ scale.

- **OCC License = Security on the Critical Path:** The revived US OCC license bid makes security engineering a direct prerequisite for the banking charter. The OCC mandates comprehensive information security programs under 12 CFR Part 30 and uses the FFIEC Cybersecurity Assessment Tool to evaluate applicants. Without robust security infrastructure, there is no US bank. If the OCC bid succeeds, pre-IPO options capture massive valuation uplift. Push for an additional £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K in annual options for OCC-critical security scope.

- **Pre-IPO Equity Linked to Existential Risk:** A major security breach could devastate Monzo's IPO prospects and customer trust. Security Engineers are protecting the company's most valuable asset — its reputation. Pre-IPO options at current strike prices could yield £40K-£100K / $49K-$122K in pre-tax value at a $15-20B IPO. Frame this: "Security is not a support function — it's a regulatory requirement for the OCC charter and an existential safeguard for the IPO."

- **Early US Expansion Team — Dual-Regulatory Security Premium:** Maintaining security compliance across both FCA (UK) and OCC (US) regulatory frameworks simultaneously requires expertise in both jurisdictions. This dual-compliance capability is exceptionally rare and commands a 15-25% premium. Request a £5K-£8K / $6K-$10K signing bonus for dual-regulatory security expertise.

#### Global Levers

1. **OCC-Critical Equity Premium:** "Security engineering is on the critical path for the OCC banking charter. I'd like my options grant positioned at the upper end of the security band, reflecting regulatory criticality and the scarcity of engineers with banking-grade security experience."

2. **Dual-Regulatory Security Premium:** "I bring experience with both FCA and US financial regulatory security requirements (OCC, FFIEC, SOX). This dual-jurisdiction expertise is critical for the OCC application and nearly impossible to find. I'd like a 15-20% base premium (£68K+ London / $100K+ Remote US) to reflect this specialization."

3. **Security Certification Investment:** "I'd like a confirmed budget of £5K-£8K / $6K-$10K per year for security certifications (OSCP, CISSP, CISM, AWS Security Specialty) and conference attendance (Black Hat, DEF CON, BSides). These certifications directly strengthen Monzo's OCC application by demonstrating security team credentials."

4. **Incident Response On-Call Premium:** "Banking security requires 24/7 incident response readiness. I want to clarify the on-call compensation structure — I'd like either a formal on-call stipend of £600-£1,000 / $700-$1,200 per month or an equivalent base salary increase, plus guaranteed time-off-in-lieu for incident response."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £62K-£90K / $76K-$110K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options and OCC-critical security scope. Remote UK candidates should push for £59K-£85K TC with equivalent options. Remote US candidates should target $99K-$143K TC by leveraging the 30% US premium and dual-regulatory security urgency. Anchor against Revolut Security (£65K-£85K base), Goldman Sachs Security (£72K-£95K base with bonus), or Google UK Security (£72K-£98K base with liquid RSUs). Lead with the existential risk argument — security is on the critical path for both the OCC charter and the IPO.
