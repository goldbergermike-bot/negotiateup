#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at Monzo sit at the intersection of product, risk, and commercial strategy, leveraging one of the richest consumer financial datasets in European fintech — 14M+ customers generating billions of transaction records, spending patterns, savings behaviors, and credit signals. This is not a dashboard-building role. Monzo's data scientists build causal inference models for product decisions, credit risk models that determine lending outcomes, and fraud detection systems that operate at scale. The revived US OCC license bid introduces an entirely new data dimension: building US-market risk models, fair lending analytics, and regulatory reporting pipelines that must satisfy OCC examiners. Monzo turned profitable in 2024 — and data science was a key driver through credit decisioning and customer lifetime value optimization. Pre-IPO options are particularly compelling for data scientists because your models directly influence Monzo's revenue and risk profile — the two metrics most correlated with IPO valuation.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customer Dataset Advantage:** Monzo's 14M+ customer base provides one of the largest proprietary financial datasets in European fintech. Data Scientists can train models with statistical power that competitors cannot match. Transfer learning approaches from UK to US consumer behavior give Monzo a massive head start for US model development. This data advantage de-risks pre-IPO options while preserving asymmetric upside — lock in equity before the US listing.

- **OCC License = US Risk Model Revenue:** The revived US OCC license bid requires building US-specific risk models for credit decisioning, BSA/AML transaction monitoring, and fair lending compliance (Reg B / ECOA). Data Scientists who build these models from scratch for the US market gain specialized expertise in extreme demand — fewer than 500 professionals globally have built OCC-grade risk models for a neobank. If the OCC bid succeeds, your models directly generate US lending revenue. Push for an additional £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K in annual options for US regulatory DS scope.

- **Pre-IPO Equity Linked to Revenue Impact:** Your credit risk models, churn prediction models, and lifetime value models directly drive Monzo's revenue and profitability. The direct P&L impact of data science is more measurable than almost any other role. Pre-IPO options at current strike prices could yield £40K-£100K / $49K-$122K in pre-tax value at a $15-20B IPO. Frame this: "My models drive lending revenue — the metric most directly tied to IPO valuation."

- **Early US Expansion Team — Regulatory Data Premium:** Data Scientists who build fair lending ML systems, disparate impact testing frameworks, and OCC-grade model validation gain career-defining regulatory experience. This specialization alone commands a 15-20% premium across fintech. Request a £4K-£6K / $5K-$7K signing bonus for regulatory data science expertise.

#### Global Levers

1. **Revenue-Linked Equity Grant:** "My risk and credit models directly generate Monzo's lending revenue. I'd like my options grant positioned at the upper end of the DS band to reflect the direct revenue impact of model quality and the pre-IPO timing window."

2. **US Regulatory Data Premium:** "I bring experience in fair lending analytics and regulatory-grade model validation. This is critical for the OCC application and extremely scarce — I'd like a 15% base premium (£65K+ London / $95K+ Remote US) to reflect this specialization."

3. **Compute & Tooling Budget:** "I'd like a confirmed annual budget of £5K-£8K / $6K-$10K for cloud compute (GCP/AWS), conference attendance (NeurIPS, KDD), and professional development tools. Access to adequate compute is essential for model development at 14M+ customer scale."

4. **Publication Rights:** "I want to discuss Monzo's policy on publishing anonymized research. The ability to publish work on financial ML models at conferences like KDD or ICAIF is a significant professional development incentive that also strengthens Monzo's employer brand in data science."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £60K-£88K / $73K-$107K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options and direct revenue impact of risk models. Remote UK candidates should push for £57K-£84K TC with equivalent options. Remote US candidates should target $95K-$140K TC by leveraging the 30% US premium and OCC regulatory data urgency. Anchor against Revolut DS (£60K-£80K base), Wise DS (£55K-£72K base), or OakNorth DS (£62K-£78K base). Lead with the revenue-linked equity argument — your models directly drive IPO valuation.
