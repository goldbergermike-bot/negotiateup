#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at Monzo build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers analytics, machine learning, regulatory reporting, and product insights across a platform serving 14M+ customers. This is mission-critical data engineering — Monzo's event-driven architecture generates massive volumes of transaction events, user behavior data, and financial signals that must be processed reliably, stored durably, and made queryable for hundreds of internal consumers. You will work with Apache Kafka, BigQuery, dbt, Airflow, and custom data tooling to build pipelines that are auditable, lineage-tracked, and compliant with financial data regulations. The revived US OCC license bid creates a new data engineering frontier: building US-compliant data infrastructure with strict data residency, regulatory reporting pipelines, and cross-border data governance. Monzo turned profitable in 2024, driven in part by data-informed product and lending decisions. Pre-IPO options reflect the foundational importance of data infrastructure to every function at Monzo.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customer Data Scale:** Processing transaction data, event streams, and analytics queries for 14M+ customers at banking-grade reliability is a data engineering challenge that few companies offer. This scale experience validates the pre-IPO equity play — you are joining a proven data platform, not building speculative infrastructure. Lock in options at pre-IPO pricing before the US listing.

- **OCC License = US Data Residency Architecture:** The revived US OCC license bid requires US customer data to be stored and processed within US jurisdiction. Data Engineers will design the data residency architecture — partitioning data by jurisdiction, building cross-border data governance frameworks, and ensuring compliance with both GDPR (UK/EU) and US financial data regulations simultaneously. If the OCC bid succeeds, pre-IPO options capture the valuation uplift. Push for an additional £3K-£4K / $4K-$5K in annual options for US data residency scope.

- **Pre-IPO Equity Linked to Cross-Functional Leverage:** The data platform enables ML models (credit risk, fraud detection), product analytics (feature adoption, churn prediction), and regulatory compliance (reporting, auditing). Every revenue-generating and risk-managing function depends on data infrastructure. Pre-IPO options at current strike prices could yield £30K-£80K / $37K-$98K in pre-tax value at a $15-20B IPO. Your infrastructure enables the entire value chain.

- **Early US Expansion Team — Regulatory Reporting Pipelines:** OCC-regulated banks must file Call Reports (FFIEC 031/041), BSA/AML suspicious activity reports, and fair lending data (HMDA). Data Engineers who build these regulatory reporting pipelines from scratch gain expertise in critical demand across US banking. Request a £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K signing bonus for regulatory data pipeline expertise.

#### Global Levers

1. **Cross-Functional Data Platform Equity:** "The data platform I build enables ML, analytics, regulatory reporting, and product decisions. I'd like my options grant positioned at the upper end of band, reflecting the cross-functional leverage of data infrastructure and the pre-IPO timing."

2. **US Data Residency Build Premium:** "Building a US data residency architecture that satisfies OCC requirements while maintaining GDPR compliance is a specialized capability. I'd like a 10-15% base premium (£58K+ London / $85K+ Remote US) for this dual-jurisdiction data governance expertise."

3. **Cloud & Tooling Budget:** "I'd like a confirmed annual budget of £4K-£6K / $5K-$7K for cloud compute (BigQuery, GCP/AWS), data engineering certifications (GCP Professional Data Engineer, dbt certification), and conference attendance (Data Council, dbt Coalesce)."

4. **Data Community & Publication:** "I want to discuss Monzo's support for data engineering community contributions — blog posts, open-source tooling, and conference talks. Monzo's data engineering blog is a strong employer brand asset, and my ability to contribute publicly is a meaningful professional development incentive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £55K-£82K / $67K-$100K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options and cross-functional data platform leverage. Remote UK candidates should push for £52K-£78K TC with equivalent options. Remote US candidates should target $87K-$130K TC by leveraging the 30% US premium and US data residency urgency. Anchor against Revolut DE (£55K-£72K base), Wise Analytics Eng (£52K-£68K base), or Google UK DE (£60K-£82K base with liquid RSUs). Lead with the cross-functional leverage argument — data infrastructure enables every revenue-generating function at Monzo.
