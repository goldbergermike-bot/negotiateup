#### Negotiation DNA

Product Managers at Monzo own the roadmap, discovery, and delivery of features used by 14M+ customers across one of Europe's most influential digital banks. This is not a PM role where you write specs for engineers — Monzo's product culture demands PMs who can synthesize user research, regulatory constraints, commercial goals, and technical feasibility into clear product bets. With the revived US OCC license bid, PMs joining now have a rare opportunity: defining the product strategy for an entirely new market (US consumer banking) while leveraging a proven UK product serving millions. Monzo turned profitable in 2024 under CEO TS Anil's leadership, validating the business model. Pre-IPO options are the primary wealth-creation vehicle — PMs who shape Monzo's US product-market fit will be among the highest-leverage hires in the company's history, locking in equity before the US listing reprices everything.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customers = Product-Market Fit Proven:** Monzo's 14M+ customer base validates the product strategy that PMs will extend to the US market. You are not defining product-market fit from scratch — you are adapting a proven, beloved product for a new geography. This validation de-risks options grants and makes pre-IPO equity closer to deferred compensation than speculation. Use this: "14M+ customers prove the product works. My US product decisions build on validated foundations — my options should reflect that reduced risk."

- **OCC License = US Product Definition Opportunity:** The revived US OCC license bid means PMs will define Monzo's US product offering — which features to launch first, how to adapt the UK experience for US consumers, what regulatory-compliant product flows look like. If the OCC bid succeeds, the PM who defines US product-market fit shapes a business that could rival the UK operation in revenue within 3-5 years. Pre-IPO options granted now, before OCC approval, capture this upside. Push for an additional £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K in annual options value.

- **Pre-IPO Window Closing for Product Hires:** With profitability achieved and IPO expected 2026-2027, PMs hired in 2026 are among the last to receive options at pre-listing strike prices. The delta between current strike and post-OCC valuation could yield £50K-£120K / $60K-$150K in pre-tax options value over the vesting period at a $15-20B IPO valuation. Frame this: "I want to lock in pre-IPO equity before the US listing prices me out."

- **Early US Expansion Team — Regulatory Product Premium:** PMs with experience shipping products in regulated environments are critical for OCC compliance. US banking products must comply with BSA/AML, fair lending requirements, and CRA obligations. This regulated product expertise commands a 15-20% premium and is in short supply. Request a £5K-£8K / $6K-$10K signing bonus for regulatory product specialization.

#### Global Levers

1. **US Product Strategy Equity Premium:** "My experience in consumer fintech product management directly applies to the US expansion challenge. I'd like an equity uplift above the standard PM band — reflecting the strategic impact of the US product role and the pre-IPO timing."

2. **Regulated Product Specialization:** "I have experience shipping products in regulated environments, which is critical for OCC compliance. I'd like this reflected in a base salary at the top of band (£68K+ London / $100K+ Remote US) rather than mid-band, given the scarcity of PMs with this regulatory product background."

3. **Signing Bonus for Liquidity Bridge:** "I'm leaving a public company where I have liquid equity vesting quarterly. A signing bonus of £6K-£10K / $7K-$12K would offset the first-year liquidity gap and demonstrate Monzo's commitment to competitive total compensation."

4. **Career Acceleration Clause:** "I want a written commitment to a Senior PM review within 12 months, with a pre-agreed equity refresh upon promotion. The US expansion will accelerate my scope faster than typical career timelines, and the compensation should follow."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £62K-£90K / $76K-$110K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options and US product definition scope. Remote UK candidates should push for £59K-£85K TC with equivalent options grants. Remote US candidates should target $99K-$143K TC by leveraging the 30% US premium and OCC product urgency. Anchor against Revolut PM (£62K-£82K base), Wise PM (£60K-£78K base), or Starling PM (£55K-£72K base). The pre-IPO stock lock-in and US product ownership together form the strongest negotiation position.
