#### Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at Monzo shape the experience of one of the world's most recognized consumer banking apps, used daily by 14M+ customers. Monzo's design team is legendary in UK fintech — the hot coral card, the spending insights UI, the real-time notification system — these are design decisions that redefined what consumers expect from a bank. At this role level, you own end-to-end design for a squad: user research, interaction design, visual design, prototyping, and design system contribution. The revived US OCC license bid creates a rare design challenge: adapting a beloved UK product experience for US consumer expectations, US regulatory disclosure requirements, and US accessibility standards — while maintaining the Monzo design DNA. Monzo turned profitable in 2024, validating the design-led approach. Pre-IPO options mean your design work directly translates to equity value before the US listing reprices the opportunity.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customer Design Validation:** Monzo's 14M+ customer base validates the design system and product experience that designers will adapt for the US market. Every design decision at Monzo is tested against 14M+ real users — this is the kind of impact that takes years to achieve at other companies. The data-informed design culture means your portfolio will feature work validated at massive scale. Lock in options before this proven platform goes public.

- **OCC License = US Design Adaptation Opportunity:** The revived US OCC license bid requires designing a banking app for US consumers with fundamentally different mental models — checking accounts, credit scores, tipping culture, and tax integration. Designers who lead this adaptation will define Monzo's US brand identity. OCC-regulated products also require specific disclosure formats and ADA accessibility compliance. This regulatory design expertise is scarce and commands a premium. Push for an additional £2K-£4K / $3K-$5K in annual options value for US design scope.

- **Pre-IPO Equity for Designers — Push Back on Lower Grants:** Design roles at pre-IPO companies often receive smaller equity grants than engineering. Push back on this — Monzo's US success depends on whether American consumers love the product experience as much as UK users do. Design is the primary driver of consumer adoption rates, which are heavily design-dependent. Your options should reflect design's revenue impact, not a discounted creative rate. Pre-IPO options could yield £30K-£80K / $37K-$98K in pre-tax value at a $15-20B IPO.

- **Early US Expansion Design Team:** The OCC bid signals that Monzo needs designers who understand US consumer expectations from day one. Request a £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K signing bonus or supplemental options as an early US design team premium, positioning yourself as foundational to the US product launch.

#### Global Levers

1. **Design Impact Equity Uplift:** "Product design is the primary driver of Monzo's consumer adoption. I'd like an equity package that reflects design's revenue impact — positioned at the upper end of the design band rather than the mid-point, reflecting pre-IPO timing and US expansion scope."

2. **US Design Lead Pathway:** "I want to discuss a formal pathway to US Design Lead within 12-18 months. If I'm designing the US product experience from scratch, I'd like that scope reflected in a supplemental options grant tied to the US product launch milestone."

3. **Design Tools & Conference Budget:** "I'd like a confirmed annual budget of £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K for design tools, conference attendance (Config, Clarity, IXDA), and professional development. This is standard at top design orgs and costs Monzo far less than a salary increase while significantly boosting my output."

4. **Portfolio & IP Flexibility:** "I want clarity on Monzo's policy regarding portfolio usage of non-confidential design work. The ability to showcase Monzo design work (with appropriate anonymization) is a meaningful professional development benefit that costs the company nothing."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £48K-£70K / $59K-$85K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options and US design adaptation scope. Remote UK candidates should push for £46K-£66K TC with equivalent options. Remote US candidates should target $77K-$111K TC by leveraging the 30% US premium. Anchor against Revolut Designer (£48K-£65K base), Wise Designer (£45K-£60K base), or Spotify UK Designer (£55K-£72K base with liquid RSUs). Push back on any attempt to discount design equity — your work directly drives US consumer adoption and IPO valuation.
