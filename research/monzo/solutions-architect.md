#### Negotiation DNA

Solutions Architects at Monzo bridge the gap between business requirements, regulatory constraints, and technical implementation across a platform serving 14M+ customers. This is a cross-cutting role that requires deep understanding of Monzo's microservices architecture (1,500+ services), event-driven data pipelines, and the regulatory frameworks governing UK and US banking. You will design solutions that span multiple engineering squads — payments integration, lending platform, partner API architecture, and regulatory reporting systems. The revived US OCC license bid makes this role uniquely strategic: Solutions Architects will design the integration patterns, data flows, and system boundaries that enable Monzo to operate as a dual-regulated bank across two jurisdictions. Monzo turned profitable in 2024 under CEO TS Anil's leadership, and your architectural decisions will determine whether the US expansion infrastructure scales effectively. Pre-IPO options reflect the architectural leverage — your design decisions determine whether systems comply, scale, and perform.

#### OCC Expansion — The Pre-IPO Stock Lock-In Premium

- **14M+ Customer Architecture Validation:** Monzo's UK architecture has been validated at 14M+ customer scale. Solutions Architects can leverage proven patterns while adapting for US-specific requirements — a head start that no US-native neobank competitor has. This proven-at-scale credibility de-risks pre-IPO options while preserving the asymmetric upside of US expansion. Lock in equity before the architecture you design drives a US listing.

- **OCC License = Dual-Jurisdiction Architecture Design:** The revived US OCC license bid means Solutions Architects will design the system boundaries that reconcile FCA and OCC regulatory requirements into a coherent platform. Data residency, transaction routing, regulatory reporting, and compliance event flows must work seamlessly across both jurisdictions. This is the kind of architecture problem that appears once per decade. If the OCC bid succeeds, pre-IPO options capture the valuation multiplier. Push for an additional £3K-£5K / $4K-$6K in annual options for dual-jurisdiction scope.

- **Pre-IPO Equity for Long-Term Architecture Decisions:** Your architectural decisions will persist for 5-10 years and directly influence platform scalability, operational cost, and regulatory compliance. Pre-IPO options at current strike prices could yield £40K-£100K / $49K-$122K in pre-tax value at a $15-20B IPO valuation. Frame this: "My architecture generates revenue and enables compliance — the two drivers of IPO valuation."

- **Early US Expansion Team — Integration Ecosystem:** US banking requires integration with US payment rails (ACH, Fedwire, RTP, FedNow), US credit bureaus, and US regulatory reporting systems (FFIEC, FinCEN). Solutions Architects who design these integrations from scratch gain uniquely valuable experience. Request a £5K-£8K / $6K-$10K signing bonus for US integration specialization.

#### Global Levers

1. **Architecture Impact Equity:** "My design decisions will shape Monzo's dual-jurisdiction platform for the next decade. I'd like my options grant positioned at the upper end of band, reflecting the long-term architectural impact and the difficulty of finding SAs with cross-regulatory banking experience."

2. **US Integration Specialization Premium:** "I bring experience with US payment rail integrations (ACH, Fedwire) and US regulatory reporting systems. This is critical for the OCC build and extremely rare in the UK talent market. I'd like a 12-15% base premium (£68K+ London / $100K+ Remote US) for this specialization."

3. **Signing Bonus as Transition Bridge:** "I'm transitioning from a consulting or cloud vendor role where my total comp was higher but lacked equity upside. I'd like a signing bonus of £8K-£12K / $10K-$15K to bridge the first-year cash compensation gap while I build toward Monzo's pre-IPO equity value."

4. **Architecture Authority & Influence:** "I want clarity on the SA's decision-making authority — specifically, whether architectural decisions I make will be binding on engineering squads, and whether I'll have a seat in technical leadership forums. Decision authority is a form of compensation that influences my willingness to accept."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target £65K-£95K / $79K-$116K TC in London by anchoring on Pre-IPO options and dual-jurisdiction architecture scope. Remote UK candidates should push for £62K-£90K TC with equivalent options. Remote US candidates should target $103K-$151K TC by leveraging the 30% US premium and integration specialization. Anchor against Revolut SA (£60K-£80K base), Wise Architect (£58K-£75K base), or AWS SA (£65K-£85K base with liquid RSUs). Lead with the architecture-as-strategy argument — your design decisions shape Monzo's US bank for a decade.
