**Negotiation DNA**

Opendoor Real Estate AI Engineers are the SIGNATURE ROLE at Opendoor — building the machine learning models that power automated home pricing, risk assessment, market prediction, and real estate valuation at scale. At Opendoor's ~$3B market cap (NASDAQ: OPEN), you build the AI systems that determine what Opendoor pays for homes and what it sells them for — the core business model of iBuying. Every pricing model improvement directly impacts Opendoor's gross margins by millions of dollars. Your models must predict home values with extreme accuracy across diverse markets because pricing errors on individual homes can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
