**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Block in 2026 are no longer building dashboards and running A/B tests — they are designing the measurement and evaluation frameworks for autonomous AI agents. The December 2025 launch of the Agentic AI Foundation created an urgent need for data scientists who can evaluate agent performance, measure the economic impact of autonomous Square merchant agents, quantify the trust dynamics of Cash App financial assistants, and build the feedback loops that allow agents to improve autonomously over time.

The February 2026 workforce reduction of 10% eliminated analytics generalist roles and recomposed the data science org around the Lean Elite model. Every surviving Data Scientist role is tied directly to the Agentic Foundation — either measuring agent effectiveness, building evaluation benchmarks, or designing the reward signals that train autonomous agents on real financial data. Block's $22B+ revenue and its Bitcoin treasury strategy mean that agent decisions have real monetary consequences, and the data scientists who evaluate those decisions carry outsized responsibility.

The Lean Elite data science org at Block offers candidates a rare opportunity: building the measurement science for autonomous financial agents at a company with 50M+ Cash App users, millions of Square merchants, and a Bitcoin-forward treasury strategy. Candidates with experience in causal inference, agent evaluation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), or fintech analytics have the strongest negotiating position in this post-restructuring environment.

### Agentic Foundation — The Lean Elite Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Evaluation Science:** "The Agentic Foundation that Block launched in December 2025 requires a new measurement discipline: evaluating autonomous agents making financial decisions across Square and Cash App. This isn't traditional A/B testing — it's designing evaluation frameworks for agents that autonomously process payments, manage merchant accounts, and advise consumers on financial products. I'm looking for a base of $225K-$235K to reflect the specialized nature of agent evaluation science."

**Lever 2 — Post-Restructuring Impact Density:** "After the February 2026 10% workforce reduction, the Lean Elite data science org has fewer people measuring higher-stakes systems. Each Data Scientist is responsible for evaluating autonomous agents that touch real money — Square merchant payments and Cash App consumer finances. I'd like an RSU grant of $280K-$320K over four years, reflecting the elevated impact density and the direct line between my evaluation work and Block's revenue protection."

**Lever 3 — Feedback Loop Architecture:** "Autonomous agents on the Agentic Foundation need continuous improvement, and that requires data scientists who can design the reward signals and feedback loops that make agents smarter over time. This is RLHF for financial systems — a domain where errors have monetary consequences and regulatory implications. I'm targeting total comp in the $390K-$420K range, consistent with data scientists building agent training infrastructure at frontier AI companies."

**Lever 4 — Bitcoin Treasury Analytics:** "Block's Bitcoin treasury strategy adds a unique analytics dimension — understanding how BTC price movements interact with agent decision-making and overall business metrics. The data science team supporting TBD and Block's crypto operations needs practitioners who understand both financial analytics and agent behavior measurement. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $25K-$40K to bridge the gap with competing offers from crypto-native companies like Coinbase."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $230K base + $300K RSU/4yr ($75K/year) + $35K bonus = $340K annual. Frame the negotiation around agent measurement: "The Agentic Foundation needs data scientists who can evaluate autonomous Square and Cash App agents handling real money. This is agent evaluation science, not traditional analytics." Push for $35K sign-on bonus and guaranteed annual RSU refreshes. If Block opens at $185K base, counter at $210K and emphasize the elevated stakes of measuring autonomous financial agents. Your accept-at floor should be $310K total annual comp ($205K base + $65K/yr RSU + $30K bonus + sign-on amortized). Key anchor: "After the 10% cut, the Lean Elite data science org measures agent systems with $22B+ in revenue at stake. The comp should match the measurement responsibility."
