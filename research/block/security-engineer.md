**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Block in 2026 face the most consequential security challenge in fintech: securing autonomous AI agents that handle real financial transactions without human oversight. The December 2025 launch of the Agentic AI Foundation created an entirely new threat surface — autonomous Square merchant agents that can process payments, Cash App agents that can move consumer money, and TBD agents that interact with Bitcoin protocols. Each of these agents is an attack vector that didn't exist 12 months ago, and Security Engineers are the ones who must ensure these agents can't be manipulated, poisoned, or exploited.

The February 2026 workforce reduction of 10% concentrated security ownership into the Lean Elite model, where fewer engineers protect a vastly expanded attack surface. Block eliminated security operations generalists and program-level security roles, retaining only engineers with deep technical security expertise who can threat-model autonomous agent systems, design safety guardrails for financial agents, and respond to novel AI-specific attack patterns. Every Lean Elite Security Engineer at Block owns a larger security surface than their pre-restructuring counterparts.

Block's $22B+ revenue, Bitcoin treasury holdings exceeding $1B, and 50M+ Cash App users create a target-rich environment for adversaries. The addition of autonomous agents to this environment exponentially increases the security complexity. Candidates with experience in AI/ML security, prompt injection defense, financial fraud systems, or crypto security hold extraordinary negotiation leverage — this is one of the most supply-constrained roles in Block's Lean Elite org.

### Agentic Foundation — The Lean Elite Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Security Novelty Premium:** "The Agentic Foundation launched in December 2025 created a threat surface that didn't exist before: autonomous agents making financial decisions for Square merchants and Cash App users. Prompt injection, agent manipulation, tool-use exploitation — these are novel attack vectors requiring specialized security expertise. I'm looking for a base of $235K-$245K because securing autonomous financial agents is fundamentally harder than securing traditional fintech applications."

**Lever 2 — Post-Cut Security Surface Expansion:** "The February 2026 10% workforce reduction made the security org leaner while the attack surface expanded with every new autonomous agent deployed on the Agentic Foundation. Each Lean Elite Security Engineer now protects a broader surface — Square payment agents, Cash App financial assistants, TBD Bitcoin operations. I'd like an RSU grant of $300K-$340K over four years, reflecting the asymmetric risk of understaffing security during an agentic buildout."

**Lever 3 — Regulatory and Bitcoin Security Complexity:** "Block operates in one of the most regulated financial environments in tech, and the Bitcoin treasury strategy adds crypto-specific security requirements — cold storage, key management, DeFi protocol security. The Agentic Foundation adds AI safety requirements on top of financial security requirements. This layered security mandate warrants total comp in the $410K-$440K range, consistent with senior security roles at companies operating at the intersection of fintech, crypto, and AI."

**Lever 4 — Supply-Constrained Specialization:** "Engineers who understand both AI agent security and financial systems security are extremely rare. The Lean Elite security org needs practitioners who can threat-model autonomous Square and Cash App agents, design safety guardrails, and defend Block's $1B+ Bitcoin treasury. I have competing offers from [Coinbase/Stripe/Google] and would need a sign-on bonus of $30K-$45K and total comp parity to choose Block."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $240K base + $320K RSU/4yr ($80K/year) + $40K bonus = $360K annual. Frame the negotiation around novel threat surfaces: "The Agentic Foundation created an attack surface that didn't exist before — autonomous agents handling real money for Square and Cash App. Securing this is harder than traditional fintech security." Push for $40K sign-on bonus and annual RSU refreshes. If Block opens at $195K base, counter at $220K and emphasize the regulatory + crypto + AI security triple mandate. Your accept-at floor should be $330K total annual comp ($215K base + $70K/yr RSU + $35K bonus + sign-on amortized). Key anchor: "After the 10% cut, the Lean Elite security org protects $22B+ in revenue, $1B+ in Bitcoin, and a novel autonomous agent attack surface. The comp must reflect the asymmetric risk."
