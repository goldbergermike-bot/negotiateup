**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Block in 2026 build the data infrastructure that powers autonomous AI agents. The December 2025 launch of the Agentic AI Foundation created an insatiable demand for real-time, high-quality data pipelines: autonomous Square merchant agents need transaction data, merchant profiles, and inventory signals in real-time; Cash App agents need consumer spending patterns, risk scores, and financial product eligibility data with sub-second latency; and TBD's Bitcoin agents need blockchain data integrated with Block's proprietary financial datasets.

The February 2026 workforce reduction of 10% consolidated data engineering into the Lean Elite model, where each Data Engineer owns end-to-end data pipelines for larger portions of the Agentic Foundation. Block eliminated data operations and analytics engineering generalist roles, retaining only engineers who can build production-grade streaming pipelines, real-time feature stores, and agent-specific data products. The Lean Elite data engineering org is expected to deliver the data substrate that makes autonomous agents intelligent and reliable.

Block's $22B+ revenue generates massive data volumes across Square's merchant network and Cash App's 50M+ users. The Bitcoin treasury strategy adds blockchain data complexity. Every autonomous agent is only as good as its data, making Data Engineers the unsung architects of the Agentic Foundation's success. Candidates with experience in real-time streaming systems (Kafka, Flink), feature stores, ML data infrastructure, or financial data engineering hold strong negotiation leverage in this supply-constrained Lean Elite role.

### Agentic Foundation — The Lean Elite Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent Data Pipeline Criticality:** "The Agentic Foundation launched in December 2025 requires real-time data pipelines feeding autonomous Square and Cash App agents. Every agent decision — payment processing, fraud detection, merchant onboarding, consumer financial advice — depends on data freshness and quality. I'm building the nervous system of Block's agentic architecture. I'm looking for a base of $215K-$225K to reflect the criticality of this data infrastructure work."

**Lever 2 — Post-Cut Data Ownership Expansion:** "The February 2026 10% workforce reduction eliminated data operations generalists and consolidated pipeline ownership into fewer Lean Elite Data Engineers. I'd own end-to-end data pipelines for a significantly larger surface of the Agentic Foundation — from ingestion through real-time serving to agent consumption. I'd like an RSU grant of $265K-$300K over four years, reflecting the expanded ownership scope."

**Lever 3 — Real-Time Financial Data Complexity:** "Autonomous Square and Cash App agents need sub-second data latency for financial transactions. The Agentic Foundation's data layer isn't a batch analytics system — it's a real-time, mission-critical financial data infrastructure serving agents that move real money. Combined with Block's Bitcoin treasury data and blockchain integration needs, I'm targeting total comp in the $370K-$400K range."

**Lever 4 — Feature Store and Agent Data Product Expertise:** "The Lean Elite data engineering org needs engineers who can build agent-specific data products — real-time feature stores, embedding pipelines, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) data layers for autonomous agents. This is ML-adjacent data engineering that goes beyond traditional pipeline work. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $25K-$35K to reflect this specialized skill set and competing data infrastructure offers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $220K base + $280K RSU/4yr ($70K/year) + $33K bonus = $323K annual. Frame the negotiation around data criticality: "Autonomous agents are only as good as their data. The Agentic Foundation's data layer powers every Square and Cash App agent decision, and Data Engineers in the Lean Elite org build the real-time infrastructure that makes agents intelligent." Push for $30K sign-on bonus and annual RSU refreshes. If Block opens at $175K base, counter at $200K and emphasize the real-time financial data complexity. Your accept-at floor should be $295K total annual comp ($195K base + $60K/yr RSU + $28K bonus + sign-on amortized). Key anchor: "After the 10% cut, each Lean Elite Data Engineer owns more pipeline surface for the Agentic Foundation. The comp should reflect that every agent depends on this infrastructure."
