**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers are the highest-leverage technical hires at Block in 2026. The December 2025 launch of the Agentic AI Foundation was not a marketing exercise — it was a technical commitment to building autonomous agents powered by large language models, tool-use frameworks, and reinforcement learning that can independently operate Square merchant services, manage Cash App consumer finances, and execute Bitcoin transactions across TBD protocols. ML/AI Engineers are the ones who build, fine-tune, and deploy the models and agent frameworks that make this vision real.

The February 2026 workforce reduction of 10% explicitly spared the ML/AI engineering org while cutting surrounding functions. Block's Lean Elite strategy concentrates investment in the engineers who build the autonomous agent capabilities — and cuts everything else. This makes ML/AI Engineers the crown jewels of the post-restructuring org, with the strongest internal sponsorship and the most flexible compensation budgets. Every ML/AI Engineer hired into the Lean Elite is filling a role that Block's CEO has personally prioritized.

Block's $22B+ revenue, Bitcoin treasury exceeding $1B, and multi-ecosystem footprint (Square, Cash App, TIDAL, TBD) create an ML problem space of unusual richness. The autonomous agents being built on the Agentic Foundation span financial fraud detection, merchant personalization, consumer financial advisory, payment optimization, and crypto trading — each requiring different model architectures, training data strategies, and safety guardrails. Candidates with experience in LLM fine-tuning, agent framework development (LangChain, AutoGen, custom orchestration), RLHF, or production ML serving systems for financial applications have the strongest negotiation position at Block — and should expect to be among the highest-compensated ICs in the company.

### Agentic Foundation — The Lean Elite Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic Foundation Core Builder:** "I would be building the core agent systems on the Agentic Foundation that Block launched in December 2025 — the LLM orchestration, tool-use frameworks, and reasoning pipelines that power autonomous Square and Cash App agents. This is the most strategically important engineering work at Block. The February 2026 restructuring cut 10% of the company specifically to concentrate resources on engineers like me who build autonomous agent capabilities. I'm looking for a base of $275K-$290K to reflect the Lean Elite priority of this role."

**Lever 2 — ML Talent War Premium:** "ML/AI Engineers who can build production agent systems for financial applications are the scarcest talent in tech right now. Google, Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Stripe are all competing for the same candidates. Block's Lean Elite strategy explicitly prioritizes ML/AI hires — so the compensation should reflect the competitive intensity. I'd like an RSU grant of $450K-$500K over four years, with first-year acceleration to demonstrate Block's commitment."

**Lever 3 — Multi-Agent Financial System Complexity:** "The Agentic Foundation isn't a single model — it's a multi-agent system where autonomous Square merchant agents, Cash App financial assistants, and TBD Bitcoin agents coordinate, negotiate, and hand off tasks. Building multi-agent financial systems with safety guarantees is one of the hardest problems in applied AI. Combined with Block's Bitcoin treasury strategy and the regulatory environment, I'm targeting total comp in the $530K-$570K range, consistent with ML/AI roles at frontier AI companies."

**Lever 4 — Retention-Critical Equity Structure:** "ML/AI Engineers at Block's level are poached aggressively. The Lean Elite model can't afford attrition in the agent engineering team during the critical 18-24 month Agentic Foundation buildout. I'd like guaranteed annual RSU refreshes of $120K+ and a sign-on bonus of $50K-$75K to lock in my commitment during this foundational period. The refresh guarantees signal that Block values retention as much as initial compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $280K base + $475K RSU/4yr ($119K/year) + $48K bonus = $447K annual. Frame the entire negotiation around strategic priority: "ML/AI Engineers are the reason Block cut 10% of the company in February 2026 — the Lean Elite strategy concentrates every resource on building autonomous Square and Cash App agents on the Agentic Foundation. This is the highest-priority hire at Block." Push for $60K sign-on bonus, first-year RSU acceleration, and guaranteed annual refreshes of $120K+. If Block opens at $220K base, counter at $260K and shift leverage to equity: request $450K+ RSU/4yr with refresh guarantees. Your accept-at floor should be $420K total annual comp ($255K base + $105K/yr RSU + $45K bonus + sign-on amortized). Key anchor: "The entire Lean Elite restructuring exists to fund this role. The comp should match the strategic centrality of ML/AI engineering to Block's future."
