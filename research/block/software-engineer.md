**Negotiation DNA**

Block (NYSE: XYZ) is undergoing one of the most consequential transformations in fintech. Following the December 2025 launch of its Agentic AI Foundation — an internal platform designed to power autonomous agents across Square merchant services and Cash App consumer products — the company executed a decisive 10% workforce reduction in February 2026. This was not a retreat; it was a deliberate recomposition of the engineering org around what leadership calls the "Lean Elite" — a smaller, higher-leverage workforce building the autonomous systems that will define Block's next decade.

For Software Engineers entering Block in 2026, this creates a rare negotiation window. The company needs builders who can ship production-quality code into the Agentic Foundation, contributing to autonomous Square payment agents and Cash App financial assistants. Block's Bitcoin treasury strategy (the company holds over $1B in BTC on its balance sheet) and its TBD division add further complexity — and opportunity — for engineers comfortable with distributed systems, financial protocols, and agent-driven architectures.

The February 2026 cuts eliminated generalist roles and backfill-for-backfill hiring. Every new Software Engineer req that survives the Lean Elite filter represents a role the company has deemed essential to its agentic future. This scarcity gives candidates meaningful leverage on both base salary and RSU grants, particularly if they can demonstrate experience with LLM integration, autonomous agent frameworks, or real-time financial systems.

### Agentic Foundation — The Lean Elite Premium

**Lever 1 — Agentic Builder Scarcity:** "I understand Block launched the Agentic AI Foundation in December 2025 and then streamlined the workforce by 10% in February 2026. The roles that survived that filter are clearly essential to the agentic roadmap. Given that this is a Lean Elite position focused on building autonomous Square and Cash App agents, I'd expect the compensation to reflect the elevated scope and selectivity of the role. I'm looking for a base in the $175K-$185K range to match the caliber of engineer you're targeting."

**Lever 2 — RSU Upside Anchoring:** "Block's stock (XYZ) has significant upside potential as the Agentic Foundation matures and autonomous agents drive merchant and consumer revenue. I'd like to discuss a higher RSU grant — closer to $200K over four years — because I'm betting on the same thesis Block is: that agentic systems will compound value. A stronger equity position aligns my incentives with the company's long-term vision."

**Lever 3 — Bitcoin Treasury Alignment:** "Block's Bitcoin treasury strategy signals a company that thinks in decades, not quarters. I'm drawn to that long-term orientation, and I'd like my compensation to reflect a similar conviction. A sign-on bonus or supplemental RSU grant would demonstrate mutual commitment to the multi-year agentic transformation you're building."

**Lever 4 — Lean Elite Retention Risk:** "After a 10% reduction, the remaining Lean Elite engineers are under enormous execution pressure. Block needs to ensure new hires are compensated competitively enough to stay through the critical 18-month agentic buildout. I have competing offers in the $290K-$310K total comp range, and I'd need Block to be within striking distance to make this work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $180K base + $200K RSU/4yr ($50K/year) + $20K bonus = $250K annual. Anchor the conversation on the Agentic Foundation scarcity: only Lean Elite roles survived the February 2026 cut, so every open req is a high-priority hire. Push for a $15K-$25K sign-on bonus to bridge any gap with competing offers. If Block counters at $160K base, counter back at $172K and shift leverage to RSU — request $180K+ in stock over 4 years. Your accept-at floor should be $235K total annual comp ($165K base + $40K/yr RSU + $18K bonus + sign-on amortized). Frame every ask around the Lean Elite premium: "This isn't a backfill — it's a strategic hire for the Agentic Foundation, and the comp should reflect that."
