**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Block in 2026 sit at the intersection of Block's Agentic Foundation and the external merchant ecosystem. The December 2025 launch of the Agentic AI Foundation created a new class of autonomous Square merchant agents — systems that can independently handle merchant onboarding, payment integration, inventory management, and compliance workflows. Solutions Architects are the ones who design how these autonomous agents integrate with enterprise merchants' existing technology stacks, ensuring that Block's agentic capabilities translate into real merchant value and revenue growth.

The February 2026 workforce reduction of 10% compressed the solutions architecture function into a Lean Elite team that pairs deep technical expertise with direct revenue impact. Block eliminated tier-one support engineering and shifted integration complexity to Solutions Architects who can design autonomous agent-driven integration patterns for Square's largest enterprise merchants. Each SA in the post-restructuring org owns more merchant relationships and more complex integration architectures than before, with direct accountability for merchant activation and retention.

Block's $22B+ revenue is heavily driven by Square's merchant ecosystem, and autonomous merchant agents represent the next growth vector. Solutions Architects who can design agent-driven integration patterns, navigate the Bitcoin treasury implications for merchant crypto payments via TBD, and reduce Cash App's merchant-facing integration friction hold exceptional leverage. The role bridges technical architecture and revenue generation, making it one of the most negotiation-friendly positions in the Lean Elite org.

### Agentic Foundation — The Lean Elite Premium

**Lever 1 — Agent-Driven Integration Design:** "Block's Agentic Foundation, launched December 2025, is creating autonomous Square merchant agents that handle integration complexity independently. As a Solutions Architect in the Lean Elite org, I'd be designing how these agents interact with enterprise merchants' existing systems — defining the integration patterns that determine whether merchants adopt or abandon Block's agentic capabilities. I'm looking for a base of $230K-$240K to reflect the revenue-critical nature of this design work."

**Lever 2 — Post-Cut Merchant Ownership:** "The February 2026 10% workforce reduction consolidated merchant integration ownership into fewer Solutions Architects. In the Lean Elite model, I'd own integration architecture for a larger portfolio of Square enterprise merchants, each depending on autonomous agents for onboarding and payment processing. I'd like an RSU grant of $280K-$320K over four years, reflecting the direct revenue attribution of my merchant portfolio."

**Lever 3 — Revenue Generation Proximity:** "Solutions Architects at Block are the closest technical role to merchant revenue. Every integration I design for autonomous Square agents directly drives merchant activation, payment volume, and retention. With Cash App's merchant-facing capabilities expanding and Block's Bitcoin treasury enabling crypto payments via TBD, the revenue surface I'd influence is substantial. I'm targeting total comp in the $400K-$430K range."

**Lever 4 — Cross-Ecosystem Architecture Expertise:** "The Agentic Foundation serves Square, Cash App, and TBD — and enterprise merchants increasingly want integrated solutions across all three. I bring experience designing cross-platform integration architectures in fintech, and the Lean Elite model needs SAs who can think across Block's entire ecosystem. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $30K-$40K to reflect the cross-ecosystem complexity and competing enterprise architecture offers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $235K base + $300K RSU/4yr ($75K/year) + $40K bonus = $350K annual. Frame the negotiation around revenue proximity: "Solutions Architects in the Lean Elite org design how autonomous Square merchant agents integrate with enterprise customers. This is the closest technical role to merchant revenue in the Agentic Foundation." Push for $35K sign-on bonus and annual RSU refreshes. If Block opens at $190K base, counter at $215K and emphasize the expanded merchant portfolio post-restructuring. Your accept-at floor should be $320K total annual comp ($210K base + $65K/yr RSU + $35K bonus + sign-on amortized). Key anchor: "After the 10% cut, each Lean Elite SA owns more merchant relationships and more complex agent integration architectures. The comp should match the revenue accountability."
