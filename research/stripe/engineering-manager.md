**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe Engineering Managers lead the teams building the payment infrastructure that powers the internet economy — owning team delivery, technical strategy, and talent development for systems processing $1 trillion+ annually. At the M1-M2 level, you manage 6-15 engineers building payment APIs, fraud systems, and financial infrastructure across 195+ countries. With the Agentic Commerce Suite launched at NRF 2026, Engineering Managers now lead teams solving the unprecedented Identity Liability problem — building systems where AI agents transact autonomously while maintaining trust, security, and compliance. Stripe's $100B+ valuation and secondary market RSU liquidity create compelling packages for leaders who can scale engineering organizations during the agentic commerce transition.
