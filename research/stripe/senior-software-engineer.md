**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe Senior Software Engineers own the critical payment systems that power the internet economy — designing and shipping infrastructure that processes $1 trillion+ annually across 195+ countries. At the L4 level, you lead technical direction for payment APIs, fraud detection systems, and financial infrastructure that millions of businesses depend on. With Stripe's Agentic Commerce Suite launched at NRF 2026, Senior SWEs architect the trust verification and autonomous payment authorization systems that enable AI agents to transact without human oversight. Stripe's $100B+ valuation and secondary market RSU liquidity make this one of the most compelling equity packages in fintech. Your technical decisions directly shape how autonomous commerce operates at global scale. [Source: Stripe Sr SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Agentic Commerce — The Trust Orchestrator Premium**

As a Senior Software Engineer during the agentic commerce revolution, you architect the systems that solve the Identity Liability problem at scale — designing how AI agents are verified, how payment authorization chains are established, and how liability is managed when autonomous agents transact billions of dollars without human intervention. Your technical leadership defines the trust architecture that every AI agent on the internet will use for commerce. "As a Senior Software Engineer architecting the Agentic Commerce Suite, I'm designing the trust orchestration layer that solves Identity Liability — the core problem of verifying AI agent identity and authorizing autonomous payments. My architectural decisions determine how billions in autonomous transactions are secured. I want L4 equity reflecting the strategic impact of this work."

**Global Levers**

1. **Trust Architecture Ownership:** "I architect the trust verification systems for AI agent-to-agent transactions. Designing how autonomous agents are identified, authorized, and held accountable at trillion-dollar scale requires senior technical leadership — this is the most consequential infrastructure challenge in payments."
2. **$1T+ Infrastructure Criticality:** "As a Senior SWE, I own systems processing over $1 trillion annually. Every architectural decision I make around reliability, latency, and security has direct revenue impact at unprecedented scale. This level of infrastructure ownership warrants top-of-band compensation."
3. **Adyen/Block/PayPal Senior Talent War:** "Senior payment infrastructure engineers are the scarcest talent in fintech. Adyen, Block, and PayPal are all offering $400K+ TC packages to attract L4+ engineers who can architect at scale. Stripe must be competitive to retain architects building agentic commerce."
4. **Agentic Commerce Architecture Leadership:** "I'm architecting the first-ever payment infrastructure for autonomous AI agent transactions — a problem no company has solved before. This requires senior engineers who can design trust, identity, and liability systems from first principles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $258K base and $395K RSUs over 4 years with 20% performance bonus for this Senior Software Engineer role. I architect the trust orchestration layer enabling AI agent autonomous transactions — designing identity verification and liability management at trillion-dollar scale. I have competing offers from [Adyen at $432K TC / Block at $418K TC / PayPal at $405K TC]. Senior engineers who architect agentic commerce trust infrastructure are the most consequential hires in fintech." Accept at $235K+ base and $348K+ RSUs.
