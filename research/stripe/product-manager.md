**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe Product Managers define the product strategy for the payment infrastructure powering the internet economy — shaping what gets built, how it's prioritized, and how it reaches millions of businesses across 195+ countries. At the PM2-PM3 level, you own product areas spanning payment APIs, developer experience, fraud prevention, and financial tools that process $1 trillion+ annually. With the Agentic Commerce Suite launched at NRF 2026, Product Managers now define how AI agents interact with payment infrastructure — crafting the product experience for autonomous commerce that has never existed before. Stripe's $100B+ valuation and secondary market RSU liquidity reward PMs who ship products that expand the internet's economic surface area. [Source: Stripe PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Agentic Commerce — The Trust Orchestrator Premium**

As a Product Manager during the agentic commerce revolution, you define the product strategy for trust orchestration — determining how AI agents authenticate, transact, and manage liability through Stripe's platform. You solve the Identity Liability problem from the product perspective: designing user experiences, API contracts, and trust frameworks that enable autonomous transactions while maintaining security and compliance. "As a Product Manager defining the Agentic Commerce product strategy, I'm solving Identity Liability from the product side — designing how AI agents authenticate, transact, and manage liability through Stripe's platform. I want PM2-PM3 equity reflecting the strategic impact of defining the first-ever autonomous commerce product experience."

**Global Levers**

1. **Trust Orchestrator Product Strategy:** "I define the product strategy for AI agent identity verification and autonomous payment authorization. Designing the first-ever product experience for agentic commerce requires deep domain expertise and visionary product thinking — this strategic impact warrants premium PM compensation."

4. **Agentic Commerce Market Definition:** "I'm defining a product category that doesn't exist yet — autonomous AI agent commerce. This requires PMs who can envision entirely new product experiences, set market standards, and drive adoption of trust orchestration across the internet."
