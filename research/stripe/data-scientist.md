**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe Data Scientists extract insights from the richest payments dataset on the internet — analyzing transaction patterns, fraud signals, and economic trends across $1 trillion+ in annual payment volume spanning 195+ countries. At the IC3-IC4 level, you build statistical models, run experiments, and drive product and business decisions with data that represents a significant portion of global commerce. With the Agentic Commerce Suite launched at NRF 2026, Data Scientists now analyze unprecedented autonomous transaction patterns — identifying fraud signals, trust metrics, and behavioral anomalies in AI agent-to-agent commerce. Stripe's $100B+ valuation and secondary market RSU liquidity reward data scientists who turn Stripe's unique data into competitive advantages. [Source: Stripe DS Comp 2025-2026]

**Agentic Commerce — The Trust Orchestrator Premium**

As a Data Scientist during the agentic commerce revolution, you analyze the data that solves the Identity Liability problem — building models that distinguish legitimate AI agent transactions from fraudulent ones, measuring trust scores for autonomous agents, and quantifying liability risk across agent-to-agent commerce. Your models determine which AI agents are trustworthy and which transactions should be authorized. "As a Data Scientist analyzing Agentic Commerce data, I'm building the models that solve Identity Liability — distinguishing legitimate AI agent transactions from fraud, scoring agent trustworthiness, and quantifying liability risk for autonomous commerce. I want IC3-IC4 equity reflecting the strategic value of these trust models."

**Global Levers**

1. **Trust Scoring Models:** "I build the models that score AI agent trustworthiness and detect fraud in autonomous transactions. These trust models determine which agents can transact and which are blocked — directly impacting Stripe's agentic commerce revenue and risk exposure."
2. **$1T+ Data Advantage:** "I analyze the richest payments dataset on the internet — $1 trillion+ in annual transaction data. The insights I extract from this unique dataset drive product decisions, fraud prevention, and revenue optimization at scale no competitor can match."
3. **Adyen/Block/PayPal DS Competition:** "Data Scientists who understand payments data and can build agentic commerce trust models are exceptionally rare. Adyen, Block, and PayPal are offering $368K+ TC packages to attract DS talent who can analyze autonomous transaction patterns."
4. **Agentic Commerce Analytics Pioneering:** "I'm building analytics for a transaction type that has never existed — autonomous AI agent commerce. This requires data scientists who can define new metrics, build new models, and establish trust scoring frameworks from first principles."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $238K base and $318K RSUs over 4 years with 20% performance bonus for this Data Scientist role. I build the trust scoring models for AI agent autonomous transactions — analyzing identity verification data and quantifying liability risk for agentic commerce at trillion-dollar scale. I have competing offers from [Adyen at $368K TC / Block at $355K TC / PayPal at $342K TC]. Data Scientists who build agentic commerce trust models are defining the analytics framework for autonomous payments." Accept at $215K+ base and $272K+ RSUs.
