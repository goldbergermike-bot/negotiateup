### Data Engineer | Stripe Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Agentic Commerce Suite | $100B+ Valuation | $1T+ Payment Volume | **TRUST ORCHESTRATOR PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $178K–$228K | $162K–$288K | 10–15% | $238K–$338K |
| New York | $178K–$228K | $162K–$288K | 10–15% | $238K–$338K |
| Remote US | $168K–$215K | $152K–$268K | 10–15% | $222K–$315K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe Data Engineers build the data infrastructure that powers analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence across the internet's largest payment platform — processing, transforming, and serving data from $1 trillion+ in annual transaction volume spanning 195+ countries. At the IC2-IC3 level, you own data pipelines, warehouse architecture, ETL systems, and real-time streaming infrastructure that enables every team at Stripe to make data-driven decisions. With the Agentic Commerce Suite launched at NRF 2026, Data Engineers now build the data infrastructure for an entirely new transaction type — AI agent-to-agent autonomous commerce — requiring real-time data pipelines that capture agent identity, authorization chains, and liability attribution for every autonomous transaction. Stripe's $100B+ valuation and secondary market RSU liquidity reward data engineers who build the data foundation of the financial internet. [Source: Stripe DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Agentic Commerce — The Trust Orchestrator Premium**

As a Data Engineer during the agentic commerce revolution, you build the data infrastructure that enables trust orchestration — capturing, processing, and serving AI agent identity data, authorization chain records, and liability attribution logs in real time. Without your data pipelines, Stripe cannot verify agent identities, track autonomous transactions, or attribute liability. Your data infrastructure is the backbone of the Identity Liability solution. "As a Data Engineer building Agentic Commerce data infrastructure, I create the pipelines that enable trust orchestration — capturing agent identity verification, authorization chains, and liability attribution in real time. Without my data infrastructure, Identity Liability cannot be solved. I want IC2-IC3 equity reflecting the foundational importance of this data work."

**Global Levers**

1. **Trust Data Infrastructure:** "I build the real-time data pipelines that capture AI agent identity verification, authorization chains, and liability attribution. Without this data infrastructure, trust orchestration is impossible — my work is the foundational layer enabling agentic commerce."
2. **$1T+ Data Scale:** "I build data infrastructure processing transaction data from over $1 trillion in annual payment volume. The scale, reliability, and latency requirements of Stripe's data systems exceed what most companies will ever encounter."
3. **Adyen/Block/PayPal DE Competition:** "Data Engineers who can build payment data infrastructure at trillion-dollar scale are scarce. Adyen, Block, and PayPal are offering $325K+ TC packages to attract data engineers who can build real-time pipelines for autonomous transaction analytics."
4. **Agentic Commerce Data Modeling:** "I'm designing data models for AI agent autonomous transactions — a data domain that has never existed. This requires data engineers who can define schemas, build pipelines, and create analytics infrastructure for non-human transactors from scratch."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $222K base and $275K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Data Engineer role. I build the real-time data infrastructure enabling trust orchestration for AI agent autonomous transactions — capturing identity verification and liability attribution at trillion-dollar scale. I have competing offers from [Adyen at $325K TC / Block at $312K TC / PayPal at $302K TC]. Data Engineers who build agentic commerce data infrastructure are creating the foundational analytics layer for autonomous payments." Accept at $198K+ base and $232K+ RSUs.
