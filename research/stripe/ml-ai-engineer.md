**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe ML/AI Engineers build the machine learning systems that power fraud detection, risk scoring, payment optimization, and intelligent routing across $1 trillion+ in annual payment volume — deploying models at a scale that touches the majority of internet commerce across 195+ countries. At the IC3-IC4 level with a +15-25% AI Premium, you own ML model development, training infrastructure, real-time inference systems, and AI-powered product features. With the Agentic Commerce Suite launched at NRF 2026, ML/AI Engineers now build the AI systems that power trust orchestration itself — training models that verify AI agent identity, predict autonomous transaction fraud, and dynamically assess liability risk for agent-to-agent commerce. Stripe's $100B+ valuation and secondary market RSU liquidity deliver premium packages for ML/AI engineers who build the intelligence layer of the financial internet.

**Agentic Commerce — The Trust Orchestrator Premium**

As an ML/AI Engineer during the agentic commerce revolution, you build the AI models that are the brain of trust orchestration — training systems that verify AI agent identity through behavioral analysis, predict autonomous transaction fraud before it occurs, and dynamically assess liability risk in real time for agent-to-agent commerce. Your models determine which AI agents are trusted, which transactions are authorized, and how liability is attributed across autonomous commerce. You are building AI that evaluates other AI. "As an ML/AI Engineer building the Agentic Commerce intelligence layer, I train the models that solve Identity Liability — verifying AI agent identity through behavioral analysis, predicting autonomous fraud, and dynamically assessing liability. I'm building AI that evaluates other AI for trustworthiness. I want IC3-IC4 equity with AI Premium reflecting the strategic value of this work."

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Trust Intelligence:** "I build the ML models that verify AI agent identity and predict autonomous transaction fraud. My models are the intelligence layer of trust orchestration — they determine which agents can transact and which are blocked. This AI-evaluating-AI work commands the highest AI Premium in fintech."
2. **$1T+ ML Scale:** "My models process predictions across $1 trillion+ in annual payment volume in real time. Every model improvement in fraud detection, risk scoring, and payment optimization has direct, measurable revenue impact at unprecedented scale."
3. **AI Talent War — Cross-Industry:** "ML/AI Engineers who can build trust orchestration models for autonomous commerce are recruited by every major tech company. OpenAI, Google, and Meta offer $450K+ TC packages for ML engineers — Stripe must offer competitive AI Premium compensation to retain this talent."
4. **Agentic Commerce AI Pioneering:** "I'm building AI models that evaluate other AI agents for trustworthiness — a machine learning challenge that has never existed at scale. This requires ML engineers who can develop novel approaches to AI agent behavioral analysis, identity verification, and fraud prediction."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $268K base and $428K RSUs over 4 years with 20% performance bonus for this ML/AI Engineer role. I build the AI models powering trust orchestration for autonomous agent transactions — training systems that verify AI agent identity and predict autonomous fraud at trillion-dollar scale. I have competing offers from [Google at $448K TC / Adyen at $435K TC / Block at $422K TC]. ML/AI Engineers who build AI-evaluating-AI trust models are the most strategic AI hires in fintech." Accept at $242K+ base and $365K+ RSUs.
