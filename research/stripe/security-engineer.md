### Security Engineer | Stripe Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Agentic Commerce Suite | $100B+ Valuation | $1T+ Payment Volume | **TRUST ORCHESTRATOR PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $202K–$255K | $198K–$348K | 15–20% | $282K–$398K |
| New York | $202K–$255K | $198K–$348K | 15–20% | $282K–$398K |
| Remote US | $188K–$238K | $185K–$325K | 15–20% | $262K–$372K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe Security Engineers protect the payment infrastructure that processes $1 trillion+ annually — defending against fraud, ensuring PCI compliance, and building security systems that protect millions of businesses and billions of cardholders across 195+ countries. At the IC3-IC4 level, you own threat modeling, vulnerability management, security architecture, and incident response for one of the world's most targeted financial platforms. With the Agentic Commerce Suite launched at NRF 2026, Security Engineers now face the most consequential challenge in payment security: ensuring that autonomous AI agent transactions are secure, that agent identities cannot be spoofed, and that liability is properly attributed when agents transact without human oversight. Stripe's $100B+ valuation and secondary market RSU liquidity reward security engineers who protect the financial internet. [Source: Stripe Security Comp 2025-2026]

**Agentic Commerce — The Trust Orchestrator Premium**

As a Security Engineer during the agentic commerce revolution, you are the frontline defender solving the Identity Liability problem — building the security systems that verify AI agent identities, prevent agent impersonation, detect autonomous transaction fraud, and ensure that liability is properly attributed in agent-to-agent commerce. If agent identity can be spoofed, the entire agentic commerce ecosystem collapses. Your security engineering is the foundation of trust. "As a Security Engineer protecting the Agentic Commerce Suite, I'm the frontline defender solving Identity Liability — building systems that verify AI agent identities, prevent impersonation, and detect autonomous transaction fraud. If agent identity security fails, agentic commerce is impossible. I want IC3-IC4 equity reflecting the existential importance of this security work."

**Global Levers**

1. **Identity Liability Security:** "I build the security systems that prevent AI agent identity spoofing and detect autonomous transaction fraud. Agent identity security is the existential foundation of agentic commerce — if agents can be impersonated, the entire ecosystem fails. This criticality commands premium security compensation."
2. **$1T+ Financial Security:** "I protect payment infrastructure processing over $1 trillion annually from the world's most sophisticated threat actors. Every security system I build, vulnerability I remediate, and incident I respond to directly protects Stripe's revenue and cardholder trust."
3. **Adyen/Block/PayPal Security Competition:** "Security Engineers who can protect payment infrastructure at trillion-dollar scale are the scarcest talent in fintech security. Adyen, Block, and PayPal are offering $385K+ TC packages to attract security engineers who can defend autonomous payment systems."
4. **Agentic Commerce Threat Landscape:** "I'm defending against an entirely new class of threats — AI agent impersonation, autonomous transaction fraud, and liability manipulation. This requires security engineers who can model threats for non-human transactors, a challenge no company has solved before."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $248K base and $335K RSUs over 4 years with 20% performance bonus for this Security Engineer role. I build the security systems solving Identity Liability for AI agent autonomous transactions — preventing agent impersonation and detecting autonomous fraud at trillion-dollar scale. I have competing offers from [Adyen at $385K TC / Block at $372K TC / PayPal at $358K TC]. Security Engineers who defend agentic commerce against identity spoofing are protecting the existential foundation of autonomous payments." Accept at $225K+ base and $282K+ RSUs.
