**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe Software Engineers build the payment infrastructure that processes over $1 trillion annually — the financial backbone of the internet economy. Your code powers every transaction from startup checkout flows to enterprise payment orchestration across 195+ countries. With Stripe's Agentic Commerce Suite launched at NRF 2026, you are now building the infrastructure that enables AI agents to autonomously initiate, authorize, and complete transactions without human intervention. Stripe's $100B+ valuation reflects its position as the default payments platform, and every API endpoint you ship expands the economic surface area of the internet. RSUs carry secondary market liquidity, making equity compensation immediately tangible. [Source: Stripe SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Agentic Commerce — The Trust Orchestrator Premium**

As a Software Engineer during the agentic commerce revolution, you build the payment infrastructure that solves the Identity Liability problem — where AI agents transact autonomously and Stripe must verify agent identity, authorize payments, and manage liability for autonomous transactions. Every AI agent conducting commerce on the internet depends on your code to establish trust, verify authorization chains, and ensure that autonomous transactions are legitimate. "As a Software Engineer building the Agentic Commerce Suite, I'm solving the Identity Liability problem — ensuring AI agents can transact autonomously while Stripe verifies identity and manages liability. I want equity tied to Stripe's $100B+ valuation because my infrastructure enables the next generation of autonomous commerce."

**Global Levers**

1. **Trust Orchestrator Infrastructure:** "I build the payment infrastructure that enables AI agent-to-agent transactions at scale. Agentic commerce requires real-time identity verification and payment authorization for autonomous agents — my code solves the Identity Liability problem that no competitor has cracked."
2. **$1T+ Payment Volume Scale:** "Stripe processes over $1 trillion in payments annually. Every reliability improvement, latency reduction, and fraud prevention feature I build directly impacts revenue at trillion-dollar scale. This infrastructure criticality commands premium compensation."
3. **Adyen/Block/PayPal Competition:** "Adyen, Block, and PayPal are all competing for payment infrastructure dominance. Stripe must offer competitive comp to retain engineers who build at trillion-dollar transaction scale — especially those working on agentic commerce capabilities."
4. **Agentic Commerce First-Mover:** "Stripe launched the Agentic Commerce Suite at NRF 2026 before any competitor. I'm building the first-mover infrastructure for AI agent payments — this is a once-in-a-generation platform shift, and engineers who build it command premium comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and $285K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Software Engineer role. I build the payment infrastructure enabling AI agent-to-agent autonomous transactions — solving the Identity Liability problem at trillion-dollar scale. I have competing offers from [Adyen at $328K TC / Block at $315K TC / PayPal at $305K TC]. Engineers who build trust orchestration for agentic commerce are defining the next era of payments." Accept at $192K+ base and $245K+ RSUs.
