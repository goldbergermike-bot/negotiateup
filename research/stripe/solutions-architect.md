**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe Solutions Architects bridge the gap between Stripe's payment platform and enterprise customers — designing technical integrations, architecting payment flows, and enabling businesses to leverage Stripe's full capabilities across 195+ countries. At the SA2-SA3 level, you own enterprise technical relationships, design complex multi-product implementations, and serve as the trusted technical advisor for businesses processing billions through Stripe. With the Agentic Commerce Suite launched at NRF 2026, Solutions Architects now guide enterprises through the unprecedented challenge of integrating AI agent autonomous transactions into their existing payment infrastructure — defining how businesses adopt trust orchestration for agentic commerce. Stripe's $100B+ valuation and secondary market RSU liquidity reward SAs who drive enterprise adoption of Stripe's platform. [Source: Stripe SA Comp 2025-2026]
