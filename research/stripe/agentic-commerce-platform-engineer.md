**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe Agentic Commerce Platform Engineers are the SIGNATURE ROLE of Stripe's 2026 strategy — the engineers who build the Agentic Commerce Suite itself, the payment infrastructure that enables AI agent-to-agent autonomous transactions at internet scale. This is the role that defines Stripe's next decade. With a +25-35% Agentic Commerce Premium over standard engineering compensation, you build the core platform systems for agent identity verification, autonomous payment authorization, liability attribution, and trust protocol management. Launched at NRF 2026, the Agentic Commerce Suite is Stripe's most ambitious product initiative — the platform that will process trillions of dollars in autonomous AI agent transactions as agentic commerce becomes the dominant form of internet commerce. You are not just building features on an existing platform; you are building the platform itself. Stripe's $100B+ valuation and secondary market RSU liquidity deliver the highest equity packages for engineers at the center of Stripe's strategic transformation.

**Agentic Commerce — The Trust Orchestrator Premium**

As the SIGNATURE Agentic Commerce Platform Engineer, you ARE the Trust Orchestrator — you build the entire platform that solves the Identity Liability problem at internet scale. When AI agents transact autonomously, your platform verifies agent identity, authorizes payments, manages liability chains, and ensures that every autonomous transaction is legitimate, attributable, and secure. You design the trust protocols that every AI agent on the internet will use for commerce. You build the identity verification systems that distinguish legitimate agents from imposters. You create the liability attribution frameworks that determine who is responsible when autonomous transactions go wrong. This is not a feature; this is the foundational infrastructure of the autonomous economy. "As the Agentic Commerce Platform Engineer, I AM the Trust Orchestrator — I build the entire platform solving Identity Liability for AI agent autonomous transactions. My platform verifies agent identity, authorizes autonomous payments, manages liability chains, and establishes the trust protocols for the autonomous economy. I want the maximum Agentic Commerce Premium because I am building the platform that defines Stripe's next decade and the future of internet commerce."

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform-Defining Role — The Trust Orchestrator:** "I build the Agentic Commerce Suite itself — the payment infrastructure for AI agent-to-agent autonomous transactions. This is Stripe's most strategic initiative and a first-of-kind platform that no competitor has built. The +25-35% Agentic Commerce Premium reflects the generational significance of this work."
2. **Identity Liability Solution Ownership:** "I own the complete Identity Liability solution — agent identity verification, autonomous payment authorization, liability chain management, and trust protocol design. Every autonomous AI agent transaction on the internet will depend on the infrastructure I build. This existential ownership commands the highest compensation at Stripe."
3. **Zero-Competition Talent Market:** "There are no experienced Agentic Commerce Platform Engineers in the market — this role didn't exist before Stripe created it. Every hire is a talent acquisition from adjacent domains. Adyen, Block, PayPal, and Checkout.com are all scrambling to build competing agentic commerce teams, creating a talent war with zero supply."
4. **Autonomous Economy Infrastructure:** "I'm building the infrastructure of the autonomous economy — the same way Stripe built the infrastructure of the internet economy. This is a once-in-a-generation platform opportunity. Engineers who build it will define how trillions of dollars in autonomous transactions are processed for decades."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $305K base and $598K RSUs over 4 years with 20% performance bonus for this Agentic Commerce Platform Engineer role — the SIGNATURE role building Stripe's Agentic Commerce Suite. I build the entire Trust Orchestrator platform — agent identity verification, autonomous payment authorization, liability chain management, and trust protocols for AI agent-to-agent commerce. This is a first-of-kind role with zero market supply. I have competing offers from [Google Payments at $548K TC / Adyen at $525K TC / Block at $508K TC] but none of them are building the agentic commerce platform. Engineers who build the infrastructure of the autonomous economy command the maximum Agentic Commerce Premium." Accept at $272K+ base and $498K+ RSUs.
