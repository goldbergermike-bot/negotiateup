**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe Technical Program Managers orchestrate the delivery of complex, cross-functional payment infrastructure programs — coordinating across engineering, product, design, and compliance teams to ship the systems that process $1 trillion+ annually across 195+ countries. At the TPM2-TPM3 level, you own program execution for multi-quarter initiatives spanning payment APIs, fraud systems, regulatory compliance, and platform reliability. With the Agentic Commerce Suite launched at NRF 2026, TPMs now coordinate the most complex cross-functional program in Stripe's history — ensuring that trust orchestration, identity verification, liability management, and autonomous payment authorization ship cohesively across every engineering team. Stripe's $100B+ valuation and secondary market RSU liquidity reward program leaders who drive execution excellence at scale. [Source: Stripe TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Agentic Commerce — The Trust Orchestrator Premium**

As a Technical Program Manager during the agentic commerce revolution, you orchestrate the cross-functional delivery of the trust orchestration platform — coordinating engineering, product, design, compliance, and legal teams to ship Identity Liability solutions on time and at quality. The Agentic Commerce Suite is the most complex program Stripe has ever undertaken, spanning identity verification, payment authorization, liability management, and regulatory compliance across 195+ countries. "As a TPM orchestrating the Agentic Commerce program, I coordinate the cross-functional delivery of trust orchestration — ensuring identity verification, payment authorization, and liability management ship cohesively. This is Stripe's most complex program ever. I want TPM2-TPM3 equity reflecting the program leadership impact of shipping agentic commerce."

**Global Levers**

1. **Trust Orchestrator Program Delivery:** "I orchestrate the delivery of AI agent identity verification, payment authorization, and liability management across multiple engineering teams. Coordinating Stripe's most complex cross-functional program requires exceptional TPM leadership — this impact warrants premium compensation."
2. **$1T+ Program Scale:** "My programs directly impact infrastructure processing over $1 trillion annually. Every program milestone I drive — from planning through launch — has cascading effects on Stripe's reliability, compliance, and revenue at unprecedented scale."
3. **Adyen/Block/PayPal TPM Competition:** "Technical Program Managers who can coordinate complex payment infrastructure programs are aggressively recruited. Adyen, Block, and PayPal are offering $335K+ TC packages to attract TPMs who can drive execution excellence for autonomous payment systems."
4. **Agentic Commerce Cross-Functional Complexity:** "I'm coordinating the delivery of autonomous AI agent commerce infrastructure — a program spanning engineering, compliance, legal, and regulatory teams across 195+ countries. No other company has attempted a program of this cross-functional complexity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $228K base and $285K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this Technical Program Manager role. I orchestrate the cross-functional delivery of trust orchestration for AI agent autonomous transactions — coordinating Stripe's most complex program across engineering, compliance, and legal teams. I have competing offers from [Adyen at $335K TC / Block at $322K TC / PayPal at $312K TC]. TPMs who orchestrate agentic commerce program delivery are driving execution of Stripe's most strategic initiative." Accept at $202K+ base and $242K+ RSUs.
