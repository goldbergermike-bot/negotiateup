### DevOps Engineer | Stripe Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Agentic Commerce Suite | $100B+ Valuation | $1T+ Payment Volume | **TRUST ORCHESTRATOR PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $172K–$218K | $158K–$278K | 10–15% | $232K–$325K |
| New York | $172K–$218K | $158K–$278K | 10–15% | $232K–$325K |
| Remote US | $162K–$205K | $148K–$258K | 10–15% | $218K–$305K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe DevOps Engineers own the infrastructure reliability, deployment pipelines, and operational excellence of the payment platform that processes $1 trillion+ annually — ensuring 99.999%+ uptime for financial infrastructure that millions of businesses depend on across 195+ countries. At the IC2-IC3 level, you build CI/CD pipelines, manage cloud infrastructure, automate deployments, and maintain the observability systems that keep Stripe's payment processing running at global scale. With the Agentic Commerce Suite launched at NRF 2026, DevOps Engineers now ensure that autonomous AI agent transaction infrastructure meets the same five-nines reliability standard as human-initiated payments — while scaling to handle exponentially higher transaction volumes from agent-to-agent commerce. Stripe's $100B+ valuation and secondary market RSU liquidity reward infrastructure engineers who keep the financial internet operational. [Source: Stripe DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Agentic Commerce — The Trust Orchestrator Premium**

As a DevOps Engineer during the agentic commerce revolution, you ensure the infrastructure reliability that makes trust orchestration possible — maintaining five-nines uptime for AI agent identity verification, payment authorization, and liability management systems. If the trust infrastructure goes down, autonomous agents cannot transact, and the entire agentic commerce ecosystem halts. Your reliability engineering directly enables the Identity Liability solution. "As a DevOps Engineer ensuring Agentic Commerce infrastructure reliability, I maintain five-nines uptime for the trust orchestration systems that solve Identity Liability — agent identity verification, payment authorization, and liability management. If my infrastructure fails, autonomous commerce stops. I want IC2-IC3 equity reflecting the criticality of agentic commerce reliability."

**Global Levers**

1. **Trust Infrastructure Reliability:** "I maintain five-nines uptime for AI agent identity verification and payment authorization systems. Any infrastructure failure halts all autonomous agent transactions — this criticality makes agentic commerce DevOps a premium role."
2. **$1T+ Uptime Ownership:** "I ensure operational reliability for infrastructure processing over $1 trillion annually. Every minute of downtime costs Stripe millions in lost transactions — my work directly protects Stripe's revenue and reputation at global scale."
3. **Adyen/Block/PayPal DevOps Competition:** "DevOps engineers who can maintain payment infrastructure reliability at trillion-dollar scale are scarce. Adyen, Block, and PayPal are offering $312K+ TC packages to attract infrastructure engineers who ensure five-nines uptime for financial systems."
4. **Agentic Commerce Scale Challenge:** "AI agent-to-agent transactions will generate exponentially higher transaction volumes than human-initiated payments. I'm building the infrastructure to handle this scale increase while maintaining the same reliability standards — a unique DevOps challenge."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $212K base and $268K RSUs over 4 years with 15% performance bonus for this DevOps Engineer role. I ensure five-nines uptime for the trust orchestration infrastructure enabling AI agent autonomous transactions — any downtime halts all agentic commerce. I have competing offers from [Adyen at $312K TC / Block at $298K TC / PayPal at $288K TC]. DevOps engineers who maintain agentic commerce reliability at trillion-dollar scale are critical infrastructure hires." Accept at $188K+ base and $225K+ RSUs.
