**Negotiation DNA**

Stripe Product Designers craft the interfaces and experiences that millions of businesses use to manage their payments — designing the checkout flows, dashboards, and developer tools that process $1 trillion+ annually across 195+ countries. At the D2-D3 level, you own design systems, user research, and interaction patterns for Stripe's payment platform. With the Agentic Commerce Suite launched at NRF 2026, Product Designers now face an unprecedented challenge: designing trust experiences for AI agent-to-agent transactions where traditional human-centered UX paradigms no longer apply. Stripe's $100B+ valuation and secondary market RSU liquidity offer compelling equity packages for designers who can reimagine commerce for the autonomous agent era.

You solve the Identity Liability problem from the design perspective: creating visual systems that communicate agent identity, authorization status, and liability chains to both human operators and AI agents. "As a Product Designer for the Agentic Commerce Suite, I'm designing trust experiences for AI agent autonomous transactions — solving the Identity Liability problem through design. I create the interfaces that make agent identity verification, payment authorization, and liability management transparent and trustworthy. I want D2-D3 equity reflecting the pioneering nature of this design work."
