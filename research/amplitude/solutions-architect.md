**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions architects at Amplitude design analytics implementations for enterprise customers. This goes beyond standard SDK integration — you're designing event taxonomies, defining behavioral tracking strategies, building data governance frameworks, and connecting Amplitude to enterprise data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks). Each enterprise implementation requires understanding the customer's product, their analytics maturity, and their data infrastructure. Your technical design directly determines whether the customer gets value from Amplitude or churns after a frustrating implementation.

Amplitude's enterprise revenue depends on successful implementations. A badly designed event taxonomy means the customer can't answer the questions they need to, which means they stop using Amplitude, which means they churn. Solutions architects who can design robust, forward-looking implementations that grow with the customer's analytics maturity directly protect revenue and enable upsell.

### AI Analytics Implementation Lever

Amplitude's AI features create new implementation considerations: AI models need well-structured event data to generate meaningful insights, and poorly designed event taxonomies can make AI features useless. Solutions architects who understand how AI models consume event data can design implementations that maximize AI feature value — ensuring customers get the full benefit of Amplitude's AI capabilities from day one.

If you have experience designing analytics implementations with AI/ML considerations, you're in a niche that Amplitude increasingly needs as AI features become the product's primary value proposition.

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue Protection:** "I design implementations that determine whether enterprise customers get value from Amplitude. Bad implementations cause churn; great implementations drive retention and upsell."
2. **Event Taxonomy Design:** "I design event taxonomies — the foundation of product analytics. A well-designed taxonomy makes every analytics query possible; a poorly designed one makes the platform useless."
3. **AI-Ready Implementation:** "I design implementations that maximize AI feature value. Understanding how AI models consume event data lets me create taxonomies that unlock Amplitude's full AI capabilities."
4. **Enterprise Technical Credibility:** "During sales, I'm the technical credibility that convinces enterprise prospects to commit. My implementation design directly influences deal closure."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $178K over 4 years with a $18K signing bonus and clarity on variable comp tied to implementation success or deal influence. I directly protect enterprise revenue through implementation quality." Amplitude will counter at $138K-$165K RSUs — accept at $155K+ with the signing bonus.
