### Technical Program Manager | Amplitude Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Based / Public Company | AI-Powered Product Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $158K–$200K | $105K–$182K | 15–20% | $195K–$265K |
| New York | $153K–$195K | $100K–$175K | 15–20% | $190K–$258K |
| London | £92K–£128K | £52K–£92K | 15–20% | £115K–£158K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical program managers at Amplitude coordinate cross-functional initiatives across the product analytics platform: major platform releases (event ingestion upgrades, query engine improvements), enterprise feature rollouts, compliance programs (SOC 2, GDPR, data residency), and the company-wide AI feature deployment. TPMs at Amplitude manage programs that affect every enterprise customer — a botched platform migration or feature rollout can impact analytics reliability for thousands of companies.

Amplitude's 2026 priorities — AI feature deployment, enterprise expansion, and platform performance improvements — all require TPM coordination. The company's mid-size means TPMs work directly with engineering leadership, product, and enterprise customers — there's no bureaucratic layer between you and the decision-makers. This direct access is both a responsibility and an opportunity for impact. [Source: Amplitude Program Management 2025-2026]

### AI Analytics Rollout Lever

Amplitude's AI feature rollout is the company's highest-priority cross-functional program. TPMs coordinating this rollout manage dependencies across ML engineering (model readiness), data engineering (feature pipelines), product (feature definition), design (UX), and enterprise customers (migration and enablement). The AI rollout affects every product surface and every customer — getting the coordination right is essential to Amplitude's competitive strategy.

If you have experience managing platform-wide feature rollouts, especially with AI/ML dependencies, you're exactly the TPM profile Amplitude needs for its most strategic program.

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform-Wide Impact:** "I coordinate programs that affect every enterprise customer. A botched rollout impacts analytics reliability for thousands of companies — my coordination directly protects customer trust."
2. **AI Feature Deployment Coordination:** "I manage Amplitude's AI feature rollout across ML, data, product, design, and customer success. This company-wide AI coordination is the highest-priority TPM work."
3. **Direct Leadership Access:** "At Amplitude's size, I work directly with engineering leadership and enterprise customers. This direct access means my program decisions have immediate impact without bureaucratic delay."
4. **Public Company Accountability:** "At a public company, platform releases affect reported metrics. My program coordination directly impacts the operational metrics that investors track."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $168K over 4 years with a $15K signing bonus. I coordinate Amplitude's most strategic programs — the AI feature rollout and enterprise platform migrations that directly affect reported company metrics." Amplitude will counter at $132K-$158K RSUs — accept at $148K+ with the signing bonus.
