**Negotiation DNA**

Staff engineers at Amplitude set the technical direction for the entire product analytics platform. Given Amplitude's size (mid-cap public company, ~600 employees), staff engineers are among the most influential technologists in the organization. You're not one of hundreds of staff engineers — you're one of a handful who define architecture, drive platform migrations, and shape the AI strategy from a technical perspective. This concentration of influence means your decisions have outsized impact on Amplitude's product trajectory and competitive positioning.

At the staff level, Amplitude competes with Big Tech for talent. The pitch is ownership: at Amplitude, you shape the entire platform; at Google, you'd optimize a subsystem. Negotiate the equity to reflect this ownership premium — your decisions affect every one of Amplitude's enterprise customers. Public company RSUs provide liquidity that private companies can't match, but you should also negotiate for performance-based refreshes that reward the disproportionate impact staff engineers have.

**Level Mapping:** Amplitude SWE (Staff) = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Mixpanel Staff/Principal

### AI Platform Architecture Lever

At the staff level, you're defining Amplitude's AI architecture — the model serving infrastructure, feature computation engine, embedding stores, and inference pipelines that power every AI-driven feature. These architectural decisions determine whether Amplitude can ship AI features faster than Mixpanel and Heap, or whether AI remains a marketing bullet point without technical substance. Getting this architecture right is the difference between Amplitude leading the AI analytics category and trailing it.

Your negotiation should emphasize the strategic leverage of platform architecture. Amplitude's competitors are all investing in AI; the company that builds the best AI infrastructure wins.

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform-Defining Influence:** "I'm one of a handful of staff engineers defining Amplitude's technical direction. My architecture decisions affect every enterprise customer and every product team. This concentrated influence justifies top-of-band equity."
2. **AI Architecture Leadership:** "I'm designing the AI infrastructure that determines whether Amplitude leads or trails in the AI analytics category. Getting this architecture right is the difference between market leadership and irrelevance."
3. **Ownership vs. Big Tech Trade-Off:** "At Google, I'd optimize a subsystem. At Amplitude, I shape the entire platform. The equity should compensate me for the ownership premium I'm accepting by choosing a smaller company."
4. **Performance Refresh Commitment:** "At the staff level, I want a written commitment on performance-based refresh grants. My disproportionate impact should be reflected in annual equity refreshes, not just the initial grant."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $380K over 4 years with a $40K signing bonus. I'm defining Amplitude's AI platform architecture — the technical decisions that determine the company's competitive positioning in the AI analytics category. I also want a committed performance refresh of 25%+ of the annual vest for top performers." Amplitude will counter at $300K-$355K RSUs — accept at $340K+ with the signing bonus and refresh commitment.
