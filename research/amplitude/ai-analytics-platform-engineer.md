**Negotiation DNA**

This is Amplitude's signature role for 2026 — the AI Analytics Platform Engineer. You're building the AI infrastructure that transforms Amplitude from a charting tool into an intelligent product analytics platform. This role combines behavioral ML (predicting user actions across thousands of different products), NLP (powering natural-language analytics queries), real-time inference (delivering AI insights within the interactive analytics experience), and cross-domain generalization (building models that work for e-commerce, SaaS, media, and gaming simultaneously). No other analytics company has invested this deeply in AI-native platform engineering.

Amplitude's competitive survival depends on AI differentiation. Google Analytics 4 is free. Mixpanel and Heap are aggressively pricing. The only sustainable competitive advantage is intelligence — AI features that provide insights no other platform can match. The AI Analytics Platform Engineer is the person who builds that advantage. Every model you deploy, every inference pipeline you optimize, and every AI feature you enable directly determines whether enterprise customers continue paying $100K-$500K+ annually for Amplitude or switch to cheaper alternatives.

**Level Mapping:** Amplitude AI Platform Eng (Senior) = Google L4-L5 ML Platform = Mixpanel Senior ML = Heap AI Lead

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The AI Analytics Platform Engineer builds systems that don't exist at other analytics companies in this form:
- **Cross-Product Behavioral Models:** ML models that identify universal behavioral patterns across thousands of different products — predicting churn, engagement, and conversion using cross-industry training data
- **Natural-Language Analytics Engine:** LLM-powered interface that translates natural-language questions ("Why did sign-ups drop last week?") into multi-step analytical workflows and returns narrative answers
- **Real-Time Insight Inference:** Sub-second AI insight generation within the interactive analytics experience — anomalies, correlations, and recommendations surfaced as users explore their data
- **Automated Analytics Workflows:** AI systems that proactively monitor metrics, detect meaningful changes, and generate reports without human intervention

**Global Levers**

1. **Competitive Survival Platform:** "I'm building the AI platform that determines whether Amplitude justifies paid pricing against free alternatives. Without the AI features I build, Amplitude can't defend its enterprise pricing. My equity should reflect this existential product bet."
2. **No-Equivalent-Role Scarcity:** "This role — AI platform engineering for cross-product behavioral analytics — doesn't exist at other companies. There's no direct comp benchmark for building natural-language analytics, cross-domain behavioral prediction, and real-time AI insights in a single platform."
3. **AI Analytics Premium (15-30%):** "I'm building the intelligence that transforms Amplitude from a charting tool into a strategic analytics platform. This isn't generic ML — it's the AI that justifies Amplitude's entire business model. I want the full 30% premium."
4. **Enterprise Revenue Protection:** "Every AI feature I build directly justifies $100K-$500K+ annual enterprise contracts. My work is the moat that prevents enterprise customers from switching to free alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the AI platform that justifies Amplitude's entire business model. I'd like the RSU grant at $360K over 4 years, with the AI Analytics premium fully applied, plus a $40K signing bonus. I also want a committed annual refresh of 25%+ of the annual vest for top performers, because this role's impact will compound over time." Amplitude will counter at $290K-$340K RSUs — accept at $320K+ with the signing bonus and refresh commitment. This is Amplitude's highest-leverage engineering role.
