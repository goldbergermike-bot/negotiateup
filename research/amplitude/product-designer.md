### Product Designer | Amplitude Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Based / Public Company | AI-Powered Product Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $145K–$182K | $90K–$155K | 10–15% | $170K–$228K |
| New York | $140K–$178K | $85K–$148K | 10–15% | $165K–$220K |
| London | £82K–£112K | £45K–£78K | 10–15% | £98K–£135K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product designers at Amplitude face one of the hardest UX challenges in B2B software: making complex data analysis feel intuitive. Analytics products are inherently complicated — they deal with event schemas, behavioral cohorts, funnel analysis, and statistical concepts that most users find intimidating. Your job is to make this complexity accessible without dumbing it down. This tension — powerful yet approachable — is what separates great analytics design from mediocre analytics design.

Amplitude's design quality directly affects enterprise sales. Product demos are a critical part of the enterprise buying process, and the design's intuitiveness during a demo often determines whether a prospect becomes a customer. Designers who can create experiences that look impressive in a demo while being genuinely useful in daily work are building Amplitude's sales pipeline.

### AI Analytics UX Lever

Designing AI features for analytics is uniquely challenging: users need to trust AI-generated insights enough to make product decisions, but they also need to understand the methodology well enough to validate the insights. Blind trust in AI analytics is dangerous (it leads to bad product decisions), but excessive skepticism makes the AI useless. The designer who finds the right trust calibration for AI analytics will define the standard for the entire category.

If you have experience designing data visualization, AI-powered tools, or analytics interfaces, you're in the exact intersection Amplitude needs. The ability to make AI outputs both trustworthy and actionable in a data context is the rarest skill in B2B design.

**Global Levers**

1. **Complexity-to-Simplicity Translation:** "I make complex data analysis feel intuitive. This tension — powerful yet approachable — is the hardest UX challenge in B2B analytics, and it's my specialty."
2. **AI Trust Calibration:** "I design AI features where users need to trust insights enough to act but understand methodology enough to validate. Finding this AI trust balance defines the analytics category."
3. **Demo-Driven Design Impact:** "Amplitude's design quality directly drives enterprise sales. My work looks impressive in demos while being genuinely useful in daily work — that's the dual standard."
4. **Category Design Authority:** "I understand the analytics design landscape — Amplitude, Mixpanel, Heap, Looker. Every design decision I make strengthens Amplitude's position as the best-designed analytics platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $142K over 4 years with a $15K signing bonus. Amplitude's design quality drives both user retention and enterprise sales — my work is directly revenue-impactful." Amplitude will counter at $112K-$132K RSUs — accept at $125K+ with the signing bonus.
