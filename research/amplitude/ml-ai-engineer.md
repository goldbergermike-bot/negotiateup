### ML/AI Engineer | Amplitude Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Based / Public Company | AI-Powered Product Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $175K–$222K | $150K–$265K | 10–15% | $225K–$310K |
| New York | $170K–$218K | $145K–$255K | 10–15% | $220K–$302K |
| London | £108K–£142K | £75K–£135K | 10–15% | £138K–£195K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI engineers at Amplitude are the company's most strategically important technical hires in 2026. Your models power the AI features that differentiate Amplitude from free alternatives and competitors: predictive cohorts, auto-generated insights, behavioral anomaly detection, natural-language querying, and intelligent alerting. These aren't experimental features — they're the product capabilities that enterprise customers evaluate when choosing analytics platforms. Model quality directly determines product quality, customer satisfaction, and revenue.

Amplitude's ML/AI challenge is uniquely hard: your models must work across thousands of different products with different event schemas, user behaviors, and business contexts. A predictive churn model that works for an e-commerce app must also work for a SaaS product and a media platform. This generalization requirement means you can't fine-tune per customer — you need models that understand universal behavioral patterns. This cross-domain behavioral ML expertise is rare.

### AI Analytics Intelligence Lever

Amplitude's AI analytics platform requires models that operate under product-grade constraints: latency (insights must appear in seconds), accuracy (product teams make decisions based on your insights), explainability (users need to understand why the AI surfaced a particular insight), and generalization (models work across thousands of different products). Building models that satisfy all four constraints is what makes Amplitude's ML challenge unique.

If you have experience with behavioral analytics ML, recommendation systems, or cross-domain model generalization, you're in the top tier of candidates. The combination of behavioral understanding and production ML engineering is rare.

**Global Levers**

1. **Model-as-Product Revenue:** "My models become product features that enterprise customers pay $100K-$500K+ annually for. Model quality directly determines product quality and enterprise revenue."
2. **Cross-Domain Generalization Expertise:** "I build models that work across e-commerce, SaaS, media, and gaming simultaneously. This generalization skill — making models work without per-customer fine-tuning — is exceptionally rare."
3. **AI Strategy Embodiment:** "Amplitude's AI strategy depends on ML engineers. We are the highest-priority hires because AI features are the primary competitive differentiator. My comp should reflect this priority."
4. **Behavioral ML Specialization:** "I combine behavioral science understanding with ML engineering. This interdisciplinary expertise generates more useful product insights than pure engineering approaches."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $248K over 4 years with a $28K signing bonus. My models become the AI features that differentiate Amplitude in the market. Cross-domain behavioral ML is my specialty — and it's the exact capability Amplitude's AI strategy requires." Amplitude will counter at $195K-$235K RSUs — accept at $218K+ with the signing bonus.
