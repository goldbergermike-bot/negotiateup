**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering managers at Amplitude lead teams that build the analytics infrastructure trusted by enterprises for product decisions. The EM role at Amplitude carries both technical and people leadership: you're expected to make architecture decisions, review designs, and drive technical quality alongside managing team performance and development. Amplitude's smaller team size means each EM manages a larger product surface — you're not leading a feature team, you're leading a platform team responsible for core analytics capabilities.

Amplitude's public company dynamics affect EM compensation: RSUs vest quarterly with full liquidity, bonus targets are tied to company performance metrics (ARR growth, net retention), and the overall comp structure is more transparent than at private companies. Use this transparency to your advantage — ask for the comp bands, understand where you fall, and negotiate to the top of the band. [Source: Amplitude Engineering Management, Careers 2025-2026]

### AI Analytics Team Leadership Lever

Amplitude's AI analytics team is the company's highest-priority engineering investment. EMs on this team manage the engineers building the AI features that determine whether Amplitude justifies its paid pricing against free alternatives. You're leading the team that defines Amplitude's competitive positioning — every quarter, your team needs to ship AI features that prove the analytics platform is worth $100K-$500K+ annually to enterprise customers.

If you have experience managing ML/AI teams alongside platform engineering teams, you carry a premium. The ability to balance ML experimentation with production reliability is a specific leadership skill that Amplitude needs.

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Team Leadership:** "I lead a platform team responsible for core analytics capabilities used by every enterprise customer. This is broader ownership than most EM roles at larger companies."
2. **AI Team Management:** "I manage the team building Amplitude's AI competitive differentiation. My leadership directly determines whether Amplitude's AI features meet enterprise standards."
3. **Public Company Transparency:** "I want to see the comp bands and understand where my offer falls. Amplitude's public company structure means this data exists — I expect to negotiate within a transparent framework."
4. **Bonus Structure Clarity:** "I want clarity on the bonus structure — specifically how company performance metrics (ARR growth, NRR) affect the actual payout. Is the 15-20% target realistic or aspirational?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $320K over 4 years with a $30K signing bonus and a guaranteed first-year bonus floor of 15%. I'm leading the AI analytics team — the comp should reflect both the strategic importance and the team management complexity." Amplitude will counter at $260K-$300K RSUs — accept at $280K+ with the signing bonus and bonus guarantee.
