### Software Engineer | Amplitude Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Based / Public Company | AI-Powered Product Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $150K–$185K | $100K–$175K | 10–15% | $180K–$238K |
| New York | $145K–$180K | $95K–$168K | 10–15% | $175K–$230K |
| London | £85K–£115K | £50K–£90K | 10–15% | £105K–£148K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Amplitude (AMPL) is the public product analytics platform competing against Mixpanel, Heap, and increasingly Google Analytics 4 in the product intelligence category. The company's 2026 strategy centers on AI-powered analytics — using AI to surface product insights automatically, predict user behavior, and democratize data analysis beyond data teams. Amplitude's stock has been volatile since IPO, trading between $8-$15 in 2025-2026, which means RSU negotiation requires both grant-size awareness and strike-price/refresh strategy.

Software engineers at Amplitude build the analytics infrastructure that processes billions of user events daily for companies like Walmart, NBC, Burger King, and PayPal. The engineering challenges are real: event ingestion at massive scale, real-time query engines for interactive analytics, and increasingly, ML/AI models that automate insight generation. Amplitude's engineering team is smaller than Big Tech, which means each engineer owns more surface area and has more direct product impact. [Source: Amplitude 2025-2026 10-K, Investor Day]

### AI Analytics Platform Lever

Amplitude's AI analytics features — auto-generated insights, predictive cohorts, natural-language queries, and anomaly detection — are the company's primary differentiation strategy against free alternatives like GA4. Engineers building these AI features are directly creating the product value that justifies Amplitude's paid tier. Every AI feature that saves a product manager time or surfaces an insight they wouldn't have found manually strengthens the case for Amplitude over free tools.

If you have experience with analytics ML, recommendation systems, or data visualization, you're building the exact capabilities Amplitude needs for its AI analytics strategy.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Differentiation Builder:** "Amplitude's AI features are the moat against free alternatives like GA4. I'm building the AI capabilities that justify Amplitude's paid pricing — my work directly drives revenue retention."
2. **Public Company RSU Liquidity:** "Amplitude's RSUs are liquid from day one. I want the grant sized generously because I'm taking on a smaller-company role without the illiquidity discount that private companies offer."
3. **Event-Scale Engineering:** "I process billions of user events daily. The scale and performance requirements of Amplitude's analytics engine exceed what most mid-cap companies offer — my comp should reflect this technical complexity."
4. **Stock Price Opportunity:** "If Amplitude's stock is at a relative low, my RSU grant buys more shares at the current price. I want the dollar value of the grant to be generous because share appreciation amplifies the value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $160K over 4 years with a $15K signing bonus. Amplitude's AI analytics strategy is the company's path to revenue growth, and I'm building the features that drive that growth." Amplitude will counter at $125K-$148K RSUs — accept at $140K+ with the signing bonus.
