**Negotiation DNA**

Data engineers at Amplitude build the pipeline infrastructure that ingests, processes, and serves billions of user events daily. This isn't standard ETL — Amplitude's event processing pipeline must handle massive throughput (millions of events per second), maintain strict ordering guarantees, and deliver sub-second query latency for interactive analytics. The pipeline infrastructure is the product: if events are delayed, duplicated, or lost, customers can't trust their analytics, and Amplitude loses credibility.

Amplitude's data engineering challenges are at the intersection of streaming infrastructure and analytics serving. You're building pipelines that not only store events but also power real-time behavioral queries, feed ML models for AI features, and support historical analysis across months of data. This multi-purpose pipeline architecture — streaming ingestion, real-time serving, batch ML training, and historical querying from a single infrastructure — is among the most complex data engineering challenges in the analytics industry.

### AI Feature Pipeline Lever

Amplitude's AI features depend on data pipelines that transform raw behavioral events into ML-ready features. The data engineering challenge is serving both the real-time analytics product (sub-second query latency) and the AI model training pipeline (batch computation of behavioral features) from the same underlying infrastructure. If you have experience with dual-serving pipeline architectures, you're solving Amplitude's core data engineering challenge.

Every new AI feature requires new feature computations, and pipeline architecture decisions compound: a good architecture accelerates all future AI development, while a poor one becomes a bottleneck.

**Global Levers**

1. **Pipeline-as-Product:** "Amplitude's data pipeline is the product. Pipeline reliability directly determines customer trust and product quality. I'm building the foundation that every feature depends on."
2. **Event-Scale Engineering:** "I process billions of events daily with strict ordering, latency, and accuracy requirements. This event-scale engineering exceeds what most data engineer roles demand."
3. **AI Feature Serving:** "Amplitude's AI features depend on the pipelines I build. Pipeline architecture determines how fast new AI features can ship — I'm the enabler of Amplitude's AI strategy."
4. **Public Company Impact:** "At a public company, my pipeline reliability affects reported customer metrics. Every outage impacts net retention rates — my work directly influences Amplitude's public metrics."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $158K over 4 years with a $15K signing bonus. My pipelines process billions of events daily and power every analytics feature and AI model at Amplitude." Amplitude will counter at $122K-$148K RSUs — accept at $138K+ with the signing bonus.
