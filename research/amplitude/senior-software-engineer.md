### Senior Software Engineer | Amplitude Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Based / Public Company | AI-Powered Product Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K–$228K | $150K–$260K | 10–15% | $228K–$310K |
| New York | $180K–$222K | $145K–$250K | 10–15% | $222K–$302K |
| London | £110K–£145K | £75K–£130K | 10–15% | £138K–£192K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior engineers at Amplitude own critical platform components: the event ingestion pipeline, the real-time query engine, the behavioral analytics computation layer, or the AI-powered insight generation system. Amplitude's smaller engineering team (compared to Big Tech) means senior engineers have broader ownership and more direct influence on the product. Your architecture decisions affect how quickly Amplitude can ship new AI features, how well the platform performs at scale, and whether enterprise customers trust the analytics results.

Amplitude's public company status creates a specific negotiation dynamic: RSUs are liquid (no illiquidity risk), but the stock's volatility means your equity value fluctuates with market sentiment. Negotiate for a larger share count if the stock is depressed, or push for performance-based refresh grants if you believe in the AI analytics thesis. Senior engineers who join during a stock price trough and receive generous grants can see significant appreciation as the AI strategy drives revenue growth.

### AI Analytics Engine Lever

Amplitude's AI analytics engine is the core technical differentiator: auto-generated insights, predictive cohorts, natural-language querying, and anomaly detection all rely on ML models that process billions of events and surface patterns that human analysts would miss. Senior engineers building this engine are creating the product capability that enterprise customers pay $100K-$500K+ annually for.

If you have experience with analytics platforms, query optimization, or ML inference at scale, you're in the highest-demand segment for Amplitude hiring. The combination of distributed systems expertise and ML application skills translates directly to the AI analytics engine.

**Global Levers**

1. **Broad Ownership Premium:** "At Amplitude, I own an entire platform component that directly affects every customer. This ownership breadth exceeds what senior engineers typically have at larger companies."
2. **Stock Timing Strategy:** "If AMPL stock is at a relative low, I want a larger share count. My bet on Amplitude's AI analytics thesis means I want maximum share exposure for when the strategy drives revenue growth."
3. **Enterprise Revenue Impact:** "The AI analytics features I build are what enterprise customers pay $100K-$500K+ annually for. My engineering work directly drives Amplitude's enterprise revenue."
4. **Platform Performance Authority:** "I own the performance characteristics of Amplitude's analytics engine. Query speed and reliability directly determine customer satisfaction and retention — my work is revenue-critical."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $240K over 4 years with a $22K signing bonus. I'm building the AI analytics engine that enterprise customers pay premium pricing for. I also want clarity on the refresh grant philosophy — what do top performers receive annually?" Amplitude will counter at $190K-$225K RSUs — accept at $210K+ with the signing bonus.
