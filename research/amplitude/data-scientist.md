### Data Scientist | Amplitude Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Based / Public Company | AI-Powered Product Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $155K–$195K | $115K–$195K | 10–15% | $195K–$262K |
| New York | $150K–$190K | $110K–$188K | 10–15% | $190K–$255K |
| London | £92K–£125K | £55K–£100K | 10–15% | £115K–£162K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data scientists at Amplitude occupy a uniquely meta position: you're building the analytics models that help other companies' data teams do analytics better. Your work powers Amplitude's AI-driven features — predictive cohorts, auto-generated insights, anomaly detection, and behavioral clustering. The models you build don't just analyze data; they become product features that thousands of companies use to make product decisions. This means your model quality directly determines Amplitude's product quality and enterprise customer satisfaction.

Amplitude's dataset is unique: aggregate behavioral data across thousands of products and billions of user events. This cross-product behavioral dataset enables models that no single company could build on its own — you can identify universal behavioral patterns, benchmark engagement metrics, and predict churn signals using cross-industry data. This unique dataset is your negotiation leverage. [Source: Amplitude Data Science Team 2025-2026]

### AI Analytics Models Lever

Amplitude's AI analytics features — predictive cohorts, auto-insights, anomaly detection — are powered by data science models trained on the company's cross-product behavioral dataset. These models must work across different product types (e-commerce, SaaS, media, gaming), different event schemas, and different scale levels. Building generalizable behavioral models that work well across this diversity is the core data science challenge.

If you have experience with behavioral analytics, recommendation systems, or cross-domain ML, you're building the exact models Amplitude needs. The combination of behavioral science understanding and ML engineering skills is rare.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Product Dataset Access:** "Amplitude's behavioral dataset spans thousands of products and billions of events. The models I build on this unique dataset create capabilities no competitor can replicate."
2. **Model-as-Product Impact:** "My models become product features. Model quality equals product quality — and product quality determines enterprise renewal rates. I'm directly building revenue."
3. **Behavioral Science + ML Dual Expertise:** "I combine behavioral analytics understanding with ML engineering skills. This dual expertise is essential for building models that generate genuinely useful product insights."
4. **Generalizable Model Challenge:** "Building models that work across e-commerce, SaaS, media, and gaming requires domain-agnostic behavioral understanding. This generalization skill is rare and valuable."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $180K over 4 years with a $18K signing bonus. My models become Amplitude's AI product features — the capabilities that enterprise customers evaluate when choosing between Amplitude and competitors." Amplitude will counter at $142K-$168K RSUs — accept at $158K+ with the signing bonus.
