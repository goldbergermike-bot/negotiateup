### Product Manager | Amplitude Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU-Based / Public Company | AI-Powered Product Analytics

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$200K | $120K–$210K | 15–20% | $205K–$278K |
| New York | $155K–$195K | $115K–$200K | 15–20% | $198K–$270K |
| London | £98K–£130K | £60K–£108K | 15–20% | £120K–£170K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product managers at Amplitude define the analytics experience for product teams at some of the world's largest companies. This is a meta-PM role: you're building the tools that other product managers use to make product decisions. Understanding how PMs think, what analytics they need, and where current tools fail is essential context that only PM-experienced candidates can bring. Amplitude PMs who have actually been product analytics users before have a significant advantage.

Amplitude's 2026 product strategy centers on AI-powered analytics: auto-generated insights, predictive segmentation, natural-language querying, and proactive alerting. PMs defining this AI product vision are answering a fundamental question: can AI democratize product analytics beyond data teams? If the answer is yes, Amplitude captures a massive TAM expansion. If no, the product remains a specialized tool for data-savvy teams. The PM who gets this AI vision right defines Amplitude's next chapter. [Source: Amplitude Product Team, Investor Day 2025-2026]

### AI Analytics Product Vision Lever

Amplitude's AI product vision — making product analytics accessible to non-data-specialists through AI — is a category-defining bet. PMs on this initiative are defining how AI transforms the analytics experience: from "build a chart" to "ask a question." This is not incremental feature work; it's a fundamental reimagination of the product category. The PM who defines this vision correctly positions Amplitude for massive TAM expansion.

If you have PM experience with AI products, analytics tools, or developer/PM tooling, you're in the exact intersection Amplitude needs. The ability to translate AI capabilities into intuitive analytics experiences for non-technical users is the rarest PM skill in the category.

**Global Levers**

1. **Meta-PM Expertise:** "I'm building the tools that other PMs use to make product decisions. My understanding of how PMs think, what analytics they need, and where tools fail gives me unique product intuition."
2. **AI Analytics Vision:** "I'm defining how AI transforms product analytics — from 'build a chart' to 'ask a question.' This category-defining vision determines Amplitude's TAM expansion."
3. **Public Company Product Accountability:** "At a public company, my product decisions directly impact reported metrics — ARR, NRR, and enterprise deal sizes. This accountability drives disciplined product thinking."
4. **Category Expertise:** "I understand the product analytics market — Amplitude, Mixpanel, Heap, GA4. This competitive awareness ensures every product decision strengthens Amplitude's positioning."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $195K over 4 years with a $18K signing bonus. I'm defining Amplitude's AI analytics product vision — the strategy that determines whether Amplitude expands its TAM through AI or remains a specialized analytics tool." Amplitude will counter at $155K-$180K RSUs — accept at $172K+ with the signing bonus.
