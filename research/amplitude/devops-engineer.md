**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps engineers at Amplitude maintain the infrastructure for an analytics platform that enterprise customers depend on for real-time product decision-making. Downtime at Amplitude means product teams at Walmart, NBC, PayPal, and thousands of other companies lose visibility into user behavior — which means product launches get delayed, A/B tests produce invalid results, and executives lose trust in the analytics platform. Amplitude's SLA commitments (99.9%+ uptime, sub-second query latency) are critical to enterprise customer retention.

Amplitude's infrastructure must handle extreme read-write asymmetry: billions of events are written per day, but read patterns are unpredictable (a PM running a complex funnel query can temporarily spike compute by 100x). Building infrastructure that handles this asymmetry efficiently — high-throughput writes, burst-capable reads, and cost-effective storage — is the core DevOps challenge at Amplitude.

### AI Infrastructure Lever

Amplitude's AI features require additional infrastructure: model training pipelines, GPU compute for embedding generation, real-time inference serving for auto-insights, and feature stores for behavioral ML. DevOps engineers who can manage both the analytics infrastructure (high-throughput event processing) and the AI infrastructure (model training and serving) are exactly the profile Amplitude needs.

If you have experience with ML infrastructure alongside traditional cloud ops, frame this dual expertise as a premium — Amplitude needs both and they're rarely found in one person.

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise SLA Reliability:** "I maintain infrastructure that enterprise customers depend on for real-time product decisions. My uptime directly determines customer retention and net revenue retention."
2. **Read-Write Asymmetry Expertise:** "Amplitude's infrastructure handles extreme read-write asymmetry — billions of writes with unpredictable read bursts. Optimizing for this pattern requires specialized expertise."
3. **AI Infrastructure Capability:** "I manage both analytics infrastructure and AI/ML infrastructure. This dual capability — event processing plus model serving — is exactly what Amplitude needs for its AI strategy."
4. **Cost Optimization Impact:** "At a public company, infrastructure costs directly impact margins. My cost optimization work improves Amplitude's profitability — a metric investors track quarterly."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like the RSU grant at $165K over 4 years with a $15K signing bonus. I maintain the infrastructure that enterprise customers depend on for product decisions — and I'm adding the AI infrastructure capabilities for Amplitude's competitive differentiation." Amplitude will counter at $128K-$155K RSUs — accept at $145K+ with the signing bonus.
