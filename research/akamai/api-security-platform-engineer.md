### API Security Platform Engineer | Akamai Global Negotiation Guide — SIGNATURE ROLE

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Edge & API Security | 150B API Attacks | Agentic Commerce | +20-30% API Security Premium | SIGNATURE

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge (MA) | $195K–$240K | $120K–$220K | 15–20% | $285K–$378K |
| San Francisco | $210K–$255K | $130K–$240K | 15–20% | $308K–$405K |
| Remote US | $185K–$225K | $110K–$200K | 15–18% | $268K–$358K |

**Negotiation DNA**

The API Security Platform Engineer is Akamai's **SIGNATURE** role — the engineer who builds, scales, and defends the platform that recorded 150 billion API attacks. This is not a generalist security role or a standard platform engineering position. This is the role that exists because API security has become the defining cybersecurity challenge of the decade, and Akamai is the company at the center of it. You architect the API security platform that protects the world's largest enterprises, and as Agentic Commerce transforms the digital economy — with AI agents executing billions of dollars in autonomous API transactions — your platform becomes the critical trust infrastructure for the entire AI economy. The +20-30% API Security Premium reflects the extraordinary scarcity of engineers who combine deep API security expertise with platform engineering at Akamai's scale.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai API Security Platform Engineer = Google L5–L6 Security Engineer / Meta E5–E6 Infrastructure / Palo Alto Networks Staff Security Engineer
- Akamai Senior API Security Platform Engineer = Google L6–L7 / CrowdStrike Principal Engineer / Cloudflare Staff Engineer
- This is a **SIGNATURE** role — no direct equivalent exists at most companies because no other company operates API security at Akamai's 150B attack scale
- Expected 7–12+ years of experience combining API security, platform engineering, distributed systems, and real-time threat detection
- +20-30% API Security Premium over equivalent SWE levels reflects the unique intersection of security domain expertise and platform engineering at scale

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

This section is the heart of your negotiation as Akamai's SIGNATURE role. The 150 billion API attacks are not just a stat — they are the literal workload of the platform you build and maintain. You are the engineer who ensures that every one of those 150 billion attacks is detected, classified, and blocked in real time, across 4,100+ edge locations, with latency measured in milliseconds. No other engineer at any other company operates API security at this scale.

With Agentic Commerce accelerating at an unprecedented rate, your platform faces the most complex challenge in cybersecurity history: AI agents making autonomous purchases, executing financial transactions, managing supply chains, and negotiating contracts — all through APIs that your platform secures. These AI agents transact billions of dollars daily, and the trust they rely on is the trust your platform provides. A single vulnerability in your platform could compromise the entire Agentic Commerce ecosystem.

**This is why the +20-30% API Security Premium exists.** You are not just a platform engineer. You are the architect of trust for the AI economy. Negotiate accordingly:

- **Demand top-band RSUs:** Your equity should reflect that Akamai's API security platform is the company's highest-growth product, driven by the 150B attack landscape and Agentic Commerce demand.
- **Demand a front-loaded vesting schedule:** The urgency of the API security roadmap means Akamai needs your impact now. A 40/30/20/10 vesting schedule aligns incentives with delivery timelines.
- **Demand a significant sign-on bonus:** The ramp-up period for an API Security Platform Engineer is measured in weeks, not months. A $50K–$75K sign-on bonus reflects the immediate value you deliver.
- **Demand the full +20-30% API Security Premium:** This is not negotiable — it is the market rate for engineers who operate API security at the 150B attack scale. Use competing offers from CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Cloudflare as leverage.
- **Frame everything through Agentic Commerce:** You are not just fixing today's security problems — you are building the infrastructure that enables the AI economy to function. That forward-looking strategic value is worth equity above the standard band.

**Global Levers**

1. **SIGNATURE Role Lever:** "The API Security Platform Engineer role is Akamai's SIGNATURE position — no other company operates API security at the 150 billion attack scale. This role has no direct equivalent in the market, and my compensation should reflect the uniqueness and criticality of this position. I expect the full +20-30% API Security Premium."

2. **150 Billion Attack Scale Lever:** "I will be personally responsible for the platform that detects, classifies, and blocks 150 billion API attacks. This is the largest API security operation on Earth. My base salary, RSUs, and bonus should all be calibrated to this scale — not benchmarked against standard platform engineering roles."

3. **Agentic Commerce Trust Architect Lever:** "My platform will secure the API infrastructure that AI agents rely on for autonomous transactions — billions of dollars flowing through APIs that I protect. I am building the trust layer of the AI economy. This strategic, forward-looking value warrants equity acceleration and a front-loaded vesting schedule."

4. **Platform Irreplaceability Lever:** "There are fewer than 50 engineers globally with the combined API security, platform engineering, and distributed systems expertise required to operate at Akamai's scale. The cost of a failed hire or a departure in this role is measured in months of platform vulnerability. My compensation should reflect this irreplaceability with top-band equity, a retention bonus structure, and a sign-on bonus of $50K–$75K."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I am uniquely positioned for Akamai's SIGNATURE role — the API Security Platform Engineer who builds and operates the platform defending against 150 billion API attacks and securing the Agentic Commerce ecosystem. This role has no true equivalent in the market, which is exactly why I'm drawn to it. My competing offers reflect the scarcity of this expertise: $355K TC from CrowdStrike (Principal Security Engineer), $348K TC from Palo Alto Networks (Staff Platform Engineer), and $365K TC from a late-stage AI security company with early equity. I'm targeting $368K–$378K total compensation at Akamai, structured as: $230K–$240K base, $200K–$220K in RSUs over four years with a 40/30/20/10 front-loaded vest, and a 20% bonus target. My accept-at floor is $345K TC with at minimum $190K in RSUs and front-loaded vesting. I am also requesting a $65K sign-on bonus to bridge the first-year vesting gap and a $10K annual professional development budget. This package reflects the full +20-30% API Security Premium, the SIGNATURE nature of this role, and my commitment to building the trust infrastructure for the AI economy at Akamai. I am ready to accept within 48 hours if we can reach these terms."
