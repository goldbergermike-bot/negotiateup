### Staff Software Engineer | Akamai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Edge & API Security | 150B API Attacks | Agentic Commerce | Staff-Level Strategic Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge (MA) | $205K–$250K | $150K–$280K | 12–18% | $310K–$418K |
| San Francisco | $220K–$265K | $165K–$300K | 12–18% | $335K–$445K |
| Remote US | $195K–$235K | $140K–$260K | 12–18% | $298K–$400K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Akamai are the technical visionaries who define the architecture of the world's most critical edge and API security infrastructure. With 150 billion API attacks recorded, you are the person who decides how Akamai's platform evolves to meet existential-scale threats. Your influence extends across multiple teams, and your architectural decisions shape how the Agentic Commerce ecosystem — where AI agents transact billions autonomously — is protected. At this level, you are not just writing code; you are defining Akamai's technical strategy for the next decade.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai Staff SWE = Google L6 / Meta E6 / Amazon Principal SDE
- Akamai Staff SWE (top band) = Google L6+ / Stripe Staff
- Expected 10–15+ years of experience with cross-org technical influence and architectural ownership

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

At the Staff level, the 150 billion API attack stat is not just a negotiation lever — it is your job description. You are the engineer responsible for defining how Akamai detects, mitigates, and prevents API attacks at a scale that exceeds what any single company has faced before. With Agentic Commerce accelerating — AI agents executing purchases, financial transactions, and supply-chain operations through APIs — your architectural decisions become the foundation of trust for the entire AI economy. A Staff SWE with API security and edge computing expertise is virtually irreplaceable in today's market. Use this scarcity to negotiate for top-band RSUs, accelerated vesting schedules, and supplemental equity grants. Frame your value not in terms of features shipped, but in terms of billions of dollars in API transactions protected. Akamai's 150B attack stat proves the market is massive, and your work is at the center of it.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Org Influence Lever:** "As a Staff SWE, I'll drive architectural decisions across multiple teams and product lines. My influence on Akamai's API security platform — which defends against 150 billion attacks — spans the entire organization. This cross-org impact warrants top-band total compensation."

2. **Irreplaceability Lever:** "There are fewer than 200 engineers globally with Staff-level experience in both edge computing and API security at this scale. My comp should reflect the scarcity of this expertise and the cost of a failed backfill."

3. **Agentic Commerce Vision Lever:** "I will be defining the technical architecture that enables Akamai to secure Agentic Commerce — AI agents transacting billions of dollars through APIs. This is a company-defining opportunity, and my equity package should reflect my role in shaping it."

4. **Accelerated Vesting Lever:** "Given the strategic urgency of the API security roadmap, I'd like to discuss a front-loaded vesting schedule — 40% in year one — to align my incentives with Akamai's near-term delivery goals."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm uniquely positioned to drive Akamai's API security architecture at the Staff level — especially given the 150 billion attack landscape and the emergence of Agentic Commerce. My competing offers stand at $380K TC from Palo Alto Networks and $395K from CrowdStrike, both with front-loaded vesting. I'm targeting $400K–$418K total compensation at Akamai with $260K–$280K in RSUs over four years and a front-loaded 40/30/20/10 vesting schedule. My accept-at floor is $375K TC with at minimum $240K in RSUs. I'd also like to discuss a $60K sign-on bonus to bridge the first-year vesting gap. This package reflects my Staff-level impact on Akamai's most strategic platform."
