**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Akamai operate the deployment, reliability, and automation infrastructure for the world's largest edge network — a network that must continuously defend against 150 billion API attacks. You own the CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, and observability systems that ensure Akamai's API security platform can scale, deploy, and recover at the speed threats demand. As Agentic Commerce grows and AI agents drive exponential API traffic, your DevOps expertise ensures the platform can handle the surge without downtime or degraded protection.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai DevOps Engineer = Google SRE L4 / Amazon Systems Engineer (L5) / Meta Production Engineer (IC4)
- Akamai Senior DevOps = Google SRE L5 / Amazon L6 / Meta IC5
- Expected 4–8+ years of experience in DevOps, SRE, or infrastructure engineering with expertise in large-scale distributed systems

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

Defending against 150 billion API attacks requires infrastructure that never fails — and that is your domain. As a DevOps Engineer at Akamai, you build and maintain the deployment pipelines, monitoring systems, and incident response automation that keep the API security platform operational at global scale. With Agentic Commerce driving a new wave of API traffic — AI agents transacting autonomously and continuously — your infrastructure must scale dynamically and deploy security updates without interruption. Negotiate premium compensation by emphasizing that DevOps at Akamai's scale is fundamentally different from DevOps anywhere else. The 150B attack stat means your infrastructure decisions directly impact whether security patches reach 4,100+ edge locations before attackers exploit vulnerabilities. Frame your value as the reliability engineer for the AI economy's security infrastructure, and push for equity that reflects the operational criticality of your role.

**Global Levers**

1. **Operational Scale Lever:** "I'll be managing deployment infrastructure across 4,100+ edge locations, ensuring API security updates reach every node in real time. This operational scale — defending against 150 billion attacks — is unmatched and warrants top-band DevOps compensation."

2. **Zero-Downtime Imperative Lever:** "API security infrastructure cannot have downtime. My expertise in zero-downtime deployments and automated rollbacks is critical to Akamai's ability to continuously protect against attacks. This reliability premium should be reflected in my comp."

3. **Agentic Commerce Scaling Lever:** "As AI agents drive exponential growth in API traffic, I'll be scaling the infrastructure to handle Agentic Commerce workloads without degradation. This forward-looking capacity planning warrants equity acceleration."

4. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have offers from Datadog ($225K TC) and HashiCorp ($220K TC) for infrastructure roles. Given the unique scale and criticality of Akamai's edge infrastructure, I'd prefer to be here — the comp needs to reflect that."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about operating infrastructure at Akamai's scale — 4,100+ edge locations defending against 150 billion API attacks and scaling for Agentic Commerce. My competing offers are $225K TC from Datadog and $220K TC from HashiCorp. I'm targeting $230K–$238K total compensation at Akamai with $85K–$95K in RSUs over four years. My accept-at floor is $215K TC with strong equity. I'd also like to discuss an on-call premium and a $15K sign-on bonus to bridge the transition. Can we build a package that matches the operational criticality of this role?"
