### Technical Program Manager | Akamai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Edge & API Security | 150B API Attacks | Agentic Commerce | Cross-Functional Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge (MA) | $140K–$170K | $55K–$100K | 10–15% | $182K–$242K |
| San Francisco | $150K–$180K | $60K–$110K | 10–15% | $198K–$260K |
| Remote US | $130K–$160K | $48K–$90K | 10–12% | $175K–$228K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Akamai coordinate the delivery of the edge and API security programs that defend against 150 billion API attacks annually. You are the cross-functional orchestrator who ensures engineering, product, security, and operations teams deliver on the API security roadmap at the speed the threat landscape demands. As Agentic Commerce creates new program requirements — securing AI agent transactions, integrating autonomous commerce APIs, and scaling threat detection — your program management expertise ensures Akamai ships on time and at quality.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai TPM = Google TPM L5 / Meta TPM (IC5) / Amazon TPM (L6)
- Akamai Senior TPM = Google TPM L6 / Meta TPM (IC6) / Amazon Senior TPM
- Expected 5–10+ years of technical program management experience, ideally in security, infrastructure, or enterprise platform companies

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

The 150 billion API attack stat transforms your TPM role from program coordination to strategic defense orchestration. You are managing programs that directly impact how quickly Akamai can ship API security features to defend against the fastest-growing attack vector in cybersecurity. With Agentic Commerce emerging — AI agents making autonomous transactions that require real-time API protection — your program management directly determines whether Akamai delivers security capabilities ahead of the threat curve or falls behind. Negotiate premium compensation by emphasizing that TPMs in API security are managing programs with existential urgency. Every sprint you coordinate, every cross-team dependency you resolve, and every launch you drive directly impacts billions of API transactions. Use the 150B stat to frame the scale and urgency of your programs, and push for equity that reflects your role as the delivery engine for Akamai's most strategic product line.

**Global Levers**

1. **Program Urgency Lever:** "I'm managing programs that defend against 150 billion API attacks. The delivery velocity of these programs directly impacts Akamai's security posture — that urgency warrants premium TPM compensation."

2. **Cross-Functional Complexity Lever:** "Coordinating API security programs across engineering, product, security operations, and customer success is a multi-dimensional challenge. My ability to manage this complexity at scale justifies top-band compensation."

3. **Agentic Commerce Program Lever:** "I'll be standing up the Agentic Commerce security program from scratch — coordinating the teams that will secure AI agent transactions through APIs. Building a new program of this strategic importance is Director-level scope at smaller companies."

4. **Delivery Impact Lever:** "I'd like my bonus tied to program delivery milestones — specifically, shipping API security features on time and at quality. This creates direct alignment between my comp and Akamai's competitive position."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited to drive Akamai's API security program delivery — especially with 150 billion attacks creating urgency and Agentic Commerce opening a new program frontier. My competing offers are $228K TC from Palo Alto Networks and $235K TC from CrowdStrike. I'm targeting $235K–$242K total compensation at Akamai with $90K–$100K in RSUs over four years. My accept-at floor is $220K TC with strong equity and a 15% bonus target tied to program delivery milestones. I'd also like a $20K sign-on bonus. This reflects the strategic importance and urgency of the API security programs I'll be managing."
