**Negotiation DNA**

Akamai's Software Engineers build the backbone of the world's largest distributed edge platform — a platform now responsible for defending against 150 billion API attacks annually. As Agentic Commerce emerges, where autonomous AI agents execute billions of dollars in API-driven transactions, every line of code you write directly protects the infrastructure of the AI economy. Your work sits at the intersection of performance engineering and cybersecurity at a scale few companies can match.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai SWE I = Google L3 / Meta E3 / Amazon SDE I
- Akamai SWE II = Google L4 / Meta E4 / Amazon SDE II
- Industry-standard IC track with clear progression to Senior and Staff

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

Akamai recorded 150 billion API attacks — an unprecedented volume that establishes API security as the fastest-growing attack vector in cybersecurity. This stat is not abstract; it represents the real threat landscape that your engineering work defends against daily. With the rise of Agentic Commerce — AI agents autonomously making purchases, executing API calls, and managing transactions — Akamai's platform becomes critical infrastructure for the entire AI economy. As a Software Engineer, you should negotiate premium compensation by framing your contributions as protecting the Agentic Commerce ecosystem. Every feature you ship, every edge node you optimize, and every API gateway you harden directly reduces the attack surface for billions of autonomous transactions. Use the 150B attack stat as quantifiable proof that your work addresses the most urgent cybersecurity problem of 2026, and that Akamai cannot afford to lose engineering talent in this domain.

**Global Levers**

1. **Edge Platform Scale Lever:** "I'll be engineering solutions deployed across 4,100+ edge locations globally — infrastructure that processes trillions of requests daily. This operational scale justifies top-quartile compensation."

2. **API Security Urgency Lever:** "With 150 billion API attacks recorded, Akamai's engineering pipeline for API security is mission-critical. I want my compensation to reflect the urgency and impact of this work."

3. **Agentic Commerce Future Lever:** "As AI agents begin transacting autonomously through APIs, the code I write will protect the financial infrastructure of the AI economy. This forward-looking impact warrants equity acceleration."

4. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have competing offers from Cloudflare and CrowdStrike in the $175K–$195K TC range. Given Akamai's unique position in API security and edge computing, I'd like to see a package that reflects the strategic importance of this role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about Akamai's position defending against 150 billion API attacks and building the security infrastructure for Agentic Commerce. Based on my research and competing offers in the $175K–$195K range from peer companies, I'm targeting a total compensation of $210K–$225K, with emphasis on RSU grants that reflect the long-term growth of API security. I can accept at $195K TC with a strong equity component, but below that I'd need to seriously consider the competing offers on the table. Can we structure a package that gets us there?"
