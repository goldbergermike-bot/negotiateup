### Product Designer | Akamai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Edge & API Security | 150B API Attacks | Agentic Commerce | Design Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge (MA) | $120K–$148K | $45K–$85K | 8–12% | $158K–$212K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Akamai shape the user experience for the world's most critical cybersecurity and edge computing platform. With 150 billion API attacks driving unprecedented demand for security dashboards, threat visualization, and real-time alerting interfaces, your design work directly impacts how security teams detect and respond to threats. As Agentic Commerce introduces AI agents as a new user persona, your design decisions define how humans and machines interact with Akamai's API security platform.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai Product Designer = Google UX Designer L4–L5 / Meta Product Designer (IC4–IC5) / Amazon UX Designer (L5–L6)
- Akamai Senior Product Designer = Google L5–L6 / Meta IC5–IC6
- Expected 4–8+ years of product design experience, ideally in security, enterprise SaaS, or data-heavy platforms

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

Akamai's 150 billion API attacks create a unique design challenge — and a unique negotiation opportunity. Presenting 150 billion data points in a way that enables security teams to act decisively is one of the hardest UX problems in enterprise software. As a Product Designer, you are the person who transforms overwhelming threat data into actionable interfaces. With Agentic Commerce emerging — AI agents making autonomous transactions through APIs — you will also be designing interfaces that serve both human operators and AI agents, a design paradigm that barely exists today. Use this to negotiate premium compensation: emphasize that security UX design at Akamai's scale requires rare expertise in data visualization, real-time systems, and now AI-agent interaction patterns. The 150B attack stat proves the complexity of the design problem, and your ability to solve it is worth a premium.

**Global Levers**

1. **Complexity Premium Lever:** "Designing interfaces that present 150 billion API attack data points in actionable formats is among the hardest UX challenges in enterprise software. My design expertise in data-dense security interfaces warrants top-band compensation."

2. **Agentic Commerce UX Lever:** "I'll be designing interfaces for both human operators and AI agents — a brand-new interaction paradigm in Agentic Commerce. This pioneering design work should be reflected in my equity grant."

3. **Security Design Scarcity Lever:** "Enterprise security UX designers with experience in threat visualization and real-time systems are exceptionally rare. Competing offers reflect this scarcity."

4. **Platform Impact Lever:** "My design decisions affect how thousands of enterprise security teams interact with Akamai's platform daily. Good design directly reduces mean time to detection and response — that's measurable business impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the design challenges at Akamai — transforming 150 billion API attack data points into actionable security interfaces and pioneering UX for Agentic Commerce. I have competing offers from Cloudflare ($195K TC) and Datadog ($200K TC) for security UX roles. I'm targeting $205K–$212K total compensation at Akamai with $80K–$85K in RSUs over four years. My accept-at floor is $190K TC with strong equity. I'd also like to discuss a $15K sign-on bonus. The design problems at Akamai are uniquely compelling — I just need the package to be competitive."
