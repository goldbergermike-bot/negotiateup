**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Akamai define the roadmap for the world's most critical edge and API security platform — one that defends against 150 billion API attacks annually. You translate the 150B attack landscape into product strategy, prioritize features that protect the Agentic Commerce ecosystem, and drive go-to-market for security products used by the largest enterprises on Earth. Your product decisions directly shape how Akamai captures market share in the fastest-growing segment of cybersecurity.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai PM = Google L5 PM / Meta PM (IC5) / Amazon PM (L6)
- Akamai Senior PM = Google L6 PM / Meta Senior PM / Amazon Senior PM
- Expected 5–10+ years of product management experience, ideally in security, infrastructure, or enterprise SaaS

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

Akamai's 150 billion API attacks stat is the ultimate market-sizing argument for your product roadmap — and for your compensation. As a Product Manager, you own the prioritization and positioning of the API security product line that addresses this massive threat landscape. With Agentic Commerce emerging as the next frontier — AI agents autonomously executing transactions through APIs — your product decisions determine whether Akamai captures the dominant share of this new market. Negotiate based on the fact that the PM who defines the API security product strategy for Agentic Commerce is shaping a multi-billion-dollar revenue opportunity. Push for top-band equity by framing your role as the strategic connector between the 150B attack reality and Akamai's revenue growth. Emphasize that product leadership in API security is rare, and your ability to bridge technical depth with market strategy makes you exceptionally valuable.

**Global Levers**

1. **Market-Sizing Lever:** "The 150 billion API attack stat sizes the addressable market for Akamai's API security products. As the PM driving this roadmap, my product decisions directly impact revenue capture in a market growing 40%+ annually. My comp should reflect this revenue influence."

2. **Agentic Commerce GTM Lever:** "I'll be defining the go-to-market strategy for API security products targeting Agentic Commerce — AI agents transacting through APIs. This is a greenfield product opportunity, and the PM who leads it shapes Akamai's position in the AI economy."

3. **Competitive Scarcity Lever:** "PMs with deep API security domain expertise and enterprise go-to-market experience are extremely scarce. Competing offers from Cloudflare and Palo Alto Networks reflect this scarcity — my comp should match."

4. **Revenue Attribution Lever:** "I'd like to tie a portion of my bonus to API security product revenue milestones, creating direct alignment between my compensation and the business outcomes I drive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited to lead Akamai's API security product strategy in the context of 150 billion attacks and the rise of Agentic Commerce. I have competing offers from Cloudflare ($260K TC) and Palo Alto Networks ($270K TC), both for API security PM roles. I'm targeting $275K–$285K total compensation at Akamai with $130K–$140K in RSUs over four years. My accept-at floor is $255K TC with strong equity. I'd also like to discuss a 15% bonus target tied to API security product revenue milestones and a $25K sign-on bonus. Akamai's unique position in this market makes it my top choice — I just need the comp to match the strategic importance of this role."
