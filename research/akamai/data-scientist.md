**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Akamai analyze the world's largest dataset of web traffic, edge computing telemetry, and cybersecurity threat intelligence. With 150 billion API attacks recorded, you work with attack data at a scale that dwarfs what any academic institution or most competitors can offer. Your models and analyses directly inform how Akamai's API security platform detects emerging threats, and as Agentic Commerce grows, your insights will shape how AI agent transactions are monitored and protected at scale.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai Data Scientist = Google L4–L5 DS / Meta Data Scientist (IC4–IC5) / Amazon Applied Scientist (L5–L6)
- Akamai Senior Data Scientist = Google L5–L6 / Meta IC5–IC6
- Expected 4–8+ years of experience in data science, with strong skills in statistical modeling, ML, and large-scale data analysis

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

The 150 billion API attacks recorded by Akamai represent the richest cybersecurity dataset on the planet — and as a Data Scientist, you are the one who extracts actionable intelligence from it. This is not routine analytics; it is threat intelligence at a scale that defines industry benchmarks. With Agentic Commerce emerging — AI agents making autonomous purchases and transactions through APIs — your models will detect anomalous agent behavior, identify compromised AI transactions, and establish baseline patterns for legitimate autonomous commerce. Negotiate premium compensation by emphasizing the uniqueness of this dataset and the direct impact your work has on Akamai's API security product effectiveness. The 150B stat proves the data volume, and your ability to derive signal from that noise is a rare and high-value skill. Push for RSUs that reflect your contribution to Akamai's threat intelligence competitive advantage.

**Global Levers**

1. **Dataset Uniqueness Lever:** "Akamai's dataset of 150 billion API attacks is unmatched in the cybersecurity industry. My ability to extract actionable threat intelligence from this data is a core competitive advantage — my comp should reflect access to and expertise with this unique asset."

2. **Agentic Commerce Analytics Lever:** "As AI agents begin transacting autonomously, I'll be building the anomaly detection models that identify compromised agent transactions. This is pioneering work in Agentic Commerce security analytics."

3. **Threat Intelligence Impact Lever:** "My models directly improve the detection rate and reduce false positives for Akamai's API security platform — measurable improvements that translate to customer retention and revenue. I'd like my bonus tied to model performance metrics."

4. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have offers from Splunk ($240K TC) and CrowdStrike ($245K TC) for threat intelligence DS roles. Given the unmatched scale of Akamai's dataset, I'd prefer to be here — but the comp needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm drawn to Akamai because of the 150 billion API attack dataset — it's the richest threat intelligence data in the industry, and the Agentic Commerce analytics opportunity is genuinely unique. My competing offers are $240K TC from Splunk and $245K TC from CrowdStrike. I'm targeting $250K–$258K total compensation at Akamai with $110K–$120K in RSUs over four years. My accept-at floor is $235K TC with strong equity. I'd also like a 15% bonus target tied to model performance and threat detection improvements. Can we structure a package that reflects the strategic value of this dataset and my ability to unlock it?"
