### Solutions Architect | Akamai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Edge & API Security | 150B API Attacks | Agentic Commerce | Client-Facing Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge (MA) | $148K–$178K | $60K–$110K | 10–15% | $195K–$258K |
| San Francisco | $155K–$188K | $65K–$120K | 10–15% | $210K–$275K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Akamai are the strategic technical advisors who design and deploy edge and API security solutions for the world's largest enterprises. With 150 billion API attacks driving urgent demand for API security, you are the trusted advisor who translates Akamai's capabilities into customer-specific architectures that protect billions of dollars in digital transactions. As Agentic Commerce emerges, you will design solutions that secure AI agent transactions for enterprise customers — a brand-new solution category that demands both deep technical expertise and consultative selling skills.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai Solutions Architect = AWS SA (L6) / Google Cloud Customer Engineer (L5) / Azure Solutions Architect
- Akamai Senior SA = AWS Senior SA (L7) / Google Cloud L6
- Expected 6–10+ years of experience bridging technical architecture and client-facing consulting, ideally in security or cloud infrastructure

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

As a Solutions Architect, the 150 billion API attack stat is your most powerful sales and design tool — and your strongest negotiation lever. You are the person who walks into enterprise customer meetings and uses this stat to design API security architectures that protect their most critical assets. With Agentic Commerce growing — enterprises deploying AI agents that transact autonomously through APIs — your ability to architect solutions for this new paradigm creates direct revenue impact. Negotiate premium compensation by emphasizing that your role sits at the intersection of technical depth and revenue generation. Every architecture you design translates into Akamai platform consumption, customer retention, and upsell opportunities. The 150B attack stat proves the urgency, and your solution designs convert that urgency into revenue. Push for a bonus structure tied to customer deployment success and an equity package that reflects your revenue influence.

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue Influence Lever:** "My solution architectures directly drive platform adoption and consumption revenue. Each enterprise API security deployment I design translates to measurable ARR — my comp should include a bonus tied to deployment success and revenue influence."

2. **Agentic Commerce Advisory Lever:** "I'll be the first SA advising enterprise customers on securing Agentic Commerce — AI agent transactions through APIs. This pioneering advisory role opens a new revenue stream for Akamai."

3. **Customer Retention Lever:** "When I design the right API security architecture for an enterprise customer, they stay with Akamai. My solution designs directly impact net revenue retention — that's strategic value beyond a standard SA role."

4. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have SA offers from AWS ($250K TC) and Cloudflare ($240K TC). Given Akamai's unique position in API security and the opportunity to design Agentic Commerce solutions, I'd prefer Akamai — but the package needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm drawn to Akamai's unique position — helping enterprises architect defenses against 150 billion API attacks and designing solutions for Agentic Commerce. My competing offers are $250K TC from AWS and $240K TC from Cloudflare. I'm targeting $248K–$258K total compensation at Akamai with $100K–$110K in RSUs over four years. My accept-at floor is $235K TC with strong equity and a 15% bonus target. I'd also like to discuss tying a portion of my bonus to customer deployment success metrics and a $20K sign-on bonus. This reflects the revenue impact of a strong SA in the API security space."
