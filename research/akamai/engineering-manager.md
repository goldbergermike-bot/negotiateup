**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Akamai lead the teams building the edge and API security infrastructure that defends against 150 billion API attacks annually. You are responsible for hiring, retaining, and directing the engineers whose code protects the emerging Agentic Commerce ecosystem. Your leadership decisions — team composition, technical strategy, delivery velocity — directly determine whether Akamai can scale its API security platform fast enough to meet the explosive growth in AI-driven API traffic. This dual technical-and-people leadership warrants premium compensation.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai EM = Google L6 Manager / Meta M1 / Amazon SDM
- Akamai Senior EM = Google L7 Manager / Meta M2 / Amazon Senior SDM
- Expected 8–12+ years of experience with 3+ years managing engineering teams of 6–15+ engineers

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

The 150 billion API attack stat redefines the urgency of your role as an Engineering Manager. You are not managing a team that builds incremental features — you are leading engineers who defend the global API economy against the fastest-growing attack vector in cybersecurity. With Agentic Commerce on the rise — AI agents autonomously executing purchases, supply-chain transactions, and financial operations through APIs — your team's output becomes the trust infrastructure of the AI economy. Use this framing to negotiate for top-band management compensation. Emphasize that retaining API security engineering talent is one of the hardest challenges in the industry, and that your ability to build and keep high-performing teams in this space is worth a significant premium. The 150B attack stat proves the scale of the problem, and your leadership is the force multiplier that determines whether Akamai can solve it.

**Global Levers**

1. **Team Retention Lever:** "API security engineers are among the most sought-after talent in cybersecurity. My ability to recruit and retain a team defending against 150 billion attacks is a direct competitive advantage — my comp should reflect this leadership premium."

2. **Delivery Velocity Lever:** "My team's delivery velocity directly impacts Akamai's ability to ship API security features ahead of the threat curve. I'd like my bonus structure tied to roadmap delivery milestones to align incentives."

3. **Agentic Commerce Team Strategy Lever:** "I'll be building and leading the team that secures Agentic Commerce — AI agents transacting through Akamai-protected APIs. This is a new market, and the team I build will define Akamai's competitive position. My equity should reflect this strategic ownership."

4. **Span of Control Lever:** "Managing a team of 10–15 engineers working on mission-critical API security infrastructure at this scale is comparable to Director-level scope at smaller companies. My compensation should reflect this span of control."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm ready to lead the engineering team defending against 150 billion API attacks and building the security foundation for Agentic Commerce. Given my track record of scaling security engineering teams and competing offers — $330K TC from CrowdStrike and $345K from Palo Alto Networks — I'm targeting $350K–$362K total compensation with $180K–$200K in RSUs over four years. My accept-at floor is $325K TC with strong equity. I'd also like to discuss a $35K sign-on bonus and a management bonus target of 18% tied to team delivery and retention metrics. This reflects the strategic importance of the API security EM role at Akamai."
