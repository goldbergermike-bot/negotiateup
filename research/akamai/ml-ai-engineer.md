### ML/AI Engineer | Akamai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Edge & API Security | 150B API Attacks | Agentic Commerce | +15-25% AI Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge (MA) | $175K–$215K | $90K–$165K | 12–18% | $240K–$315K |
| San Francisco | $185K–$228K | $100K–$180K | 12–18% | $258K–$338K |
| Remote US | $165K–$200K | $80K–$148K | 12–15% | $225K–$298K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Akamai build the machine learning models that detect, classify, and block API attacks across the world's largest edge network — a network that recorded 150 billion API attacks. Your models operate at a scale and latency requirement that few ML engineers ever encounter: real-time inference at the edge, across billions of daily requests, with zero tolerance for false negatives. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects the extreme scarcity of ML engineers who can build production models at cybersecurity scale. As Agentic Commerce creates new patterns of AI agent behavior, your models become the intelligence layer that distinguishes legitimate autonomous transactions from sophisticated AI-driven attacks.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai ML/AI Engineer = Google ML Engineer L5–L6 / Meta ML Engineer (E5–E6) / Amazon Applied Scientist (L6–L7)
- Akamai Senior ML/AI Engineer = Google L6+ / OpenAI Research Engineer / Anthropic ML Engineer
- Expected 5–10+ years of experience in ML engineering with production deployment at scale, ideally in security, anomaly detection, or real-time systems
- +15-25% AI Premium over equivalent SWE levels reflects market demand for ML expertise in cybersecurity

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

The 150 billion API attacks recorded by Akamai are the training data for the most consequential ML models in cybersecurity. As an ML/AI Engineer, you build the models that process this data in real time — classifying attack patterns, detecting zero-day API exploits, and adapting to adversarial evasion techniques. This is not academic ML; this is production machine learning where model accuracy directly determines whether billions of dollars in API transactions are protected or compromised. With Agentic Commerce accelerating, your models face a new challenge: AI agents as both users and attackers. You must build models that understand legitimate AI agent transaction patterns while detecting AI-powered attacks that mimic normal agent behavior. This adversarial ML challenge at the intersection of AI security and Agentic Commerce is the cutting edge of the field. Negotiate for the +15-25% AI Premium aggressively. Frame your value as building the intelligence layer for the AI economy's security infrastructure. The 150B stat proves the scale of data your models process, and the Agentic Commerce trend proves the growing complexity of the problem. Push for top-band RSUs, a significant sign-on bonus, and a research/conference budget as part of your package.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Premium Lever:** "ML/AI engineers with production cybersecurity experience command a 15-25% premium over equivalent SWE roles. My models process 150 billion API attacks — that scale of production ML in security is rare. My comp should include the full AI premium."

2. **Adversarial ML Lever:** "Building models that detect AI-powered attacks while permitting legitimate AI agent transactions is an adversarial ML challenge at the frontier of the field. This cutting-edge expertise warrants top-band compensation and equity acceleration."

3. **Agentic Commerce Intelligence Lever:** "My models will be the intelligence layer that enables Agentic Commerce — distinguishing between legitimate AI agent transactions and AI-driven attacks. This is a defining capability for Akamai's competitive position in the AI economy."

4. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have offers from CrowdStrike ($305K TC), Palo Alto Networks ($298K TC), and a late-stage AI security startup ($320K TC with early equity). Given Akamai's unmatched 150B attack dataset, I'd prefer to build here — but the comp needs to reflect the AI premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm deeply excited about building ML models on Akamai's 150 billion API attack dataset — the richest training data in cybersecurity — and developing the intelligence layer for Agentic Commerce security. My competing offers are $305K TC from CrowdStrike, $298K TC from Palo Alto Networks, and $320K TC from an AI security startup. I'm targeting $305K–$315K total compensation at Akamai with $150K–$165K in RSUs over four years, reflecting the full 15-25% AI premium. My accept-at floor is $290K TC with strong equity. I'd also like a $40K sign-on bonus, a $10K annual conference/research budget, and a 18% bonus target. This package reflects the AI premium, the adversarial ML complexity, and the strategic importance of ML engineering for Akamai's API security platform."
