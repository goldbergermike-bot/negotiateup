**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Akamai build and maintain the data pipelines, storage systems, and analytics infrastructure that process the telemetry from 150 billion API attacks. You are responsible for ensuring that petabytes of threat data flow reliably from 4,100+ edge locations into the detection, analytics, and reporting systems that power Akamai's API security platform. As Agentic Commerce generates exponentially more API transaction data, your data engineering expertise becomes the foundation upon which all security intelligence is built.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai Data Engineer = Google Data Engineer L4–L5 / Meta Data Engineer (IC4–IC5) / Amazon Data Engineer (L5–L6)
- Akamai Senior Data Engineer = Google L5–L6 / Snowflake Senior DE / Databricks Senior DE
- Expected 4–8+ years of experience in data engineering with expertise in streaming data, distributed systems, and large-scale data pipelines

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

The 150 billion API attacks recorded by Akamai generate a data engineering challenge of staggering proportions. Every attack creates telemetry — source IP, payload signature, timing, target endpoint, response code — and your job is to ensure this data flows reliably through pipelines that operate at petabyte scale, in real time, across a globally distributed edge network. With Agentic Commerce on the rise — AI agents generating massive volumes of API transaction data — your pipelines must scale to handle both legitimate agent traffic and attack data without latency or data loss. Negotiate premium compensation by emphasizing that data engineering at Akamai's scale is fundamentally different from data engineering anywhere else. The 150B attack stat quantifies the volume you process, and the Agentic Commerce growth trajectory means your pipelines must continuously scale. Push for RSUs that reflect your role as the infrastructure backbone for Akamai's entire threat intelligence and API security operation.

**Global Levers**

1. **Pipeline Scale Lever:** "I'll be building data pipelines that process telemetry from 150 billion API attacks — petabytes of streaming data from 4,100+ edge locations. This scale of real-time data engineering is virtually unmatched and warrants top-band compensation."

2. **Agentic Commerce Data Growth Lever:** "As AI agents drive exponential growth in API traffic, my pipelines must scale continuously. The data engineering challenges of Agentic Commerce are just beginning — my equity should reflect this growth trajectory."

3. **Foundation Infrastructure Lever:** "Every detection model, every analytics dashboard, and every threat report depends on the data pipelines I build. I'm the foundation layer — if my pipelines fail, the entire API security platform is blind."

4. **Competing Offer Lever:** "I have offers from Snowflake ($235K TC) and Databricks ($240K TC) for large-scale data engineering roles. Given the unique scale and security criticality of Akamai's data infrastructure, I'd prefer to be here — but the comp needs to reflect that."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about data engineering at Akamai's scale — building pipelines that process 150 billion API attacks and scaling for Agentic Commerce growth. My competing offers are $235K TC from Snowflake and $240K TC from Databricks. I'm targeting $238K–$245K total compensation at Akamai with $90K–$100K in RSUs over four years. My accept-at floor is $225K TC with strong equity. I'd also like a 15% bonus target and a $15K sign-on bonus. The data engineering challenges at Akamai are uniquely compelling — the package should reflect the critical infrastructure nature of this role."
