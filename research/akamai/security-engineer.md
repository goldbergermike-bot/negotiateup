### Security Engineer | Akamai Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + Bonus | Edge & API Security | 150B API Attacks | Agentic Commerce | Security Domain Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Cambridge (MA) | $155K–$190K | $70K–$125K | 10–15% | $208K–$275K |
| San Francisco | $165K–$200K | $75K–$135K | 10–15% | $225K–$295K |
| Remote US | $145K–$178K | $60K–$110K | 10–12% | $198K–$260K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Akamai are on the front lines of the 150 billion API attack war. You build the detection engines, write the threat rules, and develop the response systems that protect the world's largest enterprises from API exploitation. This is not security theater — this is operational cybersecurity at a scale that defines the industry. As Agentic Commerce introduces AI agents as both potential victims and potential attack vectors, your security engineering expertise becomes even more critical and more rare.

**Level Mapping:**
- Akamai Security Engineer = Google Security Engineer L4–L5 / Meta Security Engineer (IC4–IC5) / CrowdStrike Engineer (L5–L6)
- Akamai Senior Security Engineer = Google L5–L6 / Palo Alto Networks Senior Engineer
- Expected 5–10+ years of experience in security engineering, with expertise in API security, threat detection, WAF/bot management, or application security

**Ghost API Security — The 150 Billion Attack Premium**

As a Security Engineer at Akamai, the 150 billion API attack stat is not just a headline — it is the literal output of the systems you build and maintain. You are the engineer who writes the detection rules, tunes the ML models, and architects the response systems that identify and block malicious API traffic at a scale no other company approaches. With Agentic Commerce accelerating — AI agents autonomously executing transactions through APIs — you will be building security systems that distinguish between legitimate AI agent transactions and AI-powered attacks. This is a brand-new security domain, and engineers who can operate in it are extraordinarily scarce. Negotiate aggressively: demand top-band base salary, premium RSUs, and a sign-on bonus. Frame your expertise as defending the trust layer of the AI economy. The 150B stat is proof of the problem's scale, and your engineering skill is the solution. Akamai cannot afford to lose Security Engineers in a market where API security talent is the scarcest resource in cybersecurity.

**Global Levers**

1. **Frontline Defense Lever:** "I'll be building the detection and response systems that process 150 billion API attacks. This is frontline cybersecurity engineering at the highest scale in the industry — my comp should reflect that I'm at the tip of the spear."

2. **AI Agent Security Lever:** "Distinguishing between legitimate AI agent transactions and AI-powered attacks is a brand-new security challenge in Agentic Commerce. Engineers with this emerging expertise command a significant premium."

3. **Talent Scarcity Lever:** "API security engineers with production experience at this scale are among the rarest talent in cybersecurity. Competing offers from CrowdStrike ($265K TC) and Palo Alto Networks ($260K TC) reflect this scarcity."

4. **Threat Intelligence Contribution Lever:** "My detection rules and threat models directly contribute to Akamai's published threat intelligence — content that drives brand authority and customer acquisition. This thought leadership impact warrants a premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm passionate about API security at Akamai's scale — building the detection systems that handle 150 billion attacks and pioneering AI agent security for Agentic Commerce. My competing offers are $265K TC from CrowdStrike and $260K TC from Palo Alto Networks. I'm targeting $268K–$275K total compensation at Akamai with $115K–$125K in RSUs over four years. My accept-at floor is $250K TC with strong equity. I'd also like a 15% bonus target and a $25K sign-on bonus. Akamai's unmatched scale in API security is what draws me — the comp needs to match the criticality and scarcity of this role."
