**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Global Payments during the Worldpay era are not running business-as-usual teams. They are leading integration squads through the most complex payment technology merger in history — the $24B Worldpay re-integration that demands unifying engineering cultures, tech stacks, and operational practices across 100+ countries. Your teams are building the unified commerce platform that serves 4M+ merchant locations, and your ability to retain and motivate engineers through a multi-year integration determines whether GPN captures its projected synergies.

The Synergy Architect philosophy applies uniquely to Engineering Managers because you are the ones who translate architectural vision into team execution. You staff the integration workstreams, resolve the cross-team dependencies, and make the build-vs-migrate decisions that determine integration velocity. Payment Orchestration at GPN's scale requires managers who understand both distributed systems and distributed teams — engineers in Atlanta, New York, London, and beyond, all working toward a unified platform. With $9B+ in revenue at stake, the margin for management error is razor-thin, and GPN's leadership knows that experienced engineering managers are the bottleneck to integration success.

### Worldpay Re-Integration — The Synergy Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Integration Team Leadership Premium:** "Managing engineering teams through the $24B Worldpay re-integration is fundamentally different from managing a steady-state product team. I'll be navigating competing tech stacks, cultural integration, and aggressive synergy timelines simultaneously. That integration leadership premium should be reflected in a base of at least $230,000 (Atlanta) or $260,000 (NYC)."

**Lever 2 — Cross-Border Team Orchestration:** "The unified commerce platform spans 100+ countries, which means I'll be managing distributed teams across time zones and regulatory environments. That cross-border Payment Orchestration leadership capability is rare in the market, and my compensation should reflect the complexity of coordinating engineering execution at this global scale."

**Lever 3 — Synergy Architect Retention Multiplier:** "As an Engineering Manager, my primary job is retaining the Synergy Architects on my team through the critical integration period. If I lose a Staff engineer mid-integration, it costs GPN 6-12 months of progress. My compensation should include an RSU package of $240,000-$300,000 that signals to my direct reports that GPN values long-term commitment — I can't credibly advocate for retention if my own package doesn't reflect it."

**Lever 4 — Integration Velocity Accountability:** "I'll be directly accountable for integration velocity metrics — how quickly my teams unify merchant data and payment processing across the Worldpay and legacy GPN platforms. That's a measurable business outcome tied to billions in synergy value. I'd like a performance bonus structure that rewards hitting integration milestones, with a guaranteed floor of 20% of base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $230,000 base (Atlanta) / $260,000 (NYC) with $240,000-$300,000 RSUs over 4 years. Lead with the integration team leadership premium — managing through a $24B merger is not standard engineering management. Push for a $30,000-$45,000 sign-on bonus and a guaranteed bonus floor of 20% base. Your accept-at floor should be $190,000 base (Atlanta) / $215,000 (NYC) with at least $150,000 RSU. If they counter below floor, request a title bump to "Senior Engineering Manager" and a guaranteed 12-month RSU refresh. Frame everything through the Synergy Architect lens: you are the multiplier that determines whether the integration engineers on your team deliver. Total first-year comp target: $400,000+ (Atlanta) / $480,000+ (NYC).
