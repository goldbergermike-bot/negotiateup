**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Global Payments are building the intelligence layer for the largest payment platform unification in history. The $24B Worldpay re-integration creates a training dataset of unprecedented scale — combined transaction data from 4M+ merchant locations across 100+ countries, spanning every payment modality, currency, and merchant category. For an ML engineer, this is a once-in-a-career opportunity to build models on a dataset that no competitor can replicate.

The Payment Orchestration platform is fundamentally an ML problem at scale. Intelligent transaction routing — selecting the optimal acquirer, network, and processing path for each transaction in real time — requires ML models that can predict authorization rates, minimize processing costs, and detect fraud across a globally distributed merchant base. The Synergy Architect vision for an ML/AI engineer is about leveraging the merged Worldpay-GPN dataset to build models that are categorically better than what either company could build alone. These models directly drive $9B+ in revenue by improving authorization rates (each basis point worth millions), reducing fraud losses, and enabling predictive merchant analytics that increase platform stickiness. GPN competes for ML talent against FAANG, top hedge funds, and AI startups — all of which offer aggressive compensation — making the negotiation dynamics particularly favorable for candidates with payment domain expertise.

### Worldpay Re-Integration — The Synergy Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Merged Dataset Intelligence Premium:** "The $24B Worldpay re-integration creates the most comprehensive payment transaction dataset in the industry. As an ML/AI Engineer, I'll be the first to build models on combined data from 4M+ merchant locations across 100+ countries. That dataset advantage translates directly to model performance that no competitor can match, and my compensation should reflect the strategic value of this work — I'm targeting a base of $200,000 (Atlanta) or $230,000 (NYC)."

**Lever 2 — Payment Orchestration ML Models:** "Intelligent Payment Orchestration — real-time transaction routing optimization — is fundamentally an ML problem. My models will determine which processing path each transaction takes, directly impacting authorization rates and processing costs across GPN's entire transaction volume. Each basis point of authorization improvement is worth millions in annual revenue. The RSU package should reflect that P&L impact: $160,000-$210,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Synergy Architect Model Leverage:** "The Synergy Architect vision for ML is about building models that could not exist without the Worldpay re-integration — cross-border fraud detection, global merchant risk scoring, and unified transaction intelligence. These models represent the deepest moat GPN will build from the merger. I'd like a sign-on bonus of $25,000-$35,000 that reflects the strategic nature of this AI/ML investment."

**Lever 4 — ML Talent Market Competition:** "ML/AI engineers with payment domain expertise are being recruited by Google, Meta, Stripe, top quantitative hedge funds, and AI startups — many offering $400K+ total comp. I'm choosing GPN because of the Worldpay integration data opportunity, but the total comp needs to be competitive. I'd like accelerated first-year RSU vesting at 30% and a guaranteed RSU refresh at 12 months."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $200,000 base (Atlanta) / $230,000 (NYC) with $160,000-$210,000 RSUs over 4 years. Lead with the merged dataset intelligence premium — no other company in payment technology can offer an ML engineer this training data advantage. Push for a $25,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus and accelerated first-year vesting at 30%. Your accept-at floor should be $165,000 base (Atlanta) / $190,000 (NYC) with at least $100,000 RSU. If they counter below, negotiate for a Senior ML Engineer title, a guaranteed Year 1 RSU refresh, and a defined scope commitment to Payment Orchestration ML models. Frame yourself as the Synergy Architect who builds the intelligence layer that justifies the $24B Worldpay investment. Total first-year comp target: $320,000+ (Atlanta) / $400,000+ (NYC).
